    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the reaction product:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The reactants are butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Butadiene is a conjugated diene, and the ethene derivative is an alkene (a dienophile). This combination is characteristic of a Diels-Alder reaction.\n2.  **Understand the Mechanism:** The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The four pi electrons from the diene and the two pi electrons from the dienophile react in a concerted step to form a new six-membered ring. In this new ring, two new single bonds (sigma bonds) and one new double bond (pi bond) are formed.\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure:** The reaction will form a cyclohexene ring. The four carbon atoms from butadiene and the two carbon atoms from 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene will make up the ring. The carbons from the dienophile will be adjacent in the ring, with one carbon bonded to two chlorine atoms and the other to two fluorine atoms.\n4.  **Name the Product:** The resulting structure is named according to IUPAC nomenclature. It is a cyclohexene derivative. By numbering the ring to give the double bond the lowest position (C1-C2) and then assigning the lowest numbers to the substituents based on alphabetical order (chloro- before fluoro-), we arrive at the final name.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** A Python script will be created to display the full reaction equation, clearly stating the reactants and the final product with their names and chemical formulas.\n\n```python\ndef get_diels_alder_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function describes the Diels-Alder reaction between butadiene and\n    1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene and prints the reaction equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define Reactants ---\n    reactant_1_name = \"Butadiene\"\n    reactant_1_formula = \"C4H6\"\n\n    reactant_2_name = \"1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene\"\n    reactant_2_formula = \"C2Cl2F2\"\n\n    # --- Determine Product ---\n    # The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition which forms a cyclohexene ring.\n    # Following IUPAC naming conventions for the resulting structure:\n    product_name = \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\"\n    product_formula = \"C6H6Cl2F2\"\n\n    # --- Print the Reaction Equation ---\n    print(\"The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder reaction.\")\n    print(\"The chemical equation for this reaction is:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation, which includes all the required numbers in names and formulas.\n    print(f\"{reactant_1_name} ({reactant_1_formula}) + {reactant_2_name} ({reactant_2_formula}) -> {product_name} ({product_formula})\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\nget_diels_alder_product()\n```\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
