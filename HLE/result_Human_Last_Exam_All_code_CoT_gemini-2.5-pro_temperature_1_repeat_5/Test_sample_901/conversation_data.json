    "My plan is to solve this organic chemistry problem by breaking it down into logical steps.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**: I will identify the substrate ((1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane) and the reagent (potassium tert-butoxide).\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type**: Based on the reactants (a secondary alkyl halide) and the reagent (a strong, bulky base), I will identify the reaction mechanism as an E2 elimination.\n3.  **Analyze Stereochemistry**: I will analyze the stereochemistry of the substrate. An E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring requires a specific arrangement: the leaving group and a beta-hydrogen must be *trans-diaxial*. I will determine which chair conformation of the substrate allows for this arrangement.\n4.  **Identify Potential Products**: From the reactive conformation, I will identify all possible beta-hydrogens that can be eliminated, leading to different alkene products. This will result in a Zaitsev (more substituted) product and a Hofmann (less substituted) product.\n5.  **Apply Regioselectivity**: The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product depends on the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base, which favors the removal of the less sterically hindered proton, leading to the Hofmann product.\n6.  **State the Final Product**: I will conclude by naming the major product of the reaction.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this reasoning step-by-step and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    with potassium tert-butoxide and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reactants and reaction type\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing the reaction of {substrate} with {reagent}.\")\n    print(\"This is a classic E2 elimination reaction, as we have a secondary alkyl halide reacting with a strong, bulky base.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the conformational requirements for the E2 reaction\n    print(\"Step 2: Conformational Analysis\")\n    print(\"The E2 mechanism on a cyclohexane ring requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (H) to be in a trans-diaxial orientation (both in axial positions, on adjacent carbons).\")\n    print(f\"The substrate {substrate} is a cis-isomer.
