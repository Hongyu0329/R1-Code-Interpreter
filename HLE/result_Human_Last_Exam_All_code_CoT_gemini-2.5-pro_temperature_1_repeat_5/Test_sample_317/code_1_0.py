    Analyzes Kenneth Burke's concept of the "Tribal No"
    to determine if it belongs to the realm of motion or action.
    """

    # Kenneth Burke's key distinctions:
    # Motion: The realm of the purely physical, non-symbolic. (e.g., a rock falling)
    # Action: The realm of the symbolic, involving choice, motive, and language. (e.g., giving a speech)
    # The Negative ("No"): A purely symbolic, linguistic invention that creates choice and morality. It does not exist in nature/motion.

    # Analysis of the "Tribal No":
    # 1. The "Tribal No" refers to social prohibitions and taboos ("Thou shalt not...").
    # 2. These prohibitions are based on the negative, which is a symbolic concept.
    # 3. They govern human choice and behavior, which is the definition of action.
    # 4. Therefore, the "Tribal No" is in the realm of Action.

    choices = {
        'A': "Action; it is imaginal.",
        'B': "Motion; it is abstract.",
        'C': "Neither; the Tribal No is in the realm of social imagination.",
        'D': "Motion; it is sensory.",
        'E': "Action; it is rational."
    }

    # Why 'A' is the best fit:
    # The "Tribal No" exists in the collective, symbolic imagination of a community.
    # It is a socially constructed reality that guides behavior.
    # The term 'imaginal' perfectly captures this symbolic, non-physical nature.
    # While action can be 'rational' (E), 'imaginal' is a broader and more fitting Burkean term
    # for foundational social rules that may also be mythical or traditional.
    correct_choice_key = 'A'
    
    print("Explanation:")
    print("Kenneth Burke distinguishes 'motion' (the non-symbolic, physical realm) from 'action' (the symbolic realm of human choice and motive).")
    print("The concept of the 'No' or the 'negative' is, for Burke, a purely symbolic inventionâ€”it does not exist in nature. It is the foundation of morality and prohibition.")
    print("The 'Tribal No' refers to the foundational prohibitions of a society. Since it is based on the symbolic negative and governs human choice, it must be in the realm of Action.")
    print("Of the 'Action' choices, 'imaginal' is the best descriptor because these social rules exist in the collective, symbolic imagination of the community, forming a constructed reality. This is a more precise Burkean term than 'rational' for rules often rooted in myth and tradition.")
