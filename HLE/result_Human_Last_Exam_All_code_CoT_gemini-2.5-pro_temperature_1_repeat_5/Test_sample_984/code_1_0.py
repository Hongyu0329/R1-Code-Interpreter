# Define the number of successful wells and total sorted wells
successful_wells = 4
total_sorted_wells = 95

# Calculate the efficiency
efficiency = (successful_wells / total_sorted_wells) * 100

# Print the final equation and the result
print(f"The final equation is: ({successful_wells} / {total_sorted_wells}) * 100")
print(f"The experimental efficiency is: {efficiency:.2f}%")
