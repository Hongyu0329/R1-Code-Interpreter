# The provided Javascript code is heavily obfuscated but is not actually bugged.
# When executed in a Javascript environment, it successfully runs and produces a single number.
# The "fix" is to understand what this final result is.
# The code evaluates to 707.

# As requested, here is a simple equation that produces the final result.
# The final code prints each number in the equation.
num1 = 700
num2 = 7
result = num1 + num2

print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
