    1. The group G is isomorphic to Thompson's group F.
    2. The homology of F is related to the homology of Z^2 via a spectral sequence argument,
       because the commutator subgroup [F,F] is acyclic.
       H_k(G, R) is isomorphic to H_k(Z^2, R).
    3. The classifying space for Z^2 is the 2-torus, T^2.
    4. The dimension of the k-th homology group of the n-torus T^n (its Betti number b_k)

    5. We need to calculate dim H_31(T^2, R), which is C(2, 31).
