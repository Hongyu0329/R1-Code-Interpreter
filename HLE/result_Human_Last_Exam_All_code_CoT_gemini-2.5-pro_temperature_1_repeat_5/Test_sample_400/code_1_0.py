    # The space X' is the union of the following line segments, with the origin excluded:
    # C_0 = {(x, 0) | 0 < x <= 1}
    # C_n = {(t, t/n) | 0 < t <= 1} for n = 1, 2, 3, ...

    # A connected component is a maximal connected subset.
    # The components partition the space. We count these partitions.

    # Analysis shows that each segment C_k (for k=0, 1, 2, ...) is a connected component.
    # Let's take C_1 as an example. It is connected. To be a component, it must
    # be separated from the rest of the space (X' \ C_1).
    # A point in C_1, say (t, t) with t>0, is at a positive distance from
    # any other segment C_k (k != 1). This allows us to find a neighborhood
    # around any point of C_1 that does not intersect the rest of the space.
    # This proves that C_1 is open. A similar argument shows it's also closed.
    # Since C_1 is a connected, non-empty, proper clopen subset, it is a component.
    
    # This same logic applies to C_2, C_3, ... and also to C_0.
    # Therefore, the connected components are the individual sets:
    # C_0, C_1, C_2, C_3, ...
    
    # Counting these components gives one for each non-negative integer.
