    "To determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group Structure:** A reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is necessarily split. This is because the Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group, which means there are no twisted forms arising from diagram automorphisms (like $^2E_6$). Furthermore, a theorem by Steinberg states that any semisimple algebraic group over a finite field is quasi-split, which in the case of $E_8$ implies it must be split.\n\n2.  **Apply Steinberg's Theorem:** A theorem by Robert Steinberg states that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the ratio $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| / |T(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$, where $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$, and $T$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus that is maximally split.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Order of the Group:** For a split simple group of type $X_n$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the order of the group of its rational points is given by the formula:\n    $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (q^{d_i} - 1)$\n    For the group $E_8$:\n    *   The rank $n$ is 8.\n    *   The number of positive roots $N$ is 120.\n    *   The degrees of the fundamental invariants $d_i$ are 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, and 30.\n    So, $|E_8(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{120} (q^2 - 1)(q^8 - 1)(q^{12} - 1)(q^{14} - 1)(q^{18} - 1)(q^{20} - 1)(q^{24} - 1)(q^{30} - 1)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Order of the Torus:** A maximally split torus $T$ of rank 8 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{G}_m)^8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points is $|T(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |\\mathbb{F}_q^*|^8 = (q - 1)^8$.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Final Expression:** By dividing the order of the group by the order of the torus, we get the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. I will now use a Python script to construct and display this final formula, explicitly mentioning the numbers involved as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_e8_tori_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs and prints the formula for the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n    in a reductive group of type E_8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the E_8 group structure\n    rank = 8\n    num_positive_roots = 120\n    degrees = [2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30]\n\n    # Construct the numerator of the formula\n    numerator_parts = [f\"(q^{d} - 1)\" for d in degrees]\n    numerator_str = f\"q^{num_positive_roots} * {' * '.join(numerator_parts)}\"\n\n    # Construct the denominator of the formula\n    denominator_str = f\"(q - 1)^{rank}\"\n\n    # Final formula\n    final_formula = f\"({numerator_str}) / ({denominator_str})\"\n\n    print(\"The exact number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a group of type E_8 is given by the formula:\")\n    print(final_formula)\n    print(\"\\nAs requested, here are the specific numbers that appear in the equation, based on the E_8 root system:\")\n    print(f\"- The exponent in the denominator is the rank of E_8: {rank}\")\n    print(f\"- The exponent of the leading q term in the numerator is the number of positive roots of E_8: {num_positive_roots}\")\n    print(f\"- The exponents in the factors (q^d - 1) are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of E_8: {degrees}\")\n\nprint_e8_tori_formula()\n```\n<<<(q^120 * (q^2 - 1) * (q^8 - 1) * (q^12 - 1) * (q^14 - 1) * (q^18 - 1) * (q^20 - 1) * (q^24 - 1) * (q^30 - 1)) / ((q - 1)^8)>>>"
