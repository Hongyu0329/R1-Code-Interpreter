# This script calculates the minimum value of q such that Alice's winning probability is at least 95%.

# The relationship between Alice's winning probability (p) and the edge probability (q) is:
# p = 1 - (1 - q^4 * p^3)^3
# We need to solve for q when p = 0.95.

# The numbers derived from the problem description and the equation are:
p_target = 0.95
power_of_q = 4  # From Alice's move (1) + Bob's counter-moves (3)
power_of_p = 3  # From the number of children
outer_power = 3 # From the number of children

print("To find the minimum q, we solve the equation for q with p set to its target value.")
print(f"The final equation for q is: q = ((1 - (1 - p)^(1/{outer_power})) / p**{power_of_p})**(1/{power_of_q})")
print(f"We will use the following numbers in our calculation:")

print(f"Power of p = {power_of_p}")
print(f"Power of q = {power_of_q}")

# Perform the calculation step by step
p = p_target

# Calculate the numerator: 1 - (1 - p)^(1/3)
one_minus_p = 1 - p
root_term = one_minus_p**(1/outer_power)
numerator = 1 - root_term

# Calculate the denominator: p^3
denominator = p**power_of_p

# Calculate q^4
q_raised_to_power = numerator / denominator

# Calculate q (let's call it q0)
q0 = q_raised_to_power**(1/power_of_q)

# The problem asks for floor(100 * q0)
final_value = 100 * q0
answer = math.floor(final_value)
