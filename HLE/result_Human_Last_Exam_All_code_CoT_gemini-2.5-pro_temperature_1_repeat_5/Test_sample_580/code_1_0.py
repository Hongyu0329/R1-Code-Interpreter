    # Step 1: Summarize the key clinical findings.
    print("Clinical Analysis Steps:")
    print("1. Patient presents with right lower extremity pain in an L4-S1 distribution, suggestive of sciatic nerve irritation.")
    print("2. A key negative finding is an 'unremarkable' X-ray, which makes bony pathologies like fractures, severe arthritis, or obvious tumors less likely.")
    print("3. The pain pattern and negative X-ray point towards a soft tissue cause, such as Piriformis Syndrome, where the piriformis muscle irritates the sciatic nerve.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the physical exam setup.
    print("\n4. The physical exam involves the patient lying on their left side (left decubitus) with the affected right leg extended. The physician applies resistance to an action performed by the patient.")
    print("5. This setup is designed to provoke pain by forcing a specific muscle to contract against resistance.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the likely diagnosis of Piriformis Syndrome.
    print("\n6. To confirm Piriformis Syndrome, the maneuver must test the piriformis muscle itself.")
    print("7. The primary anatomical function of the piriformis muscle is EXTERNAL ROTATION of the hip.")

    # Step 4: Conclude the correct maneuver.
    print("\n8. Evaluating the choices:")
    print("   - A. Abduction: Primarily tests the gluteus medius and minimus.")
    print("   - B. Adduction: Tests the adductor muscles of the inner thigh.")
    print("   - C. Internal Rotation: Tests the internal rotator muscles (e.g., anterior gluteus medius/minimus). Passively, this would stretch the piriformis.")
    print("   - D. External Rotation: Directly engages the piriformis muscle. Resisting this motion would cause the muscle to contract, reproducing pain if it is the source of the problem. This is a classic provocative test for Piriformis Syndrome.")
    print("   - E. Flexion: Tests hip flexors (e.g., iliopsoas).")
    print("   - F. Extension: Tests the gluteus maximus and hamstrings.")

    print("\nConclusion: The action that will confirm the diagnosis of Piriformis Syndrome in this context is resisting external rotation.")
