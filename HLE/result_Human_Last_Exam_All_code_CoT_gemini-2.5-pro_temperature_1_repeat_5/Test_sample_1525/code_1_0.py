# This script is designed to provide the answer to the user's question.
# The user wants to know the number of correct statements among the given five options (A, B, C, D, E).

# My analysis of each statement is as follows:
# Statement A: Correct. The segregation process is defined using an "order of appearance", which is ill-defined for a set-based Datalog program.
# Statement B: Correct. The statement correctly questions whether the segregation and aggregation processes can be reversed, which is not obvious given the flawed definition of segregation.
# Statement C: Correct. It accurately describes the information loss from the many-to-one mapping `gamma`, meaning `gamma_inv(gamma(P))` does not necessarily equal `P`.
# Statement D: Correct. Similar to A, it points out the ambiguity of applying the segregation operator to the fact set S0.
# Statement E: Incorrect. It misinterprets the claim by stating the operations have "no effect". The claim is about the equivalence of the final results of two different computational paths, not about the intermediate steps having no effect.

# Count the number of correct statements.
correct_statements_count = 4

# Print the final count.
print(correct_statements_count)
