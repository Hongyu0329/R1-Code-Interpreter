    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of independent variables required to describe the bosonic sector of the specified supersymmetric sigma-model. This number is equivalent to the dimension of the target manifold for the bosonic fields.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Manifold:** For the supersymmetric sigma-model in symmetry class D with `n` replicas, the target space for the bosonic fields is a mathematical structure known as a Riemannian symmetric space. Specifically, it is the product of two such spaces, one corresponding to compact and the other to non-compact degrees of freedom. The manifold is `M_B = [O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))] x [Sp(2n) / (Sp(n) x Sp(n))]`.\n2.  **Use Dimension Formulas:** The dimension of a quotient manifold `G/H` is calculated as `dim(G) - dim(H)`. We will use the standard formulas for the dimensions of the orthogonal group `O(k)` and the symplectic group `Sp(2k)`.\n    *   `dim(O(k)) = k * (k - 1) / 2`\n    *   `dim(Sp(2k)) = k * (2k + 1)`\n3.  **Calculate for n=2:** We will substitute `n=2` into the formulas to find the dimensions of the two parts of the manifold and then sum them to get the total number of variables.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bosonic_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the SUSY sigma-model\n    in class D with n=2 replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of replicas is specified as 2.\n    n = 2\n\n    # Dimension formula for the orthogonal group O(k).\n    def dim_O(k):\n        return k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n    # Dimension formula for the compact symplectic group Sp(2k).\n    # The formula is dim(Sp(2k)) = k(2k+1).\n    def dim_Sp(k_param):\n        return k_param * (2 * k_param + 1)\n\n    print(\"The total number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of the bosonic target manifold.\")\n    print(\"For class D with n replicas, this is dim[O(2n)/(O(n)xO(n))] + dim[Sp(2n)/(Sp(n)xSp(n))].\")\n    print(f\"We are given n = {n}.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Part 1: Dimension of the compact sector O(4) / (O(2) x O(2)) ---\n    print(\"1.
