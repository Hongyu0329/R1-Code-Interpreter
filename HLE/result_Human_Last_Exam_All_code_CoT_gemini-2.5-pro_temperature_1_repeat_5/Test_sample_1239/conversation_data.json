    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of time, space, velocity, and pressure that leave the equations unchanged. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters that define these transformations.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  List the distinct types of symmetries admitted by the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n2.  For each type of symmetry, determine the number of independent parameters it contributes (i.e., its dimension).\n3.  Sum these dimensions to find the total dimension of the full Lie group of symmetries.\n\nThe symmetries are:\n*   **Time translation:** Shifting the time origin ($t \\to t + a$). This is a 1-parameter transformation.\n*   **Spatial translations:** Shifting the spatial origin ($\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$). In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this gives 3 independent parameters.\n*   **Spatial rotations:** Rotating the coordinate system ($\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$). The rotation group in 3D, SO(3), has dimension 3.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame ($\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$). The boost velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ provides 3 parameters.\n*   **Scaling (Dilation):** A specific scaling of all variables ($t \\to \\lambda^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$). This is a 1-parameter transformation.\n*   **Pressure shift:** Shifting the pressure by a constant ($p \\to p + c$), which leaves the pressure gradient $\\nabla p$ unchanged. This is a 1-parameter transformation.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the sum of these dimensions.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    The dimension is the sum of the dimensions of its constituent symmetry subgroups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dimension from time translation (t -> t + a)\n    dim_time_translation = 1\n\n    # Dimension from spatial translations (x -> x + b) in R^3\n    dim_space_translations = 3\n\n    # Dimension from spatial rotations (x -> Rx) in R^3\n    dim_rotations = 3\n\n    # Dimension from Galilean boosts (u -> u + v) in R^3\n    dim_galilean_boosts = 3\n\n    # Dimension from scaling transformations\n    dim_scaling = 1\n\n    # Dimension from pressure shift (p -> p + c)\n    dim_pressure_shift = 1\n\n    # Total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of all symmetry groups.\n    total_dimension = (dim_time_translation +\n                       dim_space_translations +\n                       dim_rotations +\n                       dim_galilean_boosts +\n                       dim_scaling +\n                       dim_pressure_shift)\n\n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is the sum of the dimensions of each symmetry type:\")\n    print(f\"Time Translation: {dim_time_translation}\")\n    print(f\"Spatial Translations: {dim_space_translations}\")\n    print(f\"Spatial Rotations: {dim_rotations}\")\n    print(f\"Galilean Boosts: {dim_galilean_boosts}\")\n    print(f\"Scaling: {dim_scaling}\")\n    print(f\"Pressure Shift: {dim_pressure_shift}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    # The final instruction asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"Total Dimension = {dim_time_translation} + {dim_space_translations} + {dim_rotations} + {dim_galilean_boosts} + {dim_scaling} + {dim_pressure_shift} = {total_dimension}\")\n\ncalculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"
