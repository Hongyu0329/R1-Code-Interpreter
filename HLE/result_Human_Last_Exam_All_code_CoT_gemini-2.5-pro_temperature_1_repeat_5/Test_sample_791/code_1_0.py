    print("2. Checking for a longest sentence:")
    print("   - The rule 'REC = REC ADJ' allows generating an arbitrarily long sequence of adjectives.")
    print("   - This means the language is infinite and has no longest sentence.")

    print("--- Evaluating Statement B ---")
    print("Statement: RD accepts 'snake big jump well.' but PR does not.")
    print("1. Checking sentence validity: 'snake big jump well.'")
    print("   - The noun 'snake' is not in the grammar (only 'snakes').")
    print("   - The adjective 'big' is not in the grammar.")
    print("   - The sentence is not in the language L, so neither parser would accept it.")
    print("Result: Statement B is FALSE.\n")

    # --- Statement C ---
    print("--- Evaluating Statement C ---")
    print("Statement: Both RD and PR accept 'jump or alike frog swiftly.' and do not run inifinitely.")
    print("1. Checking sentence validity: 'jump or alike frog swiftly.'")
    print("   - The sentence must start with a Subject (S), but it starts with a Verb (V) 'jump'.")
    print("   - The sentence is not in the language L.")
    print("Result: Statement C is FALSE.\n")

    # --- Statement D ---
    print("--- Evaluating Statement D ---")
    print("Statement: Neither RD nor PR can be implemented because the grammar contains left recursion.")
    print("1. Checking implementability:")
    print("   - The parsers can be implemented. They would just fail on inputs requiring the 'REC' rule.")
    print("   - They would succeed on other valid sentences like 'frogs swim well.'")
    print("   - The statement 'cannot be implemented' is too strong and therefore incorrect.")
    print("Result: Statement D is FALSE.\n")
