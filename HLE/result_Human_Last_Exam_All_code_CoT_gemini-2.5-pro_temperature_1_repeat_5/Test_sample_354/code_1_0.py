    This function explains Alan Bryman's theory of Disneyization and identifies
    the correct characteristics from the given multiple-choice options.

    explanation = """
In "The Disneyization of Society" (2004), Alan Bryman outlines four primary characteristics of Disneyization:

1.  **Theming:** The creation of an immersive environment through the application of a narrative or theme.
2.  **Hybrid Consumption:** The blending of different forms of consumption, such as shopping, dining, and entertainment, into a single experience.
3.  **Merchandising:** The sale of branded goods that promote and are part of the themed experience.
4.  **Performative Labor:** The requirement for employees to perform their roles theatrically, managing their emotions and actions as if they are 'cast members' in a show.

Based on these four dimensions, we can evaluate the choices:
- Choice A ('hybrid consumption' and 'merchandising') lists two correct dimensions.
- Choice G ('theming' and 'performative labor') also lists two correct dimensions.

While both A and G are technically correct, 'theming' and 'performative labor' are often considered the most foundational aspects of the theory, representing the transformation of physical space and human labor, respectively, which are central to creating the Disney experience.
