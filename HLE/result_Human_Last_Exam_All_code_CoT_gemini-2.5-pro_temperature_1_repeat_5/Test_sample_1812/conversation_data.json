    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix A. The reference to the \"Markov quiver\" and \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) appears to be supplementary information, as the core task is to find the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix.\n\nI will use Python to perform this calculation. The `numpy` library is well-suited for matrix operations, but to fulfill the request of showing the step-by-step calculation, I will manually implement the determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix and print out each stage of the computation.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  Define the matrix `A` in Python.\n2.  Use the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix, which is derived from cofactor expansion:\n    `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n3.  I will write a script that substitutes the numerical values from matrix `A` into this formula.\n4.  The script will then print the equation with all the numbers, followed by the simplification steps, and finally the resulting determinant. This will satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n`det(A) = 2 * (2*2 - (-1)*(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)*2 - (-1)*(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 2*(-1))`\n`det(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)`\n`det(A) = 2 * (3) - 3 - 3`\n`det(A) = 6 - 6 = 0`\n\nThe Python code below will automate and display this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem asks to compute the determinant of the matrix A.\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Extract elements for clarity in the explanation.\n# Matrix A = [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# The determinant of a 3x3 matrix is calculated using the formula:\n# det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n# The script will now print out the steps of this calculation.\n\nprint(\"The matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nTo compute the determinant, we use the cofactor expansion formula:\")\nprint(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Substituting the values from matrix A, the final equation and its calculation are:\")\n\n# Calculate the values of the cofactors\nval1 = e * i - f * h\nval2 = d * i - f * g\nval3 = d * h - e * g\n\n# Calculate the full terms\nterm1 = a * val1\nterm2 = -b * val2\nterm3 = c * val3\n\n# Final result\nfinal_result = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a}(({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b})(({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c})(({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\nprint(f\"       = {a}({e*i} - {f*h}) - ({b})({d*i} - {f*g}) + ({c})({d*h} - {e*g})\")\nprint(f\"       = {a}({val1}) - ({b})({val2}) + ({c})({val3})\")\nprint(f\"       = {term1} + ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\nprint(f\"       = {final_result}\")\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"
