    "Based on the scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022), the lacrimal recess is a large, triangular fossa. This main depression contains two smaller, but significant, openings known as pneumatic foramina. The question asks how many depressions the lacrimal recess *contains*, which refers to these two foramina within the larger recess.\n\nI will write a Python script to state this fact and print the number.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the answer to a specific paleontological question.\n# The information is derived from scientific literature describing the skull\n# of the dinosaur Irritator challengeri.\n# The lacrimal recess itself is a large depression, and within it,\n# there are two smaller openings (pneumatic foramina).\n\n# Define the number of depressions (foramina) contained within the lacrimal recess.\ndepressions_in_recess = 2\n\n# Print the result in a clear statement.\nprint(\"The number of depressions (pneumatic foramina) contained within the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri is:\")\nprint(depressions_in_recess)\n```\n<<<2>>>"
