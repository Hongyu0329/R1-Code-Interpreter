# This script provides the answer to a specific paleontological question.
# The information is derived from scientific literature describing the skull
# of the dinosaur Irritator challengeri.
# The lacrimal recess itself is a large depression, and within it,
# there are two smaller openings (pneumatic foramina).

# Define the number of depressions (foramina) contained within the lacrimal recess.
depressions_in_recess = 2

# Print the result in a clear statement.
