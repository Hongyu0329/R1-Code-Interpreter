    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will define what a minimal grid diagram for a trefoil knot is. A grid diagram is represented by a pair of permutations on an n x n grid. For the trefoil knot, the minimal grid number is n=3. A diagram represents a trefoil knot if and only if the product of the 'O' permutation and the inverse of the 'X' permutation is a 3-cycle.\n2.  I will write a Python script to generate all 12 possible minimal grid diagrams for the trefoil knot.\n3.  Next, I will define the equivalence relations: translation and rotation. These operations form a group of symmetries that act on the set of diagrams.\n    *   **Translation**: A diagram can be shifted horizontally or vertically, with wrap-around.\n    *   **Rotation**: A diagram can be rotated by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.\n4.  The main task is to partition the 12 diagrams into equivalence classes (orbits) under this group of symmetries. I will implement a standard algorithm (related to Breadth-First Search) to find these orbits.\n5.  The number of orbits found will be the number of unique diagrams up to these symmetries. The problem of distinguishing which orbit corresponds to the left-hand trefoil can be resolved by noting that the set of left-hand trefoil diagrams and the set of right-hand trefoil diagrams are mirror images of each other. The mirror image of a grid diagram `(X, O)` is simply `(O, X)`. The code will verify that the found orbits are indeed mirror images of each other.\n6.  Finally, the number of diagrams for the left-hand trefoil will be the number of orbits corresponding to one chirality. Based on the analysis, we expect to find two orbits, meaning there is one unique diagram for the left-hand trefoil.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef get_inverse_permutation(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inverse = [0] * len(p)\n    for i, val in enumerate(p):\n        inverse[val] = i\n    return tuple(inverse)\n\ndef compose_permutations(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the composition p1 o p2.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p1)\n    result = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        result[i] = p1[p2[i]]\n    return tuple(result)\n\ndef is_n_cycle(p):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a permutation is a single cycle of length n.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    if n == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    visited = [False] * n\n    count = 0\n    current = 0\n    while not visited[current]:\n        visited[current] = True\n        current = p[current]\n        count += 1\n    \n    # It's an n-cycle if we visited all elements and returned to the start\n    return count == n and all(visited)\n\ndef find_trefoil_diagrams(n):\n    \"\"\"Finds all n x n grid diagrams that represent a trefoil knot.\"\"\"\n    perms = list(itertools.permutations(range(n)))\n    trefoil_diagrams = []\n    \n    # A diagram (X, O) is a trefoil if O * X^-1 is a 3-cycle\n    three_cycles = [p for p in perms if is_n_cycle(p)]\n    \n    if not three_cycles:\n        return [], []\n\n    # Let's designate one 3-cycle for RH and the other for LH\n    # This is a convention, the orbits will determine the true chirality sets\n    rh_cycle = three_cycles[0]\n    lh_cycle = three_cycles[1]\n    \n    for x_perm in perms:\n        x_inv = get_inverse_permutation(x_perm)\n        # Find O such that O * X^-1 = cycle, so O = cycle * X\n        o_perm_rh = compose_permutations(rh_cycle, x_perm)\n        o_perm_lh = compose_permutations(lh_cycle, x_perm)\n        trefoil_diagrams.append( (x_perm, o_perm_rh) )\n        trefoil_diagrams.append( (x_perm, o_perm_lh) )\n        \n    return trefoil_diagrams\n\ndef apply_symmetries(diagram, n):\n    \"\"\"Applies all translation and rotation symmetries to a diagram.\"\"\"\n    x, o = diagram\n    generated_diagrams = set()\n\n    # Translations\n    for r_shift in range(n):\n        for c_shift in range(n):\n            # Row shift\n            x_rs = tuple(x[(i -
