# Step 1: Correct the prefix provided in the riddle.
# The fragment "Cafi." is a phonetic clue that is correctly written as "Café".
corrected_prefix = "Café"

# Step 2: Identify the name of the "peculiar" item.
# Christian's preferred "peculiar shape" coffee beans are peaberries.
# The novel's character would know them by their Spanish name, "Caracolillo".
peculiar_name = "Caracolillo"

# Step 3: Combine the parts to form the full name.
# This follows an equation-like structure: Part 1 + Part 2 = Full Name.
full_name = corrected_prefix + " " + peculiar_name

# Step 4: Print the components of the "equation" and the final answer.
print(f"Part 1 (Corrected Prefix): {corrected_prefix}")
print(f"Part 2 (Peculiar Bean Name): {peculiar_name}")
print(f"Final Name = {corrected_prefix} + {peculiar_name}")
print(f"The correct name is: {full_name}")
