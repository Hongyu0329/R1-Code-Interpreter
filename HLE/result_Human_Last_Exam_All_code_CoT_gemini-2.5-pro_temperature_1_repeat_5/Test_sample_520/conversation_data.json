    "My plan is to find the factual answer to your historical question and then present it using a simple Python script. The script will store the answer in a variable and then print it out for you.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking for the true profession of Andre Vernault.\n# This is a known piece of historical trivia related to WWII counterintelligence.\n# He was suspected because he was secretive, but the reason for his secrecy\n# was the embarrassing (at the time) nature of his real job.\n\n# Storing the profession in a variable.\ntrue_profession = \"a writer of pornographic novels\"\n\n# Printing the answer.\nprint(f\"Andre Vernault concealed his true profession from interrogators, which was that he was {true_profession}.\")\n\n```\n<<<a writer of pornographic novels>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
