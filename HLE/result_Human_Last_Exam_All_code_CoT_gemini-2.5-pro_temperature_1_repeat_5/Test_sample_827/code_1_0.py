    print("The reaction describes a sequential substitution on Compound A by two nucleophiles: tert-butyl hydrazine and benzylamine. The NMR data of the product reveals several key pieces:")
    print("  - From benzylamine: We see signals for a phenyl group (¹H: δ 7.37 – 7.22, 5H), a CH₂ group (¹H: δ 4.73, 2H), and its attached NH (¹H: δ 8.69, 1H). This confirms a benzylamino group (-NH-CH₂-Ph).")
    print("  - From tert-butyl hydrazine: A sharp singlet for 9 protons (¹H: δ 1.70, 9H) confirms a tert-butyl group.")
    print("  - The Heteroaromatic Core: Two singlets in the aromatic region (¹H: δ 8.24, 1H and δ 8.11, 1H) indicate two protons on a heteroaromatic ring that are not coupled to each other.")

    print("\nStep 2: Assemble the Structure of the Final Product.")
    print("The fragments must be attached to a central ring. The two uncoupled ring protons are a classic sign of a pyrimidine ring substituted at positions 4 and 6. This places the protons at C-2 and C-5, which are too far apart to couple.")
    print("Therefore, the product is 4-(benzylamino)-6-(2-tert-butylhydrazinyl)pyrimidine.")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Identify the Starting Material (Compound A).")
    print("The reaction involves replacing two groups on the pyrimidine core with the nucleophiles. Since the product is substituted at the 4 and 6 positions, Compound A must have had leaving groups at these same positions.")
    print("The use of a base (DIPEA) to neutralize acid suggests the leaving groups were halogens. The most common precursor for such reactions is a dichlorinated heterocycle.")
    
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Based on this evidence, the starting material, Compound A, is 4,6-dichloropyrimidine.")
