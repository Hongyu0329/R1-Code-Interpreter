    "To determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we can perform a case-by-case analysis. This is a combinatorial problem in category theory.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Mandatory Morphisms**: A category with 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must have an identity morphism for each object. These are `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`.\n2.  **Account for Remaining Morphisms**: We are given 4 morphisms in total. Since 2 are identities, we have 2 other non-identity morphisms to place, let's call them `f` and `g`.\n3.  **Categorize by Structure**: The structure of the category depends on the source and target objects of `f` and `g`, and the rules for their composition. We can classify all possibilities by considering the \"graph\" of the category (where the arrows `f` and `g` go) and then analyzing the required composition rules for each graph.\n4.  **Enumerate and Sum**: We will count the number of non-isomorphic categories for each structural case and sum the results.\n\nThe cases are based on how the two non-identity morphisms, `f` and `g`, are distributed among the four possible `Hom-sets`: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(B, B)`, `Hom(A, B)`, and `Hom(B, A)`.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms\n    up to isomorphism by breaking the problem down into distinct cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the number of categories with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 morphisms,\")\n    print(\"we first note that 2 morphisms must be the identities id_A and id_B.\")\n    print(\"This leaves 2 non-identity morphisms, f and g, to place and define compositions for.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe can count the non-isomorphic categories by analyzing all possible structures:\\n\")\n    \n    # Case 1: Both f and g are endomorphisms (loops on an object).\n    # Subcase 1a: Both f and g map A to A.
