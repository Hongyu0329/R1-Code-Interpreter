    "This is a question from the mathematical field of topology, and its answer is a known theorem rather than the result of a calculation. I will explain the steps to arrive at the answer, which involves listing the distinct topological objects that fit the description.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Planar:** Can be embedded in the 2D plane (ℝ²).\n    *   **Homogeneous:** The space looks the same from every point. Formally, for any two points x and y, there's a homeomorphism (a structure-preserving map) of the space onto itself that takes x to y.\n    *   **Homeomorphism Class:** A category of topological spaces that are all equivalent (can be stretched, bent, and deformed into one another without cutting or gluing).\n\n2.  **Identify the Classes:** The problem asks for the total number of these distinct classes. A major theorem in continuum theory, resulting from the work of R. H. Bing, C. L. Hagopian, and J. T. Rogers, Jr., provides a complete classification. We need to list all the items in this classification.\n\n3.  **The Degenerate Case:** The simplest continuum is a single point. It is planar, compact, connected, and trivially homogeneous. This forms one class.\n\n4.  **The Non-Degenerate Cases:** The theorem states that any non-degenerate (i.e., not a single point) homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of three specific objects:\n    *   **The Circle:** This is the familiar, locally connected example.\n    *   **The Pseudo-arc:** A fascinating, snake-like continuum that is indecomposable (cannot be written as the union of two of its own proper subcontinua).\n    *   **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** A more complex object constructed by replacing each point of a circle with a pseudo-arc in a continuous way.\n\n5.  **Final Count:** By adding the single degenerate case to the three non-degenerate cases, we get the total number of classes. The \"equation\" to find the total is simply adding one for each class.\n\nThe following Python code enumerates these classes and prints the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the number of homeomorphism classes\n    of homogeneous planar continua based on the established mathematical theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The classification of homogeneous planar continua is a known theorem in topology.\")\n    print(\"There are four distinct homeomorphism classes:\\n\")\n\n    # Class 1: The degenerate case (a single point)\n    # A single point is a continuum that is both planar and homogeneous.\n    point_class = 1\n    print(f\"1. The degenerate continuum (a single point). Count: {point_class}\")\n\n    # Class 2: The circle\n    # The circle (S¹) is the only non-degenerate, locally connected,\n    # homogeneous planar continuum.\n    circle_class = 1\n    print(f\"2. The circle. Count: {circle_class}\")\n\n    # Class 3: The pseudo-arc\n    # The pseudo-arc is a non-locally connected, indecomposable continuum.\n    pseudo_arc_class = 1\n    print(f\"3. The pseudo-arc. Count: {pseudo_arc_class}\")\n\n    # Class 4: The circle of pseudo-arcs\n    # This is a continuum constructed from a circle and pseudo-arcs.\n    circle_of_pseudo_arcs_class = 1\n    print(f\"4. The circle of pseudo-arcs. Count: {circle_of_pseudo_arcs_class}\")\n\n    # Calculate the total number of classes\n    total_classes = point_class + circle_class + pseudo_arc_class + circle_of_pseudo_arcs_class\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of classes is the sum of these individual cases.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n\n    # Output each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"{point_class} + {circle_class} + {pseudo_arc_class} + {circle_of_pseudo_arcs_class} = {total_classes}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, there are {total_classes} homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\")\n\nsolve_topology_question()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
