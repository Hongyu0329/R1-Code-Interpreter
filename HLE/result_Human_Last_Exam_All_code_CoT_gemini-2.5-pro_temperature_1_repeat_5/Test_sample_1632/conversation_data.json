    "To find a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, I will write a Python script. The script will use a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore and count all valid paths.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  The core of the solution is a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks(steps, x, y, visited)`. This function calculates the number of valid paths from a given point `(x, y)` with a specific number of `steps` left to take.\n2.  To ensure the \"self-avoiding\" rule, the function will keep track of all visited points in a `set` called `visited`. A move is only valid if the destination point is not in this set.\n3.  The recursion's base case is when `steps` equals 0. This signifies the successful completion of one valid walk, and the function returns 1.\n4.  To make the computation more efficient, I'll leverage the symmetry of the grid. All four starting directions (up, down, left, right) will yield the same number of paths. Therefore, I can calculate the number of paths for one starting direction (e.g., moving from (0,0) to (0,1)) and multiply the result by 4 to get the total.\n5.  The main script will set `n=10` and initiate the calculation using this symmetry optimization. Finally, it will print the result in the requested format \"a(10) = [result]\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    This script is specifically written to compute a(10).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the desired number of steps for the walk.\n    n_steps = 10\n    \n    # Increase the recursion limit for safety, although n=10 should not exceed the default.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(max(sys.getrecursionlimit(), n_steps + 5))\n\n    # A dictionary for memoization could be used but is complex due to the `visited` set.\n    # For n=10, a direct recursive approach is feasible.\n    memo = {}\n\n    def count_walks(steps, x, y, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n        Args:\n            steps (int): The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            visited (frozenset): A frozenset of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n                                 Using frozenset allows for memoization.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have successfully found one valid path.\n        if steps == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        # Memoization: Check if we have already computed the result for this state.\n        state = (steps, x, y, visited)\n        if state in memo:\n            return memo[state]\n\n        count = 0\n        # Define the four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n        moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]\n\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # Check if the next point has already been visited.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n                # If the point is new, continue the walk from there.\n                # A new visited set is created for the next recursive call.\n                new_visited = visited.union({(next_x, next_y)})\n                count += count_walks(steps - 1, next_x, next_y, new_visited)\n\n        # Store the result in the memoization table and return it.\n        memo[state] = count\n        return count\n\n    # Handle the trivial case of a 0-step walk.\n    if n_steps == 0:\n        result = 1\n    else:\n        # Optimization: Utilize the symmetry of the lattice.\n        # The number of walks starting with a step in any of the 4 directions is the same.\n        # We calculate the number of walks for one initial move (e.g., to (0,1))\n        # and multiply by 4.
