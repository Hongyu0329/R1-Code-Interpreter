    This script calculates the theoretical completeness bound for an ontology mapping
    based on information-theoretic principles.

    The problem describes a mapping from an ontology O1 (with mergeable siblings)
    to an ontology O2 (with a strict hierarchy). The loss of completeness is due to this
    structural mismatch. Statement D provides the most appropriate model for this scenario.

    The formula for the bound is: ln(b) / d
    - 'b' is the branching factor, representing the richness of choices at each level.
      The information content is proportional to ln(b).
    - 'd' is the depth, representing the length of hierarchical chains. Information
      preservation becomes harder with increasing depth, hence it is in the denominator.
    - The "mergeable-like constraints" are the root cause of this theoretical limit.
