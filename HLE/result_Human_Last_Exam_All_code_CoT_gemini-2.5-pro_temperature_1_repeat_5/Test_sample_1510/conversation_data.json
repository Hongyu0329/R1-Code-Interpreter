    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Point Groups of Order 2:** In two dimensions, a point group's order is the number of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) it contains. We need to find the point groups that have exactly two operations. These are:\n    *   **C2:** Contains the identity and a 180-degree (2-fold) rotation.\n    *   **D1 (also known as C1h or Cs):** Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\n2.  **Map Wallpaper Groups to Point Groups:** There are 17 wallpaper groups in total. We need to determine the point group for each one and check if its order is 2.\n\n3.  **Count the Matches:** We will create a data structure (a dictionary in Python) that maps each of the 17 wallpaper groups to the order of its point group. Then, we will iterate through this data, count how many have an order of 2, and print the names of those groups.\n\n4.  **Display the Final Sum:** Finally, we will display the total count as a simple sum.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of wallpaper groups that have a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to the order of its point group.\n    # The point group (or crystal class) determines the rotational and reflectional symmetry at a point.\n    # C_n has order n.
