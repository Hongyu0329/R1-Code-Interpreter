    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects**: We are given a genus `g=3` Riemann surface `C` and its 15th symmetric power, `X = C^(15)`. We need to find the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted `ρ(X)`.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of a symmetric power**: For a smooth projective curve `C` of genus `g` and its d-th symmetric power `C^(d)`, there is a fundamental relationship between the rank of the Néron-Severi group of `C^(d)` and that of the Jacobian of `C`, `Jac(C)`. When `d ≥ g`, the symmetric power `C^(d)` is a projective bundle over `Jac(C)`. This structure leads to the formula:\n    `ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`\n    In our case, `g = 3` and `d = 15`, so the condition `15 ≥ 3` is satisfied.\n\n3.  **Determine the possible range for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian**: The rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension `g` (like `Jac(C)`) is bounded. The bounds are:\n    `1 ≤ ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ g^2`\n    For `g = 3`, this means `1 ≤ ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 3^2 = 9`.\n\n4.  **Find the smallest possible rank**: The smallest rank, `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`, is achieved for a \"generic\" curve `C`. For such curves, the Jacobian has the minimal possible number of endomorphisms, which leads to the minimal rank for the Néron-Severi group.\n\n5.  **Find the largest possible rank**: The largest rank, `ρ(Jac(C)) = g^2 = 9`, is achieved for special curves, particularly those whose Jacobians have \"complex multiplication\" (CM). An example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian has this property is the Klein quartic curve.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final results**: By substituting the minimum and maximum values of `ρ(Jac(C))` into the formula from Step 2, we can find the smallest and largest possible ranks for `ρ(X)`.\n    *   Smallest `ρ(X)` = (Smallest `ρ(Jac(C))`) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Largest `ρ(X)` = (Largest `ρ(Jac(C))`) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nNow, here is the Python code that implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_neron_severi_rank_bounds():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Genus of the Riemann surface C\n    g = 3\n    \n    # Degree of the symmetric power\n    d = 15\n    \n    # The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(d) is given by\n    # rho(X) = rho(Jac(C)) + 1, where Jac(C) is the Jacobian of C.\n    # This formula holds because d >= g.\n    \n    # The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus g curve, rho(Jac(C)),\n    # is bounded by 1 and g^2.\n    \n    # Smallest possible rank for rho(Jac(C)) (for a generic curve)\n    min_rank_jac = 1\n    \n    # Largest possible rank for rho(Jac(C)) (for a curve with complex multiplication)\n    max_rank_jac = g**2\n    \n    # Calculate the smallest possible rank for X\n    min_rank_X = min_rank_jac + 1\n    \n    # Calculate the largest possible rank for X\n    max_rank_X = max_rank_jac + 1\n    \n    print(\"Problem: Find the smallest and largest rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 curve.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the curve C is g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Find the bounds for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian, rho(Jac(C)).\")\n    print(f\"The rank is bounded by 1 <= rho(Jac(C)) <= g^2.\")\n    print(f\"Smallest rho(Jac(C)) = {min_rank_jac}\")\n    print(f\"Largest rho(Jac(C)) = {g}^2 = {max_rank_jac}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Use the formula rho(X) = rho(Jac(C)) + 1 to find the bounds for rho(X).\")\n    print(f\"Smallest possible rank of NS(X) = {min_rank_jac} + 1 = {min_rank_X}\")\n    print(f\"Largest possible rank of NS(X) = {max_rank_jac} + 1 = {max_rank_X}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The smallest rank is {min_rank_X} and the largest rank is {max_rank_X}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_neron_severi_rank_bounds()\n```\n<<<2, 10>>>"
