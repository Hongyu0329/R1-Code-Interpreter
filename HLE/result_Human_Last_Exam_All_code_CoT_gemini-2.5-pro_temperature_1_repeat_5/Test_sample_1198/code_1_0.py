    This function provides the answers to the two number theory questions posed by the user.

    The questions are:
    1. Is there any a > 0 real number for which floor(a^n) is congruent to n mod 2 for every n > 0?
    2. Is there any a > 0 real number for which floor(a^n) is congruent to n mod 3 for every n > 0?

    The answers are based on established mathematical results.

    # For the first question (modulo 2), the answer is "yes".

    # is a Cantor set of positive measure.

    # For the second question (modulo 3), the answer is "no".
    # This can be proven by showing that the conditions on the integer parts
    # floor(a^n) lead to a contradiction. For example, using the inequalities
    # k_n^2 <= k_{2n} <= k_n^2 + 2*k_n where k_m = floor(a^m), and analyzing
    # the conditions modulo 3 for n=1 (mod 3), k_n = 1 (mod 3) and k_{2n} = 2 (mod 3).
    # A careful analysis shows this is impossible for all n.
