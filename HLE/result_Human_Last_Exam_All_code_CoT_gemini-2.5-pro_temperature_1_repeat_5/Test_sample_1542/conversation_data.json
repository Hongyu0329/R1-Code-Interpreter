    "To find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R=\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, we can follow a computational approach.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent Quadratic Forms**: A quadratic form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ in two variables over $R$ is uniquely determined by the triplet of coefficients $(a, b, c)$, where $a, b, c \\in R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. There are $8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512$ such forms in total.\n\n2.  **Equivalence Relation**: Two quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation $T \\in GL_2(R)$ such that $Q_2(v) = Q_1(T(v))$ for all vectors $v = (x, y) \\in R^2$. The set of all forms equivalent to a given form is its equivalence class, also known as its orbit under the action of the group $GL_2(R)$.\n\n3.  **Orbit Computation**: Our goal is to partition the set of all 512 forms into these disjoint equivalence classes and count them. We can do this by iterating through every possible form. For each form, if it has not been classified yet, we start a search (like Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) to find all other forms belonging to its orbit.\n\n4.  **Group Generators**: To find the entire orbit of a form, we don't need to apply every matrix in the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$. It is sufficient to repeatedly apply a set of generator matrices until no new forms are found. The group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by:\n    *   Shear matrices: $E_{12}(\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\lambda \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $E_{21}(\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\lambda & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ for all $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Scaling matrices: $D(u, v) = \\begin{pmatrix} u & 0 \\\\ 0 & v \\end{pmatrix}$ for all units $u, v \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times = \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n    *   The swap matrix: $W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. (While this can be generated by the others, including it can simplify and speed up the orbit discovery).\n\n5.  **Algorithm**:\n    *   Create a set of all 512 forms `(a, b, c)`.\n    *   Maintain a set of `classified_forms` to keep track of forms whose class has already been found.\n    *   Initialize a counter for the number of classes to zero.\n    *   Loop through each of the 512 forms. If a form is not yet in `classified_forms`, it represents a new equivalence class.\n    *   Increment the class counter. Then, perform a search starting from this new form to find its entire orbit. Add all forms in the orbit to `classified_forms`.\n    *   The final value of the counter is the total number of equivalence classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this computational plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring Z/8Z.\n\n    A quadratic form is ax^2 + bxy + cy^2, represented by a tuple (a, b, c).\n    Two forms Q1 and Q2 are equivalent if Q2(v) = Q1(T(v)) for some\n    invertible linear transformation T in GL_2(Z/8Z).\n\n    The script iterates through all possible forms, and for each unclassified\n    form, it computes the entire equivalence class (orbit) using a set of\n    generators for GL_2(Z/8Z).
