    "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal way to pack 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes gives an upper limit (15*15*15 / 9 = 375), but this doesn't account for the physical constraints of packing.\n\nOur strategy will be to use a greedy approach, partitioning the cube into sections and filling each section as densely as possible. This is a common and effective method for solving packing problems.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **First, we fill the largest possible slab.** We take the 15x15x15 cube and orient the 9x1x1 blocks with their 9-unit length along one of the cube's axes. This fills a `15 x 15 x 9` volume completely. The number of blocks in this section is `(15/1) * (15/1) * (9/9) = 225`. This leaves a remaining volume of `15 x 15 x 6`.\n\n2.  **Next, we pack the remaining `15 x 15 x 6` volume.** We cannot orient the 9-unit length of the blocks along the 6-unit side. We must orient it along one of the 15-unit sides. This allows us to fill a `15 x 9 x 6` section of the remaining space. The number of blocks is `(15/1) * (9/9) * (6/1) = 90`. This leaves a new remaining volume of `15 x 6 x 6`.\n\n3.  **Then, we pack the `15 x 6 x 6` volume.** Again, we must orient the 9-unit length along the only available side, the 15-unit one. This fills a `9 x 6 x 6` section. The number of blocks is `(9/9) * (6/1) * (6/1) = 36`.\n\n4.  **Finally, we are left with a `6 x 6 x 6` cube.** Since the longest side of our block is 9, no more blocks can fit into this remaining space.\n\n5.  **The total number of blocks** is the sum of the blocks from each step: 225 + 90 + 36.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Pack a 15x15x9 slab within the 15x15x15 cube.\n    # Orient blocks as 1x1x9.\n    # Number of blocks = floor(15/1) * floor(15/1) * floor(9/9)\n    blocks_1 = math.floor(15/1) * math.floor(15/1) * math.floor(9/9)\n\n    # This leaves a 15x15x6 remaining volume.\n\n    # Step 2: Pack a 15x9x6 slab within the 15x15x6 remaining volume.\n    # Orient blocks as 1x9x1.\n    # Number of blocks = floor(15/1) * floor(9/9) * floor(6/1)\n    blocks_2 = math.floor(15/1) * math.floor(9/9) * math.floor(6/1)\n\n    # This leaves a 15x6x6 remaining volume.\n\n    # Step 3: Pack a 9x6x6 slab within the 15x6x6 remaining volume.\n    # Orient blocks as 9x1x1.\n    # Number of blocks = floor(9/9) * floor(6/1) * floor(6/1)\n    blocks_3 = math.floor(9/9) * math.floor(6/1) * math.floor(6/1)\n\n    # The final remaining volume is 6x6x6, where no 9x1x1 block can fit.\n\n    # Total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from each step.\n    total_blocks = blocks_1 + blocks_2 + blocks_3\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers calculated in each step.\n    print(f\"The largest number of blocks is the sum of blocks from each packing step:\")\n    print(f\"Total blocks = {blocks_1} + {blocks_2} + {blocks_3} = {total_blocks}\")\n\nsolve_packing()\n```\n<<<351>>>"
