    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify any PLL case, we need to find the smallest number of stickers that provides a unique signature for each of the 21 possible permutations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Information Theory:** First, we'll consider the theoretical minimum. There are 21 PLL cases. The side stickers of the top layer can be one of four colors. We need to find the smallest number of stickers, `n`, such that 4^n is at least 21.\n    *   4¹ = 4 (not enough)\n    *   4² = 16 (not enough)\n    *   4³ = 64 (theoretically enough)\n    So, the absolute minimum is 3.\n\n2.  **Counterexample Proof:** We will test this theoretical minimum. I will write a Python script to model the stickers of the last layer. The script will demonstrate that for a specific set of 3 stickers, at least two different PLL cases (the Jb-Perm and Ga-Perm) produce the exact same visible sticker pattern. This proves that 3 stickers are not sufficient.\n\n3.  **Demonstrate Sufficiency:** The script will then add one more sticker to the set (for a total of 4) and show that this new set of stickers *can* distinguish between the previously ambiguous cases.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since 3 stickers are insufficient, and 4 stickers can resolve the ambiguity (and it's known that a set of 4 stickers can distinguish all 21 cases), we can conclude that 4 is the minimum number required. The code will print this final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_pll_state(solved_state, permutation_map):\n    \"\"\"Applies a PLL permutation to the solved state.\"\"\"\n    new_state = solved_state.copy()\n    for target_sticker, source_sticker in permutation_map.items():\n        new_state[target_sticker] = solved_state[source_sticker]\n    return new_state\n\ndef get_signature(state, stickers_to_check):\n    \"\"\"Gets the color pattern for a given list of stickers.\"\"\"\n    return tuple(state[sticker] for sticker in stickers_to_check)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of stickers to see to identify a PLL case.\n    We use a standard color scheme: Front=Red, Right=Green, Back=Orange, Left=Blue.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 12 non-top-facing stickers of a solved last layer\n    solved_state = {\n        'UFR_F': 'Red',   'UFR_R': 'Green',\n        'UFL_F': 'Red',   'UFL_L': 'Blue',\n        'UBL_B': 'Orange','UBL_L': 'Blue',\n        'UBR_B': 'Orange','UBR_R': 'Green',\n        'UF_F': 'Red',   'UR_R': 'Green', 'UB_B': 'Orange', 'UL_L': 'Blue'\n    }\n\n    # Permutation map for Jb-Perm (swaps UFR-UBL corners, UF-UL edges)\n    # The key is the target sticker position, the value is the source sticker position from the solved state.\n    jb_perm_map = {\n        'UFR_F': 'UBL_B', 'UFR_R': 'UBL_L', 'UBL_B': 'UFR_F', 'UBL_L': 'UFR_R',\n        'UF_F': 'UL_L', 'UL_L': 'UF_F'\n    }\n\n    # Permutation map for Ga-Perm (cycles UBL->UFR->UBR corners, UL->UF->UR edges)\n    ga_perm_map = {\n        'UFR_F': 'UBL_B', 'UFR_R': 'UBL_L', 'UBR_B': 'UFR_F', 'UBR_R': 'UFR_R', 'UBL_B': 'UBR_B', 'UBL_L': 'UBR_R',\n        'UF_F': 'UL_L', 'UR_R': 'UF_F', 'UL_L': 'UR_R'\n    }\n    \n    # Generate the full PLL states\n    jb_state = get_pll_state(solved_state, jb_perm_map)\n    ga_state = get_pll_state(solved_state, ga_perm_map)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Testing if 3 stickers are sufficient.\")\n    # We will look at the Front sticker of the UF edge, and the Front and Right stickers of the UFR corner.\n    stickers_to_check_3 = ['UF_F', 'UFR_F', 'UFR_R']\n    \n    jb_sig_3 = get_signature(jb_state, stickers_to_check_3)\n    ga_sig_3 = get_signature(ga_state, stickers_to_check_3)\n    \n    print(f\"Stickers observed: {stickers_to_check_3}\")\n    print(f\"Signature for Jb-Perm: {jb_sig_3}\")\n    print(f\"Signature for Ga-Perm: {ga_sig_3}\")\n    \n    if jb_sig_3 == ga_sig_3:\n        print(\"Result: The signatures are identical. 3 stickers are NOT enough to distinguish these cases.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Result: The signatures are different.\\n\")\n\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Testing if 4 stickers are sufficient.\")\n    # We add one more sticker to our view: the Right sticker of the UR edge.\n    stickers_to_check_4 = ['UF_F', 'UFR_F', 'UFR_R', 'UR_R']\n    \n    jb_sig_4 = get_signature(jb_state, stickers_to_check_4)\n    ga_sig_4 = get_signature(ga_state, stickers_to_check_4)\n\n    print(f\"Stickers observed: {stickers_to_check_4}\")\n    print(f\"Signature for Jb-Perm: {jb_sig_4}\")\n    print(f\"Signature for Ga-Perm: {ga_sig_4}\")\n\n    if jb_sig_4 != ga_sig_4:\n        print(\"Result: The signatures are now different.
