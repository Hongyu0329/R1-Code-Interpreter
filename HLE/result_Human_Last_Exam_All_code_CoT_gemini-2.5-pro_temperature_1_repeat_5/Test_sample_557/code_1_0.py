    # --- Legal Framework ---
    # The Working for Workers Act, 2021, amended the Employment Standards Act, 2000 (ESA).
    # This amendment banned non-competition agreements for most employees.
    # Key Date: The ban applies to agreements entered into on or after October 25, 2021.
    # The ban is NOT retroactive.
    #
    # Exceptions to the ban:
    # 1. Sale of a Business: The seller of a business becomes an employee of the buyer.
    # 2. "Executive" Employees: The ban does not apply to true executives.
    #
    # ESA Definition of "Executive":
    # Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Operating Officer,
    # Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Legal Officer,
    # Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Corporate Development Officer, or any other
    # chief executive position.
