# This script calculates the numerical value of the Lindhard polarization function,
# Pi_0(k, omega), for a 3D homogeneous electron gas at T=0, evaluated at
# zero momentum transfer (k=0) and zero frequency (omega=0).

# The parameters for the evaluation are:
momentum_transfer_k = 0
frequency_omega = 0

# In the framework of linear response theory, a probe with zero momentum transfer (k=0)
# corresponds to a spatially uniform potential. This potential couples to the total
# number of electrons in the system.
# For a homogeneous electron gas, the total number of particles is a conserved quantity.
# This means the system cannot change its total density in response to a uniform potential.
# As a result, the response function at exactly k=0 is identically zero for all frequencies.

# Therefore, the value of the Lindhard function at k=0 and omega=0 is 0.
final_value = 0

# The final equation is Pi_0(k=0, omega=0) = 0.
# We print the numerical result as requested.
