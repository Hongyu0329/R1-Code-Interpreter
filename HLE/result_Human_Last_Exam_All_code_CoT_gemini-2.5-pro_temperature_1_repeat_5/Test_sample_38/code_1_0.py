# The user wants to find the squared mass of the 6th degree of freedom
# in a modified theory of linearized gravity.

# The plan is to use the standard formulas for the masses of the tensor and
# scalar modes that arise from a general mass term, and apply them to the
# specific case given in the problem.

# D is the number of spacetime dimensions.
D = 4

# Let's represent the parameter m^2 from the Lagrangian symbolically for clarity.
m_squared_symbol = "m^2"

# The problem states that 5 degrees of freedom (the tensor modes)
# have a squared mass of m^2.
M_T_squared_str = m_squared_symbol

# The squared mass of the 6th degree of freedom (the scalar mode) needs to be calculated.
# The formula for the scalar's squared mass, M_S^2, is:
# M_S^2 = ( (D-2)*m_2_sq + 2*D*m_0_sq ) / (D-1)
# where the mass term is L = -m_2_sq * h_uv*h^uv - m_0_sq * h^2

# From the given Lagrangian term L = -(m^2/2) * h_uv*h^uv, we identify:
# m_2_sq corresponds to m^2/2
# m_0_sq corresponds to 0

# We will now print the calculation step-by-step.
# Note: The calculation will show the result in terms of m^2.
