    Solves the integer sequence puzzle.

    The given sequence is identified as OEIS A176043. This sequence consists of
    numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two fifth powers in two
    different ways (allowing positive or negative integers).

    The problem asks for the single known integer that completes the given list of six.
    This corresponds to the 7th term in the known sequence.
