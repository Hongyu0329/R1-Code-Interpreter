    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Spacetime Metric**: The problem describes the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, which is defined by the Schwarzschild metric. We will use spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$.\n2.  **Recall the Christoffel Symbol Formula**: The Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, are functions of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and its derivatives. The formula is $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} ( \\partial_\\nu g_{\\sigma\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{\\sigma\\nu} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu} )$, with an implied summation over the index $\\sigma$.\n3.  **Implement a Symbolic Calculation**: To perform the calculations accurately and avoid manual errors, we will use Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`.\n4.  **Define the Metric**: We will define the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and its inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ as symbolic matrices in `sympy`.\n5.  **Calculate Derivatives**: We will compute the partial derivatives of the metric components with respect to each coordinate.\n6.  **Iterate and Calculate**: We will loop through all 64 possible combinations of indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ and calculate the corresponding Christoffel symbol using its formula.\n7.  **Count and Display**: For each calculated symbol, we will simplify the resulting expression. If it is not zero, we will add it to a list and increment a counter.\n8.  **Final Output**: Finally, the code will print each non-zero symbol and its value, followed by the total count presented as a sum of 1s to show how the final number is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
