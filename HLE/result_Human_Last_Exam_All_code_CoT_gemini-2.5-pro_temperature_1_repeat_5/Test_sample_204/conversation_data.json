    "To determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we can use a key topological insight: the Hopf charge is an integer that corresponds to the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere S².\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Choose Two Points:** We will select two convenient regular points on the sphere S². Let's choose the \"South Pole,\" `n_S = (0, 0, -1)`, and a point on the equator, `n_E = (0, 1, 0)`.\n2.  **Find Preimages:** We will find the sets of points in the 3D space `(x, y, z)` that map to these two chosen points. These preimages will be closed curves in R³.\n    *   The vector field is given in spherical coordinates `n = (sin(G)cos(f), sin(G)sin(f), cos(G))`.\n    *   Preimage of `n_S = (0, 0, -1)` corresponds to `cos(G) = -1`, which means `G = π`. This occurs when `r2 = 0`, leading to a circle in the `z=0` plane: `x² + y² = 0.5`. Let's call this curve `C₁`.\n    *   Preimage of `n_E = (0, 1, 0)` corresponds to `cos(G) = 0` and `sin(f) = 1, cos(f) = 0`. This implies `G = π/2` and `f = π/2`. This leads to a loop in the `x=0` plane described by `(y² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²` with `y > 0`. Let's call this curve `C₂`.\n3.  **Calculate Linking Number:** The Hopf charge is the linking number of these two curves, `Lk(C₁, C₂)`. We can compute this using the Gauss linking integral:\n    `Lk(C₁, C₂) = (1 / 4π) ∮_C₁ ∮_C₂ (r₁ - r₂) ⋅ (dr₁ × dr₂) / |r₁ - r₂|³`\n4.  **Implement Numerically:** We will write a Python script to perform this double line integral numerically. This involves parameterizing the two curves and then using numerical quadrature routines from `scipy.integrate`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge by numerically computing the Gauss linking integral\n    for the preimages of two points on the sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    PI = np.pi\n    # Radius for the second curve C2, derived from G = PI/2\n    R = np.log(2) / 10.0\n\n    # Parameterization for curve C1 (preimage of the South Pole)\n    # C1: r1(t) = (sqrt(0.5)*cos(t), sqrt(0.5)*sin(t), 0)\n    def r1(t):\n        return np.array([np.sqrt(0.5) * np.cos(t), np.sqrt(0.5) * np.sin(t), 0.0])\n\n    def dr1_dt(t):\n        return np.array([-np.sqrt(0.5) * np.sin(t), np.sqrt(0.5) * np.cos(t), 0.0])\n\n    # Parameterization for curve C2 (preimage of an equatorial point)\n    # C2: r2(s) = (0, sqrt(0.5 + R*cos(s)), R*sin(s))\n    def r2(s):\n        return np.array([0.0, np.sqrt(0.5 + R * np.cos(s)), R * np.sin(s)])\n\n    def dr2_ds(s):\n        # Derivative of y2(s) w.r.t. s\n        dy2_ds = 0.5 * (1.0 / np.sqrt(0.5 + R * np.cos(s))) * (-R * np.sin(s))\n        # Derivative of z2(s) w.r.t. s\n        dz2_ds = R * np.cos(s)\n        return np.array([0.0, dy2_ds, dz2_ds])\n\n    # Integrand of the Gauss linking integral\n    # The inner integral is over s (from 0 to 2*pi) for a fixed t\n    def inner_integrand(s, t):\n        vec_r1 = r1(t)\n        vec_dr1 = dr1_dt(t)\n        vec_r2 = r2(s)\n        vec_dr2 = dr2_ds(s)\n\n        r1_minus_r2 = vec_r1 - vec_r2\n        r1_minus_r2_norm = np.linalg.norm(r1_minus_r2)\n\n        # Avoid division by zero if curves touch (they don't in this case)\n        if r1_minus_r2_norm < 1e-9:\n            return 0.0\n\n        # Numerator: (r1-r2) .
