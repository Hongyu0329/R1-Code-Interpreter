    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil sequences:\n\n1.  **Understand the Principles**: The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil is largely determined by the identity of the amino acids at the core \"a\" and \"d\" positions of its characteristic `abcdefg` heptad repeat. The packing of the side chains from these residues dictates the most stable configuration.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Motifs**: I will analyze each sequence to find well-established predictive motifs:\n    *   **Dimer Motifs**: Leucine (L) at 'a' and 'd' positions (`La-Ld`) is a classic dimer signal. Asparagine (N) at the 'a' position (`Na`) is also a very strong indicator of a parallel dimer.\n    *   **Trimer Motifs**: Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Leucine (L) at 'd' (`Ia-Ld`) can be dimeric or trimeric. However, the presence of a bulky Tryptophan (W) or a beta-branched amino acid like Threonine (T) at a core 'd' position strongly promotes a trimeric state. Polar residues like Glutamine (Q) at 'd' paired with Isoleucine at 'a' (`Ia-Qd`) also favor trimers.\n    *   **Tetramer Motifs**: The pairing of Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions (`Ia-Id`) is the most definitive signal for a tetramer, as this arrangement best accommodates the steric bulk of the Isoleucine side chains.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Sequence**: I will apply these rules to each of the five sequences to predict its state. For sequences with conflicting signals, I will weigh the evidence based on the strength and number of the motifs present.\n\n4.  **Construct Python Code**: I will create a Python script that automates this analysis. The script will:\n    *   Store the sequences in a list.\n    *   Contain a function that implements the logic described above to predict the state for a given sequence.\n    *   Iterate through the list of sequences, call the prediction function for each, and print the sequence, the reasoning for the prediction, and the resulting oligomeric state.\n    *   Finally, it will print the complete list of predicted states.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef predict_coiled_coil_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence based on key motifs.\n    This is a rule-based expert system, not a full biophysical simulation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Rule 1: Check for the definitive 'N at position a' dimer motif\n    # The motif is often E-N-A-A-L-K, where N is at 'a'\n    if \"ENAALK\" in sequence:\n        rationale = \"Contains an Asparagine (N) at a core 'a' position, which strongly favors dimerization.\"\n        return 2, rationale\n\n    # Rule 2: Check for the definitive 'I at a, I at d' tetramer motif\n    # This is characterized by many Isoleucines at potential a/d positions.\n    # A simple proxy is the high percentage of Isoleucine.\n    # The sequence 'EIAAIK' puts I at 'a' and 'I' at 'd'.\n    if \"EIAAIK\" in sequence:\n        rationale = \"Core positions are dominated by Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and 'd' positions.
