    "The protein you're asking about is a central component of the immune system's complement cascade. When this protein is activated and broken down, one of its fragments acts as a tag, marking amyloid deposits for destruction and removal by immune cells like macrophages.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that symbolically models this biological pathway. The script will:\n1.  Define the key protein, its breakdown products, and the other relevant components (amyloid, macrophage).\n2.  Print a step-by-step description of the process.\n3.  Show the \"equation\" of the protein breaking down, which leads to the tagging and subsequent engulfment of the amyloid.\n\n```python\ndef explain_amyloid_clearance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the biological process where the breakdown of a specific protein\n    facilitates the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the key biological entities\n    protein = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n    fragment_1 = \"C3a\"\n    fragment_2 = \"C3b\"\n    target = \"Amyloid\"\n    immune_cell = \"Macrophage\"\n\n    print(\"The breakdown of a key immune protein allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\")\n    print(\"Here is a step-by-step model of the process:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: The protein is cleaved (broken down)\n    print(\"Step 1: The protein is broken down into two main fragments.\")\n    print(\"The equation representing this breakdown is:\")\n    # The final equation with each component printed\n    print(f\"    {protein} -> {fragment_1} + {fragment_2}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: One fragment tags the target\n    print(f\"Step 2: The '{fragment_2}' fragment binds to the {target}, tagging it for removal.\")\n    print(f\"    This process is called opsonization.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: The immune cell recognizes the tag and engulfs the target\n    print(f\"Step 3: The {immune_cell} recognizes the '{fragment_2}' tag on the {target}.\")\n    print(f\"Step 4: The {immune_cell} then engulfs the tagged {target}, helping to clear it.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(f\"Therefore, the protein that, when broken down, allows for this process is {protein}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_amyloid_clearance()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
