    "My plan is to analyze the chess position provided in the FEN string to determine the best move for White.\n\n1.  I will first parse the FEN to understand the placement of all pieces for both White and Black.\n2.  I will identify the key strategic elements of the position, such as White's advanced d-pawn and Black's active queen.\n3.  I will evaluate the most promising candidate moves for White:\n    *   `Qxc5+`, which forces a queen trade. I will analyze the resulting pawn endgame.\n    *   `Qxf7`, which eliminates the pawn blocking White's passed pawn. I will analyze the consequences of this capture, particularly the potential for Black to give perpetual check.\n4.  By comparing the outcomes of these moves (a loss vs. a draw), I will determine the optimal move.\n5.  Finally, I will generate a Python script that prints this step-by-step analysis and presents the best move in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN).\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position from the FEN 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\n    and prints the reasoning to find the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    fen = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the chess position to find the best move for White.\")\n    print(f\"FEN: {fen}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Initial Position Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"White's key asset is the far-advanced passed pawn on d6.\")\n    print(\"However, this pawn is currently blocked by Black's pawn on d7.\")\n    print(\"Black's queen on c5 is extremely active and controls important squares, posing a threat to White.\")\n    print(\"White is down one pawn, so the position is dangerous and requires precise play.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Evaluating Candidate Move 'Qxc5+' ---\")\n    print(\"One option is to trade queens with 1.
