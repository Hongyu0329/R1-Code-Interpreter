    print("\nAnswer: No, it is a long-standing debate, but the modern consensus is that the second postulate is an essential, independent statement.\n")
    print("Here's the reasoning:\n")
    print("1. The First Postulate (The Principle of Relativity) states that the laws of physics must be the same for all observers in uniform motion.\n")
    print("2. Mathematically, this principle alone (with assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime) leads to two possible self-consistent theories for transforming coordinates between observers:\n")
    print("   a) Galilean Relativity: This is our intuitive, everyday understanding. It has no universal speed limit. It implies the equation for velocity addition is: v_total = v1 + v2.\n")
    print("   b) A theory based on a universal, finite invariant speed. Let's call this speed 'V'.\n")
    print("3. The First Postulate CANNOT distinguish between these two possibilities. It allows for a universe with a universal speed limit, or one without.\n")
    print("4. The Second Postulate is the critical piece of experimental evidence that resolves this ambiguity. It states that the speed of light in a vacuum, 'c', is constant for all observers.\n")
    print("5. This directly selects option (b) and sets the universal invariant speed 'V' to be the speed of light, 'c'.\n")
    print("The final equation for the invariant speed is therefore:\n")
    
    speed_of_light = 299792458  # meters per second

    print("\nConclusion: The second postulate is not superfluous. It's the essential bridge between the abstract Principle of Relativity and the actual physical reality of our universe, establishing the fundamental role of the speed of light.")
