# Step 1: Define economic variables based on the problem's conditions.
# We are given P = MC < AVC < ATC. Let's choose some example values.
q1 = 20  # Output level
P = 30   # Market Price (and Marginal Cost)
AVC = 40 # Average Variable Cost
ATC = 50 # Average Total Cost

# Step 2: Calculate the areas S, T, and H as defined in the problem.
# S represents Total Revenue (TR = P * q1)
S = P * q1

# T represents Total Variable Cost (TVC = AVC * q1)
T = AVC * q1

# H represents Total Cost (TC = ATC * q1)
H = ATC * q1

# Step 3: Calculate the firm's profit or loss.
# Profit/Loss = Total Revenue (S) - Total Cost (H)
profit_or_loss = S - H

# Step 4: Print the result.
# The area representing the firm's profit or loss is S - H.
# A negative result indicates a loss.
