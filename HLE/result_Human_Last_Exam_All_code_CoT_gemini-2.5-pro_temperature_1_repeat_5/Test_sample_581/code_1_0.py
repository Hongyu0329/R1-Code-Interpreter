def solve_cap_set_bound():
    """
    This function explains and provides the best-known lower bound for the size of
    a cap set in dimension 8, based on the provided answer choices.

    The problem asks for the best known lower bound for r_3(8), the size of the largest
    set in (Z/3Z)^8 with no three points on a line.

    The value is not derived from a simple formula but from specific, complex constructions,
    often found by computer search. The "best known" bound changes over time with new research.

    A simple product construction using known exact values gives:
    r_3(8) >= r_3(2) * r_3(6) = 4 * 112 = 448.

    This rules out any option less than 448. From the remaining options,
    historical records show that 496 was the established best-known lower bound
    for a significant period. It was found by extending a cap set from a lower dimension.
