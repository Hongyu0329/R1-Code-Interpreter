    This script identifies and prints key amino acid residues on the human
    voltage-gated calcium channel beta-1 subunit (CaVβ1).

    The residues are categorized into two groups:
    1. Hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit.
    2. Hotspots for fine-tuning the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit.

    Residue numbering is based on the canonical human CaVβ1 isoform (UniProt ID: P54283).
