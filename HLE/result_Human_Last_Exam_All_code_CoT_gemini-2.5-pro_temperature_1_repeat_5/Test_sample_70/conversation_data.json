    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then apply the same principles to the flags of African nations.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag**: The flag of Denmark features a white cross on a solid red background. To maximize its rank when viewed as a matrix, we assign distinct numerical values to the two colors (e.g., Red=1, White=2). The structure of the cross introduces both horizontal and vertical variations that are linearly independent. A matrix representing the flag would have rows corresponding to the red field and the horizontal bar of the cross, which are linearly independent. Thus, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Categorize African Flags by Rank**: We need to find African flags that also have a maximal rank of 2.\n    *   **Rank 1 Flags**: These are flags whose designs consist *only* of simple horizontal stripes or *only* of simple vertical stripes. In these cases, all rows (for horizontal stripes) or all columns (for vertical stripes) are linearly dependent on a single-row/column basis, resulting in a rank of 1.\n    *   **Rank 2 Flags**: These are flags with more complex designs. Any feature that breaks the simple one-dimensional striped pattern will introduce a second linearly independent component, resulting in a maximal rank of 2. Such features include:\n        *   A combination of vertical and horizontal elements (bars, stripes).\n        *   A cross or a diagonal stripe/division.\n        *   A triangular section at the hoist.\n        *   A canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner).\n        *   An emblem, symbol, or star placed on the flag (this creates a variation in both rows and columns that isn't dependent on the stripe pattern alone).\n\n3.  **Implement in Python**: The Python code will first define the set of all 54 African nations. It will then identify the small subset of nations whose flags have a simple, purely striped design (Rank 1). The remaining nations must therefore have flags with a rank of 2, the same as Denmark. The code will then print this final list.\n\n```python\ndef find_flags_with_same_rank_as_denmark():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies African national flags with the same linear algebraic rank as Denmark's flag.\n    Rank(Denmark) = 2.\n    Flags with Rank = 1 are simple horizontal or vertical stripes only.\n    Flags with Rank = 2 have any other feature (emblems, crosses, diagonals, triangles, cantons, etc.).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    all_african_nations = {\n        \"Algeria\", \"Angola\", \"Benin\", \"Botswana\", \"Burkina Faso\", \"Burundi\", \"Cabo Verde\",\n        \"Cameroon\", \"Central African Republic\", \"Chad\", \"Comoros\", \"Cote d'Ivoire\",\n        \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"Djibouti\", \"Egypt\", \"Equatorial Guinea\",\n        \"Eritrea\", \"Eswatini\", \"Ethiopia\", \"Gabon\", \"Gambia\", \"Ghana\", \"Guinea\",\n        \"Guinea-Bissau\", \"Kenya\", \"Lesotho\", \"Liberia\", \"Libya\", \"Madagascar\", \"Malawi\",\n        \"Mali\", \"Mauritania\", \"Mauritius\", \"Morocco\", \"Mozambique\", \"Namibia\", \"Niger\",\n        \"Nigeria\", \"Republic of the Congo\", \"Rwanda\", \"Sao Tome and Principe\", \"Senegal\",\n        \"Seychelles\", \"Sierra Leone\", \"Somalia\", \"South Africa\", \"South Sudan\", \"Sudan\",\n        \"Tanzania\", \"Togo\", \"Tunisia\", \"Uganda\", \"Zambia\", \"Zimbabwe\"\n    }\n\n    # Nations with simple, purely striped flags (Rank 1)\n    rank_1_nations = {\n        \"Botswana\",          # Purely horizontal stripes\n        \"Chad\",              # Purely vertical stripes\n        \"Cote d'Ivoire\",     # Purely vertical stripes\n        \"Gabon\",             # Purely horizontal stripes\n        \"Gambia\",            # Purely horizontal stripes\n        \"Guinea\",            # Purely vertical stripes\n        \"Mali\",              # Purely vertical stripes\n        \"Mauritius\",         # Purely horizontal stripes\n        \"Nigeria\",           # Purely vertical stripes\n        \"Sierra Leone\",      # Purely horizontal stripes\n    }\n\n    # Nations with flags of Rank 2 are all nations minus the Rank 1 nations.\n    rank_2_nations = sorted(list(all_african_nations - rank_1_nations))\n\n    # The Danish flag has a rank of 2.
