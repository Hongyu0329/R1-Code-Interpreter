# The user is asking to identify the person "HE" based on several clues.
# 1. The reference to "Veronika Campan's interpretation" points towards a figure in philosophy or psychoanalysis, as she is a scholar in this field.
# 2. The phrase "another's material possessions" is a clear reference to the last of the Ten Commandments, which forbids coveting.
# 3. The phrase "prohibition against representation" refers to the Second Commandment, which forbids making graven images.
# 4. The specific intellectual analysis that links the commandment against representation (images) with the commandment against coveting (desire) is a well-known part of the work of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, particularly in his Seminar VII, "The Ethics of Psychoanalysis".
# 5. Given that Veronika Campan is an interpreter of his work, "HE" is Jacques Lacan.
