    "Of course. Here is my analysis and the code to provide the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the User's Request:** The user is asking for a specific Beatles song identified by a unique opening chord change: from the tonic chord to a \"minor fifth chord\".\n2.  **Interpret Music Theory:**\n    *   The \"tonic\" is the main chord of the key, also known as the \"I\" chord.\n    *   A \"minor fifth chord\" is a slightly ambiguous term. The most likely interpretation in this context is a *minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale*. In Roman numeral analysis, this is the \"v\" chord (a minor five). This is a distinct sound, different from the more common major V chord.\n3.  **Identify the Song:** I'll search through my knowledge of The Beatles' discography for songs that use this I -> v progression. The song \"I'll Be Back\" from the album \"A Hard Day's Night\" is a prime example.\n    *   The song is in the key of A major.\n    *   The tonic (I) chord is **A major**.\n    *   The fifth degree of the A major scale is E. A minor chord on this degree (v) is **E minor**.\n    *   The song prominently features the progression **A major -> E minor**.\n    *   It is important to note that while this progression is a key feature, the song technically *starts* with a different but related major-to-minor shift: A major to A minor. The user is likely remembering the most distinct harmonic feature of the song.\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will create a Python script that stores the song title and the musical analysis in variables. The script will then print out the answer and a clear explanation of the chord progression, fulfilling the user's request. To satisfy the prompt's requirement of outputting an \"equation\", I will represent the chord progression using Roman numerals.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a specific chord progression\n    and prints the analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Song and key information\n    song_title = \"I'll Be Back\"\n    album = \"A Hard Day's Night\"\n    key = \"A Major\"\n    \n    # Analysis of the chord progression described\n    tonic_chord_name = \"A Major\"\n    tonic_chord_numeral = \"I\"\n    \n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"E minor\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_numeral = \"v\"\n    \n    # Print the final answer and explanation\n    print(f\"The Beatles song you're looking for is: '{song_title}' from the album '{album}'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis of the Chord Progression ---\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(f\"The 'tonic' chord is {tonic_chord_name} ({tonic_chord_numeral}).\")\n    print(f\"The 'minor fifth chord' is {minor_fifth_chord_name} ({minor_fifth_chord_numeral}).\")\n    \n    # As requested, here is the progression represented as an \"equation\"\n    print(\"\\nThe final progression is:\")\n    print(f\"{tonic_chord_numeral} -> {minor_fifth_chord_numeral}\")\n    print(f\"({tonic_chord_name} -> {minor_fifth_chord_name})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nNote: While this progression is a key feature of the song, the intro famously begins with a different major-to-minor shift (A Major to A minor).\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
