    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Mathematical Functions:** First, we need to represent the given supply `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions in our code.\n\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** Market equilibrium occurs where the supply price equals the demand price (`P_S = P_D`). This also means the quantities are equal (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_e`). We will find the equilibrium quantity `Q_e` by solving the equation `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` for `Q`. This equation is complex and requires a numerical solver. Once we find `Q_e`, we can calculate the equilibrium price `P_e` by substituting `Q_e` back into either the supply or demand function.\n\n3.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** Consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price. It is calculated by the definite integral of the demand function from 0 to `Q_e`, minus the revenue rectangle (`P_e * Q_e`).\n    `CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - P_e * Q_e`\n\n4.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. It is calculated as the revenue rectangle (`P_e * Q_e`) minus the definite integral of the supply function. Note that the supply function is only defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, or `Q > ∛2`. So, the integration for the supply curve starts from `∛2`.\n    `PS = P_e * Q_e - ∫[∛2 to Q_e] ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ`\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus (`TW = CS + PS`). This simplifies to the area between the demand and supply curves.\n    `TW = ∫[0 to Q_e] (Demand) dQ - ∫[∛2 to Q_e] (Supply) dQ`\n\n6.  **Implementation:** We will use the `scipy` library for numerical calculations:\n    *   `scipy.optimize.root_scalar` to find the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`.\n    *   `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the definite integrals for the surplus calculations.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the total welfare.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# --- 1.
