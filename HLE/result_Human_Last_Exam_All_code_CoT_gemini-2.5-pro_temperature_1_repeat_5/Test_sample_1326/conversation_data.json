    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the integral:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Integral**: The function $p(x)$ is a piecewise function with a split at $x=3$. Therefore, to find the integral from $x=0$ to $x=4$, we must split the integral into two separate parts: one from $x=0$ to $x=3$ and another from $x=3$ to $x=4$.\n    \n    The total integral is: $\\int_0^4 p(x) dx = \\int_0^3 \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx + \\int_3^4 \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx$\n\n2.  **Solving the First Integral**: The first part is the integral of $\\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$. This is a simple polynomial integral.\n    \n    $\\int_0^3 \\frac{x^3}{4} dx = \\left[\\frac{x^4}{16}\\right]_0^3 = \\frac{3^4}{16} - \\frac{0^4}{16} = \\frac{81}{16}$\n\n3.  **Solving the Second Integral**: The second part is more complex. We can simplify the integrand $\\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x}$ using the trigonometric identities $\\sin x = 2\\sin(x/2)\\cos(x/2)$ and $1+\\cos x = 2\\cos^2(x/2)$. The integrand simplifies to $e^x(\\tan(x/2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(x/2))$, which is in the form $e^x(f(x) + f'(x))$ with $f(x) = \\tan(x/2)$. The antiderivative is $e^x \\tan(x/2)$.\n    \n    $\\int_3^4 \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx = \\left[e^x \\tan(x/2)\\right]_3^4 = e^4\\tan(2) - e^3\\tan(1.5)$\n\n4.  **Summation and Final Calculation**: The total integral is the sum of the results from the two parts. I will use a Python script to compute the numerical values and sum them up. The script will print out the values for each part of the integral and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The integral is split into two parts at x=3.\n\n# Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3\n# The integral of (2*x^3)/8 is x^4/16.\n# Evaluating from 0 to 3 gives (3^4)/16 - 0.\nintegral_part1 = 81.0 / 16.0\n\n# Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4\n# The antiderivative of e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x)) is e^x * tan(x/2).\n# We evaluate this from 3 to 4. Note that numpy's trigonometric functions use radians.\nval_at_4 = np.exp(4) * np.tan(2)\nval_at_3 = np.exp(3) * np.tan(1.5)\nintegral_part2 = val_at_4 - val_at_3\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts.\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\nprint(\"The total integral is the sum of two parts:\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 0 to 3: ∫(2x^3/8)dx = (3^4)/16 = {integral_part1}\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 3 to 4: ∫(e^x(1+sin(x))/(1+cos(x)))dx = [e^x * tan(x/2)]_3^4 = ({val_at_4:.4f}) - ({val_at_3:.4f}) = {integral_part2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {integral_part1} + ({integral_part2:.4f}) = {total_integral:.4f}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.4661>>>"
