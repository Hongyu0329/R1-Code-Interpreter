    # Part (a): True or False: In the doubling construction, each element of Q x {0, 1}
    # is contained in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.
    # Interpretation: An "ND-pair" is a pair of points with different first and second coordinates,
    # i.e., of the form {(x, i), (y, 1-i)} where x is not equal to y.
    # Let's check for an arbitrary element, for instance (z, 0) from Q x {0, 1}.
    # The ND-pairs containing (z, 0) must be of the form {(z, 0), (y, 1)} where y is in Q and y != z.
    # There are v-1 such choices for y. Therefore, any element is contained in exactly v-1 such pairs.
    # The statement is True under this interpretation.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} in the resulting
    # nested SQS(2v) if the pair {x, y} had multiplicity mu in the original SQS(v)?
    # Interpretation: "Multiplicity mu" of a pair {x,y} in the nested SQS(v) is the number of
    # blocks containing {x,y} within a specific component of the nesting, say B_i. So, mu = lambda_i({x,y}).
    # The doubling construction has two types of blocks: Type A (derived from original blocks) and Type B (new blocks).
    # For each block in B_i containing {x,y}, the construction creates two Type A blocks containing {(x,0),(y,0)}.
    # For example, from {x,y,z,w}, we get {(x,0),(y,0),(z,0),(w,0)} and {(x,0),(y,0),(z,1),(w,1)}.
    # If we assume the new nesting has components B'_i derived from B_i's Type A blocks,
    # the multiplicity of {(x,0),(y,0)} in B'_i will be twice the original.
    # The equation is: new_multiplicity = 2 * mu.
    number_in_equation = 2
    answer_b = f"{number_in_equation}*mu"

    # Part (c): Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v in the constructed nested SQS(2v)?
    # Interpretation: "Multiplicity" is the number of blocks a pair appears in within a single nesting component (lambda_j).
    # The total number of blocks containing any given pair in an SQS(2v) is r = ((2v) - 2) / 2 = v - 1.
    # The sum of multiplicities over all nesting components for a pair P must equal this total: Sum(lambda_j(P)) = v - 1.
    # Since each lambda_j(P) is a non-negative integer, it must be that lambda_j(P) <= v - 1.
    # Therefore, a multiplicity of exactly v is impossible.
    answer_c = "No"

    # Combine the answers into the final format.
