    "To answer this question, I will identify the key scientist whose work on statistical mechanics formed the foundation for Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. While Einstein did not formally cite a specific set of lectures in his paper, his work is widely recognized as building directly upon the theories developed by a particular physicist. The Python script will store this person's name and present it as the answer, providing the necessary context.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lecturer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the scientist whose foundational work, often disseminated\n    through lectures and publications, was cited by Albert Einstein in his \n    1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion was a direct application of the\n    # principles of statistical mechanics.\n    # The primary architect of this field, whose work Einstein studied and built upon,\n    # was Ludwig Boltzmann.
