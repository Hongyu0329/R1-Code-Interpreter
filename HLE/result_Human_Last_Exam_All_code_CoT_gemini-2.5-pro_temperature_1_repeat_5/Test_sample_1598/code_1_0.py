# The problem reduces to finding the maximum label k in a set of 100 labels
# {w_1, w_2, ..., w_100} where each label w_i cannot be expressed as a
# sum of any subset of the other 99 labels.
# A greedy approach to minimize the maximum label is to build the set of
# labels {w_1, w_2, ...} in increasing order, choosing the smallest possible
# integer at each step.
# w_1 = 1
# w_2 must be > w_1 and not equal to w_1. Smallest choice is 2.
# w_3 must be > w_2 and not in {w_1, w_2, w_1+w_2} = {1, 2, 3}. Smallest choice is 4.
# This leads to a sequence of powers of 2: w_i = 2^(i-1).
# For 100 labels, the set is {2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^99}.
# The global labeling number is the maximum label in this set.

base = 2

# Calculate the result

# Print the equation and the result
print(f"The global labeling number of K_1,100 is the 100th term in the sequence.")
