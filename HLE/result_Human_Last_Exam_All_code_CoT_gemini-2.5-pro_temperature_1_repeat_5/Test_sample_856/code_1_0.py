# The question is a theoretical one, but the user requested code.
# The core of the problem is the number 10!, so we will calculate it.
n = 10
n_factorial = math.factorial(n)

# The reasoning outlined above leads to the conclusion that no such manifolds exist.
# The number of manifolds is 0.
# The final output should be an equation. We will state the result as a simple equation.
num_manifolds = 0

# Print the value of 10! for context.

# Print the final equation as requested.
# We output each number in the final equation.
