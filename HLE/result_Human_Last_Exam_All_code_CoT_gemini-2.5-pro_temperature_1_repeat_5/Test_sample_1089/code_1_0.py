    # in order to restore the component's original geometry.

    print("Evaluating damage types:")
    # A. Stress Corrosion Cracking & E. Fatigue Cracking:
    # While welding can repair cracks, the term 'build-up of layers' is more descriptive of restoring a worn surface than filling a narrow crack.
    print("A & E (Cracking): Less likely. Repairing cracks is typically 'weld filling', not a 'build-up of layers'.")

    # B. Foreign Object Damage (FOD):
    # This causes nicks and gouges. Weld repair fills these voids. This is a form of build-up.
    print("B (FOD): Plausible. Welding is used to fill in material lost from impacts.")

    # C. Blade Tip Rub and Wear:
    # This is the progressive loss of material from the blade tip due to friction with the engine casing.
    # Restoring the precise length of the blade tip by adding layers of weld material is a standard, critical repair procedure to maintain engine efficiency.
    # This perfectly matches the description 'build-up of layers'.
    print("C (Blade Tip Rub and Wear): Very strong match. This process directly restores the blade tip's geometry by adding layers of material.")

    # D. Creep Deformation:
    # Creep is the slow stretching of the entire blade under heat and stress. Welding cannot reverse this bulk deformation.
    print("D (Creep): Incorrect. Welding is a localized process and cannot fix blade stretching.")

    # F. High-Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion:
    # This is general surface degradation, often addressed with protective coatings.
    print("F (Oxidation/Corrosion): Less likely. This is typically addressed by re-coating, not heavy weld build-up unless the damage is severe and localized.")

    print("-" * 40)
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The most common and direct application for building up layers of weld material is to restore material lost from wear. Blade tip rub is the classic example of this.")
