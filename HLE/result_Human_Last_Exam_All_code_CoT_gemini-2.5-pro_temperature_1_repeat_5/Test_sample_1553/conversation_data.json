    "I will answer the user's question by providing a Python script.\nThe user is asking for the name of a character from a novel. This information is a fact that I have access to. My plan is to create a simple Python script that stores this name in a variable and then prints it to the console, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based answer.\n\n```python\n# The main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# This script will print the name of the character he marries during the course of the novel.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Angelika\"\nprint(character_name)\n```\n<<<Angelika>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the name of the character that the main character of Jacek Duke's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonalość\" marries?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
