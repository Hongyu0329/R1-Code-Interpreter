    "An FGH-tripled fixed point, as you've described it, involves three functions. However, your prompt lists `F`, `G`, and then `G` again with a different signature. I will assume this is intentional, meaning the function `G` is defined differently depending on the type of its input arguments.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the conditions:\n1.  **Define the System:** First, I will clearly state the definitions of the three functions and what a \"tripled fixed point\" means in this specific context, based on your prompt.\n2.  **Establish the Foundation:** The existence of such a fixed point relies on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. This requires the underlying sets (X, Y, Z) to be complete metric spaces. I will state this as the first condition.\n3.  **Introduce Contraction:** The core of the theorem is that the functions must be \"contractions,\" meaning they shrink distances between points. I will formulate a specific contraction inequality for each of the three function definitions. These inequalities will involve a set of constant coefficients (e.g., `a1, b1, c1, ...`).\n4.  **Derive the Final Conditions:** By combining the individual contraction inequalities, I will derive the final set of conditions that the coefficients must satisfy. These conditions ensure that the overall system of functions shrinks distances in the combined space `X*Y*Z`, guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of the tripled fixed point.\n5.  **Present in Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that uses `print()` statements to clearly present all these definitions and conditions, including the final equations with their numeric components.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and prints the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point\n    based on the user's function definitions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction and Problem Definition ---\n    print(\"This script outlines the conditions for a set of functions to have a tripled fixed point.\")\n    print(\"Based on your query, we have the following functions:\")\n    print(\"1.
