    # and "discretizes" F. This can be interpreted as F being constructed from a
    # representation G on I, i.e., F = f^k(G).
    # This implies that the projective dimension of F is less than or equal to the global
    # dimension of the category of representations on I.
    # To satisfy the conditions for any such F, we can consider the simplest poset I that
    # can produce non-projective representations (e.g., a poset corresponding to a single
    # arrow). The global dimension for such a category is 1.
