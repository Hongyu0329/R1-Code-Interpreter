    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to find the pattern in the sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial sequence:** The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\n2.  **Look for a simple relationship:** Let's test a relationship of the form `next_number = constant * current_number + something`. A common constant to test is 2.\n    *   To get from 2 to 11: `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`\n    *   To get from 11 to 23: `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n    *   To get from 23 to 51: `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n    *   To get from 51 to 119: `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n\n3.  **Identify the primary pattern:** The primary pattern is `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + k_n`, where `x_n` is the n-th term in the sequence. The values of `k` form a new sequence: 7, 1, 5, 17.\n\n4.  **Analyze the new sequence `k`:** The sequence `k` is [7, 1, 5, 17]. We need to find the pattern within this sequence to predict the next term. Let's see if there's a relationship of the form `next_k = constant * current_k + something`.\n    *   The first term is 7. Let's see if the pattern starts from the second term, 1.\n    *   To get from 1 to 5: `5 = 3 * 1 + 2`.\n    *   To get from 5 to 17: `17 = 3 * 5 + 2`.\n\n5.  **Identify the secondary pattern:** The pattern for the `k` sequence (starting from its second term) is `k_new = 3 * k_current + 2`. The first term, 7, is an exception to this rule.\n\n6.  **Calculate the next term in the `k` sequence:** Using the pattern `k_new = 3 * k_current + 2`, we can find the next term after 17.\n    *   `next_k = 3 * 17 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final missing number:** Now we use the primary pattern `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + k_n` with the next `k` value we just found.\n    *   The last known number in the main sequence is 119.\n    *   The next number is `2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The missing number in the sequence is 291. This matches option A.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by finding the underlying patterns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    s = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\")\n    print(\"Let's test the pattern: next_number = 2 * current_number + k\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate the sequence of k\n    k = []\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1):\n        k_val = s[i+1] - 2 * s[i]\n        k.append(k_val)\n        print(f\"{s[i+1]} = 2 * {s[i]} + {k_val}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The sequence of k is: {k}\")\n    print(\"Let's find the pattern in the k sequence [7, 1, 5, 17], ignoring the first term.\")\n    print(\"The pattern seems to be: next_k = 3 * current_k + 2\")\n\n    # Verify the pattern for k\n    print(\"Verifying the pattern for k:\")\n    print(f\"{k[2]} = 3 * {k[1]} + 2  =>  5 = 3 * 1 + 2.
