    This function calculates and prints the order type based on the problem description.
    
    The problem asks for the order type of the set X of possible cofinalities
    of the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers, given certain conditions.
    
    1. Let kappa = 2^omega. We are given that kappa is a singular cardinal, so cf(kappa) < kappa.
    2. We are given kappa < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    3. By Konig's Theorem, cf(kappa) > omega. So cf(kappa) is an uncountable regular cardinal.
    4. Let mu = cf(kappa). The set X consists of all possible values for mu.
    5. The conditions imply that X is the set of all uncountable regular cardinals mu such that mu < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    6. A deeper analysis shows that this is equivalent to the set of uncountable regular cardinals mu < omega_{omega+5}.
    7. Let gamma = omega_{omega+5}. The set is {mu | mu is an uncountable regular cardinal and mu < gamma}.
    8. The order type of this set of cardinals is gamma. This is because the set of successor cardinals less than gamma, {aleph_{alpha+1} | aleph_{alpha+1} < gamma}, is cofinal in gamma and its set of indices has order type gamma.
    
    The final order type is the ordinal omega_{omega+5}.

    # The number present in the final expression for the order type.
    number_in_expression = 5
    
    # We represent the ordinal omega with the letter 'w' for clarity in the output string.
    print(f"The order type of X is omega_(omega+{number_in_expression})")
