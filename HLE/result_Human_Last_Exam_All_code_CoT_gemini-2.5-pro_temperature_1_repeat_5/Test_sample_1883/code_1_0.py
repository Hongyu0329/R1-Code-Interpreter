print("Two competing conrotatory pathways exist, one leading to the cis-isomer (A) and one to the trans-isomer (B).")
print("Analysis of the transition states reveals that the pathway to the trans-isomer (B) has significantly less steric strain.")
print("Therefore, the trans-isomer (B) is the major product, and the cis-isomer (A) is the minor product.")
