# The solution is derived by logically piecing together the clues.
# Let's represent the five positions in the sequence with underscores: [_, _, _, _, _]

# 1. "Number 1 is the first...": The sequence starts with 1.
# Sequence: [1, _, _, _, _]
num1 = 1

# 2. "...the fifth, who ... lastly follows.": The sequence ends with the 5th number.
# The numbers involved are 1, 2, 3, 4, and a fifth one, logically 5.
# Sequence: [1, _, _, _, 5]
num5 = 5

# 3. "Number three ... protects the last;": Number 3 is in the position just before the last one.
# Sequence: [1, _, _, 3, 5]
num4 = 3 # This is the fourth number in the sequence

# 4. "Number 4 likes two the most and it always goes behind.": This means we have a block of '2, 4'.
# This block must fit in the remaining empty slots.
# Sequence: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
num2 = 2 # This is the second number in the sequence
num3 = 4 # This is the third number in the sequence

# The final sequence is 1, 2, 4, 3, 5.
# The following code prints each number of this final sequence.
print("The numbers in the correct order are:")
print(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
