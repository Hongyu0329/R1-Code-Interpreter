    "Of course, I can help with that. My plan is to first identify the specific movie that matches the detailed scene you've described. The key elements are a Hollywood film from a major studio, a teenager, a distinct pink bike, and the act of pedaling directly toward an oncoming car. Based on these details, the film is \"Angus\" (1995). I will then provide a Python script that prints this title as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking to identify a specific movie scene.\n#\n# Film: Angus (1995)\n# Studio: New Line Cinema (a major studio)\n# Scene Description: The main character's best friend, Troy, is being bullied by Rick.\n# To prove he isn't scared, Troy, who is riding a pink girl's Huffy bicycle,\n# pedals directly at Rick's oncoming car. Rick swerves at the last second to avoid a collision.\n#\n# This script will print the title of the movie.\n\nmovie_title = \"Angus\"\nprint(movie_title)\n```\n<<<Angus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
