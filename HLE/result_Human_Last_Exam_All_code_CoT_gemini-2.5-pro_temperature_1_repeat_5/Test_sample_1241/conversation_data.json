    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stationary probabilities of the system, which are the values of $P_i(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. Let's denote these stationary probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nAt steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their derivatives with respect to time are zero. This transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n### My plan is as follows:\n1.  **Set up the system of linear equations:** By setting $P_i'(t) = 0$, we get a system of equations for $p_i$.\n    *   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n2.  **Add the normalization condition:** The sum of all probabilities must be 1.\n    *   $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n3.  **Solve the system:** The sum of the first four equations is $0=0$, which means one equation is redundant. We can form a solvable system using three independent equations from the original set and the normalization condition.\n4.  **Represent as a matrix equation:** I will represent this system in the form of a matrix equation, `Ax = b`, where `x` is the vector of unknown probabilities $[p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3]^T$.\n5.  **Code the solution:** I will use Python with the `numpy` library to define the matrix `A` and vector `b`, and then solve for `x`.\n6.  **Calculate the final result:** Once the values of $p_0$ and $p_1$ are found, I will calculate their sum, $p_0 + p_1$. The code will print out each step of the calculation, including the individual probabilities and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given lambda values\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), P_i'(t) = 0.\n# We get a system of linear equations for the stationary probabilities p_i.\n# We choose three independent equations from the system and the normalization equation.\n# -l_01*p0 + l_10*p1 = 0\n# l_12*p1 - (l_21+l_23)*p2 = 0\n# l_23*p2 - l_31*p3 = 0\n# p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n\n# This can be written in matrix form Ax = b\n# where x = [p0, p1, p2, p3]^T\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations for p = [p0, p1, p2, p3]\ntry:\n    p = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    p0, p1, p2, p3 = p[0], p[1], p[2], p[3]\n\n    # Calculate the required sum\n    result = p0 + p1\n    \n    # Print the results\n    print(\"The system of linear equations is:\")\n    print(f\"{-lambda_01}*p0 + {lambda_10}*p1 = 0\")\n    print(f\"{lambda_12}*p1 - {lambda_21 + lambda_23}*p2 = 0\")\n    print(f\"{lambda_23}*p2 - {lambda_31}*p3 = 0\")\n    print(\"p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Solving this system gives the stationary probabilities:\")\n    print(f\"P0(inf) = {p0:.7f}\")\n    print(f\"P1(inf) = {p1:.7f}\")\n    print(f\"P2(inf) = {p2:.7f}\")\n    print(f\"P3(inf) = {p3:.7f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The required sum is:\")\n    # Final output of the equation with the numbers plugged in\n    print(f\"P0(inf) + P1(inf) = {p0:.7f} + {p1:.7f} = {result:.7f}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations is singular and cannot be solved.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462518>>>"
