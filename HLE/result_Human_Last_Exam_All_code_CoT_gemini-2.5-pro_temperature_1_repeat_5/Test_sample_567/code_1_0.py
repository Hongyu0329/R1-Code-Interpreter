# The value 'a' where the volume constraint becomes the only obstruction
# is given by tau^4, where tau is the golden ratio.
# The exact algebraic expression for tau^4 is (7 + 3*sqrt(5))/2.
# We will now calculate this value.

seven = 7
three = 3
five = 5
two = 2

# Calculate the square root of 5
sqrt_five = math.sqrt(five)

# Calculate the numerator of the expression
numerator = seven + three * sqrt_five

# Calculate the final value of 'a'
a = numerator / two

# The problem requires outputting each number in the final equation.
# The equation is: a = (7 + 3 * sqrt(5)) / 2
