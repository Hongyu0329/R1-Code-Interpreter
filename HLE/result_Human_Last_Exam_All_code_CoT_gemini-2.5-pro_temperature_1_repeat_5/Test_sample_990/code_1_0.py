# The problem asks for the time it takes a raindrop to fall a certain height
# while it accumulates mass from atmospheric micro-droplets.

# Based on the physics of the system (as described in the plan), the
# acceleration of the raindrop is found to be constant.
# The derivation yields:
# a = g / 7
# where 'g' is the acceleration due to gravity.

# For an object falling from rest over a distance 'h' with constant acceleration 'a',
# the time 't' can be found using the kinematic equation: h = (1/2)*a*t^2.
# Solving for t, we get: t = sqrt(2 * h / a).

# We can now substitute the derived acceleration a = g/7 into this equation:
# t = sqrt(2 * h / (g / 7))
# t = sqrt(14 * h / g)
# Note that this expression for time is independent of the densities rho and Rho.

# The problem states that the initial height is h = 350g meters.
h_numerical_value = 350

# We substitute this value of h into our equation for time.
# t = sqrt(14 * (350 * g) / g)
# The 'g' in the numerator and denominator cancels out.
final_calculation_term = 14 * h_numerical_value
time = math.sqrt(final_calculation_term)
