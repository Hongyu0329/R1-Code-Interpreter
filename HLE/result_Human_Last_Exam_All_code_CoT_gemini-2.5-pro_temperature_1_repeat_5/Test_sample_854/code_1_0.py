print("The laboratory's mistake was in trusting the evidence from a flawed QC test.")
print("They misinterpreted the 'no growth' result as proof that the antibiotic in Batch 3 was working.")
print("In reality, the 'no growth' was most likely due to a non-viable QC bacterial culture. This meant the QC test was invalid and failed to detect the inactivated antibiotic in Batch 3.")
