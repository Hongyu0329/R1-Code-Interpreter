    The reaction is the thermal syn-elimination (pyrolysis) of a sulfoxide.
    Starting Material: ((2-((2-methylbut-3-en-2-yl)oxy)ethyl)sulfinyl)benzene
    Structure: Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2
    
    The elimination of Ph-SOH forms a double bond between the alpha and beta carbons.
    Product Structure: CH2=CH-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2
    
    IUPAC Naming of the Product:
    1. It's an ether. The parent chain is the more complex alkenyl group.
       - Group 1: ethenyl (2 carbons)
       - Group 2: -C(CH3)2-CH=CH2. The parent hydrocarbon for this group is 3-methylbut-1-ene.
         The point of attachment is at carbon 3.
    2. The parent chain is therefore based on '3-methylbut-1-ene'.
    3. The other group, 'ethenyl' + 'oxy', becomes the substituent 'ethenyloxy'.
    4. The 'ethenyloxy' group is attached to carbon 3 of the parent chain.
    5. Combining these parts gives the final name.
