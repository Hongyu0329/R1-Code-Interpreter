    # Patient's key features:
    # 1. Phenotype: Amenorrhea, infertility, ovarian dysgenesis, short stature, exercise intolerance.
    #    This presentation has significant overlap with Turner Syndrome.
    # 2. Karyotype: Normal 46,XX. This rules out classic Turner Syndrome (45,X).
    # 3. Synthesis: The combination of Turner-like features with a normal karyotype
    #    is characteristic of Noonan Syndrome. Noonan Syndrome is a genetic disorder
    #    that can cause short stature, heart defects (explaining exercise intolerance),
    #    and gonadal issues like ovarian dysgenesis.
    # 4. Molecular Basis: The most common cause of Noonan Syndrome is a mutation in a
    #    specific gene.
