    This script analyzes different strategies for fitting a birth-death model

    explanation = """
The core issue with fitting a birth-death model with time-varying speciation λ(t) and extinction μ(t) on a phylogeny of only extant species is that the model is unidentifiable. This means that different λ(t) and μ(t) functions can produce the exact same likelihood, making it impossible to disentangle them. A helpful strategy must either add new information or appropriately constrain the model.

Here is an analysis of the provided options:

A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces: This strategy simplifies (regularizes) the model by reducing its flexibility. Regularization is a standard approach to make inference more stable for ill-posed problems. This is a helpful step.

B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework: Priors add external information, which constrains the possible parameter values and helps identify a unique solution from the posterior distribution. This is a very effective strategy.

C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5: This strategy dramatically increases the model's complexity and number of parameters. Such high flexibility worsens the identifiability problem, as it creates an even larger set of parameter combinations that can perfectly fit the data. This does NOT help mitigate the issue; it exacerbates it.

D. & F. Incorporating fossils: Fossils provide direct evidence of extinct lineages. This powerful, additional data breaks the ambiguity between speciation and extinction, allowing λ(t) and μ(t) to be identified separately. This is a very helpful strategy.

E. & G. Reparametrizing the model: The pulled diversification rate and pulled speciation rate are parameter combinations that are known to be identifiable from extant-only phylogenies. Focusing inference on these identifiable parameters is a mathematically sound way to circumvent the problem. This is a helpful strategy.

Therefore, the only strategy that does not help, and in fact worsens the problem, is increasing the model's complexity unnecessarily.
