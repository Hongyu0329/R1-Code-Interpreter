    "Answering this question requires understanding the topological properties of the toric code. The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the number of independent logical qubits, which in turn depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined.\n\n### Step-by-step Deriviation:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The system is the 2D toric code defined on a surface with `n` smooth boundaries (holes) and `m` rough boundaries (holes). The GSD is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits.\n\n2.  **Role of Boundaries:**\n    *   A **smooth boundary** (also called an electric or e-type boundary) is where `B_p` plaquette operators are truncated. It acts as a sink for magnetic (`m`) anyons. Logical `X` operators (which create `m` anyons) can terminate on smooth boundaries.\n    *   A **rough boundary** (also called a magnetic or m-type boundary) is where `A_s` star operators are truncated. It acts as a sink for electric (`e`) anyons. Logical `Z` operators (which create `e` anyons) can terminate on rough boundaries.\n\n3.  **Determine the Topology:** The term \"holes\" suggests boundaries created by puncturing a 2D manifold. There's a crucial ambiguity here: is the manifold a compact surface like a sphere, or a non-compact one like an infinite plane?\n    *   **On a sphere:** If we puncture a sphere `b = n+m` times, the number of independent, non-trivial loops is `b-1`. This is because a loop around any one hole is topologically equivalent to the combination of loops around all other holes. This leads to `k = n+m-1` logical qubits, and a GSD of `2^(n+m-1)`. This is not among the answer choices.\n    *   **On an infinite plane:** If we puncture an infinite plane `b = n+m` times, there is no \"outer boundary\" or constraint at infinity. A loop around each hole is an independent topological feature. This gives `b = n+m` independent loops.\n\n4.  **Count the Logical Qubits (for the infinite plane case):** The answer choices suggest the infinite plane model is the intended one. In this case, we can associate one logical qubit with each hole.\n    *   For each of the **`n` smooth holes**, we can define a logical qubit:\n        *   A logical `Z_L` operator is a `Z`-string that loops around the hole.\n        *   A logical `X_L` operator is an `X`-string that runs from the hole to infinity.\n        *   These two operators anti-commute, forming a valid qubit.\n    *   For each of the **`m` rough holes**, we can define a logical qubit:\n        *   A logical `X_L` operator is an `X`-string that loops around the hole.\n        *   A logical `Z_L` operator is a `Z`-string that runs from the hole to infinity.\n        *   These two operators also anti-commute, forming a valid qubit.\n\n    Since we can define one such qubit for each of the `n+m` holes, and these qubits can be constructed to be independent of each other on an infinite plane, the total number of logical qubits is `k = n+m`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Degeneracy:** With `k = n+m` logical qubits, the ground space degeneracy is `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`. This matches option A.\n\nThe following Python code prints the resulting formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_degeneracy():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the ground space degeneracy of the toric code\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of logical qubits 'k' is the sum of the number of smooth holes 'n'\n    # and rough holes 'm', assuming the system is on an infinite plane.\n    # k = n + m\n    \n    # The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k.\n    # GSD = 2^(n + m)\n    \n    # The final equation is GSD = 2^(m+n)\n    base = 2\n    \n    print(\"The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"GSD = base^(n + m)\")\n    print(f\"Where the base is {base}, 'n' is the number of smooth holes, and 'm' is the number of rough holes.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # As requested, printing the 'numbers' in the equation. The base is 2.\n    print(f\"GSD = {base}^(m + n)\")\n\nsolve_degeneracy()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
