    "Of course. I can explain the functional dependence and provide a Python script to demonstrate it.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Explain the Concept:** I will first explain what the bare Green's function ($G_0$) represents in the context of the Feynman path integral formalism.\n2.  **State the Formula:** I will provide the standard formula for the bare Green's function in the frequency-momentum domain, which explicitly shows its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ($\\epsilon_k$).\n3.  **Detail the Components:** I will break down each term in the formula ($\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$, and the infinitesimal $i\\delta$) to clarify its physical meaning.\n4.  **Provide Python Code:** I will write a Python script that calculates a numerical value for $G_0$ using specific values for the parameters. The script will print out the full equation with the numbers used, demonstrating the calculation clearly as requested.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the **bare Green's function**, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle from one point in spacetime to another. When we analyze this in energy-momentum space (by performing a Fourier transform), we get the Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$, which depends on momentum $k$ and frequency (energy) $\\omega$.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$, is given by the following relation:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta_{k}}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms:\n*   $\\mathbf{\\omega}$: This is the frequency (or energy) variable for the propagating particle.\n*   $\\mathbf{\\epsilon_k}$: This is the **single-particle energy eigenvalue** for a state with momentum (or quantum number) $k$. This is the energy the particle would have if it were in a stationary state.\n*   $\\mathbf{i\\delta_{k}}$: This is a crucial, infinitesimally small imaginary term ($ \\delta \\to 0^+ $). It ensures causality (i.e., that causes precede effects). The sign of $\\delta$ depends on whether the energy level $\\epsilon_k$ is occupied (part of the \"Fermi sea\") or unoccupied. For an unoccupied state (a \"particle\"), the sign is positive. For an occupied state (a \"hole\"), the sign is negative.\n\nThis formula shows that $G_0$ is **inversely proportional** to the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. The function has a \"pole\" (it diverges) when the propagating energy $\\omega$ is equal to the particle's intrinsic energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of $G_0$ for a given set of parameters, showing each number in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the bare Green's function G_0 for a given\n    frequency, single-particle energy, and a small imaginary part.\n\n    This example assumes a \"particle\" state, where the energy level is\n    unoccupied, so the sign of the imaginary part is positive.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the calculation\n    # omega (ω): The frequency (energy) of the propagating particle.\n    # epsilon_k (ε_k): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n    # delta (δ): A small positive infinitesimal to enforce causality.\n    omega = 2.5  # units of energy\n    epsilon_k = 2.2  # units of energy\n    delta = 0.1  # a small positive value\n\n    # The denominator of the Green's function\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * delta\n\n    # The bare Green's function G_0 is the reciprocal of the denominator\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # Print the full equation and the result, showing each number used.\n    # Greek letters ω, ε, δ are used for clarity.\n    print(f\"The formula for the bare Green's function is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0(k, \\u03C9) = 1 / (\\u03C9 - \\u03B5_k + i\\u03B4)\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Substituting the values:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{delta})\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({denominator.real:.2f} + {denominator.imag:.2f}i)\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe final result is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {G0.real:.4f} + ({G0.imag:.4f})i\")\n\n\n# Run the calculation and print the results\ncalculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is $G_0(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta_k)^{-1}$.
