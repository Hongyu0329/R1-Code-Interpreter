    "This is a highly specific question that requires visual analysis of a particular dance performance by a trained expert. This information is not available in my training data, and it cannot be reliably found by a program searching the web, as dance choreography is rarely documented with this level of move-by-move detail in publicly accessible text.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a factual answer.\n\nHowever, to fulfill your request for a code-based solution, I will provide a Python script that demonstrates how you might store and retrieve this kind of information if you had a database of performance details. Please be aware that the number used in the script is a placeholder for demonstration purposes and is **not** the correct count.\n\n```python\n# This script demonstrates how one might query a pre-existing, fictional database\n# of performance data. The data and numbers used here are placeholders for\n# illustrative purposes, as the actual count is not factually known.\n\nperformance_database = {\n    \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated - Jete Woman solo - Semperoper Ballett 2015\": {\n        \"dancer\": \"Svetlana Gileva\",\n        \"moves\": {\n            # This is a placeholder value and not the actual count.\n            # The real number requires visual analysis of the performance.\n            \"pas_de_balanchine\": 4\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n# Define the performance and move we are looking for\nperformance_key = \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated - Jete Woman solo - Semperoper Ballett 2015\"\nmove_key = \"pas_de_balanchine\"\n\n# Retrieve the placeholder data from our fictional database\nif performance_key in performance_database:\n    data = performance_database[performance_key]\n    dancer = data[\"dancer\"]\n    \n    if move_key in data[\"moves\"]:\n        count = data[\"moves\"][move_key]\n        print(f\"Querying a fictional database for the performance by {dancer}.\")\n        print(f\"The placeholder number for the count of '{move_key}'s is:\")\n        print(count)\n    else:\n        print(f\"Move '{move_key}' not found in the database for this performance.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Performance not found in the fictional database.\")\n\n```\n<<<I am unable to provide a factual answer for the number of pas de Balanchines performed.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
