    # 1. Open: Always true. S is defined by a condition on an open neighborhood, making S itself open.
    # 2. Closed: Not always true. Counterexample: f(x) = |x| on R^1 gives S = R - {0}, which is not closed.
    # 3. Connected: Not always true. Counterexample: f(x) = |x| on R^1 gives S = (-inf, 0) U (0, inf), not connected.
    # 4. Compact: Not always true. S must be open. A non-empty open set in R^n (n>=1) is not compact.
    # 5. Dense: Always true. This can be proven using Rademacher's theorem on the differentiability of Lipschitz functions.
    #           The argument shows that the complement of S cannot contain an open set.
    # 6. Connected complement: Not always true. A counterexample can be constructed where S = R - {-1, 1},
    #                        so the complement S^c = {-1, 1} is not connected.
    # 7. Trivial first singular homology group: Always true. The complement S^c is contained in a union of affine
    #                                           subspaces (where different isometries meet). Removing such sets from R^n
    #                                           does not create 1-dimensional holes.
