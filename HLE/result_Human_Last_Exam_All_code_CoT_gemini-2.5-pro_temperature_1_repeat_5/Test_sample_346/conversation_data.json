    "Answering this question requires reducing a complex SKI combinator expression to a Church numeral, and then finding its value. A Church numeral `n` is a function that, when applied to a function `f` and a value `x`, yields `f` applied `n` times to `x`.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Represent Combinators**: I will create a Python program where S, K, and I combinators, as well as function application, are represented by classes. This allows for building a symbolic representation of the expression.\n2.  **Parse the Expression**: The given string `S(I)(S(I)(...))` will be parsed into a nested structure of these class objects.\n3.  **Create a Reducer**: I will implement a function that systematically applies the reduction rules of SKI calculus:\n    *   `S x y z` reduces to `x z (y z)`\n    *   `K x y` reduces to `x`\n    *   `I x` reduces to `x`\n    The reducer will repeatedly traverse the expression tree and apply these rules until no more reductions are possible (i.e., the expression is in normal form).\n4.  **Evaluate the Numeral**: The problem states the expression is a Church integer `n`. To find its value, I will apply the reduced combinator `n` to symbolic representations of a function `f` and a value `x`. The resulting expression will be of the form `f(f(...f(x)...))`.\n5.  **Calculate the Result**: By counting the number of times `f` is applied to `x` in the final symbolic expression, I can determine the integer value of `n`. Finally, I'll compute `log_2(n)`.\n\nThis programmatic approach is robust and avoids the potential pitfalls of complex manual reductions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\n# Set a higher recursion limit for processing deeply nested expressions.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(20000)\n\nclass Combinator:\n    \"\"\"Base class for combinators to enable call chaining.\"\"\"\n    def __call__(self, arg):\n        return App(self, arg)\n    \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return self.__class__.__name__[0]\n\n# Define the three basic combinators S, K, I.\nclass S_c(Combinator): pass\nclass K_c(Combinator): pass\nclass I_c(Combinator): pass\n\n# Define symbolic placeholders for the function 'f' and value 'x'\n# used to evaluate the Church numeral.\nclass F_c(Combinator): pass\nclass X_c(Combinator): pass\n\nclass App(Combinator):\n    \"\"\"Represents the application of one expression to another.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, p, q):\n        self.p = p\n        self.q = q\n    \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"({self.p} {self.q})\"\n\n# Instantiate the combinators for use in parsing.\nS = S_c()\nK = K_c()\nI = I_c()\nf = F_c()\nx = X_c()\n\ndef parse_expression(s: str) -> Combinator:\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a string representation of a combinator expression into objects.\n    This uses eval() in a controlled manner, mapping names to safe objects.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Replace combinator names with their class instantiations.\n    s = s.replace('S', 'S')\n    s = s.replace('K', 'K')\n    s = s.replace('I', 'I')\n    # Convert function call syntax `A(B)` to application syntax `A(B)`.\n    s = s.replace(')(', ')(')\n    \n    # Evaluate the string in a controlled scope.\n    return eval(s, {\"S\": S, \"K\": K, \"I\": I})\n\ndef reduce_step(expr: Combinator) -> (Combinator, bool):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a single reduction step on an expression tree.\n    Returns the new expression and a boolean indicating if a change was made.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(expr, App):\n        return expr, False\n\n    # Reduction Rule: I x -> x\n    if isinstance(expr.p, I_c):\n        return expr.q, True\n\n    # Reduction Rule: K x y -> x\n    if isinstance(expr.p, App) and isinstance(expr.p.p, K_c):\n        return expr.p.q, True\n\n    # Reduction Rule: S x y z -> x z (y z)\n    if isinstance(expr.p, App) and isinstance(expr.p.p, App) and isinstance(expr.p.p.p, S_c):\n        x_comb, y_comb, z_comb = expr.p.p.q, expr.p.q, expr.q\n        return App(App(x_comb, z_comb), App(y_comb, z_comb)), True\n\n    # If no top-level rule applies, reduce the left part of the application.\n    new_p, changed = reduce_step(expr.p)\n    if changed:\n        return App(new_p, expr.q), True\n\n    # If the left part is stable, reduce the right part.\n    new_q, changed = reduce_step(expr.q)\n    if changed:\n        return App(expr.p, new_q), True\n\n    # If no part can be reduced, the expression is stable for this step.\n    return expr, False\n\ndef reduce_full(expr: Combinator) -> Combinator:\n    \"\"\"\n    Repeatedly applies reduction steps until the expression is in normal form.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A safety counter to prevent potential infinite loops in non-terminating expressions.\n    max_reductions = 30000 \n    for _ in range(max_reductions):\n        expr, changed = reduce_step(expr)\n        if not changed:\n            break\n    else:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Reduction limit exceeded, expression may not terminate.\")\n    return expr\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to execute the plan: parse, reduce, evaluate, and print the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    expression_string = \"S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))\"\n    \n    # 1.
