    "Of course, I can help with that. The creature you're referring to is a dinosaur. The polycyclic hydrocarbon is a type of biomarker, which is essentially a molecular fossil.\n\nHere is my plan to provide the answer using a Python script:\n1.  Identify the creature group that has been extinct for over 65 million years, which is dinosaurs.\n2.  Identify the specific polycyclic hydrocarbon biomarker named after them. This is \"Dino-sterane\".\n3.  Create a Python script that stores these pieces of information in variables.\n4.  The script will then print the answer in a clear and easy-to-read format, including the relevant number \"65\" from the question.\n\n```python\ndef find_hydrocarbon_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The creature group that has been extinct for over 65 million years\n    creature_group = \"Dinosaur\"\n    \n    # The relevant time period mentioned in the question\n    time_period = \"65 million years\"\n    \n    # The name of the polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    hydrocarbon_name = \"Dino-sterane\"\n    \n    # Print the information in a structured way\n    print(f\"The creature that has been extinct for over {time_period} is the {creature_group}.\")\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after it is called:\")\n    print(f\"--> {hydrocarbon_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation: Dino-steranes are complex molecular fossils (biomarkers) found in rocks. They are derived from the steroids of organisms that lived during the age of dinosaurs.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer\nfind_hydrocarbon_name()\n```\n<<<Dino-sterane>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
