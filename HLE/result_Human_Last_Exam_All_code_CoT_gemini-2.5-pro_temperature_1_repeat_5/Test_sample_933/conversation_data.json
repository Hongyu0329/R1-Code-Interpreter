    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), we need to review the established chemical synthesis methods. The most common and direct method involves the reaction of xenon gas (Xe) with fluorine gas (F₂).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  State the primary chemical reaction for the synthesis of XeF₄.\n2.  Review the standard reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, reactant ratio) required for this synthesis to be efficient.\n3.  Compare the standard optimal temperature with the given answer choices.\n4.  Identify the correct choice and present it using a Python script that explains the reasoning.\n\nThe script will outline the synthesis process and conditions, then print the correct answer based on this chemical knowledge.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    to determine the optimal temperature from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The primary method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct\n    # heating of xenon and fluorine gases in a sealed nickel container.\n    # The reaction is: Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\n\n    # Scientific literature and chemistry textbooks state that the optimal conditions\n    # for an efficient yield of XeF₄ are:\n    # - A stoichiometric excess of fluorine (e.g., 1:5 molar ratio of Xe to F₂).\n    # - Heating the mixture to approximately 400 °C.\n    # - A pressure of about 6 atmospheres.\n\n    # Let's evaluate the given choices based on this information:\n    # A. 600 °C: This temperature is too high and tends to favor the production of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n    # B. 400 °C: This is the widely accepted optimal temperature for efficiently producing XeF₄.\n    # C. 200 °C: The reaction rate is too slow at this temperature for efficient production.\n    # D. 78 °C: Too low for an efficient thermal reaction.\n    # E. 0 °C: Too low for an efficient thermal reaction.\n    # F. -78 °C: Far too cold for this synthesis method.\n\n    # Therefore, 400 °C is the standard temperature used for this synthesis.\n\n    correct_choice = 'B'\n    correct_temperature = 400\n\n    print(\"The chemical equation for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride is:\")\n    print(\"Xe + 2*F2 -> XeF4\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis reaction is most efficiently carried out at a temperature of {correct_temperature} °C.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the correct choice is {correct_choice}.\")\n\nfind_synthesis_temperature()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
