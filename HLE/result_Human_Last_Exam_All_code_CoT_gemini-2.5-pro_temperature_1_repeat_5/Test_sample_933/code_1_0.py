    This function analyzes the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)

    # The primary method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct
    # heating of xenon and fluorine gases in a sealed nickel container.
    # The reaction is: Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄

    # Scientific literature and chemistry textbooks state that the optimal conditions
    # for an efficient yield of XeF₄ are:
    # - A stoichiometric excess of fluorine (e.g., 1:5 molar ratio of Xe to F₂).
    # - Heating the mixture to approximately 400 °C.
    # - A pressure of about 6 atmospheres.

    # Let's evaluate the given choices based on this information:
    # A. 600 °C: This temperature is too high and tends to favor the production of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).
    # B. 400 °C: This is the widely accepted optimal temperature for efficiently producing XeF₄.
    # C. 200 °C: The reaction rate is too slow at this temperature for efficient production.
    # D. 78 °C: Too low for an efficient thermal reaction.
    # E. 0 °C: Too low for an efficient thermal reaction.
    # F. -78 °C: Far too cold for this synthesis method.

    # Therefore, 400 °C is the standard temperature used for this synthesis.
