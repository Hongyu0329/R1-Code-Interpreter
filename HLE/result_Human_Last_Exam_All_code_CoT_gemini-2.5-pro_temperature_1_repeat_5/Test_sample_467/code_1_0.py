    # The Morse index of a complete minimal surface in R^3 with finite total curvature
    # is given by the Lopez-Ros formula: Index = 2d + 2γ - k
    # where:
    # - d is the degree of the Gauss map.
    # - γ is the genus of the underlying compact Riemann surface.
    # - k is the number of punctures (ends) on the surface.

    # Step 1: Determine the parameters γ (genus) and k (number of ends).
    # The surface M is conformally equivalent to the complex plane C.
    # C is topologically a sphere (genus 0) with one puncture.
    gamma = 0

    # The degree of a rational map is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.
