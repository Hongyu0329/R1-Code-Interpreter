# The problem asks for the coefficients c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5 in the given expression.
# Based on the mathematical derivation, these coefficients are determined as follows:

# c_1 corresponds to walks on a single edge (P_2 tree).
c_1 = 2

# c_2 corresponds to the number of K_3 subgraphs. Our analysis shows that all
# tree-like walks are counted by considering their underlying tree structure (P_2, P_3, P_4, K_1,3).
# These structures are subgraphs, not necessarily induced subgraphs. The calculations on these
# tree subgraphs already correctly account for all tree-like walks, regardless of whether
# additional edges exist (like in a K_3). Therefore, there is no separate term for k.
c_2 = 0

# c_3 corresponds to walks on a P_4 tree.
c_3 = 6

# c_4 corresponds to walks on a P_3 tree.
c_4 = 12

# c_5 corresponds to walks on a K_1,3 (star) tree.
c_5 = 12
