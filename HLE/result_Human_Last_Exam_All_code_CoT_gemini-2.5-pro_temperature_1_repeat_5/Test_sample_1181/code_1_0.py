# The user wants to identify a character from the 1972 movie "Solaris".
# The key detail is the character's shame or longing for the sound of rustling leaves.

# This sentiment is a core part of the protagonist's emotional journey.
# Kris Kelvin, the psychologist sent from Earth, is constantly haunted by his memories
# of his home, which are depicted with lush, natural imagery (water, trees, a dacha).
# This stands in stark contrast to the sterile, artificial environment of the Solaris station.
# His homesickness and guilt are central to the film, making him the character
# most deeply affected by the loss of such Earthly sensations.
