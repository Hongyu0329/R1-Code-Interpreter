    "My plan is to answer the user's trivia question about the 1972 movie *Solaris*.\n\n1.  I will first analyze the provided character options in the context of the film's plot and themes.\n2.  The central theme of the film for the protagonist is his profound sense of loss and longing for Earth, which is represented by memories of nature.\n3.  I will identify the character whose emotional journey is most closely tied to missing the sensory experiences of Earth, such as the sound of rustling leaves.\n4.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script that declares this character's name as the answer and prints it out.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify a character from the 1972 movie \"Solaris\".\n# The key detail is the character's shame or longing for the sound of rustling leaves.\n\n# This sentiment is a core part of the protagonist's emotional journey.\n# Kris Kelvin, the psychologist sent from Earth, is constantly haunted by his memories\n# of his home, which are depicted with lush, natural imagery (water, trees, a dacha).\n# This stands in stark contrast to the sterile, artificial environment of the Solaris station.\n# His homesickness and guilt are central to the film, making him the character\n# most deeply affected by the loss of such Earthly sensations.\n\ncorrect_character = \"Kris\"\nanswer_choice = \"A\"\n\nprint(f\"The character from the 1972 movie 'Solaris' who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth is {correct_character}.\")\nprint(f\"This is answer choice {answer_choice}.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
