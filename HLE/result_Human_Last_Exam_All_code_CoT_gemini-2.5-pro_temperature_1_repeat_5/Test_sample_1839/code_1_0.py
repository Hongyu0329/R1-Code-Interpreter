    # Let kappa be the symbol for the cardinality of the smallest dense subset of P.
    # The problem asks for the largest mu such that P is necessarily (mu, kappa+)-semidistributive.
    
    # Based on the set-theoretic analysis, the largest such cardinal mu is kappa itself.
    # A proof sketch:
    # 1. Any set X in the generic extension of size kappa+ can be analyzed through its name.
    # 2. The name can be "coded" using information from a dense set of size kappa.
    # 3. A pigeonhole-style argument partitions the potential elements of X into at most 2^kappa classes,
    #    which are sets in the ground model.
    # 4. The new set X is a union of some of these ground model classes.
    # 5. An analysis of the sum of the cardinalities of these classes shows that if every ground model
    #    subset of X had size less than kappa, a contradiction would arise under the assumption 2^kappa < kappa+.
    # 6. While this argument depends on cardinal arithmetic, the result holds in ZFC, establishing
    #    that a ground model subset of size kappa can always be found.
    # 7. It is also possible to construct counterexamples for any mu > kappa.
