    Explains why the provided Rust code will not compile.

    explanation = """
    The provided Rust code will fail to compile due to a combination of a critical error and a warning.

    1. Compilation Error: Borrow Checker Violation in `FeedForward::backward`
       The core issue is a violation of Rust's borrowing rules. In the `FeedForward::backward` method, lines like the following attempt to both read from and modify a matrix in the same statement:

       `self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - ...);`

       - The `self.w2.set(...)` call requires a mutable borrow (`&mut self.w2`).
       - The `self.w2.get(...)` call, which is an argument to `set`, requires an immutable borrow (`&self.w2`).

       Rust's safety guarantees prevent having a mutable borrow at the same time as any other borrow. Because the immutable borrow from `get()` must exist for the `set()` call to proceed, the compiler correctly identifies this as a conflict and reports a compilation error. The same error pattern is present in the update logic for `self.w1`.

    2. Compiler Warning: Shadowed Method in `Matrix`
       The `Matrix` struct is defined with `#[derive(Clone)]` and also has a manual method implementation named `clone`.

       - `#[derive(Clone)]` automatically generates the standard `clone` method from the `Clone` trait.
       - The `impl Matrix` block defines another method, `fn clone(&self) -> Matrix`.

       When a struct's own method has the same name as a method from a trait it implements, the compiler issues a warning about the method being "shadowed" or hidden, as it can lead to ambiguous or unexpected behavior.

    Conclusion:
    The code will not compile because of the borrow checker error. The compiler's output will contain both the error message and the warning about the shadowed method.
