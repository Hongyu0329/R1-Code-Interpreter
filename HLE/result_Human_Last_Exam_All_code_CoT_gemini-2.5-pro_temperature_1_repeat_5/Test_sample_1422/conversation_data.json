    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of vertices (V) required to construct a two-loop Feynman diagram in a scalar field theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify Key Formulas:** We'll use two fundamental formulas that relate the properties of a connected Feynman diagram:\n    *   The topological formula relating the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V): `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   The rule for vertices in a $\\phi^4$ theory, which states that four lines meet at each vertex. This gives the relation: `4 * V = 2 * I + E`, where E is the number of external lines.\n\n2.  **State the Goal:** We are given that the diagram must have two loops (L=2), and we want to find the *minimum* possible number of vertices (V).\n\n3.  **Formulate a Strategy:** To minimize the number of vertices (V), we should consider the simplest possible type of diagram. The simplest diagrams are vacuum bubbles, which have no external lines (E=0). By setting E=0, we can solve the system of equations for the smallest possible integer V.\n\n4.  **Execute the Plan:**\n    *   Set L=2 and E=0 in the formulas.\n    *   Solve the first equation for I in terms of V.\n    *   Substitute this expression for I into the second equation.\n    *   Solve the resulting equation for V.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, printing out each step of the derivation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for an interacting scalar phi^4 field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # L = number of loops\n    # V = number of vertices\n    # I = number of internal lines\n    # E = number of external lines\n\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V), we use two key formulas for connected Feynman diagrams:\")\n    print(\"1.
