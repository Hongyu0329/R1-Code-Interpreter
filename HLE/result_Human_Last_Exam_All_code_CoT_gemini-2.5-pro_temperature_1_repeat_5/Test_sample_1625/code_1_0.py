    # The question asks for the spectral series expansion technique used for
    # the poloidal dependence in toroidal systems.

    # 1. In a toroidal coordinate system, the 'poloidal' direction is the short
    #    way around the torus. It is an angular coordinate, typically denoted by theta (θ).
    # 2. Since it's an angle, any physical quantity described by it must be periodic.
    #    For example, the magnetic field at angle θ must be the same as at θ + 2π.
    # 3. The standard mathematical tool for representing periodic functions is the
    #    Fourier series, which expands a function into a sum of sines and cosines.
    # 4. Therefore, the Fourier series is the adapted technique. This corresponds to option D.
