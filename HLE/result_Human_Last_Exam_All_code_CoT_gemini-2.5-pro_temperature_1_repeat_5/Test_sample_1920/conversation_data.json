    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we will follow a structured approach.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor and Order**: We are given a conductor $d = 53599$ and an order $g = 6$. We will start by finding the prime factorization of $d$. Since $d$ is a product of distinct primes (square-free), this simplifies the problem.\n2.  **Decomposition of Characters**: For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo the prime factor $p_i$.\n3.  **Condition for Primitive Characters**: A character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $d$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is non-principal. A character is non-principal if its order is greater than 1.\n4.  **Condition on the Order**: The order of the combined character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$. We need this lcm to be exactly 6.\n5.  **Counting Characters**: The number of characters of a specific order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides the order of the character group, which is $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n6.  **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: We will calculate the number of primitive characters whose order *divides* 6. This is found by counting, for each prime factor $p_i$, the number of non-principal characters with an order dividing 6, and then multiplying these counts. From this total, we will subtract the number of characters whose order is a *proper divisor* of 6 (namely, 2 or 3) to isolate those with an order of exactly 6.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the following Python script. The script will carry out the necessary number-theoretic calculations and print the logic at each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Let d = {d}.
