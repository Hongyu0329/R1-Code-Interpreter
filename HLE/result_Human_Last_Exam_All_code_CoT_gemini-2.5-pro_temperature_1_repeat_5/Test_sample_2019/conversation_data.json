    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. A toroidal board means it wraps around both horizontally and vertically, so queens can attack each other across the edges.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Simplify with Symmetry:** The problem can be broken down into two parts: choosing which 4 rows will contain the queens, and then for that choice of rows, arranging the queens in the columns. Due to the board's toroidal symmetry, the number of valid arrangements is the same regardless of which 4 rows we choose. For example, the number of solutions for rows {0, 1, 2, 3} is identical to the number of solutions for rows {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n2.  **Count Row Choices:** We first calculate the number of ways to choose 4 rows from the 5 available. This is a combination calculation, C(5, 4).\n\n3.  **Count Column Placements:** Next, we pick one specific set of rows (e.g., rows 0, 1, 2, and 3) and find all valid ways to place the 4 queens in the 5 columns. We will use a backtracking algorithm for this search. The algorithm will place one queen at a time, ensuring it doesn't attack any previously placed queens according to the rules of the toroidal board (no same row, column, or toroidal diagonal).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** The final answer is the product of the number of ways to choose the rows (from Step 2) and the number of valid placements for a single choice of rows (from Step 3).\n\nThe Python code below implements this logic. It performs the backtracking search to find the number of valid placements for a fixed set of rows and then calculates the total number of ways.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass ToroidalQueensSolver:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the N-queens problem on a toroidal board for K queens.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, n, k):\n        self.n = n  # Board size\n        self.k = k  # Number of queens\n        # We can fix the rows due to symmetry.
