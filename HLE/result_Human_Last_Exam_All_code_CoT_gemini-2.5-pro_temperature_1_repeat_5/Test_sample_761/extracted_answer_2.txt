No, structurally, polynucleotides are not polysaccharides. They are fundamentally different types of macromolecules due to their distinct monomers (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), linking bonds (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic), and elemental composition (polynucleotides contain nitrogen and phosphorus, which polysaccharides lack).
