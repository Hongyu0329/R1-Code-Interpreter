    "My plan is to provide a clear, step-by-step comparison of the chemical structures of polynucleotides and polysaccharides to answer your question. I will focus on three key structural aspects: their basic building blocks (monomers), the chemical bonds that link these monomers, and the overall composition of the resulting polymer chain. This detailed comparison will demonstrate that they are fundamentally different types of macromolecules. The final explanation will be presented within a Python code block using a `print` statement, as you requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_structural_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a detailed explanation comparing the structures of\n    polynucleotides and polysaccharides.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nNo, structurally, polynucleotides are not polysaccharides. This holds true even for homopolynucleotides. They are two fundamentally different classes of biological macromolecules.\n\nHere is a breakdown of their key structural differences:\n\n1. Monomers (The Basic Building Blocks):\n   - Polysaccharide Monomer: A monosaccharide (a simple sugar, like glucose). It is a single carbohydrate unit.\n   - Polynucleotide Monomer: A nucleotide. This is a much more complex unit composed of THREE distinct parts:\n     a) A pentose (5-carbon) sugar (either deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA).\n     b) A phosphate group.\n     c) A nitrogenous base (e.g., Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine, Uracil).\n\n2. Polymer Backbone and Linking Bonds:\n   - Polysaccharides: Monosaccharide units are linked together by GLYCOSIDIC BONDS to form a chain of sugars. The backbone consists only of sugar units.\n   - Polynucleotides: Nucleotide units are linked together by PHOSPHODIESTER BONDS. This bond forms between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar of the next, creating a repeating SUGAR-PHOSPHATE backbone.\n\n3. Elemental Composition:\n   - Polysaccharides: Composed primarily of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (general formula (CHâ‚‚O)n).\n   - Polynucleotides: In addition to Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (from the sugar), they always contain Nitrogen (in the bases) and Phosphorus (in the phosphate groups).\n\nSummary:\nBecause their monomer units, linking bonds, and elemental composition are completely different, a polynucleotide cannot be considered a polysaccharide. A polysaccharide is a polymer of sugars, while a polynucleotide is a polymer of nucleotides.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_structural_differences()\n```\n<<<No, structurally, polynucleotides are not polysaccharides. They are fundamentally different types of macromolecules due to their distinct monomers (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), linking bonds (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic), and elemental composition (polynucleotides contain nitrogen and phosphorus, which polysaccharides lack).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Are polynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides? or, to be more clear: Are homopolynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides?\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
