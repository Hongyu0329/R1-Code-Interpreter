No, structurally, polynucleotides are not polysaccharides. This holds true even for homopolynucleotides. They are two fundamentally different classes of biological macromolecules.

Here is a breakdown of their key structural differences:

1. Monomers (The Basic Building Blocks):
   - Polysaccharide Monomer: A monosaccharide (a simple sugar, like glucose). It is a single carbohydrate unit.
   - Polynucleotide Monomer: A nucleotide. This is a much more complex unit composed of THREE distinct parts:
     a) A pentose (5-carbon) sugar (either deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA).
     b) A phosphate group.
     c) A nitrogenous base (e.g., Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine, Uracil).

2. Polymer Backbone and Linking Bonds:
   - Polysaccharides: Monosaccharide units are linked together by GLYCOSIDIC BONDS to form a chain of sugars. The backbone consists only of sugar units.
   - Polynucleotides: Nucleotide units are linked together by PHOSPHODIESTER BONDS. This bond forms between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the sugar of the next, creating a repeating SUGAR-PHOSPHATE backbone.

3. Elemental Composition:
   - Polysaccharides: Composed primarily of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (general formula (CHâ‚‚O)n).
   - Polynucleotides: In addition to Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (from the sugar), they always contain Nitrogen (in the bases) and Phosphorus (in the phosphate groups).

Summary:
Because their monomer units, linking bonds, and elemental composition are completely different, a polynucleotide cannot be considered a polysaccharide. A polysaccharide is a polymer of sugars, while a polynucleotide is a polymer of nucleotides.
