    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties:**\n    The semidihedral group, denoted as $SD_{2^n}$, has an order of $2^n$. The given group size is 512, so we have $2^n = 512$, which gives $n = \\log_2(512) = 9$.\n    The group $SD_{512}$ has a presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$. It contains a maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order $2^{n-1} = 256$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:**\n    A power subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup that can be expressed as $H = G^m = \\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $m$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n3.  **Analyze Based on the Parity of the Exponent 'm':**\n    The structure of the power subgroup $G^m$ depends on whether the exponent $m$ is odd or even.\n\n    *   **Case 1: 'm' is an odd number.**\n        For any odd integer $m$, the mapping $g \\to g^m$ is a bijection on $SD_{512}$. This means that for every element $h$ in the group, there is a unique element $g$ such that $g^m = h$. Therefore, the set of $m$-th powers of all elements is the group itself ($G^m = G$). This case gives us **1** unique power subgroup, which is $SD_{512}$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: 'm' is an even number.**\n        For any even integer $m$, the $m$-th power of any element in $SD_{512}$ will be an element of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$. The resulting power subgroup is of the form $\\langle r^d \\rangle$, where $d = \\text{gcd}(m, 256)$. Since $m$ is even, $d$ must be an even divisor of 256. The even divisors of 256 are $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$ (which are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256). Each of these divisors generates a distinct cyclic subgroup. This gives us $n-1 = 9-1 = \\textbf{8}$ unique power subgroups.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total:**\n    The total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the two cases, as the subgroups generated are distinct.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the order is 2^n.\n    # We find n such that 2^n = group_size.\n    if group_size <= 1 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group size must be a power of 2 greater than 1.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # Case 1: The exponent 'm' is odd.\n    # For any odd m, the power subgroup G^m is the group G itself.\n    # This contributes 1 unique subgroup.\n    num_from_odd_m = 1\n\n    # Case 2: The exponent 'm' is even.\n    # For any even m, the power subgroup G^m is a cyclic subgroup <r^d>,\n    # where d is an even divisor of 2^(n-1).\n    # The number of such distinct subgroups is n-1.\n    num_from_even_m = n - 1\n\n    # Total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases.\n    total_subgroups = num_from_odd_m + num_from_even_m\n\n    print(\"The number of power subgroups is calculated by considering two cases for the exponent 'm'.\")\n    print(f\"1. For odd 'm': This results in {num_from_odd_m} unique subgroup (the group itself).\")\n    print(f\"2. For even 'm': This results in {num_from_even_m} unique cyclic subgroups.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum of these two cases.\")\n    print(f\"{num_from_odd_m} + {num_from_even_m} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve_power_subgroups()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
