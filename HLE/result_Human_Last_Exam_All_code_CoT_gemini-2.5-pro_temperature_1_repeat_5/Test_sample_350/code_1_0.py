1. The question asks for the two key historical thinkers who influenced Wolfhart Pannenberg's concept of cosmic history built on contingent time.

2. Pannenberg's argument for history as the primary mode of God's self-revelation is famously a theological reworking of the philosophy of history developed by Georg Hegel. Hegel saw history as the progressive self-manifestation of the Absolute Spirit. Pannenberg adapts this to argue for history as the stage for God's self-revelation. Therefore, Georg Hegel is the first key figure.

3. Pannenberg's later work integrated modern science and physics into a "theology of nature" to form a "cosmic history." To do this, he drew upon the 'Naturphilosophie' (philosophy of nature) of Friedrich Schelling. Schelling's view of nature as a dynamic, developing process provided a philosophical basis for Pannenberg to connect theology with the contingent, field-based concepts of modern physics. Therefore, Friedrich Schelling is the second key figure.

4. Based on this analysis, the correct pair of influencers is Georg Hegel and Friedrich Schelling.
