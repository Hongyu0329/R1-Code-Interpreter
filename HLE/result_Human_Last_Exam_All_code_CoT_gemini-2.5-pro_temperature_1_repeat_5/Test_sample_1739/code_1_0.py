    This function calculates the coefficient of the third term in the nonlinear
    frequency correction for the given Rayleigh-Plesset equation.
    
    The derivation via the method of multiple scales shows that the second-order
    frequency correction, omega_2, is given by:
    omega_2 = a^2 * (C1 * omega_0^5 + C2 * omega_0^3 + C3 * omega_0)
    
    where 'a' is the oscillation amplitude and 'omega_0' is the linear frequency.
    
    The coefficients C1, C2, and C3 are found to be:
    C1 = 1/24
    C2 = 13/16
    C3 = 11/8
    
    The problem asks for the 3rd term, which we interpret as the coefficient C3.
