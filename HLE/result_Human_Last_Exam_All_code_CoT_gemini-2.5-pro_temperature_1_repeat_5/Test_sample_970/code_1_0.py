    This function determines the necessary assumptions for a Bayesian agent's
    expected information gain to converge to zero and formats them in
    Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

    The necessary assumptions are:
    a. The prior has finite entropy.
    b. The agent interacts with an MDP with a finite state space, or a compact state space with Lipschitz continuous dynamics).
    c. The limit as time goes to infinity of the state occupancy distribution induced by the agent's policy exists.

    These are represented as literals 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
    Since all are necessary, the logical form is (a AND b AND c).

    The required output format is CNF: [(clause1) AND (clause2) ...],
    with alphabetical ordering.
    For (a AND b AND c), the clauses are (a), (b), and (c).
