    print("--- Conceptual Analysis ---")
    print("\nThe question is whether an arbitrary vector beam can be generated from an input beam with a controllable spatial profile but a fixed linear polarization.")
    print("\nLet's break it down by the degrees of freedom:")

    print("\n1. The Input Beam:")
    print("   - It has a controlled phase and amplitude, which means we can shape one complex scalar function, U_in(x, y).")
    print("   - However, its polarization is fixed and linear. This means the input has only ONE controllable functional degree of freedom.")

    print("\n2. The Desired Output Beam:")
    print("   - An 'arbitrary vector beam' requires its two orthogonal polarization components (e.g., horizontal and vertical) to be independently specified.")
    print("   - This means the desired output has TWO independent functional degrees of freedom, E_x(x, y) and E_y(x, y).")

    print("\n3. The System and its Limitation:")
    print("   - The optical system, though complex, is a fixed linear operator. It creates a fixed mathematical relationship between the input and the output.")
    print("   - To create the output, the system acts on the single input function U_in(x, y) to produce the two output functions E_x(x, y) and E_y(x, y).")
    print("   - Because both output functions are determined by the same single input function, they cannot be independent of each other.")
    print("   - You can choose your input to get a specific E_x, but the system will then dictate the resulting E_y. You cannot choose them both freely.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("It is fundamentally impossible to control two independent degrees of freedom (the output vector components) using only one degree of freedom (the input scalar field).")
