        "B. Chromosomal inversions": "These are known to *suppress* recombination in heterozygotes. Therefore, they contribute to the problem of limited recombination rather than compensating for it.",
        "C. Transposable elements": "These 'jumping genes' are often considered parasitic. While they drive genome evolution, they are not a primary compensatory mechanism and their accumulation can be a sign of ineffective selection, which is a *consequence* of low recombination.",
        "D. Multigene families": "These are sets of similar genes created by duplication. Having multiple copies of an essential gene provides redundancy. If one copy accumulates a deleterious mutation and becomes non-functional, the other copies can still perform the function. This directly counteracts the effects of Muller's Ratchet by providing 'backup' copies. This is the strongest candidate.",
        "E. Polyploidy": "This is the state of having more than two full sets of chromosomes. Like multigene families, it provides gene redundancy. However, multigene families are a more specific and widespread *architectural feature* that can evolve in targeted, non-recombining regions of a genome (e.g., on a Y chromosome within a diploid organism), making it a more precise answer to the question."
