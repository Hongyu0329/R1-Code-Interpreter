    print("  - If a space X is arcwise connected, then for any two points x, y in X, the arc joining them is a continuum K satisfying {x, y} subset of K subset of X.")

    print("  - a) Is S = X dense in X? Yes, the closure of a space in itself is the space itself.")
    print("  - b) Is S = X continuum-connected? Yes, because X is hereditarily decomposable, which implies it's arcwise connected, which in turn implies it's continuum-connected.")
    print("  - c) Does S = X contain p? Yes, because p was chosen as an arbitrary point from X.")
    print("  - Since all conditions are met, we have found a valid set S (namely X) for any point p in X.\n")

    print("  - This means that every point in any hereditarily decomposable continuum X is a coastal point.")
