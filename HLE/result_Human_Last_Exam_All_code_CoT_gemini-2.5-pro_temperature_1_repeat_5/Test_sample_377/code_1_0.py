# The number of blocks is determined by a counting argument on the group structure.
# The calculation steps are algebraic and do not require complex coding.
# Here is the summary of the final calculation based on the plan.

# Total number of conjugacy classes in S = 3^{1+2}_+
total_classes_S = 11

# The kernel K of the action is a maximal subgroup of S, isomorphic to C_3 x C_3.
# An S-conjugacy class is either entirely contained in K or entirely outside K.
# We need to count the number of S-conjugacy classes contained in K.
# Let S = <a, b, c | a^3=b^3=c^3=1, [a,b]=c, [a,c]=[b,c]=1>.
# The center is Z(S) = <c>.
# Let the kernel K be the maximal subgroup <a, c>. K is isomorphic to C_3 x C_3.
# The conjugacy classes of S are:
# - 3 central classes: {1}, {c}, {c^2}. All are in K.
# - 8 non-central classes of size 3.
# We check which non-central classes are in K.
# The class of 'a' is {a, ac, ac^2}, which is contained in K.
# The class of 'a^2' is {a^2, a^2*c, a^2*c^2}, which is also in K.
# The elements of K are {a^i * c^j for i,j in {0,1,2}}. There are 9 such elements.
# The elements from the 5 classes above ({1},{c},{c^2},C(a),C(a^2)) sum up to 1+1+1+3+3=9 elements.
# These are all the elements of K.
# So, the number of S-conjugacy classes contained in K is 5.
classes_in_K = 5

# The number of classes outside K is the difference.
classes_outside_K = total_classes_S - classes_in_K
