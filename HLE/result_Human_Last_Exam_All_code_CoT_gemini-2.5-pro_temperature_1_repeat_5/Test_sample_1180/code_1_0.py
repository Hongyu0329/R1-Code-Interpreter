    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction.
    
    Step 1: Determine the equation of the special fiber by reducing the curve's equation modulo 2.
    The curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.
    Modulo 2, this becomes z^2 = 1, or (z-1)^2 = 0.
    
    Step 2: Identify the multiplicity of the component in the special fiber.
    The special fiber is the line z=1 with multiplicity m=2.
    
    Step 3: Calculate the thickness.
    The thickness of a component with multiplicity m is defined as m - 1.
