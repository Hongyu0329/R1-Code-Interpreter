# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with properties that uniquely define it as the Stone-Čech compactification
# of the long ray, βR.

# As explained in the reasoning above, any space X satisfying the given conditions
# must be homeomorphic to βR.

# Since all such spaces belong to the same homeomorphism class (the class of βR),
# there is only one such class.

# The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
# The following code prints this result.
# There is no equation, so we will just print the final numerical answer.

number_of_classes = 1
