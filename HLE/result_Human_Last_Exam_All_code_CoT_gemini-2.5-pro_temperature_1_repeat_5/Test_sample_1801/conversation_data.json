    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will find the names of the two Nobel laureates who appeared in the 2000 Enron commercial. Then, to adhere to the requested format, I will write a simple Python script that stores these names in variables and prints the answer.\n\n```python\n# The two Nobel laureates who appeared in the 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial.\nlaureate1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\nlaureate2 = \"Merton Miller\"\n\nprint(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial were {laureate1} and {laureate2}.\")\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
