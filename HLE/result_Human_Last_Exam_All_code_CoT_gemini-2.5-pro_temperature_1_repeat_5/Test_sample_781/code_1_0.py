def solve_continuum_decomposition():
    """
    Solves the mathematical problem about continuum decomposition.

    The problem states:
    - X is a metric continuum.
    - It has 5 distinct points: a, b, c, d, e.
    - No proper subcontinuum of X contains any three of these points.
      This means for any three points {p, q, r}, the smallest continuum K({p,q,r}) containing them is X itself.
    - We want to find the largest number n for a decomposition X = A_1 U ... U A_n,
      where each A_i is a subcontinuum and has a "private part", i.e., A_i is not covered by the others.

    Our reasoning is as follows:
    1. Let K({p,q}) be the smallest subcontinuum containing points p and q.
       From the main condition, for any three points p, q, r, the union K({p,q}) U K({q,r}) is a continuum
       containing {p,q,r}. Therefore, this union must be equal to X.
       So, X = K({p,q}) U K({q,r}).

    2. Let's try to construct the decomposition using continua of the form K({p,q}).
       Let's associate the decomposition with a graph G where the vertices are the 5 points,
       and the edges correspond to the pairs {p,q} we choose for our continua A_i = K({p,q}).

    3. For the union of these A_i to cover X, the graph G must be connected.

    4. For the decomposition to be valid (each A_i having a private part), the graph G cannot contain any cycles.
       Why? If there is a cycle, for instance a triangle on {a,b,c}, we would choose A_1=K({a,b}), A_2=K({b,c}), A_3=K({c,a}).
       From point 1, X = K({a,b}) U K({b,c}) = A_1 U A_2.
       This means A_3 is completely covered by A_1 and A_2, so it has no private part.
       This violates the condition for a valid decomposition. The same logic holds for any cycle.

    5. Therefore, the graph G must be connected and acyclic. Such a graph is a tree.

    6. To include all 5 points, we need a spanning tree on the 5 vertices.
       A spanning tree on m vertices always has m-1 edges.
       For m=5 points, the number of edges is 5 - 1 = 4.

    7. This means we can form a valid decomposition with n=4 continua. For example, corresponding
       to the path graph a-b-c-d-e, we can set:
       A_1 = K({a,b})
       A_2 = K({b,c})
       A_3 = K({c,d})
       A_4 = K({d,e})
       The union X = A_1 U A_2 U A_3 U A_4 is a valid decomposition.

    8. Since any graph on 5 vertices with 5 or more edges must contain a cycle, n cannot be larger than 4.
       Thus, the largest possible number n is 4.
