    "Of course, I can help you with that. The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This space is known as the Grassmannian $Gr(3, 5)$.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem using a Python script:\n1.  The space $Gr(3, 5)$ is a compact manifold that can be represented as a homogeneous space $G/K$ of Lie groups. Specifically, it is homotopy equivalent to $SO(5) / (SO(3) \\times SO(2))$.\n2.  A theorem by A. Borel states that if $G$ and $K$ are compact, connected Lie groups with the same rank, the integral cohomology ring $H^*(G/K; \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free.\n3.  A torsion-free group has a trivial torsion subgroup (the subgroup containing only the identity element). The rank of the trivial group is 0.\n4.  The rank of the special orthogonal group $SO(n)$ is given by the formula $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.\n5.  I will write a Python script that calculates the rank of $G = SO(5)$ and the rank of $K = SO(3) \\times SO(2)$ (which is the sum of the ranks of $SO(3)$ and $SO(2)$).\n6.  The script will then compare these ranks. If they are equal, it will conclude that the cohomology ring is torsion-free and the rank of its torsion subgroup is 0.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral\n# cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5. This space is\n# the Grassmannian Gr(3, 5).\n\n# The argument relies on a theorem from algebraic topology. The Grassmannian\n# Gr(k, n) is homotopy equivalent to the homogeneous space G/K where\n# G = SO(n) and K = SO(k) x SO(n-k).\n# A theorem by A. Borel states that if G and K are compact connected Lie\n# groups and rank(G) = rank(K), the integral cohomology ring H*(G/K; Z) is\n# torsion-free. A torsion-free ring has a trivial torsion subgroup,\n# whose rank is 0.\n\n# We will verify this condition for Gr(3, 5).\n\n# Step 1: Define parameters for the space Gr(k, n).\nk = 3\nn = 5\n\ndef rank_so(m):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the rank of the Lie group SO(m), which is floor(m/2).\"\"\"\n    return math.floor(m / 2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the rank of the group G = SO(n).\nrank_G = rank_so(n)\nn_minus_k = n - k\n\nprint(f\"To find the rank of the torsion subgroup of H*(Gr({k}, {n}); Z), we check if the ring is torsion-free.\")\nprint(f\"The space Gr({k}, {n}) is homotopy equivalent to the homogeneous space G/K, where G = SO({n}) and K = SO({k}) x SO({n-k}).\")\nprint(\"According to a theorem by A.
