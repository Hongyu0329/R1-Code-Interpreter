/*
 * This program calculates the gravitational time dilation factor f
 * for the Pioneer probe near the pulsar Pandora on the Wuxing architecture.
 *
 * The formula is f = sqrt(1 - (2*G*M)/(r*c^2)).
 *
 * The calculation proceeds as follows:
 * 1. The term X = (2*G*M)/(r*c^2) is calculated using an order of
 *    operations that avoids intermediate overflow. With the chosen
 *    fractional constants, X simplifies to 2/27.
 * 2. y = 1 - X is calculated, resulting in 25/27.
 * 3. f = sqrt(y) is approximated using a single iteration of the
 *    Babylonian method (f_new = (1+y)/2), as further iterations
 *    would overflow the 'frac' type. The result is 26/27.
 *
 * Memory Usage (z):
 * - The program uses 6 variables of type 'frac'.
 * - Each frac is 3 * 2D = 6D.
 * - Total memory z = 6 variables * 6D/variable = 36D.
