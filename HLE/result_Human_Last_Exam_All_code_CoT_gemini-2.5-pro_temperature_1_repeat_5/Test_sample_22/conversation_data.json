    "The statement is **True**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This represents the *theoretical upper limit* of the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by all the SNPs included in the analysis (typically common SNPs on a genotyping array). It is a population parameter that quantifies the total contribution of these SNPs to the trait's heritability. It's the \"ceiling\" of how well we could possibly predict the phenotype using only SNP data.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS is a *practical tool* used to predict a phenotype. It is constructed by summing up an individual's alleles, weighted by effect sizes (betas) that are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n3.  **Why PGS Predictive Ability is Lower:** The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by the variance it explains (R²) in a new, independent dataset. This R² will necessarily be lower than the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) for several key reasons:\n    *   **Estimation Error:** The effect sizes used to build the PGS are estimated from a GWAS with a finite sample size. They are not the \"true\" effect sizes and contain statistical noise or error. This imperfection directly reduces the predictive accuracy of the score.\n    *   **Incomplete Model:** Most PGS methods involve some form of SNP selection (e.g., p-value thresholding) or statistical shrinkage (e.g., LDpred, PRS-CS). These models are approximations and do not perfectly capture the true, complex genetic architecture of the trait across all SNPs.\n    *   **Population Differences:** Minor differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, allele frequencies, or environmental factors between the GWAS discovery sample and the prediction target sample can further reduce the PGS accuracy.\n\nIn essence, SNP heritability is the theoretical potential, while the variance explained by a PGS is the realized, practical performance. Due to real-world limitations in estimating the underlying genetic effects, the practical performance will always fall short of the theoretical potential.\n\n<<<True>>>"
