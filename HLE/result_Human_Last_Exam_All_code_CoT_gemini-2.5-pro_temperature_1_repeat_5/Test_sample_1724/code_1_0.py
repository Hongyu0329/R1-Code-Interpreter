    """
    This function uses the Poincar√©-Lindstedt method to find the nonlinear
    frequency correction for the given Rayleigh-Plesset equation.
    
    The method involves expanding the solution and frequency in a perturbation series.
    By eliminating secular terms at each order, we can find the corrections to the
    oscillation frequency.

    The main nonlinear correction appears at the second order for the squared frequency,
    denoted as Omega_2. This function calculates Omega_2 as a polynomial in the
    polytropic index gamma and extracts the coefficient of the third term of this polynomial,
    which is the requested answer.
