    "My plan is to analyze the technical execution of a *cambré derrière* (a bend backward) in both the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods, focusing on the key principles that distinguish them. I will then evaluate the given multiple-choice options against this technical analysis to determine the most significant difference. The Vaganova method emphasizes maintaining a square and stable torso, with the movement initiating from the upper back. The Balanchine style often prioritizes creating long, dynamic lines, which can involve altering classical alignment. The most critical distinction in a *cambré derrière* is how the hips are used. I will create a Python script to print a clear explanation of this difference.\n\n```python\ndef explain_ballet_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the key difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n    \"\"\"\n    vaganova_principle = \"In the Vaganova method, a cambré derrière requires the dancer to keep the hips perfectly square to the direction they are facing. The bend initiates from the upper and middle back, emphasizing control, stability, and pure spinal flexibility without twisting the pelvis.\"\n\n    balanchine_principle = \"In the Balanchine method, achieving a more extreme and visually dynamic line is often prioritized. For a cambré derrière, the dancer is frequently permitted or encouraged to lift the hip of the gesture leg. This opening of the hip allows for a deeper-looking backbend and creates a sweeping, less frontal line.\"\n\n    conclusion = \"Therefore, the most fundamental technical difference between the two styles in this movement is the placement of the hip.\"\n\n    print(\"Vaganova Method:\")\n    print(f\"- {vaganova_principle}\\n\")\n    print(\"Balanchine Method:\")\n    print(f\"- {balanchine_principle}\\n\")\n    print(f\"Conclusion: {conclusion}\")\n\nexplain_ballet_difference()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
