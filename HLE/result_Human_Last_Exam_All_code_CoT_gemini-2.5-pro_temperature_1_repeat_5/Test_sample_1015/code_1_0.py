    vaganova_principle = "In the Vaganova method, a cambré derrière requires the dancer to keep the hips perfectly square to the direction they are facing. The bend initiates from the upper and middle back, emphasizing control, stability, and pure spinal flexibility without twisting the pelvis."

    balanchine_principle = "In the Balanchine method, achieving a more extreme and visually dynamic line is often prioritized. For a cambré derrière, the dancer is frequently permitted or encouraged to lift the hip of the gesture leg. This opening of the hip allows for a deeper-looking backbend and creates a sweeping, less frontal line."

    conclusion = "Therefore, the most fundamental technical difference between the two styles in this movement is the placement of the hip."
