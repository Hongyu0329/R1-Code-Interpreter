    "To determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners, I will focus on the batting Triple Crown, which is awarded to a player who leads their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs in a single season.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Create a list of all instances a player has won the Triple Crown, including the player's name and the year.\n2.  From this list, identify the unique players who have accomplished this feat.\n3.  Count the number of unique players.\n4.  Display the final count as an equation, listing each unique winner to show how the total is derived.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the number of unique MLB batting Triple Crown winners.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of tuples: (Player, Year) for each time the batting Triple Crown was won.\n    triple_crown_instances = [\n        (\"Paul Hines\", 1878),\n        (\"Tip O'Neill\", 1887),\n        (\"Hugh Duffy\", 1894),\n        (\"Nap Lajoie\", 1901),\n        (\"Ty Cobb\", 1909),\n        (\"Heinie Zimmerman\", 1912),\n        (\"Rogers Hornsby\", 1922),\n        (\"Rogers Hornsby\", 1925),\n        (\"Chuck Klein\", 1933),\n        (\"Jimmie Foxx\", 1933),\n        (\"Lou Gehrig\", 1934),\n        (\"Joe Medwick\", 1937),\n        (\"Ted Williams\", 1942),\n        (\"Ted Williams\", 1947),\n        (\"Mickey Mantle\", 1956),\n        (\"Frank Robinson\", 1966),\n        (\"Carl Yastrzemski\", 1967),\n        (\"Miguel Cabrera\", 2012),\n    ]\n\n    # Use a set to get the unique winners' names\n    unique_winners = sorted(list(set(player for player, year in triple_crown_instances)))\n    \n    num_unique_winners = len(unique_winners)\n\n    print(\"The unique MLB batting Triple Crown winners are:\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string\n    equation_parts = []\n    for winner in unique_winners:\n        # Each unique winner contributes 1 to the total count.\n        equation_parts.append(f\"1 ({winner})\")\n        \n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {num_unique_winners}\")\n    print(f\"\\nIn total, there have been {num_unique_winners} unique Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\")\n\ncount_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<16>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
