# Part (a): Condition for similarity
# Two matrices A and B are similar if and only if they have the same Jordan Normal Form.
# For a diagonalizable matrix, its Jordan form is the diagonal matrix containing its
# eigenvalues. A diagonal matrix is, by definition, diagonalizable.
# Therefore, two diagonal matrices A and B are similar if and only if they have the same
# eigenvalues with the same multiplicities. This means the diagonal entries of B are a
# permutation of the diagonal entries of A.

# Part (b): Number of classes for n=3 with distinct eigenvalues
# A similarity class of a diagonal matrix is uniquely determined by the multiset of its
# eigenvalues. If the eigenvalues are the three distinct values α, β, and γ,
# then the multiset of eigenvalues is fixed as {α, β, γ}. Since there is only one
# such multiset, there is only one similarity class.
answer_b = 1

# Part (c): Growth of the number of similarity classes
# The number of similarity classes is the number of ways to choose n eigenvalues
# from a field F of size q, with replacement and where order does not matter.
# This corresponds to the number of multisets of size n from a set of size q.
# The formula is C(n + q - 1, n). For a fixed q, this is a polynomial in n
# of degree q-1. Polynomial growth is not exponential.
