    "To solve this problem, we will find the ratio of the uncertainty in the electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its momentum ($p_1$) in the first Bohr orbit.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$)**: We use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. We will use the minimum uncertainty, so the equation becomes $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\cdot \\Delta x}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $\\Delta x$ is the given uncertainty in position.\n2.  **Calculate the momentum in the first Bohr orbit ($p_1$)**: According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum of an electron is quantized: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$. For the first orbit (n=1), the momentum is $p_1 = mv = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$, where $r_1$ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit, also known as the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n3.  **Find the ratio**: The required ratio is $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1}$. By substituting the expressions from the steps above, we get:\n    Ratio = $\\frac{\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\cdot \\Delta x}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\cdot \\Delta x}$\n4.  **Substitute the values and calculate**: We will use the known value for the Bohr radius ($a_0 \\approx 5.29177 \\times 10^{-11}$ m) and the given position uncertainty ($\\Delta x = 10$ pm = $10 \\times 10^{-12}$ m) to compute the final ratio.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical constants\n    # Bohr radius (a0) in meters\n    a0 = 5.29177210903e-11\n\n    # Given uncertainty in position in picometers\n    delta_x_pm = 10.0\n\n    # Convert position uncertainty from picometers to meters\n    # 1 pm = 1e-12 m\n    delta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12\n\n    # The ratio is derived from (hbar / (2 * delta_x)) / (hbar / a0),\n    # which simplifies to a0 / (2 * delta_x).\n    ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x_m)\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the ratio of momentum uncertainty to momentum for an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\")\n    print(\"The formula for the ratio simplifies to: a0 / (2 * delta_x)\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Bohr Radius (a0): {a0} m\")\n    print(f\"Position Uncertainty (delta_x): {delta_x_m} m\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {a0} / (2 * {delta_x_m})\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_momentum_ratio()\n<<<2.645886054515>>>"
