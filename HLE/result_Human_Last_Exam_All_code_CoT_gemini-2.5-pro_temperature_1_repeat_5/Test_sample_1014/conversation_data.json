    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will use a method called trial division. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  I will write a Python script that systematically checks for prime factors.\n3.  The script will first check for divisibility by 2.\n4.  Then, it will check for divisibility by all odd numbers (`d = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the remaining number `n`.\n5.  Whenever a factor `d` is found, I will divide `n` by `d` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible, adding `d` to a list of factors each time.\n6.  If, after checking all numbers up to its square root, the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this remaining value is itself a prime factor (and will be the largest one).\n7.  Finally, the script will print the complete prime factorization equation and then identify the largest number from that list of factors.\n\nThis approach ensures we find all prime factors and can thus easily determine the largest one.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds all prime factors of a number n using trial division,\n    prints the factorization equation, and identifies the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor 2. If n is even, divide by 2 until it's odd.\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors. We check for odd divisors from 3 up to sqrt(n).\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n        i += 2\n\n    # If n is still greater than 1 after the loop, the remaining n must be prime.\n    # This is the case if the original number was prime, or it's the last remaining prime factor.\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # If the original number was 0, 1, or negative, it has no prime divisors.\n    if not factors:\n        print(f\"The number {original_n} has no prime divisors.\")\n        return\n\n    # As requested, print the prime factorization equation.\n    # If the number is prime, the equation will be \"n = n\".\n    print(f\"{original_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\")\n\n    # The largest prime factor is simply the maximum value in our list of factors.\n    largest_prime = max(factors)\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor of {original_n} is: {largest_prime}\")\n\n# The number we need to analyze\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\n\n# Run the function to get the answer\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factor)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
