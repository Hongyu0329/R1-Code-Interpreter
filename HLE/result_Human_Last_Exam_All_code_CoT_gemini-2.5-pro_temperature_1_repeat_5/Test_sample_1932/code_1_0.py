def solve_hourglass_weight_change():
    """
    This function formulates the expression for the change in weight of a running hourglass.

    The change in weight is estimated by considering the largest effect influencing it.
    This analysis concludes that the largest effect is the initial decrease in weight
    as the first stream of sand falls before any impact occurs.

    The change in weight Delta_W is given by the negative of the weight of the sand column
    in flight just before the first impact. Delta_W = -m_dot * sqrt(2*g*H).
    m_dot is the mass flow rate, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and H is the
    fall height.

    The mass flow rate m_dot = M_sand / t, where M_sand is the total mass of the
    sand and t is the total time.
    M_sand = rho * V = rho * (pi * d**2 / 4 * h).
    So, m_dot = (pi * d**2 * h * rho) / (4 * t).

    Substituting m_dot into the expression for Delta_W gives the final formula.
