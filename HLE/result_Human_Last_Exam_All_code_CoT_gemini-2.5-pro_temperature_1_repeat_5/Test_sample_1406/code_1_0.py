    print("A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.")
    print("A space S is continuum-connected if any two points in S are contained in a continuum within S.")

    print("----------------------------")
    print("For n=1, we consider the 1-cube, which is the interval [0,1].")
    print("We need to see if there exists a continuum X such that its set of non-block points, N(X), is [0,1].")
    print("Consider the topologist's sine curve, X = {(x, sin(1/x)) | x in (0, 1]} U {(0, y) | y in [-1, 1]}.")
    print("This space X is a continuum.")
    print("The set of non-block points of X is the segment on the y-axis, L = {(0, y) | y in [-1, 1]}.")
    print("This set L is homeomorphic to the interval [0,1].")
    print("Therefore, for n=1, the n-cube [0,1]^1 can occur as the set of non-block points.\n")

    print("Step 3: Analysis for n >= 2")
    print("----------------------------")
    print("For n>=2, let's consider the n-cube [0,1]^n as the continuum X itself. So, X = [0,1]^n.")

    print("Let's analyze the set S = X \\ {p} = [0,1]^n \\ {p}.")
    print("For any n >= 2, the space S is path-connected. For any two points x, y in S, there is a path (a continuous function from [0,1]) connecting them that lies entirely within S.")
    print("Any path is the continuous image of [0,1], which is compact and connected. Thus, the image of a path is a continuum.")
    print("Since any two points in S can be connected by a path within S, S is continuum-connected.")
    print("Now, we can choose the subset D to be S itself. D=S is continuum-connected and it is dense in S.")
    print("This means that every point p in [0,1]^n (for n>=2) is a non-block point.")
    print("Therefore, the set of non-block points of [0,1]^n is [0,1]^n itself. N([0,1]^n) = [0,1]^n for n >= 2.")
    print("So, for n>=2, the n-cube can occur as the set of non-block points.\n")
    
    print("Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("------------------")
    print("We have shown that:")
    print(" - For n=1, [0,1]^1 can occur as the set of non-block points.")
    print(" - For all n>=2, [0,1]^n can occur as the set of non-block points.")
    print("Combining these results, the n-cube [0,1]^n can occur as the set of non-block points for all positive integers n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n")

    print("Step 5: Final Answer")
    print("--------------------")
    print("The question asks for how many n does the n-cube FAIL to occur.")
