    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For non-interacting or weakly coupled systems, the Chern number of a combined system is simply the sum of the Chern numbers of its individual parts.\n2.  **Define Variables:** I will define variables for the Chern number of each insulator, `C1` and `C2`.\n3.  **Perform Calculation:** I will calculate the total Chern number, `C_total`, by adding `C1` and `C2`.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that performs this calculation and prints the full equation and the final result, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the Chern number of the junction.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern number for each of the two insulators.\nC1 = 1\nC2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of a junction of two topological insulators is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Display the calculation and the result.\n# The final line shows the full equation with the numbers substituted.\nprint(\"The Chern number of the first insulator is C1 = 1\")\nprint(\"The Chern number of the second insulator is C2 = 1\")\nprint(\"The total Chern number of the junction is C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the calculation is: {C1} + {C2} = {C_total}\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is: {C_total}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
