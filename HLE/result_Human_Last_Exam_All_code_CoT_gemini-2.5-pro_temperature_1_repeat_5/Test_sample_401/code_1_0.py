# This is a theoretical question from point-set topology.
# The answer is derived from established mathematical theorems, not from computation.
# The Python code below will simply state and print the final answer based on the reasoning.

# Step 1: An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.
# This means the number must be greater than 1.
minimum_is_at_least = 2

# Step 2: Examples of non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly two
# composants have been constructed by topologists.
# This confirms that the number 2 is achievable.
smallest_known_example = 2

# Step 3: Combining these facts, the smallest possible number is 2.
smallest_number_of_composants = 2

# Final Answer
print("Based on established theorems in point-set topology:")
print("The smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is:")
print(smallest_number_of_composants)
