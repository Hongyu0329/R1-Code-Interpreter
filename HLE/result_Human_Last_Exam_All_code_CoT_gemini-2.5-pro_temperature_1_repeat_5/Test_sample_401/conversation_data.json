    "This is a fascinating and deep question from the field of point-set topology. The answer depends crucially on the phrase \"not necessarily metric\". I will walk through the reasoning that leads to the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the key terms**: I will first clarify the definitions of a continuum, an indecomposable continuum, and a composant.\n2.  **Analyze the constraints**: The core of the problem lies in understanding the properties of these topological objects and how they differ between metric and non-metric spaces.\n3.  **Eliminate possibilities**: I'll show why an indecomposable continuum cannot have only one composant.\n4.  **Establish the minimum**: I'll refer to known results in topology that demonstrate the existence of indecomposable continua with a specific small number of composants, which will establish the minimum possible number.\n5.  **Provide the code**: Since this is a theoretical question, the python code will simply print the final answer based on the mathematical reasoning.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n*   A **continuum** is a compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space.\n*   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its own proper subcontinua (a proper subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum, but is not the whole space).\n*   A **composant** of a point `p` in a continuum `X` is the set of all points `x` for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` that contains both `p` and `x`. The continuum is the union of its composants, and these composants are pairwise disjoint.\n*   It can be proven that an indecomposable continuum must have **more than one composant**. If it had only one, that single composant would have to be the entire space. But a key theorem states that in an indecomposable continuum, every composant is a *proper* subset of the space, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the minimum number is at least 2.\n*   For **metric** spaces (like those embeddable in Euclidean space), a famous theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that every indecomposable metric continuum has uncountably many composants.\n*   However, the question specifies \"not necessarily metric\". This opens up other possibilities. In the realm of non-metric topology, examples have been constructed that behave differently. Topologists like David P. Bellamy have constructed examples of indecomposable (Hausdorff) continua that have exactly **two** composants. Other examples exist for any finite number `n â‰¥ 2` and for a countably infinite number of composants.\n\nSince an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant, and examples with exactly two are known to exist, the smallest possible number is 2.\n\n```python\n# This is a theoretical question from point-set topology.\n# The answer is derived from established mathematical theorems, not from computation.\n# The Python code below will simply state and print the final answer based on the reasoning.\n\n# Step 1: An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n# This means the number must be greater than 1.\nminimum_is_at_least = 2\n\n# Step 2: Examples of non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly two\n# composants have been constructed by topologists.\n# This confirms that the number 2 is achievable.\nsmallest_known_example = 2\n\n# Step 3: Combining these facts, the smallest possible number is 2.\nsmallest_number_of_composants = 2\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(\"Based on established theorems in point-set topology:\")\nprint(\"The smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is:\")\nprint(smallest_number_of_composants)\n```\n<<<2>>>"
