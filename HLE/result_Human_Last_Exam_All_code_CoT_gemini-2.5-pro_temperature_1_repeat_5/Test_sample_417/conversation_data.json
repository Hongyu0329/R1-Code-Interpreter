    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry to count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring with three identical, large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule C3 rotational symmetry. Due to this symmetry, we only need to count the unique proton environments on the central core and on a single one of the three identical arms.\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** Identify the unique proton signals originating from the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n3.  **Count Signals from One Arm:** Analyze one of the complex chiral substituents to identify all its unique proton environments. The substituent is chiral and rigid, which means geminal protons (protons on the same CH2 group) or geminal methyl groups will be chemically different (diastereotopic).\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of signals from the core and the signals from one arm.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by calculating the number of signals from each part of the molecule and summing them up.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its symmetry and structure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the central core (2,4,6-trimethylbenzene).\n    # The three methyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's C3 symmetry.\n    # The other ring positions are substituted, so there are no aromatic protons.\n    signals_from_core = 1\n    print(f\"Number of signals from the central core's methyl groups: {signals_from_core}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze one of the three identical substituent arms.\n    # The arm is chiral, so we must consider diastereotopicity.\n\n    # 2a. The benzylic methylene linker (-CH2-):\n    # Its two protons are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral system.\n    signals_from_linker = 2\n    print(f\"Number of signals from the linker -CH2- group: {signals_from_linker}\")\n\n    # 2b. The proton on the pyrazole ring (part of the indazole system):\n    # There is one unique proton on the five-membered pyrazole ring.\n    signals_from_pyrazole_H = 1\n    print(f\"Number of signals from the pyrazole ring proton: {signals_from_pyrazole_H}\")\n\n    # 2c. The methyl groups on the rigid bicyclic frame:\n    # - One unique methyl group at position C7.\n    # - Two diastereotopic methyl groups at position C8.\n    signals_from_camphor_Me = 1 + 2\n    print(f\"Number of signals from the three methyl groups on the bicyclic frame: {signals_from_camphor_Me}\")\n\n    # 2d. The CH and CH2 protons on the rigid bicyclic frame:\n    # - One unique bridgehead proton at C4.\n    # - Two diastereotopic protons on the C5 methylene group.\n    # - Two diastereotopic protons on the C6 methylene group.\n    signals_from_camphor_frame_protons = 1 + 2 + 2\n    print(f\"Number of signals from the CH/CH2 protons on the bicyclic frame: {signals_from_camphor_frame_protons}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Sum the signals from one arm.\n    signals_from_one_arm = signals_from_linker + signals_from_pyrazole_H + signals_from_camphor_Me + signals_from_camphor_frame_protons\n    print(f\"\\nTotal signals from one substituent arm: {signals_from_one_arm}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of signals for the entire molecule.\n    total_signals = signals_from_core + signals_from_one_arm\n    \n    print(\"\\nTotal expected 1H NMR peaks = (signals from core) + (signals from one arm)\")\n    # Final equation as requested, showing each number\n    print(f\"{signals_from_core} + {signals_from_one_arm} = {total_signals}\")\n\ncalculate_nmr_peaks()\n```\n<<<H>>>"
