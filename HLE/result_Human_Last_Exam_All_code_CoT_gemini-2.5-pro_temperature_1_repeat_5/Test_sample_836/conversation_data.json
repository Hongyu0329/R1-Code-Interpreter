    "Of course. The physical quantity you are asking about is a cornerstone of nuclear reactor noise analysis. It provides deep insight into the dynamic behavior and stability of a neutron-multiplying system.\n\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function `G(r, t)` is known in the nuclear criticality community as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**. It is often denoted as `S(k, ω)` or `Φ(k, ω)`, where `k` is the spatial wavevector and `ω` is the angular frequency. This function quantifies the fluctuation power of the neutron population at different frequencies and spatial modes.\n\nMy plan is to provide you with a Python script that calculates this Power Spectral Density. The calculation is based on a one-speed neutron diffusion model, which captures the essential physics.\n\n1.  I will define a function that accepts the wavevector `k`, the frequency `ω`, and a set of typical reactor physics parameters.\n2.  Within this function, it will compute the components of the reactor transfer function, `H(k, ω)`.\n3.  The PSD is then calculated using the formula: `PSD(k, ω) = SourceStrength * |H(k, ω)|²`.\n4.  As you requested, the script will print the numerical values for each major component of the final equation, offering a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_power_spectral_density(k, omega, params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Power Spectral Density (PSD) for a given wavenumber k and frequency omega.\n\n    The PSD is the double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function and is\n    calculated as PSD(k, ω) = |H(k, ω)|² * Q, where H is the reactor transfer\n    function and Q is the noise source strength.\n\n    Args:\n        k (float): The spatial wavenumber (in 1/m).\n        omega (float): The angular frequency (in rad/s).\n        params (dict): A dictionary of reactor physics parameters.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The value of the Power Spectral Density.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Complex number i\n    i = 1j\n\n    # Unpack parameters for clarity\n    v = params['v']\n    D = params['D']\n    Sigma_a = params['Sigma_a']\n    nu = params['nu']\n    Sigma_f = params['Sigma_f']\n    beta_i = np.array(params['beta_i'])\n    lambda_i = np.array(params['lambda_i'])\n    chi = params['chi']\n    F = params['F']\n\n    print(f\"--- Calculating PSD for k = {k:.4f} 1/m and omega = {omega:.4f} rad/s ---\")\n\n    # 1.
