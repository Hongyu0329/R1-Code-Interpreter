The matrix elements `$\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$` are zero for all Slater determinants `|Î¦_I>` that are **quintuply-excited, sextuply-excited, and all higher levels of excitation**. This is because the two-body nature of the electronic Hamiltonian limits the `exp(-T) H exp(T)` operator, when acting on the reference determinant, to creating a state that has components no higher than quadruply-excited determinants. Projections onto any higher-level determinants are therefore zero by orthogonality.
