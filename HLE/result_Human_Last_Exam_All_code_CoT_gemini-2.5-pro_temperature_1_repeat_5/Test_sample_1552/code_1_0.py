# Plan:
# 1. Define the parameters from the Chamseddine-Connes formula.
#    - tau for a single Dirac fermion.
#    - The dimension of the spinor space (number of spinor components).
#    - The pre-factor from the formula.
# 2. Calculate the coefficient for the full fiber trace Tr_F(F^2).
# 3. Convert this to the coefficient for the gauge trace tr_g(F^2).
# 4. Print the final coefficient along with the numbers used in the calculation.

# Parameter for a single Dirac fermion
tau = -1/3

# Pre-factor from the a_2 formula
pre_factor = 1/4

# Dimension of the Dirac spinor space in 4D
spinor_dim = 4

# The coefficient 'c' in the equation a_2_gauge = c * Integral(Tr_F(F^2))
coeff_Tr_F = pre_factor * tau
# Tr_F(F^2) = spinor_dim * tr_g(F^2)
# The coefficient 'C_F' for the term with tr_g(F^2) is therefore:
coeff_tr_g = coeff_Tr_F * spinor_dim

# The final equation for the coefficient C_F is: C_F = (1/4) * tau * spinor_dim
print(f"The equation for the coefficient is: C_F = pre_factor * tau * spinor_dim")
print(f"Using the values:")
print(f"pre_factor = {pre_factor}")
print(f"tau = {tau}")
print(f"spinor_dim = {spinor_dim}")
print(f"The final coefficient for the tr_g(F_munu * F^munu) term is: {coeff_tr_g}")
