1. The question asks for the *initial* defense mechanism against oxidative stress caused by high temperature (29°C) in a specific cyanobacterium strain.
2. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance of damaging Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).
3. A key study by Lopes, Vilas-Boas, et al. (2020) in 'Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety' directly investigated this exact strain and temperature.
4. The study's title is: "Initial response of Microcystis aeruginosa CAAT 2005-3 to high temperature exposure involves the activation of enzymatic antioxidants".
5. The researchers found that the cells promptly activated the enzymes Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) to detoxify the ROS.
6. SOD and CAT are primary examples of 'Enzymatic antioxidants'. This confirms that the initial response is enzymatic.
