    "This is a tricky question, as the specific sequence of events you describe doesn't happen exactly that way in a single, well-known Oscar-nominated film. It's likely a memory combining elements from different movies.\n\nHowever, the film that best fits the key elements of your question (Oscar nomination, a \"thank you,\" a bus, and a sealed fate) is **Babel (2006)**.\n\nHere is the plan to explain why:\n1.  In one of the film's intersecting storylines, a Japanese businessman gives his hunting rifle to his Moroccan guide as a \"thank you\" gift.\n2.  The guide's young sons later use this rifle and accidentally shoot an American tourist (played by Cate Blanchett) who is traveling on a tour bus.\n3.  This single event, which originates from a \"thank you,\" sets off a tragic chain reaction that seals the fate of multiple characters across different continents.\n\nWhile a character doesn't literally say the words \"Thank you\" while getting on the bus, the \"thank you\" gift is the direct cause of the tragic events that happen on the bus.\n\nHere is a Python script to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_title():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the movie based on a description of its plot elements.\n\n    The film is likely \"Babel\" (2006), which was nominated for seven Academy Awards.\n    A pivotal plot point involves a rifle, given as a \"thank you\" present,\n    which is later used to accidentally shoot a passenger on a tour bus.\n    This act seals the tragic fate of many of the film's characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"Babel\"\n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film is most likely: {movie_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_title()\n```\n<<<Babel>>>"
