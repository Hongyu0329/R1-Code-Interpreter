    # The scenario describes a conflict of interest where a law firm (NC LLP) is representing a client (Six Wings Inc.)
    # in a matter against a former client (Advanced Tech Inc.).
    #
    # Key Facts:
    # 1. NC LLP possesses confidential information of the former client (Advanced Tech) that is highly relevant to the new matter (the acquisition).
    # 2. This creates a conflict of interest.
    # 3. The former client, Advanced Tech, explicitly refuses to consent to NC LLP's continued representation of Six Wings.
    #
    # Legal Principle: In situations involving a conflict of interest with a former client,
    # the lawyer or firm can typically only continue to act if they obtain informed consent from that former client.
    # The absence of consent is a critical barrier.
    #
    # Analysis of Options:
    # A: Incorrect. The matters are related because the confidential information is relevant.
    # B: Incorrect. Ethical walls are not sufficient on their own; consent is required.
    # C: A contributing factor, but not the primary legal reason. The fundamental issue is the lack of consent.
    # D: Correct. This choice accurately states the core legal principle that applies. The lack of consent from the prejudiced party (Advanced Tech) prevents NC LLP from acting.
    # E: Incorrect. This is an overgeneralization; consent can sometimes resolve conflicts.
    
    answer = 'D'
    explanation = "Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because, when a conflict exists, the party prejudiced by the conflicted lawyer acting must consent to this lawyer acting for such lawyer to continue representing a party to the matter."
