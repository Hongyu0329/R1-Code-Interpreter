    Analyzes statements about attack graph analysis to find the incorrect one.

    A. Correct. Attack graphs are directed graphs, and graph theory algorithms are used for analysis.
    B. Correct. The state explosion problem is a key challenge, leading to exponential graph sizes.
    C. Incorrect. Attack graph generation is a function problem, not a decision problem, so it is not technically NP-hard. NP-hardness is a property of decision problems. While related analysis problems (like reachability) are hard (NP-complete or PSPACE-complete) and generation takes exponential time, the classification of the generation problem itself as NP-hard is a category error.
    D. Correct. Systems change, so attack graphs must be updated, often using incremental techniques.
    E. Correct. Attack graphs are used for formal verification, for example, with model checking.

    The only clearly incorrect statement is C.
