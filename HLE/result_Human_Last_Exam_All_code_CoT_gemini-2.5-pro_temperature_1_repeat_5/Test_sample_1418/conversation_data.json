    "To find the Galois group of $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the structure of the extension:** We build the extension field $L$ by first considering the biquadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ and then adjoining the element $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\n2.  **Determine the degree of the extension:** We calculate the degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. We know $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. We find $[L:K]$ by checking if $\\gamma = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $K$.\n3.  **Identify the Galois Group:** Once the degree is known, we analyze the structure of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. We will define the automorphisms that generate the group and determine the relations between them. By examining the group's properties, specifically the number of elements of each order, we can identify it among the possible groups of that order.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these steps symbolically.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the Galois group of L/Q where\n    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the field and its generators.\")\n    s2 = sympy.sqrt(2)\n    s3 = sympy.sqrt(3)\n    gamma = (2 + s2) * (3 + s3)\n    # We use a symbol for the outer radical to handle expressions in L\n    alpha = sympy.Symbol('alpha')\n    # The defining relation for alpha is alpha**2 = gamma\n    print(f\"The field is L = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), alpha) where alpha^2 = {gamma.expand()}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension [L:Q].\")\n    # The degree is [L:K][K:Q] where K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n    # [K:Q] = 4.\n    # [L:K] is 2 if gamma is not a square in K, and 1 otherwise.\n    # We check if gamma is a square in K by checking if its norm from K to Q(sqrt(2))\n    # is a square in Q(sqrt(2)).\n    \n    # In K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), gamma = (6+3*s2) + (2+s2)*s3\n    a = 6 + 3*s2\n    b = 2 + s2\n    # Norm_{K/Q(sqrt(2))}(gamma) = a^2 - 3*b^2\n    norm_gamma = (a**2 - 3 * b**2).expand()\n    print(f\"The norm of gamma from K to Q(sqrt(2)) is: {norm_gamma}\")\n\n    # Helper function to check if an element x + y*sqrt(d) is a square in Q(sqrt(d))\n    def is_square_in_Q_sqrt_d(expr, d):\n        # expr = x + y*sqrt(d)\n        s_d = sympy.sqrt(d)\n        y = expr.coeff(s_d)\n        x = expr.coeff(s_d, 0)\n        \n        # Check if x^2 - d*y^2 is a square in Q\n        norm_sq = (x**2 - d*y**2)\n        if not norm_sq.is_rational or sympy.sqrt(norm_sq).is_rational is False:\n            return False\n        \n        # Check if 2*(x + sqrt(x^2 - d*y^2)) is a square in Q\n        sqrt_norm = sympy.sqrt(norm_sq)\n        term1 = 2 * (x + sqrt_norm)\n        if term1 >= 0 and (not term1.is_rational or sympy.sqrt(term1).is_rational is False):\n             # check the other sign\n             term2 = 2 * (x - sqrt_norm)\n             if term2 >= 0 and (not term2.is_rational or sympy.sqrt(term2).is_rational is False):\n                 return False\n        return True\n\n    is_sq = is_square_in_Q_sqrt_d(norm_gamma, 2)\n    print(f\"Is the norm a square in Q(sqrt(2))? {is_sq}\")\n    if not is_sq:\n        degree = 8\n        print(\"Since the norm is not a square, gamma is not a square in K.\")\n        print(\"[L:K] = 2.
