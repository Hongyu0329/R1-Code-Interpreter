def find_true_statements():
  """
  This function identifies the correct statements regarding the junction tree algorithm.
  The analysis is as follows:
  - A: False. Approximate inference can be more efficient.
  - B: False. It is not resilient to high treewidth.
  - C: True. Nodes are cliques holding joint distributions (potentials).
  - D: False. The premise ("is resilient") is false.
  - E: True. High treewidth makes it impractical.
  - F: False. Same as D.
  - G: True. The use of joint distributions over large cliques (from high treewidth) is the reason it's not resilient.
  - H: False. The relationship is exponential, not linear.
  - I: True. This correctly describes the exponential complexity.
  - J: False. Efficiency is highly dependent on clique size.
  - L: True. This is a correct characterization of the running intersection property.
  
  The final list of true statements is {C, E, G, I, L}.
