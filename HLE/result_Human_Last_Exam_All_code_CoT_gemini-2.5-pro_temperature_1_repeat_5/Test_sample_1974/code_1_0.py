    print("The statement 'D has no solution' is a Π₁ arithmetic statement. The question is about the number of true Π₁ statements that can be decided by adding a single new axiom 'ψ' to ZFC.")

    print("Since ψ is independent, there exists a countable transitive model M where ψ is false. It is a standard result in set theory that one can then find a generic extension M[G] where ψ is forced to be true. This matches the problem's setup.")

    print("\nStep 5: Conclude the cardinality")
    print("We have found a suitable ψ. For this ψ, the set S contains a Diophantine equation corresponding to each φ_n.")
    print("This means the cardinality of S is at least countably infinite (Aleph-null, ℵ₀).")
    print("The set of all possible Diophantine equations is itself only countably infinite.")
    print("Therefore, the cardinality of S can be no more than countably infinite.")
    print("Combining these, the maximum possible cardinality of S is countably infinite.")

    print("\nStep 6: Final Answer Formulation")
    print("The maximum cardinality is ℵ₀ (Aleph-null).")
    print("To satisfy the prompt's requirement of an equation with numbers, here is a representative equation where the result corresponds to the subscript in the symbol ℵ₀:")
