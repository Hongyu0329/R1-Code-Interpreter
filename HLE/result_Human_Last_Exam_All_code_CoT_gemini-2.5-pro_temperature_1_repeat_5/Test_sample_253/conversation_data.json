    "To solve this problem, we will simulate a one-dimensional cellular automaton following Rule 110.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Rule 110**: A cell's next state is determined by its current state and the states of its left and right neighbors. The rule is defined by the binary representation of 110, which is `01101110`. This binary string gives the output for the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns, ordered from `111` down to `000`:\n    *   `111` -> `0`\n    *   `110` -> `1`\n    *   `101` -> `1`\n    *   `100` -> `0`\n    *   `011` -> `1`\n    *   `010` -> `1`\n    *   `001` -> `1`\n    *   `000` -> `0`\n\n2.  **Simulation Setup**:\n    *   **Grid**: We'll use a 1D list of cells, wide enough to contain the pattern's growth over 20 iterations. A width of 81 cells is more than sufficient.\n    *   **Initial State**: The simulation starts with a single cell in state `1` at the center of the grid, with all other cells in state `0`.\n    *   **Iterations**: We will apply Rule 110 for 20 steps (generations).\n    *   **Boundary Conditions**: We assume cells outside the grid are always in state `0` (fixed boundary).\n\n3.  **Execution**:\n    *   We'll create a Python script to perform the simulation.\n    *   The script will initialize the grid and then loop 20 times. In each iteration, it computes the next generation based on the current one using the Rule 110 logic.\n    *   After 20 iterations, the script will isolate the significant part of the resulting pattern (by trimming the leading and trailing zeros) and print it.\n\n4.  **Final Output**:\n    *   The code will print the final binary pattern as a sequence of space-separated numbers.\n    *   The final answer will be provided in the format `<<<answer>>>`, containing the same binary pattern as a single string.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_rule110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates Rule 110 for 20 generations starting from a single '1' cell.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Simulation Parameters ---\n    generations = 20\n    # Use a width that is large enough to contain the pattern's growth.\n    # The pattern grows at most 1 cell per side per generation.\n    # Width = 2 * generations + some padding\n    width = 81\n\n    # --- Rule 110 Definition ---\n    # The rule is defined by the binary representation of 110 -> 01101110\n    # (neighborhood_pattern) -> next_state\n    rule110 = {\n        (1, 1, 1): 0,\n        (1, 1, 0): 1,\n        (1, 0, 1): 1,\n        (1, 0, 0): 0,\n        (0, 1, 1): 1,\n        (0, 1, 0): 1,\n        (0, 0, 1): 1,\n        (0, 0, 0): 0\n    }\n\n    # --- Initial State ---\n    # A single '1' in the center of a line of '0's.\n    cells = [0] * width\n    cells[width // 2] = 1\n\n    # --- Simulation Loop ---\n    for _ in range(generations):\n        next_cells = [0] * width\n        # Iterate through the interior cells.
