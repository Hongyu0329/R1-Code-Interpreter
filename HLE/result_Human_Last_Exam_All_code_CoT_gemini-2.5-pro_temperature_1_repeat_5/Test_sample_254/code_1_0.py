    print("A valid and reliable NMA result depends on several interconnected assumptions being met.")
    print("The question is whether satisfying just one of these is enough.")
    print("\nLet's consider the relationships:")
    print("1. Transitivity (A) and Similarity of Effect Modifiers (D) are closely related. Transitivity is the fundamental qualitative assumption that you can compare A vs C indirectly. This is only plausible if the patient populations and trial protocols (i.e., effect modifiers) are similar enough across the A vs B and B vs C trials.")
    print("2. Consistency (B) is the statistical manifestation of transitivity. It checks if the direct evidence (from A-vs-C trials) agrees with the indirect evidence (calculated from A-vs-B and B-vs-C trials).")
    print("3. Homogeneity (C) is the assumption that within a specific comparison (e.g., within all A-vs-B trials), the treatment effect is similar.")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("No single assumption is sufficient. For example:")
    print("- You could have statistical consistency (B), but if the studies lack transitivity (A/D), the result is meaningless ('consistently biased').")
    print("- You could have homogeneity (C) in all pairwise comparisons, but the network could still be inconsistent (violating B).")
    print("- The study populations could appear transitive (A/D), but statistical inconsistency (violating B) could still arise by chance or due to unmeasured factors.")
    print("\nTherefore, the validity of an NMA requires a holistic assessment of all these assumptions. No single condition is sufficient on its own.")
