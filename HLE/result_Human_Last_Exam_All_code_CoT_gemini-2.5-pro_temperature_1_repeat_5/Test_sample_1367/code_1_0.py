    # (a) Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_{>=1}?
    # The vertex algebra V(p) = ker(Q) is known to be simple if and only if p=1.
    # For p > 1, it contains a non-trivial ideal, making it non-simple.
    answer_a = "No"

    # (b) If a non-trivial ideal exists in V(p), what condition must it meet?
    # An ideal in the vertex algebra V(p) must be closed under the action of all elements of V(p).
    # Since V(p) contains L_k(sl_2) as a subalgebra, the ideal must be a module for L_k(sl_2).
    # Furthermore, any non-trivial submodule (and thus ideal) in this context is generated by
    # a singular vector. Therefore, both conditions are necessary.
    answer_b = "Both"

    # (c) Does the simplicity of V(p) imply that it is also irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
    # Yes. If V(p) were reducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module, it would contain a non-trivial submodule.
    # This submodule would then generate a proper non-trivial ideal in V(p), which contradicts
    # the assumption that V(p) is simple. Thus, simplicity as a vertex algebra implies
    # irreducibility as a module for the affine subalgebra.
    answer_c = "Yes"
