    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating problem from the field of algebraic combinatorics. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve it, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Theorem:** The problem asks for the number of certain combinatorial structures (\"non-collapsing rooted forests\") on a topological space (the Möbius band). A powerful theorem by Gil Kalai connects this combinatorial quantity to well-known topological and graph-theoretic invariants. The formula is:\n    *N = (Sum of Betti numbers) × (Number of spanning trees)*\n\n2.  **Calculate the Sum of Betti Numbers:** The Betti numbers ($\\beta_i$) are topological invariants that, in simple terms, count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions in a space. They are the same for any valid triangulation of the Möbius band.\n    *   $\\beta_0 = 1$ (the space is connected).\n    *   $\\beta_1 = 1$ (it has one essential loop, the \"core\" circle).\n    *   $\\beta_i = 0$ for all $i \\ge 2$.\n    *   The sum is $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + ... = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n3.  **Identify the \"Standard Triangulation\" and its 1-Skeleton:** The phrase \"standard triangulation\" usually implies the most fundamental or minimal one. For the Möbius band, the minimal triangulation (the one with the fewest vertices) requires 5 vertices. The graph formed by the vertices and edges (the \"1-skeleton\") of this triangulation is the **complete graph on 5 vertices ($K_5$)**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Spanning Trees:** We need to find the number of spanning trees for the graph $K_5$. A famous result in graph theory, Cayley's formula, gives the number of spanning trees for any complete graph $K_n$ as $n^{n-2}$.\n    *   For $K_5$, this is $5^{(5-2)} = 5^3 = 125$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Answer:** Multiply the results from steps 2 and 4 to get the final count.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mobius_forests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests on the standard\n    triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to simplicially collapse\n    onto the root.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: The solution relies on a theorem by Kalai.\n    # N = (sum of Betti numbers) * (number of spanning trees of the 1-skeleton)\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the sum of Betti numbers for the Möbius band.\n    # beta_0 = 1 (for one connected component)\n    # beta_1 = 1 (for the central loop)\n    # All other Betti numbers are 0.\n    sum_betti_numbers = 1 + 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Identify the 1-skeleton of the standard (minimal) triangulation.\n    # The minimal triangulation of the Möbius band uses n=5 vertices, and its\n    # 1-skeleton is the complete graph K_n.\n    n_vertices = 5\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the number of spanning trees for the K_5 graph\n    # using Cayley's formula: n^(n-2).\n    num_spanning_trees = n_vertices ** (n_vertices - 2)\n    \n    # Step 5: Compute the final result.\n    total_forests = sum_betti_numbers * num_spanning_trees\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation.\n    print(\"To solve this, we use a key theorem from algebraic combinatorics.\")\n    print(\"The number of non-collapsing rooted forests is the product of two values:\")\n    print(\"1.
