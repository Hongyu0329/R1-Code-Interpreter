    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor N**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi_q$ where $q$ are the prime power factors of $N$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_q$ is primitive with conductor $q$.\n2.  **Analyze character properties**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_q$. We need this lcm to be 6.\n3.  **Count characters for each factor**: For each prime power factor $q$ of $N$, we will count the number of primitive characters $\\chi_q$ whose order divides 6.\n4.  **Combine results**: We will multiply the counts from each factor to get the total number of combinations of component characters whose orders all divide 6.\n5.  **Apply lcm condition**: We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion (or complementary counting) to ensure the lcm of the orders is exactly 6. This requires the lcm to be divisible by 2 and 3.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given\n    conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    ORDER_WANTED = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {ORDER_WANTED}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Factor N\n    # N = 36036 = 36 * 1001 = (2^2 * 3^2) * (7 * 11 * 13)\n    prime_powers = [4, 9, 7, 11, 13]\n    \n    print(f\"The conductor N factorizes into prime powers: {prime_powers}\")\n    print(\"A character is primitive of conductor N if and only if it is a product of primitive characters with conductors from this set.\")\n    print(\"The order of the character is the lcm of the orders of its components.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: For each component, find the number of primitive characters whose order divides 6.\n    print(f\"We analyze each component to find primitive characters whose order divides {ORDER_WANTED}:\")\n    \n    counts = {}\n\n    # Component q=4 (2^2)\n    # The group of characters mod 4 is cyclic of order phi(4)=2.\n    # The number of primitive characters is phi(4) - phi(2) = 1.
