    # --- Facts from the problem description ---
    # Fact 1: CA biotype (watermelon-adapted) thrives on a high-raffinose diet.
    # Fact 2: MA biotype (cotton-adapted) thrives on a sucrose-only diet.
    # Fact 3: Raffinose is an RFO (Raffinose Family Oligosaccharide).
    # Fact 4: Galactosidase is the enzyme that metabolizes raffinose.
    # Fact 5: Host transfer moves CA to cotton and MA to watermelon.
    
    # --- Inferences ---
    # Inference 1: Watermelon is likely high in raffinose.
    # Inference 2: Cotton is likely high in sucrose and low in raffinose.
    
    # --- Evaluating the statements ---
    
    # A. CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.
    # Reasoning: True. CA is adapted to raffinose (an RFO), MA is not.
    is_A_true = True
    
    # B. CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.
    # Reasoning: True. The text states they "did well on" these respective diets.
    is_B_true = True
    
    # C. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, 
    #    owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.
    # Reasoning: True. Lower substrate (raffinose) leads to lower enzyme activity (substrate induction).
    is_C_true = True

    # D. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, 
    #    owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.
    # Reasoning: True. This is a plausible biological mechanism known as catabolite repression.
    is_D_true = True
    
    # E. Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, 
    #    owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.
    # Reasoning: False. The MA biotype is not adapted to metabolize raffinose.
    # Exposing it to more raffinose won't cause it to suddenly develop an efficient metabolic pathway.
    # Its galactosidase activity would remain low, not increase.
    is_E_true = False
    
    # The question asks for the statement that is NOT true.
