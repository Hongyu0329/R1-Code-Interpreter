    "In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the dominant strategy for both players is to defect, leading to a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium of (1, 1). However, when the game is played in a quantum setting using an entangled initial state, a new equilibrium can emerge that resolves this dilemma.\n\nThis resolution is achieved using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. Here is the plan to find the equilibrium point:\n1.  **Initial State**: We start with a classical state `|Cooperate, Cooperate⟩` and apply an entangling operator `J` to create a maximally entangled state shared between the two players. This entangled state links the players' fates, making their choices interdependent in a non-classical way.\n2.  **Strategies as Quantum Gates**: Players' strategies are no longer just \"Cooperate\" or \"Defect\" but are represented by quantum gates (unitary matrices) that they apply to their part of the entangled state. We will consider three key strategies:\n    *   **Cooperate (C)**: The Identity matrix `I`.\n    *   **Defect (D)**: The Pauli-Y matrix multiplied by `i` (`iσ_y`). This is a standard representation of the classical 'Defect' move in the quantum formalism.\n    *   **Quantum Strategy (Q)**: The Pauli-Z matrix multiplied by `i` (`iσ_z`). This is a \"miracle\" move, unavailable in the classical game, that allows players to escape the dilemma.\n3.  **Equilibrium**: A new Nash Equilibrium exists where both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`. At this `(Q, Q)` equilibrium, neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy to `C` or `D`, as doing so would result in a lower payoff. The dilemma is resolved because this equilibrium point corresponds to the mutually cooperative outcome.\n4.  **Calculation**: After the players apply their strategy gates, a disentangling operator `J†` (the conjugate transpose of `J`) is applied, and the final state is measured. The probabilities of the four classical outcomes (`CC`, `CD`, `DC`, `DD`) are used to calculate the expected payoff for each player based on the given payoff matrix.\n\nThe following Python code simulates the `(Q, Q)` strategy profile. It calculates the probabilities of each outcome and then computes the final equilibrium payoff, demonstrating that both players achieve the optimal cooperative outcome of 5.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- 1.
