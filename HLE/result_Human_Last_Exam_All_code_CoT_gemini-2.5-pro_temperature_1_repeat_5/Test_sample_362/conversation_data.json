    "To determine the product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction:** The Wittig reaction forms an alkene by combining an aldehyde (or ketone) with a phosphorus ylide. The aldehyde's oxygen atom is swapped with the ylide's carbon group.\n    *   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`. The key part is the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` group.\n    *   **Ylide:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane, `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`. The key part is the `=CH-CH₂-(o-chlorophenyl)` group.\n\n2.  **Determine Product Structure:** The reaction will form a new C=C double bond, creating the alkene `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`. The other product is triphenylphosphine oxide, `Ph₃P=O`.\n\n3.  **Use Python for a Programmatic Solution:** I will use the `rdkit` library, a powerful tool for cheminformatics in Python.\n    *   I will represent the reactants using their SMILES strings.\n    *   I will define the Wittig reaction using the SMARTS reaction-mapping language.\n    *   The `rdkit` library will be used to virtually \"run\" the reaction and generate the product molecule.\n    *   From the resulting product molecule, I can determine its molecular formula and IUPAC name.\n\n4.  **Fulfill Output Requirements:**\n    *   The code will print the full, balanced chemical equation using molecular formulas.\n    *   To satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the code will break down the molecular formula of each reactant and product, explaining the count of each atom (C, H, O, etc.).\n    *   Finally, the IUPAC name of the main organic product will be stated clearly.\n\nYou may need to install the `rdkit` library to run this code: `pip install rdkit`\n\n```python\n# The user might need to install rdkit: pip install rdkit\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import rdChemReactions\n    from rdkit.Chem import rdMolDescriptors\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the rdkit library.\")\n    print(\"Please install it using: pip install rdkit\")\n    exit()\n\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the product of a specific Wittig reaction,\n    and prints the balanced equation with an explanation of the molecular formulas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
