    print("The question is: Does there exist a program P that computes def_superfast(10000)?")
    print("The answer is No. The function is uncomputable. Here is the proof by contradiction:\n")

    print("--- The Setup ---")
    print("Let's analyze the definition of def_superfast(10000):")
    print("1. It considers all Python programs with source code less than 10000 symbols.")
    print("2. It finds the largest integer returned by any of these programs that halt. Let's call this value 'Huge_int'.")
    print("3. The function is supposed to return the value of the final equation: Huge_int + 1.\n")

    print("--- The Paradox ---")
    print("Step 1: Assume a program `P` that correctly computes def_superfast(10000) EXISTS.")
    print("This means we can call `P(10000)` and it will return `Huge_int + 1`.\n")

    print("Step 2: Let's create a new program, `Q`, that uses `P`.")
    print("The source code for `Q` would be simple, something like:")
    print("   'from P import def_superfast; print(def_superfast(10000))'")
    print("The length of this source code is very small, much less than 10000 symbols.\n")

    print("Step 3: Analyze our new program `Q`.")
    print("   - `Q` is a valid Python program shorter than 10000 symbols.")
    print("   - `Q` halts and prints an integer.")
    print("   - The integer it prints is `Huge_int + 1` (because it calls `P`).\n")

    print("Step 4: The Contradiction.")
    print("   - By definition, `Huge_int` is the largest integer that ANY program shorter than 10000 symbols can return.")
    print("   - But our program `Q` is shorter than 10000 symbols, and it returns `Huge_int + 1`.")
    print("   - Therefore, the largest possible output, `Huge_int`, must be at least as large as the output of `Q`.")
    print("   - This leads to the following impossible mathematical statement:")
    
    # The final equation from the logic
    huge_int_variable = "Huge_int"
    one = 1
    print(f"     {huge_int_variable} >= {huge_int_variable} + {one}")
    
    print("\nThis inequality is a logical contradiction, as no number can be greater than or equal to itself plus one.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The contradiction forces us to reject our initial assumption from Step 1.")
    print("Therefore, no program `P` can exist to compute def_superfast(10000).")
