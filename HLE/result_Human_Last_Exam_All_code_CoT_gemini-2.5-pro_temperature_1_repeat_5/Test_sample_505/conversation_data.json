    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits, we need to understand how they are encoded in a surface code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the encoding rule:** For a planar surface code (a \"patch\") with `b` boundaries or holes, the number of logical qubits it can encode is `k = b - 1`.\n2.  **Analyze the given setup:** We have two separate patches of surface code. The phrase \"with two holes\" is most reasonably interpreted as each patch having two holes.\n3.  **Calculate qubits per patch:** Apply the formula `k = b - 1` to a single patch with `b=2` holes.\n4.  **Calculate total qubits:** Since the two patches are separate systems, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n5.  **Construct the final equation:** Combine the steps into a single calculation and print it.\n\nThis approach will give us the total number of logical qubits for the entire system.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of logical qubits for a surface code with multiple patches and holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of separate surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes in each patch\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # The formula for logical qubits (k) in a planar code with b boundaries (holes) is k = b - 1.\n    # We calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch first.\n    qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch - 1\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum of qubits from each independent patch.\n    total_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n\n    print(f\"The number of logical qubits 'k' for a planar surface code with 'b' holes is given by the formula: k = b - 1.\")\n    print(f\"For a single patch with {num_holes_per_patch} holes, the number of logical qubits is {num_holes_per_patch} - 1 = {qubits_per_patch}.\")\n    print(f\"Since there are {num_patches} such patches, the total number of logical qubits is calculated as:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with all numbers shown\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {num_patches} * ({num_holes_per_patch} - 1) = {total_qubits}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, at most {total_qubits} logical qubits can be encoded.\")\n\ncalculate_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
