The core of the problem is to explain how a bacterial population (Bacterium 2) relying on rare, random mutations can acquire drug resistance as quickly as a population (Bacterium 1) using rapid lateral gene transfer.

Let's analyze the key concepts:

1.  **Resistance Mutation:** A rare, random mutation must occur first to grant resistance. This alone is not enough to explain the speed.

2.  **Fitness Cost & Compensatory Mutations:** The initial resistance mutation often makes the bacterium less 'fit' (e.g., slower growth). A second 'compensatory' mutation can occur that alleviates this cost. This allows the resistant strain to survive and reproduce effectively, helping it spread.

3.  **Cross-Resistance:** This is a phenomenon where a single mutation provides resistance to multiple, different drugs. This is a massive evolutionary advantage, as one event can solve several environmental challenges at once.

The best answer combines these concepts to create a scenario where the mutation-driven resistance is dramatically accelerated:

- A rare mutation occurs that not only provides resistance to one drug but also confers **cross-resistance** to others.
- This highly advantageous mutation might come with a fitness cost, but this is quickly fixed by **compensatory mutations**.

The result is a 'super-bug' strain that is highly fit and resistant to multiple drugs. This strain can then rapidly sweep through the population, allowing the overall population to acquire resistance at a pace that rivals the speed of lateral gene transfer. Option B describes this exact combination of events.
