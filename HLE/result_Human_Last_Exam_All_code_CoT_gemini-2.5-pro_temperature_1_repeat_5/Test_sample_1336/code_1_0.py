# Step 1: Define the simple group S and the context of the problem.
# The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings of D(PSL(2,p), b, w).
# This is interpreted as finding the number of quasi-simple covering groups for S = PSL(2,p).
# A group G is a quasi-simple covering group of S if G is perfect and G/Z(G) is isomorphic to S.

# Step 2: Use the theory of Schur multipliers.
# The number of such covering groups is equal to the number of subgroups of the Schur multiplier M(S).

# Step 3: Identify the Schur multiplier for S = PSL(2,p) where p > 5 is prime.
# It is a standard result that M(PSL(2,p)) is the cyclic group of order 2, denoted Z_2.

# The number of subgroups of a cyclic group Z_n is equal to the number of divisors of n.
