    # The problem asks for the smallest integer m.
    # Let's analyze the set A for a general natural number n.
    # A = {(x_1, ..., x_n) | for each i, x_i is a cube of a rational number}
    # This means for (x_1, ..., x_n) to be in A, there must exist
    # rational numbers r_1, ..., r_n such that:
    # x_1 = r_1^3
    # x_2 = r_2^3
    # ...
    # x_n = r_n^3

    # The definition of an m-diophantine set requires a SINGLE polynomial equation F.
    # We can combine these n equations into one using the sum of squares,
    # because for rational numbers, a sum of squares is 0 if and only if each term is 0.
    # The single equation is:
    # (x_1 - r_1^3)^2 + (x_2 - r_2^3)^2 + ... + (x_n - r_n^3)^2 = 0

    # In the definition of an m-diophantine set, the variables r_i correspond to the
    # existentially quantified variables y_j.
    # We have n such variables: r_1, r_2, ..., r_n.
    # So, we need n variables y_1, ..., y_n, which implies m = n.
    # The polynomial F would be:
    # F(X_1, ..., X_n, Y_1, ..., Y_n) = sum_{i=1 to n} (X_i - Y_i^3)^2

    # This shows that m <= n.

    # For the lower bound, we need to show m >= n.
    # The set A is determined by n independent rational parameters r_1, ..., r_n.
    # The Diophantine definition provides m parameters y_1, ..., y_m.
    # It is not possible to encode n independent parameters into m < n parameters
    # using a single polynomial equation. The n degrees of freedom in choosing
    # (r_1, ..., r_n) cannot be captured by fewer than n existential variables.
    # Therefore, we need at least n variables, so m >= n.

    # Combining m <= n and m >= n, we get m = n.
