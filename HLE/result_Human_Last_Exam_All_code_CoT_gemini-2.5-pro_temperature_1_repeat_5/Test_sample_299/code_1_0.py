    print("\nCase A: f is Strictly Decreasing")
    print("If f is strictly decreasing, f(f(x)) is strictly increasing, which is consistent with exp(x).")

    print("   - If c = 0, f(0)=0. Then f(f(0))=f(0)=0. But exp(0)=1. Contradiction.")
    print("   - If c >= 1, it leads to contradictions (e.g., if c=1, f(0)=1 and f(1)=1, which isn't strictly increasing).")
    print("   - If c < 0, then f(c) < f(0) = c < 0. But f(c)=1. Contradiction.")

    print("The number of solutions is the number of ways we can make the initial choices.")
    print("1. The number of choices for c in the interval (0, 1) is |(0, 1)| = |R| = c (the cardinality of the continuum).")
    print("2. For each c, the number of choices for the function phi (a continuous, strictly increasing bijection from [0, c] to [c, 1]) is also c.")
