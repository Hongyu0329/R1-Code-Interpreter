# The problem is to find the flux of the vector field F through the two yellow sides of a pyramid.
# The flux is given by the surface integral of F 路 dS.

# Vector Field F = (3x^3*y^2*z, 3x^2*y^3, z)

# The pyramid has its apex at (0,0,4) and base vertices at (+-1, +-1, 0).
# Let's define the first yellow face (S1) by vertices (0,0,4), (1,1,0), and (-1,1,0).
# This face lies on the plane z = 4 - 4y.
# The outward normal vector dS is (0, 4, 1) dx dy.
# The dot product F 路 dS = (3x^3*y^2*z, 3x^2*y^3, z) 路 (0, 4, 1)
