# The problem is to find the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, 2, ..., 100)
# such that n gives distinct remainders when divided by each of k = 2, 3, ..., 100.

# Let r_k be the remainder of n when divided by k.
# The condition is that the set of remainders {r_2, r_3, ..., r_100} contains 99 distinct values,
# and for each k, 0 <= r_k < k.

# We can think of this as defining a function f(k) = r_k for k in {2, 3, ..., 100}.
# This function must be injective (distinct remainders) and satisfy f(k) < k.

# Let's count the number of such functions by choosing f(k) for k = 2, 3, ... sequentially.
# - For k=2, f(2) must be < 2. So f(2) can be 0 or 1. There are 2 choices.
# - For k=3, f(3) must be < 3 and not equal to f(2).
#   The set of values taken so far is {f(2)}.
#   The set of available values for f(3) is {0, 1, 2} \ {f(2)}. This set has 2 elements. So there are 2 choices for f(3).
# - In general, for a given k, we assume f(2), ..., f(k-1) are chosen.
#   The set of values taken is I_{k-1} = {f(2), ..., f(k-1)}.
#   The condition f(i) < i for i < k implies that all values in I_{k-1} are less than k-1.
#   The number of choices for f(k) is the size of the set {0, 1, ..., k-1} \ I_{k-1}.
#   The set I_{k-1} has k-2 elements.
#   It can be shown that at each step k from 3 to 100, there are exactly 2 choices for f(k).

# The total number of such functions is the product of the number of choices for each k.
# There are 99 steps, from k=2 to k=100. At each step, there are 2 choices.
# So, the total number is 2 * 2 * ... * 2 (99 times).

base = 2
exponent = 99
result = base ** exponent

# Each such function corresponds to a unique system of congruences, which in turn gives a
# unique solution for n modulo lcm(2, ..., 100). This means there is one solution n for each function.
# The total number of integers n is therefore the total number of valid functions.
