    "My plan is to solve this by searching for the correct rule. An elementary cellular automaton's evolution is determined by a rule, an integer from 0 to 255. Since we have the state before and after the missing step, I can iterate through all 256 possible rules. For each rule, I will perform the two required steps and see if the result matches the given final state.\n\n1.  Start with the first row: `01101001`.\n2.  Pick a rule from 0 to 255.\n3.  Apply this rule to the first row to generate a candidate for the intermediate row. I will assume periodic boundary conditions (the grid wraps around).\n4.  Apply the same rule to this new intermediate row to generate a candidate for the final row.\n5.  Compare this calculated final row with the given final row: `10000111`.\n6.  If they match, I have found the correct rule and the corresponding intermediate row. Since the problem implies a unique solution, I will stop and provide that intermediate row as the answer.\n7.  The final output will display the full three-line sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton sequence.\n    It iterates through all 256 possible rules to find the one that\n    correctly transforms the initial state to the final state in two steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    row_a_str = \"01101001\"\n    row_c_target_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    row_a = [int(c) for c in row_a_str]\n    row_c_target = [int(c) for c in row_c_target_str]\n    length = len(row_a)\n    \n    solution_found = None\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible rules\n    for rule_number in range(256):\n        # Get the 8-bit binary representation of the rule (Wolfram convention)\n        rule_bin = format(rule_number, '08b')\n\n        # Define a function to apply the rule to a row\n        def get_next_row(input_row):\n            new_row = [0] * length\n            for i in range(length):\n                # Get neighborhood with periodic boundary conditions\n                left = input_row[(i - 1 + length) % length]\n                center = input_row[i]\n                right = input_row[(i + 1) % length]\n\n                # Determine which part of the rule to use based on the neighborhood\n                if   left==1 and center==1 and right==1: new_row[i] = int(rule_bin[0])\n                elif left==1 and center==1 and right==0: new_row[i] = int(rule_bin[1])\n                elif left==1 and center==0 and right==1: new_row[i] = int(rule_bin[2])\n                elif left==1 and center==0 and right==0: new_row[i] = int(rule_bin[3])\n                elif left==0 and center==1 and right==1: new_row[i] = int(rule_bin[4])\n                elif left==0 and center==1 and right==0: new_row[i] = int(rule_bin[5])\n                elif left==0 and center==0 and right==1: new_row[i] = int(rule_bin[6])\n                elif left==0 and center==0 and right==0: new_row[i] = int(rule_bin[7])\n            return new_row\n\n        # Step 1: Generate the intermediate row (row_b)\n        row_b_candidate = get_next_row(row_a)\n        \n        # Step 2: Generate the final row (row_c) from the intermediate row\n        row_c_generated = get_next_row(row_b_candidate)\n        \n        # Step 3: Check if the generated final row matches the target\n        if row_c_generated == row_c_target:\n            solution_found = \"\".join(map(str, row_b_candidate))\n            break\n            \n    # Print the full sequence\n    if solution_found:\n        print(row_a_str)\n        print(solution_found)\n        print(row_c_target_str)\n    else:\n        print(\"No valid solution found for the given sequence.\")\n\nsolve_cellular_automaton()\n<<<01011010>>>\n```"
