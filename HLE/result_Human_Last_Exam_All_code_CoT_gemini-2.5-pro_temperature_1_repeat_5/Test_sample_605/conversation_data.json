    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Weights and the Polynomial:**\n    The ambient space is defined by the weights `w = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n    The polynomial is `$f = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree of the Polynomial (d):**\n    For the link to be well-defined, the polynomial must be quasi-homogeneous, meaning every term must have the same weighted degree, `d`. The weighted degree of a term like `$z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}...z_n^{a_n}$` is calculated as `$a_1w_1 + a_2w_2 + ... + a_nw_n$`.\n    Let's calculate the degree for each term:\n    *   `deg(z_1^8z_3) = 8*22 + 1*49 = 176 + 49 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4*22 + 3*29 + 1*49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224`\n    *   `deg(z_1z_2^7) = 1*22 + 7*29 = 22 + 203 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = 1*22 + 1*29 + 1*49 + 1*50 + 1*75 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_2z_3^4) = 1*29 + 4*49 = 29 + 196 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_4^3z_5) = 3*50 + 1*75 = 150 + 75 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_5^3) = 3*75 = 225`\n    We notice that one term has a degree of 224, while all others have a degree of 225. This points to a likely typo in the polynomial. Since the object is described as a \"Calabi-Yau Link,\" we proceed by assuming the intended degree is the one that appears most frequently, which is `d = 225`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Sum of the Weights (Σwᵢ):**\n    `Σwᵢ = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Crawley-Nordström Invariant Formula:**\n    The invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface is given by the formula: `inv(f) = (d - Σwᵢ) / d`.\n    A key property of a Calabi-Yau manifold defined this way is that its degree equals the sum of the weights (`d = Σwᵢ`). In our case, `d = 225` and `Σwᵢ = 225`, so the condition is satisfied.\n    Plugging the values into the formula: `inv(f) = (225 - 225) / 225 = 0 / 225 = 0`.\n\nThe following Python code automates these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define weights and polynomial terms\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    # Exponents for each term z_1^a1 * z_2^a2 * ...\n    # f = z_1^8*z_3 + z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3 + z_1*z_2^7 + z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5 + z_2*z_3^4 + z_4^3*z_5 + z_5^3\n    terms_exponents = [\n        [8, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n        [4, 3, 1, 0, 0],\n        [1, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 4, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 3, 1],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 3]\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the degree d of the polynomial\n    term_degrees = [sum(e * w for e, w in zip(term, weights)) for term in terms_exponents]\n\n    if len(set(term_degrees)) > 1:\n        print(f\"Warning: The polynomial is not quasi-homogeneous.
