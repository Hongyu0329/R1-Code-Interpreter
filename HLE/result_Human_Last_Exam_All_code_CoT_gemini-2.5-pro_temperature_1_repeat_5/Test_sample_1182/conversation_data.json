    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve and its genus.** The given curve is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $d=5$. The genus $g$ of a hyperelliptic curve is given by $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor$. For our curve, this is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\n2.  **Find a better model.** The process of finding the stable reduction involves finding a suitable model of the curve through a change of variables. The goal is to simplify the equation's reduction modulo 2. We can apply a sequence of transformations of the form $(x, y) \\to (x/2, y/2)$. Let the initial polynomial be $f_0(x)$. We define a sequence of polynomials $f_{i+1}(x) = \\frac{1}{4} f_i(2x)$.\n\n    *   $f_0(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. Reduction mod 2 of $y^2=f_0(x)$ is $y^2=x^2$, which is singular.\n    *   $f_1(x) = \\frac{1}{4}f_0(2x) = 64x^5 + 16x^4 + 8x^3 + x^2 + 4x$. Reduction is again $y^2=x^2$.\n    *   $f_2(x) = \\frac{1}{4}f_1(2x) = 512x^5 + 64x^4 + 16x^3 + x^2 + 2x$. Reduction is still $y^2=x^2$.\n    *   $f_3(x) = \\frac{1}{4}f_2(2x) = 4096x^5 + 256x^4 + 32x^3 + x^2 + x$. The reduction of $y^2=f_3(x)$ modulo 2 is $y^2 = x^2+x$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final model's reduction.** The curve $y^2 = x^2+x$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is smooth. We can check this by finding its partial derivatives: the derivative with respect to $y$ is $2y \\equiv 0$, and the derivative with respect to $x$ is $2x+1 \\equiv 1$. Since the derivative with respect to $x$ is never zero, the curve has no singular points.\n\n4.  **Calculate the genus of the reduced curve.** The reduced curve $\\bar{C}: y^2+x^2+x=0$ can be rewritten as $(y+x)^2=x$. This is a parabola, which is a rational curve. The genus of a smooth rational curve, which we denote $g_s$, is 0.\n\n5.  **Apply the genus drop formula.** The reduction is \"bad\" because the genus of the generic fiber ($g=2$) is different from the genus of the special fiber ($g_s=0$). For curves with this type of reduction, the number of double points, $\\delta$, in the stable reduction is given by the difference in genera (the \"genus drop\"):\n    $\\delta = g - g_s$\n    Plugging in our values, we get:\n    $\\delta = 2 - 0 = 2$\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has 2 double points.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve\n    y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 above 2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Genus of the generic curve y^2 = f(x)\n    # The degree of f(x) is 5.\n    d = 5\n    # The genus of the generic curve is g = floor((d-1)/2).\n    g = (d - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Step 2 & 3: Find a model with a smooth reduction and calculate its genus.\n    # The process of finding a stable reduction involves a sequence of transformations.\n    # As described in the explanation, after 3 transformations, we arrive at a model\n    # whose reduction modulo 2 is y^2 = x^2 + x.\n    # This reduced curve is smooth and rational (isomorphic to a parabola).\n    # The genus of a smooth rational curve is 0.\n    g_s = 0\n\n    # Step 4: The number of double points (delta) in the stable reduction is\n    # given by the genus drop formula: delta = g - g_s.\n    delta = g - g_s\n\n    # The final equation is delta = g - g_s\n    print(f\"The genus of the original curve is g = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the stable reduction's component is g_s = {g_s}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of double points is delta = g - g_s = {g} - {g_s} = {delta}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
