$\zeta_n = \left(\frac{\tilde{N_1} \tilde{N_2}}{n}\right)$, where $\tilde{N_1}$ and $\tilde{N_2}$ are the odd parts of $N_1$ and $N_2$ respectively. This formula holds for odd integers $n$ under conditions where the defining sum is non-zero (e.g., $N_1, N_2$ are even) and simplifies cleanly (e.g., $\gcd(n, N_1N_2)=1$).
