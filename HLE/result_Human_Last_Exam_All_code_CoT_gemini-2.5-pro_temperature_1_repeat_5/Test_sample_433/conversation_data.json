    "Based on the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> guidelines for sterile compounding, I will provide the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the key factors from the user's request: \"single dose container ampule,\" \"time of puncture,\" and \"sterile environment.\"\n2.  A \"sterile environment\" in this context refers to an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air quality environment, such as a laminar airflow workbench.\n3.  Consult USP <797> standards for single-dose vials/ampules opened in an ISO Class 5 environment. The standard states that such containers can be used for up to 12 hours after the initial opening.\n4.  Create a Python script that states these conditions and presents the calculation for the BUD clearly, showing the final number of hours.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bud_single_dose_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    opened in a sterile environment, based on USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters based on the query\n    container_type = \"Single-Dose Ampule\"\n    environment = \"Sterile Environment (ISO Class 5 or better)\"\n    \n    # Per USP <797>, the allowable time for a single-dose container opened\n    # in an ISO Class 5 environment is 12 hours.\n    allowable_use_time_hours = 12\n    \n    # Represent the starting time symbolically\n    puncture_time_symbol = \"T_0 (Time of Puncture)\"\n    \n    # Print the \"equation\" and the result\n    print(\"Calculating the Beyond-Use Date (BUD):\")\n    print(f\"Container Type: {container_type}\")\n    print(f\"Environment: {environment}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n    print(\"BUD Equation:\")\n    print(f\"BUD = {puncture_time_symbol} + {allowable_use_time_hours} hours\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n    print(f\"The final answer is that the Beyond-Use Date is up to {allowable_use_time_hours} hours after the time of puncture.\")\n\ncalculate_bud_single_dose_ampule()\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
