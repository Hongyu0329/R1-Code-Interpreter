# The problem simplifies to calculating 2^81, as derived from the reasoning above.
# The given large prime p and the complex formula are structured in a way
# that the result is independent of p's specific value, provided it satisfies the conditions.

# Calculate the value of 2 to the power of 81.
result = 2**81

# The final equation is f(p) = 2^81.
# We print the components of this equation and the final result.
base = 2
exponent = 81
print(f"{base} ^ {exponent} = {result}")
