    "To solve this problem, we need to determine two values: the total number of squares on the edge of a chessboard and the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on those squares.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares:** An 8x8 board has 64 squares in total. The inner part of the board, which is not on the edge, is a 6x6 grid. The number of edge squares is the total number of squares minus the inner squares (64 - 36 = 28).\n2.  **Find the maximum number of bishops:** To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can consider the light and dark squares separately, as a bishop on one color can never attack a bishop on the other. For an 8x8 board, you can place a maximum of 7 bishops on the 14 dark edge squares and 7 bishops on the 14 light edge squares. This gives a total of 14 bishops.\n3.  **Calculate the difference:** The number of edge squares that lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the maximum number of bishops we can place.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_on_edge_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on an 8x8 chessboard\n    after placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An n x n board has 4*(n-1) squares on its edge.\n    total_edge_squares = 4 * (board_size - 1)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops\n    # that can be placed on the edge of an n x n board.\n    # This is 2 for each color for the corners and n-2 for each side,\n    # leading to the formula 2*n - 2.\n    # For an 8x8 board, this is 2 * 8 - 2 = 14.\n    max_bishops_on_edge = 2 * board_size - 2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of edge squares without bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_on_edge\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with the calculated numbers.\n    print(f\"A standard {board_size}x{board_size} chessboard has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on these squares is {max_bishops_on_edge}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the number of edge squares that would lack bishops is:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops_on_edge} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_on_edge_problem()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
