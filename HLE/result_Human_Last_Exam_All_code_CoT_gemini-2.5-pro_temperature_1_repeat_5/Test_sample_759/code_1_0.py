    This function determines the smallest number of edges 'e' for a simple,
    connected graph with an automorphism group of size 3.
    """
    # The smallest number of edges 'e' is found by constructing the minimal graph
    # that satisfies the condition |Aut(γ)| = 3.
    #
    # The reasoning is as follows:
    # 1. The automorphism group must be Z_3.
    # 2. This implies the graph has a 3-fold rotational symmetry but no reflectional symmetry.
    # 3. Edges in such a graph are grouped into orbits of size 3. This suggests 'e' is a multiple of 3.
    # 4. Smaller candidates like e=3 or e=6 can be ruled out as they lead to graphs with
    #    more symmetries (e.g., C_3 or K_1,3 have |Aut|=6).
    # 5. The smallest known graph satisfying the condition has 9 vertices and 9 edges.
    #    It can be constructed from a 3-cycle (triangle) with a path of length 2
    #    attached to each vertex.
    #
    # The construction of the graph with e=9:
    # - Vertices V = {0, 1, ..., 8}.
    # - Edges E = {(0,3), (3,6), (6,0)}  -- A central triangle
    #           + {(0,1), (3,4), (6,7)}  -- Attaching the first vertex of each path
    #           + {(1,2), (4,5), (7,8)}  -- Completing the paths of length 2
    # This graph has 9 vertices and 9 edges, is connected, and |Aut(γ)|=3.

    smallest_e = 9

    # The problem asks for the smallest number 'e'. There is no equation,
    # so we print the final number directly.
