    "Here is my analysis of your question based on Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint, followed by a Python script to model the logic.\n\n### Philosophical Analysis\n\nGareth Evans's Generality Constraint (GC) posits that thoughts are structured and systematic. In its classic formulation, it states that if a thinker can understand the propositions *'a is F'* and *'b is G'*, they must also possess the conceptual capacity to understand *'a is G'* and *'b is F'*. The core idea is that concepts (like those for objects *a*, *b* and properties *F*, *G*) are recombinable components of thought.\n\nNow, let's address your question: If you understand *Fa* (e.g., \"4 is an even number\"), does the GC imply you should be able to understand *∀x Fx* (e.g., \"All numbers in this set are even numbers\"), assuming you also understand the concept of universal quantification (*∀*, \"for all\")?\n\n1.  **Strict Interpretation:** On a strict reading, the GC is about swapping subject concepts with other subject concepts and predicate concepts with other predicate concepts. The move from *Fa* to *∀x Fx* is different; it involves replacing a specific subject (*a*) with a logical operator (the universal quantifier *∀x*). Therefore, under a narrow interpretation, the GC does not *directly* compel this conclusion.\n\n2.  **Broad Interpretation (The Spirit of the Constraint):** However, the philosophical principle underlying the GC is that thought is compositional. You build complex thoughts from simpler conceptual parts. In your scenario:\n    *   From understanding *Fa*, you possess the concept of the predicate **F**.\n    *   By your own assumption, you possess the concept of the universal quantifier **∀x**.\n\n    The spirit of the Generality Constraint—that conceptual abilities are productive and systematic—strongly suggests that you should be able to combine these two concepts you possess (*F* and *∀x*) to form the new, complex thought *∀x Fx*. Your thinking wouldn't be very systematic if you had the parts but were unable to assemble them in a logically valid way.\n\nTherefore, while not a textbook application of the GC, the conclusion follows from its underlying principles. Given you understand the predicate *F* and the logical machinery of quantification, you should have the capacity to formulate the universally quantified thought.\n\n### Plan for the Code\n\nI will write a Python script to demonstrate this logical step.\n1.  Define a \"domain of discourse\"—a set of numbers `X`.\n2.  Define a specific individual `a` from that domain.\n3.  Define a predicate `F` as a Python function (e.g., `is_positive`).\n4.  First, model understanding `Fa` by applying the function to the individual `a` and printing the result.\n5.  Then, model understanding `∀x Fx` by applying the function to *all* elements in the domain and checking if it's true for all of them, as stipulated by the universal quantifier.\n6.  Finally, I will print the full logical \"equation\" for the universal check, showing each number being tested, to satisfy the output requirement.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script models the logical relationship between understanding a singular\n    proposition (Fa) and a universal one (∀x Fx).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
