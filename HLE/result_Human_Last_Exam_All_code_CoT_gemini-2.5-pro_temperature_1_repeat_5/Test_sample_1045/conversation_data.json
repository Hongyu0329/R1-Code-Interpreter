    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** The molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8. This means it contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used for each atom.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The `31G` part applies. The single 1s valence orbital is represented by two contracted basis functions (a split-valence representation). One function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian. Thus, each H atom has **2** contracted functions.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is represented by **1** contracted function (from 6 primitives).\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are split. They are described by two sets of functions:\n            *   An inner set (from 3 primitives): 1 s-function + 3 p-functions = **4** contracted functions.\n            *   An outer set (from 1 primitive): 1 s-function + 3 p-functions = **4** contracted functions.\n        *   Therefore, each C atom has a total of 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** We multiply the number of each type of atom by the number of functions it contributes and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from carbon atoms\ntotal_from_carbon = num_carbon * functions_per_carbon\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from hydrogen atoms\ntotal_from_hydrogen = num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the grand total\ntotal_functions = total_from_carbon + total_from_hydrogen\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(f\"For toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"\\nTotal contracted functions calculation:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon} * {functions_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen} * {functions_per_hydrogen}) = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
