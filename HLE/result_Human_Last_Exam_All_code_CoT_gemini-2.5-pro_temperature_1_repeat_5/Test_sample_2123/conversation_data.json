    "This is a classic literary puzzle based on a pun made by the Russian-American poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky. The solution requires connecting Vienna, a specific Russian word, and the Russian transliteration of an English poet's name.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that explains this connection step-by-step:\n1.  Identify the key phrase from the puzzle: The \"ring\" of boulevards in Vienna (the Ringstrasse).\n2.  State the Russian word for \"ring\", which is \"кольцо\" (kol'tso).\n3.  Identify the English poet whose name, when written in Russian, creates a pun with the word \"ring\".\n4.  Show the Russian spelling of the poet's name, \"Кольридж\" (Kol'ridzh), and demonstrate how its first syllable matches the root of the Russian word for \"ring\".\n5.  Conclude with the poet's surname in English.\n\n```python\ndef solve_literary_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the puzzle by explaining the literary pun\n    at its core.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. The puzzle refers to the Vienna Ringstrasse, a ring of boulevards.\n    # The key word is \"ring\".\n    \n    # 2. In Joseph Brodsky's original Russian essay, he makes a pun.\n    # The Russian word for \"ring\" is 'кольцо'.\n    russian_word_for_ring = \"кольцо\"\n    pronunciation_ring = \"kol'tso\"\n\n    # 3. The surname of the English poet, when transliterated into Russian,\n    # starts with the same root as the word for \"ring\".\n    poet_surname_in_russian = \"Кольридж\"\n    pronunciation_poet = \"Kol'ridzh\"\n    \n    # 4. The \"equation\" is the shared root between the two words.\n    shared_root = \"Коль-\"\n\n    print(\"The puzzle is based on a pun in a Russian essay by Joseph Brodsky.\")\n    print(\"He connects the 'ring' of boulevards in Vienna to a poet's name.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Here is the logical 'equation':\")\n    print(f\"1. The Russian word for 'ring' is: {russian_word_for_ring} (pronounced '{pronunciation_ring}')\")\n    print(f\"2. The Russian spelling of the poet's name is: {poet_surname_in_russian} (pronounced '{pronunciation_poet}')\")\n    print(f\"3. The connection is the shared root: '{shared_root}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 5. This reveals the English surname.\n    english_surname = \"Coleridge\"\n    print(f\"Therefore, the English poet's surname is: {english_surname}\")\n\nsolve_literary_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Coleridge>>>"
