# Step 1: Calculate the number of edges on the outer perimeter.
# The initial square has 4 corners. The "Corner" cut clips these corners,
# turning the 4-vertex square into an 8-vertex octagon.
outer_edges_after_corner_clip = 4 * 2

# The two "Edge" cuts create 4 notches on the horizontal sides and 4 on the vertical sides.
num_notches = 4 + 4

# Each notch adds 2 vertices to the perimeter. For a simple polygon, the number of edges equals the number of vertices.
# The initial 8 vertices from the octagon plus the new vertices from the notches.
total_outer_vertices = outer_edges_after_corner_clip + (num_notches * 2)
outer_perimeter_edges = total_outer_vertices

# Step 2: Calculate the number of edges of the internal holes.
# The "Center" cut point is on 4 fold lines, so the hole has 2^4 sides.
center_hole_edges = 2**4

# The "Horizontal Edge" cut creates one octagonal (8-sided) hole.
h_edge_hole_edges = 8

# The "Vertical Edge" cut also creates one octagonal (8-sided) hole.
v_edge_hole_edges = 8

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of edges.
total_edges = outer_perimeter_edges + center_hole_edges + h_edge_hole_edges + v_edge_hole_edges

# Step 4: Print the final breakdown and the result.
