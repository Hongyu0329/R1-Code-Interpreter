# The problem asks for the constant 'b' in the asymptotic formula C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2).
# Through analysis, we found that b = sqrt(8 * pi).

# Define the numbers in the final equation for b.
eight = 8
pi_val = math.pi

# Calculate the value of b.
b = math.sqrt(eight * pi_val)

# Output the equation and its numerical result.
# The final code outputs each number in the final equation as requested.
print(f"The constant b is given by the equation: b = sqrt({eight} * pi)")
