    "Answering this question involves a simple but elegant argument from graph theory. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the maximum possible number of *different* clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph having exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   A clique is a set of vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set.\n    *   In a graph with `n` vertices, the size of any clique cannot be larger than `n`.\n    *   Clique sizes are positive integers. Therefore, any possible clique size `k` must satisfy `1 <= k <= n`.\n    *   This means the set of all possible clique sizes is a subset of `{1, 2, ..., n}`.\n    *   Consequently, the number of *different* clique sizes cannot exceed `n`. For `n = 128`, the maximum possible number is at most 128.\n\n3.  **Show the Upper Bound is Achievable:**\n    *   To prove that 128 is the maximum, we need to demonstrate that there exists at least one graph on 128 vertices that actually contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n    *   Consider the **complete graph** on `n` vertices, denoted `K_n`. In `K_n`, every vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. For this problem, we will use `K_128`.\n\n4.  **Verify the Construction:**\n    *   Let's check if `K_128` fulfills the requirement. We need to see if it has induced cliques of every size `k` from 1 to 128.\n    *   Pick any integer `k` where `1 <= k <= 128`.\n    *   Select any subset of `k` vertices from `K_128`.\n    *   By the definition of an induced subgraph, we take these `k` vertices and all the edges from the original graph that connect pairs of these vertices.\n    *   Since the original graph is `K_128`, every pair of vertices in our chosen subset is connected by an edge.\n    *   Therefore, the induced subgraph is itself a complete graph on `k` vertices (`K_k`), which is a clique of size `k`.\n    *   This logic applies to any `k` from 1 to 128. So, the graph `K_128` has induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., 128.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that the number of different clique sizes is at most 128, and we have constructed a graph (`K_128`) that achieves exactly 128 different sizes.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nThe Python code below formalizes this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph with n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph, as specified by the problem.\n    n = 128\n\n    # Plan:\n    # 1.
