    # 1. Establish the theoretical upper bound for the number of different clique sizes.
    # 2. Show this bound is achievable with a constructive example (the complete graph K_n).
    # 3. Conclude the maximum number is n.

    # Step 1: The upper bound.
    # A clique in a graph with n vertices cannot have more than n vertices.
    # Since clique sizes are positive integers, the possible sizes are 1, 2, ..., n.
    # Thus, there can be at most n different clique sizes.
    upper_bound = n

    # Step 2: The construction.
    # Consider the complete graph on n vertices, K_n. In this graph, every vertex
    # is connected to every other vertex.
    # Let's pick any integer k where 1 <= k <= n.
    # If we select any k vertices from K_n, the subgraph induced by them is also
    # a complete graph, K_k, because all edges between these vertices exist in K_n.
    # A K_k is a clique of size k.
    # This means the single graph K_n contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to n.

    # Step 3: The conclusion.
    # Since the number of different clique sizes is at most n, and we have found
    # a graph (K_n) that achieves n different sizes, the maximum is n.
    max_sizes = n

    # The final "equation" is that the maximum number of sizes is equal to n.
    # We print the numbers involved in this conclusion as requested.
