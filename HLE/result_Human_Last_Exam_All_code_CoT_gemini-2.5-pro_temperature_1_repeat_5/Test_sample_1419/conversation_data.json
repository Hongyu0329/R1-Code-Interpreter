    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the derivation and the corresponding Python code to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in `ϕ^4` theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** The problem concerns the `ϕ^4` quantum field theory near four spacetime dimensions. We use the concept of the Renormalization Group (RG) and dimensional regularization, where the dimension is set to `d = 4 - ϵ`, with `ϵ` being a small parameter.\n2.  **Use the Beta Function:** The RG flow of the coupling constant `u` is described by the beta function, `β(u)`. A fixed point `u*` is a value of the coupling where the flow stops, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **State the one-loop β-function:** For a `ϕ^4` theory with a single scalar field (N=1), the one-loop beta function is `β(u) = -ϵu + 3u²`, where `u` is the dimensionless coupling constant (with a specific normalization common in statistical physics literature).\n4.  **Solve for the fixed point:** We will solve the equation `β(u*) = 0` to find the possible fixed points. The non-zero solution corresponds to the interacting Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will use the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculation, making the steps clear and reproducible. The script will define the beta function, solve for its zeros, and print the non-trivial result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher \n    fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols for the coupling 'u' and the small parameter 'epsilon'\n    u, epsilon = sympy.symbols('u epsilon')\n\n    print(\"This script finds the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u*.\")\n    print(\"The theory is the phi^4 theory for a single scalar field near 4 dimensions (d = 4 - epsilon).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the one-loop beta function\n    # The beta function describes how the coupling 'u' changes with the energy scale.\n    # In a common normalization scheme, the one-loop beta function is:\n    # β(u) = -εu + 3u²\n    beta_function = -epsilon * u + 3 * u**2\n    \n    print(\"1.
