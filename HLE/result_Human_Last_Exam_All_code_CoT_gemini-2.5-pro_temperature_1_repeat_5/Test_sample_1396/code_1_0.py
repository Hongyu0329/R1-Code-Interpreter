    The query complexity for this problem is not a fixed number but O(log(1/epsilon)).
    The question for a specific number 'O' likely refers to a fundamental constant
    in the state-of-the-art algorithm by Arzi, Bei, and Suksompong (2022).

    Their algorithm's correctness proof for 4 agents relies on identifying and
    providing subroutines for all possible 'irreducible envy configurations'.
    The number of these configurations is a finite constant and serves as an
    upper bound on the types of complex problems the algorithm must solve.
