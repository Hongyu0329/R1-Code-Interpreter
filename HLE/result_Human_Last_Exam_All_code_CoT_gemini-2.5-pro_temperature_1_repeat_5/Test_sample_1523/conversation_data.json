    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function `Z` for a system is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations. For a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, this is written as:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ])`\n\nHere, `S[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action of the field. For a free (non-interacting) neutral scalar field with mass `m`, the Euclidean action in a 4-dimensional spacetime at a finite temperature `T` (where the imaginary time coordinate `τ` is compactified on a circle of length `β = 1/T`) is:\n\n`S[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ (∂_μ ϕ)² + m² ϕ² ]`\n\nThis action is quadratic in the field `ϕ`. Gaussian integrals of this form are often expressed using an inner product notation, `S[ϕ] = (1/2) (ϕ, Dϕ)`, where `D` is a linear differential operator.\n\nThe question asks for the value of the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`. Based on the standard convention, `D_ϕ` is simply the operator `D` acting on the field `ϕ`. Therefore, comparing the two forms of the action, we can identify the inner product as twice the action:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = 2 * S[ϕ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ (∂_μ ϕ)² + m² ϕ² ]`\n\nIn Euclidean spacetime, the squared four-gradient `(∂_μ ϕ)²` is the sum of the squares of the derivatives with respect to each coordinate: `(∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)²`, where `∇` is the spatial gradient.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final, complete expression for this inner product.\n\n```python\ndef print_inner_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the mathematical formula for the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ)\n    in finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The formula is constructed using unicode characters for mathematical symbols.\n    # The inner product is an integral over the Euclidean spacetime volume.\n    # At finite temperature T, the time integral is over the interval [0, β], where β = 1/T.\n    # The spatial integral is over all of 3D space.\n    # The integrand consists of the kinetic term (temporal and spatial derivatives squared)\n    # and the mass term.\n    # Note that the numbers 0, 3, and 2 are all present in the final equation.\n    equation = \"(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ (∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ² ]\"\n    print(equation)\n\nprint_inner_product_formula()\n```\n<<<∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ (∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ² ]>>>"
