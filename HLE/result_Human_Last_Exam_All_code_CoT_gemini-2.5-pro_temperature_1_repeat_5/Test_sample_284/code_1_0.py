# The problem concerns a curve in an n-dimensional space.
# In this case, the space is R^3, so we set n = 3.
n = 3

# A key theorem in Fourier restriction theory states that for the moment curve,
# a function whose Fourier transform is the Lebesgue measure on the curve
# is in L^p(R^n) if and only if p > n * (n + 1).
# This value of p defines the critical exponent.
# Let's calculate this critical value.
p_critical = n * (n + 1)

# The question asks for the largest possible value of p for which NO L^p function
# can have its Fourier support on the moment curve.
# This holds true for p up to and including the critical value.
# For any p greater than the critical value, a counterexample exists.
# Therefore, the largest possible value of p is p_critical.
