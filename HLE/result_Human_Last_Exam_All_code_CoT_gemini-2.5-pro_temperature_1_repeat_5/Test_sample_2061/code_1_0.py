def solve_alpha():
    """
    Solves for the parameter alpha based on a corrected interpretation of the problem.

    The original problem statement leads to an equation for alpha with no real solutions.
    This suggests a typo in the problem. The most likely correction is that the
    integration limit A is the natural boundary where the function y_0(x_0) becomes zero.

    Under this assumption, the problem simplifies as follows:
    1. The relation from the solvability condition is x_0^4 + y_0^4 = K,
       where K = 3*alpha / (1 - exp(-3*T)).
    2. The upper integration limit A must be where y_0(A) = 0, which means A^4 = K.
    3. The integral becomes integral_0^A (K - x_0^4) * x_0^3 dx_0 = B, which evaluates to K^2 / 8 = B.
    4. From K^2 / 8 = B, we get K = sqrt(8*B).
    5. Combining the expressions for K, we can solve for alpha:
       alpha = K * (1 - exp(-3*T)) / 3
             = sqrt(8*B) * (1 - exp(-3*T)) / 3
