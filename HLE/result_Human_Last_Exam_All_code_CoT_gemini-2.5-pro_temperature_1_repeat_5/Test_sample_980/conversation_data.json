    "This is a tricky puzzle! It seems the phrase \"What is the next number in the sequence\" might be a distraction. A key clue is hidden in the instructions you provided: \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\".\n\nThis suggests that the sequence of numbers isn't a sequence where we need to find the next term based on a mathematical pattern, but rather that the numbers themselves form an equation. The simplest equation would be to sum them all up. The \"next number\" would then be the result of this sum.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Treat the provided list of numbers as terms in a large addition problem.\n2.  Calculate the sum of all these numbers.\n3.  Following the instructions, I will print the full equation, including all the numbers, the plus signs, and the final result.\n4.  The final answer will be the result of this sum.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of a given sequence of numbers and prints the\n    full equation as requested by the prompt. The \"next number\" in the\n    sequence is interpreted as the result of this equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The sequence of numbers from the problem\n    numbers = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n    \n    # Calculate the sum, which we'll consider the \"next number\"\n    result = sum(numbers)\n    \n    # Create a string representation of the equation\n    # e.g., \"111 + 142 + ... = result\"\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(map(str, numbers))\n    \n    # Print the full equation including the result\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_equation()\n<<<2526>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
