# Let n be the number of roots in each of the "sloped line" intervals.
# From the analysis of the graphs, we can establish an equation for the total number of roots.
# The graph of g(x) = -1/2 intersects the graph of f(x) 2 times in (0, 9].
# The graph of g(x) as a sloped line intersects f(x) on 3 separate intervals: (0, 1], (4, 5], and (8, 9].
# The number of roots 'n' is the same in each of these 3 intervals due to periodicity.
# The total number of roots is given as 8.
# Therefore, the governing equation is:
total_roots = 8
