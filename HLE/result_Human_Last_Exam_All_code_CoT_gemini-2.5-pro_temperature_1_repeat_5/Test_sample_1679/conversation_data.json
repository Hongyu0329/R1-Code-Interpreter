    "To find the first Academy Award Best Picture winner that features a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Luxor Obelisks**: There are two. One is at the Luxor Temple in Egypt, and the other stands in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **Scan Best Picture Winners**: I will review the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, starting from the first award in 1928.\n3.  **Analyze Film Settings**: For each film, I will consider its setting and plot to determine if it's likely to depict either Paris or Luxor.\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Match**: The first film on the list that is set in Paris or Luxor and features the landmark will be the answer. *An American in Paris* (1951) is a musical set in Paris and is well-known for its extensive sequences celebrating the city's famous locations. It won Best Picture at the 24th Academy Awards. This film features the Place de la Concorde, and therefore its Luxor Obelisk. I will confirm no earlier winner fits the criteria.\n5.  **Construct the Code**: I will create a Python script that programmatically presents this finding.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the first Best Picture Oscar winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # There are two Luxor Obelisks.\n    obelisk_location_1 = \"Luxor Temple, Luxor, Egypt\"\n    obelisk_location_2 = \"Place de la Concorde, Paris, France\"\n\n    # After reviewing the list of Best Picture winners, the first one\n    # to be set in a location with a Luxor Obelisk is \"An American in Paris\".\n    movie_title = \"An American in Paris\"\n    release_year = 1951\n    award_ceremony_number = 24\n    award_year = 1952 # The ceremony for 1951 films was in 1952.\n\n    # The film features the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde during its famous ballet sequence.\n    depicted_obelisk_location = obelisk_location_2\n\n    print(\"Finding the first Best Picture winner to show a Luxor Obelisk:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The two Luxor Obelisks are located in:\\n1. {obelisk_location_1}\\n2. {obelisk_location_2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to depict one of these is:\")\n    print(f\"Movie Title: {movie_title}\")\n    print(f\"Release Year: {release_year}\")\n    print(f\"It won the {award_ceremony_number}rd Academy Award for Best Picture.\")\n    print(f\"The obelisk shown is the one in the {depicted_obelisk_location}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nfind_movie_with_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
