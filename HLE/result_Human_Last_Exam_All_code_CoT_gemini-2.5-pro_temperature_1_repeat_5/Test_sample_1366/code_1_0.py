# p is the parameter from the problem statement.
p = 2
# n_min is the index for the first non-vacuum module in the decomposition,
# which gives the minimal non-zero conformal weight.
n_min = 1

# Calculate the numerator and denominator for the conformal weight formula h_n = p*n*(n+2)/4.
numerator = p * n_min * (n_min + 2)
denominator = 4

# Calculate the minimal conformal weight.
minimal_conformal_weight = numerator / denominator

print(f"(c) The minimal conformal weight for p={p} is found at n={n_min}. The calculation is: h_min = ({p} * {n_min} * ({n_min} + 2)) / {denominator} = {minimal_conformal_weight}")
