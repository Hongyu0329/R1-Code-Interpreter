    # --- Premise ---
    print("Premise: We are considering an 'existentially forgeable digital signature scheme', with ECDSA given as an example.")
    print("Interpretation: This likely refers to ECDSA's 'signature malleability'. Given a signature sig=(r,s), a new valid signature sig'=(r, -s mod n) can be created for the same message. This is a form of existential forgery.\n")

    # --- Option A ---
    print("Analysis of A: 'For ECDSA: ... an adversary can create a new... sig' ... with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Result: FALSE. Due to signature malleability, a new signature 'sig'' for the same message can be created with probability ~1, which is non-negligible.\n")

    # --- Option B ---
    print("Analysis of B: 'For ECDSA: ... an adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Result: TRUE. This is the core security assumption of ECDSA, based on the hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Malleability does not compromise key recovery.\n")

    # --- Option C ---
    print("Analysis of C: 'For some existentially forgeable... schemes: Only given m, pk, an adversary can generate sig' ... with non-negligible probability.'")
    print("Result: TRUE. This describes universal forgery. The class of 'existentially forgeable' schemes includes insecure schemes where this is possible (e.g., a naive scheme where sig=Hash(m)).\n")

    # --- Option D ---
    print("Analysis of D: 'For all existentially forgeable... schemes: ... an adversary can figure out m ... with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Result: FALSE. This claim must hold for 'all' schemes in the class. However, some schemes are designed 'with message recovery', so this is not a universal property.\n")

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("-" * 70)
    print("Conclusion: Both statements B and C are true.")
    print("Therefore, the correct choice is E, as more than one option is true.")
