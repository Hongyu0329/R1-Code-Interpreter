No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral. Using the radial direction as the principal axis for helicity calculations is a common simplification. The rigorous method, which confirms your physical intuition, is to calculate helicity in the plane perpendicular to the actual local mean magnetic field, which requires a transformation to a Field-Aligned Coordinate system.
