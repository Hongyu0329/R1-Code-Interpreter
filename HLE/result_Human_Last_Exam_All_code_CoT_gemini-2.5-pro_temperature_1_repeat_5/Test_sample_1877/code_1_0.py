# This script calculates the value for the problem based on the model of chaotic divergence.

# --- Problem Parameters ---
# n: The period of the orbit to distinguish from (n=3)
# p: The precision in significant digits (p=7 for Era B)
n = 3
p = 7

# --- Theoretical Model ---
# The number of iterations T needed to distinguish a chaotic orbit from a
# periodic one is determined by the time it takes for an initial uncertainty
# to grow to a macroscopic scale.
# The initial uncertainty due to finite precision 'p' is epsilon = 10**(-p).
# The uncertainty grows as exp(lambda * T), where lambda is the Lyapunov exponent.
# We solve for T in: 1 ~ epsilon * exp(lambda * T)
# This gives: T = p * ln(10) / lambda
# The problem mentions a period-3 orbit, which, by the "Period three implies chaos"
# theorem, tells us the system is chaotic. We use the canonical Lyapunov exponent
# for the logistic map's fully developed chaos (at r=4), which is lambda = ln(2).

# --- Calculation ---

# Value of lambda, the Lyapunov exponent
lyapunov_exponent = math.log(2)

# Calculate T(n,p)
# The formula T = p * ln(10) / lambda does not explicitly depend on n.
# The value n=3 is used to establish that the system is chaotic.
T_np = p * math.log(10) / lyapunov_exponent

# Calculate the final quantity requested by the problem
result = math.ceil(T_np / 12)

# --- Output ---
