The best move for White is a8=Q.

Here is the step-by-step thinking:

1.  **Identify the Core Advantage:** White's most powerful asset is the pawn on a7, which is about to promote. This is the central theme of the position.

2.  **Evaluate the Most Forcing Move:** The most direct way to capitalize on this advantage is to promote the pawn immediately. The move `1. a8=Q` forces a response from Black.

3.  **Analyze the Consequence:** After `1. a8=Q`, Black has no choice but to play `1... Nxa8`. If Black does not capture the new queen, White will win easily.

4.  **Assess the New Position:** After the exchange `1. a8=Q Nxa8`, the board looks like this:
    - White: King on e3, Knight on d3, pawn on b3.
    - Black: King on f5, Knight on a8, pawns on c6, e6, g4.
    - The black knight is now on a8, which is a terrible square. It is completely out of the game and cannot help defend Black's other weaknesses.

5.  **Formulate White's Winning Plan:** White's king and knight are centrally located and can now systematically attack Black's weak pawns. A good follow-up move is `2. Nc5`, which attacks the e6-pawn and improves the knight's position. White will win the resulting endgame.

6.  **Compare with Other Options:** Other moves like Nc5, Kd4, or Kf2 are too slow. They allow Black to react with `1... Na8`, and then White will promote anyway. Promoting immediately (`a8=Q`) is the most efficient and powerful continuation, leaving Black with no good options.

The final winning move is the promotion:
