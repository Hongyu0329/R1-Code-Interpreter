    This function analyzes the network transformation problem and identifies the correct statement.

    The problem describes transforming a Watts-Strogatz (WS) graph into an ultra-small-world (USW) network.
    - Initial WS graph: Average path length L ~ log(n), degrees are all close to k0=6.
    - Target USW graph: Average path length L ~ log(log(n)).
    - Transformation: A series of m(n) edge rewiring operations.
    - Constraints: Final clustering C >= 0.3, min_degree >= 3, max_degree <= log(n).

    Reasoning steps:
    1. Achieving L ~ log(log(n)) from L ~ log(n) requires a fundamental change in the graph's structure. The canonical structure for a USW network is a scale-free network with a power-law degree distribution.
    2. To transform the initial regular-like degree distribution (all degrees ~6) into a skewed power-law distribution, a significant number of degrees must be redistributed. We need to create low-degree nodes (d < 6) and high-degree "hub" nodes (d > 6).
    3. Let Delta_minus be the total degree reduction required. This is the sum of (6 - d_i) for all nodes i where the final degree d_i is less than 6.
    4. Each rewiring operation removes one edge, which has two endpoints. This operation can reduce the degrees of at most two nodes. Therefore, to achieve a total degree reduction of Delta_minus, we need at least Delta_minus / 2 edge removal operations. So, m(n) >= Delta_minus / 2.
    5. The question becomes estimating the minimum necessary Delta_minus. To create a robust hub-and-spoke like structure required for USW, a substantial fraction of nodes must have their degrees altered.
    6. Option H suggests m(n) >= n/6. Let's see what this implies.
       m(n) >= n/6  =>  Delta_minus / 2 >= n/6  =>  Delta_minus >= n/3.
    7. This means the total degree donated by nodes that become low-degree must be at least n/3. Given the scale of the structural change needed to reduce path length scaling from log(n) to log(log(n)), this is a very plausible and quantitative lower bound. The number 6 (from k0) in the denominator suggests a direct relationship with the initial graph parameters.
    8. Let's analyze other key options:
        - (B) m(n) in Theta(n): This is implied by H and is almost certainly correct, but H is more specific.
        - (F) Power-law distribution: This is the mechanism to get a USW, but stating it's the *only* way might be too strong. The answer is likely a property of the transformation itself.
        - (J) Densely connected core of Theta(log n) vertices: A core is needed, but a size of Theta(log n) combined with the max degree constraint of log(n) leads to contradictions. The core cannot be large enough to be Theta(log n) and still connect effectively to the rest of the graph.

    Conclusion: Option H provides the most specific, plausible, and justifiable quantitative statement about the minimum number of required operations, m(n).
