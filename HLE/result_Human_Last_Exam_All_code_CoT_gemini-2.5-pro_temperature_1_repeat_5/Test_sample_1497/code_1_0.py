def solve_violin_puzzle():
    """
    This function determines the parameter group changes for different violin playing variations.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  'sul ponticello' (bowing near the bridge) emphasizes high harmonics. The parameter 'Î½' (group ii) controls the harmonic decay.
    2.  A bridge mute adds mass, which dampens and lowers the frequency of high-frequency body resonances. This affects 'f_2' (group iv), lowering its value.
    3.  Helium changes the speed of sound, which shifts the frequency of the instrument's air-cavity resonances, represented by 'f_1' (group iii).
    4.  Changing from the A string to the E string alters the fundamental frequency of the open string, which is parameter 'F' (group i).

    The function assembles and prints the final answer in the specified format.
