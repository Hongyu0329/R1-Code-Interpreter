    "I will identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice by compiling a list of notable French vessels lost during that specific timeframe due to U-boat actions. I will then use a Python script to process this data.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a list of dictionaries in Python. Each dictionary will represent a significant French ship sunk by a U-boat or a U-boat-laid mine between September 1939 and June 22, 1940. The data for each ship will include its name, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) as a measure of size, and the date it was sunk.\n2.  The script will iterate through this list to compare the GRT of each vessel.\n3.  It will identify and store the ship with the highest GRT.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the name and tonnage of each candidate ship, clearly showing the comparison, and then declare the largest one as the answer.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# A list of notable French ships sunk by German U-boats (or their mines)\n# between the start of the war and the armistice of 22 June 1940.\n# GRT (Gross Register Tonnage) is used as a standard measure of a ship's size.\nships_sunk = [\n    {'name': 'Pacifique', 'tonnage': 9474, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1939, 9, 15)},\n    {'name': 'Bretagne (cargo)', 'tonnage': 10108, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1939, 10, 14)},\n    {'name': 'Louisiane', 'tonnage': 6903, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1939, 10, 17)},\n    {'name': 'Flandre', 'tonnage': 8010, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 2, 13)},\n    {'name': 'Brazza', 'tonnage': 10387, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 5, 28)},\n    {'name': 'Champlain', 'tonnage': 28124, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 6, 17)},\n]\n\n# Initialize a variable to hold the largest ship found so far.\n# Start with the first ship in the list.\nlargest_ship = ships_sunk[0]\n\nprint(\"Comparing the tonnage of French ships sunk by U-boats before the 1940 armistice:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Iterate through the list of ships to find the one with the maximum tonnage.\nfor ship in ships_sunk:\n    # Print each ship's details to show the comparison.\n    print(f\"Ship: {ship['name']:<20} Tonnage: {ship['tonnage']:>5} GRT\")\n    \n    # Compare the current ship's tonnage with the largest one found so far.\n    if ship['tonnage'] > largest_ship['tonnage']:\n        largest_ship = ship\n\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\nprint(f\"The largest ship found is the {largest_ship['name']} with a tonnage of {largest_ship['tonnage']} GRT.\")\nprint(\"\\nThis passenger liner struck a mine laid by the German submarine U-65 off La Rochelle on June 17, 1940.\")\nprint(\"While its GRT was 28,124, its full load displacement was approximately 30,500 tons, making it the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the armistice.\")\n\n```\n<<<Champlain"
