    "To determine the rule activation level for an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we apply a t-norm operation to combine the antecedent's firing level, `Phi_k(x′)`, and the consequent's membership degree, `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n\nA t-norm generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy logic. The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator. I will use the minimum t-norm for this calculation.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1.  Define the input values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm: `activation_level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`.\n3.  Calculate the result.\n4.  Print the full equation and the final value.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_g = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level (w_k) is calculated using a t-norm.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_g)\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation with the result\nprint(\"The rule activation level w_k(x') is calculated using the minimum t-norm as follows:\")\nprint(f\"w_k(x') = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"w_k(x') = min({phi_k}, {mu_g}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
