    "To determine the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2, we can use a fundamental theorem from the theory of integral quadratic forms and lattices. This theorem places strong constraints on the possible values of the determinant of an even lattice based on its dimension.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  State the relevant theorem that connects the dimension and determinant of an even lattice.\n2.  Identify the parameters given in the problem: dimension `n = 17` and determinant `d = 2`.\n3.  Check the dimension `n=17` modulo 8 to determine which case of the theorem applies.\n4.  Apply the condition from the theorem to the determinant `d=2`.\n5.  If the condition is violated, no such lattice can exist, and the number is 0. If the condition is met, further analysis would be needed, but in this case, a violation is expected.\n\nThe Python code below will execute this plan, checking the given parameters against the theorem and printing the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef count_lattices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17\n    and determinant 2 by checking against a known mathematical theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    dimension = 17\n    determinant = 2\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the existence of a positive definite even lattice with dimension n = {dimension} and determinant d = {determinant}.\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We will use a theorem concerning the determinants of even lattices.\")\n    print(\"Theorem: For an even lattice of odd dimension n, its determinant d must satisfy one of the following conditions:\")\n    print(\"  1.
