print("Conclusion: Yes, in both cases, the PFU count is lower when the RP system is present. This indicates that the RP system increases the resistance of the bacteria against the phage.\n")

# Step 2: Analyze the role of the phage's XY operon

print("To determine this, we compare the two phages in the presence of the RP defense system.")
print(f"Against bacteria with the RP system, the wild-type phage (with XY) achieved {pfu_wt_with_rp} PFU.")
print(f"Against the same bacteria, the deltaXY phage (without XY) only achieved {pfu_delta_with_rp} PFU.")
print("Conclusion: The phage with the XY operon is more effective at overcoming the RP defense system. Therefore, the XY operon codes for a counter-defense mechanism.\n")

# Step 3: Analyze the origin of the 500 Da molecule
print("Step 3: What conditions are required to produce the 500 Da molecule?")
print("The mass spectrometry results show the 500 Da molecule was only 'Detected' in Sample 1.")
print("Sample 1's conditions were: Bacteria with the RP system infected with the wild-type phage (PhageDE3-wt).")
print("Conclusion: The production of the 500 Da molecule requires the presence of BOTH the bacterial RP system AND the phage's XY operon. This strongly suggests the enzymes from the XY operon synthesize the 500 Da molecule using a substrate provided by the RP system.\n")

# Step 4: Synthesize and Evaluate
print("Step 4: Evaluating the answer choices based on the full picture.")
print("Statement H says: 'System RP increases the resistance of the bacteria against phageDE3 because the enzymes XY1 or XY2 can synthesize their products only in the presence of the system RP.'")
print("\nLet's check the two parts of this statement:")
print(f"1. 'System RP increases the resistance...' -> This is confirmed in Step 1. The PFU for the deltaXY phage, for example, dropped from {pfu_delta_no_rp} to {pfu_delta_with_rp}.")
print(f"2. '...because the enzymes XY1 or XY2 can synthesize their products only in the presence of the system RP.' -> This is confirmed in Step 3. The 500 Da molecule, the product, was only detected with both components present.")
print("\nThis statement correctly links the bacterial defense (RP system) with the phage's counter-defense (XY operon), which depends on the presence of the bacterial defense system to function. It provides the most complete explanation for the results of both experiments.")
