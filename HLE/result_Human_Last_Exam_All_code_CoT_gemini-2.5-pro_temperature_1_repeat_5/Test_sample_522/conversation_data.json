    "My plan to solve this puzzle is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** I will first examine the provided input-output pairs (A and B) to understand the rule governing the transformation. I'll represent the comma-separated strings as grids of digits to make spatial relationships clearer.\n2.  **Identify the Core Rule:** The key change in both examples involves the number '2'. A '2' at one position becomes a '0', and a '0' at another position becomes a '2'. I'll focus on figuring out how the new position for the '2' is selected.\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** Based on the examples, the '2' seems to move to a neighboring '0'.\n    *   In Example A, the '2' at `(1,1)` moves to `(0,0)`, which is a diagonal neighbor.\n    *   In Example B, the '2' at `(3,6)` moves to `(2,7)`, which is also a diagonal neighbor.\n    *   This suggests the rule involves moving to a diagonal '0'.\n4.  **Refine the Hypothesis:** In Example B, there are two diagonal '0's available. The '2' moves to the one that comes last in reading order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right). This selection rule perfectly explains both examples.\n5.  **Apply the Rule to Input C:** I will apply this confirmed rule to `Input_C`. I will locate the '2', find all its diagonal neighbors that are '0', choose the one that is last in reading order, and perform the transformation.\n6.  **Generate the Final Code:** I will write a Python script that implements these steps to calculate the `MISSING` value for `Input_C` and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by transforming the input grid based on a derived rule.\n    The rule is:\n    1.
