def find_unlikely_tribes():

    Identifies insect tribes whose immatures are unlikely to be collected
    using a beat-sheet method based on their life history.

    The beat-sheet method is effective for collecting insects on the exterior of plants.
    It is not effective for immatures that are:
    - Endophytic (living inside plants, e.g., borers)
    - Soil-dwelling
    - Living in nests/hives
    - Living in decaying organic matter
