    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a breakdown of the best synthesis method and a supporting script to illustrate the reasoning.\n\n### **Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Goal:** The user wants to synthesize a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide which is relatively long. Crucially, this peptide must contain an unnatural amino acid (UAA), specifically azido phenylalanine (AzF).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Strategies:**\n    *   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is the workhorse method for making peptides. You build the peptide one amino acid at a time on a solid resin support. Incorporating the AzF is straightforward by using a protected version of it (e.g., Fmoc-AzF). However, SPPS has a major drawback for long peptides. Even with a high efficiency of 99% for each amino acid addition, the cumulative yield after 99 steps for a 100aa peptide would be (0.99)^99, which is only about 37%. In practice, efficiencies can be lower, leading to extremely low yields and a final product that is very difficult to purify.\n    *   **Recombinant Protein Expression:** This uses a host organism like *E. coli* to produce the peptide. While great for long canonical proteins, it cannot incorporate UAAs by default. A specialized and complex technique called **genetic code expansion** is required, which involves engineering custom tRNAs and tRNA synthetases. This is a powerful method, but it can be time-consuming to set up and optimize.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This is a powerful chemical biology technique designed specifically to create large peptides and proteins. It solves the length problem of SPPS by breaking the synthesis into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\n3.  **Select the Most Helpful Technique:**\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** is the most suitable technique for this task.\n    *   **How it works:**\n        1.  The 100aa target peptide is split into two or more smaller fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments).\n        2.  These shorter fragments are synthesized independently using standard SPPS, which is highly efficient and pure for this size. The azido phenylalanine (AzF) is incorporated into the appropriate fragment during its synthesis.\n        3.  The purified fragments are then chemically joined (\"ligated\") together in solution to form the final, full-length 100aa peptide.\n    *   **Why it's best:** This approach bypasses the cumulative yield problem of direct SPPS, resulting in a much higher yield and purity of the final product. It is a robust and well-established method for creating semi-synthetic proteins containing unnatural amino acids.\n\n4.  **Create a Supporting Script:**\n    *   To quantitatively demonstrate why direct 100aa SPPS is not feasible and why a method like NCL is necessary, I will provide a Python script.\n    *   The script will calculate the theoretical maximum yield of a 100aa peptide using direct SPPS, showing how dramatically the yield drops with even tiny decreases in per-step efficiency. This provides a clear justification for choosing NCL.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spps_yield(peptide_length, coupling_efficiency_percent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the theoretical maximum yield for Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).\n    \n    This function demonstrates how cumulative efficiency losses make it difficult\n    to synthesize long peptides directly.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of coupling reactions is one less than the number of amino acids.\n    num_couplings = peptide_length - 1\n    \n    # Convert the efficiency from a percentage to a decimal fraction.\n    efficiency_decimal = coupling_efficiency_percent / 100.0\n    \n    # The overall theoretical yield is the efficiency raised to the power of the number of couplings.\n    overall_yield_fraction = efficiency_decimal ** num_couplings\n    \n    # Convert the final yield to a percentage for easier interpretation.\n    overall_yield_percent = overall_yield_fraction * 100\n    \n    # Print the parameters and the equation used for the calculation.\n    print(f\"Calculating for a {peptide_length}aa peptide with {coupling_efficiency_percent}% per-step efficiency:\")\n    print(f\"The equation for overall yield is: (Per-Step Efficiency) ^ (Number of Couplings)\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {overall_yield_percent:.2f}% = ({efficiency_decimal}) ^ ({num_couplings}) * 100\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# --- Main Script ---\n# Define the length of the peptide from the problem.\npeptide_length = 100\n\nprint(f\"### SPPS Yield Calculation for a {peptide_length}-Amino-Acid Peptide ###\\n\")\nprint(\"This script shows why direct synthesis of long peptides is inefficient,\")\nprint(\"making a method like Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) a better choice.\\n\")\n\n# Case 1: An extremely optimistic, near-perfect coupling efficiency.\ncalculate_spps_yield(peptide_length, 99.5)\n\n# Case 2: A more standard, excellent coupling efficiency.\ncalculate_spps_yield(peptide_length, 99.0)\n\n# Case 3: A good, but more realistic, coupling efficiency.\ncalculate_spps_yield(peptide_length, 98.0)\n\nprint(\"\\nAs shown, even with excellent per-step efficiency, the final yield for a 100aa peptide is very low.\")\nprint(\"NCL overcomes this by ligating shorter, high-yield fragments.\")\n\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
