# This problem is a known result from the field of harmonic analysis.
# The inequality described is a reverse square function estimate for the light cone in R^3.
# The best exponent alpha is a piecewise linear function of 1/p for p > 2.
# The points where the slope of alpha(1/p) changes are called critical exponents.
# These critical exponents correspond to changes in the geometry of the extremal functions.

# For the cone in R^3, there are two critical exponents for p > 2.
# One is related to the Tomas-Stein restriction theorem.
critical_exponent_1 = 4

# The other is related to the bilinear restriction theorem.
critical_exponent_2 = 3

# The problem states that one of the critical exponents is 4.
# We are asked to find the other one.
print("The given critical exponent is:", critical_exponent_1)
