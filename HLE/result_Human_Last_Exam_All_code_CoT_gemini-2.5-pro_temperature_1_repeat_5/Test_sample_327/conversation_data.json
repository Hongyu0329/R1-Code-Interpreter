    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Decompose the Number**: First, we separate the number into its integer and fractional parts.\n    $\\frac{13}{16} = 0 + \\frac{13}{16}$.\n    The integer part is 0, which requires 0 pieces.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Fractional Part**: The fractional part is $\\frac{13}{16}$. In Hackenbush, dyadic rational fractions (fractions where the denominator is a power of 2) are represented by a single stack of pieces. The denominator is $16 = 2^4$. The number of pieces in the stack is determined by the power of 2 in the denominator, which is 4 in this case.\n\n3.  **Determine the Colors (for completeness)**: The specific colors (red for '1', blue for '0') are determined by the binary representation of the fraction. We convert the numerator (13) to a 4-bit binary number (since the denominator is $2^4$).\n    $13$ in binary is $1101_2$.\n    So, $\\frac{13}{16}$ is $0.1101$ in binary.\n    This corresponds to a stack of four pieces, from bottom to top: Red, Red, Blue, Red.\n\n4.  **Count the Total Pieces**:\n    *   Pieces for the integer part (0): 0\n    *   Pieces for the fractional part ($\\frac{13}{16}$): 4\n    *   Total pieces = 0 + 4 = 4.\n\nThe following Python code automates this calculation and provides a step-by-step explanation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces to represent a dyadic rational\n    in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = 13\n    denominator = 16\n\n    print(f\"To find the number of pieces for the number {numerator}/{denominator}, we follow these steps:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Decompose the number into integer and fractional parts.\n    integer_part = numerator // denominator\n    fractional_numerator = numerator % denominator\n\n    print(f\"1.
