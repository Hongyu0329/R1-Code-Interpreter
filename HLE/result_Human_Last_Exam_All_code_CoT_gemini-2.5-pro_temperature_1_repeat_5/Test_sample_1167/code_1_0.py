# The problem is to find the real number alpha where the best upper bound of |X| is closest to N^alpha.
# Let the trigonometric sum be S(x,t).
# X = {x in [0, 1]: exists t such that |S(x,t)| > N^(3/8)}
# By Chebyshev's inequality with p=2:
# |X| <= (N^(3/8))^(-2) * integral_0^1 max_t|S(x,t)|^2 dx
# |X| <= N^(-3/4) * integral_0^1 max_t|S(x,t)|^2 dx

# The integral is the squared L^2 norm of a maximal function related to the parabola.
# A key result in harmonic analysis (the sharp restriction estimate, proven by Bourgain-Demeter) states:
# integral_0^1 max_t|S(x,t)|^2 dx is approximately bounded by N^epsilon * sum(|a_n|^2).
# Given sum(|a_n|^2) = 1, the integral is bounded by N^epsilon for any epsilon > 0.

# So, |X| <= N^(-3/4) * N^epsilon = N^(-3/4 + epsilon).
# This implies that the exponent alpha is -3/4.
