    "To find the index of the boundary-value problem, we need to determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Boundary Conditions:**\n    The problem provides the following six boundary conditions:\n    1.  $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n    2.  $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    3.  $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    4.  $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    5.  $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0$\n    6.  $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$\n\n2.  **Analyze for Linear Dependence:**\n    We need to check if any of these conditions are redundant (i.e., can be derived from the others).\n    *   Let's focus on the conditions involving $x_2(t)$: conditions 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n    *   Condition 3, $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0$, can be rewritten as $5 \\times (x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$. This is just 5 times condition 2 and is therefore linearly dependent on it.\n    *   Condition 4, $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0$, is 100 times condition 2. It's also linearly dependent.\n    *   Condition 5, $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0$, can be rewritten as $-1000 \\times (x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$. This is -1000 times condition 2 and is also linearly dependent.\n    *   So, conditions 2, 3, 4, and 5 all represent the same single constraint on $x_2(t)$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Linearly Independent Conditions:**\n    After removing the redundant conditions, we are left with a set of linearly independent constraints:\n    *   Condition 1: $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$. This constrains the variable $x_1$.\n    *   The single unique condition for $x_2$: $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$. This constrains the variable $x_2$.\n    *   Condition 6: $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$. This constrains the variable $x_{2024}$.\n\n    These three resulting conditions are linearly independent because they each constrain a different component of the state vector $x(t)$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    There are 3 linearly independent boundary conditions. Therefore, the index of the problem is 3. The dimensions of the matrix $A$ and vector $I(t)$ (202000) do not affect this calculation, as the index only depends on the boundary conditions.\n\nThe following Python code uses `numpy` to create the coefficient matrix for the boundary conditions and calculates its rank to computationally verify our result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem by determining the\n    number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The index of a Boundary Value Problem is the number of linearly independent \n    # boundary conditions.
