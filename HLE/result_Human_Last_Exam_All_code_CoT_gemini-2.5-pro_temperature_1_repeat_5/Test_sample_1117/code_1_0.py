    # Step 1: Describe the initial state of the endohedral fullerene.
    print("Initial State: In Ce2@C80, two Cerium (Ce) atoms are trapped inside a C80 fullerene cage.")
    print("The Ce atoms donate electrons to the cage and become positively charged ions.")
    print("The negative charge on the cage is delocalized, allowing the Ce ions to move freely inside.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Step 2: Describe the chemical reaction.
    print("Reaction: The disilirane adds to the OUTSIDE of the C80 cage.")
    print("This is an exohedral functionalization, forming covalent bonds with the cage's carbon atoms.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Explain the effect on the fullerene cage.
    print("Effect on Cage: The external addition disrupts the delocalized electronic system of the C80 cage.")
    print("This creates a non-uniform distribution of charge on the cage's surface.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 4: Explain the final effect on the internal cerium atoms.
    print("Effect on Cerium Atoms: The non-uniform charge inside the cage creates new, stable low-energy positions.")
    print("The free random motion of the Ce ions stops.")
    print("The two Ce ions align themselves along the new axis defined by the external group.")
    print("One Ce ion moves near the addition site, and the other moves to the opposite end.")
    print("This configuration corresponds to the Ce atoms being positioned at the poles of the fullerene.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Step 5: Conclude with the correct answer choice.
    print("Conclusion: The reaction causes the cerium atoms to become fixed at the poles of the fullerene.")
    print("The correct answer is E.")
