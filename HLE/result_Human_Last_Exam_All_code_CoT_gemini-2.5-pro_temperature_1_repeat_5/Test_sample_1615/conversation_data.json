    "This problem can be solved using a well-known result from graph theory concerning the chromatic number of a graph.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to find the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph ($K_{12345}$).\n2.  **Recall relevant theorems:**\n    *   For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$. This maximum, $\\chi(G)=n$, is only achieved by the complete graph $K_n$.\n    *   Since the graph $G$ in the problem is explicitly not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than $n$.\n    *   A theorem by L. Lovász states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most $n-1$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n3.  **Verify the maximum:** To confirm that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1$ colors.\n    *   Consider a graph constructed by taking a complete subgraph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and adding one more vertex that is not connected to any other vertex (an isolated vertex).\n    *   This graph has $n$ vertices in total and is not complete.\n    *   The $K_{n-1}$ part requires $n-1$ distinct colors. The isolated vertex can be colored using any of these $n-1$ colors.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatic number of this graph is exactly $n-1$.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The maximum chromatic number for a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices is $n-1$.\n5.  **Implementation:** Write a Python script to state this reasoning and calculate the result for $n=12345$. The script will print the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a non-complete\n    graph with a given number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # Step-by-step explanation\n    print(\"This problem asks for the maximum chromatic number (χ(G)) of a graph G with 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere's the reasoning:\")\n    print(\"1.
