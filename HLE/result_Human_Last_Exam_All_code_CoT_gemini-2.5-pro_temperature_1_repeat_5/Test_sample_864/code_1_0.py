    Calculates and prints the whitening filter W(D) based on a corrected version of the problem.
    
    The original problem statement for the sequence q_k leads to an invalid power spectral density.
    This function operates on a corrected set of coefficients that form a valid, factorizable polynomial Q(D).

    Corrected sequence assumption:
    q_0 = 3
    q_1 = q_-1 = 2
    q_2 = q_-2 = 2/3
    q_k = 0 for |k| > 2

    This leads to Q(D) = (1/3) * (2*D**-2 + 6*D**-1 + 9 + 6*D + 2*D**2).
    The minimum-phase spectral factor is F(D) = (1/sqrt(3)) * (1 + 2*D + 2*D**2).
    The whitening filter that results in a causal channel is W(D) = 1 / F(D**-1).
    W(D) = 1 / [ (1/sqrt(3)) * (1 + 2*D**-1 + 2*D**-2) ]
