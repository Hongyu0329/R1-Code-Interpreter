    "Based on the principles of crystallography, a crystal class can exhibit optical activity if it lacks a center of inversion. To find the classes that are also achiral and non-polar, we apply the following filters:\n\n1.  **Condition for Optical Activity**: The crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric (lacks a center of inversion, ī).\n2.  **Condition for being Achiral**: The crystal class must possess an improper rotation axis (e.g., a mirror plane `m`, or a rotoinversion axis like `4̄`). This is equivalent to not being in the set of 11 purely chiral classes.\n3.  **Condition for being Non-polar**: The crystal class must not belong to the 10 pyroelectric (polar) classes.\n\nThe following Python code identifies the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions. It defines sets of classes based on these physical properties and finds the intersection that matches the user's request.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies achiral, non-polar crystal classes that are optically active.\n    Hermann-Mauguin notation is used for the point groups.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 32 crystallographic point groups\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Condition 1: Optically active -> Must be non-centrosymmetric\n    # The 11 centrosymmetric classes (possess a center of inversion) are not optically active.\n    centrosymmetric_classes = {\n        '-1', '2/m', 'mmm', '4/m', '4/mmm', '-3', '-3m', '6/m', '6/mmm', 'm-3', 'm-3m'\n    }\n    optically_active_classes = all_classes - centrosymmetric_classes\n\n    # Condition 2: Achiral -> Must possess an improper rotation axis (m, -1, -3, -4, -6)\n    # A class is achiral if it's not in the set of 11 purely chiral classes.\n    chiral_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'\n    }\n    achiral_classes = all_classes - chiral_classes\n\n    # Condition 3: Non-polar -> Must not be in the set of 10 pyroelectric classes.\n    polar_classes = {\n        '1', '2', 'm', 'mm2', '3', '3m', '4', '4mm', '6', '6mm'\n    }\n    non_polar_classes = all_classes - polar_classes\n\n    # Find the intersection of all three conditions\n    result_set = optically_active_classes.intersection(achiral_classes).intersection(non_polar_classes)\n\n    # Sort for a clean, ordered output\n    result_list = sorted(list(result_set))\n\n    print(\"The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\")\n    for cls in result_list:\n        print(cls)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_crystal_classes()\n```\n<<<-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m>>>"
