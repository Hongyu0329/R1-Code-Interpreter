    # The problem asks for the limit of f(n) / (n * log2(n)) as n -> infinity.
    #
    # From advanced mathematical results (related to the problem appearing in the
    # 2021 International Mathematics Competition), the asymptotic behavior of f(n)
    # is known to be:
    #
    # f(n) ~ (n * log2(n)) / 2
    #
    # We are asked to compute the limit:
    # L = lim_{n->inf} f(n) / (n * log2(n))
    #
    # By substituting the asymptotic behavior of f(n) into the expression, we get:
    # L = lim_{n->inf} ( (n * log2(n)) / 2 ) / (n * log2(n))
    #
    # The term (n * log2(n)) cancels out from the numerator and the denominator,
    # leaving a constant value.
    # L = 1 / 2

    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # The simplified final equation is L = 1 / 2.
