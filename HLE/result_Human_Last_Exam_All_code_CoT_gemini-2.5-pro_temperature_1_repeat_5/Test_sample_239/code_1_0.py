# Final Answer Code
# This script calculates the answers to the four questions and prints them in the required format.

# Question 1: How many lines of code have compiler errors?
# Based on analysis of the XVM specification:
# - Line 3: `unsigned long long` is an invalid type.
# - Line 4: `scanf` uses the wrong format specifier (`%d` instead of `%l`).
# - Line 9: `printf` uses the wrong format specifier (`%d` instead of `%l`).
answer_q1 = 3

# Question 2: What is the total memory (in D) used for variables in an optimized program?
# The optimized program needs variables for n, m, and a.
# n requires a `long` type (12D).
# m requires a `long` type (12D).
# a requires an `unsigned int` type (6D).
answer_q2 = 12 + 12 + 6

# Question 3: Can this problem be solved without branching statements?
# Yes, by using the integer arithmetic formula for ceiling division.
answer_q3 = "Y"

# Question 4: What is the expected output for m = n = 4*10^9 and a = 1?
n = 4 * 10**9
m = 4 * 10**9
a = 1

# The number of flagstones for one side is the ceiling of the division.
# This can be calculated using integer arithmetic as (dimension + stone_size - 1) // stone_size
num_stones_n = (n + a - 1) // a
num_stones_m = (m + a - 1) // a

# The total number of flagstones is the product of the numbers for each side.
answer_q4 = num_stones_n * num_stones_m

# Assembling the final answer in the format x:y:z:t
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as providing the final calculated value for t.
