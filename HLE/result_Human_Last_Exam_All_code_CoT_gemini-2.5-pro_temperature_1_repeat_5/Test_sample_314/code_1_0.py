    # Part (a): What are the O-definable subsets?
    # An O-definable set must be invariant under all automorphisms of the structure.
    # The translation maps f(x) = x + c for any c in R are automorphisms of M.
    # If a set S is O-definable and non-empty, it must contain some element s.
    # Then for any r in R, f(s) = s + (r-s) = r must also be in S.
    # Thus, any non-empty O-definable set is R itself.
    # The O-definable subsets are therefore the empty set and R.
    part_a = "∅, ℝ"

    # Part (b): Is this o-minimal?
    # A structure is o-minimal if every definable subset of R (with parameters)
    # is a finite union of points and intervals.
    # The set of rational numbers, Q, is definable by the formula V(x, 0).
    # Q is an infinite set of discrete points and not a finite union of points and intervals.
    # Therefore, the structure is not o-minimal.
    part_b = "No"

    # Part (c): Does it admit quantifier elimination?
    # The structure does not admit quantifier elimination.
    # This is because the quantifier-free formulas are not expressive enough
    # to be equivalent to all formulas with quantifiers.
    # For example, a quantifier-free formula cannot distinguish between pairs of points (a, b) and (c, d)
    # that have the same order and V-class relations but different rational distances (e.g., b-a=1 vs d-c=2).
    # A formula with quantifiers can distinguish them, for example, by checking for the existence
    # of other elements or V-classes in the interval between the points.
    # The standard proof involves constructing two tuples with the same quantifier-free type that
    # are distinguished by a formula with quantifiers.
    part_c = "No"

    # Print the final answer in the required format.
