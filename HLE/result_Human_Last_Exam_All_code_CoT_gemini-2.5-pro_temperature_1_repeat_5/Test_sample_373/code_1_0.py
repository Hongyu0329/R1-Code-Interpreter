# Plan Step 1 & 4: Define graph parameters and calculate degrees.
# A barbell graph with 10 nodes has two cliques of 5 nodes each.
total_nodes = 10
nodes_per_clique = total_nodes // 2

# The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge (u, v) have a specific degree.
# Each is connected to (nodes_per_clique - 1) nodes in its own clique, plus 1 node (the other end of the bottleneck).
# For a 5-node clique, this is (5 - 1) + 1 = 5.
degree_u = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1
degree_v = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1

# Plan Step 2 & 3: Formulate the probability calculation.
# The probability of sampling an edge (u,v) in uniform gossiping is:
# P(sampling) = P(picking u) * P(u chooses v) + P(picking v) * P(v chooses u)
# P(picking a node) = 1 / total_nodes
# P(node i chooses neighbor j) = 1 / degree(i)
prob_pick_u_choose_v = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_u)
prob_pick_v_choose_u = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_v)
total_probability = prob_pick_u_choose_v + prob_pick_v_choose_u

# Plan Step 5: Compute and print the final probability.
# The following code will print the explanation, the final equation with numbers, and the result.
# We redirect stdout to stderr for the explanation to keep the final answer clean.
