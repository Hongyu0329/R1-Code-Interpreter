    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Barbell Graph:** First, I'll define the structure of a barbell graph with 10 nodes. This graph consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge, which is known as the \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\".\n2.  **Understand Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** Next, I'll break down the process of sampling an edge via randomized uniform gossiping. This is a two-step process:\n    a. A node `i` is selected uniformly at random from all `N` nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N`.\n    b. The selected node `i` then chooses one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor `j` is `1/d(i)`, where `d(i)` is the degree (number of neighbors) of node `i`.\n3.  **Formulate the Probability Calculation:** An edge `(u, v)` is sampled if node `u` is picked and it chooses `v`, OR if node `v` is picked and it chooses `u`. I will calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge `(u, v)` using the formula:\n    `P(sampling edge (u,v)) = P(pick u) * P(u chooses v) + P(pick v) * P(v chooses u)`\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** I'll determine the degrees of the two nodes `u` and `v` that are connected by the bottleneck edge. Each of these nodes is connected to 4 other nodes within its own 5-node clique, plus the one node in the other clique via the bottleneck edge.\n5.  **Compute the Final Probability:** Finally, I'll substitute all the calculated values (`N`, `d(u)`, `d(v)`) into the probability formula and compute the final answer. The python script will print out the equation with the numbers and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Plan Step 1 & 4: Define graph parameters and calculate degrees.\n# A barbell graph with 10 nodes has two cliques of 5 nodes each.\ntotal_nodes = 10\nnodes_per_clique = total_nodes // 2\n\n# The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge (u, v) have a specific degree.\n# Each is connected to (nodes_per_clique - 1) nodes in its own clique, plus 1 node (the other end of the bottleneck).\n# For a 5-node clique, this is (5 - 1) + 1 = 5.\ndegree_u = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1\ndegree_v = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1\n\n# Plan Step 2 & 3: Formulate the probability calculation.\n# The probability of sampling an edge (u,v) in uniform gossiping is:\n# P(sampling) = P(picking u) * P(u chooses v) + P(picking v) * P(v chooses u)\n# P(picking a node) = 1 / total_nodes\n# P(node i chooses neighbor j) = 1 / degree(i)\nprob_pick_u_choose_v = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_u)\nprob_pick_v_choose_u = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_v)\ntotal_probability = prob_pick_u_choose_v + prob_pick_v_choose_u\n\n# Plan Step 5: Compute and print the final probability.\n# The following code will print the explanation, the final equation with numbers, and the result.\n# We redirect stdout to stderr for the explanation to keep the final answer clean.\nprint(\"To find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph using randomized uniform gossiping, we follow these steps:\", file=sys.stderr)\nprint(\"1.
