    "An element of a reflection group has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is a regular element. For the reflection group of type H3, any regular element can be shown to have an eigenvalue of order 10, which is the Coxeter number for H3. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of regular elements in the group H3.\n\nThe number of regular elements in a finite Coxeter group `W` can be calculated using a formula derived from the work of T.A. Springer. The formula is:\n\nNumber of regular elements = `|W| * phi(h) / h`\n\nwhere:\n*   `|W|` is the order of the group. For H3, the order is 120.\n*   `h` is the Coxeter number. For H3, the Coxeter number is 10.\n*   `phi(h)` is Euler's totient function, which counts the positive integers up to `h` that are relatively prime to `h`.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the parameters for H3: the group order `|W|` and the Coxeter number `h`.\n2.  Calculate `phi(h)`, Euler's totient function for the Coxeter number.\n3.  Apply the formula to find the total number of regular elements.\n4.  Print the full equation that leads to the result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have a regular\n    eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Parameters for the reflection group of type H3\n    group_order = 120  # |W|\n    coxeter_number = 10 # h\n\n    # An element has a regular eigenvector iff it's a regular element.\n    # A regular element in H3 has an eigenvalue of order h=10.\n    # So, we need to find the number of regular elements in H3.\n    # The formula is N = |W| * phi(h) / h, where phi is Euler's totient function.\n\n    # Calculate phi(10)\n    # Integers coprime to 10 are 1, 3, 7, 9. There are 4 such numbers.\n    phi_h = 0\n    for i in range(1, coxeter_number + 1):\n        if math.gcd(i, coxeter_number) == 1:\n            phi_h += 1\n\n    # Calculate the number of regular elements\n    num_regular_elements = group_order * phi_h // coxeter_number\n\n    # Print the final equation as requested\n    print(\"The number of such elements is calculated by the formula for regular elements in a Coxeter group:\")\n    print(\"Number = |W| * phi(h) / h\")\n    print(f\"For H3, the group order |W| is {group_order} and the Coxeter number h is {coxeter_number}.\")\n    print(f\"Euler's totient function phi({coxeter_number}) is {phi_h}.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{group_order} * {phi_h} / {coxeter_number} = {num_regular_elements}\")\n\nsolve_h3_regular_elements()\n```\n<<<48>>>"
