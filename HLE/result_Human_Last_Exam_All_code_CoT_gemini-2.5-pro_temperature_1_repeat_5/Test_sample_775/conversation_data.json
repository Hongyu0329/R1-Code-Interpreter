    "There is no largest number of components for the intersection of the two sets. We can construct two sets `A` and `B` that satisfy the conditions (closed, connected, and their union is the unit square) such that their intersection `A ∩ B` has `N` connected components, for any positive integer `N`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Construction Method:** We will use a \"comb\" or \"finger\" construction.\n    *   Set `A` will be composed of a horizontal bar at the top of the square, with `N` vertical \"fingers\" reaching down from it. This set is closed and connected.\n    *   Set `B` will be the closure of the rest of the square (`B = cl(S \\ A)`). Since the area outside of `A` is connected, `B` will also be a connected set.\n    *   By construction, `A` and `B` are closed and their union is the unit square `S`.\n2.  **Intersection:** The intersection `A ∩ B` is the boundary of `A` within the square. This boundary consists of the sides and bottoms of the `N` fingers. Since the fingers are separated from each other, their boundaries form `N` disjoint components (each shaped like a 'U').\n3.  **Python Implementation:**\n    *   We will write a Python script to model this construction on a grid.\n    *   We'll use `NumPy` to create a grid representing the unit square.\n    *   We will define set `A` for a chosen number of fingers, `N`.\n    *   The intersection `A ∩ B` will be identified as the pixels of `A` that are adjacent to pixels of `B`.\n    *   We will use the `scipy.ndimage.label` function to count the number of disconnected components in the resulting intersection.\n    *   The script will print the number of components, which will be `N`. Since `N` can be any integer, this demonstrates that there is no largest number.\n\nThe following code demonstrates the case for `N=5`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef solve_components(N=5, grid_size=300):\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs two sets A and B in a unit square and counts the\n    components of their intersection.\n\n    Args:\n        N (int): The number of 'fingers' for set A, which will correspond\n                 to the number of components in the intersection.\n        grid_size (int): The resolution of the grid for the unit square.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a grid to represent the square.\n    # 0: Belongs to B only (initially, the whole square is B)\n    # 1: Belongs to A only\n    grid = np.zeros((grid_size, grid_size), dtype=int)\n\n    # --- Define Set A ---\n    # A is a comb-like shape with N fingers.\n\n    # 1.
