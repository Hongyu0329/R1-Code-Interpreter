    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  Analyze the provided quote and clues. The poet is Andrei Voznesensky, a Russian poet. This strongly suggests the subject is a figure from Russian history.\n2.  The description \"joy-discovering sailor\" points towards an explorer or navigator.\n3.  The lines \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" combined with the clue that the answer \"emerged in the late 1980s\" indicates that the person's burial site was lost for a long time and rediscovered or re-identified around that period.\n4.  Voznesensky is famously the author of the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which is about the Russian explorer and diplomat Nikolai Rezanov.\n5.  Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. His original tomb was destroyed in the Soviet era, and its location was lost. Efforts to locate the grave and re-memorialize him took place in the latter half of the 20th century, fitting the timeline.\n6.  Therefore, the man in question is Nikolai Rezanov. The code will print his last name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the historical riddle by identifying the person based on the clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    poet = \"Andrei Voznesensky\"\n    description = \"a joy-discovering sailor\"\n    grave_clue = \"Grave location unknown until the late 1980s\"\n\n    # Andrei Voznesensky wrote the story for \"Juno and Avos,\" a famous Russian rock opera.\n    # The opera is about the life and death of the Russian explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n    # Rezanov's grave was lost after being destroyed and was rediscovered/re-memorialized in the late 20th century.\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\n    print(f\"The poet, {poet}, famously wrote about the Russian explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\")\n    print(f\"This explorer fits the description of a 'sailor' and his grave's location was a mystery for a long time.\")\n    print(f\"The last name of the man is: {last_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
