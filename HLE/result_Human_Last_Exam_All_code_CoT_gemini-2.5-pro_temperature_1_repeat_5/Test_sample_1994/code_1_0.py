    # --- Part 1: Find the number of terms in the sequence ---
    # The problem describes a unique way to represent any number N as a sum of
    # terms of the form: tet(2, a) * pow(2, b).
    # This representation is equivalent to the binary (base-2) expansion of N.
    # Therefore, the number of terms in the sequence is the number of '1's
    # (set bits) in the binary representation of N.

    # N can be written as 10^100 = (2 * 5)^100 = 2^100 * 5^100.
    # Multiplying by 2^100 is equivalent to a left bit-shift of 100 places.
    # This does not change the number of set bits. So, we only need to
    # count the set bits in 5^100.

    # --- Part 2: Find a1 and b1 for the largest term ---
    # The largest term in the sum corresponds to the most significant bit (MSB) of N.
    # The value of this term is 2^k, where k is the exponent of the MSB.
    # k can be calculated as floor(log2(N)), or more easily using N.bit_length() - 1.
    
    k = N.bit_length() - 1
    
    # We now need to represent this single term 2^k in the form:
    # tet(2, a1) * pow(2, b1)
    # This means 2^k = 2^(2^(a1-1)) * 2^(b1), which simplifies to k = 2^(a1-1) + b1.
    
    # To find a1, we use the property that 2^(a1-1) <= k < 2^a1.
    # This means a1 = floor(log2(k)) + 1, which is what k.bit_length() returns.
    
    a1 = k.bit_length()
    
    # With a1 known, we can solve for b1:
    # b1 = k - 2^(a1-1)
    # 1 << (a1 - 1) is an efficient way to calculate 2^(a1-1).
    
    b1 = k - (1 << (a1 - 1))
    
    # --- Final Output ---
    # The problem asks for the count, followed by a1 and b1.
