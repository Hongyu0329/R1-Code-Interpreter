# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# A map graph is planar, so by the Four Color Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 4.
# A 4-clique (e.g., China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India) exists, meaning at least 4 colors are required.
# Therefore, the chromatic number before the dissolution was 4.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph before 1991 was {chromatic_number_before}.")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the dissolution.
# The graph remains planar (so chi <= 4), and the original 4-clique was unaffected.
# Therefore, the chromatic number after the dissolution remained 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph after 1991 is {chromatic_number_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change, delta_soviet.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The change in chromatic number, delta_soviet, is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine if planarity changed to find beta.
# A graph of a map is planar. Subdividing a region preserves planarity.
# The planarity of the Asian country graph did not change.
# As per the instructions, if planarity does not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The graph's planarity did not change, so beta is {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
