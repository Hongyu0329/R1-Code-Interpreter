    print("D. Spin Valve Saturation: Correct. A Spin Valve sensor has an optimal operating magnetic field range. If the magnet is too close, the strong background field will saturate the sensor, making it unable to detect the small magnetic signals from the particles.")

    print("The most critical negative effect from positioning the magnet too close is the saturation of the Spin Valve sensor itself.")
