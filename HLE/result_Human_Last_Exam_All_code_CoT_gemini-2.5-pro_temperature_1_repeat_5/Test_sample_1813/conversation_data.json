    "This problem requires us to compute the continued fraction of a number derived from the generalized Markov equation. The specific number is \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Number:** The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is associated with the quadratic irrational number \\( \\alpha = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{9 - 4(p/q)^2}}{2(p/q)} \\). For \\(p=4\\) and \\(q=7\\), we first need to simplify this expression.\n    *   Substitute \\(p=4, q=7\\): \\( \\alpha = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{9 - 4(16/49)}}{2(4/7)} \\)\n    *   Simplify inside the square root: \\( 9 - \\frac{64}{49} = \\frac{441 - 64}{49} = \\frac{377}{49} \\)\n    *   So, \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{377}{49}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{377}}{7} \\).\n    *   Substitute back: \\( \\alpha = \\frac{3 - \\frac{\\sqrt{377}}{7}}{8/7} = \\frac{(21 - \\sqrt{377})/7}{8/7} = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{377}}{8} \\).\n\n2.  **Continued Fraction Algorithm:** We need to find the continued fraction of \\( \\alpha = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{377}}{8} \\). We can use a standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational number of the form \\( \\frac{c_2 + c_1\\sqrt{D}}{c_3} \\).\n    *   The algorithm proceeds iteratively:\n        1.  Let the current number be \\( \\xi_i \\). Store its state (represented by the coefficients \\(c_1, c_2, c_3\\)) to detect repetition.\n        2.  Calculate the integer part, \\( a_i = \\lfloor \\xi_i \\rfloor \\).\n        3.  The next number in the sequence is \\( \\xi_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{\\xi_i - a_i} \\).\n        4.  Simplify \\( \\xi_{i+1} \\) back to the form \\( \\frac{c'_2 + c'_1\\sqrt{D}}{c'_3} \\) and normalize the coefficients.\n    *   The process continues until a state repeats, which indicates the start of the periodic part of the continued fraction.\n\n3.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations. It will:\n    *   Set up the initial parameters for \\( \\alpha = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{377}}{8} \\), which are \\(D=377\\), \\(c_1=-1\\), \\(c_2=21\\), and \\(c_3=8\\).\n    *   Loop to compute the coefficients \\(a_i\\), storing the states to find the cycle.\n    *   Once the cycle is found, separate the coefficients into the non-repeating (pre-period) and repeating (period) parts.\n    *   Finally, print the results clearly, showing each number that forms the final continued fraction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd_three(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of three integers.\"\"\"\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(a, b), c)\n\ndef compute_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_p/q.\n    \n    The number is alpha = (3q - sqrt(9q^2 - 4p^2)) / (2p).\n    This can be written in the form (c2 + c1*sqrt(D)) / c3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
