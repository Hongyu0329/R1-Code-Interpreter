Step-by-step solution:

1.  **Analyze the Conditions on X:**
    - X is a metric space, which implies it's a Hausdorff space.
    - X is locally compact.
    - X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line (R). This means a continuous bijection f: R -> X exists.

2.  **Apply a Key Topological Theorem:**
    - The domain of the map f, the real line R, is a locally compact Hausdorff space.
    - The codomain, X, is a metric space and thus is also Hausdorff.
    - A fundamental theorem in topology states that a continuous bijection from a locally compact Hausdorff space to another Hausdorff space must be a homeomorphism.
    - Therefore, the map f: R -> X is a homeomorphism.

3.  **Identify the Homeomorphism Class:**
    - Since X is homeomorphic to R, any space X satisfying the conditions must belong to the same homeomorphism class as R.
    - This means there is at most one possible homeomorphism class.

4.  **Verify R as a Valid Space:**
    - We must check if R itself satisfies all the given properties.
    - R is a locally compact metric space and is a one-to-one continuous image of itself (via the identity map).
    - We check the special separation property: For any distinct points x, y in R, can we find a closed, connected set K such that x is in the interior of K and y is not in K?
        - Yes. Let d = |x - y|. Choose K to be the closed interval [x - d/2, x + d/2].
        - K is closed and connected.
        - The interior of K, Int(K) = (x - d/2, x + d/2), contains x.
        - The point y is not in K because its distance from x is d, which is greater than d/2.
    - Since R satisfies all conditions, this one homeomorphism class is indeed a valid solution.

5.  **Final Conclusion:**
    - The properties uniquely determine the space up to homeomorphism to be the real line R.
    - Therefore, there is exactly one such homeomorphism class.
