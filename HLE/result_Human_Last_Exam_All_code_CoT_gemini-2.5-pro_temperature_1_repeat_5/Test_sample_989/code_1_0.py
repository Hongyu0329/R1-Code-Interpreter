These closest points are the support vectors. If all support vectors belonged to one class, the margin would be undefined as there would be no opposing points to define the other side of the 'street'."

            'explanation': "This statement is TRUE. To handle class imbalance, one common technique is to assign different penalty parameters (C1 and C2) for misclassifications in each class. Penalizing the minority class more heavily can lead to an optimal solution where the margin is smaller (i.e., 'pushed' closer) on the majority class side, effectively creating unequal margins to better classify the rare samples."

            'explanation': "This statement is TRUE. This is the main benefit of the 'kernel trick'. For example, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, K(x, y) = exp(-gamma * ||x - y||^2), corresponds to a mapping into an infinite-dimensional feature space. However, we never compute the mapping explicitly; we only compute the kernel function's value, which is computationally efficient."

            'explanation': "This statement is TRUE. The position of the decision boundary is determined exclusively by the support vectors (the points on or inside the margin). Points that are correctly classified and lie outside the margin are called interior points. Adding, removing, or moving these points will not change the solution as long as they do not cross the margin and become support vectors."

A simple counterexample is the function f(x) = e^x. This function is strictly convex over the real numbers, but it never attains a minimum value. Its infimum is 0, but there is no x for which f(x) = 0. Therefore, the general statement is not true without additional conditions (e.g., the function's domain is a compact set)."
