    # Choice A is wrong because it includes the neighbours and wrongly states only Lincoln is liable for his actions.
    # Choice B is wrong because it incorrectly joins the liability for two separate incidents.
    # Choice C is wrong because it wrongly states only Lincoln is liable for his actions.
    # Choice D is wrong because it wrongly claims minimal damage results in no liability.
    # Choice E correctly states the liability for both incidents separately.
