    "The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Outer-Hull:** The outer-hull (or convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a standard regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the Faces:** A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron whose faces are already triangles. Therefore, the minimal triangulation of its surface is simply the set of its own faces. The problem then becomes \"How many faces does a regular icosahedron have?\"\n3.  **Use Euler's Formula:** We can determine the number of faces (F) of a convex polyhedron using Euler's formula: `V - E + F = 2`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.\n4.  **Properties of an Icosahedron:** A regular icosahedron has:\n    *   `V = 12` vertices\n    *   `E = 30` edges\n5.  **Calculate F:** We can rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F: `F = 2 - V + E`.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# The outer-hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# A regular icosahedron's surface is already composed of triangles.\n# We can find the number of these triangles (faces) using Euler's formula for convex polyhedra: V - E + F = 2.\n\n# For a regular icosahedron:\n# V (Vertices) = 12\n# E (Edges) = 30\nV = 12\nE = 30\n\n# We rearrange the formula to solve for F (Faces): F = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nprint(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"The number of triangles needed for its triangulation is equal to its number of faces.\")\nprint(\"Using Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2), we can calculate the number of faces (F).\")\nprint(f\"Given V = {V} vertices and E = {E} edges:\")\nprint(\"The equation to find the number of faces is: F = 2 - V + E\")\nprint(f\"Substituting the values: F = 2 - {V} + {E}\")\nprint(f\"Result: F = {F}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, the minimal number of triangles is {F}.\")\n\n```\n<<<20>>>"
