    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("We compare a mouse with the 'xy' gene (wtL) to a mouse without it (-xyL), when both are infected with a pathogen that cannot defend against 'xy'.")
    print("The pathogen mutant 'ΔAΔB' is used because, as we'll see, A and B are the factors that normally disable the 'xy' product.")
    print("Equation 1: In a normal mouse (wtL), infection with ΔAΔB pathogen results in 3000 bacteria.")
    print("Equation 2: In a knockout mouse (-xyL), infection with the same ΔAΔB pathogen results in 5000 bacteria.")
    print(f"Conclusion: The presence of the 'xy' gene product reduces the bacterial count from 5000 to 3000. Therefore, the 'xy' gene product is a host defense factor that fights the infection.\n")

    # Step 2: Determine the function of pathogen virulence factors A and B
    print("Step 2: What is the role of pathogen virulence factors A and B?")
    print("-------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("In a normal mouse (wtL), removing pathogen factors A and B (mutant ΔAΔB) drops the bacterial count from 5000 to 3000.")
    print("This drop (5000 -> 3000) is caused by the now-active 'xy' host defense (from Step 1).")
    print("This implies that the normal job of pathogen factors A and B is to disable the 'xy' host defense.")
    print(f"Conclusion: Virulence factors A and B work together to deactivate the product of the host's 'xy' gene.\n")

    # Step 3: Determine the function of pathogen virulence factor C
    print("Step 3: What is the role of pathogen virulence factor C?")
    print("-------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Let's see what happens when only factor C is removed (mutant ΔC).")
    print("Equation 3: In a normal mouse (wtL), infection with ΔC pathogen results in 3000 bacteria (a drop from 5000).")
    print("Equation 4: In a knockout mouse (-xyL), infection with ΔC pathogen also results in 3000 bacteria (a drop from 5000).")
    print("Conclusion: Since removing C reduces the bacterial count regardless of whether the 'xy' gene is present, factor C must be a virulence factor that targets a different host pathway, one that is not related to the 'xy' gene product.\n")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the final answer choices
    print("Step 4: Evaluating the best answer choice.")
    print("---------------------------------------------")

    print("- Part 1: 'Virulence factor B deactivates the product of gene xy.' This is TRUE (as determined in Step 2, B works with A to do this).")
    print("- Part 2: 'virulence factor C does not target the same host proteins as virulence factor A.' This is TRUE. Factor A targets the 'xy' product (Step 2), while factor C targets a different pathway (Step 3).")
