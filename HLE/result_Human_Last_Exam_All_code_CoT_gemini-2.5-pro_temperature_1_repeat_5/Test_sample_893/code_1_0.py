# Here is the Python code that prints the final answer.
# The reasoning for each letter is as follows:
# A -> N: For any H-free graph G, G plus an isolated vertex is a strictly larger H-free graph.
# B -> Y: Any non-empty finite subset of real numbers has a maximum, which is a maximal element.
# C -> D: The set {1-1/n} has no maximal element, while {-n} does. Both are countable and discrete.
# D -> Y: Uncountable discrete subsets of R do not exist, so the statement is vacuously true for this empty class of sets.
# E -> Y: The order is a <= b if b is a subsequence of a. A constant sequence (c, c, ...) is maximal.
# F -> N: The order is a <= b if a is a subsequence of b. For any sequence, a strictly larger one can be constructed (a proper supersequence), so no sequence is maximal.
