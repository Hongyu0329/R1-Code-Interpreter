    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the nature of the integral equation. The kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be expanded as a finite sum `∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`. This is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, which means the integral equation can be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Represent the solution `u(x)` in terms of a set of unknown constants `c_k`, where `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. This shows that `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`.\n2.  Substitute this form of `u(x)` back into the definitions of `c_k` to derive a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` constants `c_k`.\n3.  This system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where `A` is an `n x n` matrix, `c` is the vector of unknown constants, and `b` is a known vector.\n4.  According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system has no solution if the determinant of the matrix `(I - λA)` is zero, and the vector `b` is not in the range of `(I - λA)`.\n5.  The condition `det(I - λA) = 0` means that `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. Let's call the eigenvalues of `A` as `μ`. So, `λ = 1/μ`.\n6.  The second condition (that `b` is not in the range) needs to be checked for each eigenvalue. We can do this by checking if `b` is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix `(I - λA)ᵀ`. This condition is equivalent to checking if the integral of the corresponding homogeneous solution `v(x)` over `[0, 1]` is non-zero.\n7.  We can write a Python script to construct the matrix `A` for a given `n`, compute its eigenvalues `μ` and eigenvectors, check the condition for each eigenvalue, and then calculate the corresponding values of `λ = 1/μ`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It takes the integer `n` as a command-line argument. For any given `n`, it prints the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solution.\n\n    The integral equation is:\n    u(x) = 1 + lambda * integral_0^1 (x^n - y^n)/(x - y) * u(y) dy\n\n    This is reduced to a system of linear equations (I - lambda*A)c = b.\n    No solution exists if lambda = 1/mu, where mu is an eigenvalue of A,\n    and a condition based on the Fredholm alternative is met.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent in the integral equation's kernel.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of values of lambda for which there is no solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n\n    # 1.
