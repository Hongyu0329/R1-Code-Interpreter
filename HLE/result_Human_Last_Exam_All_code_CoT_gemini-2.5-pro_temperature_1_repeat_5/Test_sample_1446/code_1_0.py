# This script solves a riddle embedded in the question.
# The plan is to extract numbers and an operation from the text.

# The first number is found in the term "Gâ‚„".
base = 4

# The second number is derived from the Roman numeral 'V' in the word "vicinity".
exponent = 5

# The operation is exponentiation, as hinted by the phrase "critical exponent".
result = base ** exponent

# The final equation is constructed and printed.
# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
print(f"Based on the clues in the text, the equation is {base} to the power of {exponent}, which is calculated as:")
print(f"{base} ** {exponent} = {result}")
