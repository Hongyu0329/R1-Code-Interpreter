def solve_lebesgue_integrability():
    """
    This function determines which of the given function types are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.

    A function f is Lebesgue integrable if:
    1. f is a measurable function.
    2. The integral of its absolute value is finite (∫|f|dμ < ∞).

    Analysis of options:
    F. A continuous function on [a,b]: This is correct. A continuous function on a compact set is bounded and measurable. A bounded measurable function on a set of finite measure ([a,b]) is integrable.
    L. A measurable function whose absolute value is integrable: This is correct by the definition of Lebesgue integrability.
    M. A bounded continuous function on (a,b): This is correct. It is a bounded measurable function on a set of finite measure ((a,b)), which implies it is integrable.
    
    All other options fail for reasons like potential non-measurability (A, G, H, I), infinite domain measure (B, C, D), or being unbounded in a way that makes the integral infinite (E, J, K).
