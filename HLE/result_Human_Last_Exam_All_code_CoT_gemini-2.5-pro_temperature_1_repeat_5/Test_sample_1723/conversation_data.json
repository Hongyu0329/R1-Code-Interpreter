    "Of course, I can help with that. The question asks for the name of a specific mushroom genus. This is a knowledge-based question. I will create a simple Python script to provide the answer.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will store the name of the mushroom genus in a string variable.\n2.  I will then use the `print()` function to display the answer in a clear and complete sentence.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking for the name of the single genus of mushroom\n# known to produce a distinctly blue spore print.\n# This script will store the answer in a variable and print it.\n\n# Define the variable holding the name of the genus.\ngenus_name = \"Entoloma\"\n\n# Print the answer for the user.\nprint(f\"The single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print is: {genus_name}\")\n```\n<<<Entoloma>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    There is a single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print, what is its name?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
