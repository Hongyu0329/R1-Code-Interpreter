    "The value you are referring to is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. This is the fundamental measurement from which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is calculated. The most common term for this is the **R-R interval**, named after the R-peak in an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform. When derived from PPG as in your case, it can also be called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)**.\n\nHere is a simple python script to output the answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_value_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains the value used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n  \"\"\"\n  # HRV is computed from the variation in the time between consecutive heartbeats.\n  value_name = \"R-R interval\"\n  alternative_name = \"inter-beat interval (IBI)\"\n  \n  print(f\"The value computed between heartbeats for HRV is the time duration between them.\")\n  print(f\"This is most commonly called the '{value_name}' or '{alternative_name}'.\")\n\nget_hrv_value_name()\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
