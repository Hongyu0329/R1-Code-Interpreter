The asymptotic expansion of the generating function H(s, s') for a planar Birkhoff billiard is:

H(s, s') ≈ |s' - s| - (1/24)*κ(s)**2*|s' - s|**3

Where:
  s, s' are the arc-length parameters of consecutive boundary collisions.
  κ(s) is the curvature of the boundary at point s.
  This approximation holds in the limit |s' - s| → 0.
