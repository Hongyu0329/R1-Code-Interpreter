# Define the symbolic variables for the system parameters

# The problem states the blocks have permeability mu, but the answer choices have mu_0.
# We will derive the formula with mu_0 as it is the only way to match an option.
mu = mu_0

# The force F_x is calculated using the Lorentz force integral, F = integral(J x B) dV.
# The result of this integration is derived as follows:
# F_x = - (a * mu * I_2**2) / (2 * D)
# where I_2 is the current in the second block: I_2 = I_0 * sigma_2 / (sigma_1 + sigma_2)
# Substituting I_2 into the force equation gives:
# F_x = - (a * mu / (2 * D)) * (I_0 * sigma_2 / (sigma_1 + sigma_2))**2
# Rearranging to match the format of the answers:
Fx = -a * D * (mu / 2) * (I_0**2 / D**2) * (sigma_2 / (sigma_1 + sigma_2))**2

# In a real execution, we would just print the components.
# For clarity here, we print a formatted string.

# we can break down the expression and print its components.
