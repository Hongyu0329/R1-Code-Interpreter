    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** First, I will clarify what the \"sum of three cycles\" means in graph theory. It refers to the graph join operation, denoted by '+'. The graph \\( G \\) is thus \\( C_n + C_n + C_n \\).\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Join:** I will use the property of the chromatic number for a graph join: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This extends to three graphs, so \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle:** The problem now reduces to finding \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). I'll analyze the two cases for the cycle length \\( n \\) (assuming \\( n \\ge 3 \\)):\n    *   **Case 1: \\( n \\) is even.** An even cycle is bipartite, so its chromatic number is 2.\n    *   **Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd.** An odd cycle is not bipartite and requires 3 colors.\n4.  **Calculate \\( \\chi(G) \\) for both cases:**\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even, \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd, \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n5.  **Determine the Maximum:** The question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number. By comparing the results from the two cases, the maximum value is 9.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that carries out this logic. The script will print the explanation for each step, calculate the results for both even and odd \\( n \\), and then identify and print the maximal value along with the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G which is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Let G be a graph that is the sum (or join) of three cycles of length n, denoted as G = C_n + C_n + C_n.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a graph join H_1 + H_2 is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers: chi(H_1 + H_2) = chi(H_1) + chi(H_2).\")\n    print(\"This means that the set of colors used for each subgraph must be disjoint.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the chromatic number of G is chi(G) = chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) = 3 * chi(C_n).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a cycle graph, chi(C_n), depends on the parity of n (assuming n >= 3).\")\n\n    # Case 1: n is even\n    chi_cn_even = 2\n    print(f\"\\nCase 1: n is even (n = 4, 6, ...)\")\n    print(f\"A cycle of even length is bipartite, so its chromatic number is {chi_cn_even}.\")\n    chi_g_even = 3 * chi_cn_even\n    print(f\"In this case, chi(G) = 3 * chi(C_n) = 3 * {chi_cn_even} = {chi_g_even}.\")\n\n    # Case 2: n is odd\n    chi_cn_odd = 3\n    print(f\"\\nCase 2: n is odd (n = 3, 5, ...)\")\n    print(f\"A cycle of odd length is not bipartite and requires {chi_cn_odd} colors.\")\n    chi_g_odd = 3 * chi_cn_odd\n    print(f\"In this case, chi(G) = 3 * chi(C_n) = 3 * {chi_cn_odd} = {chi_g_odd}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Determine the maximal chromatic number\n    maximal_chi = max(chi_g_even, chi_g_odd)\n    print(\"\\nTo find the maximal chromatic number, we compare the results from the two cases.\")\n    print(f\"The possible chromatic numbers for G are {chi_g_even} (for even n) and {chi_g_odd} (for odd n).\")\n    print(f\"The maximum of these two values is {maximal_chi}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the maximal chromatic number, which occurs when n is odd, is:\")\n    print(f\"Maximal chi(G) = {3} * {chi_cn_odd} = {maximal_chi}\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_number()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
