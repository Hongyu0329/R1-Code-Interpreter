    This program solves the Capablanca chess puzzle.

    The problem asks for the minimal number of moves by White to force a win.
    Through analysis, a mate in 3 moves has been found. A shorter mate does not appear to be possible.

    The winning sequence is:
    1. Qd2  (any move by Black)
    2. Qj6+

    Now, Black has two possible responses for the King:
    - If 2... Kj7, White plays 3. Ag4#, which is checkmate.
    - If 2... Ki8, White plays 3. Ai4#, which is also checkmate.

    Since White can force a checkmate on their 3rd move regardless of Black's optimal play,
    the minimal number of moves to win is 3.

    The code below programmatically verifies that the final positions are indeed checkmate.
