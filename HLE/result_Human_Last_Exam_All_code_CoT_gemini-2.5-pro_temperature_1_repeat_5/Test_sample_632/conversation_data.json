    "The task is to identify a unique architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" that was removed. The question specifies it was removed in 1950. My research indicates that the most famous and unique architectural feature removed from the Pantheon itself (which dominates the piazza) was a pair of bell towers. However, historical records show they were removed in 1883, not 1950. Given that these towers are the most notorious \"removed feature\" associated with the Pantheon, it is highly likely they are the subject of the question, despite the discrepancy in the date.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that will print a detailed explanation of this feature, including its nickname and the correct date of its removal, while also acknowledging the date mentioned in the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pantheon_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the architectural feature removed from the Pantheon\n    in the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    feature_name = \"a pair of bell towers\"\n    nickname = \"'le orecchie d'asino' or 'the donkey's ears'\"\n    architect = \"Bernini (or his school)\"\n    year_added = \"17th century\"\n    year_removed_actual = 1883\n    year_removed_question = 1950\n\n    print(f\"The unique architectural feature in the Piazza della Rotonda was {feature_name}.\")\n    print(f\"They were added in the {year_added}, likely by the architect {architect}.\")\n    print(f\"The Romans gave them the derogatory nickname {nickname} because they were considered ugly and out of place on the ancient temple.\")\n    print(\"\\nIMPORTANT NOTE ON THE DATE:\")\n    print(f\"While the question states the removal year was {year_removed_question}, these widely disliked towers were actually removed much earlier.\")\n    # The final part of the prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # Since there's no calculation, I will simply print the key year.\n    print(f\"The correct year of their removal by the city administration was: {year_removed_actual}\")\n\nsolve_pantheon_mystery()\n```\n<<<The twin bell towers known as \"the donkey's ears\">>>"
