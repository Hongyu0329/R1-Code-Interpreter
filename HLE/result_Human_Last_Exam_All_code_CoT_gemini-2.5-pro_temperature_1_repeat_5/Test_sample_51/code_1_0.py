    # Premise 1: A dependent type theory with structural recursion.
    # Termination is guaranteed by a subterm relation.

    # Premise 2: A non-standard subterm relation is defined.
    # The crucial part of this relation is: any lambda abstraction `(λ x. f)`
    # is considered a subterm of any term `X`.

    # Consequence 1: This subterm rule is not well-founded. It can be used to
    # justify a non-terminating recursive definition if recursion on function types
    # is permitted. For example:
    # `rec(g : FunctionType) := rec(λ x. some_new_function_body)`
    # The termination checker would see the recursive call is on a lambda, and
    # by the given rule, consider it a valid "smaller" term, even though it creates a loop.
    # Such a non-terminating function leads to logical inconsistency.

    # Premise 3: Structural recursion is, by definition, restricted to
    # inductively defined types (e.g., Nat, List). It does not apply to
    # function types.

    # Consequence 2: The system only becomes inconsistent if one of the axioms
    # allows us to bridge this gap and perform structural recursion on a function type.
    # This can be achieved if an axiom allows proving that an inductive type `I`
    # is equivalent or isomorphic to a function type `F`. If so, the recursion
    # principle from `I` can be applied to `F`.

    # Analysis of Axioms: We need to find the axiom that can establish an
    # isomorphism between an inductive type and a function type.

    # - Functional Extensionality, Propositional Extensionality, etc., are generally
    #   considered consistent and do not create such isomorphisms.
    # - Classical axioms like Excluded Middle can cause other issues but are not
    #   directly related to this specific structural paradox.
    # - Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) is a powerful axiom known to have
    #   deep structural implications. Research in type theory (e.g., Hurkens'
    #   paradox) demonstrates that UIP can be used to construct an inductive type `I`
    #   and prove that it is isomorphic to a function type (e.g., `I -> Bool`).

    # Conclusion: The inconsistency is enabled by UIP. The chain of events is:
    # 1. UIP is assumed.
    # 2. UIP allows the construction of an inductive type `I` isomorphic to a function type `F`.
    # 3. The structural recursion principle of `I` is transported to `F`.
    # 4. A non-terminating function on `F` is defined using the faulty subterm rule.
    # 5. This makes the entire system inconsistent.

    # The inconsistent axiom is Uniqueness of Identity Proofs.
