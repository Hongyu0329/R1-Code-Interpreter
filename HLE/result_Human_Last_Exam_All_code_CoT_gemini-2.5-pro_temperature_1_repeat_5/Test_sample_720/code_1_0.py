    This function explains and prints the minimum achievable curvature cost for the NGD update.

    The cost is derived for a single-layer fully connected network of size [d x d]
    trained on n samples, where n < d.

    The reasoning for the minimum cost is based on exploiting the low-rank and
    Kronecker product structure of the Fisher Information Matrix (F), which allows
    the expensive inversion of a d^2 x d^2 matrix to be replaced by a series of
    much cheaper operations.
