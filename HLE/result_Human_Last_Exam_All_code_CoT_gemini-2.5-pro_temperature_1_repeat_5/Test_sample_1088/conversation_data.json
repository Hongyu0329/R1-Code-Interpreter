    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atoms involved in a calculation. I will explain how to calculate this number for any given atom and then provide a Python script to automate the calculation for any chemical formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name:** I'll break down the `6-311G**` notation to understand what each part means in terms of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n2.  **Calculate for Individual Atoms:** I'll show how to apply these rules to a hydrogen atom and a \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atom, using Carbon as an example.\n3.  **Combine for a Molecule:** Using methane (CH₄) as an example, I'll demonstrate how to sum the PGFs for all atoms in a molecule.\n4.  **Provide a Python Script:** I'll write a Python script that takes a chemical formula (like \"CH4\" or \"H2O\") and automatically calculates the total number of primitive Gaussians, showing the breakdown for each atom.\n\n### **1. Understanding the 6-311G** Notation**\n\nThis is a Pople-style basis set, and the name tells you exactly how it's constructed:\n\n*   **`6-`**: Each **core** atomic orbital on a heavy atom is described by a single function that is a combination (a contraction) of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **`-311G`**: Each **valence** atomic orbital is \"split\" into three functions.\n    *   The first function is a contraction of **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second function is a single **1** PGF.\n    *   The third function is a single **1** PGF.\n    *   So, each valence orbital is described by a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n*   **`**` (double star): These are polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonding.\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of **d-type** polarization functions to each **heavy atom**. A set of d-functions consists of **6** PGFs (in their Cartesian form: d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   The second `*` adds one set of **p-type** polarization functions to each **hydrogen atom**. A set of p-functions consists of **3** PGFs (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n\n### **2. Calculation for Methane (CH₄)**\n\nLet's apply these rules to the atoms in methane.\n\n**For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is a valence orbital.\n*   Valence PGFs (from `-311G`): 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n*   Polarization PGFs (from the second `*`): 3 (one set of p-functions)\n*   **Total for one H atom = 5 + 3 = 8 PGFs**\n\n**For the Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   Carbon is a heavy atom. Its electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   Core PGFs (from `6-`): It has one core orbital (1s). So, 1 orbital × 6 PGFs = 6\n*   Valence PGFs (from `-311G`): It has four valence orbitals (2s, 2pₓ, 2pᵧ, 2p₂). So, 4 orbitals × (3 + 1 + 1) PGFs/orbital = 4 × 5 = 20\n*   Polarization PGFs (from the first `*`): 6 (one set of d-functions)\n*   **Total for one C atom = 6 + 20 + 6 = 32 PGFs**\n\n**Total for CH₄ molecule:**\n*   Total = (Primitives for C) + 4 × (Primitives for H)\n*   Total = 32 + 4 × 8 = 32 + 32 = **64 PGFs**\n\n### **3. Python Script for General Calculation**\n\nThe following Python script automates this process for any chemical formula composed of common main-group elements.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_primitives_for_formula(formula: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G**\n    basis set for a given chemical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Calculating primitive Gaussians for '{formula}' with the 6-311G** basis set.\\n\")\n\n    # Data for atoms: number of core and valence atomic orbitals (AOs).\n    # This data covers common main-group elements.\n    # - Period 1: H\n    # - Period 2: C, N, O (Core: 1s -> 1 AO; Valence: 2s, 2p -> 4 AOs)\n    # - Period 3: S (Core: 1s, 2s, 2p -> 5 AOs; Valence: 3s, 3p -> 4 AOs)\n    ATOMIC_DATA = {\n        'H': {'name': 'Hydrogen', 'core_ao': 0, 'valence_ao': 1},\n        'C': {'name': 'Carbon', 'core_ao': 1, 'valence_ao': 4},\n        'N': {'name': 'Nitrogen', 'core_ao': 1, 'valence_ao': 4},\n        'O': {'name': 'Oxygen', 'core_ao': 1, 'valence_ao': 4},\n        'S': {'name': 'Sulfur', 'core_ao': 5, 'valence_ao': 4},\n    }\n\n    # This regex parses chemical formulas like \"H2O\" or \"CH4\"\n    pattern = re.compile(r'([A-Z][a-z]?)(\\d*)')\n    matches = pattern.findall(formula)\n    \n    atom_counts = {}\n    for symbol, count_str in matches:\n        if symbol not in ATOMIC_DATA:\n            print(f\"Warning: Data for atom '{symbol}' is not available.
