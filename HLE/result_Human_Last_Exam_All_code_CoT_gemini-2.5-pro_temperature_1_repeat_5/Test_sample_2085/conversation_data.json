    "This is a linguistic and historical question. The name \"Odobeccus\" is not actually Gaulish, but rather the Latinized form of a Frankish (Germanic) name. To find its modern French equivalent, we need to trace its etymological roots. I will use a Python script to simulate looking up this name in a small database of historical name correspondences.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Create a Python dictionary to act as a small database, mapping historical names to their modern French equivalents.\n2.  Store the name \"Odobeccus\" and its corresponding French name, \"Eudes\", in the dictionary.\n3.  Retrieve the French name from the dictionary using the Gaulish name as the key.\n4.  Print the result in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_french_equivalent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the modern French equivalent of a historical name by looking it up\n    in a predefined dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This dictionary simulates a database of historical name equivalents.\n    # Odobeccus is the Latinized form of a Frankish name.\n    historical_name_map = {\n        \"Odobeccus\": \"Eudes\"\n    }\n\n    gaulish_name = \"Odobeccus\"\n\n    # Retrieve the modern French name from the map.\n    french_name = historical_name_map.get(gaulish_name, \"Unknown\")\n\n    if french_name != \"Unknown\":\n        print(f\"The French equivalent of the name '{gaulish_name}' is '{french_name}'.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Could not find a French equivalent for '{gaulish_name}'.\")\n\nfind_french_equivalent()\n```\n<<<Eudes>>>"
