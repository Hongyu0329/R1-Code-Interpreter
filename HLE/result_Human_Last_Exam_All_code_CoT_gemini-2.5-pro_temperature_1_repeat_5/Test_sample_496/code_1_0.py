def solve_cohomology_rank():
    """
    Calculates the total rank of the SO(4)-equivariant cohomology ring of the complement of X.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. The total rank is given by the sum of equivariant Betti numbers of X, sum(b_j for j=0 to 6).
    2. We determine the equivariant Betti numbers b_j = rank(H_SO(4)^j(X)).
    3. Based on the structure of X and properties of equivariant cohomology:
       - The fixed point set X^SO(4) is empty, so the equivariant Euler characteristic is 0.
         This means sum_{j even} b_j = sum_{j odd} b_j.
       - The low degree Betti numbers are b_0=1, b_1=1, b_2=1.
    4. The simplest solution satisfying these conditions is b_3=1 and b_j=0 for j>=4.
    5. This gives the sequence of Betti numbers b = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].
    6. The total rank is the sum of these numbers.
