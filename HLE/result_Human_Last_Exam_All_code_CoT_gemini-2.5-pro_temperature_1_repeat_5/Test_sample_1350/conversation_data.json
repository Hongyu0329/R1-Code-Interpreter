    "My plan is to answer the user's question about William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*. The question asks to identify a character who describes a scene recognizable as the Romulus and Remus myth. I will identify this character and the context of their description. As per the instructions, I will provide the answer in the form of a Python script that prints the information.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the literary question about\n    William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\".\n    \"\"\"\n    character_name = \"The Wood-Sun\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"In William Morris's 'The House of the Wolfings', the character who \"\n        \"describes visiting a Roman area and seeing their religious practices \"\n        \"is The Wood-Sun.\\n\\n\"\n        \"She recounts a vision or a past journey where she saw the Romans' city. \"\n        \"There, she witnessed a depiction of a 'she-wolf' suckling 'two man-babes'. \"\n        \"While she doesn't know the names, this is a clear and unmistakable reference \"\n        \"to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being nursed by the Capitoline Wolf.\"\n    )\n    print(explanation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_character()\n```\n<<<The Wood-Sun>>>"
