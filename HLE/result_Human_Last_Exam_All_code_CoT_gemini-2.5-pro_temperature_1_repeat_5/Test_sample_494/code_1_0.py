    explanation = """Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-zero hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling.

Here is the reasoning:

1.  **Physical Basis of Tunneling:** The tunneling phenomenon in ammonia (NH3), known as inversion, arises from its pyramidal geometry. The nitrogen atom can be on one side of the plane of the three hydrogen atoms or on the other. These two configurations are separated by a potential energy barrier, creating what is known as a 'double-well potential'. Quantum tunneling allows the nitrogen atom to pass through this barrier even without having enough energy to go over it.

2.  **Unaltered Potential and Mass:** The rate of this tunneling is determined by the height and width of the energy barrier and the masses of the atoms involved. The exotic hydrogen is defined as differing from ordinary hydrogen *only* in its nuclear spin (0 instead of 1/2). Its mass and charge are the same. Therefore, the electrostatic forces that create the potential energy surface, and the atomic masses that determine the system's kinetics, are identical to those in a normal ammonia molecule. The fundamental physical conditions for tunneling are unchanged.

3.  **The Role of Nuclear Spin and the Pauli Principle:** The change in nuclear spin affects the symmetry requirements of the total molecular wavefunction, as dictated by the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
    *   **Ordinary Hydrogen (Fermions):** With nuclear spin 1/2, ordinary hydrogens are fermions. The total wavefunction must be *antisymmetric* when any two identical hydrogens are exchanged.
    *   **Exotic Hydrogen (Bosons):** With nuclear spin 0, the exotic hydrogens are bosons. The total wavefunction must be *symmetric* when any two identical hydrogens are exchanged.

4.  **Conclusion:** This symmetry principle acts as a selection rule, determining which combinations of vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin states are allowed to exist. The tunneling itself creates a pair of vibrational states: a lower-energy symmetric state and a higher-energy antisymmetric state. For both ordinary (fermionic) and exotic (bosonic) ammonia, there are allowed rotational states that can be combined with *both* of these vibrational states to satisfy the overall symmetry requirements.

In summary, changing the nuclear spin from fermion to boson changes the selection rules for rotational levels but does not eliminate the double-well potential or the tunneling phenomenon itself. The energy splitting between the two states, which is the signature of tunneling, would still be present.
