    "This problem requires us to find the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas. We can solve this using the principles of statistical mechanics, specifically by maximizing the entropy for a Bose gas under the constraint of a fixed total energy. This maximization principle is the cornerstone of statistical mechanics and is conceptually formalized by large deviation theorems like the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, which states that the probability of observing a macroscopic state far from equilibrium is exponentially small. The equilibrium state is the most probable state, the one with the highest number of microscopic configurations, and thus the highest entropy.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Start with the expression for the number of microstates (and thus entropy) for a system of bosons (photons).\n2.  Maximize this entropy with respect to the number of photons at each energy level, subject to the constraint that the total energy is constant. For photons, the number of particles is not conserved, which means their chemical potential is zero. This simplifies the maximization problem.\n3.  The result of this maximization is the Bose-Einstein distribution function, which gives the average number of photons occupying each energy state at equilibrium.\n4.  To find the total energy and entropy, we need to sum over all possible energy states. For a continuous spectrum of energies, as in a photon gas in a 3D box, this sum becomes an integral. We will use the density of states `g(e)` for photons.\n5.  By performing these integrations, we will arrive at the final formulas for the equilibrium mean energy (E) and entropy (S) as a function of temperature (T), volume (V), and fundamental physical constants.\n\nThe following Python script will print out these steps and the final resulting equations.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bose_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    for a Bose gas of light quanta (photons) using principles from\n    statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Plan ###\")\n    print(\"This script outlines the derivation of the equilibrium mean energy (E) and entropy (S) for a photon gas.\")\n    print(\"The method is based on the principles of statistical mechanics, which find the most probable macroscopic state by maximizing entropy.\")\n    print(\"\\nSteps:\")\n    print(\"1.
