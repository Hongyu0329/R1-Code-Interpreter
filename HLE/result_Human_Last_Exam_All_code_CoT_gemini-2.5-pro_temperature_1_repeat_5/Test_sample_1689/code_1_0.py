1. The patient's history and physical exam strongly suggest allergic contact dermatitis. The key finding is the distribution of the rash on the posterior axillary folds, sparing the vault, which is characteristic of textile (clothing) dermatitis rather than deodorant dermatitis.
2. The onset of the rash correlates with the patient starting a new workout program, which involves wearing specific workout clothes that cause friction and perspiration, potentially leaching allergens like dyes or resins.
3. Let's evaluate the options:
   - A. Skin biopsy is an invasive procedure and not the first-line diagnostic tool for suspected allergic contact dermatitis.
   - B. A KOH preparation is used to diagnose fungal infections, which is less likely to be the primary cause given the clinical picture.
   - C. A topical steroid is a form of treatment, not a diagnostic step.
   - D. A patch test is the gold standard for identifying the specific causative agent in allergic contact dermatitis. It is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the allergen.
4. The case study itself validates this choice by stating that patch testing was indeed performed and yielded a positive result for resins used in textiles.
