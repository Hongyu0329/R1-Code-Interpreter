# Choice A
print("\nChoice A: 'Computers comp few urns'")
print("Analysis: Does not repeat the 'com-pu-ter' syllable pattern and its meaning is unrelated to the description.")

# Choice B
print("\nChoice B: 'Computer: \"Come poo, tern!\"'")
print("Syllable Analysis: 'com-pu-ter' is phonetically repeated by 'Come poo, tern'.")
print("  - 'com' sounds like 'Come'")
print("  - 'pu' sounds like 'poo'")
print("  - 'ter' sounds like 'tern' (a type of bird)")
print("Description Analysis: This perfectly matches the prompt. The 'computer' (the software) is telling a 'tern' (a bird) to 'Come poo' (relieve itself).")
print("Result: This is a valid True Avalanche that fits the description perfectly.")

# Choice C
print("\nChoice C: 'Computer: \"Come, pee you turkey!\"'")
print("Analysis: The syllable pattern 'come-pee-you-turkey' is not a repetition of 'com-pu-ter'.")

# Choice D
print("\nChoice D: 'Comb pewter computer'")
print("Analysis: This is a structurally correct avalanche ('comb-pew-ter' repeats 'com-pu-ter'). However, its meaning ('to search through metal items') does not match the description about birds.")

# Choice E
print("\nChoice E: 'Computer needs bird relieves'")
print("Analysis: This is not an avalanche. It lacks the necessary syllable repetition and punny nature.")

print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
print("Choice B is the only option that is both a valid True Avalanche and a creative pun that matches the given description.")

print("Final Answer: The correct choice is B because 'Computer' establishes the syllable pattern, and 'Come poo, tern!' repeats it while perfectly matching the description.")
