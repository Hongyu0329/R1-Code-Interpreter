    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will analyze its phase plane. A separatrix is a curve that divides the phase plane into regions of qualitatively different behavior. Often, the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points act as separatrices.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Find the equilibrium points (fixed points) of the system where the derivatives are zero.\n2.  Analyze the stability of these points by linearizing the system (using the Jacobian matrix) to classify them.\n3.  Identify any saddle points. The manifolds of a saddle point are the key separatrices.\n4.  Find the equation of the unstable or stable manifold corresponding to the saddle point.\n\n**Step 1: Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe system is:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$\n$u' = u^2(u-1)$\n\nWe set $d'=0$ and $u'=0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$ gives:\n    $2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$ gives:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives two equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n**Step 2: Stability Analysis**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$ of the system:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n*   At **(-1, 1)**:\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10(1))(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point.**\n\n*   At **(0, 1)**:\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10(1))(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Both are positive, so **(0, 1) is an unstable node (source).**\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Finding the Separatrix Equation**\n\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1) are the separatrices for the system. Let's find an equation for one of these manifolds. We look for a trajectory of the system that passes through (-1, 1). We can analyze the differential equation for the trajectories in the phase plane:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\n\nInstead of solving this complex equation directly, we can test for a simple polynomial solution of the form $d=f(u)$. Let's test the hypothesis that $d = -u^2$ is a solution.\nIf $d = -u^2$, then $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\n\nSubstitute $d=-u^2$ and $\\frac{dd}{du}=-2u$ into the phase plane equation:\n*   Left-hand side (LHS): $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$\n*   Right-hand side (RHS):\n    $\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4}{u^3 - u^2}$\n    $= \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^3 - u^2} = \\frac{-2u^2(u^2 - u)}{u(u^2-u)}$  No, let's factor differently.\n    $= \\frac{-2u^3(u - 1)}{u^2(u - 1)} = -2u$\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the equation $d = -u^2$ describes a trajectory of the system.\nLet's check if this curve passes through the saddle point (-1, 1). If $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. Yes, it passes through (-1, 1).\n\nA trajectory that connects to a saddle point must be one of its manifolds. To confirm it's a separatrix, we can check its slope at the saddle point against the direction of the eigenvectors. The slope of the curve $d=-u^2$ at $u=1$ is $\\frac{dd}{du}|_{u=1} = -2(1) = -2$.\nThe eigenvector for the unstable manifold (eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$) of $J(-1,1)$ has a direction vector $(v_d, v_u) = (-2, 1)$, giving a slope of $v_d/v_u = -2/1 = -2$.\nSince the slopes match, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1) and is therefore the separatrix.\n\nThe following Python code will print the equation for this separatrix.\n\n```python\n# The analysis of the system of differential equations reveals that a key separatrix\n# is the unstable manifold of the saddle point at (d, u) = (-1, 1).\n# We have found an analytical equation for this curve.\n\n# The equation is of the form: d = a * u^p\n# Let's define the numerical values for the parameters 'a' and 'p'.\n\n# The coefficient of the u term\na = -1\n# The exponent of the u term\np = 2\n\n# Now, we print the final equation for the separatrix.\n# The numbers that form the equation are explicitly printed as requested.\nprint(\"The equation of the separatrix is:\")\nprint(f\"d = {a} * u^{p}\")\n```\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
