    # The final equation is constructed from several physical principles:
    # 1. The force is derived using the energy gradient method (F = I1*I2*dM/dg),
    #    which correctly yields the g^2 term in the denominator.
    # 2. The permeability is adjusted for temperature effects, introducing the (1 - alpha_T*(T-T0)) term.
    # 3. The permeability is adjusted for magnetic saturation, introducing the (1 + B/Bs) term in the denominator.
    
    # The components of the equation are:
    # -2: The number representing the attractive force direction and geometric factors.
    # pi: The mathematical constant pi.
    # R: Radius of the outer coil.
    # N: Turns in the second coil.
    # N_0: Turns in the first coil.
    # I_0: DC current in the first coil.
    # i_0: Amplitude of the AC current in the second coil.
    # omega: Angular frequency of the AC current.
    # t: time.
    # g: Radial gap size.
    # mu_0: Permeability of free space.
    # B_s: Saturation flux density.
    # alpha_T: Temperature coefficient of permeability.
    # T: Operating temperature.
    # T_0: Reference temperature.

    # The chosen formula from the options is B.
    # Note: As derived in the thinking steps, the term '2*pi*R' should dimensionally be an area 'A',
    # suggesting a typo in the problem's options. We proceed with the provided option.
