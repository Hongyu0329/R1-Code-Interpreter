    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the sequence:** The problem asks for the value of `a(n)` for `n=3`. The function `a(n)` represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for the electron or photon propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). In QED, the order `2n` corresponds to the number of vertices in the diagrams, which is also equivalent to the number of `n` loops.\n2.  **Find the sequence values:** This is a known integer sequence in physics. I will look up the established values for this sequence. The first few terms are:\n    *   `a(1)` (1-loop, order 2): 1 diagram\n    *   `a(2)` (2-loops, order 4): 2 diagrams\n    *   `a(3)` (3-loops, order 6): 10 diagrams\n    *   `a(4)` (4-loops, order 8): 74 diagrams\n    This sequence is cataloged as A002888 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n3.  **Formulate the code:** The task is to find `a(3)`. I will write a Python script that stores these known values and retrieves the value for `n=3`. The script will then print the final result in the format of an equation, `a(3) = 10`, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_qed_propagator_diagrams(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n\n    for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED).\n    \n    The order 2n corresponds to n loops in the diagram.
