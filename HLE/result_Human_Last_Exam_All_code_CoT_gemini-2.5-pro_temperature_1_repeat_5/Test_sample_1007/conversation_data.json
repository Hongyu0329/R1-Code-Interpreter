    "To determine which ballet step has the same ending leg position as its starting position, I will analyze each option:\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:** An *entrechat* is a jump where the legs beat in the air. The number indicates the number of movements. An *entrechat six* (three beats) starts from fifth position and lands back in the *exact same* fifth position. The feet do not change.\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:** *Échappé* means to escape. The legs jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second) and back to fifth. The word *changé* explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the foot that was in front at the start is now in the back at the end.\n3.  **C. Assemblé:** *Assemblé* means assembled. The dancer brushes one foot out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (*assembles*) the legs together in the air to land in fifth position. A standard *assemblé* (like *dessus* or *dessous*) changes which foot is in front.\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:** *Glissade* is a glide. In a *glissade derrière* (gliding backward/behind), the dancer starts in fifth, glides the back foot out, and closes the front foot to the *back* of the other foot, changing the position.\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative jump similar to a *pas de chat* with added circles of the legs (*ronds de jambe*). It involves changing feet, so the ending position is different from the starting one.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only step that returns the dancer to the identical starting position is the **Entrechat six**.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same position it starts.\n    We represent the starting position as '5th Position (Foot A Front)'\n    and a changed position as '5th Position (Foot B Front)'.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps = {\n        'A.
