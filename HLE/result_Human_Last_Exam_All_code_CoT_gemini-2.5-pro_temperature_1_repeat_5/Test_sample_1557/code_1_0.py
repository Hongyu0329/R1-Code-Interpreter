# The final answer is a list of the numbers of the correct statements, sorted and separated by a comma.
# The correct statements are 1, 6, and 8.

# Here is the reasoning for each correct statement:

# 1: This statement is correct. Wellington's logistical genius in the Peninsular War was famously built upon the lessons he learned managing vast, mobile supply trains in India. He transformed the British commissariat from a weakness into a decisive strength, and while the exact "40%" figure is a specific detail, the massive and documented improvement in efficiency is a well-established historical fact. His Indian experience was foundational to this success.

# 6: This statement is correct. In India, Wellington commanded a diverse army of British soldiers, East India Company sepoys, and allied local forces. His ability to successfully integrate these different troops became a blueprint for later British colonial expansion. The empire relied heavily on raising local auxiliary forces in its campaigns across Africa and Asia in the subsequent decades, making this a standard and essential practice.

# 8: This statement is correct. The "flying column" - a fast-moving, self-sufficient, combined-arms force - was a tactic Wellington perfected in the wide-open spaces of India to pursue mobile Maratha armies. He adapted this concept for use in the Peninsular War (e.g., with his famous Light Division) and the tactic was subsequently employed in other colonial conflicts, such as the challenging jungle warfare of the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824-1826).

# Combine the numbers of the correct statements into the final format.
correct_options = [1, 6, 8]
