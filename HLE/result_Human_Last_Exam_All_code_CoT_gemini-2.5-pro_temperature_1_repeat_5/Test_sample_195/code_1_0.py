# This script determines the least dangerous path from the adventurer '@' to the gold 'g'.

# 1. Analysis of the map and legend.
# The adventurer '@' starts in a large, unlit hallway ('#').
# The goal 'g' is in a lit room accessible via a door ('+').
# A major threat, the Dragon 'D', is located in a separate room that should be avoided.
# A safe, lit room containing a magic potion ('!') and a scroll ('?') is located just below the adventurer's starting position.

# 2. Identification of logical paths.
# Path 'L': A direct route moving Left from the start to the goal's room.
# - Pro: Shortest path, minimizing time in the unlit hallway.
# - Con: Forgoes the chance to acquire helpful items.

# Path 'DUL': A strategic detour.
# - D (Down): Move down to the door of the potion/scroll room.
# - U (Up): After getting the items, return to the hallway.
# - L (Left): Proceed along the hallway to the goal's room.
# - Pro: Acquires powerful items that mitigate danger, making the overall journey safer.
# - Con: Slightly longer than the direct route.

# 3. Defining "Least Dangerous".
# "Least dangerous" implies a risk-averse strategy. The primary goal is to maximize safety.
# While the 'L' path is faster, the 'DUL' path actively reduces risk by equipping the adventurer
# with powerful, unknown magical items found in a safe location. The small increase in travel
# time is a worthwhile trade-off for a significant boost in safety.

# 4. Conclusion.
# The most prudent and therefore "least dangerous" course of action is to secure the helpful items before
# proceeding to the goal.
