def solve_cardinal_problem():
    """
    This function determines the second smallest possible cardinal for a given tower definition.

    The problem describes a tower of subsets of ω_2. The length of the shortest
    such tower is a cardinal characteristic known as the tower number, generalized
    for κ = ω_2, denoted t(ω_2).

    1.  The properties of t(κ) dictate that it must be a regular cardinal
        and that t(κ) > cf(κ).
    2.  For κ = ω_2, which is regular, cf(ω_2) = ω_2. Thus, the length δ = t(ω_2)
        must be a regular cardinal greater than ω_2.
    3.  The sequence of cardinals greater than ω_2 begins ω_3, ω_4, ω_5, ...
    4.  All successor cardinals (like ω_3, ω_4, ω_5) are regular.
    5.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for δ is the first regular cardinal
        after ω_2, which is ω_3.
    6.  The second smallest possible value for δ is the next regular cardinal,
        which is ω_4.

    The code below will print this result.
