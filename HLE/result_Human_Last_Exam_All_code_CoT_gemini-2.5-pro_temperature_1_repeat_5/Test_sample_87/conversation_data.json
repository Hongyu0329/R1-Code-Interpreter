    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will use the given values and the chain rule of mutual information to calculate all the basic mutual information quantities between $X, Y, Z$, such as $I(X;Z)$ and the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$.\n2.  Next, I will find a general expression for the target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$, in terms of the given values and quantities related to $W$. The most useful identity for this is $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n3.  The problem then reduces to finding the maximum possible value of the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. This term is the negative of the interaction information $I(X;Y;W)$.\n4.  I will analyze the sign of the interaction information. The fact that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ ($W=g(Z)$) imposes a critical constraint. Since the initial interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$ is positive (meaning $Y$ and $Z$ are redundant sources of information about $X$), any processing on $Z$ (like the function $g$) cannot create synergy. This implies that $I(X;Y;W)$ must be non-negative.\n5.  This non-negativity constraint ($I(X;Y;W) \\ge 0$) provides an upper bound for $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. Specifically, $I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y) \\ge 0$, which means $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) \\le 0$.\n6.  Using this bound, I will find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n7.  Finally, I will show that this maximum value is achievable by constructing a hypothetical $W$ that isolates the \"unique\" information that $Z$ has about $X$ with respect to $Y$. I will calculate the value of $I(X;Y|W)$ for this specific $W$ to confirm it matches the maximum bound.\n\nNow, I will execute this plan using Python code to formalize the steps and calculate the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_information_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) based on the given information.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    I_X_Y = 3  # I(X;Y)\n    I_X_Y_given_Z = 2  # I(X;Y|Z)\n    I_X_Z_given_Y = 5  # I(X;Z|Y)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate related mutual information quantities.\")\n    # Using the chain rule for mutual information: I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)\n    # We can write: I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\n    # Let's solve for I(X;Z)\n    # I(X;Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;Y|Z)\n    I_X_Z = I_X_Y + I_X_Z_given_Y - I_X_Y_given_Z\n    print(f\"From the chain rule, I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\")\n    print(f\"{I_X_Y} + {I_X_Z_given_Y} = I(X;Z) + {I_X_Y_given_Z}\")\n    print(f\"So, I(X;Z) = {I_X_Y} + {I_X_Z_given_Y} - {I_X_Y_given_Z} = {I_X_Z}\")\n\n    # The interaction information I(X;Y;Z) measures the redundancy or synergy between Y and Z about X.\n    # I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z)\n    I_X_Y_Z = I_X_Y - I_X_Y_given_Z\n    print(f\"\\nThe interaction information is I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = {I_X_Y} - {I_X_Y_given_Z} = {I_X_Y_Z}\")\n    # Let's check for consistency: I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y)\n    print(f\"Check: I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = {I_X_Z} - {I_X_Z_given_Y} = {I_X_Z - I_X_Z_given_Y}.
