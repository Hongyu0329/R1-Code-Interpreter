    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle in a specific region inside a 1D box.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Recall the Physics:** The probability `P` of finding a particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψ_n(x)|²`, over that interval.\n    *   `P = ∫[x1, x2] |ψ_n(x)|² dx`\n2.  **State the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is:\n    *   `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n*π*x/a)`\n3.  **Define the Probability Density:** The probability density for our specific case (`n=2`) is:\n    *   `|ψ_2(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2*π*x/a)`\n4.  **Set up the Integral:** We need to calculate the definite integral:\n    *   `P = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2*π*x/a) dx`\n5.  **Solve using Python:** We will use Python's `scipy` library, which has a function `scipy.integrate.quad` for performing numerical integration. This is a reliable way to get an accurate numerical result. In the calculation, the length of the box `a` cancels out, so we can set `a=1` for simplicity.\n\nThe Python code below will define the probability density function, perform the integration over the specified interval, and print the result in the form of the complete equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# --- Problem Parameters ---\n# Quantum number\nn = 2\n# Length of the box 'a'. It cancels out, so we set it to 1.0 for calculation.\na = 1.0\n# Interval boundaries\nx1 = 0.495 * a\nx2 = 0.505 * a\n\n# --- Probability Density Function ---\n# The function to be integrated: |psi_n(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a)\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the probability density for a particle in a 1D box.\"\"\"\n    return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# Use scipy.integrate.quad to perform the numerical integration.\n# It returns the integral result and an estimate of the absolute error.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# --- Output ---\n# Print the final equation showing all the numbers and the calculated result.\n# The result is formatted in scientific notation for clarity.\nprint(\"The probability is calculated by the integral:\")\nprint(f\"P = Integral from {x1} to {x2} of (2/{a})*sin^2({n}*pi*x/{a}) dx = {probability:.6e}\")\n```\n<<<6.579736e-06>>>"
