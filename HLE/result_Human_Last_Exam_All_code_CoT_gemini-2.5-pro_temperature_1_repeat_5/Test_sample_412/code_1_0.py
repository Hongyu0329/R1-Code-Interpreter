# The problem asks to identify the property equivalent to continuity
# for a map f: X -> Y in the context of nonstandard analysis.

# Let's review the options:
# A. For standard points x0, x1: x0 ~ x1 implies f(x0) ~ f(x1). (Trivial)
# B. For standard x0 and any x1 in X*: x0 ~ x1 implies f(x0) ~ f(x1). (Correct)
# C. For any x0, x1 in X*: x0 ~ x1 implies f(x0) ~ f(x1). (S-continuity, stronger)
# D. For standard points x0, x1: f(x0) ~ f(x1) implies x0 ~ x1. (Injectivity)
# E. For standard x0 and any x1 in X*: f(x0) ~ f(x1) implies x0 ~ x1. (Incorrect)
# F. For any x0, x1 in X*: f(x0) ~ f(x1) implies x0 ~ x1. (Incorrect)

# As explained in the thinking steps, the nonstandard characterization of continuity
# at a standard point x0 is that f maps the monad of x0 into the monad of f(x0).
# This is precisely what statement B describes, for all standard points in X.
