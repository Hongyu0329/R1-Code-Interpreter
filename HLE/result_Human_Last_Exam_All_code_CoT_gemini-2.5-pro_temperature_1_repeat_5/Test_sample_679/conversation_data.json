    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula is $C_7H_{14}$. For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with 7 carbons, the formula would be $C_7H_{16}$ ($C_nH_{2n+2}$). The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This could be one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**:\n    *   The chemical shifts at `145 ppm` and `112 ppm` are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm), confirming the presence of a C=C double bond.\n    *   Let's analyze the multiplicity of each signal, which tells us the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon:\n        *   `145(s)`: 's' for singlet means a quaternary carbon (C) with 0 hydrogens. This is one of the alkene carbons.\n        *   `112(t)`: 't' for triplet means a CH2 group. This is the other alkene carbon, so we have a terminal alkene, `>C=CH_2`.\n        *   `48(t)`: 't' for triplet means an alkane CH2 group.\n        *   `27(d)`: 'd' for doublet means a CH group.\n        *   `22(q)`: 'q' for quartet means a CH3 group.\n        *   `21(q)`: 'q' for quartet means another CH3 group.\n\n3.  **Account for all Atoms**:\n    *   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n    *   The NMR data provides 6 distinct carbon signals. This means that either the molecule has symmetry, causing two carbons to be chemically equivalent, or two non-equivalent carbons have accidentally identical chemical shifts (as hinted by \"signal overlapping\").\n    *   Let's count the atoms based on the 6 signals: `C`, `CH2`, `CH2`, `CH`, `CH3`, `CH3`. This adds up to $C_6H_{12}$.\n    *   We are missing one `C` and two `H` atoms from the formula $C_7H_{14}$. This doesn't form a stable fragment.\n    *   Let's reconsider the idea of equivalent carbons. If one of the methyl signals (`q`) represented two equivalent `CH3` groups, our fragments would be: `C` (quat), `CH2` (alkene), `CH2` (alkane), `CH` (alkane), two equivalent `CH3` groups, and one other `CH3` group.\n    *   Let's count the atoms with this assumption: C = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7. H = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + (2*3) + 3 = 14. This matches the molecular formula perfectly.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   We start with the `>C=CH_2` fragment.\n    *   The remaining fragments are an alkane `-CH_2-` group, a `-CH-` group, and three `-CH_3` groups (two of which are equivalent).\n    *   A `-CH-` group bonded to two equivalent `-CH_3` groups forms an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH_3)_2`.\n    *   The remaining `-CH_2-` and `-CH_3` fragments form an ethyl group, `-CH_2CH_3`.\n    *   The only way to assemble these pieces is to attach both the isopropyl group and the ethyl group to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n              CH(CH3)2\n              |\n        CH2 = C\n              |\n              CH2CH3\n        ```\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**:\n    *   Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond (both carbons).\n    *   Path A: `CH2=C-CH2-CH3`. This is a 4-carbon chain (but-1-ene). It has one complex substituent at C2: an isopropyl group.\n    *   Path B: `CH2=C-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This is also a 4-carbon chain (but-1-ene). It has two simpler substituents: an ethyl group at C2 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, when there is a tie for the longest chain, we choose the one with the greater number of substituents. Path B has two substituents, while Path A has one. Therefore, we choose Path B.\n    *   Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond: `CH2(1)=C(2)-CH(3)-CH3(4)`.\n    *   Name and alphabetize the substituents: `2-ethyl`, `3-methyl`.\n    *   Combine everything to get the final name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to identify the compound\n    and prints the final IUPAC name.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_data = \"145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the molecular formula.\")\n    print(f\"The formula is {formula}.
