    "To find the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Properties of X**: $X$ is a smooth complex surface (a real 4-dimensional manifold) defined by a degree 5 polynomial in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X) = 0$).\n\n2.  **Compute the Betti Numbers**: To understand the topology of $X$, we'll compute its Betti numbers ($b_i = \\text{rank}(H_i(X))$).\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (since $X$ is connected).\n    *   $b_1 = 0$ (since $\\pi_1(X) = 0$).\n    *   By Poincar√© duality for a 4-manifold, $b_4 = b_0 = 1$ and $b_3 = b_1 = 0$.\n    *   To find $b_2$, we first compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. This can be found using Chern classes. For a degree $d=5$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Euler characteristic is $\\chi(X)=55$.\n    *   Since $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$, we have $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1$, which gives $b_2 = 53$.\n    *   So, the Betti numbers are $(1, 0, 53, 0, 1)$.\n\n3.  **Relate Homology to Homotopy**: For a simply connected, non-rational, and non-ruled smooth projective surface, a theorem from algebraic topology states that the rank of the third homotopy group is determined by the second Betti number. A quintic surface is of general type and thus satisfies these conditions. The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is given by the rank of Whitehead's universal quadratic functor $\\Gamma$ applied to the second homology group $H_2(X)$. Since $H_2(X)$ is a free abelian group of rank $b_2=53$, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{b_2}{2}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rank**: We will compute $\\binom{53}{2}$ to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code carries out this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_pi3_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define parameters for the smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3\n    n = 3  # Dimension of the ambient projective space CP^n\n    d = 5  # Degree of the hypersurface\n\n    print(f\"The hypersurface X is a smooth surface of degree d={d} in CP^{n}.\")\n    print(f\"The complex dimension of X is k = n-1 = {n-1}.\")\n    print(f\"The real dimension of X is 2k = {2*(n-1)}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the Euler characteristic chi(X)\n    # For a hypersurface of degree d in CP^n, the Euler characteristic can be computed\n    # from its Chern classes.
