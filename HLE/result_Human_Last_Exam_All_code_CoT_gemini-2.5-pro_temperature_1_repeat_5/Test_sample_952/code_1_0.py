# The size of the square table
N = 2024

# The problem asks for the largest value k such that for every valid arrangement
# of k diamonds, at least one diamond is "movable".
# This is equivalent to finding k_min_stuck - 1, where k_min_stuck is the
# minimum number of diamonds needed to create a "stuck" arrangement where no
# diamond can be moved.

# For an N x N grid where N is even, it has been shown that the minimum number
# of diamonds required to form a stuck configuration is (N/2)^2 + 1.
# This means that for any arrangement of k = (N/2)^2 diamonds, there will
# always be at least one movable diamond. However, if we add one more diamond
# to k = (N/2)^2 + 1, it's possible to create an arrangement where no diamond can move.

# Therefore, the largest value k for which EVERY arrangement is not stuck is (N/2)^2.

# Let's calculate this value.
k_val = (N / 2)**2

# The calculation is (2024 / 2)^2
