    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral to be evaluated is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`, whose antiderivative is `ln|f(x)|`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\n3.  **Calculate F₃(x) at the limits:**\n    *   First, let's write out `F₃(x)` explicitly:\n        *   `F₀(x) = x`\n        *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n        *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n        *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   Now, evaluate `F₃(x)` at x=0 and x=1:\n        *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n        *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   Since `F₃(x)` is always positive for x in [0, 1], we can drop the absolute value signs.\n\n4.  **Calculate the value of the integral (V):**\n    *   `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** We will use a Python script to compute the numerical value of V, multiply it by 10000, and find the closest integer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the function F3(x) and calculate its values at x=0 and x=1\n# F3(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n# Calculate F3(0)\n# sin(0) = 0\n# e^0 = 1\n# 1 + 1 = 2\n# ln(2)\nf3_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate F3(1)\n# sin(1) is sin(1 radian)\nsin_1 = math.sin(1)\nexp_sin_1 = math.exp(sin_1)\nf3_1 = math.log(1 + exp_sin_1)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the value of the integral V\n# V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\nV = math.log(f3_1) - math.log(f3_0)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final result\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\n# Print the results as requested\nprint(\"The integral evaluates to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) = {f3_0}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_1}\")\nprint(f\"The value of the integral V is ln({f3_1}) - ln({f3_0}) = {V}\")\nprint(f\"The value of 10000 * V is {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is {closest_integer}\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format\n# print(f'<<<{closest_integer}>>>')\n```\n<<<5488>>>"
