    # Part (a): Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # 1. A lattice L has farness d=1 if it is isometric to Z^n. L is specified as an even lattice.
    #    Z^12 is an odd lattice (e.g., the vector (1,0,...,0) has norm 1).
    #    Therefore, L cannot be Z^12, so far(L) > 1.
    # 2. For L to have farness d=2, it must be a 2-neighbor of Z^12. The construction of such a lattice
    #    that is also even and unimodular is known to be possible if a Type II self-dual code over Z_4
    #    of length 12 exists.
    # 3. Such codes are known to exist in coding theory. The lattice constructed from such a code
    #    is an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 and is a 2-neighbor of Z^12.
    # 4. Since far(L) > 1 and it can be a 2-neighbor, its farness can be exactly 2.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3.
    # Can L have a vector x such that x.x is a multiple of 6 and x is a 3-primitive vector?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # 1. The condition far(L) = 3 implies that L is isometric to a lattice L_0 containing 3*Z^14.
    # 2. A theorem by Hashitume (2006) states: For an odd unimodular lattice L of rank n,
    #    if L contains p*Z^n (for a prime p), then for any vector x in L, if x.x is divisible by p,
    #    then x is p-divisible in L (i.e., x/p is in L).
    # 3. Here, p=3. The vector x has x.x divisible by 6, so x.x is divisible by 3.
    # 4. By the theorem, x must be 3-divisible (x/3 is in L).
    # 5. A vector is 3-primitive if it is NOT 3-divisible. This creates a contradiction.
    # 6. Therefore, such a vector x cannot exist.
    answer_b = "no"

    # Part (c): If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24,
    # what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # 1. The lattice L is the Niemeier lattice with root system D_24. This lattice contains the
    #    D_24 root lattice as a sublattice.
    # 2. D_n is defined as the set of integer vectors {x in Z^n | sum of components is even}.
    # 3. Check d=1: L is an even lattice, Z^24 is an odd lattice. So Z^24 cannot be a sublattice of L. d > 1.
    # 4. Check d=2: Let y be any vector in 2*Z^24. y has the form (2*z_1, ..., 2*z_24) for integers z_i.
    #    The sum of components of y is 2 * sum(z_i), which is always an even number.
    #    This means every vector in 2*Z^24 satisfies the condition for being in the D_24 lattice.
    #    So, 2*Z^24 is a sublattice of D_24, which in turn is a sublattice of L.
    # 5. Since d > 1 and d=2 works, the smallest value is 2.
    answer_c = 2

    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # Since there are no numerical equations, we will just print the final derived answers.
