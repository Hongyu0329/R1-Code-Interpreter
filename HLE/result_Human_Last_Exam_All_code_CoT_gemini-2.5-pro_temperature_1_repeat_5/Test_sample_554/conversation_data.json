    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to establish the chemical formula of a standard nanocar. A \"nanocar\" is a single-molecule machine, and we will use the well-known structure of the chassis from the first nanocar synthesized by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the Nanocar Structure**: The chassis of this nanocar is a molecule named 1,2,4,5-tetra(phenylethynyl)benzene.\n2.  **Count the Hydrogen Atoms**: We need to count the total number of hydrogen atoms (H) in this structure.\n    *   The central benzene ring is substituted at four positions (1, 2, 4, 5), leaving 2 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   There are four phenylethynyl groups attached. Each terminal phenyl group (-C6H5) is attached at one position, leaving 5 hydrogen atoms on each.\n3.  **Apply the \"Perfluoro-\" Prefix**: The prefix \"perfluoro-\" signifies that every hydrogen atom in the original molecule has been replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\n4.  **Calculate the Final Number**: The total number of fluorine atoms will be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms calculated in step 2.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \n    This is based on the chassis of the first nanocar from the Tour group,\n    which has a structure of 1,2,4,5-tetra(phenylethynyl)benzene.\n    The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the number of hydrogens in each part of the molecule.\n    \n    # The central benzene ring is tetrasubstituted, leaving 2 hydrogens.\n    h_central_ring = 2\n    \n    # There are 4 outer phenyl groups.\n    num_outer_groups = 4\n    \n    # Each outer phenyl group is monosubstituted, leaving 5 hydrogens.\n    h_per_outer_group = 5\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n    # This will be equal to the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version.\n    total_fluorine_atoms = h_central_ring + (num_outer_groups * h_per_outer_group)\n    \n    # Step 3: Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(\"To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a 'perfluoronanocar', we first count the hydrogens in a standard nanocar chassis.\")\n    print(\"The structure is based on 1,2,4,5-tetra(phenylethynyl)benzene.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation steps:\")\n    print(f\"1. Hydrogens on the central ring: {h_central_ring}\")\n    print(f\"2. Hydrogens on the 4 outer phenyl groups: {num_outer_groups} groups * {h_per_outer_group} H/group\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe term 'perfluoro-' means all these hydrogens are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"The total number of fluorine atoms is calculated with the following equation:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with all numbers\n    print(f\"{h_central_ring} + {num_outer_groups} * {h_per_outer_group} = {total_fluorine_atoms}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nA hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain {total_fluorine_atoms} fluorine atoms.\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms()\n```\n<<<22>>>"
