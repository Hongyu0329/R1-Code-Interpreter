Dodging the wind, a mob of crows flaps vainly
home like grey upturned umbrellas. They fly
to roost through squalls that steal each squawk, each call.
Inside, I warm my lips with fragrant tea
and wonder what nostalgic truths these birds
held for Chagall. Three more appear, skirt past

tall chimney stacks, a rush of roofs, blown past
the brush-blurred grey-blue dots of cars (all vainly
pinned down in queues and wishing they were birds).
And far below, my students start to fly
their study groups and migrate home for tea.
They wrap up warm and wave. Their wind-whisked calls
