    A transformer model is composed of layers, and each layer performs operations like matrix multiplication, addition, and activation functions (e.g., Softmax, ReLU).

    1.  Precision: 'Constant precision' means all numbers (weights, activations) are represented by a fixed number of bits, O(1).

    2.  Operation Complexity: With constant precision, the core arithmetic operations can be implemented by circuits of constant depth and polynomial size:
        -   Addition/Multiplication: Multiplication of two k-bit numbers is in TC0.
        -   Softmax/GeLU: These non-linear functions are not directly computable by simple circuits. However, they can be closely approximated by constant-degree polynomials. A constant-degree polynomial, which involves a constant number of multiplications and additions, is also computable in TC0.

    3.  Model Complexity: A standard transformer has a constant number of layers. The entire network is a constant-depth composition of these TC0-computable functions. The class TC0 is closed under constant-depth composition.

    Therefore, a transformer with a constant number of layers and constant precision is in TC0.

    1.  Model of Computation: 'Polynomial steps of chain-of-thought' means the transformer is applied autoregressively for P(n) steps, where n is the input size and P is a polynomial. This is equivalent to iterating a function F (the transformer) for P(n) times: F(F(...F(input)...)).

    2.  From Part 1, we established that the function F is in TC0.

    3.  Complexity of Iteration:
        -   A function in TC0 can be evaluated by a Turing Machine using logarithmic workspace (LOGSPACE).
        -   Iterating a LOGSPACE-computable function for a polynomial number of steps is a well-known characterization of the class P (problems solvable in polynomial time). The overall process simulates a polynomial-time Turing machine.
        -   Furthermore, this model is powerful enough to solve any problem in P (by reducing it to the iterated computation). This means the class is P-complete.

    Therefore, a constant-precision transformer with polynomial steps of reasoning represents the complexity class P.
