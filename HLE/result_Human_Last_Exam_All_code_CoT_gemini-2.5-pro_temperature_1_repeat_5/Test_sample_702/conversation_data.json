    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we can use standard results from homotopy theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the spaces:** The map is of the form $\\phi: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q) \\to \\Omega(S^p \\wedge S^q)$ with $p=4$ and $q=6$. The codomain can be simplified as $\\Omega(S^p \\wedge S^q) \\simeq \\Omega S^{p+q}$.\n2.  **Use the fiber sequence:** The connectivity of a map is determined by the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. There is a known fiber sequence in homotopy theory for maps of this type. The fiber $F$ of the map $\\phi$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega^2 S^{p+q+2}$.\n3.  **Calculate the connectivity of the fiber:** A space is $k$-connected if all its homotopy groups up to dimension $k$ are trivial. The connectivity of the space $\\Omega^k S^n$ is known to be $(n-k-1)$, for $n>k$.\n4.  **Calculate the connectivity of the map:** If the fiber $F$ of a map is $m$-connected, then the map itself is $(m+1)$-connected.\n5.  **Synthesize the result:** We will combine these steps to calculate the final connectivity value. I will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\nThe script will take $p=4$ and $q=6$ as input and compute the connectivity step-by-step as outlined above.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)\n    for p=4 and q=6.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 4\n    q = 6\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the connectivity of the map:\")\n    print(f\"phi: Sigma(Omega S^{p} wedge Omega S^{q}) -> Omega(S^{p} wedge S^{q}) for p={p}, q={q}.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify the key components of the map.\")\n    print(f\"The map involves spheres of dimension p = {p} and q = {q}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identify the homotopy fiber of the map.\")\n    print(\"According to a result in homotopy theory, the fiber F of this map is equivalent to Omega^k S^n,\")\n    print(\"where k relates to the number of loop-space operators and n is determined by p and q.\")\n    k = 2\n    n = p + q + 2\n    print(f\"For this map, the fiber F is homotopy equivalent to Omega^{k} S^{n}.\")\n    print(f\"Here, k = {k} and n = p + q + 2 = {p} + {q} + 2 = {n}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the connectivity of the fiber F.\")\n    print(\"The connectivity of a space Omega^k S^n is given by the formula (n - k - 1).\")\n    connectivity_fiber = n - k - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of F = n - k - 1 = {n} - {k} - 1 = {connectivity_fiber}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Calculate the connectivity of the map phi.\")\n    print(\"The connectivity of a map is one greater than the connectivity of its fiber.\")\n    connectivity_map = connectivity_fiber + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the map = (Connectivity of F) + 1 = {connectivity_fiber} + 1 = {connectivity_map}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\n    print(\"The connectivity of the map is given by the final calculation:\")\n    # The final print shows each number in the equation.\n    print(f\"{connectivity_map} = ({p} + {q} + {k}) - {k} - 1 + 1\")\n    \n    # This is for the final answer block and should not be printed in the console\n    sys.stdout = open('/dev/null', 'w')\n    print(f'<<<{connectivity_map}>>>')\n\nsolve_connectivity()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
