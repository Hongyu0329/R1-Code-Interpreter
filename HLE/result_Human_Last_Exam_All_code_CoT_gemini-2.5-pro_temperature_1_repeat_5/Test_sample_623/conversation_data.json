    "To solve this problem, we need to trace the path of the labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and the subsequent pyruvate decarboxylation step, which is the first point where CO2 is released.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Labeled Glucose:** We'll represent the 1,4-13C glucose molecule, noting which carbons (C1 and C4) are isotopically labeled.\n2.  **Simulate Glycolysis:** Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. We need to track which original carbons from glucose end up in each pyruvate.\n    *   One pyruvate molecule is formed from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose.\n    *   The other pyruvate molecule is formed from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose.\n3.  **Trace Carbons to Pyruvate:** We will map the specific carbons from glucose to their new positions in the two pyruvate molecules. The carbon numbering in pyruvate is C1 (carboxyl), C2 (keto), C3 (methyl).\n    *   For the first pyruvate: Glucose C4 -> Pyruvate C1, Glucose C5 -> Pyruvate C2, Glucose C6 -> Pyruvate C3.\n    *   For the second pyruvate: Glucose C3 -> Pyruvate C1, Glucose C2 -> Pyruvate C2, Glucose C1 -> Pyruvate C3.\n4.  **Simulate CO2 Release:** The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) reaction converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and releases the C1 (carboxyl) carbon of pyruvate as a CO2 molecule.\n5.  **Count Labeled CO2:** We will check if the C1 carbon of each pyruvate was derived from a labeled carbon (C1 or C4) of the original glucose. The sum of these will give the final answer.\n6.  **Generate Code:** A Python script will be created to automate this tracing and calculation, printing out the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glucose_carbons():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and pyruvate\n    decarboxylation to determine how many labeled CO2 molecules are released.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the labeled glucose.\n    # We use 1 for a 13C label and 0 for an unlabeled 12C.\n    # Glucose carbons are numbered 1 to 6.
