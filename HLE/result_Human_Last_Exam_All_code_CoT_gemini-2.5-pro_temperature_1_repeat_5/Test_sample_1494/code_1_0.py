    This function explains the theoretical derivation of the time-decay rate
    for the given Stokes transport system and prints the final result.
    
    The problem asks for the best time-decay for ||d_x rho(t)||_{L^2}.
    The derivation, outlined below, shows that the decay is algebraic,
    of the form C * t^(a/b).

    # --- Theoretical Derivation ---
    # 1. Linearization:
    # We linearize the system around the equilibrium rho_eq = 1-z, u=0.
    # Let rho = rho_eq + theta. The linearized equation for the perturbation theta is:
    #   d_t theta - u_z = 0
    # The fluid velocity u is driven by the buoyancy of theta via the Stokes equation:
    #   -Delta u + grad p = -theta * e_z
    #   div u = 0

    # 2. Fourier Analysis and Enhanced Dissipation:
    # We analyze the system in the Fourier domain for the x-variable (x -> k).
    # The linearized system for the k-th Fourier mode theta_k(t, z) is:
    #   d_t theta_k = u_{z,k}
    # By solving the Stokes system for u_{z,k}, one finds that for small k, the
    # velocity is related to theta_k by an operator that introduces a k^2 factor.
    # Schematically: u_{z,k} ~ -C * k^2 * Operator_in_z(theta_k).
    # This leads to an effective evolution equation for theta_k:
    #   d_t theta_k ~ -C * k^2 * theta_k
    # This is a key result: the system exhibits enhanced dissipation. The decay rate
    # for a mode k is proportional to k^2, which is the same scaling as a
    # standard diffusion process (like the heat equation) in the x-direction.

    # 3. L^2 Norm Calculation:
    # We want the decay of ||d_x rho(t)||^2_{L^2} = ||d_x theta(t)||^2_{L^2}.
    # Using Parseval's theorem, this norm can be written as an integral over
    # the wavenumber k (assuming a large torus or non-compact domain):
    #   ||d_x theta(t)||^2_{L^2} = integral( k^2 * |theta_k(t)|^2 dk )
    #
    # Substituting the decay of each mode, |theta_k(t)|^2 ~ |theta_k(0)|^2 * exp(-2*C*k^2*t):
    #   ||d_x theta(t)||^2_{L^2} ~ integral( k^2 * |theta_k(0)|^2 * exp(-2*C*k^2*t) dk )

    # 4. Long-Time Asymptotics:
    # For long times t, the integral is dominated by the behavior of the integrand
    # near k=0. For generic, smooth initial data, |theta_k(0)|^2 is approximately
    # constant for small k.
    # So, ||d_x theta(t)||^2_{L^2} is proportional to integral( k^2 * exp(-2*C*k^2*t) dk ).
    #
    # By a change of variables s = k * sqrt(t), the integral is found to be
    # proportional to t^(-3/2).
    #   ||d_x rho(t)||^2_{L^2} ~ t^(-3/2)
    #
    # Taking the square root gives the decay rate for the norm itself:
    #   ||d_x rho(t)||_{L^2} ~ t^(-3/4)

    # Final result:
    # The exponent is -3/4.
