    print(" - If the system hits 0 when m=1 or m=2, it means a particle hit 0 before activating the next one (e.g., at x2 or x3). In this case, the random walk is confined between two boundaries (e.g., 0 and x2), and the expected hitting time is always finite.")
    print(" - If the system activates all 3 particles, we have m=3. Since 3 > 2, the expected time for this 3-particle system to hit 0 is finite.")
    print("Since every possible sequence of events leads to a finite expected time, the total E[T] is a sum of finite values and is therefore finite. This holds true for any initial positions x1, x2, x3.")
