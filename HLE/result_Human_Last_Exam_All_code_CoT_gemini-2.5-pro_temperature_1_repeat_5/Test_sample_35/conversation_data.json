    "Of course. Let's break down this poker problem with a quantitative approach.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** We are in a poker tournament, UTG+1 (an early position), near the money bubble, with a 16 big blind (bb) stack. This stack size is ideal for a \"push-or-fold\" strategy. The bubble pressure means our opponents will likely fold more often, increasing our \"fold equity\".\n2.  **Use an Expected Value (EV) Calculation:** To decide which hand is the best to shove (go all-in), we can calculate the EV of the play for each option. A positive EV means the play is profitable in the long run. The formula for the EV of a shove is:\n    `EV = (Probability_Opponents_Fold * Pot_Won) + (Probability_Opponent_Calls * Equity_When_Called)`\n3.  **Establish Assumptions:** To use the formula, we need to estimate some variables:\n    *   **Pot Size:** We'll assume a 9-handed table with a Small Blind (0.5bb), a Big Blind (1bb), and antes totaling 1bb. So, the initial pot is 2.5bb.\n    *   **Fold Probability:** Given our early position and the intense bubble pressure, opponents will play very tight. We'll estimate a high fold probability (`P_fold`) of 70% (0.7). The probability of being called (`P_call`) is therefore 30% (0.3).\n    *   **Calling Range & Equity:** When we are called, it will be by a very strong range of hands. We'll assume a tight calling range of `99+` (pocket nines or better), `AQs+` (Ace-Queen suited or better), and `AKo` (Ace-King offsuit). We will use established poker tools to find our hand's equity (chance of winning) against this specific range.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will write a Python script to plug these numbers into the EV formula for each of the hand choices (QJs, 99, AJo, AKo) and print the results. The hand with the highest EV is the best choice.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_shove_ev(hand_name, equity_vs_calling_range):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the Expected Value (EV) of shoving a specific hand.\n    \n    The EV formula is:\n    EV = (P_fold * pot_before_shove) + (P_call * (our_equity * total_pot_when_called - amount_risked))\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- 1.
