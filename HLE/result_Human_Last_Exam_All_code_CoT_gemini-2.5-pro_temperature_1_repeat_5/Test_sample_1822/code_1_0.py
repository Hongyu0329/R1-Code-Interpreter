# Define the given parameters from the problem description
# c: Confidence of the discriminatory pattern in the subgraph G
c = 0.85
# s: Support of the discriminatory pattern
s = 0.12
# c_prime: Confidence of the anti-correlation in the 2-hop neighborhood
c_prime = 0.78
# beta: Bottleneck coefficient of the knowledge graph
beta = 0.23

# The evidence for the violation is proportional to its confidence and support.
evidence_violation = c * s

# The evidence for it being a statistical artifact is based on the
# contradictory evidence (c_prime), but this is mitigated by the bottleneck
# structure (beta). A strong bottleneck (low beta) makes such discrepancies
# more likely, strengthening the artifact argument. Thus, the evidence for an
# artifact is inversely proportional to beta.
# This leads to the formula: E_r = (c * s) / (c_prime / beta)
# which simplifies to: E_r = (c * s * beta) / c_prime

# Calculate the minimum ratio of evidence (E_r)
E_r = (c * s * beta) / c_prime

# Output the final equation with the numbers plugged in, as requested.
