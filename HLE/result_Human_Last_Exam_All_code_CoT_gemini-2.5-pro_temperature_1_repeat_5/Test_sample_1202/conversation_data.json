    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided options to determine the most likely mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the core question:** The question asks for a mechanism that explains two outcomes for duplicated genes: 1) **Retention** (why the extra copy isn't lost) and 2) **Divergence** (how the two copies become different in a functionally meaningful way).\n2.  **Evaluate each option:** I will assess each choice based on whether it promotes both retention and divergence.\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process makes homologous DNA sequences more similar to each other. It actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, it's an incorrect choice.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one gene copy becomes non-functional due to mutations. While the non-functional \"pseudogene\" is technically retained in the genome for some time, this mechanism describes a *loss* of function, not the retention of two *functional*, diverging genes. It is the most common fate, but not a mechanism for retaining functional duplicates.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one copy of the gene retains the original function, while the second copy acquires brand new, beneficial mutations that give it a novel function. Selection then acts to preserve this new function, ensuring the **retention** of the second copy and promoting its **divergence** from the original. This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns. After duplication, each copy loses a different, complementary subset of the original functions through mutation. Now, both genes are required to carry out the complete original function. This necessity ensures the **retention** of both copies, and the different mutations they accumulate lead to their **divergence**. This is also a very strong candidate.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a species rapidly diversifies into many new ones. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material for this process, adaptive radiation itself is a macroevolutionary outcome, not the specific molecular mechanism of gene retention and divergence. It operates at the wrong biological scale.\n3.  **Compare the best options (C and D):** Both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are the primary accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. Neofunctionalization is the classic model focused on creating novel function. Subfunctionalization explains how duplicates can be preserved by partitioning existing functions, which is considered a very common pathway. However, Neofunctionalization most directly describes the evolution of a *new* function, which represents a powerful form of divergence and evolutionary innovation. In the context of a multiple-choice question, it is often presented as the canonical answer for how duplicate genes lead to new traits.\n\nThe following Python script will systematically analyze each option and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    \"\"\"\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'description': 'A process that results in one DNA sequence replacing a homologous sequence, leading to homogenization.
