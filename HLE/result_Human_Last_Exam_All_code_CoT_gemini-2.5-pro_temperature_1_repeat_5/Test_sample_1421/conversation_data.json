    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function in the imaginary time path integral formalism. The following Python code will print the formula and a description of its components.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define strings in Python that represent the mathematical formula for the partition function, `Z`, and the Euclidean action, `S`.\n2.  Use the `print()` function to display these formulas in a clear, readable format.\n3.  Provide a detailed breakdown of each symbol in the formula, including the integration limits `0` and `β`, to satisfy the prompt's request to \"output each number in the final equation.\"\n4.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
