    Calculates the constant C in the asymptotic relation lim_{k->inf} ln(h_k)/ln(k) = C*alpha.

    Based on the derivation:
    1.  ln(h_k) is proportional to the difference in resistance to infinity between A_k and (A_k union B_k).
        ln(h_k) ≈ -2 * alpha * pi * (R(A_k union B_k) - R(A_k))
    2.  For large k, A_k and B_k act as parallel resistors.
        R(A_k union B_k) - R(A_k) ≈ -R(A_k)
    3.  The resistance of A_k = {(0,0), (0,k^3)} is R(A_k) ≈ (3/pi) * ln(k).
    4.  Combining these gives ln(h_k) ≈ 2 * alpha * pi * (3/pi) * ln(k) = 6 * alpha * ln(k).
    5.  Therefore, the limit is 6 * alpha. The constant is 6.
