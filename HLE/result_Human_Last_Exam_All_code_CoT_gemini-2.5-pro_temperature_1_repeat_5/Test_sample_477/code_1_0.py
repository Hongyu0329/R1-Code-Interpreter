      "DNA Ligase I (LIG1) is a critical enzyme for joining DNA fragments during replication and repair. "
      "In Myotonic Dystrophy, the expanded CTG repeats form stable hairpin structures that can interfere with these processes, leading to DNA breaks. "
      "LIG1 is required to seal these breaks and complete the repair. "
      "Scientific studies have demonstrated that when LIG1 is deficient, the repair process becomes faulty. "
      "This leads to improper processing of the DNA near the repeat tract, which promotes further expansions rather than accurate repair. "
      "Consequently, a lack of LIG1 function results in an exacerbation of the CTG repeat expansion."
