    "Here is a step-by-step plan to derive the analytical formula for the integral.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$. For small positive $\\epsilon$, the integrand has a sharp peak where the denominator is smallest. Let $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. The minimum of $f(x)$ on the interval $[0, 15.00]$ occurs at $x=0$, where $f(0)=0$. This means the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the Denominator:** For $x$ close to 0, the term $9.0x^{5.0}$ is the dominant part of $f(x)$. We can therefore approximate $f(x) \\approx 9.0x^{5.0}$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the Integral:** We can now approximate the integral by using the simplified form of $f(x)$. Also, because the contribution from the region near $x=0$ is so dominant, we can extend the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ without significantly affecting the leading-order result. This makes the integral analytically solvable.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$.\n\n4.  **Solve the Approximate Integral:** To solve this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = \\frac{9x^5}{\\epsilon}$. This implies $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon u}{9}\\right)^{1/5}$ and $dx = \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5}u^{-4/5}du$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5}u^{-4/5}du$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5\\epsilon} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n\n5.  **Use a Standard Integral Formula:** The remaining integral is a well-known result related to the Beta function, given by $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{z-1}}{1+t} dt = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$. For our integral, $z-1 = -4/5$, so $z=1/5$.\n    Thus, $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n6.  **Final Analytical Formula:** Combining the results, we get the approximate formula:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n    This can be written as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^p$, where the exponent is $p = -4/5 = -0.8$ and the coefficient is $C = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical values for the coefficient $C$ and the exponent $p$ and prints the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The analytical formula is of the form I(epsilon) = C * epsilon**p\n\n# 1. Define the constants from the derivation\np_num = -4.0\np_den = 5.0\nc_num_factor = math.pi\nc_den_factor1 = 5.0\nc_den_factor2 = 9.0\nc_den_factor3_power = 1.0/5.0\nc_den_factor4_arg = math.pi / 5.0\n\n# 2. Calculate the exponent p\np = p_num / p_den\n\n# 3. Calculate the coefficient C\n# C = pi / (5 * 9**(1/5) * sin(pi/5))\nc_den_factor4 = math.sin(c_den_factor4_arg)\ncoefficient_C = c_num_factor / (c_den_factor1 * (c_den_factor2**c_den_factor3_power) * c_den_factor4)\n\n# 4. Print the numbers in the final equation and the formula itself\nprint(\"The analytical approximation for the integral I(epsilon) is of the form: I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon**p\")\nprint(f\"The value of the exponent p is {p_num}/{p_den}, which is:\")\nprint(p)\nprint(\"\\nThe coefficient C is calculated as pi / (5.0 * 9.0**(1.0/5.0) * sin(pi/5.0)). Its value is:\")\nprint(coefficient_C)\nprint(\"\\nThus, the final approximate formula is:\")\nprint(f\"I(epsilon) ≈ {coefficient_C} * epsilon**({p})\")\n\n```\n<<<0.689163889453396>>>"
