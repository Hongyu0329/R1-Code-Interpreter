    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence, we need to analyze its repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues, which dictates how the helices pack together. This is known as the \"knobs-into-holes\" model.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils have a seven-amino-acid repeat, denoted `abcdefg`. The residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are typically hydrophobic and form the core interface between the helices. I will analyze the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` to find the most likely `abcdefg` registration by looking for the frame that places the most hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n2.  **Extract Core Residues:** Once the frame is established, I will list the amino acids that occupy all the 'a' and 'd' positions throughout the sequence.\n3.  **Apply Packing Rules:** The size and type of residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions determine the most stable oligomeric state:\n    *   **Dimers** often have large hydrophobic residues (like I, L) at both 'a' and 'd'.\n    *   **Trimers** frequently have a small residue (like A) at the 'a' position and a large residue (like L, I) at the 'd' position. This allows the small 'a' residues to pack into the tight central core, while the large 'd' residues fill the larger grooves between helices.\n    *   **Tetramers** often have small residues at both 'a' and 'd' positions to avoid steric clash in a more crowded four-helix bundle.\n4.  **Conclude the Oligomeric State:** Based on the pattern of 'a' and 'd' residues found in the sequence, I will determine the most likely oligomeric state.\n\nI will now generate the Python code to perform this analysis and explain the result.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to determine its likely oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the protein sequence for coiled-coil characteristics.\")\n    print(f\"Sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # After analyzing all 7 possible frames, the one that maximizes hydrophobicity\n    # at 'a' and 'd' positions is chosen.
