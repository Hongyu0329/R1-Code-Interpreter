    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Riddle:** The question asks for a musical note corresponding to a specific range on Newton's color circle. The range is defined as being between \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\" and \"blue itself.\"\n2.  **Identify the Colors:**\n    *   First, determine the color produced by combining yellow and blue. In the context of light and pigments as arranged on a color wheel, this combination yields **Green**.\n    *   The second color is explicitly stated as **Blue**.\n    *   Therefore, the range in question is between Green and Blue.\n3.  **Apply Newton's Music-Color Analogy:** Isaac Newton associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the seven notes of a musical scale. In his model, the notes are not the colors themselves, but the *boundaries* between the color segments. The colors represent the musical intervals between the notes.\n    *   The interval for **Green** is the space between note **F** and note **G**.\n    *   The interval for **Blue** is the space between note **G** and note **A**.\n4.  **Find the Boundary Note:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the \"range between\" Green and Blue. In Newton's model, this means finding the note that serves as the boundary separating the Green interval from the Blue interval. The Green interval ends at G, and the Blue interval begins at G. Thus, the shared boundary note is **G**.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** The Python code will print this step-by-step logic, showing the color combination, the resulting color range, the corresponding musical intervals, and the final calculation to identify the boundary note.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by mapping Newton's color circle to musical notes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the colors from the riddle.\n    color_1 = \"Yellow\"\n    color_2 = \"Blue\"\n    mixed_color = \"Green\"\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Determine the color range.\")\n    print(f\"The combination of {color_1} and {color_2} produces the color {mixed_color}.\")\n    print(f\"The query is for the range between {mixed_color} and {color_2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain Newton's color-to-music interval mapping.\n    # In Newton's model, colors represent the intervals between notes.\n    green_interval = (\"F\", \"G\")\n    blue_interval = (\"G\", \"A\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply Newton's color-music analogy.\")\n    print(\"In this model, colors correspond to the musical intervals between notes.\")\n    print(f\"The color {mixed_color} represents the interval between note {green_interval[0]} and note {green_interval[1]}.\")\n    print(f\"The color {color_2} represents the interval between note {blue_interval[0]} and note {blue_interval[1]}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 3: Find the boundary note.\n    # The note \"between\" the two color ranges is the note they share as a boundary.\n    boundary_note = list(set(green_interval).intersection(set(blue_interval)))[0]\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Identify the boundary note.\")\n    print(\"The note that separates the Green interval from the Blue interval is the note they share.\")\n    \n    # Final Equation: Show the components that lead to the answer.\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Interval({mixed_color}) = (Note({green_interval[0]}), Note({green_interval[1]}))\")\n    print(f\"Interval({color_2}) = (Note({blue_interval[0]}), Note({blue_interval[1]}))\")\n    print(f\"Boundary Note = Intersection(Interval({mixed_color}), Interval({color_2})) = Note({boundary_note})\")\n\nsolve_newton_riddle()\n<<<G>>>\n```"
