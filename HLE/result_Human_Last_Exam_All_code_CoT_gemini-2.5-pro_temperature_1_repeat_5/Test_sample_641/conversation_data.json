    "This problem asks for the number of involutions in the finite group PSU(4, 997). An involution is an element of order 2.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  An element `x` in `PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))` is an involution if `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`. Let `x = gZ` where `g` is in `SU(n, q)` and `Z` is the center `Z(SU(n, q))`. The condition `x^2=1` translates to `g^2 ∈ Z`.\n2.  For PSU(4, 997), we have `n=4` and `q=997`. The order of the center `Z` is `d = gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. So, `Z = {I, -I}`.\n3.  We need to count the number of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`, and `g` is not in the center. The total count of these elements, divided by the order of the center (`|Z|=2`), gives the number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)`.\n4.  **Case 1: `g^2 = I`**. These are the involutions in `SU(4, 997)`. For `n=4`, there is only one conjugacy class of involutions in `SU(4, q)`, corresponding to elements with eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}`. The number of such elements is `q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\n5.  **Case 2: `g^2 = -I`**. We need to count the number of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` that are square roots of `-I`. For this to be possible in the unitary group `U(n, q)`, we need `q \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4` or `n` to be even when `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`. Here `n=4` is even and `q=997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, so such elements exist. The number of such elements in `SU(4, q)` for `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4` is `q^4(q + 1)(q^3 + 1)`.\n6.  The total number of pre-images of involutions in `SU(4, q)` is the sum from both cases:\n    `Total = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1) + q^4(q + 1)(q^3 + 1)`\n    `Total = q^4 * [(q^4 - q^3 + 2q^2 - q + 1) + (q^4 + q^3 + q + 1)]`\n    `Total = q^4 * [2q^4 + 2q^2 + 2] = 2q^4(q^4 + q^2 + 1)`\n7.  The number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is `Total / |Z| = 2q^4(q^4 + q^2 + 1) / 2 = q^4(q^4 + q^2 + 1)`.\n8.  Finally, I will use a Python script to compute this value for `q = 997`.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    The formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q = 1 (mod 4)\n    is N = q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # Using Python's arbitrary-precision integers for large number calculations\n    q2 = q * q\n    q4 = q2 * q2\n\n    # The final formula\n    num_involutions = q4 * (q4 + q2 + 1)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with numbers\n    print(\"The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"N = q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1), for q = 997\\n\")\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Let q = {q}\")\n    print(f\"q^2 = {q}^2 = {q2}\")\n    print(f\"q^4 = ({q2})^2 = {q4}\")\n    \n    sum_term = q4 + q2 + 1\n    \n    print(\"\\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"N = {q4} * ({q4} + {q2} + 1)\")\n    print(f\"N = {q4} * {sum_term}\")\n    print(f\"N = {num_involutions}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<976136364942099988112004001>>>"
