# The nearest point on the curve y=x^5 is (1,1), which corresponds to the parameter t=1.
t = 1

# The derivative of the signed distance function rho with respect to x is given by the formula:
# D_x rho = (-5 * t**4) / (1 + 5 * t**4)
# We evaluate this at t=1.

# Calculate the numerator of the fraction
numerator = -5 * (t**4)

# Calculate the denominator of the fraction
denominator = 1 + 5 * (t**4)

# Use sympy to represent the fraction to ensure it's not converted to a float.
final_fraction = sympy.Rational(numerator, denominator)

# Output the numbers in the final equation and the result
