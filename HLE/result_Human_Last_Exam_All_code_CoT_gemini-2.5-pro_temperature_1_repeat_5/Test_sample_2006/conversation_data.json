    "Of course, I can help you solve this riddle. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Riddle**: The problem is a riddle disguised as a haiku. The key is to find the hidden mathematical equation within the words.\n2.  **Analyze the Clues**:\n    *   The title, \"The Bays,\" is a pun on \"The Betas\" (β), which in mathematics often represent the roots of a quadratic equation (`ax² + bx + c = 0`).\n    *   The three lines of the haiku will provide the three coefficients: `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n    *   A careful look at the haiku suggests the numbers aren't literal (like \"August\" = 8) but are derived from the structure of the words themselves. The most likely method is by counting the letters in the words of each line.\n    *   The final instruction, \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\", implies there are multiple answers (the two roots of the equation) and they should be presented in numerical order.\n3.  **Formulate the Equation**:\n    *   **a (from line 1)**: `len(\"An\") + len(\"August\") + len(\"tempest\")` = `2 + 6 + 7` = `15`.\n    *   **b (from line 2)**: `len(\"Twice\") + len(\"fifteen\") + len(\"brings\") + len(\"winds\") + len(\"of\") + len(\"change\")` = `5 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 6` = `31`.\n    *   **c (from line 3)**: `len(\"A\") + len(\"divine\") + len(\"one\") + len(\"yields\")` = `1 + 6 + 3 + 6` = `16`.\n    *   This gives us the equation: `15x² + 31x + 16 = 0`.\n4.  **Solve and Present**: I will write a Python script to calculate these coefficients, solve the resulting quadratic equation for its two roots, and print the equation and the sorted roots as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_haiku_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle presented in the haiku by treating it as a\n    quadratic equation, where coefficients are derived from letter counts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The lines of the haiku\n    line1 = \"An August tempest\"\n    line2 = \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n    line3 = \"A divine one yields\"\n\n    # Calculate coefficients by summing the length of the words in each line\n    a = sum(len(word) for word in line1.split())\n    b = sum(len(word) for word in line2.split())\n    c = sum(len(word) for word in line3.split())\n\n    print(\"Based on the riddle, we form the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c} = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac)\n    discriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c\n\n    if discriminant < 0:\n        print(\"The equation has no real roots.\")\n    else:\n        # Use integer square root for precision since the discriminant is a perfect square (1)\n        sqrt_discriminant = math.isqrt(discriminant)\n\n        # Calculate the numerators and the common denominator\n        numerator1 = -b + sqrt_discriminant\n        numerator2 = -b - sqrt_discriminant\n        denominator = 2 * a\n\n        # Represent roots as fractions for exactness\n        root1 = Fraction(numerator1, denominator)\n        root2 = Fraction(numerator2, denominator)\n\n        # Sort the roots in numerical (\"alphabetical\") order\n        answers = sorted([root1, root2])\n\n        print(f\"The answers (the 'Bays'), in alphabetical order, are:\")\n        print(f\"Root 1: {answers[0]}\")\n        print(f\"Root 2: {answers[1]}\")\n\nsolve_haiku_riddle()\n```\n<<<-16/15, -1>>>"
