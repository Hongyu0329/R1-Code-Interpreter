# The problem reduces to finding the surface area of a sphere defined by the equation:
# x_0^2 + y_0^2 + z_0^2 = R^2
# From the derivation, we found the value of R^2.

# The sum of alpha, beta, and gamma is given as 10^25 * (1 - e^-T).
# The derived relationship is 2 * (x_0^2 + y_0^2 + z_0^2) * (1 - e^-T) = alpha + beta + gamma.
# This simplifies to 2 * R^2 = 10^25.

sum_coeff = 10**25
divisor = 2

# Calculate the radius squared (R^2) of the sphere.
R_squared = sum_coeff / divisor

# The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4 * pi * R^2.
# We will now calculate this area.
factor = 4
pi_val = math.pi

area = factor * pi_val * R_squared

# Print the final equation and the result.
