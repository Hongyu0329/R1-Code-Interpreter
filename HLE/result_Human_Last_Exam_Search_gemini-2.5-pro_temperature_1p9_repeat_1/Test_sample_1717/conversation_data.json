    "### Theoretical Maximum Health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode Approaches Infinity\n\nBased on an analysis of the game's mechanics as described in detailed community discussions of *Terraria's* source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players would also be infinite. The health scaling mechanic for bosses in multiplayer does not have a hard cap and continuously increases with each additional player.\n\nIn single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. When additional players join the server in Expert or Master Mode, the boss's health is multiplied by a scaling factor. For the first additional player (two players total), the health increases by 35% to 4,913.\n\nThe formula for health scaling becomes more complex as more players are added. For a small number of players, the health multiplier increases recursively. For ten or more players, a modified formula is used to make the increase less dramatic, but it still ensures that the health multiplier grows with each player. The scaling continues to increase up to the game's official player limit of 255, at which point the health multiplier is approximately 171.36.\n\nSince the health multiplier increases indefinitely with the number of players and does not approach a finite limit, it can be concluded that with a theoretical infinite number of players, the Eye of Cthulhu's health would also approach infinity.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
