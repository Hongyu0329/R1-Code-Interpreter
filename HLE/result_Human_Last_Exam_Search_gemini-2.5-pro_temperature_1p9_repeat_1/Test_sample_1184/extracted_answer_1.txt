The precise hotspot residues on the human beta-1 subunit for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit are located within the Alpha-Binding Pocket on its Guanylate Kinase domain. Key residues contributing to this interaction can be identified through structural analysis of the CaV2.3-Î²1 complex (PDB: 7XLQ) and are homologous to critical residues identified in other beta subunits. The hotspot residues for gating modulation are largely overlapping with the interaction hotspots in the GK domain, as the binding event itself is a primary driver of modulation. Additional modulation is provided by the SH3 and HOOK domains of the beta-1 subunit, with the specific residues contributing to isoform-specific effects.
