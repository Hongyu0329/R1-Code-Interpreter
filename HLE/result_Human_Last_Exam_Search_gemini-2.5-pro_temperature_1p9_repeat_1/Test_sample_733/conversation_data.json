    "There are exactly four families of finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. A subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for any elements *a, b, c* in *S* (not necessarily distinct), the relation *ab = c* does not hold. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the group.\n\nThe classification of such groups was provided by M. Giudici and S. Hart in their paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\" (the term \"sum-free\" is often used in the context of abelian groups but is analogous to \"product-free\" in the general group context).\n\nThe finite groups that have a maximal by inclusion product-free set *S* of size 2 fall into the following categories, where *S* = {*a, b*}:\n\n1.  **Cyclic groups:**\n    *   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted C₅, with the set *S* = {*a*, *a*²}, where *a* is a generator.\n    *   The cyclic group of order 6, denoted C₆, with the set *S* = {*a*², *a*³}, where *a* is a generator.\n\n2.  **Dihedral groups:**\n    *   The dihedral group of order 6, denoted D₆ (which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃), has a maximal product-free set of size 2. An example of such a set is {*r, s*}, where *r* is an element of order 3 and *s* is an element of order 2.\n    *   The dihedral group of order 8, denoted D₈, contains a maximal product-free set of size 2, for example, {*r*², *s*}, where *r* is an element of order 4 and *s* is an element of order 2.\n\nIn summary, there are four specific types of finite groups that possess maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. These groups are C₅, C₆, D₆, and D₈.\n\n<<<4>>>"
