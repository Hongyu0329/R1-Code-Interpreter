    "### The Minimal Triangulation of the Great Icosahedron's Outer Hull is 20 Triangles\n\nThe minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20. This conclusion is based on the geometric properties of the great icosahedron and its convex hull.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, characterized by its 20 intersecting triangular faces. The outer-hull, or convex hull, of the great icosahedron is the smallest convex shape that encloses it. For the great icosahedron, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. Triangulation of a surface involves dividing it into a set of triangles. Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already naturally divided into 20 triangular faces, the most straightforward and minimal triangulation is the set of its own faces. Any further subdivision would inherently increase the number of triangles.\n\nTherefore, the number of visible triangles from the outside, which corresponds to the faces of its convex hull, is precisely 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
