    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`, and then analyze the residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions. These positions are critical for the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing that drives coiled-coil formation and determines its oligomeric state.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nA heptad repeat is characterized by a recurring pattern where positions 'a' and 'd' are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. Let's analyze the positions of hydrophobic residues (I, L, A, W) in the sequence:\n\n`G E` **I(3) A(4)** `Q S` **L(7)** `K E` **I(10) A(11)** `K S` **L(14)** `K E` **I(17) A(18) W(19)** `S` **L(21)** `K E` **I(24) A(25)** `Q S` **L(28)** `K G`\n\nWe can observe a clear periodicity:\n*   Isoleucine (I) residues appear at positions 3, 10, 17, and 24 (a regular 7-residue spacing).\n*   Alanine (A) residues appear at positions 4, 11, 18, and 25 (also a 7-residue spacing).\n*   Leucine (L) residues appear at positions 7, 14, 21, and 28 (also a 7-residue spacing).\n\nIn a coiled-coil, the 'a' and 'd' positions are separated by two residues (`(a) b c (d)`). The distance between residue `A` at position 4 and residue `L` at position 7 is three amino acids. This spacing is characteristic of residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions, respectively.\n\nLet's establish the heptad frame based on `a = Alanine (A)` and `d = Leucine (L)`. If we assign the `A` at position 4 to the 'a' position, the sequence aligns into four heptad repeats, starting from residue `G` at position `e`.\n\n*   **Heptad 1:** `(e)G (f)E (g)I` **(a)A** `(b)Q (c)S` **(d)L**\n*   **Heptad 2:** `(e)K (f)E (g)I` **(a)A** `(b)K (c)S` **(d)L**\n*   **Heptad 3:** `(e)K (f)E (g)I` **(a)A** `(b)W (c)S` **(d)L**\n*   **Heptad 4:** `(e)K (f)E (g)I` **(a)A** `(b)Q (c)S` **(d)L**\n\nThis alignment shows a remarkably consistent pattern for the core positions: position 'a' is always Alanine (A) and position 'd' is always Leucine (L).\n\n### 2. Applying Knobs-into-Holes Packing Rules\n\nThe specific amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state due to packing constraints. Seminal studies on the GCN4 leucine zipper and other designed peptides have established a set of predictive rules.\n\n*   **Dimer Formation:** A common motif for dimeric coiled-coils is having Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position. The preference for a β-branched amino acid like Isoleucine or Valine at 'a' and a γ-branched one like Leucine at 'd' is sterically favorable in the parallel dimer interface.\n*   **Trimer Formation:** Trimers often form when the core positions are more symmetrical, for instance when both 'a' and 'd' positions are occupied by Isoleucine (I).\n*   **Tetramer Formation:** A reversal of the dimer-forming pattern, with Leucine (L) at the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position, promotes the formation of tetramers.\n\nIn the given sequence, we have **Alanine (A) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position.**\n\n*   The presence of Leucine at the 'd' position is a strong indicator for dimer formation.\n*   Alanine is a small, non-bulky hydrophobic residue. Placing it at the 'a' position does not introduce the steric hindrance that would destabilize a dimer. Instead, its small size is easily accommodated within the `a-a'` packing interface of a dimeric coiled-coil.\n*   The pattern does not match the requirements for trimers (e.g., I at 'a' and 'd') or tetramers (e.g., L at 'a', I at 'd').\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes interactions and packing efficiency, the `a=A`, `d=L` pattern strongly favors the formation of a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
