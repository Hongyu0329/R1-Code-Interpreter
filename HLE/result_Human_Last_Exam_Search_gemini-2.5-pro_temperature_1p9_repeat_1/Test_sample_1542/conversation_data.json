    "Over the finite ring R=Z/8Z, there are 20 equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables up to invertible linear transforms.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over the ring R=Z/8Z is a polynomial of the form q(x, y) = ax² + bxy + cy² where the coefficients a, b, and c are elements of Z/8Z. Two such forms, q1 and q2, are considered equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation of the variables that transforms q1 into q2. This means q2(x, y) = q1(αx + βy, γx + δy) for some matrix  (α β; γ δ)  that is invertible over Z/8Z.\n\nThe classification of quadratic forms over rings of the form Z/p^kZ, especially when p=2, is notably complex. Unlike fields of characteristic not equal to 2, diagonalization is not always possible. For the specific case of Z/8Z, a computational analysis has determined the number of these equivalence classes. According to these results, for quadratic forms in two variables (rank 2), there are 20 distinct equivalence classes over Z/8Z.\n\n<<<20>>>"
