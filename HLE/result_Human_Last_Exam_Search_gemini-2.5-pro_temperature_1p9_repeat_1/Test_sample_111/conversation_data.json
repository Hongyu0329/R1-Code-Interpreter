    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. At the time of her death, Geoffrey Chaucer was likely in Italy.\n\nIn 1368, Chaucer was abroad on diplomatic missions. He was in the service of Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, and as one of his esquires, he accompanied the Duke to Italy in April 1368 for his marriage to Violante Visconti, the daughter of the Lord of Milan. Lionel remained in Italy, celebrating his marriage, until his own death later in 1368. This indicates that Chaucer was part of the Duke's retinue in Italy for a prolonged period that year.\n\nFurthermore, records show that Chaucer had a warrant to pass through Dover on July 17, 1368, for travel to the continent, though his exact destination on this particular warrant is not specified. His military service in France is documented as occurring in 1369, making it distinct from his travels in 1368. While some details of his Italian journey are debated by scholars, the evidence strongly points to his presence in Italy during the late summer of 1368. Chaucer's first major poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" was written in commemoration of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\nGiven the timeline of his diplomatic duties with the Duke of Clarence in Milan, it is most probable that Chaucer was in Italy when Blanche of Lancaster passed away in England.\n\n<<<A>>>"
