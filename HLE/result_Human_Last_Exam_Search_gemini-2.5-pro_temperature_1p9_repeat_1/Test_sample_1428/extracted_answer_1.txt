The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is $P_j(t+1) = \frac{1}{2}P_{j-1}(t) + \frac{1}{2}P_{j+1}(t)$, with indices taken modulo N. The transition probability matrix $\hat{A}$ is a symmetric circulant matrix with $A_{j,j-1} = A_{j,j+1} = 1/2$ and other elements being zero. The eigenvectors are indeed $v_n$ with components $(v_n)_j = e^{i(2\pi n/N)j}$ for $n=0, 1, ..., N-1$, and the corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = \cos(2\pi n/N)$. The rate of relaxation is determined by the second-largest eigenvalue, which is $\lambda_{second} = \cos(2\pi/N)$.
