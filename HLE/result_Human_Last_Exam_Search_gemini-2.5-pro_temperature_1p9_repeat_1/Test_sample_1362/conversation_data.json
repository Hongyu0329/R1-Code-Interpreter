    "A curve has \"good ordinary reduction\" at a prime `p` if its reduction modulo `p` is a smooth (non-singular) curve and satisfies the \"ordinary\" condition. For a hyperelliptic curve given by the equation `z^2 = f(x)`, the first condition of good reduction for a prime `p > 2` is that the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` is not divisible by `p`. The question asks for a curve with good ordinary reduction for all primes `p > 2`. This implies that the discriminant of the corresponding polynomial `f(x)` must not have any odd prime factors, meaning it must be a power of 2 (possibly with a sign of -1).\n\nLet's analyze the discriminant for each of the given curves:\n\n*   **A. z^2 = x^5 + 3:** The polynomial is `f(x) = x^5 + 3`. The discriminant of `x^n + c` is `(-1)^(n(n-1)/2) * n^n * c^(n-1)`. For this curve, the discriminant is `(-1)^(10) * 5^5 * 3^4 = 5^5 * 3^4`. The odd prime factors are 3 and 5. Therefore, this curve has bad reduction at `p=3` and `p=5`.\n\n*   **B. z^2 = x^5 - 1:** The polynomial is `f(x) = x^5 - 1`. The discriminant is `(-1)^(10) * 5^5 * (-1)^4 = 5^5`. The odd prime factor is 5. So, the curve has bad reduction at `p=5`.\n\n*   **C. z^2 = x^6 - 1:** The polynomial is `f(x) = x^6 - 1`. The discriminant of `x^n - 1` is `(-1)^((n-1)(n-2)/2) * n^n`. For this curve, it is `(-1)^(10) * 6^6 = 2^6 * 3^6`. The odd prime factor is 3, leading to bad reduction at `p=3`.\n\n*   **D. z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1:** The polynomial is `f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1`. Calculating the discriminant for this polynomial yields `131072 = 2^17`. Since the only prime factor of the discriminant is 2, the curve has good reduction for all odd primes `p`.\n\n*   **E. z^2 = 4*x^5 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 4x + 4:** The polynomial is `f(x) = 4x^5 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x + 4`. Its discriminant is a large number with odd prime factors, including 3 and 26099. Thus, it has bad reduction at these odd primes.\n\nBased on the analysis of the discriminants, only the curve in option D has good reduction for all primes `p > 2`. For a curve to have good ordinary reduction, it must first have good reduction. Since options A, B, C, and E have bad reduction at some odd primes, they are disqualified. It is a known result in number theory that a hyperelliptic curve with good reduction at a prime `p` is \"usually\" ordinary; the primes where it is supersingular are less frequent. Given that only one option satisfies the condition of having good reduction for all primes above 2, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
