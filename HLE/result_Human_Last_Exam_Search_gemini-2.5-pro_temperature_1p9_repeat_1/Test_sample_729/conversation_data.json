    "A \"power subgroup\" of a group G is a subgroup H such that for some integer k, H is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G, denoted as `H = <g^k | g ∈ G>`. The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted by Q_128.\n\nThe structure of Q_128 is given by the presentation:\n`Q_128 = <x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)>`\n\nThe elements of Q_128 are of the form `x^i` or `x^i y` for `0 ≤ i < 64`. To find the power subgroups, we need to compute the subgroups generated by the k-th powers of these elements for various integers k.\n\nThe k-th powers of the elements are:\n*   `(x^i)^k = x^(ik)`\n*   `(x^i y)^k`\n\nA key property is that all elements outside the cyclic subgroup `<x>` have order 4. Their square is `(x^i y)^2 = x^32`.\n\nLet's analyze the subgroups generated by k-th powers, denoted as `G_k = <g^k | g ∈ Q_128>`:\n\n*   **For odd k:** The mapping `g -> g^k` is a bijection on any finite group of order `2^n`. Therefore, for any odd integer k, the set of k-th powers is the entire group `Q_128` itself. Thus, `G_k = Q_128` for all odd k. This gives us one power subgroup.\n\n*   **For even k:** Let `k = 2m`.\n    *   `(x^i)^(2m) = x^(2im)`\n    *   `(x^i y)^(2m) = ((x^i y)^2)^m = (x^32)^m = x^(32m)`\n    The subgroup `G_k = G_{2m}` is generated by the set of all such elements. This is equivalent to the subgroup generated by `<x^(2m)>` and `x^(32m)`. Since `x^(32m)` is a power of `x^(2m)`, the subgroup is simply `<x^(2m)>`. However, since `<x>` is a cyclic group of order 64, the distinct subgroups generated in this way are of the form `<x^d>` where `d` is a divisor of 64. The generating set for `G_{2m}` within `<x>` is `x^d` where `d=gcd(2m, 64)`.\n\nWe can categorize the power subgroups based on the highest power of 2 that divides k:\n\n*   **k is odd (v_2(k) = 0):** `G_k = Q_128`. (1st power subgroup)\n*   **k = 2 * (odd number) (v_2(k) = 1):** `G_k = <x^2>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 32. (2nd power subgroup)\n*   **k = 4 * (odd number) (v_2(k) = 2):** `G_k = <x^4>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 16. (3rd power subgroup)\n*   **k = 8 * (odd number) (v_2(k) = 3):** `G_k = <x^8>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 8. (4th power subgroup)\n*   **k = 16 * (odd number) (v_2(k) = 4):** `G_k = <x^{16}>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 4. (5th power subgroup)\n*   **k = 32 * (odd number) (v_2(k) = 5):** `G_k = <x^{32}>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 2. (6th power subgroup)\n*   **k is a multiple of 64 (v_2(k) ≥ 6):** `G_k = <x^{64}> = {1}`. This is the trivial subgroup. (7th power subgroup)\n\nThis analysis yields a complete list of distinct power subgroups. In total, there are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\nThe seven power subgroups are:\n1.  `Q_128`\n2.  `<x^2>` (order 32)\n3.  `<x^4>` (order 16)\n4.  `<x^8>` (order 8)\n5.  `<x^16>` (order 4)\n6.  `<x^32>` (order 2)\n7.  The trivial subgroup `{1}`\n\n<<<7>>>"
