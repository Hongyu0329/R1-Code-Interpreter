    "The search results confirm that for a continuous-time Markov chain, the limiting probabilities $P_j = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} P_{ij}(t)$ can be found by solving a system of linear equations derived from the Kolmogorov forward (or backward) equations. This is achieved by setting the derivatives of the probabilities to zero, which corresponds to finding the stationary distribution of the process. The system of equations is then solved along with the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities is equal to 1. My approach of setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all i is therefore correct.\n\nThe system of equations for the stationary probabilities $P_i$ is:\n1. $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n2. $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n3. $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}$\n4. $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n5. $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) P_2 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$\n\nSo, we have $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nNow, expressing all probabilities in terms of $P_1$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$\n$P_2 = P_1$\n$P_3 = P_1$\n\nSubstitute these into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$\\frac{650}{19} P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}) P_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} P_1 = 1 \\implies P_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nNow, calculate $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\nThe desired value is $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$.\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nThe calculation seems solid and the methodology is backed by the theory of continuous-time Markov chains and the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations. The final answer is the fraction 669/707.\n\nTo express this as a decimal:\n$669 \\div 707 \\approx 0.946251768175389$\n\nThe question does not specify the format, so the exact fraction is better.\n\nFinal answer seems to be $\\frac{669}{707}$.\nI am ready for the final answer.\nTo find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, which we denote as $P_i$, we set the derivatives in the Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations to zero. This is because, at equilibrium ($t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities are assumed to become constant.\n\nThe given system of differential equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) + 0.65 P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = 0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = 0.4 P_{1}(t) - (0.392  + 0.008)P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = 0.008 P_{2}(t) - 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\nAnd the normalization condition is:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nSetting the derivatives to zero gives the following system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$:\n1. $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n2. $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - 1.05 P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n3. $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - 0.4 P_{2}$\n4. $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n5. $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nFrom equation (3), we get:\n$0.4 P_{1} = 0.4 P_{2} \\implies P_{1} = P_{2}$\n\nFrom equation (4), we get:\n$0.008 P_{2} = 0.008 P_{3} \\implies P_{2} = P_{3}$\n\nCombining these results, we have $P_{1} = P_{2} = P_{3}$.\n\nFrom equation (1), we express $P_0$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$0.019 P_{0} = 0.65 P_{1} \\implies P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1} = \\frac{650}{19} P_{1}$\n\nNow we use the normalization condition (5) to solve for $P_1$. We substitute the expressions for $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{650}{19} P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right) P_{1} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}\\right) P_{1} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right) P_{1} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{707}{19} P_{1} = 1 \\implies P_{1} = \\frac{19}{707}\n$$\nNow we find $P_0$:\n$$\nP_{0} = \\frac{650}{19} P_{1} = \\frac{650}{19} \\left(\\frac{19}{707}\\right) = \\frac{650}{707}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which is $P_0 + P_1$:\n$$\nP_{0} + P_{1} = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}\n$$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$\n\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...\n$$\nThe exact fraction is $\\frac{669}{707}$.\n\n<<<669/707>>>"
