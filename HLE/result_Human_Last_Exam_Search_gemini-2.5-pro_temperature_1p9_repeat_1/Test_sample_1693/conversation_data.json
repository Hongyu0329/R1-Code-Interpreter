    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the submarine **Doris**.\n\nThe submarine *Doris* (Q135), a *Circé*-class coastal submarine, was sunk by the German U-boat U-9 on the night of May 8-9, 1940, off the Dutch coast. The *Doris* had a surfaced displacement of 615 tons and a submerged displacement of 776 tons.\n\nDuring the period between the start of World War II in September 1939 and the French armistice on June 22, 1940, which took effect on June 25, the *Doris* was the only French warship confirmed to have been sunk by a German U-boat. Other French naval losses during this time were attributed to other causes, such as mines, air attacks, or surface combat. For example, the destroyer *Jaguar* was torpedoed by German E-boats on May 23, 1940. The battleship *Bretagne*, a much larger vessel with a displacement of 22,189 tons, was sunk on July 3, 1940, after the armistice, by the British Royal Navy at Mers-el-Kébir.\n\n<<<Doris>>>"
