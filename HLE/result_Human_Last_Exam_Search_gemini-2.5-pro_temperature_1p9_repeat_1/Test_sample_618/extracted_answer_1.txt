The general representation for the Lie group transformation on the coordinate `x`, denoted by `x'`, is given by:

1.  For `c₁ ≠ 0`:
    `x'(ε) = x + c₂ε + (c₃/(k₁²c₁))(e^(k₁(t + c₁ε)) - e^(k₁t))`

2.  For `c₁ = 0`:
    `x'(ε) = x + ((c₃/k₁)e^(k₁t) + c₂)ε`

Here, `ε` is the group parameter, and `c₁`, `c₂`, `c₃` are arbitrary constants that define a specific element of the Lie group.
