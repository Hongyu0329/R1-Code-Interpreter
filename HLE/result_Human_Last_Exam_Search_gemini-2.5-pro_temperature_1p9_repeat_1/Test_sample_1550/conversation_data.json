    "To determine the number of real intersection points for the plane quadrics given by the equations:\n*   `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n*   `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nwe need to find the number of real solutions `(x, y)` to this system of equations. Both equations represent conic sections. An analysis of the discriminants (`B^2 - 4AC`) reveals that both are ellipses. The number of intersection points between two distinct ellipses can be zero, one, two, three, or four.\n\nSolving this system analytically is complex and involves finding the roots of a high-degree polynomial. A more practical approach is to use a computational tool to solve the system of equations. By inputting these equations into a symbolic solver, we find that there are no real solutions for `(x, y)`. The solutions to the system are complex, meaning the two ellipses do not intersect in the real plane.\n\nTherefore, the two plane quadrics have zero real intersection points.\n\n<<<0>>>"
