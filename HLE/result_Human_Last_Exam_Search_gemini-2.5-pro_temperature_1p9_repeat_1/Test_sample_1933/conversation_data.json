    "### VC Dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is 4\n\nThe Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the specified fragment of first-order logic, $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, is 4. This conclusion is based on the analysis of the expressive power of the logic and established results from computational learning theory.\n\n#### Analysis of the Logical Fragment\n\nThe logical fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows for formulas constructed using only existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the logical constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$). The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates, which can be denoted as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n\nA formula in this logic with one free variable, say $x$, defines a \"concept,\" which is a subset of the domain of a given model. Any such formula can be simplified. A generic formula $\\phi(x)$ has the form $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k . \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k)$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. This can be rewritten as a conjunction of atoms involving the free variable $x$ and a sentence (a formula with no free variables). This sentence is either true or false in a given model.\n*   If the sentence part is false, the entire formula is equivalent to $\\bot$, defining the empty set.\n*   If the sentence part is true, the formula is equivalent to the conjunction of atoms involving $x$.\n\nConsequently, any concept defined by this logic is either the empty set or is defined by a \"monotone monomial\" of the form $P_{i_1}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_k}(x)$. In any given model where the predicates $P_i$ are interpreted as sets $S_i$, these formulas define sets that are intersections of some of the sets $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$. The entire class of concepts is therefore the set of all possible intersections of these four base sets, also known as an intersection-closed class.\n\n#### Determining the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a concept class is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the class. A set of points is shattered if for every one of its subsets, there exists a concept in the class that isolates exactly that subset.\n\nFor a concept class formed by the intersections of $k$ base sets, it is a standard result in learning theory that the VC dimension is exactly $k$. In this problem, we have $k=4$ unary predicates, which correspond to 4 base sets in any given model.\n\nTo demonstrate that the VC dimension is at least 4, one can construct a model and a set of 4 points, $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$, that is shattered. This can be achieved by defining the interpretations of the predicates, $S_i$, on the set $X$ as $S_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$. For any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, the concept formed by intersecting the sets $S_j$ for all $x_j \\notin Y$ will select exactly the points in $Y$.\n\nThe fact that the VC dimension cannot exceed 4 is also a known result. Any set of $4+1=5$ points cannot be shattered by the intersections of 4 sets. This can be proven using principles from linear algebra (e.g., Radon's theorem) applied to vector representations of the points' classifications by the base sets.\n\nSince the VC dimension can be at most 4 for any model, and there exists a model where the VC dimension is at least 4, the VC dimension of the logical fragment is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
