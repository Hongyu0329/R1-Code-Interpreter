    "In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs can have various interpretations. A common one, often denoted by \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), is the graph join. The join of two graphs is formed by taking their disjoint union and adding all possible edges between the vertices of the two graphs.\n\nThe chromatic number of the join of two graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\n\\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\).\n\nThis can be extended to the sum of three graphs:\n\\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2 + G_3) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) + \\chi(G_3) \\).\n\nIn this problem, the graph \\( G \\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), which we can represent as \\( C_n \\). Therefore, \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\), and its chromatic number is:\n\\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd:\n*   If \\( n \\) is even (\\( n \\ge 4 \\)), the cycle is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\n*   If \\( n \\) is odd (\\( n \\ge 3 \\)), the cycle is not bipartite, and its chromatic number is 3.\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\), we need to maximize the chromatic number of \\( C_n \\). The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is an odd number.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is:\n\\( \\chi(G)_{\\text{max}} = 3 \\cdot \\max(\\chi(C_n)) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n\n<<<9>>>"
