    "When the complement protein C3 is broken down, it facilitates the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n\nThe breakdown of C3, a central component of the complement system, results in the generation of protein fragments, notably C3b and iC3b. These fragments then coat the surface of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in a process known as opsonization. This \"tagging\" of the amyloid plaques allows them to be recognized and cleared by phagocytic cells like macrophages and microglia, which have specific receptors for these complement fragments, such as complement receptor 1 (CR1) and complement receptor 3 (CR3).\n\nEssentially, the cleavage of C3 into C3b acts as a signal to the immune system, marking the amyloid deposits for destruction and removal. Studies have shown that a deficiency in complement C3 leads to an increase in the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. This underscores the crucial role of the complement system, and specifically the breakdown of C3, in mediating the clearance of amyloid by macrophages and other phagocytes.\n\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"
