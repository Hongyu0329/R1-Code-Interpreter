The critical amount of correlation, expressed as the covariance between the mean activities of the two input populations (`C_{vs}`), required to balance potentiation and depression is given by the expression: `C_{vs} = 2μ(θ - μ) - σ^2`, where `μ` is the average rate of activation for the inputs, `θ` is the heterosynaptic offset constant, and `σ^2` is the variance of the mean activity of an input population.
