    "While pinpointing the exact individual who held the position of judge (Hungarian: *bíró*, Slovak: *richtár*) of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the specific year of 1461 is not definitively established in readily available records, a prominent figure from that era is often mentioned.\n\n**Stenzl György (George Stenzl)** is referred to as the *városbíró* (town judge) under whose leadership the town hall was constructed at the beginning of the 15th century. This suggests he was a major political figure in Bártfa during the period of its greatest prosperity.\n\nIt is also documented that in 1461, a functioning town administration was in place. Records from that year indicate the existence of a body of \"lay judges,\" who were formally invited to participate in talks. This points to a system of shared governance. Furthermore, an incident involving a fire in 1461, after which the town council directed a chaplain to sue the responsible party, confirms the council's legal authority at the time.\n\nTherefore, while a single individual may have held the primary title of judge in 1461, the governance of Bártfa was likely a collective effort involving a head judge and a council. Given the records of his prominence in the first half of the 15th century, Stenzl György is a strong candidate for having been the judge or a leading member of the town's judiciary in 1461, although conclusive proof for that specific year is not available in the searched documents. For a definitive answer, the detailed town chronicles or archival records of Bardejov for that year would need to be consulted.\n\n<<<While a definitive name for the judge of Bártfa in 1461 is not explicitly stated in the available records, Stenzl György is a strong candidate for having held this position around that time, with the town's governance also involving a council of lay judges.>>>"
