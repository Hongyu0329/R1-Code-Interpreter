    "The haiku provides a series of clues pointing to a specific place. The title, \"The Bays,\" indicates that the answer is a list of bay names, which should be presented in alphabetical order.\n\nThe haiku reads:\n\n\"An August tempest\nTwice fifteen brings winds of change\nA divine one yields\"\n\nA detailed analysis of the clues suggests a connection to St. Vincent and the Grenadines:\n\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: \"Divine\" can be found in a shop name on St. Vincent, Divine SVG, which is described as a \"treasure trove of local culture and craftsmanship\". This suggests a \"divine\" connection to the island. Furthermore, many Caribbean islands are named after saints.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: This translates to the number 30. While a direct link to \"winds of change\" is subtle, the number 30 is significant in a few contexts related to St. Vincent. St. Vincent's Private Hospital has a 30-bay daycare ward. Additionally, a charity event called \"30 Bays in 30 Days\" takes place in the region, encouraging swimming in 30 different bays.\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: While not a literal tempest, the Caribbean setting is prone to tropical storms, particularly in August.\n\nGiven these clues, the most plausible answer is a list of bays in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Based on available information, here are some of the notable bays, presented in alphabetical order:\n\n<<<Admiralty Bay, Friendship Bay, Lower Bay, Salt Whistle Bay, Villa Beach>>>"
