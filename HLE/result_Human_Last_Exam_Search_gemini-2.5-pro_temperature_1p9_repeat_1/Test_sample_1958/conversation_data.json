    "The first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name or clear allusion in a Shakespearean play is **Genesis**. This occurs in the play ***1 Henry VI***.\n\nThe book of Genesis is the first book in the canonical order of the Old Testament. Shakespeare makes numerous references to the stories within Genesis, particularly the account of Cain and Abel. One of the earliest of Shakespeare's plays to contain such a reference is *1 Henry VI*. In Act 1, Scene 3, the Bishop of Winchester refers to the Duke of Gloucester as a \"cursed Cain\" in the line, \"This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain, To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.\"\n\nChronologically, *1 Henry VI* is considered one of Shakespeare's earliest works, with scholars dating its composition to approximately 1591–1592. While other plays also reference Genesis, such as *Richard II* and *Hamlet*, they were written later. For instance, *Richard II* dates to around 1595, and *Hamlet* to about 1599–1601.\n\nShakespeare also alludes to other early biblical books. For example, the story of Jephthah from the Book of Judges is mentioned in *Hamlet*. However, as Genesis precedes Judges in the canonical biblical order, the reference in *1 Henry VI* stands as the first.\n\n<<<Genesis, in the play *1 Henry VI*.>>>"
