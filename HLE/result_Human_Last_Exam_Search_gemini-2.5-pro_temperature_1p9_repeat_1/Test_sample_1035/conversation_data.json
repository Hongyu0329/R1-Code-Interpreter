    "The initial search has revealed two main theorems concerning the covering of a complete graph Kn with bipartite graphs.\n\nThe Graham-Pollak theorem states that the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs whose edges partition the edge set of Kn is n-1. This applies to an edge-disjoint decomposition.\n\nAnother theorem states that the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of Kn (where edges can be covered multiple times) is ⌈log₂(n)⌉.\n\nThe user's question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph Kn where n = 35\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could mean:\n1. The minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all edges of K35.\n2. The sum of vertices in each bipartite graph in a minimal covering family.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking for the minimum number of bipartite graphs, as this is a standard problem in graph theory. The term \"family of bipartite graphs\" refers to the set of bipartite graphs used for the covering. The \"minimum number of vertices\" could be interpreted as a misstatement of \"minimum number of bipartite graphs\". If it literally means the sum of vertices of the bipartite graphs, the problem is not well-defined without more constraints. Each bipartite graph in the cover is a subgraph of Kn, so its vertices are a subset of the n vertices of Kn.\n\nAssuming the question is asking for the minimum number of bipartite graphs:\n\n*   If the covering must be a **partition** (edge-disjoint), the Graham-Pollak theorem applies.\n*   If the covering can have **overlapping edges**, the `⌈log₂(n)⌉` formula applies.\n\nThe phrasing \"covering all the edges\" usually implies that edges can be covered more than once. If a partition was implied, the term \"partition\" or \"decomposition\" would typically be used. Therefore, the most likely interpretation is a covering, not a partition.\n\nLet's proceed with this assumption.\n\nTo find the minimum number of bipartite graphs to cover K35, I need to calculate ⌈log₂(35)⌉.\n\nI don't need further google searches to perform this calculation.\n\n2^5 = 32\n2^6 = 64\n\nTherefore, log₂(35) is between 5 and 6. The ceiling of this value is 6.\n\nSo, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all edges of K35 is 6.\n\nNow, I will re-read the question carefully: \"What is the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph Kn where n = 35?\"\n\nThe phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is the main source of ambiguity. Let's explore the alternative interpretation: what is the minimum total number of vertices in the graphs of the covering family?\n\nLet the family of bipartite graphs be G₁, G₂, ..., Gₖ. The question could be asking for the minimum value of Σ|V(Gᵢ)| for i=1 to k, where k is the size of a minimal covering.\n\nEach Gᵢ is a subgraph of Kₙ, so V(Gᵢ) is a subset of V(K_n). A bipartite graph must have at least two vertices to have an edge. The family of graphs must cover all edges of K₃₅.\n\nIf we take the minimal covering of k = ⌈log₂(35)⌉ = 6 bipartite graphs. Let these graphs be B₁, ..., B₆. Each Bᵢ = (Xᵢ, Yᵢ) where Xᵢ ∪ Yᵢ are subsets of the vertex set of K₃₅. To cover all edges, every vertex of K₃₅ must appear in at least one of these bipartite graphs. In the standard construction for the ⌈log₂(n)⌉ covering, each vertex is assigned a unique binary vector of length k. An edge {u, v} is in the i-th bipartite graph if the i-th coordinates of the vectors for u and v differ. In this construction, all n vertices of K₃₅ are used in defining each of the k bipartite graphs. Therefore, for each of the 6 bipartite graphs, all 35 vertices are involved. The sum of vertices would be 6 * 35 = 210.\n\nLet's consider the Graham-Pollak theorem construction, which gives a partition (a stronger condition than covering) into n-1=34 star graphs. A star graph K₁,ₙ-₁ has n vertices. If we use n-1 stars to partition the edges, for K₃₅, we would use 34 stars. The i-th star would be centered at vertex i and connect to all vertices with a higher index. The number of vertices in each star graph varies.  For example, K₁,₃₄, K₁,₃₃, ... K₁,₁.  The total number of vertices would be the sum of (34-i+2) for i from 1 to 34. This would be a large number.\n\nLet's stick with the most standard interpretation of the question which points to the number of graphs in the minimal covering. The phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" seems to be an awkward way of asking for the size of the family (the number of graphs). If it were asking for the sum of the orders of the graphs in the family, the question would be much more complex and less standard.\n\nLet's confirm the standard interpretation. The problem of covering a complete graph with bipartite graphs is a well-known problem, and the answer is indeed ⌈log₂(n)⌉. It's highly probable that this is what the question is asking for, despite the slightly unusual wording.\n\nLet me double-check the sources to see if there is any mention of minimizing the sum of vertices. The search results and which give the ⌈log₂(n)⌉ result discuss the \"number of bipartite graphs\" or the \"cardinality of minimum biclique cover\". The other results discuss partitions (the Graham-Pollak theorem). None of them seem to discuss minimizing the total number of vertices in the covering graphs. This reinforces the idea that the question is most likely asking for the number of bipartite graphs.\n\nLet's calculate the answer based on this understanding.\nn = 35\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover Kn is ⌈log₂(n)⌉.\nk = ⌈log₂(35)⌉\n2⁵ = 32\n2⁶ = 64\nSince 32 < 35 ≤ 64, we have log₂(32) < log₂(35) ≤ log₂(64), which means 5 < log₂(35) ≤ 6.\nTherefore, ⌈log₂(35)⌉ = 6.\n\nFinal check of the wording: \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs...\".\nCould this mean the size of the vertex set U V(Gi) over all Gi in the family?  If so, since all edges of Kn must be covered, every vertex of Kn must be part of at least one edge, so all n vertices of Kn must be included in the union of the vertex sets of the bipartite graphs. So the size of the union of the vertex sets is simply n=35.  This seems too simple.\n\nLet's reconsider Σ|V(Gᵢ)|. For the standard log₂(n) construction, all n vertices participate in each of the k bipartite graphs. So each has n vertices. The total is k*n = 6 * 35 = 210. Is there a different construction that uses fewer total vertices? This is a much harder, non-standard question. Given the context of typical math competition/textbook problems, the most probable interpretation is a slight misphrasing of the standard question.\n\nLet's consider if \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" could mean the number of vertices in the smallest graph in the family. This is also not a standard question and would depend heavily on the specific construction.\n\nGiven the standard results found, the question is almost certainly asking for the minimum number of bipartite graphs required for the covering. The most plausible interpretation is that \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is a convoluted or flawed way of asking \"minimum number of bipartite graphs in a family\".\n\nLet's assume the most standard interpretation and provide the answer.\n\nIf the question is about edge-disjoint partition:\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs to partition the edges of Kn is n-1. For n=35, this is 35-1=34. This is also known as the biclique partition number.\n\nIf the question is about covering (not necessarily edge-disjoint):\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs to cover the edges of Kn is ⌈log₂(n)⌉. For n=35, this is ⌈log₂(35)⌉ = 6.\n\nThe word \"covering\" usually implies non-disjoint. The word \"partition\" or \"decomposition\" implies disjoint. So, 6 is the more likely answer.\n\nLet's re-examine the phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\". What if \"family of bipartite graphs\" is a single entity? This makes no sense. The phrase \"a family of\" implies a collection.\n\nLet's assume the question is literally asking for the minimum of sum |V(G_i)| over all possible minimal coverings. This is a very unusual question. Let C = {G_1, ..., G_k} be a covering of K_n. We want to minimize Sum |V(G_i)|. The number k itself is not fixed, but we need enough graphs to cover all edges. Let's try a small example, say K₄. n=4. ⌈log₂(4)⌉=2. We need at least 2 bipartite graphs. Let's see the construction. Vertices {0,1,2,3}. Binary labels of length 2: 00, 01, 10, 11.\nG1: Edges between vertices where the first bit differs. { (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3) }. V(G1) = {0,1,2,3}\nG2: Edges between vertices where the second bit differs. { (0,1), (0,3), (2,1), (2,3) }. V(G2) = {0,1,2,3}.\nSum of vertices = 4+4=8. All edges are covered: (0,1) in G2, (0,2) in G1, (0,3) in both, (1,2) in G1, (1,3) in both, (2,3) in G2. Wait, the construction described in the search results is slightly different.\n\nLet Gᵢ be the graph where the bipartition is based on the i-th bit.\nFor K₄, vertices {0,1,2,3} assigned binary labels 00, 01, 10, 11.\nG₁: Partitions are {00, 01} and {10, 11}. So edges are {(0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3)}.\nG₂: Partitions are {00, 10} and {01, 11}. So edges are {(0,1), (0,3), (2,1), (2,3)}.\nThe edge (0,1) is in G₂, (0,2) in G₁, (0,3) in G₁ and G₂, (1,2) in G₁ and G₂, (1,3) in G₁, (2,3) in G₂. Not all edges are covered. Let me re-read the construction.\n\nThe construction: \"For i∈{1,2,…,⌈log₂n⌉} we define the t-th bipartite graph to contain the complete bipartite graph with vertex bipartition A∪B with A containing the vertices with t-th bit 1, and B containing the vertices with t-th bit 0. In this way, if vertices i and j disagree at the t-th bit, then the edge ij belongs to the t-th bipartite graph (and if i≠j, then they disagree at some bit).\"\nSo for K₄ and vertices v₀, v₁, v₂, v₃ labeled 00, 01, 10, 11:\nG₁: Bipartition A₁={v₂, v₃} (bit 1 is 1), B₁={v₀, v₁} (bit 1 is 0). Edges: (v₂,v₀), (v₂,v₁), (v₃,v₀), (v₃,v₁). Edges in K₄: (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1).\nG₂: Bipartition A₂={v₁, v₃} (bit 2 is 1), B₂={v₀, v₂} (bit 2 is 0). Edges: (v₁,v₀), (v₁,v₂), (v₃,v₀), (v₃,v₂). Edges in K₄: (1,0), (1,2), (3,0), (3,2).\nEdges covered:\nG₁: (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3)\nG₂: (0,1), (2,1), (0,3), (2,3)\nUnion: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). All 6 edges of K₄ are covered.\nIn this construction, |V(G₁)| = 4 and |V(G₂)| = 4. Sum = 8.\nFor this problem, with n=35, we need ⌈log₂(35)⌉ = 6 bipartite graphs. We assign distinct binary strings of length 6 to 35 of the vertices. Let the vertices be represented by numbers 0 to 34.\nG₁ has partition based on 1st bit. G₂ on 2nd, etc.\nFor each Gᵢ, the partition is V = Aᵢ U Bᵢ. To cover edges, we need Aᵢ and Bᵢ to be non-empty for each i. This is guaranteed as long as n>2. All 35 vertices are used in each Gᵢ, since each vertex has a label. So |V(Gᵢ)| = 35 for all i=1..6. Total sum = 6 * 35 = 210.\nCan we do better? Maybe with a different number of graphs? For K₄, we need at least 2.\nWhat about an edge-disjoint partition using Graham-Pollak? This requires n-1=3 graphs.\nOne such partition for K₄: Star graphs centered at 1, 2, 3.\nG₁ (star at v1): edges {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)}. V(G₁)=4\nG₂ (star at v2): edge {(2,3), (2,4)}. V(G₂)=3 (edges (2,1) is already in G1) No, the construction is partition of K4 into K1,3, K1,2, K1,1. Vertices {1,2,3,4}. G1 = K(1,{2,3,4}), G2=K(2,{3,4}), G3=K(3,{4}). The sum of vertices would be 4+3+2 = 9. This is for a partition. This is worse than 8 for a covering.\n\nThe wording of the question is the crux of the matter. Given the standard theorems in this area, the most likely intent of the question is to ask for the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover K_n. This number is a fundamental quantity in graph theory. The phrase \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" would then be interpreted as a misstatement for \"minimum number of graphs in a family of bipartite graphs\".\n\nLet's assume this is the case. The question then becomes \"What is the minimum number of bipartite graphs in a family covering all edges of K₃₅?\"\nThis is a standard problem. The answer is given by ⌈log₂(n)⌉.\nFor n = 35:\n⌈log₂(35)⌉.\nSince 2⁵ = 32 and 2⁶ = 64, we have 5 < log₂(35) < 6.\nSo, ⌈log₂(35)⌉ = 6.\n\nThere's a possibility that I am misinterpreting the question, but given the information from the search, this seems to be the most reasonable interpretation. The question of minimizing the sum of the number of vertices is not a standard one, and would likely not have a clean answer like this. It would depend on intricate constructions of bipartite subgraphs. I will proceed with the assumption that the question is asking for the number of graphs.<ctrl95>It appears there might be some ambiguity in the phrasing of your question, \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs.\" This could be interpreted in a few ways. The most common and standard interpretation in graph theory would be that the question is asking for the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\). Let's proceed with this understanding.\n\nA key result in graph theory addresses the problem of covering a complete graph with bipartite graphs. A theorem states that the minimum number of bipartite graphs whose edges cover the complete graph \\( K_n \\) is \\( \\lceil\\log_2 n\\rceil \\). This is sometimes referred to as the bipartite dimension of a complete graph.\n\nIn this scenario, we have a complete graph \\( K_{35} \\), which means n = 35. To find the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all of its edges, we need to calculate \\( \\lceil\\log_2 35\\rceil \\).\n\nLet's evaluate this:\n*   \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n*   \\( 2^6 = 64 \\)\n\nSince 35 is greater than 32 and less than or equal to 64, the logarithm of 35 to the base 2 is between 5 and 6. As we must take the ceiling of this value (the smallest integer greater than or equal to the value), we find:\n\n\\( \\lceil\\log_2 35\\rceil = 6 \\)\n\nTherefore, a minimum of 6 bipartite graphs is required to cover all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\).\n\nAlternatively, if the question refers to a partition of the edges (where each edge belongs to exactly one bipartite subgraph), the Graham-Pollak theorem would apply. This theorem states that the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs needed to partition the edges of \\( K_n \\) is n - 1. For \\( K_{35} \\), this would be 35 - 1 = 34. However, the term \"covering\" typically implies that edges can be included in more than one subgraph, making the former interpretation more likely.\n\nAssuming the standard interpretation of a covering problem, the answer is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
