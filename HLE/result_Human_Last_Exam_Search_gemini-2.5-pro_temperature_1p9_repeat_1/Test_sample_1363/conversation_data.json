    "It is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique in the **Viennese Waltz**.\n\nThe technique of the Viennese Waltz reverse turn is designed for linear movement down the long side of the ballroom. The combination of high speed and continuous, rapid rotation makes it technically very difficult to add rotation beyond what is prescribed.\n\nDance etiquette and standard practice on a crowded floor dictate that turns are not overturned to navigate corners. Instead of overturning a reverse turn, a dancer will typically change to a natural turn before a corner. Attempting to overturn a reverse turn to round a corner is considered \"extremely hard\" and not a feature of correct technique; for this reason, it's a move that is generally not executed by dancers.\n\nWhile other dances have specific amounts of turn for their reverse turns, the Viennese Waltz stands out due to the practical impossibility of overturning this figure while adhering to its fundamental principles of movement and floorcraft. In contrast, for instance, in the English Waltz, a dancer can intentionally overturn the last part of a reverse turn to change direction.\n\nFor these reasons, a disregard for the established technique is necessary to overturn a reverse turn in the Viennese Waltz.\n\n<<<A>>>"
