    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must first determine the length of each syllable and then group them into six metrical feet. Each foot is either a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, represented as D) or a spondee (two long syllables, represented as S).\n\nThe process involves identifying long vowels, diphthongs, and syllables made long by position (a vowel followed by two or more consonants). Elision, where a final vowel or a vowel followed by 'm' is dropped before a word starting with a vowel or 'h', must also be considered.\n\nThe line is: **verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.**\n\nThis particular line from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura* (Book 4, Line 733) is known for its metrical difficulties, particularly in the first half. A standard scansion requires applying some less common poetic licenses. However, a plausible reading can be achieved by carefully analyzing the syllables.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  **vē-r(um)ŭ-bĭ**: The first foot is a **dactyl**. The initial syllable `vēr-` is long by position (the vowel `e` is followed by `r` and `m`). The `-um` of `verum` elides with the following `u` of `ubi`. The `u` and `i` of `ubi` are both short.\n\n2.  **ē-qu(ī)āt-**: The second foot is a **spondee**. This requires poetic license. The `-i` of `ubi` does not elide with the `e` of `equi` (hiatus). The initial `e-` of `equi`, though naturally short, is lengthened by the metrical stress (ictus). The final `-i` of `equi` elides with the `a-` of `atque`. The syllable `āt-` is long by position (vowel `a` followed by `tq`).\n\n3.  **qu(e)hŏ-mĭ-nīs**: The third foot is a **dactyl**. The `-que` of `atque` elides with the `h-` of `hominis`. The first two syllables of `hominis`, `ho-` and `mi-`, are short. The final syllable, `-nis`, is long by position because it is followed by the two consonants `c` and `s` from `casu`.\n\n4.  **cā-sū**: The fourth foot is a **spondee**. The word `casu` is in the ablative singular, where both the `-a` and `-u` are long by nature.\n\n5.  **cōn-vē-nĭt**: The fifth foot is a **dactyl**. The syllable `cōn-` is long by position. The syllable `vē-` in the perfect tense verb `convēnit` contains a naturally long vowel. The final syllable `-nit` is short.\n\n6.  **ĭ-mā-gō**: The sixth and final foot is a **spondee**. The first two syllables of `imago` are short. However, in this position, to complete the meter, the final syllable is always treated as long. The foot is scanned as a spondee. A final foot can also be a trochee (long-short), but for the D/S representation, it resolves to a spondee.\n\nCombining these feet gives the following scansion:\n\n**D - S - D - S - D - S**\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
