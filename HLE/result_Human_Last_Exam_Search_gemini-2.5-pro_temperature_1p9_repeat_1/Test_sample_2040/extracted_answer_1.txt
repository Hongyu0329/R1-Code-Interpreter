Yes, under specific conditions related to their crystal structure. Rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN), a type of boron nanosheet, has been experimentally shown to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion due to its non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which is a key requirement for this second-order nonlinear optical process. Other forms, like borophene, are also theoretically expected to be capable of it, while common hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is less suitable unless in monolayer form.
