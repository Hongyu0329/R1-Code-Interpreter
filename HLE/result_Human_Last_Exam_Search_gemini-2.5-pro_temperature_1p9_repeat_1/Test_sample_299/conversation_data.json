    "There are no continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nTo prove this, let's assume such a function $f$ exists.\n\n1.  **Injectivity and Monotonicity:**\n    If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f$ is an injective function. A continuous injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n2.  **Commutativity with the exponential function:**\n    The given equation is $f(f(x)) = e^x$. If we apply $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(f(x))) = f(e^x)$.\n    Since function composition is associative, we can also write the left side as $f(f(f(x)))$. By substituting $f(x)$ for $x$ in the original equation, we get $f(f(f(x))) = e^{f(x)}$.\n    Therefore, we must have $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means the function $f$ commutes with the exponential function.\n\n3.  **Analysis of monotonic cases:**\n\n    *   **Case 1: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n        If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$. If we apply $f$ again, $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} < e^{x_2}$. This is consistent, as the exponential function is also strictly increasing.\n\n    *   **Case 2: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n        If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} < e^{x_2}$. This is also consistent.\n\n4.  **Deriving a contradiction.**\n    From the property $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$, it follows by induction that $f$ also commutes with the iterated exponential function. Let $g_n(x)$ be the $n$-th iteration of the exponential function, i.e., $g_1(x) = e^x$, and $g_{n+1}(x) = e^{g_n(x)}$. Then $f(g_n(x)) = g_n(f(x))$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\n    Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, there must exist a point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. To show this, let's consider the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. The range of $f(f(x)) = e^x$ is $(0, \\infty)$, which implies that the range of $f$ must be an interval contained in the domain of $f$, which is $\\mathbb{R}$. However, the range of the outer $f$ must be $(0,\\infty)$. Let the range of $f$ be $I$. Then $f(I)=(0,\\infty)$. If $f$ is increasing, then $I=(a, \\infty)$ where $a\\ge-\\infty$, and $f(a)=0$. We have $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = a$, so $f(f(x))\\to f(a)=0$ as $x\\to-\\infty$, which is consistent with $e^x\\to 0$. We can show there must be a fixed point. If $f(x)>x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) > f(x) > x$, but $e^x$ is not always greater than $x$. If $f(x)<x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$, which is also not always true for $e^x$. So $h(x)=f(x)-x$ must have a zero.\n\n    Let $x_0$ be a fixed point of $f$, so $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    Using the original equation, we have $f(f(x_0)) = e^{x_0}$.\n    Since $f(x_0) = x_0$, we also have $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    Therefore, $x_0$ must satisfy the equation $x_0 = e^{x_0}$.\n\n    However, there is no real number $x$ for which $x = e^x$. This can be seen by considering the function $g(x) = e^x - x$. Its derivative is $g'(x) = e^x - 1$, which is zero only at $x=0$. The minimum value of $g(x)$ occurs at $x=0$, where $g(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. Since the minimum value of $g(x)$ is 1, it is never zero. Thus, the equation $e^x - x = 0$ has no real solutions.\n\nThe assumption that a continuous function $f$ satisfying the given conditions exists leads to the conclusion that the equation $x = e^x$ must have a real solution. Since it does not, our initial assumption must be false.\n\nTherefore, the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the empty set. The cardinality of the empty set is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
