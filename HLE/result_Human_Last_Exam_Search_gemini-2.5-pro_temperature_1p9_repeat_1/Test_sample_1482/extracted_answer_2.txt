In the context of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs) using Gaussian paradigms, the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections for a fixed primary input variable `x'` and a secondary input variable `u` is defined by an Interval Type-2 Membership Function (IT2 MF). This IT2 MF is bounded by an Upper Membership Function (UMF) and a Lower Membership Function (LMF).

The general form of these bounds is given by:
*   **Upper Membership Function (UMF):** `μ_U(x', u) = exp(-1/2 * ((u - c(x')) / σ̄(x'))^2)`
*   **Lower Membership Function (LMF):** `μ_L(x', u) = λ * exp(-1/2 * ((u - c(x')) / σ̲(x'))^2)`

Where:
*   `x'` is the fixed value of the primary input variable.
*   `u` is the secondary input variable.
*   `c(x')` represents the mean of the Gaussian functions, which can be a function of `x'`.
*   `σ̄(x')` is the upper bound of the standard deviation at `x'`.
*   `σ̲(x')` is the lower bound of the standard deviation at `x'`.
*   `λ` is a scaling factor for the lower bound, where `0 ≤ λ ≤ 1`.

The interval `[μ_L(x', u), μ_U(x', u)]` defines the membership grade for `u` in the vertical cross-section at `x'`, thereby characterizing the uncertainty bounds.
