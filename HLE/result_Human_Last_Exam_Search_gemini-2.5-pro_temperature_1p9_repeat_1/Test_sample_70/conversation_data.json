    "To identify which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first determine the rank of the Danish flag and then analyze the flags of African nations based on the same principle.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns). For a flag, we can imagine it as a matrix of colored cells. The \"maximal rank\" is achieved by choosing scalar values for each color in such a way that the number of linearly independent rows is maximized.\n\n### Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe Danish flag, known as the Dannebrog, consists of a red field with a white, off-center Nordic cross. This design creates two distinct patterns for the rows of its corresponding matrix:\n1.  Rows that are part of the horizontal white stripe. These rows consist of a single color (white).\n2.  Rows that are not part of the horizontal stripe. These rows are composed of the background color (red) interrupted by the vertical white stripe.\n\nIf we assign distinct non-zero scalar values to red and white, these two types of rows will be linearly independent. Any other row in the flag will be identical to one of these two types. Therefore, the vector space spanned by the rows has a dimension of two. The maximal linear algebraic rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Flags of African Nations with Rank 2\n\nWe now seek African flags whose geometric design also results in a maximum of two linearly independent row patterns. This typically occurs in a few structural patterns:\n\n*   **Horizontal Bicolour with a Central Emblem:** A flag with two horizontal stripes and a central emblem. The rows without the emblem would be linearly dependent (both being solid-colored rows), while the rows containing parts of the emblem against the two different background colors create two new, linearly independent patterns. The set of all row vectors in such a flag spans a two-dimensional space.\n    *   **Angola:** The flag has horizontal red and black stripes with a central yellow emblem. This structure fits the pattern, resulting in a rank of 2.\n    *   **Burkina Faso:** This flag features horizontal red and green stripes with a central yellow star, giving it a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Triangle at the Hoist Modifying Horizontal Stripes:** A flag with multiple horizontal stripes where a triangle at the hoist imposes its color over the beginning of each row. Each row vector is a combination of the triangle's color and one of the stripe's colors. All such row vectors can be constructed from two basis vectors, leading to a rank of 2.\n    *   **Comoros:** Features four horizontal stripes and a green triangle at the hoist.\n    *   **Djibouti:** Has two horizontal stripes with a white triangle at the hoist.\n    *   **Equatorial Guinea:** Composed of three horizontal stripes with a blue triangle at the hoist.\n    *   **Mozambique:** Consists of several horizontal stripes with a red triangle at the hoist containing an emblem.\n    *   **South Sudan:** A multi-striped flag with a blue triangle at the hoist.\n    *   **Zimbabwe:** Features seven horizontal stripes with a white triangle at the hoist containing an emblem.\n\n*   **Vertical Stripe Modifying Horizontal Stripes:** A design with a vertical band at the hoist followed by horizontal stripes. This creates a different linearly independent row for each horizontal stripe color, as it is prepended by the color of the vertical band.\n    *   **Benin:** A vertical green stripe is followed by horizontal yellow and red stripes, resulting in two distinct row patterns and thus a rank of 2.\n    *   **Guinea-Bissau:** Similar to Benin, with a vertical red stripe (containing a black star) and horizontal yellow and green stripes. This structure also results in a rank of 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, the flags of the following African nations have the same linear algebraic rank (2) as the flag of Denmark:\n*   Angola\n*   Benin\n*   Burkina Faso\n*   Comoros\n*   Djibouti\n*   Equatorial Guinea\n*   Guinea-Bissau\n*   Mozambique\n*   South Sudan\n*   Zimbabwe\n\n<<<Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Comoros, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, South Sudan, Zimbabwe>>>"
