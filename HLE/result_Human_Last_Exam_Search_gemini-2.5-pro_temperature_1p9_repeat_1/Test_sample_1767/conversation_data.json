    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single topological system. The Chern number of this combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components. This is due to the additive nature of the Chern number as a topological invariant.\n\nFor instance, stacking multiple layers of Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, results in a system with a total Chern number equal to the number of layers. While the query specifies a lateral junction, the principle of additivity still applies when the insulators are strongly coupled to form one system.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers: C_total = C1 + C2 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the number of chiral edge states at the interface between the two regions is determined by the difference in their Chern numbers, which in this case is |1 - 1| = 0. This means that while the overall system has a Chern number of 2 and will exhibit two chiral edge states on its outer boundaries, there are no additional conducting states localized at the junction between the two C=1 regions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
