    "A finite group G is termed a \"filled group\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G is also a complete set, meaning the set and its products cover all non-identity elements of the group. The classification of finite filled nilpotent groups distinguishes between abelian and non-abelian cases.\n\nA finite abelian group is a filled group if and only if it is isomorphic to one of the following:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3, denoted as C3.\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted as C5.\n*   An elementary abelian 2-group, which is a group of the form (C2)^n for some integer n.\n\nFor non-abelian finite nilpotent groups, the classification is more intricate. A key result from the paper \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\" is that the only filled dihedral groups, which are a specific type of non-abelian nilpotent group for orders that are a power of 2, are D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, and D22. The research within this paper provides a broader classification for all finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\nA non-abelian finite group that is a p-group (a group where the order of every element is a power of a prime p) is a filled group only if it is a 2-group. Further research has shown that the only non-abelian filled nilpotent groups are certain 2-groups.\n\nTherefore, the complete classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is as follows:\n*   **Abelian case:** The cyclic groups C3 and C5, and the elementary abelian 2-groups.\n*   **Non-abelian case:** A limited number of 2-groups, which includes the dihedral groups D8 and D12 (D6 is isomorphic to S3 which is not nilpotent, D10 is not a p-group, D14 is not a p-group, and D22 is not a p-group, so from the list of filled dihedral groups only D8 and D12 are nilpotent 2-groups) and other specific non-abelian 2-groups.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if it is one of the following:\n1.  An elementary abelian 2-group.\n2.  The cyclic group of order 3, C3.\n3.  The cyclic group of order 5, C5.\n4.  The dihedral group of order 8, D8.\n5.  The quaternion group of order 8, Q8.>>>"
