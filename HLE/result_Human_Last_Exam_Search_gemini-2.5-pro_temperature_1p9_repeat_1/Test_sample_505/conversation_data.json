    "### A maximum of 4 logical qubits can be encoded.\n\nIn the realm of quantum computing, surface codes are a leading method for correcting quantum errors. A standard, simple patch of surface code without any modifications typically encodes a single logical qubit. To increase the number of logical qubits that can be stored, \"holes\" or \"defects\" are intentionally introduced into the surface code patch.\n\nThe number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a patch is directly related to the number of these holes. For a planar surface code, which can be visualized as a flat sheet, the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to the number of holes it contains. Specifically, a surface code with 'b' holes can encode 'b' logical qubits. This has been illustrated in designs showing that a surface code with two closed holes encodes two logical qubits.\n\nThe problem specifies two separate patches of surface code, with each patch containing two holes. Applying the established principle:\n\n*   **For the first patch:** With two holes, it can encode two logical qubits.\n*   **For the second patch:** Similarly, with two holes, it can also encode two logical qubits.\n\nSince the two patches are distinct, the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded is the sum of the qubits from each patch. Therefore, the total is 2 + 2 = 4 logical qubits. While these patches could be brought together to perform operations through a process called \"lattice surgery,\" for the purpose of encoding information, their capacities are additive.\n\n<<<4>>>"
