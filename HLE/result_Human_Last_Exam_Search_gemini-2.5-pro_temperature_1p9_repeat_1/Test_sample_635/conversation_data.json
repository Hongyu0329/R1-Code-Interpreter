    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwe are looking for polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ such that $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, and $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nThe equation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is equivalent to $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. For $D(s)$ to be a valid matrix in this context, its elements must be polynomials in $s$.\nThen, $N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its entries must be polynomials.\nFrom the second column of $N(s)$, we can see that $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n\nNow consider the first column of $N(s)$. The common denominator of the terms is $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$.\nSo, for the entries in the first column to be polynomials, the following conditions must hold:\n1.  $d_{11}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This means $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n2.  $d_{21}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This means $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n\nWe need to find the simplest polynomial entries for $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions.\n\nLet's work on the first row of $D(s)$. A simple choice to handle the denominators is to make one of the terms zero. Let's try $d_{12}(s)=0$. Then, $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2$ must be divisible by $(s-1)(s+1)$. This implies that $d_{11}(s)(s-1)$ must be divisible by $(s+1)$. Since $(s-1)$ and $(s+1)$ are coprime polynomials, $d_{11}(s)$ must be divisible by $(s+1)$. The simplest non-trivial choice is $d_{11}(s) = s+1$.\nWith this choice, the first row of $D(s)$ is $[s+1 \\quad 0]$.\nThe corresponding first row of $N(s)$ becomes:\n$N_{11}(s) = \\frac{(s+1)(s-1)^2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s+1)(s-1)(s-1)}{(s+1)(s-1)} = s-1$\n$N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = s+1$\nSo, the first row of $N(s)$ is $[s-1 \\quad s+1]$.\n\nNow, let's work on the second row. We need to choose polynomials $d_{21}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$ such that $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ is divisible by $s^2-1$.\nLet's try a simple choice, for instance, let $d_{21}(s)$ be a constant, say $d_{21}(s) = -2$.\nThen, the condition becomes that $-2(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$. This is equivalent to $- (s-1)^2 + d_{22}(s)$ being divisible by $s^2-1$.\nFor this to hold, the expression must be zero at the roots of $s^2-1$, i.e., at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\nAt $s=1$: $-(1-1)^2 + d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$. So, $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor $(s-1)$.\nAt $s=-1$: $-(-1-1)^2 + d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies -4 + d_{22}(-1)=0 \\implies d_{22}(-1)=4$.\nLet's assume the simplest polynomial form for $d_{22}(s)$ satisfying these conditions: $d_{22}(s)=k(s-1)$. Then $d_{22}(-1)=k(-1-1) = -2k = 4$, which implies $k=-2$.\nSo, let's choose $d_{22}(s)=-2(s-1) = -2s+2$.\nWith this choice, the second row of $D(s)$ is $[-2 \\quad -2(s-1)]$.\nLet's verify: $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s) = -2(s-1)^2 + 2(-2(s-1)) = -2(s-1)[(s-1)+2] = -2(s-1)(s+1) = -2(s^2-1)$. This is divisible by $s^2-1$.\nThe corresponding second row of $N(s)$ is:\n$N_{21}(s) = \\frac{-2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} = -2$\n$N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = -2$\nSo, the second row of $N(s)$ is $[-2 \\quad -2]$.\n\nWe have found a candidate pair of matrices:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ -2 & -2s+2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ -2 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe final step is to check if these matrices are left coprime. Two polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the rank of the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is equal to the number of rows for all complex values of $s$.\nIn our case, the composite matrix is:\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ -2 & -2(s-1) & -2 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank of this 2x4 matrix is 2, unless all its 2x2 minors are zero. Let's compute the determinant of the minor formed by the last two columns (the columns of $N(s)$):\n\\[\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ -2 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = -2(s-1) - (-2)(s+1) = -2s+2+2s+2 = 4\n\\]\nSince this determinant is a non-zero constant (4), the rank of the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all finite values of $s$. Therefore, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nThe left coprime factorization is given by $H(s)=D(s)^{-1}N(s)$ where:\n\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ -2 & -2s+2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ -2 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n<<<\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ -2 & -2s+2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ -2 & -2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n>>>"
