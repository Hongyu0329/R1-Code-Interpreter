**Initial Trimethylation and Gene Expression Impact**

Based on the calculations:
*   The initial percentage of H3K4me3 sites at the beginning of the period was **30%**.
*   With the proportion of H3K4me3 sites decreasing by 10% over 10 hours, the target gene expression level is reduced to **180 RPKM**.
