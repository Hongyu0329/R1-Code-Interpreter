    "While there are several online video clips and references to Natalia Osipova's performance as Kitri in the *Don Quixote* production in Novosibirsk, Siberia in 2008, a complete and clear video of the Act I variation is unavailable. The existing footage is either fragmentary, of low resolution, or presented in playlists with broken links, making a precise count of her single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position impossible.\n\nMentions of this guest performance by Osipova, then a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, confirm it took place. However, without a continuous and high-quality recording of the specific variation, a definitive number cannot be provided. There is also a reference to a performance in Brazil in the same year, but similarly, a usable video for counting the pirouettes is not available.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number due to the lack of a complete and clear video of the performance.>>>"
