    "The first violin section in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\" concludes the piece by playing a three-note chord. The lowest note of this final chord is B-flat.\n\nThe symphony, composed in 1865, is in the key of B-flat major. The ending of the final movement, \"Allegro con fuoco,\" reinforces this home key. An analysis of the symphony's score, available through the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP), reveals that in the concluding bars, the first violins play a sustained B-flat major chord. The notes that comprise this chord for the first violin section are B-flat, D, and F. Of these three, the B-flat is the lowest pitch.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
