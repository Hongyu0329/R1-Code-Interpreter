The ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize catalytic performance is reaction-dependent. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a lower nickel content is generally favored, with studies pointing to an optimum around 7% molar Ni. For water splitting, a higher nickel content is more beneficial, with optimal atomic ratios of Ni to Ce being reported as 3:1 and 1:1 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and a 1:2 ratio for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in some catalyst systems.
