A single-site catalyst composed of a Zirconium (Zr) or Hafnium (Hf) metal center supported on highly Brønsted acidic sulfated alumina (AlS), generated from a simple organometallic precursor like Zr(Neopentyl)₄, represents the optimal combination. This system can efficiently polymerize olefins under moderate, hydrogen-free conditions and can be switched to effectively break down polyolefins into short, saturated alkanes under elevated temperature and hydrogen pressure.
