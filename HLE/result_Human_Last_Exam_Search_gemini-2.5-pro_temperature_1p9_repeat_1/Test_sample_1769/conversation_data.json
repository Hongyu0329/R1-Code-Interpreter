    "Without the Scandinavian influence that followed the Norse invasions between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster** or **swester**. This is because the native Old English word would have followed a different evolutionary path.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is a hybrid. It originates from Old English, where the terms were *sweostor* or, in the West Saxon and Mercian dialects, *swuster*. However, the distinctive \"i\" vowel in today's word was directly introduced from the Old Norse cognate, *systir*. In an alternate history without this linguistic exchange, the word's development would have relied solely on its Anglo-Saxon roots.\n\nThere are two primary evolutionary paths the word could have taken:\n\n1.  **From *swuster***: This was a common form in Old English, particularly in the dialects that most influenced the development of Standard English. In Middle English, this form became *suster*, a spelling frequently used by writers like Chaucer. Without the influence of the Norse *systir* to shift the vowel, *suster* is the most probable form that would have been passed down into Modern English. It would be a direct relative of the Dutch *zuster* and German *Schwester*.\n\n2.  **From *sweostor***: The Old English diphthong \"eo\" in *sweostor* typically evolved into an \"e\" sound in Middle English. A parallel example is the Old English *heorte*, which became *herte* in Middle English before evolving into the modern \"heart\". Following this pattern, *sweostor* would likely have become *swester*.\n\nOf the two possibilities, **suster** is the stronger candidate. Its prevalence in Middle English texts shows it was a dominant form before the Norse-influenced \"sister\" became standard. Therefore, had the Norse never interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, English speakers today would almost certainly refer to their female siblings as their \"suster\".\n\n<<<suster"
