    "Near four dimensions, in the context of the ϕ⁴ theory, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* is determined by the one-loop beta function in d = 4 - ε dimensions.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling constant *g* in the O(N)-symmetric ϕ⁴ theory (where the interaction term in the Lagrangian is often written as (g/4!) (φ²)²) is:\n\nβ(g) = -εg + [(N+8) / (8π²)] g² + O(g³)\n\nA fixed point g* is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling does not change with the energy scale. Setting the beta function to zero (β(g*) = 0) yields two solutions. One is the trivial Gaussian fixed point at g* = 0. The other is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point:\n\n-εg* + [(N+8) / (8π²)] (g*)² = 0\n\nSolving for a non-zero g* gives the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling:\n\ng* = [8π² / (N+8)] ε\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of ε.\n\nFor a single-component scalar field (N=1), the expression is:\n\ng* = (8π²/9) ε\n\nIt is also common to define a rescaled coupling, for instance u = g / (8π²). In this convention, the beta function is β(u) = -εu + (N+8)u², and the fixed point is:\n\nu* = ε / (N+8)\n\nSo, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in terms of ε is directly proportional to ε. The precise constant of proportionality depends on the normalization of the coupling constant. For the standard O(N) model, the value is:\n\n<<<u* = ε / (N+8)>>>"
