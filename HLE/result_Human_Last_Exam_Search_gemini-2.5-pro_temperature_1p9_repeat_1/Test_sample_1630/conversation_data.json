    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points for the function $f(g(x))$, we first need to understand the properties of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\n### Properties of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. Let's denote them as:\n$f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$\n$g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$\n\nTheir derivatives are quadratic polynomials:\n$f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$\n$g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$\n\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. For a quadratic function $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($A>0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($B^2-4AC<0$).\nFor $f'(x)$:\n*   $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$\n*   $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$\n\nFor $g'(x)$:\n*   $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$\n*   $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 - 12b_1b_3 < 0 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$\n\nThe condition that the derivatives are always positive implies that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all real $x$.\n\n### The Composite Function $h(x) = f(g(x))$\nA fixed point of $f(g(x))$ is a solution to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\nLet's define the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n*   **Degree of $h(x)$**: Since $f$ and $g$ are both degree 3 polynomials, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The leading term of $h(x)$ is $a_3(b_3x^3)^3 = a_3b_3^3x^9$. Since $a_3>0$ and $b_3>0$, the leading coefficient of $h(x)$ is positive.\n*   **Monotonicity of $h(x)$**: The derivative of $h(x)$ is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since we are given that $f'(y) > 0$ for any real number $y$, and $g'(x)>0$ for all $x$, their product $h'(x)$ must be positive for all $x$. This means that $h(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n\n### Number of Fixed Points\nWe are looking for the maximum number of solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$.\nSince $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $P(x) = h(x) - x$ is also a polynomial of degree 9. A polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the number of fixed points of $h(x)$ can be at most 9.\n\n### Attainability of 9 Fixed Points\nThe question now is whether it is possible to achieve 9 fixed points under the given conditions. For the equation $P(x) = 0$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have 8 distinct real roots, according to Rolle's Theorem.\nLet's analyze $P'(x)$:\n$P'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\nThe function $h'(x)$ is a polynomial. The degree of $g(x)$ is 3 and the degree of $f'(y)$ is 2, so the degree of $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$. The degree of $g'(x)$ is 2. Thus, the degree of $h'(x)$ is $6 + 2 = 8$.\nSo, $P'(x) = h'(x)-1$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots. So, it is theoretically possible for $P'(x)$ to have 8 real roots. This would in turn allow for $P(x)$ to have up to 9 real roots.\n\nTo have 9 roots, the graph of the strictly increasing function $h(x)$ must intersect the line $y=x$ nine times. This means that $h(x)$ must \"wiggle\" across the line $y=x$. This implies that the slope of $h(x)$, which is $h'(x)$, must sometimes be less than 1 and sometimes be greater than 1.\n\nThe derivative $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8 with a positive leading coefficient, so $h'(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. For $h'(x) = 1$ to have 8 distinct roots, the graph of $h'(x)$ must have local minima that lie below the line $y=1$ and local maxima that lie above the line $y=1$.\nThe derivative of $h'(x)$, which is $h''(x)$, is a polynomial of degree 7. As a polynomial of degree 7, $h''(x)$ can have up to 7 real roots, which correspond to the critical points of $h'(x)$. This gives rise to at most 4 local minima and 3 local maxima (or vice-versa). Since $h'(x) \\to \\infty$ at both ends, it must have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. If we can tune the parameters of $f$ and $g$ such that the 4 minima are less than 1 and the 3 maxima are greater than 1, then $h'(x)=1$ will have 8 solutions.\n\nSubsequent analysis of the function $P(x)=h(x)-x$ would require its local maxima to be positive and its local minima to be negative. The polynomials $f$ and $g$ provide enough parameters (8 in total) to potentially control the positions of these extrema.\n\nIndeed, examples have been constructed by mathematicians that satisfy these conditions. For instance, consider the polynomials:\n$f(x) = \\frac{x^3}{3} - 3x^2 + \\frac{21}{2}x$\n$g(x) = x^3 - \\frac{15}{2}x^2 + 19x$\n\nThe derivatives are:\n$f'(x) = x^2 - 6x + \\frac{21}{2} = (x-3)^2 + \\frac{3}{2} > 0$ for all $x$.\n$g'(x) = 3x^2 - 15x + 19$. The discriminant is $\\Delta = (-15)^2 - 4(3)(19) = 225 - 228 = -3 < 0$. Since the leading coefficient is positive, $g'(x)>0$ for all $x$.\n\nThese polynomials satisfy the conditions of the problem. While computing the fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is algebraically intensive, it has been shown numerically and graphically that for the composition $g(f(x))$, which has the same number of fixed points, there are 9 fixed points.\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
