    "A closed form for the given sum can be found using the method of generating functions.\n\nThe sum in question is $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$.\nThis can be recognized as the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of two generating functions, a form known as a convolution.\n\nLet $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum is the coefficient $[x^n]$ in the product of their respective ordinary generating functions, $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k x^k$ and $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_k x^k$.\n\nThe generating function for the central binomial coefficients is well-known:\n$B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$\n\nThe generating function $A(x)$ can be derived from $B(x)$. Let $\\theta = x \\frac{d}{dx}$ be the Euler operator. Then $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(k) c_k x^k = P(\\theta) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k x^k$. In our case, $A(x) = (2\\theta+1)^5 B(x)$.\nLet's define a sequence of functions $C_m(x) = (2\\theta+1)^m B(x)$.\n$C_0(x) = B(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$.\n$C_1(x) = (2\\theta+1) (1-4x)^{-1/2} = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$.\n$C_2(x) = (2\\theta+1) (1-4x)^{-3/2} = (8x+1)(1-4x)^{-5/2}$.\nIn general, one can find a recurrence relation for the polynomials $P_m(x)$ where $C_m(x) = P_m(x)(1-4x)^{-(2m+1)/2}$.\nContinuing this process up to $m=5$, we find:\n$C_5(x) = (4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1) (1-4x)^{-11/2}$.\n\nThe sum we are looking for is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product $A(x)B(x) = C_5(x)C_0(x)$.\n$S_n = [x^n] \\left( (4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1) (1-4x)^{-11/2} \\cdot (1-4x)^{-1/2} \\right)$\n$S_n = [x^n] (4096x^4 + 18944x^3 + 8256x^2 + 464x + 1) (1-4x)^{-6}$.\n\nTo find this coefficient, we use the generalized binomial theorem, $[x^k](1-z)^{-m} = \\binom{k+m-1}{m-1}z^k$.\nFor $(1-4x)^{-6}$, the coefficient of $x^j$ is $\\binom{j+6-1}{6-1}4^j = \\binom{j+5}{5}4^j$.\nWe need to find the coefficient of $x^n$ in the full expression:\n$S_n = 4096 [x^{n-4}](1-4x)^{-6} + 18944 [x^{n-3}](1-4x)^{-6} + 8256 [x^{n-2}](1-4x)^{-6} + 464 [x^{n-1}](1-4x)^{-6} + [x^n](1-4x)^{-6}$.\n$S_n = 4096 \\binom{n+1}{5}4^{n-4} + 18944 \\binom{n+2}{5}4^{n-3} + 8256 \\binom{n+3}{5}4^{n-2} + 464 \\binom{n+4}{5}4^{n-1} + \\binom{n+5}{5}4^{n}$.\n\nDividing by the common factor $4^n$, we get:\n$S_n = 4^n \\left( \\frac{4096}{4^4}\\binom{n+1}{5} + \\frac{18944}{4^3}\\binom{n+2}{5} + \\frac{8256}{4^2}\\binom{n+3}{5} + \\frac{464}{4}\\binom{n+4}{5} + \\binom{n+5}{5} \\right)$.\n\nThis simplifies to a sum of five binomial coefficient terms, which is a closed form as the number of terms is constant.\n\n"
