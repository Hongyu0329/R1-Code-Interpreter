    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we first need to understand how this basis set is defined for each type of atom.\n\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. This means that core orbitals are described by a single contracted function, while valence orbitals are \"split\" into two contracted functions (an inner and an outer part).\n\nFor a **carbon atom (C)**, which has the electron configuration 1s²2s²2p², the breakdown is as follows:\n*   **1s (core):** One contracted function (made up of 6 primitive Gaussians).\n*   **2s (valence):** Two contracted functions (one from a contraction of 3 primitives and one from a single primitive).\n*   **2p (valence):** Two sets of p-orbitals, and since p-orbitals come in sets of three (px, py, pz), this results in 2 * 3 = 6 contracted functions.\n\nTherefore, each carbon atom has a total of 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nFor a **hydrogen atom (H)**, with the electron configuration 1s¹, the breakdown is:\n*   **1s (valence):** Two contracted functions (one from a contraction of 3 primitives and one from a single primitive).\n\nSo, each hydrogen atom has 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nToluene has the chemical formula **C7H8**. Now we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions:\n*   **For the 7 carbon atoms:** 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **For the 8 hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\n**Total contracted Gaussian functions** = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
