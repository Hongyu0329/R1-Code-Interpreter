    "The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" comes from the play *Adelphoe* by the Roman playwright Terence. It is an example of an iambic senarius, a common meter in Roman comedy, which consists of six iambic feet. The scansion of this meter, particularly in comedy, allows for frequent substitutions and metrical variations like elision.\n\nThe scansion is as follows, taking into account elision (where `bene esse` becomes `ben' esse`) and metrical substitutions:\n\n<<<L S S S L L L L S S L L S>>>"
