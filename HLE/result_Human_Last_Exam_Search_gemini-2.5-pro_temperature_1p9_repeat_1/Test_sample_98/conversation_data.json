    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned to stand on one of its triangular faces, and it is filled with water to half of its total height, the surface of the water will form a **decagon**.\n\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. When it rests on one of its faces, that triangular face becomes its base.\n\nThe shape of the water's surface is determined by the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at the level of the water. As the water level rises from the base, the cross-sectional shape changes. When the tank is half-filled, the water level is at the midpoint of the icosahedron's height.\n\nAt this half-height, the horizontal plane intersects ten of the icosahedron's faces. The resulting cross-section is a decagon (a ten-sided polygon). It is important to note that this decagon is not regular; while its sides will have equal length due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, the internal angles will not all be identical.\n\nInterestingly, if the icosahedron were to be oriented differently, such as standing on a vertex, the cross-section at its midpoint would be different. For instance, a cross-section perpendicular to an axis passing through two opposite vertices would be a regular hexagon at the midpoint. However, when resting on a face, the resulting shape of the water surface at half-full is a decagon.\n\n<<<decagon>>>"
