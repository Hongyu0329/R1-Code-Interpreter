    "To find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the 8-point sequence `{x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`, we first need to understand what this operation implies. Taking an M-point DFT of an N-point sequence (where N > M) involves a process called time-domain aliasing. The result is equivalent to decimating the N-point DFT of the sequence.\n\nHere, we will demonstrate two methods to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Method 1: Direct Calculation via Time Aliasing\n\n**Step 1: Determine the time-domain sequences x(n) and h(n)**\n\nFirst, we find the 4-point inverse DFT (IDFT) of X(k) and H(k). The IDFT formula is:\n`z(n) = (1/4) * Σ [Z(k) * exp(j * 2 * π * n * k / 4)]` for k from 0 to 3.\n\nFor `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`, the IDFT `x(n)` is:\n*   x(0) = (1/4) * (1 + j - 1 - j) = 0\n*   x(1) = (1/4) * (1 + j(j) - 1(-1) - j(-j)) = (1/4) * (1 - 1 + 1 - 1) = 0\n*   x(2) = (1/4) * (1 + j(-1) - 1(1) - j(-1)) = (1/4) * (1 - j - 1 + j) = 0\n*   x(3) = (1/4) * (1 + j(-j) - 1(-1) - j(j)) = (1/4) * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 1\nSo, `x(n) = [0, 0, 0, 1]`.\n\nFor `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`, the IDFT `h(n)` is:\n*   h(0) = (1/4) * (0 + 1+j + 1 + 1-j) = 3/4\n*   h(1) = (1/4) * (0 + (1+j)(j) + 1(-1) + (1-j)(-j)) = (1/4) * (j-1 - 1 -j-1) = -3/4\n*   h(2) = (1/4) * (0 + (1+j)(-1) + 1(1) + (1-j)(-1)) = (1/4) * (-1-j + 1 -1+j) = -1/4\n*   h(3) = (1/4) * (0 + (1+j)(-j) + 1(-1) + (1-j)(j)) = (1/4) * (-j+1 - 1 +j+1) = 1/4\nSo, `h(n) = [0.75, -0.75, -0.25, 0.25]`.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the 8-point and aliased 4-point sequences**\n\nThe 8-point sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n`y(n) = {0, 0.75, 0, -0.75, 0, -0.25, 1, 0.25}`\n\nTo find the 4-point DFT, we create a 4-point aliased sequence `y_4(n)` where `y_4(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)`:\n*   y_4(0) = y(0) + y(4) = 0 + 0 = 0\n*   y_4(1) = y(1) + y(5) = 0.75 + (-0.25) = 0.5\n*   y_4(2) = y(2) + y(6) = 0 + 1 = 1\n*   y_4(3) = y(3) + y(7) = -0.75 + 0.25 = -0.5\nSo, `y_4(n) = [0, 0.5, 1, -0.5]`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the 4-point DFT**\n\nNow, we compute the DFT of `y_4(n)`, let's call it `Y_4(k)`:\n*   Y_4(0) = 0 + 0.5 + 1 - 0.5 = 1\n*   Y_4(1) = 0 + 0.5(-j) + 1(-1) - 0.5(j) = -1 - j\n*   Y_4(2) = 0 + 0.5(-1) + 1(1) - 0.5(-1) = 1\n*   Y_4(3) = 0 + 0.5(j) + 1(-1) - 0.5(-j) = -1 + j\n\n### Method 2: Using DFT Properties (Decimation in Frequency)\n\nThis method is faster if you are familiar with DFT properties.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence**\n\nThe 8-point sequence `y(n)` is composed of the even-indexed terms from `x(n)` and the odd-indexed terms from `h(n)`. The 8-point DFT, `Y_8(k)`, can be found using the decimation-in-time approach. This relates `Y_8(k)` to the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`:\n*   Y_8(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)  for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n*   Y_8(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n\nwhere `W_N^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / N)`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the 8-point DFT to the 4-point DFT**\n\nA key property of the DFT is that the M-point DFT of a time-aliased N-point sequence is equivalent to decimating the N-point DFT. In this case, the 4-point DFT `Y_4(k)` is simply `Y_8(2k)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nWe only need to calculate `Y_8(0)`, `Y_8(2)`, `Y_8(4)`, and `Y_8(6)`:\n*   **Y_4(0) = Y_8(0):**\n    `Y_8(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n*   **Y_4(1) = Y_8(2):**\n    `Y_8(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n*   **Y_4(2) = Y_8(4):**\n    `Y_8(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n*   **Y_4(3) = Y_8(6):**\n    `Y_8(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is:\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
