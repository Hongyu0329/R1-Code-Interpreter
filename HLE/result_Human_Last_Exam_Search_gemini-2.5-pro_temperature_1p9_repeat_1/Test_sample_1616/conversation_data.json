    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English that shortens a tense (long) vowel in a word when it is followed by two or more syllables, with the first of those subsequent syllables being unstressed. For this rule to apply, the resulting word must generally be at least three syllables long.\n\nLet's analyze each word:\n*   **southern**: This word is derived from \"south.\" The vowel in \"south\" /aʊ/ becomes lax in \"southern\" /ˈsʌðərn/. Although the modern form is disyllabic, the process of trisyllabic laxing applied to its earlier trisyllabic form, *southerne*.\n*   **derivative**: This word comes from \"derive.\" The tense vowel /aɪ/ in \"derive\" changes to the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the four-syllable word \"derivative.\" This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: Derived from \"serene,\" the tense vowel /iː/ in \"serene\" becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in the four-syllable word \"serenity.\" This is also a clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **gratitude**: This word is related to \"grateful.\" The tense vowel /eɪ/ in \"grateful\" changes to the lax vowel /æ/ in the three-syllable word \"gratitude.\" This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: This word is derived from \"shade.\" The tense vowel /eɪ/ in \"shade\" becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in \"shadow.\" However, since \"shadow\" is a two-syllable word, this process is known as disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This word entered English from Old French *plaisant*. It is a disyllabic word, and as such, does not meet the structural requirements for trisyllabic laxing to apply. Although there is a related English word \"please\" with a tense vowel, the adjective \"pleasant\" was borrowed as a complete unit and did not undergo the laxing process as a derivation within English.\n\nBoth \"shadow\" and \"pleasant\" have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing because they are disyllabic words. However, \"shadow\" is a textbook example of a related process, *disyllabic laxing*. \"Pleasant,\" on the other hand, was borrowed into English in its current form and did not undergo a process of laxing from a base word within English sound development. Given the options, \"shadow\" exemplifies a different, but related, laxing rule, making it a distinct case from the trisyllabic examples. \"Pleasant\" stands out as not fitting the pattern of derivation and subsequent vowel laxing within English that characterizes the other words on the list. But since \"shadow\" clearly undergoes a different type of laxing, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow"
