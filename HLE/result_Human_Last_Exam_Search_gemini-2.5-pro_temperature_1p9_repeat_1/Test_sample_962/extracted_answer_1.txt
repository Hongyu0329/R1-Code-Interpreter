A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed by using a Schnorr-based signature framework, incorporating a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol with verifiable secret sharing to create and distribute the key shares without a single point of failure. The two-round signing protocol consists of a pre-computation/commitment round where participants exchange nonce commitments, followed by a signing round where they generate and combine partial signatures. To achieve tight security, the design must rely on a standard cryptographic assumption like the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem and employ proof techniques that avoid rewinding. The protocol must also be proven secure under a strong security model like EUF-CMA against adaptive adversaries. Schemes like FROST provide a foundational design for two-round Schnorr threshold signatures, and recent advancements in related multi-signature schemes demonstrate techniques to achieve tight security proofs.
