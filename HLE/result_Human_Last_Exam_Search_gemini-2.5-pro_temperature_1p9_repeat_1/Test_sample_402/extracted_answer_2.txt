A command-line filtering strategy based on log2 fold change has been provided. The strategy involves using a downstream R script to process the output of a differential expression analysis (like DESeq2). The provided R script, `filter_contaminants.R`, is designed to be executed from the command line and filters out genes with a log2 fold change below a user-defined negative threshold, effectively removing the signal from contaminating cancer cells present in the CAR-only samples. This approach is justified by the known biological role of IL-15 in promoting T-cell gene upregulation, making a strong negative fold-change signature likely an artifact of the contamination. The steps for implementation, including the full script and execution commands, are detailed above.
