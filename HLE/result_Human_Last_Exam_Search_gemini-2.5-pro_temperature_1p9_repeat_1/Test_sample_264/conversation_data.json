    "Let's carefully analyze the problem. We have two cubes, each with a side length of 1. One cube is shifted relative to the other by a distance of 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n\n**1. Defining the coordinate system and the first cube:**\nLet the first cube, C1, be axis-aligned and have one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (1,1,1). The set of points (x, y, z) in this cube satisfies the inequalities:\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n**2. Understanding the shift:**\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the vertex (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". This means the translation vector has a magnitude of 1/2 and is in the direction of the main diagonal.\n\nThe unit vector in the direction of the main diagonal is **u** = **d** / ||**d**|| = (1, 1, 1) / √(1² + 1² + 1²) = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).\n\nThe shift vector **s** is therefore:\n**s** = (1/2) * **u** = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\n\n**3. Defining the second cube:**\nThe second cube, C2, is the first cube shifted by the vector **s**. A point (x', y', z') is in C2 if the original point (x, y, z) = (x' - 1/(2√3), y' - 1/(2√3), z' - 1/(2√3)) is in C1. This gives the inequalities for C2:\n1/(2√3) ≤ x' ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n1/(2√3) ≤ y' ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n1/(2√3) ≤ z' ≤ 1 + 1/(2√3)\n\n**4. Calculating the intersection:**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is a smaller cube defined by the points (x, y, z) that satisfy the inequalities for both C1 and C2. We find the intersection of the coordinate intervals:\n\n*   For the x-axis: ∩ [1/(2√3), 1 + 1/(2√3)] = [1/(2√3), 1]\n*   For the y-axis: ∩ [1/(2√3), 1 + 1/(2√3)] = [1/(2√3), 1]\n*   For the z-axis: ∩ [1/(2√3), 1 + 1/(2√3)] = [1/(2√3), 1]\n\nThe intersection is a cube, and the side length of this cube is the length of the interval [1/(2√3), 1], which is:\nSide length = 1 - 1/(2√3)\n\n**5. Calculating the volume:**\nThe volume of the intersection is the cube of its side length:\nVolume = (1 - 1/(2√3))³\n\nTo simplify this expression:\nVolume = 1³ - 3(1)²(1/(2√3)) + 3(1)(1/(2√3))² - (1/(2√3))³\nVolume = 1 - 3/(2√3) + 3/(4 * 3) - 1/(8 * 3√3)\nVolume = 1 - √3/2 + 1/4 - 1/(24√3)\nVolume = 5/4 - √3/2 - √3/72\nVolume = 5/4 - (36√3)/72 - √3/72\nVolume = 5/4 - (37√3)/72\n\nThis can be written as (90 - 37√3) / 72.\nNumerically, this is approximately:\nVolume ≈ (90 - 37 * 1.73205) / 72\nVolume ≈ (90 - 64.08585) / 72\nVolume ≈ 25.91415 / 72\nVolume ≈ 0.3599\n\nA possible ambiguity: If \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" meant a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), the intersection would be a cube with a side length of 1/2, and the volume would be (1/2)³ = 1/8. However, the length of the shift vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) is √(3/4) = √3/2, which is not 1/2. Therefore, the most accurate interpretation of the problem statement leads to the first result.\n\n<<<5/4 - (37*sqrt(3))/72>>>"
