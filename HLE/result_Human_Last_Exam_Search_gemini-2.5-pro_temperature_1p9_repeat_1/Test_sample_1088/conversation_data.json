    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single fixed value; it depends on the specific atoms that constitute a molecule. The notation \"6-311G\\*\\*\" provides the recipe for constructing the basis set for each atom. Below is a breakdown of how to calculate the number of primitive Gaussians for hydrogen and for second-row heavy atoms (like Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen).\n\nThe calculation can be broken down based on the notation:\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes a triple-zeta split-valence basis set.\n    *   **6-**: The core electrons are described by a single basis function, which is a contracted linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **-311**: The valence electrons are described by three basis functions. The first is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, while the second and third are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n*   **\\*\\***: The two asterisks denote the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first asterisk adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy atoms (all non-hydrogen atoms). This typically consists of 5 spherical harmonic d-functions.\n    *   The second asterisk adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Calculation for Hydrogen (H)**\n\n*   **Valence (1s orbital)**: For hydrogen, the \"311\" split means its 1s orbital is represented by functions composed of 3, 1, and 1 primitives. This sums to 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians for the s-orbital.\n*   **Polarization (`**`)**: A set of p-type polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z) is added. These are three individual, uncontracted Gaussian functions, adding 3 primitives.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen**: 5 (s-primitives) + 3 (p-primitives) = 8 primitive Gaussians.\n\n### **Calculation for Second-Row Heavy Atoms (e.g., C, N, O)**\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital)**: This is described by a single contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals)**: The \"311\" split applies to the valence orbitals. The 2s and 2p orbitals are typically treated together (they share exponents).\n    *   **2s orbital**: The number of primitives is 3 + 1 + 1 = **5**.\n    *   **2p orbitals**: There are three 2p orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z), and each is described by the same 3+1+1 set of primitives. So, the total for the 2p orbitals is 3 × (3 + 1 + 1) = **15** primitives.\n*   **Polarization (`*`)**: A single set of d-type polarization functions is added. Using spherical harmonics (the common convention for this basis set), this set has 5 functions (d_xy, d_yz, d_xz, d_x2-y2, d_z2), each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds **5** primitives.\n*   **Total for a Second-Row Heavy Atom**: 6 (1s) + 5 (2s) + 15 (2p) + 5 (d) = **31 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nThis can be verified with the literature, where methanol (CH₃OH), which has one carbon, one oxygen, and four hydrogens, is stated to have 94 primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G** basis set. Our calculation confirms this: (1 × 31 for C) + (1 × 31 for O) + (4 × 8 for H) = 31 + 31 + 32 = 94.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is 8 for each Hydrogen atom and 31 for each second-row heavy atom (like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen). To find the total for a molecule, you sum the primitives for all of its constituent atoms.>>>"
