    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player can win a Triple Crown for either batting or pitching, with each being a rare and celebrated accomplishment. The number of winners varies depending on the inclusion of players from the Negro Leagues, whose statistics were officially incorporated into MLB records in 2020.\n\n### Batting Triple Crown Winners\n\nA hitter wins the Triple Crown by leading their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nIncluding the Negro Leagues, there have been 28 batting Triple Crown winners. Some sources may cite 23 or 27 winners, with slight variations due to differing inclusion criteria and historical record-keeping. Of these, four players have won the award multiple times: Oscar Charleston (3 times), Rogers Hornsby (2 times), Josh Gibson (2 times), and Ted Williams (2 times).\n\nIn the American and National Leagues specifically, there have been 17 instances of a player winning the batting Triple Crown. The most recent player to achieve this feat was Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers in 2012, which was the first time in 45 years a player had won the batting Triple Crown.\n\n### Pitching Triple Crown Winners\n\nA pitcher achieves the Triple Crown by leading their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).\n\nWhen including the Negro Leagues, there have been 35 pitchers who have won the Triple Crown, accomplishing the feat a total of 45 times. Several pitchers have won it more than once, including Hall of Famers like Walter Johnson and Sandy Koufax, who each won it three times. Another source indicates there have been 38 pitching Triple Crown winners since 1877.\n\nLooking solely at the American and National Leagues since ERA became an official statistic in 1913, 22 pitchers have won the Triple Crown a combined 31 times. Unlike the long drought for the batting Triple Crown, the pitching version has been achieved more recently.\n\n<<<In total, combining both batting and pitching and including the Negro Leagues, there have been over 60 Triple Crown winners in MLB history.>>>"
