    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem.\n\nThe strategy to achieve maximum memory efficiency is as follows:\n1.  **Avoid Storing the Input String**: Instead of reading the entire string into a large character array, the program reads the input one character at a time using `getchar()`. This reduces memory usage from ~1001 bytes to just a single byte for the character being processed.\n2.  **Use Counting Sort**: Since the numbers are limited to a very small range (1, 2, 3, 4), counting sort is the ideal algorithm. We only need an array of 4 counters to store the frequency of each number.\n3.  **Use Minimum-Size Integer Types**: The variables are declared using the smallest possible standard C data types that can safely store the required range of values. The `stdint.h` header is used for explicit-sized types like `uint16_t` to ensure portability.\n    *   The counts of each number can go up to a maximum of 501 (for an input like \"1+1+...+1\" of length 999). A `uint16_t` (2 bytes, range 0-65535) is sufficient.\n    *   Loop counters are sized appropriately. The outer loop runs 4 times, so a `char` (1 byte) is enough. The inner loop can run up to ~501 times, so a `uint16_t` is required.\n4.  **Eliminate Helper Flags**: The logic for printing the `+` symbols is handled by printing the very first number separately, then looping through the remaining numbers and prepending each with a `+`. This avoids the need for a boolean flag variable.\n\n### C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdint.h>\n\n/**\n * Solves the Xenia and the Sum problem with maximum memory efficiency.\n * Reads input character by character, uses counting sort with minimal size\n * integer types, and avoids storing the full input string.\n */\nint main() {\n    // counts[0] for '1', counts[1] for '2', etc.\n    // The maximum count for any digit is (1000+1)/2 = 501.\n    // uint16_t (2 bytes) is sufficient (0-65535).\n    uint16_t counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // Variable to read one input character at a time.\n    char c;\n\n    // Loop counters. 'i' needs to go 0-3 (char is fine).\n    // 'j' needs to go up to ~501 (uint16_t is needed).\n    char i;\n    uint16_t j;\n\n    // Read from standard input until a newline or end-of-file.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // If the character is a digit, increment its counter.\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Find and print the very first number in the sorted sum.\n    // This special handling avoids needing a flag variable for printing '+'.\n    char first_term_found = 0;\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        if (counts[i] > 0) {\n            putchar(i + '1'); // Print the digit\n            counts[i]--;      // Decrement its count\n            first_term_found = 1;\n            break;            // Exit after printing the first number\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If no numbers were in the input, we are done.\n    if (!first_term_found) {\n        putchar('\\n');\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    // Loop through all number counts again to print the rest of the sum.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            putchar('+');\n            putchar(i + '1');\n        }\n    }\n    \n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of all declared variables. The calculation assumes a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(uint16_t)` is 2 bytes.\n\n*   **`uint16_t counts[4]`**: An array of 4 unsigned 16-bit integers.\n    *   Memory = `4 * sizeof(uint16_t)` = `4 * 2` = 8 bytes.\n*   **`char c`**: A single character to store input.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n*   **`char i`**: A loop counter for the outer loop (0-3).\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n*   **`uint16_t j`**: A loop counter for the inner loop (up to ~501).\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(uint16_t)` = 2 bytes.\n*   **`char first_term_found`**: A flag to handle empty input.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nm = 8 bytes (for `counts`) + 1 byte (for `c`) + 1 byte (for `i`) + 2 bytes (for `j`) + 1 byte (for `first_term_found`) = **13 bytes**.\n\n<<<13>>>"
