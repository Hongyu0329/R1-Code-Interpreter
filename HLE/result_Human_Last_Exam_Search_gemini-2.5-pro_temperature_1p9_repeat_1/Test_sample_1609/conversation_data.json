    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of *n* variables, denoted as a(n), is given by the formula 2<sup>(n-1)</sup>. This formula arises from the arrangement of minterms in a Karnaugh map, where the maximum number of prime implicants is achieved when no further simplification of product terms is possible.\n\nFor a Boolean function of 4 variables (n=4), the maximal number of prime implicants, a(4), can be calculated as follows:\n\na(4) = 2<sup>(4-1)</sup> = 2<sup>3</sup> = 8.\n\nTherefore, a Boolean function of 4 variables can have a maximum of 8 prime implicants.\n\n<<<8>>>"
