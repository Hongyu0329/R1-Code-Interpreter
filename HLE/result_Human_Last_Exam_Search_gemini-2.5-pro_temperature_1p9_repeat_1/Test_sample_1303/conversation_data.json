    "The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is a small molecule with the molecular formula C24H29N5O3. Its primary protein target has been identified as the **SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro)**, also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro). This enzyme is crucial for the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Consequently, numerous small molecules have been investigated as potential inhibitors that form protein-ligand interactions with this protease.\n\nA variety of small molecules have been demonstrated to interact with and inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. These can be categorized as follows:\n\n### Clinically Approved Drugs and Investigational Compounds\n*   **Nirmatrelvir**: A potent and FDA-approved inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **Boceprevir, Narlaprevir, and Telaprevir**: These are clinically approved protease inhibitors for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) that have been found to bind specifically to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **Lopinavir and Ritonavir**: These HIV protease inhibitors have demonstrated the ability to bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and have been studied for their potential to suppress the virus.\n*   **Nelfinavir**: Another HIV protease inhibitor that has been predicted to be a potential inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro due to its strong binding affinity.\n*   **GC-376**: A broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor that has been shown to tightly bind to and effectively inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **Remdesivir, Favipiravir, and Galidesivir**: While these antiviral drugs primarily target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the virus, they are relevant small molecules in the context of COVID-19 therapeutics.\n*   **Camostat mesylate**: This molecule inhibits TMPRSS2, a host serine protease that plays a role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells.\n\n### Investigational Small Molecule Inhibitors\n*   **Calpain Inhibitors II and XII**: These have been demonstrated to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **Thioester compounds**: A series of novel and potent Mpro inhibitors, with compounds **3w** and **3x** showing excellent inhibitory activity.\n*   **X77**: A non-covalent, broad-spectrum inhibitor that binds to the substrate-binding cleft of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **Aldehyde derivatives**: Compounds designated as **11a**, **16**, **17**, and **18** have shown high inhibitory activity against the Mpro and antiviral effects. The aldehyde group in these molecules can covalently bind to the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys145) of the protease.\n*   **N3**: A covalent inhibitor that has been co-crystallized with the Mpro, providing a structural basis for inhibitor design.\n*   **Myricetin and Benserazide**: Identified as novel nanomolar inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro through a combination of computational and experimental methods.\n\n### Natural and Other Compounds\n*   **Suramin**: A large molecule that has shown stable interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.\n*   **2S albumin and Flocculating protein**: These proteins have also been found to interact with the main protease.\n\nThe interaction of these small molecules with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease typically occurs at its active site, which includes a catalytic dyad of Cysteine-145 and Histidine-41. Many inhibitors are designed to form covalent or non-covalent bonds with these key residues, thereby blocking the enzyme's ability to process viral polyproteins and halting viral replication."
