    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA complete classification of homogeneous planar continua shows that, up to homeomorphism, there are four such classes. A continuum is a compact and connected metric space. For a space to be homogeneous, any point can be mapped to any other point by a homeomorphism of the space onto itself.\n\nThe four homeomorphism classes are:\n*   **The point**: This is considered a degenerate continuum.\n*   **The simple closed curve (or circle)**: This is a one-dimensional continuum.\n*   **The pseudo-arc**: This is a one-dimensional, hereditarily indecomposable continuum, meaning it cannot be broken down into a finite number of smaller proper continua. It is the only hereditarily indecomposable arc-like continuum.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs**: This is formed by a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle.\n\nIn 2014, a proof by Hoehn and Oversteegen established that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum must be one of the latter three classes, thus completing the classification. Prior to this, in the 1950s, F. Burton Jones had classified homogeneous plane continua into three types, which helped guide the research that led to the final classification.\n\n<<<4>>>"
