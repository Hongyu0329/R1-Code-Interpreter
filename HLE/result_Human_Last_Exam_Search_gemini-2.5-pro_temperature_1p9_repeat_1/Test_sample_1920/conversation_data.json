    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor $d$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nThrough calculation, we determine that:\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$\nThe conductor is a product of distinct odd primes.\n\n### Step 2: Conditions for a primitive character of conductor $d$\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ (where $p_i$ are distinct primes) is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$.\nFor a character modulo a prime $p$, it is primitive if and only if it is not the trivial (principal) character. The trivial character is the only character of order 1. Therefore, for each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the character component $\\chi_p$ must have an order greater than 1.\n\n### Step 3: Condition on the order of the character\nThe order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\n### Step 4: Number of characters of a specific order modulo a prime\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is given by $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $p-1$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet's check the values of $p-1$ for our prime factors:\n*   For $p=7$, $p-1=6$\n*   For $p=13$, $p-1=12$\n*   For $p=19$, $p-1=18$\n*   For $p=31$, $p-1=30$\n\nThe condition that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)) = 6$ implies that the order of each component character $\\chi_p$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_p$ must be primitive, its order must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each $\\chi_p$ are 2, 3, and 6.\n\nFor each prime factor $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the divisors of $p-1$ include 2, 3, and 6. Therefore, for each prime, we can count the number of available primitive characters with these orders:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, the number of primitive characters whose order divides 6 is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the total number of characters\nWe want to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n\n1.  **Total combinations of primitive characters with orders dividing 6:**\n    For each of the four prime components, there are 5 possible choices for a primitive character with an order dividing 6. The total number of such combinations is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n2.  **Subtract combinations where the lcm is not 6:**\n    The lcm of the orders will not be 6 if the orders of all component characters are divisors of 2 or if they are all divisors of 3.\n    *   **Case 1: The lcm divides 2.**\n        This occurs if the order of each component character $\\chi_p$ is 2 (since they must be primitive). For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So, there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$ such character composition. The resulting character $\\chi$ will have order 2.\n    *   **Case 2: The lcm divides 3.**\n        This occurs if the order of each component character $\\chi_p$ is 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So, there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$ such character compositions. The resulting character $\\chi$ will have order 3.\n\nThe sets of characters whose order divides 2 and whose order divides 3 are disjoint (except for order 1, which we have excluded).\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations with orders dividing 6, minus those with an order that strictly divides 6 (i.e., order 2 or 3).\nNumber of characters = (Total combinations) - (Combinations of order 2) - (Combinations of order 3)\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nThus, there are 608 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6.\n\n<<<608>>>"
