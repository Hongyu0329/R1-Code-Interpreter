    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix A:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe can use the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)\n\nFor matrix A:\na = 2, b = -1, c = -1\nd = -1, e = 2, f = -1\ng = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\ndet(A) = 2(2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1)((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1)((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2(3) - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, we can observe that the sum of the rows of the matrix is the zero vector:\nRow 1 + Row 2 + Row 3 = [(2-1-1), (-1+2-1), (-1-1+2)] =\nA property of determinants is that if the rows (or columns) of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. Since the sum of the rows is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent, and therefore the determinant of the matrix A is 0.\n\nThe additional context about the \"Markov quiver for $m_{1/2} = 13$\" might imply that this specific matrix A is the adjacency matrix for that particular mathematical object. Regardless of the interpretation of that term, since the matrix A is explicitly provided, its determinant is calculated as above.\n\n<<<0>>>"
