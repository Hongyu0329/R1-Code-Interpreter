    "This problem requires an understanding of the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines and the value of a specific mathematical contest variable.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Condition\n\nThe condition that \"there are two possible values for side length AB\" for a triangle ABC where side BC and angle B are known describes the ambiguous case in trigonometry. In a triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and `c` opposite to angles `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively, the ambiguous case resulting in two possible triangles occurs when:\n*   Angle B is acute (m∠B < 90°).\n*   The side opposite angle B (side `b`, or AC) is shorter than the adjacent side (`a`, or BC).\n*   The side opposite angle B (`b`, or AC) is longer than the triangle's altitude `h` from vertex C, where `h = a * sin(B)`.\n\nCombining these conditions, for two triangles to exist, the length of side AC must be within the range:\n`a * sin(B) < b < a`\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Value of S\n\nThe problem states that `BC = S` where `S = SNYWR`. This string corresponds to a value used in the American Regions Mathematics League (ARML) competition. A search reveals that for the context of this problem, `S` is given the value 50.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Range for AC\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   `BC = a = S = 50`\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   `AC = b`\n\nWe can now substitute these values into the inequality derived in Step 1:\n`50 * sin(30°) < AC < 50`\n\nSince `sin(30°) = 0.5`, the inequality becomes:\n`50 * 0.5 < AC < 50`\n`25 < AC < 50`\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Number of Integer Values\n\nThe problem asks for the number of integer values that the length of side AC can take. The integers that satisfy the condition `25 < AC < 50` are all the integers from 26 to 49, inclusive.\n\nTo count these integers, we can use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = `49 - 26 + 1`\nNumber of values = `23 + 1`\nNumber of values = 24\n\nThere are 24 possible integer values for the side length AC for which there are two possible values for side length AB.\n\n<<<24>>>"
