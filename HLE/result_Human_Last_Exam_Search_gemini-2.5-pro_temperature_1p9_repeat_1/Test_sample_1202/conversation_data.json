    "After gene duplication, the resulting two gene copies are initially redundant. This redundancy means that mutations in one copy are often not detrimental to the organism, as the other copy can still perform the original function. The most common fate for a duplicated gene is pseudogenization, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene. However, several mechanisms can lead to the retention and subsequent divergence of both copies.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange that can make the sequences of the two duplicated genes more similar to each other. This process, known as concerted evolution, counteracts divergence and promotes homogenization. Therefore, it is not the primary mechanism responsible for divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process by which one of the duplicate genes becomes non-functional. As this involves the functional loss of one copy, it is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention of two functional, diverging genes.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This occurs when one of the duplicated genes retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a new, beneficial function. Natural selection then maintains both genes, as each performs a distinct, necessary role. This is a key adaptive mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicates.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this scenario, the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (e.g., in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each of the two copies accumulates degenerative mutations that silence a different subfunction. As a result, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally performed. This process, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, provides a powerful neutral mechanism for preserving both copies.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes the rapid evolution of many new species from a single common ancestor. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism for retaining individual duplicate genes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are major accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely initial event. This is because it can occur through the accumulation of relatively common, neutral degenerative mutations, whereas neofunctionalization requires the rarer event of a mutation that confers a new, selectively advantageous function. By preserving both gene copies through a neutral process, subfunctionalization can provide an extended period during which neofunctionalization may subsequently occur. Therefore, it represents a highly probable and critical pathway for the long-term survival and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
