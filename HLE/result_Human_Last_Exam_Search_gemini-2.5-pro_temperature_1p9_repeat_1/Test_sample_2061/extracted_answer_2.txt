I am unable to provide a numerical answer as the problem statement is inconsistent. The condition for the integral to have a positive value implies $\alpha < 0.71$, which leads to a very small value for the integral. This contradicts the given very large value of $B$. Therefore, no solution for $\alpha > 0$ exists.
