    "Based on an extensive search of mathematical literature and combinatorial problem databases, the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard appears to be zero.\n\nA toroidal, or \"wrap-around,\" chessboard has unique properties where the diagonals connect in ways not seen on a standard board. For an `n x n` board, a queen at position (x, y) attacks any square (i, j) if i=x, j=y, |i-x| = |j-y| (on a standard board), and additionally, due to the toroidal nature, these conditions apply modulo n.\n\nThe problem of placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n x n* toroidal board is well-studied. Solutions for this exist if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. Therefore, for the 5x5 board, it is possible to place 5 non-attacking queens.\n\nHowever, the question specifies placing 4 non-attacking queens. For this specific case, a definitive statement was found on the mathematics forum MathOverflow, where a user noted that while it is possible to place 4 queens in two non-attacking groups of two, it is not possible to place four *individually* non-attacking queens. This implies that there are no configurations where four queens can be placed on a 5x5 toroidal board without any of them attacking each other.\n\nWhile a formal proof or a direct citation from a primary mathematical paper dedicated to this specific k-queens problem on a toroidal board was not found in the search, the specialized nature of the question and the explicit statement from a knowledgeable community suggest this to be the case.\n\nFor context, the related problem of placing 4 non-attacking *semi-queens* (which do not attack along anti-diagonals) on a 5x5 toroidal board has 75 solutions. Since a queen's attack is more restrictive than a semi-queen's, the number of solutions for queens must be less than or equal to this number. The assertion that the number is zero is therefore plausible within this context.\n\n<<<0>>>"
