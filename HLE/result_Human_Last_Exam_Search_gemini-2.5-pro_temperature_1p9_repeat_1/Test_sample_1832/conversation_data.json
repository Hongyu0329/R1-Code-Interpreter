    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric, uncharged, non-rotating gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The non-zero Christoffel symbols, which represent the gravitational field's strength, can be calculated from this metric.\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric are:\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt} = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr} = \\frac{-M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi} = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{rt} = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\cot\\theta$\n\nIt is important to note that the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices, i.e., $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$. The list above accounts for this symmetry. For example, $\\Gamma^t_{rt} = \\Gamma^t_{tr}$.\n\nCounting these unique non-zero components reveals that there are 9 of them.\n\n<<<9>>>"
