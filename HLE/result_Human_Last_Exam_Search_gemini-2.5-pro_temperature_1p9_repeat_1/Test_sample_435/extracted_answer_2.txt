Based on the evidence, I predict that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit an increased and more sustained release of effector cytokines, such as IFN-Î³ and granzyme B, leading to enhanced anti-tumor activity. There is also a possibility of a reduced risk of severe Cytokine Release Syndrome compared to cells manufactured with other cytokines like IL-2.
