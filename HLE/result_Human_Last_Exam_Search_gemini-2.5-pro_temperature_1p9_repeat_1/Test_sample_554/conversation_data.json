    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThis is based on the concept of a \"perfluorinated\" compound, where all hydrogen atoms in the original organic molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms. While various nanocars with different chemical structures have been synthesized, one specific example is a nanocar with the chemical formula C430H274O12.\n\nIf this particular nanocar were to be perfluorinated, each of the 274 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with a fluorine atom. This would result in a molecule with the formula C430F274O12. Therefore, a perfluorinated version of this nanocar would hypothetically contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nIt's important to note that different nanocar designs exist with varying numbers of atoms. For instance, another nanocar has the formula C85H59N5Zn. A perfluorinated version of this nanocar would contain 59 fluorine atoms. However, the larger C430H274O12 structure provides a more striking hypothetical example.\n\n<<<274>>>"
