    "In the context of the Gauss class number problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48 is 269.\n\nThe complete list of imaginary quadratic fields with class numbers up to 100 was determined by Mark Watkins in 2004. While Watkins' original publication describes the methodology, the extensive lists of discriminants are not fully detailed within the paper itself. However, this data has been integrated into various mathematical software packages and is cited in related research. Specifically, the SageMath documentation explicitly mentions the use of Watkins' results to provide the count of fundamental negative discriminants for a given class number up to 100.\n\nPrevious work by others had solved the problem for smaller class numbers. For instance, there are 54 imaginary quadratic fields with class number 4. The work of Watkins significantly extended these results, providing the definitive count for all class numbers through 100.\n\n<<<269>>>"
