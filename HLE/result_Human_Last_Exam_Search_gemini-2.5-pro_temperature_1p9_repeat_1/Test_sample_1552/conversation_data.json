    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is determined by the Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a₂`. The spectral action is given by `Tr(f(D²/Λ²))`, where `D` is the gauged Dirac operator and `Λ` is the cutoff scale. Its asymptotic expansion for large `Λ` is of the form `∑_{n=0}^∞ c_n Λ^{4-2n}`, where the coefficients `c_n` are given by integrals of the local Seeley-DeWitt coefficients `a_n(x, D²)`. Specifically, the term for `n=2` is related to `a₂(D²)`, which corresponds to the dimensionless coefficient in 4-dimensions and gives rise to the Yang-Mills action term, among others.\n\nFor a massless Dirac spinor field in four dimensions coupled to a gauge field, the relevant operator is the square of the Dirac operator, `D²`. Using the Bochner-Lichnerowicz formula, this operator can be expressed as a generalized Laplacian:\n`D² = -g^{μν}∇_μ∇_ν + E`\nwhere `∇_μ = ∂_μ + (1/4)ω_{μab}γ^{ab} + A_μ` is the covariant derivative including the spin connection `ω` and the gauge connection `A`, and `E = (1/4)R`. The full curvature of the connection `∇` is `Ω_{μν} = [∇_μ, ∇_ν] = (1/4)R_{μνab}γ^{ab} + F_{μν}`, where `R_{μνab}` is the Riemann curvature tensor and `F_{μν}` is the gauge field strength.\n\nThe local second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, `a₂(x)`, for a general second-order operator of the form `-Δ + E` on the space of spinors is given by the formula:\n`a₂(x) = tr[ (1/180) R_{αβμν}R^{αβμν} - (1/180) R_{μν}R^{μν} + (1/60)□R + (1/2)E² + (1/6)RE + (1/12)Ω_{μν}Ω^{μν} ]`\nwhere `tr` denotes the trace over the spinor and gauge group indices.\n\nFor the specific case of a massless gauged Dirac spinor, we substitute the expressions for `E` and `Ω_{μν}` and take the trace. The dimension of the Dirac spinor space is 4. The final expression for the density `a₂(x)` is a sum of gravitational and gauge-dependent terms. After performing the trace over the spinorial indices, the coefficient is:\n\n`a₂(x) = (1/360) (5 R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} - 4 R_{μν}R^{μν} + 5 R²) + (1/12)tr_γ(1) Tr_G(F_{μν}F^{μν})`\nThis can be simplified using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in 4D. The key part for the gauge field is the term containing the square of the field strength `F_{μν}`.\n\nThe second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, integrated over a 4-dimensional manifold M, is given by the integral of the local `a₂` density. The density `a₂(x)` is:\n\n<<<`(1/ (4π)² ) * tr [ (1/120)R_{αβμν}R^{αβμν} - (1/120)R_{αβ}R^{αβ} - (1/60)R R + (1/6)∇_{μ}∇^{μ}R + (1/12) F_{μν}F^{μν} ]`>>>"
