The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor, arising from the weak localization effect, is evaluated by considering the enhanced probability of the electron returning to its origin due to quantum interference. This correction, δσ, is given by δσ ≈ - (e² / ( (2π)^(3/2) * D^(1/2) * τ^(1/2) )), where 'e' is the elementary charge, 'D' is the diffusion coefficient, and 'τ' is the elastic scattering time.
