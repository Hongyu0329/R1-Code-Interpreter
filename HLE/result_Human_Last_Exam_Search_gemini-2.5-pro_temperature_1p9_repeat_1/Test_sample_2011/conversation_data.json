    "To determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n = 128 vertices, let's first understand the key terms.\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A collection of 128 points (vertices) and lines (edges) connecting pairs of them.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** Given a subset of vertices of a graph, the induced subgraph consists of those vertices and all the edges that connect pairs of vertices in that subset in the original graph.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. An induced subgraph on a clique of size *k* is a complete graph, denoted as *K*<sub>*k*</sub>.\n*   **Clique Size:** The number of vertices in a clique.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of different values of *k* for which a graph *G* with 128 vertices has an induced subgraph that is a clique of size *k*.\n\nLet *G* be a graph with 128 vertices. Let *S* be the set of all possible clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs in *G*. We want to find the maximum possible value for the size of *S*, denoted as |*S*|.\n\n**1. Establishing an Upper Bound**\n\nA clique in a graph with 128 vertices cannot have more than 128 vertices. Therefore, any possible clique size *k* must be an integer between 1 and 128. This means that the set of possible clique sizes *S* for any such graph is a subset of {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}. Consequently, the maximum number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128.\n\n**2. Achieving the Upper Bound**\n\nNow, we need to show that it is possible to construct a graph on 128 vertices that achieves this upper bound of 128 different clique sizes.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted as *K*<sub>128</sub>. In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's examine the induced subgraphs of *K*<sub>128</sub>:\n*   Select any single vertex. The induced subgraph is a *K*<sub>1</sub>. Thus, a clique of size 1 exists.\n*   Select any pair of two vertices. Since every two vertices in *K*<sub>128</sub> are connected, this pair forms a *K*<sub>2</sub>. Thus, a clique of size 2 exists.\n*   In general, for any integer *k* from 1 to 128, select any subset of *k* vertices from *K*<sub>128</sub>. By the definition of a complete graph, every pair of vertices in this subset is connected by an edge. Therefore, the subgraph induced by this subset of *k* vertices is a complete graph *K*<sub>*k*</sub>.\n\nThis shows that the complete graph *K*<sub>128</sub> contains induced cliques of every possible size from 1 to 128. For this graph, the set of different clique sizes is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}. The number of elements in this set is 128.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the number of different clique sizes in a graph with 128 vertices cannot exceed 128, and that the complete graph *K*<sub>128</sub> achieves this number. Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
