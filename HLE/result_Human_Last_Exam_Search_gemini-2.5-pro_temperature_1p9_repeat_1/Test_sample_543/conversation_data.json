    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide in THF followed by an aqueous work-up results in the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nThis reaction is a Grignard cross-coupling reaction. The reactivity of the halogens on the benzene ring towards the Grignard reagent is key to determining the final product. The general order of reactivity for halogens in such nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions is I > Br > Cl > F. The carbon-iodine bond is the weakest and therefore the most reactive site.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in a stepwise manner:\n1.  The first molecule of phenyl magnesium bromide reacts with the most reactive site, the carbon attached to the iodine atom, to replace the iodine and form 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  Because phenyl magnesium bromide is used in *excess*, it will then proceed to react with the less reactive carbon-bromine bonds.\n3.  The two bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 are subsequently replaced by phenyl groups.\n4.  The final organic product after all three halogens have been substituted is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n5.  The aqueous work-up serves to quench any remaining Grignard reagent, converting it to benzene and magnesium salts.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for the resulting product with a central benzene ring substituted with three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
