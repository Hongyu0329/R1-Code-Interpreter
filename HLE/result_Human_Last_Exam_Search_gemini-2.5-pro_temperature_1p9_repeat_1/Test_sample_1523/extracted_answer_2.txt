In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(φ, D_φ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function corresponds to the kinetic part of the Euclidean action. It is expressed as the integral over Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time `τ` integrated from 0 to `β=1/T`) of the field `φ` multiplied by the Klein-Gordon operator acting on `φ`. Explicitly, for a field `φ` with mass `m`, it is given by: `½ ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x φ(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)φ`.
