    "The initial search has provided some general context on finite-temperature field theory and the functional integral representation of the partition function. Specifically, several results mention the \"functional integral representation of the partition function\" as a key topic. However, none of the snippets directly define the inner product in this context or the specific form of `(φ, D_φ)`. To answer the user's question, I need to understand what `D_φ` represents in this context, which is likely the kinetic operator for the scalar field, and how the inner product is defined within the functional integral. This will require a more focused search on the mathematical structure of the functional integral. The next steps should aim to clarify these points.The searches in step 2 provided more specific information. I learned about the imaginary time formalism, where the time integration in the action is Wick-rotated (`τ = it`) and performed over a finite interval `[0, β]`, where `β = 1/T`. The fields are periodic on this interval. I also found that the kinetic part of the action for a real scalar field involves terms like `(∂µφ)²`.  Crucially, several sources point out that the path integral is defined over field configurations, and the action appears in the exponent of the integrand. The quadratic part of the action, which contains the kinetic operator, defines a Gaussian integral. However, the precise definition of the inner product `(φ, D_φ)` is still implicit. I need to explicitly connect the terms in the action to the notation of an inner product. The next steps will focus on formalizing this connection and finding an explicit expression for the inner product.The searches in step 3 provided the crucial pieces of information. I now have the explicit form of the Euclidean action for a scalar field at finite temperature and understand how it relates to the path integral representation of the partition function. The \"inner product\" `(φ, D_φ)` is not a formally defined inner product in the mathematical sense within the physics literature I've found, but rather a physicist's shorthand for the integral of `φ` multiplied by the action of a differential operator `D` on `φ`. The searches confirm that `D_φ` corresponds to the kinetic operator in the Euclidean action. I can now construct the final answer by synthesizing this information.\n\nIn the context of finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the partition function `Z` is expressed through a functional integral over all possible field configurations `φ`. The expression takes the form:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dφ exp(-S_E[φ])`\n\nHere, `Dφ` represents the functional measure, and `S_E[φ]` is the Euclidean action of the scalar field. The theory is formulated in Euclidean spacetime by performing a Wick rotation to imaginary time `τ = it`, where the time integration is over the finite interval `[0, β]` with `β = 1/T` being the inverse temperature. The scalar field `φ` is periodic in imaginary time with period `β`.\n\nThe term `(φ, D_φ)` that you are asking about represents the kinetic part of the Euclidean action. It is not a formal inner product in the strict mathematical sense but a common shorthand notation in physics for the integral of the field `φ` multiplied by the action of a differential operator `D_φ` on `φ`.\n\nThe Euclidean action for a free, neutral scalar field `φ` with mass `m` is given by:\n\n`S_E[φ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x [ ½ (∂_τ φ)² + ½ (∇φ)² + ½ m²φ² ]`\n\nThrough integration by parts, and considering the periodic boundary conditions of the field, the kinetic part of the action can be written as:\n\n`S_E,kin[φ] = ½ ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x φ(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)φ`\n\nTherefore, the operator `D` is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space, `D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`. The notation `(φ, D_φ)` corresponds to the integral of `φ` against `Dφ`, which is a central piece of the Gaussian integral that one solves to find the partition function for the free field.\n\nIn this formalism, the inner product `(φ, D_φ)` is explicitly:\n\n`½ ∫ d⁴x_E φ(x_E) (-∂_μ∂_μ + m²) φ(x_E)`\n\nwhere `x_E = (τ, **x**)`, and the integral is over the Euclidean spacetime with the time dimension compactified to the interval `[0, β]`. This expression is fundamental for calculating propagators and understanding the behavior of the scalar field at finite temperature.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(φ, D_φ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function corresponds to the kinetic part of the Euclidean action. It is expressed as the integral over Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time `τ` integrated from 0 to `β=1/T`) of the field `φ` multiplied by the Klein-Gordon operator acting on `φ`. Explicitly, for a field `φ` with mass `m`, it is given by: `½ ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x φ(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²)φ`.>>>"
