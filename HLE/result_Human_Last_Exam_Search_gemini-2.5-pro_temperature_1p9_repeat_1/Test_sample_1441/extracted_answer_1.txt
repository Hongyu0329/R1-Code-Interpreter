In scalar field theoretical frameworks, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, quantitatively scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, below the upper critical dimension of four primarily through the epsilon-expansion and the hyperscaling relation α = 2 - νd. The epsilon-expansion, where ε = 4 - d, provides a perturbative series for α. To first order (one-loop), for an O(n)-symmetric model, α is given by α = (4-n)/(2(n+8)) * ε. To second order (two-loop), a more complex expression, α = (4-n)/(2(n+8)) * ε - (n+2)²(n+28)/(4(n+8)³) * ε², is obtained. This demonstrates that the scaling is not a simple function of d but depends on the order of the expansion and the number of components of the order parameter, n. For d=3 (ε=1), the values of α are approximately 0.110 for the Ising model (n=1), -0.0146 for the XY model (n=2), and -0.1336 for the Heisenberg model (n=3). In the exactly solvable 2D Ising model (d=2, n=1), α=0, corresponding to a logarithmic divergence.
