The expression for the Electrical double-layer (EDL) potential distribution ψ(y) in the microchannel is:

**ψ(y) = ζ_1(1 + βk) * [sinh(k(H - y)) / sinh(kH)]**

where:
*   `y` is the vertical position from the bottom plate (0 ≤ y ≤ H).
*   `ζ_1` is the base zeta potential of the bottom surface.
*   `β` is the slip length.
*   `k` is the Debye-Hückel parameter.
*   `H` is the height of the microchannel.
*   `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function.
