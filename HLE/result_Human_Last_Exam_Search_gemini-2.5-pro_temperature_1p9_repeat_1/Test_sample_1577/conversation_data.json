    "### Ground Space Degeneracy of the Toric Code with Smooth and Rough Holes\n\nThe ground space degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. For a simple, closed surface without holes, such as a sphere, the ground state is unique (non-degenerate). The introduction of topological features like handles (genus) or holes increases this degeneracy, allowing for the encoding of quantum information.\n\nThe toric code can be defined on a surface with different types of boundaries, commonly referred to as \"smooth\" and \"rough\" boundaries. These boundary conditions dictate which type of excitation (electric or magnetic) can terminate at the boundary. When holes are introduced into the toric code lattice, the edges of these holes act as boundaries.\n\nA key principle in understanding the ground space degeneracy is that each independent, non-contractible loop on the surface gives rise to a logical operator that commutes with the Hamiltonian but may not commute with other such operators. These operators generate the degenerate ground states. For a surface with genus *g* (number of handles), the degeneracy is 4<sup>g</sup>, which corresponds to 2*g* logical qubits.\n\nWhen considering a surface with holes, each hole introduces a new type of non-contractible loop. A loop that encircles a single hole is an example of such a non-contractible loop. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a surface of genus *g* with *b* boundaries (holes are a form of boundary) is given by `k = 2g + b - 1`. For a plane, which has a genus of 0, with one outer boundary and *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes, the total number of boundaries is `b = 1 + n + m`. This would lead to `k = (1 + n + m) - 1 = n + m` logical qubits.\n\nEach of the *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes provides an independent topological degree of freedom.  Each such degree of freedom allows for the encoding of one logical qubit. The distinction between smooth and rough holes determines the type of logical operators (strings of Pauli-X or Pauli-Z operators) that can be defined in relation to them, which is crucial for performing quantum computations, but does not alter the fundamental count of the degeneracy itself. Each hole, regardless of whether it is smooth or rough, contributes a factor of 2 to the total ground space degeneracy.\n\nTherefore, for a toric code with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes, the total ground space degeneracy (GSD) is the product of the degeneracies introduced by each hole:\n\nGSD = 2<sup>(n + m)</sup>\n\nThis corresponds to a total of *n + m* encoded logical qubits.\n\nBased on the provided answer choices, the correct formula is:\nA. 2^(m+n)\n\n<<<A>>>"
