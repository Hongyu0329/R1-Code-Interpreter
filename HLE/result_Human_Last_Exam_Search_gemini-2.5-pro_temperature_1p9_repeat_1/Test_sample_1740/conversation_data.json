    "To date, there is some variation in the exact number of let-7 family members identified in humans, with sources identifying between 10 and 13 members. This variation can be attributed to whether the count refers to mature microRNAs (miRNAs) or their precursor genes.\n\nIn humans, there are 10 recognized mature let-7 miRNAs. These include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202. These mature miRNAs arise from 13 different precursor genes.\n\nThe let-7 family is a highly conserved group of miRNAs across many species. First discovered in *C. elegans*, let-7 was later identified as the first human miRNA. The members of this family are known to be key regulators of cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Dysregulation of the let-7 family has been linked to the development of cancer, where they often act as tumor suppressors. For instance, they are known to regulate the expression of oncogenes like RAS and MYC.\n\n<<<10>>>"
