    "It is not possible to provide a specific number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo scene of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for the Semperoper Ballett in 2015. The reason is that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized, individual ballet step that can be counted.\n\nThe term \"Balanchine technique\" or \"Balanchine method\" refers to a distinct style of ballet developed by the renowned choreographer George Balanchine. This style is characterized by its speed, athleticism, and specific aesthetic qualities. While choreographers and dancers may be influenced by or train in the Balanchine method, individual steps within a ballet are not typically named \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\nWilliam Forsythe's choreographic style, while rooted in classical ballet, is known for its deconstruction and evolution of the traditional vocabulary. His work, including \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" pushes the boundaries of classical technique. The \"Jete Woman\" solo, as performed by Svetlana Gileva with the Semperoper Ballett, is a recognized and notable role within this production.\n\nWhile a video of Svetlana Gileva performing this solo in 2015 exists, it is unfortunately unavailable for viewing. However, even with access to the performance, it would be impossible to enumerate a step that is not part of the standard ballet lexicon. Therefore, the question of how many \"pas de Balanchines\" were performed cannot be factually answered.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a numerical answer to this question as \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized ballet step, but rather a style or technique.>>>"
