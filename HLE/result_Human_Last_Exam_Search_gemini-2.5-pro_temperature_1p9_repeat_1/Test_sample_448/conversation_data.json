    "**Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002, with an estimated abundance of 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram in the Earth's crust and an atmospheric concentration of about 1 x 10<sup>-19</sup> percent.** This incredibly low concentration is due to its radioactive nature and short half-life.\n\nThe abundances of noble gases on Earth vary significantly. While argon is the most plentiful, making up about 0.934% of the atmosphere, others are found in much smaller quantities. The approximate atmospheric abundances of the other noble gases are:\n\n*   **Helium (He):** 0.0005%\n*   **Neon (Ne):** 0.0018%\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** 0.0001%\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** 0.0000087%\n\nRadon (Rn) is continuously formed through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust. However, its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days, meaning it quickly decays into other elements. This rapid decay prevents it from accumulating in any significant quantity, making it the rarest of the noble gases on our planet.\n\nThe extreme rarity and radioactivity of radon mean that its presence is often discussed in terms of its potential health risks rather than its direct applications, which are limited.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
