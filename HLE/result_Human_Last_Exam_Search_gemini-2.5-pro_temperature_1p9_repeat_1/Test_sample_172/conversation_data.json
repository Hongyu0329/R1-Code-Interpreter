    "The correspondence chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted $\\chi_{cp}(G)$ (or $\\chi_{DP}(G)$ for DP-chromatic number), is a generalization of the list chromatic number. For a simple graph, it is known that the correspondence chromatic number of any cycle $C_n$ for $n \\ge 3$ is 3.\n\nThe graph in question is obtained from a 100-cycle, $C_{100}$, by replacing each edge with 1234 parallel edges. Let's call this multigraph $G$.\n\nThe degree of each vertex in $G$ is uniform. For any vertex $v$, it is connected to its two neighbors in the original cycle, but each connection now consists of 1234 edges. Therefore, the degree of each vertex is $d = 2 \\times 1234 = 2468$.\n\nA key theorem for DP-coloring of multigraphs is a generalization of Brooks's Theorem, established by Bernshteyn, Kostochka, and Pron. This theorem states that for a connected multigraph $H$ that is not a complete multigraph or an odd cycle (with single edges), its correspondence chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, i.e., $\\chi_{cp}(H) \\le \\Delta(H)$.\n\nThe graph $G$ is connected. It is based on an even cycle ($C_{100}$), so it is not an odd cycle. It is also not a complete multigraph (a multigraph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by at least one edge). Thus, the generalized Brooks's Theorem for DP-coloring applies to $G$.\nThe maximum degree of $G$ is $\\Delta(G) = 2468$. Therefore, we have an upper bound for the correspondence chromatic number:\n$\\chi_{cp}(G) \\le \\Delta(G) = 2468$.\n\nTo find a lower bound, we can try to construct a scenario where lists of size 2467 are insufficient. Let the list of available colors for each vertex be $L_v = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 2467\\}$.\n\nConsider three consecutive vertices in the cycle, which we label $v_1, v_2, v_3$. The vertices $v_1$ and $v_3$ are not adjacent in $G$. Let's assign the color 1 to both $v_1$ and $v_3$. This is a valid partial coloring.\n\nNow we must color $v_2$, which has a list $L_{v_2} = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 2467\\}$. The vertex $v_2$ is connected to $v_1$ by 1234 parallel edges and to $v_3$ by another 1234 parallel edges.\n\nIn correspondence coloring, each edge has an associated partial matching that specifies forbidden color pairs. To construct a worst-case scenario, we can define these correspondences as follows:\n1.  For the 1234 edges between $v_1$ and $v_2$, we define the correspondences such that the color 1 assigned to $v_1$ forbids the colors $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 1234\\}$ for $v_2$. This is possible because for each color to be forbidden, we can associate it with one of the parallel edges.\n2.  Similarly, for the 1234 edges between $v_3$ and $v_2$, we define the correspondences such that the color 1 assigned to $v_3$ forbids the colors $\\{1235, 1236, \\dots, 2467\\}$ for $v_2$. This range contains $2467 - 1235 + 1 = 1233$ colors.\n\nLet's refine the forbidden colors from $v_3$. To forbid as many distinct colors as possible, we define the correspondences for the edges between $v_2$ and $v_3$ such that the color 1 at $v_3$ forbids the colors $\\{1235, 1236, \\dots, 1235 + 1234 - 1\\} = \\{1235, \\dots, 2468\\}$ at $v_2$.\n\nThe set of all colors forbidden for $v_2$ is the union of the colors forbidden by $v_1$ and the colors forbidden by $v_3$:\nForbidden set = $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 1234\\} \\cup \\{1235, \\dots, 2468\\}$.\nThe colors in our defined lists are integers up to 2467. The subset of the forbidden set that is in $L_{v_2}$ is $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 1234\\} \\cup \\{1235, \\dots, 2467\\}$. The total number of forbidden colors for $v_2$ is $1234 + (2467 - 1235 + 1) = 1234 + 1233 = 2467$.\n\nSince the size of the list $L_{v_2}$ is 2467 and every color in it is forbidden by the choices for its neighbors, $v_2$ cannot be colored. This construction provides a specific assignment of lists of size 2467 and correspondences for which there is no valid coloring.\n\nTherefore, the correspondence chromatic number must be greater than 2467:\n$\\chi_{cp}(G) \\ge 2468$.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds:\n$2468 \\le \\chi_{cp}(G) \\le 2468$.\n\nThis proves that the correspondence chromatic number of the graph is exactly 2468.\n\n<<<2468>>>"
