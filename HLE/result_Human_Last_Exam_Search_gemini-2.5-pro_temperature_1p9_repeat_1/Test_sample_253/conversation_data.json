    "When following the cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1 and applying the rule 20 times, the resulting binary pattern is `110001101101010110111`.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern is governed by the state of a cell and its two immediate neighbors. The name \"Rule 110\" is derived from the binary sequence 01101110, which dictates the outcome for each of the eight possible neighborhood configurations. Specifically, the new state of a central cell is determined as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern | New State for Center Cell |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nStarting with a single '1' surrounded by '0's, the pattern expands and evolves with each iteration. After 20 applications of Rule 110, the specific non-zero binary sequence emerges. This behavior, arising from simple rules, is a hallmark of complex systems, and Rule 110 is notably capable of universal computation.\n\n<<<110001101101010110111>>>"
