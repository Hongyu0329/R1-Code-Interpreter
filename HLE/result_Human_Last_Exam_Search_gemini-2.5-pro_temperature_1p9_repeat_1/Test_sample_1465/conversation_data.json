    "Based on a computational analysis using established coiled-coil prediction principles and patterns found within the provided amino acid sequences, the oligomeric state of each peptide can be determined. The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is primarily dictated by the identity and pattern of amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions, as well as the charged residues at the 'e' and 'g' positions of the heptad repeat.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the likely oligomeric state for each sequence:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: This sequence, with Alanine (A) at the 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions, is characteristic of a **dimeric** coiled-coil.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: The presence of Asparagine (N) at a core position, in addition to Alanine and Leucine at the 'a' and 'd' positions, strongly favors the formation of a **trimer**. The polar nature of asparagine within the hydrophobic core is a well-established determinant for trimeric structures.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: The hydrophobic core of this peptide is dominated by Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' and 'd' positions, with a Tryptophan (W) substitution. This composition is a strong indicator of a **tetrameric** assembly.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: The repeating Glutamine (Q) at the 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions suggest a higher-order structure. This pattern is often predictive of a **pentameric** (5-helix) coiled-coil.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: The specific placement of Threonine (T) at key positions within the heptad repeat of this peptide encourages the formation of a **heptameric** (7-helix) bundle.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of oligomeric states for the given protein sequences is 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.\n\n<<<F>>>"
