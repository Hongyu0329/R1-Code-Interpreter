    "A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the bottleneck edge.\n\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, a node is selected uniformly at random from the entire graph, and then one of its neighbors is chosen uniformly at random for interaction. The probability of sampling a specific edge is determined by the likelihood of either of its endpoints initiating the gossip to the other.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n*   **Graph Structure:** The graph has a total of 10 nodes. It's formed by two 5-node cliques (K5). Let's call them Clique A and Clique B. A single edge, the bottleneck, connects one node from Clique A (let's call it node `u`) to one node from Clique B (let's call it node `v`).\n*   **Node Degrees:** We need to determine the degree of the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Node `u` is connected to the 4 other nodes within its own clique (Clique A) and to node `v` via the bottleneck edge. Therefore, the degree of `u` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, node `v` is connected to the 4 other nodes in Clique B and to node `u`. The degree of `v` is also `4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Gossiping Process:**\n    1.  A node is chosen uniformly at random from the 10 nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/10`.\n    2.  The chosen node then selects one of its neighbors with uniform probability. For a node `i` with degree `d_i`, the probability of choosing any particular neighbor is `1/d_i`.\n*   **Calculating the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if either `u` chooses `v`, or `v` chooses `u`.\n    *   The probability of node `u` being chosen and then selecting `v` is: `P(u is chosen) * P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/degree(u)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   The probability of node `v` being chosen and then selecting `u` is: `P(v is chosen) * P(v chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/degree(v)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\nThe total probability of the bottleneck edge being sampled in a single step is the sum of these two mutually exclusive events:\n`P(bottleneck sampled) = (1/50) + (1/50) = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nTherefore, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25 or 0.04.\n\n<<<0.04>>>"
