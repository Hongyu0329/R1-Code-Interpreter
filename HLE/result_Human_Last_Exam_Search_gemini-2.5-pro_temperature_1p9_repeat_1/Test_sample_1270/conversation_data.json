    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a humorous and metaphorical representation based on the structure of benzene.\n\nBenzene (C₆H₆) is an organic compound composed of six carbon atoms joined in a planar ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each. The name \"mercedesbenzene\" is a pun, visually replacing the circle that represents the delocalized pi electrons in benzene with a shape resembling the three-pointed star of the Mercedes-Benz logo.\n\nTherefore, the underlying carbon skeleton is that of benzene. The \"mercedes\" part of the name does not imply any additional carbon atoms but is merely a stylized representation.\n\nThus, mercedesbenzene would have 6 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<6>>>"
