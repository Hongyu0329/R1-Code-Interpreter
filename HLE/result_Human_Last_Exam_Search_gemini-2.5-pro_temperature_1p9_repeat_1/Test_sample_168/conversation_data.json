    "The sound produced by a sustained human muscle contraction is a low-frequency rumbling noise. Slow-twitch muscle fibers contract at a rate of 10 to 30 times per second, which corresponds to a sound frequency of 10 to 30 Hz. Fast-twitch fibers contract at 30 to 70 Hz. This range of sound is mostly in the infrasound spectrum (below 20 Hz), which is below the typical hearing range for humans.\n\nOf the animals listed, the herring is the most likely to be able to detect such a sound. Here's a breakdown of the hearing abilities of each animal:\n\n*   **Herring (C):** The herring family has a specialized hearing system that makes them sensitive to a wide range of frequencies, including infrasound down to 5 Hz. Their swim bladder is connected to their inner ear, which significantly enhances their ability to detect sound pressure, making them \"hearing specialists\". This allows them to perceive very faint, low-frequency sounds, an adaptation that helps them detect predators by the sound of their muscle movements before an attack.\n\n*   **Whale (D):** Many baleen whales, such as blue and fin whales, can produce and hear very low-frequency sounds, including infrasonic signals below 20 Hz. These sounds are used for communication over vast ocean distances. While they are capable of hearing in the right frequency range, the literature more specifically points to the herring's adaptation for detecting faint predator sounds.\n\n*   **Dog (A):** While dogs have a wider hearing range than humans, particularly at high frequencies, their low-frequency hearing is similar to that of humans. They are not known to be particularly sensitive to infrasound.\n\n*   **Bat (B):** Bats are experts in using high-frequency ultrasound (sounds above the range of human hearing) for echolocation to hunt and navigate. They are not adapted to hear low-frequency infrasound.\n\n*   **Human (E):** The standard range of human hearing is 20 to 20,000 Hz. The low-frequency sound of a muscle twitch, which can be as low as 10 Hz, is generally inaudible to humans without amplification.\n\n<<<C>>>"
