    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation in the large $x$ regimes, we first analyze the equation:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large values of $x$, we look for the dominant terms that dictate the behavior of the solution. The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ will decay provided that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$. The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x) + 1}$ is an oscillatory term with singularities, which complicates a straightforward asymptotic analysis. However, in the context of finding a simplified approximate form for the underlying trend of the solution, we can analyze the behavior of the equation by comparing the other terms.\n\nLet's assume a solution of the form $y(x) \\approx c x^a$. We substitute this into the equation to find the dominant balance between the terms.\n*   $y''' \\sim x^{a-3}$\n*   $y^4 \\sim x^{4a}$\n*   $y'^4 \\sim x^{4(a-1)}$\n*   $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2} \\sim x^{a-4}$\n\nComparing the powers, the term $y^4$ (with exponent $4a$) will dominate $y'^4$ (with exponent $4a-4$) for any value of $a$ and large $x$. If the solution were to grow (i.e., $a > 0$), the dominant term would be $y^4$. Balancing $y''' \\approx y^4$ leads to $a-3 = 4a$, which gives $a=-1$. This contradicts the assumption of a growing solution.\n\nTherefore, we must consider a decaying solution where $y \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. In this case, $a < 0$. If $a < 0$, then all terms involving $y$ and its derivatives go to zero as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x) + 1}$ does not decay. A formal analysis including this term is complex, as the solution would exhibit oscillatory behavior and potential singularities not captured by a simple power-law approximation.\n\nA common approach in such problems is to find the fundamental underlying behavior by omitting the complex oscillatory forcing terms. This provides an approximation of the average or \"backbone\" solution. By neglecting the oscillatory term and the smaller higher-derivative terms, a dominant balance analysis suggests that $y'''$ and $y^4$ are the most significant terms for a decaying solution when $a=-1$.\n\nEstablishing the simplified equation $y''' \\approx y^4$, we can find the coefficient $c$ for our assumed solution form $y(x) = cx^{-1}$.\n*   $y'(x) = -cx^{-2}$\n*   $y''(x) = 2cx^{-3}$\n*   $y'''(x) = -6cx^{-4}$\n\nSubstituting these into the simplified equation:\n$-6cx^{-4} = (cx^{-1})^4 = c^4x^{-4}$\n\nThis implies $-6c = c^4$, which simplifies to $c(c^3 + 6) = 0$. This yields two real solutions: the trivial solution $c=0$ and $c^3 = -6$, which gives $c = -\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nUsing the non-trivial solution, we get the leading-order asymptotic behavior of $y(x)$:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\sqrt{6} x^{-1}$\n\nTo provide the answer with coefficients rounded to two decimal places, we calculate the value of $c$:\n$c = -\\sqrt{6} \\approx -1.81712$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $c \\approx -1.82$.\nThus, the analytical expression that approximates the solution in the large $x$ regimes is:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\frac{1.82}{x}$\n\n<<<y(x) = -1.82/x>>>"
