    "While no Beatles song starts with a direct chord jump from the tonic to a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale (a 'v' chord), the song that most closely fits the description of an unusual opening chord change involving a minor quality is **\"If I Fell.\"**\n\nThe introduction to \"If I Fell\" begins on an E-flat minor chord and then moves to a D major chord. This immediate and unexpected chromatic shift from a minor chord down a semitone to a major chord is a distinctive feature of the song. While the initial E-flat minor is not the tonic of the song's main key (which is D major), it functions as the starting point of the introductory phrase, creating a memorable and harmonically complex opening.\n\nThe song is known for its intricate chord progression, particularly in the introduction, which has been a subject of music theory analysis. The progression is tonally ambiguous, and the first chord's relationship to the rest of the song makes it a prime example of the Beatles' innovative songwriting.\n\nOther songs by The Beatles with notably complex or unusual chord progressions include \"I Am the Walrus,\" which features a series of major chords in its introduction, \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" with its dreamlike and modulating harmony, and \"You Never Give Me Your Money,\" which contains numerous key and time signature changes. However, none of these begin with the specific chord movement described in the question.\n\nTherefore, \"If I Fell\" is the most likely answer due to its prominent and unconventional opening chord change that starts on a minor chord.\n\n<<<If I Fell>>>"
