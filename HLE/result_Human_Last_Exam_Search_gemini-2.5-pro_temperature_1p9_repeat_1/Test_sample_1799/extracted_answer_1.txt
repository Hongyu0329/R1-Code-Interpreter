It is not true that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first postulate alone. While the first postulate, when combined with other assumptions such as the homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime or the universal validity of Maxwell's equations, can lead to the existence of an invariant speed, it does not by itself single out this conclusion. The second postulate serves as a crucial piece of physical input, grounded in experimental observation, that specifies the nature of spacetime transformations and identifies the invariant speed as the speed of light. Therefore, in the standard formulation of special relativity, the second postulate is a necessary component.
