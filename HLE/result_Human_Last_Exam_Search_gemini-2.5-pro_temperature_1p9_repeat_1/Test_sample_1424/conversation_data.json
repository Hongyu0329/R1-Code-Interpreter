    "<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀, which describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle, has a distinct functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ. When transformed from the time domain to the frequency (or energy) domain, this dependence becomes explicit and simple.\n\nIn the frequency-momentum (ω, k) representation, the bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) is a scalar function for each wavevector k. Its value is given by the inverse of a simple expression involving the frequency and the corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ.\n\nThe general form is:\n\nG₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ)\n\nHere:\n*   **ω** represents the frequency (energy) variable.\n*   **ϵₖ** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with wavevector k.\n*   **δ** is an infinitesimal positive real number that ensures the causality of the Green's function. Depending on the specific type of Green's function (retarded, advanced, or time-ordered), the sign of iδ and its position relative to the real axis may change, but the core dependence on ω and ϵₖ remains.\n\nThis relationship demonstrates that the poles, or singularities, of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In other words, for a given momentum k, the Green's function diverges when the energy ω of the propagating particle matches its allowed energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. The imaginary part of the Green's function is peaked at the accessible energies of the free particle. This connection is fundamental, as it shows how the spectrum of a non-interacting system is encoded within its propagator.\n\nThis expression can be derived by performing a Gaussian path integral over the non-interacting action of the system. The result of this integration shows that the propagator, or Green's function, is the inverse of the operator that appears in the quadratic part of the action, which in the frequency-momentum basis is simply (ω - ϵₖ).>>>"
