The immediate management for this patient would involve cleaning the avulsed tooth sockets and suturing any lacerations, accompanied by antibiotics and analgesics, given that replantation is not feasible after 28 hours. The cells of primary interest are those involved in wound healing, such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts, as the critical periodontal ligament cells for replantation are no longer viable. For prosthetic replacement, an immediate flexible removable partial denture made of polyamide material would be appropriate. The abutment teeth for this Kennedy Class III situation would be the left central incisor and the left second premolar.
