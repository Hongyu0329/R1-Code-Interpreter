The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is:
Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ e⁻ˢᴱ[ψ̄,ψ]
where the integral is over all anti-periodic Grassmann fields ψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ) and ψ̄(x, τ + β) = -ψ̄(x, τ). The term S_E represents the Euclidean action of the fermionic system, given by S_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x L_E, with L_E being the Euclidean Lagrangian density.
