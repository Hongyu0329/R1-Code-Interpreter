    "To determine the central pixel of a line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, a sequence of pixels that form the line must be generated. Bresenham's algorithm is a method for drawing lines on a grid of pixels, using integer arithmetic to efficiently determine the closest pixel to the true line at each step.\n\nFor the given line, the change in x (Δx) is 10 (11 - 1), and the change in y (Δy) is 4 (5 - 1). Since Δx is greater than Δy, the algorithm will increment the x-coordinate at each step and decide whether to increment the y-coordinate based on a decision parameter.\n\nThe sequence of pixels generated by the algorithm is as follows:\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   (6, 3)\n*   (7, 3)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 4)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in this sequence. The central pixel is the one in the middle of this sequence, which is the 6th pixel.\n\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<**(6, 3)**>>>"
