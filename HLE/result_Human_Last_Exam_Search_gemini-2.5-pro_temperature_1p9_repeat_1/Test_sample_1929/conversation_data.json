    "The reaction between butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a dienophile) is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as the Diels-Alder reaction. In this reaction, a six-membered ring is formed.\n\nThe product of this specific reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   Butadiene (CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂) contributes four pi-electrons.\n*   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂) contributes two pi-electrons.\n*   These six pi-electrons rearrange to form a new six-membered ring with a double bond.\n\nThe resulting structure is a cyclohexene ring where the carbon atom that was bonded to the two chlorine atoms in the ethene molecule is now part of the ring, and the same applies to the carbon atom bonded to the two fluorine atoms. The search results confirm that 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene readily undergoes cycloaddition reactions with dienes like butadiene. This type of reaction is a well-established method for forming cyclic compounds.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
