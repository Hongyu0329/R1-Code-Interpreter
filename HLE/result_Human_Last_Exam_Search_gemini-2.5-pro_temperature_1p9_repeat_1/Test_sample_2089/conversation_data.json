    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed as they board a bus is likely a partially misremembered scene from either ***Ghost World*** (2001) or ***Midnight Cowboy*** (1969).\n\nWhile neither film features the explicit dialogue of a character saying \"Thank you\" and sealing their fate in that exact manner, both have pivotal and somber bus scenes that are central to the film's conclusion.\n\nIn the final scene of **Ghost World**, the protagonist, Enid, boards a bus at a stop that was previously marked as \"Not in Service\". This moment is ambiguous, with some viewers interpreting it as a metaphor for her suicide, though the film's creators have suggested it represents her moving on to an unknown future. Enid's decision to get on the bus marks a definitive end to her life as she knows it, thus sealing her fate in a symbolic way. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nSimilarly, the classic film **Midnight Cowboy** concludes with a tragic bus scene. The two main characters, Joe Buck and \"Ratso\" Rizzo, are on a bus to Florida when Ratso's health, which has been declining throughout the film, takes a turn for the worse, and he dies during the journey. Earlier in the film, a minor character says \"thank you\" to Joe on a bus, but the pivotal and fatal bus scene does not contain this line. *Midnight Cowboy* won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nIt is highly probable that the scene you are recalling is from one of these two acclaimed films, with the specific dialogue of \"Thank you\" being a detail that has been slightly altered in memory.\n\n<<<*Ghost World* or *Midnight Cowboy*>>>"
