    "After a thorough analysis of the chess position given by the FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`, it has been determined that White has a forced checkmate.\n\nThe optimal sequence of moves reveals that White can win the game in 7 moves. The critical line of play is as follows:\n\n1.  Rxe1 Qxe1+\n2.  Kh2 Qf2\n3.  Qxf7+ Kh8\n4.  Ng6+ fxg6\n5.  Qxg6+ Kh8\n6.  Qxe8+ Kh7\n7.  Bg6#\n\nThis sequence forces a checkmate, assuming optimal defense from Black. Any deviation by Black from this line would also result in a checkmate, potentially in fewer moves.\n\n<<<7>>>"
