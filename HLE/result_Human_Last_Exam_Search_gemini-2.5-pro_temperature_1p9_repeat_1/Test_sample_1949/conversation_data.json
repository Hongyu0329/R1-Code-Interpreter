    "### The Three Longest Rivers Mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid\n\nThe epic poem, the Aeneid, written by Virgil in the 1st century BC, mentions several rivers, both real and mythological. Among the real-world rivers, three stand out for their considerable length. These rivers are the Aras (ancient Araxes), the Tiber, and the Aufidus (modern Ofanto).\n\nThe longest of these is the **Aras River**, known in antiquity as the Araxes. This river, which flows through modern-day Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran, has a total length of approximately 1,072 kilometers (666 miles). In the Aeneid, the Araxes is mentioned in the context of the vast and distant lands that Rome is destined to rule.\n\nThe second longest is the **Tiber River** (Latin: *Tiberis*), the third-longest river in Italy. It flows for about 406 kilometers (252 miles) from the Apennine Mountains to the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Tiber is central to the narrative of the Aeneid, as it is on its banks that Aeneas and his Trojan followers are fated to found a new city, which will eventually become Rome. The river god, Tiberinus, appears to Aeneas in a dream to reassure him that he has reached his destined home.\n\nThe third longest real-world river mentioned is the **Aufidus**, now known as the **Ofanto**. This river in southern Italy has a length of about 170 kilometers (106 miles). It is mentioned by Virgil in the context of the regions of Italy that will be involved in the conflict between the Trojans and the Latins.\n\nIt is worth noting that Virgil also includes the **Eridanus** in the Aeneid, which is often identified with the real-world **Po River**, Italy's longest river at 652 kilometers. However, in the epic, Virgil places the Eridanus in the underworld, not as a river in the mortal world. Additionally, the Aeneid famously features several purely mythological rivers of the Greek and Roman underworld, such as the Styx, Acheron, Phlegethon, and Cocytus, which do not have measurable lengths.\n\n<<<The three longest real-world rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Aras (Araxes), the Tiber, and the Aufidus (Ofanto).>>>"
