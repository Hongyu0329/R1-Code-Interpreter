    "### Solution for the Common Eigenvalues of J² and Jz for a p-electron\n\nIn a spin-orbit coupling problem, the orbital angular momentum (**L**) and the spin angular momentum (**S**) of an electron combine to form a total angular momentum (**J**). For a p-electron, the determination of the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared operator (J²) and its z-component (Jz) is a fundamental application of angular momentum theory in quantum mechanics.\n\n#### Defining the Quantum Numbers\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1. As an electron, its spin angular momentum quantum number is *s* = 1/2. The total angular momentum operator is given by **J** = **L** + **S**. The quantum number *j* for the total angular momentum can take values ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s*.\n\nFor a p-electron:\n*   *l* = 1\n*   *s* = 1/2\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number *j* are:\n*   *j* = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   *j* = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\n#### Eigenvalues of J² and Jz\n\nThe eigenvalues of the J² and Jz operators are determined by the quantum numbers *j* and *m_j* respectively, where *m_j* is the total magnetic quantum number. The eigenvalues are given by:\n*   Eigenvalue of J² = ħ² *j*(*j* + 1)\n*   Eigenvalue of Jz = ħ *m_j*\n\nThe possible values for *m_j* range from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\n#### Determining the Common Eigenvalues\n\nWe can now determine the pairs of common eigenvalues for each possible value of *j*:\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of J² is ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = **(15/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m_j* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. This leads to the following eigenvalues for Jz:\n    *   **-3/2 ħ**\n    *   **-1/2 ħ**\n    *   **1/2 ħ**\n    *   **3/2 ħ**\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of J² is ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = **(3/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m_j* are -1/2 and 1/2. This leads to the following eigenvalues for Jz:\n    *   **-1/2 ħ**\n    *   **1/2 ħ**\n\n#### Summary of Common Eigenvalues\n\nThe common eigenvalues for the J² and Jz operators for a p-electron are the following pairs:\n\n*   For the *j* = 3/2 states, the J² eigenvalue is **(15/4)ħ²** with Jz eigenvalues of **±1/2 ħ** and **±3/2 ħ**.\n*   For the *j* = 1/2 states, the J² eigenvalue is **(3/4)ħ²** with Jz eigenvalues of **±1/2 ħ**.\n\nThese eigenvalues represent the quantized values that would be measured for the total angular momentum squared and the z-component of the total angular momentum for a p-electron under spin-orbit coupling."
