An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product X × Y × Z such that x = F(x, y, z), y = G(y, x, y), and z = H(z, y, x). The existence of such a point is guaranteed under specific conditions, typically within the framework of partially ordered metric spaces. These conditions ensure that iterative sequences generated by the functions converge to the desired fixed point.

### 1. Properties of the Spaces
The sets X, Y, and Z are generally required to be partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means that in addition to being metric spaces with a notion of distance, they are also equipped with a partial order relation (≤). The completeness of the metric spaces is crucial for ensuring that Cauchy sequences, which are constructed in the proof of the existence theorems, converge to a point within the space.

### 2. Mixed Monotone Property
The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. This property establishes a relationship between the ordering of the elements in the input spaces and the ordering of the output. While the specific definition can vary slightly between different theoretical frameworks, it generally implies that the functions are non-decreasing in some arguments and non-increasing in others. For the given functions, a possible mixed monotone property could be defined as follows:

*   **For F(x, y, z):**
    *   F is monotone non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (x and z).
    *   F is monotone non-increasing in its second argument (y).
*   **For G(y, x, y):**
    *   G is monotone non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (both y).
    *   G is monotone non-increasing in its second argument (x).
*   **For H(z, y, x):**
    *   H is monotone non-decreasing in its first argument (z).
    *   H is monotone non-increasing in its second and third arguments (y and x).

### 3. Contractive Condition
The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive-type condition. This condition ensures that the distances between successive elements of the iterative sequences decrease, leading to convergence. An example of such a condition for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which the inequalities in the mixed monotone property hold is:

d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * (d(x, u) + d(y, v) + d(z, w))

where `d` is the metric on the respective spaces and `k` is a constant such that 0 ≤ k < 1. More complex contractive conditions involving functions that are not necessarily linear are also common in the literature.

### 4. Existence of an Initial Point
There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies a specific ordering relationship with the output of the functions. This is often referred to as the existence of a "lower" or "upper" solution. For instance, the condition could be:

x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀).

This initial point serves as the starting point for constructing the iterative sequences that converge to the tripled fixed point.

### 5. Continuity or Regularity
In some versions of the existence theorems, the functions F, G, and H are required to be continuous. However, this condition can often be relaxed and replaced by a weaker condition on the partially ordered metric space, sometimes referred to as "regularity". A space is regular if for any convergent monotonic sequence, the limit of the sequence maintains the same ordering relationship with the elements of the sequence.

In summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is established by showing that under the conditions of a complete partially ordered metric space, a mixed monotone property, a contractive condition, and the presence of an initial ordered point, the iterative sequences generated by F, G, and H are monotonic, form a Cauchy sequence, and converge to a point that is the FGH-tripled fixed point. For a more detailed and precise statement of the conditions, consulting specific papers on FGH-tripled fixed points is recommended, as the exact requirements may vary.
