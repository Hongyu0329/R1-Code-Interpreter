    "The surname of the English poet mentioned in the Russian translation of a specific essay about Vienna's wide boulevards is **Burns**.\n\nThis is a well-known trivia question that relies on a pun accessible in the Russian language. The essay in question is by the Hungarian writer Dezső Kosztolányi. In his description of the Vienna Ringstrasse, a major boulevard, he refers to the paving stones or setts.\n\nIn the Russian translation of the essay, the word used for these paving stones is \"брусчатка\" (bruschatka). The sound of this word is phonetically similar to the surname of the Scottish poet Robert **Burns**, which is spelled \"Бёрнс\" in Russian. In the context of foreign literature, a Scottish poet like Burns is often broadly categorized as \"English.\"\n\n<<<Burns>>>"
