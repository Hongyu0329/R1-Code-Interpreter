    "A \"continuum\" is a nonempty, compact, connected metric space. A continuum with more than one point is called nondegenerate. The \"composant\" of a point p in a continuum X is the set of all points x in X such that there is a proper subcontinuum of X containing both p and x.\n\nFor a decomposable continuum, which can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua, the number of composants is either one or three. An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. For a metrizable indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is c, the cardinality of the continuum of real numbers. There exist non-metrizable indecomposable continua with one or two composants.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of two nondegenerate continua, X and Y. The product of two continua is a continuum. Let Cx be the set of composants of X and Cy be the set of composants of Y. We are looking for the maximum possible number of composants of the product space X x Y.\n\nLet Kx be the number of composants of X and Ky be the number of composants of Y. The composants of the product space X × Y are the products of the composants of X and the composants of Y. If C_i is a composant of X and D_j is a composant of Y, then C_i x D_j is a composant of X x Y. Thus, the number of composants of X x Y is the product of the number of composants of X and the number of composants of Y, which is Kx * Ky.\n\nTo maximize this product, we should maximize the number of composants of each of the individual continua. Since we are dealing with metric spaces (as per the definition of a continuum), the largest number of composants for a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum is 'c' (the cardinality of the real numbers). Let's choose X and Y to be two such continua.\n\nThen, the number of composants of X is c, and the number of composants of Y is c. The number of composants of the product X x Y would be c * c. Since 'c' represents an infinite cardinality, the product c * c is equal to c.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the largest *possible* number. Let's reconsider the nature of composants in product spaces.\n\nLet X and Y be two nondegenerate continua.\n- If both X and Y are decomposable, they can each have 1 or 3 composants. The product X x Y can have 1*1=1, 1*3=3, 3*1=3, or 3*3=9 composants.\n- If one is decomposable and the other is indecomposable, say X is decomposable and Y is indecomposable. X can have 1 or 3 composants, and Y has c composants. The product can have c or 3c = c composants.\n- If both X and Y are indecomposable, they each have c composants. The product X x Y has c * c = c composants.\n\nIt appears the largest number of composants is 'c'. Let's verify this. A composant of a product X×Y is of the form C×D, where C is a composant of X and D is a composant of Y. Let Comp(Z) denote the set of composants of a space Z. Then Comp(X×Y) = {C×D | C ∈ Comp(X), D ∈ Comp(Y)}. The cardinality of Comp(X×Y) is |Comp(X)| × |Comp(Y)|.\n\nLet X and Y be two bucket-handle continua (a type of indecomposable continuum). Each has 'c' composants. Then the product X×Y has c × c = c composants.\n\nIs it possible to have a continuum with more than 'c' composants? A metrizable indecomposable continuum has 'c' composants. What if the continuum is not metrizable? The problem states a continuum is a compact connected *metric* space, so we are restricted to metrizable continua. Therefore, the maximum number of composants for a single continuum is c.\n\nLet's carefully re-read the sources. S. Mazurkiewicz showed that a metric indecomposable continuum has 'c' composants. It is a well-known result that the cardinality of the set of composants of a nondegenerate metrizable indecomposable continuum is that of the real line.\n\nThe number of composants of the product of two continua is the product of the number of composants of each. If we take two nondegenerate indecomposable continua, each will have *c* composants. The product of their composants will be *c* * *c* = *c*.\n\nThe question asks for the largest *possible* number. While 'c' is the cardinality of the continuum, let's consider if a different combination of continua might yield a different result.\n- If X is an arc (1 composant) and Y is the bucket handle (c composants), the product has 1 * c = c composants.\n- If X is a triod (3 composants) and Y is the bucket handle (c composants), the product has 3 * c = c composants.\n- If both X and Y are bucket handle continua (c composants each), the product has c * c = c composants.\n\nIn all cases involving an indecomposable continuum, the answer is 'c'. What if both are decomposable?\n- If X and Y are triods (each having 3 composants), the product X x Y has 3 * 3 = 9 composants.\n\nThis gives a finite number. 'c' is a much larger number.\n\nLet's double-check the initial premise that the composants of the product are the products of the composants. A composant of a continuum Z containing a point z is the union of all proper subcontinua of Z containing z.\nLet (x,y) be a point in X x Y. Let C(x) be the composant of x in X and C(y) be the composant of y in Y. The composant of (x,y) in X x Y is the union of all proper subcontinua of X x Y containing (x,y).\n\nA proper subcontinuum of X x Y containing (x,y) is a subset K of X x Y that is a continuum, K ≠ X x Y, and (x,y) ∈ K.\nLet Kx be a proper subcontinuum of X containing x, and Ky be a proper subcontinuum of Y containing y. Then Kx x Ky is a subcontinuum of X x Y containing (x,y). If either Kx ≠ X or Ky ≠ Y, then Kx x Ky is a proper subcontinuum of X x Y.\n\nThe composant of (x,y) is the union of all such K. It seems that the composant of (x,y) is indeed C(x) x C(y). Let's assume this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of composants of X x Y is the product of the number of composants of X and the number of composants of Y. To maximize this, we need to choose X and Y to be continua with the maximum possible number of composants.\n\nWithin the realm of metrizable continua, an indecomposable continuum has the most composants, which is *c*, the cardinality of the continuum. Let X and Y both be indecomposable continua (e.g., the bucket handle or the pseudo-arc).\n- Number of composants of X = c\n- Number of composants of Y = c\n- Number of composants of X x Y = c * c = c.\n\nThis seems to be the largest possible number. If there were a specific finite number as the answer, there would have to be a theorem limiting the number of composants in a product space, or a different understanding of how composants behave under products. The search results support the idea that for indecomposable metric continua, the number of composants is c. The cardinality of the cartesian product of two sets with cardinality c is also c.\n\nLet's explore if there's any ambiguity in the term \"number\". Usually in this context, it would refer to the cardinality of the set of composants.\nIt's worth re-investigating the number of composants for decomposable continua. A decomposable continuum has either one or three composants. Let's see why. If a continuum M is decomposable, it's the union of two proper subcontinua H and K. The number of composants depends on the structure of the set of points E_M where M is not decomposable into two continua each containing the point. If E_M is empty, M has one composant. If E_M is not connected, M has three composants. If E_M is a connected proper subset, it gets more complex, but leads back to these possibilities for decomposable continua.\n\nSo for decomposable continua, the maximum number of composants is 3.\nX decomposable -> max 3 composants.\nY decomposable -> max 3 composants.\nX x Y -> max 9 composants.\n\nFor an indecomposable continuum (which must be metrizable as per the question's definition), the number of composants is 'c'.\nX indecomposable -> c composants.\nY indecomposable -> c composants.\nX x Y -> c * c = c composants.\n\nThe comparison is between 9 and 'c'. 'c' is the cardinality of the real numbers, which is an uncountable infinity, far greater than 9.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants is c.\nI need to be very sure that \"composants of the product are the products of the composants\".\nLet C(z) denote the set of composants of a continuum Z. We want to determine the cardinality of C(X x Y). Let (x,y) be a point in X x Y. The composant of (x,y), denoted K(x,y), is the union of all proper subcontinua of X x Y containing (x,y).\nLet Cx be the composant of x in X and Cy be the composant of y in Y. We claim K(x,y) = Cx x Cy.\n\nA point (p,q) is in Cx x Cy if and only if p is in Cx and q is in Cy.\nIf p is in Cx, there exists a proper subcontinuum H of X containing x and p.\nIf q is in Cy, there exists a proper subcontinuum K of Y containing y and q.\nThen H x K is a subcontinuum of X x Y containing (x,y) and (p,q). If H is a proper subcontinuum of X, then H x Y is a proper subcontinuum of X x Y. Similarly, if K is a proper subcontinuum of Y, then X x K is a proper subcontinuum of X x Y.\nAny point (p,q) in Cx x Cy is in H x K for some proper subcontinua H containing x,p and K containing y,q. H x K is a subcontinuum of X x Y containing (x,y). It is a proper subcontinuum unless H=X and K=Y, but H and K are proper. Thus (p,q) is in the composant of (x,y). So Cx x Cy is a subset of K(x,y).\n\nConversely, let (p,q) be in the composant K(x,y). Then there is a proper subcontinuum L of X x Y containing (x,y) and (p,q). Let π_X: X x Y -> X and π_Y: X x Y -> Y be the projection maps. Then π_X(L) and π_Y(L) are subcontinua of X and Y, respectively. Since L is a proper subcontinuum of X x Y, either π_X(L) is a proper subcontinuum of X or π_Y(L) is a proper subcontinuum of Y. If both were not proper, then π_X(L) = X and π_Y(L) = Y. This does not imply L = X x Y, but L is contained in π_X(L) x π_Y(L) = X x Y. If π_X(L) is a proper subcontinuum of X, then since x, p are in π_X(L), p is in the composant of x. If π_Y(L) is a proper subcontinuum of Y, then since y,q are in π_Y(L), q is in the composant of y. At least one of these must be true.\nLet's take two indecomposable continua X and Y. Each has c composants. Then the set of composants of X is {C_i | i in I} and of Y is {D_j | j in J}, with |I|=|J|=c. The product X x Y is a continuum. For any (i,j) in I x J, the set C_i x D_j is a composant of X x Y. Since the composants of an indecomposable continuum are disjoint, if (i,j) is not equal to (i', j'), then C_i x D_j and C_i' x D_j' are disjoint. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the pairs of composants (one from each space) and the composants of the product space. The number of such pairs is c * c = c.\n\nFinal check, is it possible for a continuum to have more than 'c' composants? A metrizable space is second-countable. A known result states that any indecomposable metric continuum has c composants.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of composants is obtained when at least one of the continua is indecomposable. The answer should be c.A \"continuum\" is defined as a nonempty, compact, connected metric space. A continuum that consists of more than one point is termed \"nondegenerate\". The \"composant\" of a point within a continuum is the union of all proper subcontinua that contain that point.\n\nThe number of composants of a product of two continua, say X and Y, is the product of the number of composants of X and the number of composants of Y. To find the largest possible number of composants for the product, we must find the maximum possible number of composants for a single nondegenerate continuum.\n\nFor a metrizable indecomposable continuum (a continuum that cannot be represented as the union of two of its proper subcontinua), the number of composants is c, which is the cardinality of the continuum (the set of real numbers). The definition of a continuum in the question specifies a metric space, so we are within the realm where this result applies.\n\nIf we consider decomposable continua, they can have either one or three composants. If we take the product of two such continua, the maximum number of composants would be 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nHowever, if we take at least one indecomposable continuum, the number of composants becomes c. For instance:\n-   The product of a decomposable continuum (with, at most, 3 composants) and an indecomposable continuum (with c composants) would have 3 * c = c composants.\n-   The product of two indecomposable continua, each having c composants, would have c * c = c composants.\n\nSince c (the cardinality of the real numbers) is an uncountable infinity and thus vastly larger than 9, the largest possible number of composants is achieved when at least one of the continua is indecomposable.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is c, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
