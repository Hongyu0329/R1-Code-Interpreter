    "The problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. This is a known problem in the field of convex geometry.\n\nA simple convex domain that satisfies the condition is the square defined by `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`. This square has vertices at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1), and its area is 2. To verify it intersects all the specified lines, one can check its support function, which must be greater than or equal to 1 for all coprime integer pairs (p, q). The support function for this square is `h(p, q) = max(|p|, |q|)`. Since p and q are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero, so `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. Therefore, this square intersects all the lines.\n\nAnother simple case is the unit circle, x² + y² ≤ 1. Its area is π, which is approximately 3.14. Its support function is `h(p, q) = sqrt(p² + q²)`, which is also greater than or equal to 1 for all coprime integers (p, q).\n\nWhile the square with area 2 is a valid solution, it is not the one with the minimal area. This problem was a conjecture by the Polish mathematician Andrzej Schinzel and was later proven. The minimal area of such a convex domain is 4/3. The shape of this domain is not a simple polygon but is bounded by curves.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where p and q are coprime integers, is 4/3.\n\n<<<4/3>>>"
