    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Reaction Details:\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a phosphorus ylide (a Wittig reagent). In this specific reaction, the reactants are:\n\n1.  **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal. Its structure features a tert-butyl group attached to a carbonyl group: `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`.\n2.  **Ylide:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure `(o-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(Ph)₃`.\n\nThe reaction proceeds by replacing the carbonyl oxygen atom of the pivalaldehyde with the `(o-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=` fragment from the ylide. This forms a new carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in the alkene product and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\n### Product Structure:\n\nThe resulting alkene has the following structure:\n`(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)`\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Stereochemistry:\n\nThe Wittig reagent in this reaction, `(o-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(Ph)₃`, is classified as a semi-stabilized ylide because the ylidic carbon is adjacent to a phenyl group. Wittig reactions involving semi-stabilized ylides often result in a mixture of (E) and (Z) stereoisomers of the alkene, with selectivity typically being poor under standard conditions. Therefore, the reaction is expected to produce a mixture of (E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene and (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
