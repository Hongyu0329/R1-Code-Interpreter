    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations (cos(at), sin(bt)) can be determined by analyzing the properties of the frequencies 'a' and 'b'. In this specific case, the curve is given by (cos(9t), sin(5t)), which is a type of Lissajous curve with frequencies a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nLissajous curves are of the general form x = A sin(at + δ) and y = B sin(bt). For the given curve, A=1, B=1, δ=π/2, a=9, and b=5. The number of self-intersections is dependent on the ratio of the frequencies and whether they are odd or even.\n\nWhen the frequencies 'a' and 'b' are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the curve is a single, closed path. Both 9 and 5 are odd integers and they are coprime. For Lissajous curves where both frequencies are odd and coprime, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2.\n\nThis formula applies to curves of the form (cos(at), cos(bt)) or (sin(at), sin(bt)). The use of a mix of sine and cosine functions introduces a phase shift, but it does not alter the number of self-intersection points. A phase shift can be absorbed into the phase parameter, effectively translating the intersection points without changing their total number.\n\nApplying the formula to the given curve with a = 9 and b = 5:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nTherefore, the curve consisting of all points (cos(9t), sin(5t)) has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
