    "To find the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state, we must evaluate the integral of the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over this interval.\n\n**1. The Wave Function and Probability Density**\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the n=2 state, the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, |ψ₂(x)|², is therefore:\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\n**2. The Probability Integral**\n\nThe probability (P) of finding the particle between x₁ = 0.495a and x₂ = 0.505a is calculated by the following integral:\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2.\nHere, θ = 2πx/a, so 2θ = 4πx/a.\n\nThe integral becomes:\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [ (1 - cos(4πx/a))/2 ] dx\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/a) * (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n\n**3. Solving the Integral**\n\nNow, we find the antiderivative of the integrand:\n∫ (1/a) * (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] = x/a - sin(4πx/a)/(4π)\n\nNext, we evaluate this antiderivative at the limits of the interval (x = 0.495a and x = 0.505a):\n\n*   At x = 0.505a:\n    `0.505a/a - sin(4π(0.505a)/a)/(4π) = 0.505 - sin(2.02π)/(4π)`\n*   At x = 0.495a:\n    `0.495a/a - sin(4π(0.495a)/a)/(4π) = 0.495 - sin(1.98π)/(4π)`\n\nNow, subtract the value at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit:\nP = [0.505 - sin(2.02π)/(4π)] - [0.495 - sin(1.98π)/(4π)]\nP = (0.505 - 0.495) - [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] / (4π)\nP = 0.01 - [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] / (4π)\n\nUsing the trigonometric identities sin(2π + α) = sin(α) and sin(2π - α) = -sin(α):\n*   sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\n*   sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstitute these back into the expression for P:\nP = 0.01 - [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))] / (4π)\nP = 0.01 - [2sin(0.02π)] / (4π)\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π)\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow, we calculate the final numerical value:\n*   π ≈ 3.14159265\n*   0.02π ≈ 0.06283185\n*   sin(0.02π) ≈ 0.06279052\n*   2π ≈ 6.2831853\n\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.06279052 / 6.2831853\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.00999342\nP ≈ 0.00000658\n\nThe probability is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶, or 0.000658%. This very low probability is expected because the interval is centered on the point x = a/2, which is a node (a point of zero probability density) for the n=2 state.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
