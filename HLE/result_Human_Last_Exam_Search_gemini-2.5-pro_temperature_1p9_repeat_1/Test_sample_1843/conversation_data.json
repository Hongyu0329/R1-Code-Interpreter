    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor $N$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the property of primitive characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo the corresponding prime power factor of $N$.\nThe character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive for its corresponding modulus:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n### Step 3: Use the property of the order of a character\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\nWe require this order to be 6. This imposes two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of valid choices for each component character\n\n*   **For $\\chi_1$ modulo 4:**\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which has order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: 1 (with order 2).\n\n*   **For $\\chi_2$ modulo 9:**\n    The characters must be primitive modulo 9. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$. The group of all characters modulo 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The imprimitive characters are those induced from modulo 3, whose orders divide $\\phi(3)=2$. Therefore, the primitive characters are those with orders that do not divide 2, i.e., orders 3 and 6. The number of characters of order 3 in a cyclic group of order 6 is $\\phi(3)=2$. The number of characters of order 6 is $\\phi(6)=2$. Both orders (3 and 6) divide 6.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_2$: $2+2 = 4$.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_3$ modulo 7:**\n    For a prime modulus $p$, all non-principal characters are primitive. We need to find the characters whose order divides 6. The group of characters modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. The possible orders are the divisors of 6 (excluding 1 for the principal character).\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_3$: $1+2+2 = 5$.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_4$ modulo 11:**\n    The characters must be primitive (i.e., not the principal character) and have an order that divides 6. The group of characters modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. The order of a character must divide 10. For the order to also divide 6, it must divide their greatest common divisor, $\\gcd(10, 6) = 2$. The only possible order other than 1 is 2.\n    Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (with order 2).\n\n*   **For $\\chi_5$ modulo 13:**\n    The characters must be primitive and their order must divide 6. The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The order of a character must divide 12. For the order to also divide 6, it must divide $\\gcd(12, 6) = 6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_5$: $1+2+2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the results and verify the lcm condition\nThe total number of ways to choose the tuple of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$ is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal choices = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, we must verify that for every combination, the lcm of the orders is exactly 6.\nLet the orders be $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)$. We know:\n*   $o_1 = 2$.\n*   $o_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n*   $o_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   $o_4 = 2$.\n*   $o_5 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe lcm must be a multiple of 2, since $o_1 = 2$.\nThe lcm must be a multiple of 3, since $o_2$ is always 3 or 6.\nTherefore, the lcm is always a multiple of $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nSince all individual orders are divisors of 6, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6.\nA number that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be 6 itself. Thus, the lcm is guaranteed to be 6 for all possible combinations.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
