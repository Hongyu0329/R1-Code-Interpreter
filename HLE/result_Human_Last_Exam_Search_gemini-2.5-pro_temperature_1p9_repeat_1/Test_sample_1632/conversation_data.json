    "A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The Manhattan lattice is another term for the square lattice. The number of such walks of a given length 'n' is denoted by a(n).\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan (or square) lattice, the number of possible walks, a(10), has been calculated to be 44,100. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A001411.\n\nThe number of self-avoiding walks for smaller numbers of steps are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n\nWhile there is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, these values have been determined through computational algorithms.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
