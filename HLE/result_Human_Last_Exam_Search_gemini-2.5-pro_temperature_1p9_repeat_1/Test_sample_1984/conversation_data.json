    "To find the number of stable equilibria, $m$, for the given differential equation, we first need to find the equilibrium points. Equilibrium points are the solutions to $x'(t) = 0$.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\nSet $x'(t) = 0$ to find the equilibrium points:\n$-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0$\nWe can factor out $-x$:\n$-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0$\n\nThis equation gives us the equilibrium points at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. We can analyze the stability by examining the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at each equilibrium point, or by analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around each equilibrium point.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$f'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, let's test the stability of each equilibrium point:\n\n1.  For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\n    We evaluate $f'(0)$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n2.  For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\n    We evaluate $f'(1)$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method, such as analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of $x = 1$.\n    The function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n    *   For a value slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = -(+)(+) = -$. This means that for $x < 1$, $x'(t)$ is negative, so the solution moves away from $x = 1$.\n    *   For a value slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = -(+)(+) = -$. This means that for $x > 1$, $x'(t)$ is negative, so the solution moves towards $x = 1$.\n\nAn equilibrium point is defined as stable if solutions that start near it on *both* sides either stay near it or converge to it. Since solutions starting at $x < 1$ move away from $x=1$, this equilibrium point is not stable. It is classified as semi-stable.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nSo, the number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
