    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes**, the **fin lobes**, and the **vasomotor lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a key component of the posterior subesophageal mass, which governs many of the cuttlefish's posterior motor functions. This lobe is part of a larger group known as the palliovisceral lobe complex.\n\nBased on the 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish, the lobes within the posterior subesophageal mass are situated in close proximity to each other. The palliovisceral lobe is involved in controlling escape movements and the expulsion of ink. The adjacent posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) on the mantle, while the fin lobes control the movement of the fins. The dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes are also located in this posterior region.\n\nTherefore, the main brain regions situated posteriorly alongside the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the vasomotor lobes.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the vasomotor lobes.>>>"
