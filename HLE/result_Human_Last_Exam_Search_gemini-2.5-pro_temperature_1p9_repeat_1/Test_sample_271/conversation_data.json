    "The initial search for the Galois group of the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ did not yield a direct answer. The search results provide general information about Galois theory, including methods for determining Galois groups, such as factoring the polynomial modulo primes, and the relationship between the structure of the Galois group and the solvability of the polynomial by radicals. However, the specific Galois group for the given polynomial is not mentioned. To proceed, I need to determine the Galois group of this specific polynomial. This involves checking for irreducibility, factoring the polynomial modulo various primes to deduce the cycle structures of elements in the Galois group, and then identifying the group based on this information.\n\nFirst, let's try to factor the polynomial. We can see that $p(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6 = (x^2-2)(x^5-9x+3)$.\nSo, the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $p_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $p(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $p_1(x)$ and $p_2(x)$.\n\nThe splitting field of $p_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group of $K_1/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the Galois group of $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nBy Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=3$, the polynomial $x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ because 3 divides all coefficients except the leading one, $3^2$ does not divide the constant term, and 3 does not divide the leading coefficient.\nLet $K_2$ be the splitting field of $p_2(x)$. The Galois group $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n\nWe need to determine which subgroup of $S_5$ it is. Let's look at the discriminant of $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The discriminant of $x^5+ax+b$ is $4^4 a^5 + 5^5 b^4$. For $p_2(x)$, $a=-9$ and $b=3$. So, the discriminant is $256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$. Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_5$.\n\nNow we check the factorization of $p_2(x)$ modulo some primes.\nModulo 2: $x^5+x+1 = (x^2+x+1)(x^3+x^2+1)$. This implies there is a permutation in $G_2$ of type $(2,3)$, which has order 6. This element to the power of 2 is a 3-cycle, and to the power of 3 is a 2-cycle (transposition).\nModulo 5: $x^5 - 9x + 3 \\equiv x^5 - 4x + 3 \\pmod 5$. By testing values: $f(0)=3$, $f(1)=0$, $f(2)=32-8+3=27 \\equiv 2$, $f(3) = 243-12+3 = 234 \\equiv 4$, $f(4)=1024-16+3 = 1011 \\equiv 1$. So, we have one root, $x-1$. $x^5-4x+3=(x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x-3)$.\nThe presence of an irreducible factor of degree 4 would imply a 4-cycle.\nLet's check the irreducibility of $x^4+x^3+x^2+x-3$ mod 5. Let $g(x) = x^4+x^3+x^2+x+2$.\n$g(0)=2, g(1)=1, g(2)=16+8+4+2+2=32 \\equiv 2, g(3)=81+27+9+3+2=122\\equiv 2, g(4)=256+64+16+4+2 = 342 \\equiv 2$. So no linear factors.\nTo check for quadratic factors, we look for $x^2+ax+b$ dividing $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+2$.\nLet's consider another prime. Modulo 7: $x^5-2x+3$. $f(0)=3, f(1)=2, f(2)=32-4+3=31\\equiv 3, f(3)=243-6+3 = 240 \\equiv 2, f(4)=1024-8+3 = 1019 \\equiv 4, f(5) = 3125 -10+3=3118 \\equiv 3, f(6) \\equiv (-1)^5 -2(-1)+3 = -1+2+3 = 4$. So it has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n$p_2(x)$ has 3 real roots since $p_2'(x)=5x^4-9$, so critical points are $\\pm \\sqrt{9/5}$. $p_2(\\sqrt{9/5}) <0$ and $p_2(-\\sqrt{9/5}) > 0$. Three real roots and two complex roots means complex conjugation is a transposition in the Galois group.\n\nSince $p_2(x)$ is an irreducible quintic with a root in $\\mathbb{R}$, its Galois group contains a transposition. The factorization modulo 2 gives an element of cycle type (2,3), whose cube is a transposition. The existence of a transposition and an irreducible quintic implies $G_2$ must be $S_5$.\n\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum of $K_1=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $K_2$, the splitting field of $x^5 - 9x + 3$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $G_1 \\times G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_2 \\times S_5$.\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is the direct product $G = S_2 \\times S_5$. The order of the Galois group is $|G| = |S_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\nThe normal subgroups of $G = S_2 \\times S_5$ are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd S_2$ and $N_2 \\unlhd S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_2$ are the trivial group $\\{e\\}$ and $S_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are the trivial group $\\{e\\}$, the alternating group $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nSo, the normal subgroups of $G$ are:\n1. $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (trivial subgroup)\n2. $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$\n3. $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$\n4. $S_2 \\times \\{e\\}$\n5. $S_2 \\times A_5$\n6. $S_2 \\times S_5$ (the whole group)\n\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ means we are looking for proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. These are:\n- $N_a = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$, with order $|N_a| = 1 \\cdot 60 = 60$. The index is $[G:N_a] = 240/60 = 4$.\n- $N_b = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$, with order $|N_b| = 1 \\cdot 120 = 120$. The index is $[G:N_b] = 240/120 = 2$.\n- $N_c = S_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, with order $|N_c| = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$. The index is $[G:N_c] = 240/2 = 120$.\n- $N_d = S_2 \\times A_5$, with order $|N_d| = 2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. The index is $[G:N_d] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe degree of a normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ is given by the index of a proper non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$.\nFrom our list, the possible indices are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nFinal check of normal subgroups and indices:\n- $G/(\\{e\\} \\times A_5) \\cong S_2 \\times (S_5/A_5) \\cong S_2 \\times C_2$. This group has order 4.\n- $G/(\\{e\\} \\times S_5) \\cong S_2$. This group has order 2.\n- $G/(S_2 \\times \\{e\\}) \\cong S_5$. This group has order 120.\n- $G/(S_2 \\times A_5) \\cong S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. This group has order 2.\n\nThe degrees of the corresponding normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the orders of these quotient groups, which are the indices of the normal subgroups.\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nThe initial analysis of the polynomial and its Galois group appears to be correct. The polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ factors into $p_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\nThe splitting field of $p_1(x)$ is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_2$.\n\nFor $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, the search results confirm several key properties. It is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion for $p=3$. An analysis of its derivative shows it has exactly three real roots and therefore two complex roots. This implies that complex conjugation is a transposition in its Galois group. The search results also explicitly state that the Galois group of $x^5 - 9x + 3$ is $S_5$.\n\nThe splitting field of $p(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $p_1(x)$ and $p_2(x)$. Since the discriminant of $p_2(x)$ is not a square, the splitting field $K_2$ of $p_2(x)$ does not contain any quadratic subfield other than $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant. The discriminant of $x^2-2$ is 8, and the discriminant of $x^5 - 9x + 3$ has been calculated as a large negative number, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is not a subfield of $K_2$. Therefore, the intersection of the splitting fields $K_1$ and $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis confirms that the Galois group $G$ of the splitting field $K$ of $p(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of the Galois groups of the factors: $G = \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_2 \\times S_5$. The order of this group is $|S_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\nNormal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. The normal subgroups of a direct product of groups $G_1 \\times G_2$ are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1$ is a normal subgroup of $G_1$ and $N_2$ is a normal subgroup of $G_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_2$ are the trivial group $\\{e\\}$ and $S_2$ itself.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are the trivial group $\\{e\\}$, the alternating group $A_5$, and $S_5$ itself.\n\nTherefore, the normal subgroups of $G = S_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n1.  $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (trivial)\n2.  $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$\n3.  $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$\n4.  $S_2 \\times \\{e\\}$\n5.  $S_2 \\times A_5$\n6.  $S_2 \\times S_5$ (the whole group)\n\nBy the Galois correspondence, the degree of a normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the index of the corresponding normal subgroup in $G$, i.e., $[G:N] = |G|/|N|$. We are looking for proper, non-trivial normal subgroups.\n\n-   For $N_1 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|N_1| = 1 \\cdot |A_5| = 60$. The degree of the corresponding extension is $[G:N_1] = 240 / 60 = 4$.\n-   For $N_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|N_2| = 1 \\cdot |S_5| = 120$. The degree of the corresponding extension is $[G:N_2] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n-   For $N_3 = S_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|N_3| = |S_2| \\cdot 1 = 2$. The degree of the corresponding extension is $[G:N_3] = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n-   For $N_4 = S_2 \\times A_5$: $|N_4| = |S_2| \\cdot |A_5| = 2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. The degree of the corresponding extension is $[G:N_4] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n\nThe possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are the unique values from this list, which are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nFinal answer seems to be consistent with the gathered information. I can now formulate the final answer.\nLet $K$ be the splitting field of the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The polynomial factors as $p(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n\nLet $p_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe splitting field of $p_1(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group of this extension is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_2$, which has order 2.\n\nThe polynomial $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion for the prime $p=3$. An analysis of the derivative, $p_2'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$, shows that there are two real roots, which means $p_2(x)$ has two critical points. A sign analysis of $p_2(x)$ at its local extrema reveals that it has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots. The presence of three real roots and a pair of complex conjugate roots, for an irreducible quintic polynomial, implies that its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_5$. The splitting field of $p_2(x)$ is denoted as $K_2$, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, which has order 120.\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $p(x)$ is the compositum of the fields $K_1$ and $K_2$. The intersection of these two fields, $K_1 \\cap K_2$, is a subfield of both. The only quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ where $D$ is the discriminant of $p_2(x)$. The discriminant of $x^2 - 2$ is $8$, and the discriminant of $x^5 - 9x + 3$ is a large negative integer, specifically $-14,863,419$. As these discriminants are not rational squares of each other, $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of this group is $|G| = |S_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\nThe normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond, by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, to the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. The normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd G_1$ and $N_2 \\unlhd G_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $S_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, the alternating group $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nThus, the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n*   $H_1 = S_2 \\times \\{e\\}$\n*   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$\n*   $H_3 = S_2 \\times A_5$\n*   $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$\n\nThe degrees of the corresponding normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of these subgroups in $G$:\n*   $[L_1 : \\mathbb{Q}] = [G : H_1] = \\frac{|S_2 \\times S_5|}{|S_2 \\times \\{e\\}|} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$.\n*   $[L_2 : \\mathbb{Q}] = [G : H_2] = \\frac{|S_2 \\times S_5|}{|\\{e\\} \\times A_5|} = \\frac{240}{60} = 4$.\n*   $[L_3 : \\mathbb{Q}] = [G : H_3] = \\frac{|S_2 \\times S_5|}{|S_2 \\times A_5|} = \\frac{240}{120} = 2$.\n*   $[L_4 : \\mathbb{Q}] = [G : H_4] = \\frac{|S_2 \\times S_5|}{|\\{e\\} \\times S_5|} = \\frac{240}{120} = 2$.\n\nThe set of possible degrees for such normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of these distinct index values.\n\n<<<The possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.>>>"
