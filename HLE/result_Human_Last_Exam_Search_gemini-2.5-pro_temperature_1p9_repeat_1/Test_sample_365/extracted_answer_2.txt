The product is a tricyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The structure contains a new carbon-carbon bond between the original C5 of the norbornene and C2' of the cyclopentenyl ring, a new double bond between C1 and C6, and a new ketone at C2, which was the location of the original alcohol. The silyl ether and ketal groups remain intact. The systematic name of the resulting complex structure is not straightforward, but its key features are derived directly from the predictable outcome of the rearrangement.
