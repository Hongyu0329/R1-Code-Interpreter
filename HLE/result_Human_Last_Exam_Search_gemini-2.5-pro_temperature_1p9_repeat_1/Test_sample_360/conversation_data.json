    "### Reaction of 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) yields two isomers.\n\nWhen the bridging ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with two equivalents of *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear ruthenium complex is formed. This resulting dinuclear complex exists as a mixture of two distinct diastereoisomers.\n\nThe two isomers are a meso (Δ/Λ) form, which has a center of inversion, and a racemic (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ) form, which possesses a two-fold rotation axis. These diastereoisomers are separable by techniques such as cation exchange chromatography. Under the reported reaction conditions of refluxing in a 3:1 ethanol:water mixture for 48 hours, the two isomers were observed to form in a 2:1 ratio. The structures of both the meso and racemic diastereoisomers have been confirmed by X-ray crystallography.\n\nThe ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole acts as a bridging ligand, capable of chelating to two separate metal centers. This is why two equivalents of the ruthenium complex are used to synthesize the dinuclear product. The formation of diastereomers arises from the combination of the chirality at the two octahedral ruthenium centers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
