    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is determined by the \"IF\" part (antecedent) of a fuzzy rule. It is calculated by applying a t-norm operator, which is a fuzzy logic equivalent of the logical AND operation, to the membership degrees of the inputs in their respective fuzzy sets.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   **Phi_k(x′) = 0.7**: This value is interpreted as the membership degree of the input `x'` in the first antecedent fuzzy set of rule `k`.\n*   **μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9**: While the notation `G` typically refers to the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of a rule, in this context, to satisfy the requirement of using a t-norm, it must be interpreted as the membership degree for a second antecedent.\n\nA t-norm is a function that combines two membership values into one. Although several t-norms exist, such as the product t-norm (`a * b`) and the Łukasiewicz t-norm (`max(0, a + b - 1)`), the most common is the minimum t-norm (`min(a, b)`). The minimum t-norm is also known as the Gödel t-norm and is frequently the default choice for fuzzy intersection.\n\nUsing the minimum t-norm to calculate the rule activation level:\nActivation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
