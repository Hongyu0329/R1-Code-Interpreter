    "The value computed between heartbeats when tracking HR and HRV using photoplethysmography (PPG) is called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)**.\n\nThis interval is the measurement of time between consecutive heartbeats. While HR gives an average of beats per minute, HRV is specifically concerned with the variations in these beat-to-beat intervals.\n\nThe IBI is also sometimes referred to as the R-R interval, which is the time between the peaks of the QRS complex on an electrocardiogram (ECG). In the context of PPG, which measures blood volume changes, the term inter-beat interval is more commonly used. The analysis of these successive IBIs is fundamental to calculating various HRV metrics, such as RMSSD (the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats) and SDNN (the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals).\n\n<<<inter-beat interval (IBI)>>>"
