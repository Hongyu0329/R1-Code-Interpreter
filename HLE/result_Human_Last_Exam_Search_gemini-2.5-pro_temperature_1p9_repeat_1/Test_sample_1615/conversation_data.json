    "According to Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph G with maximum degree Δ, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most Δ, unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle. If G is a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is Δ + 1.\n\nLet's analyze the given graph G:\n*   It has n = 12345 vertices.\n*   It is not a complete graph.\n*   Let Δ be the maximum degree of G. The maximum possible degree for a vertex in a graph with 12345 vertices is 12344.\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of G, which is the maximum possible value for its chromatic number, χ(G).\n\nA well-known upper bound for the chromatic number of any graph is χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIf a graph G has a chromatic number of 12345, then its minimum degree must be at least 12344. In a graph with 12345 vertices, if every vertex has a degree of at least 12344, then every vertex must be connected to every other vertex. This implies that the graph is the complete graph K_12345. However, the problem states that G is not a complete graph. Therefore, the chromatic number of G must be less than 12345.\n\nSo, we know that χ(G) ≤ 12344. Now we need to determine if a chromatic number of 12344 is achievable for a non-complete graph with 12345 vertices.\n\nLet's consider a specific graph construction. Take a complete graph on 12344 vertices, K_12344, and add one isolated vertex. This new graph, G, has 12345 vertices.\n*   This graph G is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n*   The chromatic number of the K_1234ry_4 component is 12344, and the chromatic number of the isolated vertex is 1. The chromatic number of the disconnected graph G is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components, which is 12344.\n\nAlternatively, consider the graph G' formed by taking the complete graph on 12345 vertices, K_12345, and removing a single edge.\n*   This graph G' is not a complete graph.\n*   The maximum degree of G' is Δ(G') = 12344.\n*   Since G' is not a complete graph, by Brooks' Theorem, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, so χ(G') ≤ 12344.\n*   The subgraph of G' consisting of the 12343 vertices not incident to the removed edge form a clique (a K_12343), which requires 12343 colors. The two vertices from the removed edge are connected to all of these 12343 vertices, so they must be assigned colors different from those 12343 colors. Since these two vertices are not adjacent in G', they can be assigned the same new color. Thus, a total of 12343 + 1 = 12344 colors are needed.\nSo, for this graph G', the chromatic number is exactly 12344.\n\nSince a chromatic number of 12345 is not possible for a non-complete graph with 12345 vertices, and we have constructed a valid non-complete graph with 12345 vertices that requires 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
