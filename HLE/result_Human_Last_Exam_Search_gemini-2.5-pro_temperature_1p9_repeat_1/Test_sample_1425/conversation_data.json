    "### The Partition Function Z in the Grand Canonical Ensemble\n\nThe grand canonical partition function, denoted by Z, for a system described by a Hamiltonian operator H^ and in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T and chemical potential μ, is given by the trace (Tr) over the system's states:\n\nZ = Tr[e^(-β(H^ - μN^))]\n\nHere, β = 1/(k_B T), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and N^ is the particle number operator.\n\nFor the specific case where the system's Hamiltonian is given by H^ = -μ₀N^, the expression inside the exponent becomes:\n\nH^ - μN^ = -μ₀N^ - μN^ = -(μ₀ + μ)N^\n\nThus, the partition function is:\n\nZ = Tr[e^(β(μ₀ + μ)N^)]\n\nThis trace is taken over the entire Fock space, which includes states with all possible particle numbers.\n\n### Path Integral Representation\n\nIn the path integral formulation of quantum statistical mechanics, the partition function Z is expressed as a functional integral over field configurations. The specific form of the integral and the action depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions.\n\nThe general form is:\n**Z = ∫Dψ*Dψ e^(-S_E [ψ*,ψ])**\n\nwhere S_E is the Euclidean action. The integral is performed over all field configurations ψ(x, τ) and their conjugates ψ*(x, τ), where x represents spatial coordinates and τ is the imaginary time variable, which ranges from 0 to β = 1/(k_B T).\n\nThe Euclidean action S_E is derived from the operator H^ - μN^. For a general Hamiltonian, the action for a quantum field is given by:\n\nS_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ψ*(x, τ) [∂_τ + H - μ] ψ(x, τ)\n\nIn this specific problem, the Hamiltonian operator H^ corresponds to -μ₀N^, and the particle number operator N^ corresponds to ψ*ψ. Therefore, the operator inside the action becomes:\n\nH^ - μN^  →  ∂_τ - μ₀ - μ\n\nThis leads to the Euclidean action:\n\n**S_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ψ*(x, τ) [∂_τ - (μ₀ + μ)] ψ(x, τ)**\n\n**Final Expression for the Partition Function:**\n\nThe partition function Z for a system with the Hamiltonian H^ = -μ₀N^ in the grand canonical ensemble is given by the path integral:\n\n**Z = ∫Dψ*Dψ exp( - ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ψ*(x, τ) [∂_τ - (μ₀ + μ)] ψ(x, τ) )**\n\nThe boundary conditions on the field ψ in the imaginary time direction depend on the particle statistics:\n*   For **bosons**, ψ is a complex-valued field satisfying periodic boundary conditions: ψ(x, 0) = ψ(x, β).\n*   For **fermions**, ψ is a Grassmann-valued field satisfying anti-periodic boundary conditions: ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β).\n\nThis formulation represents the grand canonical partition function by summing over the contributions of all possible field histories in imaginary time, weighted by the Euclidean action derived from the specified Hamiltonian.\n\n<<<**Z = ∫Dψ*Dψ exp( - ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ψ*(x, τ) [∂_τ - (μ₀ + μ)] ψ(x, τ) )**>>>"
