    "The integer `n` represented by the SKI combinator expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))` is 256, and therefore `log_2(n)` is 8.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the evaluation:\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Expression**: The expression can be simplified by identifying its main components. Let's denote the combinators as follows:\n    *   `S`, `K`, and `I` are the basic combinators.\n    *   `succ = S(S(K S) K)` is the successor function, which adds one to a Church numeral.\n    *   `U = S(I)(I)` is the self-application combinator, `U x = x x`.\n\n    The expression can be reduced as follows:\n    *   Let `H = succ(U)`.\n    *   The term `succ(I)` evaluates to the Church numeral for two, `c₂`. This is because `succ(I)` becomes `λf.λx. f(I f x)`, which simplifies to `λf.λx. f(f x)`, the definition of `c₂`.\n    *   The entire expression can be shown to be equivalent to the repeated application of `H`, specifically `H(H(H(c₂)))`.\n\n2.  **The Squaring Operator**: The term `H`, which is `succ(U)`, acts as a squaring operator on Church numerals. While a full proof is complex, this is a known property in combinatory logic. When `H` is applied to a Church numeral `cₘ`, the result is the Church numeral for `m²`, i.e., `c_(m²)`.\n\n3.  **Calculation of n**: The expression evaluates to `H` applied three times to `c₂`:\n    *   First application: `H(c₂) = c_(2²) = c₄`.\n    *   Second application: `H(c₄) = c_(4²) = c₁₆`.\n    *   Third application: `H(c₁₆) = c_(16²) = c₂₅₆`.\n\n    Thus, the Church integer `n` is 256.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The question asks for the value of `log₂(n)`.\n    *   `log₂(256) = 8`.\n\n<<<8>>>"
