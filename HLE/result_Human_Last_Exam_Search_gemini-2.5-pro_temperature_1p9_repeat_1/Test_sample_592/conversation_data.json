However, a specific US city is never mentioned in the film.\n\nThe narrative of the film, directed by Paolo Virzì, follows the life of the protagonist, Piero, in Livorno, Italy. His friendship with the wealthy and rebellious Tommaso is a central part of his adolescence. Their paths diverge when Tommaso, after successfully graduating, leaves for America, while Piero remains in Livorno and begins working in a factory owned by Tommaso's father. Plot summaries and reviews of the movie consistently refer to Tommaso's destination as \"the USA\" or \"America\" without providing a more specific location.\n\n<<<Not mentioned in the movie>>>"
