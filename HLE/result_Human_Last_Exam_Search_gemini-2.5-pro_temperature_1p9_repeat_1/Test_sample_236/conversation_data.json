    "An analysis of the homology cobordism group and the effects of integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings reveals that an infinite number of elements in this group can be represented. The knots with a crossing number of at most four are the unknot (0 crossings), the trefoil knot (3 crossings), and the figure-eight knot (4 crossings).\n\nIntegral surgery on the **unknot** can produce an infinite family of lens spaces. Specifically, an *n*-surgery on the unknot, where *n* is an integer, results in the lens space L(n, 1). For *n* = 0, this is the manifold S¹ × S², and for *n* = ±1, the resulting manifold is the 3-sphere S³, which represents the trivial element of the homology cobordism group. However, for all other integers *n*, the lens spaces L(n, 1) represent distinct, non-trivial elements in the homology cobordism group. It has been established that two lens spaces are homology cobordant if and only if they are orientedly homeomorphic, which for the L(n,1) spaces implies that their corresponding 'n' values must be equal. Consequently, integral surgeries on the unknot alone generate an infinite number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\nSimilarly, integral surgery on the **trefoil knot** also yields an infinite number of homology cobordism classes. For instance, a +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot produces the Poincaré homology sphere. The Poincaré sphere is known to have an infinite order in the homology cobordism group, meaning that its multiples under the connected sum operation generate a ℤ subgroup. Different integral surgeries on the trefoil knot can lead to other homology spheres that are not homology cobordant to each other or to the Poincaré sphere.\n\nFinally, integral surgeries on the **figure-eight knot** also contribute to the diversity of representable homology cobordism elements. The figure-eight knot is notable for being a torsion element in the knot concordance group, having an order of 2. Despite this, surgeries on the figure-eight knot can produce manifolds that have infinite order in the homology cobordism group. In fact, some Brieskorn spheres, which are known to generate an infinite-rank subgroup of the homology cobordism group, can be realized through surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n\nIn summary, since integral surgery on just the unknot—the simplest knot with at most four crossings—is sufficient to generate an infinite number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, the total number of such elements representable by surgery on all knots with at most four crossings is also infinite.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
