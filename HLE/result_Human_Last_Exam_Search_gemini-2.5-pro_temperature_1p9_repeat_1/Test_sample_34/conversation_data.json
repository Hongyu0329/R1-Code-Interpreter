    "Based on established poker theory and an analysis of pre-flop opening ranges, the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game is determined by its limited post-flop playability.\n\nIn poker, the strength of a starting hand is influenced by its high-card value and its connectivity (the ability to make straights and flushes). While all suited jacks can make flushes, their potential to make other strong hands varies.\n\nThe lowest suited jacks, such as J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s, are at the bottom of a standard button opening range. When comparing these hands:\n*   **J5s** and **J4s** have slightly better connectivity and higher kickers than the lower counterparts. For instance, J5s can form a straight with a 6, 7, 8, and 9. One source suggests that against a 2.5bb button raise, calling with hands from J8s down to J5s is acceptable from the big blind, implying these are standard opens from the button.\n*   **J3s** and **J2s** have significantly weaker playability. They have the largest gaps, making straights less likely, and their kickers are the lowest, which can lead to being out-kicked when pairing the Jack.\n\nGiven these factors, **J2s** is considered the worst suited Jack to open. It possesses the lowest kicker and the largest gap between the two cards, which severely hinders its ability to win pots post-flop if it doesn't immediately flop a flush draw or two pair. While modern GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategies might include opening this hand from the button in a rake-free environment due to the positional advantage, it represents the absolute bottom of the playable suited jack range.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
