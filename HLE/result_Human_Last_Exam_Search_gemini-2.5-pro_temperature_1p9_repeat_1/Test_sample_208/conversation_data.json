    "When fourteen circles of radius one are tightly packed into another circle, the radius of this larger circle is approximately 3.888. This result has been mathematically proven to be the optimal solution.\n\nThe problem of determining the smallest circle that can contain a given number of non-overlapping unit circles is a classic problem in geometry known as the circle packing problem. For 14 circles, the arrangement is known, and the ratio of the radius of the enclosing circle to the radius of the smaller circles is 3.887821410.... Therefore, for circles of radius one, the radius of the containing circle is approximately 3.888 when rounded to four significant digits.\n\n<<<3.888>>>"
