    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclic reaction of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which form the basis for the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. These rules predict the stereochemical outcome of pericyclic reactions based on the number of π-electrons involved and the reaction conditions (thermal or photochemical).\n\n### Analysis using FMO Theory\n\n1.  **Electron Count and Reaction Mode:** The reacting polyene is a deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, which has a conjugated system of eight π-electrons. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a system with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 for this molecule) undergoes a **conrotatory** ring closure under thermal conditions. This mode of rotation is considered \"symmetry-allowed,\" implying a lower activation energy, whereas the opposite disrotatory mode is \"symmetry-forbidden.\"\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Starting Material:** The stereochemistry of the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, is crucial for determining the final product's stereochemistry. The substituents at the termini of the conjugated system are methyl (Me) groups.\n    *   At the C2=C3 double bond, which has a *Z* configuration, the methyl group can be considered to be pointing \"inward\" relative to the carbon chain as it coils to react.\n    *   At the C8=C9 double bond, which has an *E* configuration, the methyl group points \"outward.\"\n\n3.  **Predicting the Product:** The conrotatory motion involves the two termini of the polyene rotating in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to form the new sigma bond. Applying this to the specific starting material:\n    *   A conrotatory ring closure of the \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) isomer forces the two methyl groups to opposite faces of the newly forming eight-membered ring.\n    *   This specific stereochemical outcome results in the formation of the ***trans***-**7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene** (isomer B).\n\nA similar analysis for a related isomer, \\((2E,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-decatetraene, also shows that conrotatory closure leads specifically to the *trans*-isomer. Conversely, for the reaction to yield the *cis*-isomer (A), a disrotatory ring closure would be required. This pathway is symmetry-forbidden under thermal conditions.\n\n### Conclusion on the Ratio of Products A and B\n\nFrontier Molecular Orbital theory unequivocally predicts that the thermal electrocyclization will proceed through a conrotatory pathway. For the given \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) reactant, this allowed pathway leads exclusively to the formation of the *trans*-isomer B. The formation of the *cis*-isomer A via the thermally forbidden disrotatory pathway is not expected to occur to any significant extent.\n\nTherefore, FMO theory predicts that the ratio of A (cis-isomer) to B (trans-isomer) will be very close to **0:100**. Product B will be the overwhelmingly dominant, if not exclusive, product.\n\n<<<The ratio of A:B is predicted to be close to 0:100, heavily favoring product B.>>>"
