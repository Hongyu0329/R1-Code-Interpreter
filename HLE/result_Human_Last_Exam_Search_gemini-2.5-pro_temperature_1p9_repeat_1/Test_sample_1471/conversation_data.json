    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the equation:\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Roman numerals into modern numbers:\n*   **VI** = 6\n*   **CCC** = 300\n*   **MMCMLI** = 2951\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation with these numbers:\n6 / 300 - 2951\n\nNext, we follow the order of operations (division first, then subtraction):\n1.  6 ÷ 300 = 0.02\n2.  0.02 - 2951 = -2950.98\n\n<<<−2950.98>>>"
