    "True.\n\nSNP heritability (often denoted as h²<sub>snp</sub>) represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically across the entire genome. It is the theoretical ceiling or upper bound for the predictive power of any linear model based on these SNPs, including a polygenic score (PGS).\n\nA polygenic score calculates an individual's genetic predisposition for a trait by summing the effects of many SNPs, with each SNP weighted by its estimated effect size from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The predictive ability of the PGS is measured by the variance it explains in the trait (R²).\n\nIn practice, the variance explained by a PGS is virtually always lower than the SNP heritability for several reasons:\n*   **Estimation Error:** The SNP effect sizes used to build the score are estimates from a finite GWAS sample and are not the true, underlying effect sizes. This error reduces the predictive accuracy.\n*   **Sample Differences:** The genetic structure (like linkage disequilibrium) and environmental factors can differ between the GWAS sample used to create the score and the target sample in which the score is tested, which lowers its predictive power.\n*   **Methodological Limitations:** The statistical methods used to create the score may not perfectly capture the true genetic architecture of the trait.\n\nIdeally, if the true effect sizes of all causal SNPs were known and perfectly applied, the variance explained by the PGS could equal the SNP heritability. However, because this ideal scenario is never achieved in reality, the predictive power of a polygenic score is in practice lower than the total SNP heritability.\n\n<<<True>>>"
