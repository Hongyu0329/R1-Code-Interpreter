    "To find the index of the given boundary-value problem, we need to determine two key quantities: the dimension of the system of differential equations and the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n### 1. Dimension of the System (n)\n\nThe problem describes a system of differential equations for a vector `x(t)`. The vector is given as:\n`x(t) = (x₁(t), x₂(t), x₃(t), ..., x₂₀₂₄(t))`\n\nThis indicates that there are 2024 unknown functions, making the dimension of the system of ordinary differential equations **n = 2024**.\n\nAlthough the matrix `A` and the vector `I(t)` are specified with a dimension of 202000, the boundary conditions only involve the components of `x(t)` up to `x₂₀₂₄(t)`. We proceed by considering the dimension of the system as defined by the vector `x(t)` and the accompanying boundary conditions.\n\n### 2. Number of Linearly Independent Boundary Conditions (r)\n\nThe boundary conditions provided are:\n1.  `x₁(T) - x₁(0) = 0`\n2.  `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`\n3.  `5x₂(T) - 5x₂(0) = 0`\n4.  `100x₂(T) - 100x₂(0) = 0`\n5.  `1000x₂(0) - 1000x₂(T) = 0`\n6.  `100x₂₀₂₄(T) - 100x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`\n\nWe need to analyze these conditions to find how many of them are linearly independent.\n*   Conditions 2, 3, 4, and 5 all relate `x₂(T)` and `x₂(0)`.\n*   Condition 3 is `5 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`, which is a scalar multiple of condition 2.\n*   Condition 4 is `100 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`, which is also a scalar multiple of condition 2.\n*   Condition 5 is `-1000 * (x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`, again a scalar multiple of condition 2.\n*   Condition 6, `100x₂₀₂₄(T) - 100x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`, simplifies to `x₂₀₂₄(T) - x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`.\n\nTherefore, the set of linearly independent boundary conditions is:\n1.  `x₁(T) - x₁(0) = 0`\n2.  `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`\n3.  `x₂₀₂₄(T) - x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`\n\nThere are **r = 3** linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Index\n\nFor a linear boundary value problem for a system of `n` ordinary differential equations with `r` independent boundary conditions, the operator is of Fredholm type, and its index `k` is calculated as:\n`k = n - r`\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n`k = 2024 - 3 = 2021`\n\nThe index of the considered problem is 2021.\n\n<<<2021>>>"
