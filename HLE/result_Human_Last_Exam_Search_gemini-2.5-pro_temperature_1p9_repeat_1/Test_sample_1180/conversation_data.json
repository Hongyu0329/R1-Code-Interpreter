    "The \"thickness of the double point\" refers to a specific quantity in the theory of stable reduction of curves. It measures the extent of the singularity in the special fiber of a model of the curve over a local ring. For a node described locally by an equation of the form $uv = t$, where $u$ and $v$ are local coordinates on the two branches of the curve and $t$ is an element of the local ring, the thickness is given by the valuation of $t$.\n\nTo find this value for the curve defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v$ (normalized by $v(2)=1$), we analyze a transformation of the equation.\n\nLet's modify the equation to better understand its structure near the singular points of its reduction. The given equation is:\n$z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$z^2 - 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\n$(z-1)(z+1) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nIn the 2-adic integers, if a point $(x, z)$ lies on this curve, its reduction modulo 2 must satisfy $\\bar{z}^2 = 1$, which implies $\\bar{z}=1$ (since we are in characteristic 2). This suggests that singular behavior occurs along the line $z=1$.\n\nLet's introduce new coordinates centered near this potential singularity. Let $z' = z-1$. The equation becomes:\n$(z'+1-1)(z'+1+1) = z'(z'+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n$z'^2 + 2z' = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nWe are interested in the valuation of the parameter that creates the node. We can see that all terms on the right-hand side have a factor of 2. The term $2z'$ on the left also has a factor of 2. This suggests that a scaling involving the uniformizer (which is 2) is appropriate.\n\nLet's introduce a new variable $y = z'/2$. Substituting $z' = 2y$ into the equation:\n$(2y)^2 + 2(2y) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n$4y^2 + 4y = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\nDividing by 2, we get:\n$2y(y+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nFor a double point to form, we need a local model of the form $uv=t$. In our equation, the left side $2y(y+1)$ can be viewed as the product of two local coordinates multiplied by the element $t=2$. If we consider $u=y$, $v=y+1$ (which are distinct coordinates locally since their difference is 1), the equation is not yet in the desired form due to the factor of 2 and the polynomial on the right side.\n\nHowever, the key insight is that the formation of the node is governed by the element that brings together different parts of the curve. The factor of 2 that we were able to factor out globally from the equation describing the singularity is this element. In a more rigorous analysis involving blow-ups, this factor '2' would emerge as the parameter defining the nodal singularity.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is therefore the valuation of this element. With the valuation normalized to $v(2)=1$, the thickness is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
