    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth. This is demonstrated through his actions and dialogue which reveal a deep sense of longing and guilt.\n\nA key piece of evidence is Kris's attempt to replicate the sound of rustling leaves aboard the space station. Despite his initially detached and cold demeanor, he attaches strips of paper to air vents to simulate the sound, indicating his deep-seated nostalgia for Earthly nature. This act is a manifestation of the emptiness and psychological distress the astronauts experience.\n\nFurthermore, Kris is the character who explicitly speaks about the concept of shame as a fundamental and even redemptive human emotion. He states, \"Guibariane did not die of fear, he died out of shame. The salvation of humanity is in its shame.\" In another instance, he says, \"Shame, the feeling that will save mankind.\" This preoccupation with shame is linked to the haunting experiences on the station, which force the characters to confront their pasts and their essential humanity.\n\nWhile the film does not feature a direct quote from Kris stating he is ashamed of missing the rustling leaves specifically, his actions to recreate the sound and his philosophical musings on shame strongly connect him to this sentiment. His shame is tied to a broader sense of loss and a painful awareness of his own humanity when confronted with the alien environment of Solaris.\n\n<<<A>>>"
