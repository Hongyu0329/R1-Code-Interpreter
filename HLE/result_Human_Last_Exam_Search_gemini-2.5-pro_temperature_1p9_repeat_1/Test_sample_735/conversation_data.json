    "There are exactly 15 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion (also known as locally maximal) product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for all elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including when *a* and *b* are the same element), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" or \"locally maximal\" if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in that group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by Chimere S. Anabanti and Sarah B. Hart. In their paper, \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3,\" they proved that any such group must have an order of at most 24. Their work provides a complete list of these groups.\n\nThe 15 finite groups are:\n*   **Abelian Groups:**\n    *   C₅ (Cyclic group of order 5)\n    *   C₆ (Cyclic group of order 6)\n    *   C₇ (Cyclic group of order 7)\n    *   C₈ (Cyclic group of order 8)\n    *   C₂ × C₄\n    *   C₉ (Cyclic group of order 9)\n    *   C₃ × C₃\n    *   C₁₀ (Cyclic group of order 10)\n    *   C₁₂ (Cyclic group of order 12)\n    *   C₁₃ (Cyclic group of order 13)\n*   **Non-Abelian Groups:**\n    *   S₃ (Symmetric group of order 6)\n    *   D₁₀ (Dihedral group of order 10)\n    *   A₄ (Alternating group of order 12)\n    *   SL(2,3) (Special linear group of degree 2 over the field of 3 elements)\n    *   A non-abelian group of order 20, specifically `SmallGroup(20,3)` in the Small Groups Library.\n\nThis comprehensive classification resolves the question by identifying all such groups.\n\n<<<15>>>"
