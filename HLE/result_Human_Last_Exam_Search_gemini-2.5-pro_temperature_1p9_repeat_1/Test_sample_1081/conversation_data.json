    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are classified by the Frobenius conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nFirst, we establish that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split. The classification of algebraic group forms over a field $k$ is given by the Galois cohomology set $H^1(k, \\text{Aut}(G_{\\text{split}}))$. For a simple group like $E_8$, the automorphism group is a semi-direct product of the adjoint group and the group of diagram automorphisms. The Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial symmetries, so the diagram automorphism group is trivial. This implies that any form of $E_8$ is an inner form. For a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, Lang's theorem states that $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G)$ is trivial for any connected linear algebraic group $G$. This means any inner form is isomorphic to the split form. Therefore, any reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is isomorphic to the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$.\n\nFor a split group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group. Consequently, the Frobenius conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group.\n\nThe question is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. This is a well-known result in the theory of Lie groups and reflection groups. The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has 112 conjugacy classes.\n\n<<<112>>>"
