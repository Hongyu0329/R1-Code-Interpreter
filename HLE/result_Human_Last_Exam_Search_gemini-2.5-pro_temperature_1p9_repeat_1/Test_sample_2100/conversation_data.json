    "The man Andrei Voznesensky wrote about, and whose gravesite was rediscovered, is Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nAndrei Voznesensky's famous rock opera, \"Juno and Avos,\" is based on his 1970 poem \"Avos!\". This work tells the story of the real-life Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The plot centers on Rezanov's journey to California in 1806, where he met and fell in love with Concepción \"Conchita\" Argüello, the 15-year-old daughter of the commandant of San Francisco.\n\nRezanov, a key figure in the Russian-American Company, was on a mission to secure provisions for the starving Russian colonies in Alaska. After becoming engaged to Conchita, Rezanov had to return to Russia to seek the Tsar's permission to marry a Catholic. However, he fell ill during the arduous journey across Siberia and died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807.\n\nThe original monument on his grave was destroyed during the Soviet era. While the answer to his grave's final resting place was a matter of historical interest for many years, a new memorial was erected at the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk in the year 2000, where his remains were believed to have been reburied. The story of Rezanov and Conchita's tragic romance was immortalized by Voznesensky, capturing the public's imagination for decades.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
