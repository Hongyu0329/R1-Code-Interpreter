    "When a curve's Jacobian has good reduction, its stable reduction must be a curve of compact type. This means the dual graph of the stable reduction is a tree. The arithmetic genus of this stable curve, which is 4, is the sum of the geometric genera of its irreducible components. Each of these components must also be stable.\n\nA component curve with genus `g_i` and `k_i` nodes is stable if `2*g_i - 2 + k_i > 0`.\n- If `g_i >= 2`, the condition is always met since `k_i >= 1`.\n- If `g_i = 1`, it needs `k_i >= 1`, which is true for any component in a tree-like structure (except for a single isolated vertex, which isn't a component).\n- If `g_i = 0`, it needs `k_i >= 3`.\n\nWe must therefore find the number of distinct stable curve structures whose components are arranged in a tree, such that the sum of the genera of the components is 4, and any genus-0 component is connected to at least three other components.\n\nThese structures can be classified by first partitioning the number 4 into the genera of the components, and then for each partition, determining the number of distinct, stable tree arrangements.\n\n### Case 1: Components with genus > 0\n\nWe list the partitions of 4 into positive integers:\n\n1.  **{4}**: This represents a single, smooth, irreducible curve of genus 4. This is one type.\n2.  **{3, 1}**: A genus-3 curve connected to a genus-1 curve (elliptic curve). There is only one way to connect two components. This is a second type.\n3.  **{2, 2}**: Two genus-2 curves connected to each other. This is a third type.\n4.  **{2, 1, 1}**: One genus-2 and two genus-1 components. For three components, the only tree structure is a line. There are two distinct arrangements based on the position of the genus-2 curve:\n    *   The genus-2 curve is in the middle: (g=1) --- (g=2) --- (g=1).\n    *   The genus-2 curve is at an end: (g=2) --- (g=1) --- (g=1).\n    These two arrangements constitute two distinct types.\n5.  **{1, 1, 1, 1}**: Four elliptic curves. There are two non-isomorphic trees with four vertices: a path and a star shape. This gives two more types.\n\nSo far, we have 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7 types.\n\n### Case 2: Components including genus 0\n\nAny genus-0 component must be connected to at least 3 other components.\n\n6.  **One genus-0 component**: The sum of the genera of the components it connects to must be 4. These \"leg\" components must be arranged in a star shape around the central genus-0 curve. We consider the partitions of 4 into `k>=3` positive integers.\n    *   `k=3`: The only partition is **{2, 1, 1}**. A central genus-0 curve connected to one genus-2 and two genus-1 curves. This is one type.\n    *   `k=4`: The only partition is **{1, 1, 1, 1}**. A central genus-0 curve connected to four genus-1 curves. This gives another type.\n\n7.  **Two genus-0 components**: Let them be C1 and C2. For both to have at least 3 connections while keeping the graph a tree and the sum of positive genera equal to 4, they must be connected to each other. Each then needs at least two additional connections to components of positive genus. If we connect two genus-1 curves to C1 and two genus-1 curves to C2, we get a valid stable configuration of genus 4. The four genus-1 curves form the partition **{1, 1, 1, 1}** of 4. This H-shaped configuration is a single distinct type.\n\nMore complex arrangements with more genus-0 components are not possible as it would require partitioning 4 into too many positive integers.\n\nIn total, the number of types are:\n*   7 types with no genus-0 components.\n*   2 types with one genus-0 component.\n*   1 type with two genus-0 components.\n\nThe total number of types of stable reductions is 7 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
