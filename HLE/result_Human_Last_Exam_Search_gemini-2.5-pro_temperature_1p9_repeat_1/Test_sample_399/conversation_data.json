    "To solve the initial value problem, we first need to find the general solution of the differential equation and then use the initial condition to determine the particular solution. Finally, we can evaluate the solution at the desired point.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can rewrite it as:\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$\n\nSeparate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other:\n$\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt$\n\nNext, integrate both sides of the equation:\n$\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt$\n\nThe integration yields:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of C. Substitute $t = 0$ and $x = -8$:\n$-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$\n$\\frac{1}{8} = C$\n\nSubstitute the value of C back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$-\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nNow we need to find the value of $x(1)$. Substitute $t = 1$ into the particular solution:\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}$\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}$\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTo combine the fractions on the right side, find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}$\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}$\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n$\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}$\n\nFinally, solve for $x(1)$:\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
