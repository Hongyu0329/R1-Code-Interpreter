    "Yes, it follows that if $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a Schwartz class function such that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$, then $f$ must be the zero function.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\nA function $f$ belongs to the Schwartz space, denoted $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, if it is a smooth function (infinitely differentiable) and it, along with all its derivatives, decays faster than any inverse power of $|x|$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$.\n\nLet $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$, defined as:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i \\xi x} \\,dx $$\nA fundamental property of the Schwartz space is that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism from $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ to itself. This means that if $f$ is a Schwartz function, then its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function.\n\nThe derivatives of the Fourier transform can be related to the moments of the original function. The $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} (\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i \\xi x} \\,dx $$\nEvaluating these derivatives at $\\xi = 0$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} (0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\,dx $$\nThe condition given in the problem is that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (non-negative integers). This implies that all the derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ at the origin are zero:\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} (0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\nSince $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, it is infinitely differentiable. The Taylor series expansion of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi = 0$ is given by:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k!} \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} (0) \\xi^k $$\nAs all the derivatives at the origin are zero, the Taylor series is identically zero. Since $\\hat{f}$ is a smooth function (in fact, it's analytic as a consequence of being a Schwartz function), and all of its Taylor coefficients at $\\xi=0$ are zero, this implies that $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be identically zero in a neighborhood of the origin.\n\nFurthermore, because Schwartz functions are analytic, if a Schwartz function is zero on any open interval, it must be zero everywhere. Therefore, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFinally, since the Fourier transform is an isomorphism on the Schwartz space, if $\\hat{f} = 0$, then $f$ must also be the zero function. This can be seen by applying the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nIt is worth noting that while there exist non-zero functions in other function classes (like $L^1$) that have all moments equal to zero, the strong decay and smoothness properties of Schwartz functions prevent this.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
