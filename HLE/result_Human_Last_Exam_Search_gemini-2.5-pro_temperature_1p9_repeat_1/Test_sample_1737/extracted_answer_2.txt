The number of distinct non-zero values for the totally symmetric structure constants $d_{ijk}$ of SU(N) is not constant but depends on N. For SU(2), there are no non-zero $d_{ijk}$. For SU(3), there are 4 distinct non-zero values. For a general N, the exact number of values would be derived from the explicit formulas for the $d_{ijk}$ which involve coefficients dependent on N.
