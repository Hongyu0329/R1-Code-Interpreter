  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To determine the maximum length of the secret message hidden in the Ching, we need to establish how the symbols of the Ching can be used to encode the characters from the Shu.\n\n1.  **Identify the alphabet of the message:** The secret message is written using the characters from the Shu. We are told that the Shu uses a set of 120 common Chinese characters. Therefore, the alphabet for our secret message consists of 120 unique characters.\n\n2.  **Identify the encoding symbols:** The Ching is composed of 9999 \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbols. A single yinyang-wuxing symbol is a combination of one of two states (yin or yang) and one of five elements (wuxing: water, fire, wood, metal, earth). This means there are 2 x 5 = 10 possible unique symbols (e.g., yin-water, yang-fire, yin-earth, etc.).\n\n3.  **Determine the encoding scheme:** We need to find the minimum number of symbols from the Ching required to represent a single character from the 120-character alphabet. Let's call the number of Ching symbols needed 'k'. Since there are 10 possible unique symbols in the Ching, with a sequence of 'k' symbols, we can represent 10^k unique things.\n\n    We need to find the smallest integer 'k' such that the number of combinations is greater than or equal to the number of characters in our alphabet:\n    10^k â‰¥ 120\n\n    *   If k = 1, we can represent 10^1 = 10 characters. This is not enough.\n    *   If k = 2, we can represent 10^2 = 100 characters. This is still not enough.\n    *   If k = 3, we can represent 10^3 = 1000 characters. This is sufficient to assign a unique 3-symbol code to each of the 120 characters.\n\n    Therefore, it takes 3 symbols from the Ching to encode one character of the secret message.\n\n4.  **Calculate the maximum message length:** The Ching contains a total of 9999 symbols. Since each character of the message requires 3 symbols for encoding, the maximum length of the message is the total number of symbols divided by the number of symbols per character.\n\n    Maximum message length = (Total symbols in Ching) / (Symbols per character)\n    Maximum message length = 9999 / 3\n    Maximum message length = 3333\n\nThe information regarding the number of characters in the Shu (around 3000) and the computation/recognition times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) is extraneous and not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe maximum length of the message is 3333 characters.\n<<<3333>>>"
