    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museums in Berlin) in 1967. The painting is part of the collection of the Nationalgalerie (National Gallery).\n\nThe acquisition was a purchase from the artist's widow, Maria Günther, in Gera. The artwork, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petty Bourgeois at the Radio), was created by Günther in the same year as his artistic breakthrough. The painting, rendered in tempera on wood, depicts a man, said to be a paraplegic neighbor of the artist, sitting in a wheelchair and listening to the radio. It is considered a significant work of the New Objectivity movement in Germany.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
