    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, red, black, violet, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that can appear white, colorless, or even yellow. The yellowish tint is often due to impurities or exposure to light, which causes a gradual conversion to red phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus has a characteristic deep red or reddish-violet powder-like appearance.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable form and has a black or grey, flaky appearance with a metallic luster, similar to graphite.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, is another crystalline form. It can appear as violet, red-purple, or even dark orange crystals.\n\nA more recently synthesized allotrope is blue phosphorus. This two-dimensional material shares a layered structure with black phosphorus and is blue in color.\n\nWhile \"yellow phosphorus\" is a commonly heard term, it is not considered a distinct allotrope but rather white phosphorus that has aged or contains impurities.\n\n<<<5>>>"
