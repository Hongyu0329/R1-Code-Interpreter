    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n### Analysis of Molecular Structure and Symmetry:\n\n1.  **Central Core**: The molecule has a central 1,3,5-substituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core. This core possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituents attached at the 1, 3, and 5 positions are chemically equivalent. Similarly, the three methyl groups at the 2, 4, and 6 positions are also chemically equivalent.\n\n2.  **Substituent**: The substituent is `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl`. The indazole portion, also known as camphopyrazole or camphazol, is derived from camphor and has fixed chirality at its stereocenters (4S, 7R). This makes the substituent group chiral and rigid.\n\n### Counting the Non-Equivalent Proton Signals:\n\nDue to the molecule's overall C3 symmetry, we only need to count the number of chemically unique proton signals in one-third of the molecule and sum them up. Let's break this down into the core, the linker, and the camphazol substituent.\n\n*   **Central Core Protons**:\n    1.  **Methyl Groups (at C2, C4, C6)**: The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are equivalent due to C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Linker Protons**:\n    2.  **Methylene Groups (-CH₂-)**: The three methylene (`-CH₂-`) groups that connect the central ring to the indazole units are also equivalent due to C3 symmetry. These will give rise to another single signal. **(1 signal)**\n\n*   **Protons within one Indazole Substituent**:\n    The substituent is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. This is an asymmetric, chiral unit. Therefore, all protons within this single unit that are not interchangeable by a local symmetry operation (of which there are none) will be chemically non-equivalent. Let's count the protons in one such unit, based on the known structure of camphopyrazole:\n    3.  **Pyrazole Ring Proton (H3)**: There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole system. **(1 signal)**\n    4.  **Bridgehead Proton (H4)**: There is one proton at the C4 bridgehead position. **(1 signal)**\n    5.  **Methylene Protons at C5**: This `-CH₂-` group is adjacent to a chiral center (C4), making its two protons diastereotopic. They are chemically non-equivalent and will appear as two distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n    6.  **Methylene Protons at C6**: Similarly, the two protons on the C6 methylene group are diastereotopic and will give two separate signals. **(2 signals)**\n    7.  **Methyl Protons at C7**: The methyl group attached to the C7 quaternary stereocenter is unique. **(1 signal)**\n    8.  **gem-Dimethyl Protons at C8**: The two methyl groups at the C8 position are diastereotopic because of the overall chirality of the camphane skeleton. They are non-equivalent and will produce two distinct signals. **(2 signals)**\n\n### Summary of Proton Signals:\nAdding up all the unique signals:\n*   From the central core methyls: 1\n*   From the methylene linkers: 1\n*   From one camphazol unit: 1 (H3) + 1 (H4) + 2 (H5) + 2 (H6) + 1 (C7-CH₃) + 2 (C8-CH₃'s) = 9 signals.\n\n**Total number of signals = 1 (core CH₃) + 1 (linker CH₂) + 9 (substituent) = 11 signals.**\n\nThis analysis aligns with spectroscopic data for similar symmetric molecules containing these chiral substituents, where the overall C3 symmetry simplifies the spectrum, but the inherent asymmetry of the substituent leads to a large number of distinct signals from that portion.\n\n<<<H>>>"
