    "There is no such character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a manner that would be recognizable to readers as a reference to Romulus and Remus. While the novel centers on the conflict between the Germanic Wolfing tribe and the invading Roman army, the narrative remains focused on the Goths' perspective, their culture, and their struggle to defend their homeland.\n\nThe story introduces several key characters among the Wolfings, including their leader Thiodolf, his lover the Wood-Sun, and their daughter Hall-Sun. However, the plot does not include an episode where one of these characters travels to a Roman settlement and reports back on the intricacies of Roman mythology. The Romans are depicted as a powerful and encroaching force, but their internal culture and religious life are not a focal point of the story. Morris is more concerned with portraying the communal and heroic society of the Goths in contrast to the imperial power of Rome.\n\nScholarly analyses of *The House of the Wolfings* highlight its themes of fellowship versus empire, the idealization of a pre-industrial society, and its influence on later fantasy writers like J.R.R. Tolkien. These analyses do not mention any significant engagement with or detailed depiction of Roman religious traditions within the text.\n\nIn conclusion, a character who visits a Roman city and makes an allusion to the legend of Romulus and Remus is not a feature of William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n\n<<<There is no such character in William Morris's The House of the Wolfings.>>>"
