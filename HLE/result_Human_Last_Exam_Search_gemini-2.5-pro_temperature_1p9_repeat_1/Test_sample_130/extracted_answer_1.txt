When the local median operator is applied iteratively to a binary image, the edges of the image will evolve such that straight edges are largely preserved, while sharp corners are rounded off. The image will eventually converge to a "root" state that is stable under further applications of the filter. This final state will have smoother boundaries, with convex shapes being eroded and small, isolated features removed.
