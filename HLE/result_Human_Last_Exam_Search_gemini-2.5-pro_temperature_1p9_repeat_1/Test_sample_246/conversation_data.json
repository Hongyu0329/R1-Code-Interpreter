    "The fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is determined by first understanding the fundamental group of the complement of the knot and then relating it to the group of the branched cover.\n\nThe 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is a knotted 2-sphere in the 4-sphere, which we denote as Σ. The fundamental group of the complement of this knot, π₁(S⁴ \\ Σ), was described by E. C. Zeeman. It is the direct product of the binary dodecahedral group and the integers: π₁(S⁴ \\ Σ) ≅ I* × ℤ. The binary dodecahedral group, I*, is also known as SL(2,5) and has an order of 120. The ℤ factor is generated by a meridian of the knot.\n\nThe fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ over a knotted surface Σ is the quotient of the fundamental group of the complement of the surface by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian element (m²).\n\nGiven π₁(S⁴ \\ Σ) ≅ I* × ℤ, and letting the generator of the ℤ factor be the meridian *m*, the fundamental group of the double branched cover, which we'll call M, is:\nπ₁(M) = (I* × ℤ) / <<m²>>\n\nSince *m* is in the center of the direct product, this quotient simplifies to:\nπ₁(M) ≅ I* × (ℤ / 2ℤ) ≅ I* × Z₂\n\nNow, we must find the minimal number of generators for the group I* × Z₂.\n1.  The binary dodecahedral group I* is non-abelian and can be generated by two elements. For example, it has a presentation <x, y | (xy)² = x³ = y⁵>. Thus, its minimal number of generators is 2.\n2.  The cyclic group of order 2, Z₂, is generated by one element.\n\nFor a direct product of finite groups G₁ × G₂, the minimal number of generators, d(G₁ × G₂), is less than or equal to d(G₁) + d(G₂). However, in this case, we can show that d(I* × Z₂) = 2. Let I* = <a,b> and Z₂ = <z|z²=1>. The set of two elements {(a, 1), (b, z)} generates I* × Z₂. The commutator of these generators, [(a, 1), (b, z)] = (aba⁻¹b⁻¹, 1), lies in the subgroup I* × {1}. Since the binary dodecahedral group I* is perfect (equal to its own commutator subgroup), the commutators generate all of I* × {1}. As the set of generators also includes (b, z), which is not in I* × {1}, the two generators are sufficient to generate the entire group I* × Z₂.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
