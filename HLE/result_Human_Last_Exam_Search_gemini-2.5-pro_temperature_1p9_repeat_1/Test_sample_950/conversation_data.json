    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of an abelian group is, by definition, zero. The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, and its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is a finitely generated abelian group.\n\nAn abelian group can be decomposed into a free part and a torsion part. The rank of the group refers to the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ copies in its free part. The torsion subgroup consists of all elements of finite order. A torsion group, by definition, has no free part, and therefore its rank is 0.\n\nFor context, the integral cohomology of the real Grassmannian $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is not torsion-free. All of its torsion is 2-torsion. For example, the cohomology group in degree 4 is $H^4(G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, the torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring is a non-trivial group, but as a torsion group, its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
