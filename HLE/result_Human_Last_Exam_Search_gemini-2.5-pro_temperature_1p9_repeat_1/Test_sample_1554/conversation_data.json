    "Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy, is the thinker who analyzed the concept of a sign, or \"indication,\" by breaking it down into \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n\nIn his semiotic analyses, Ajdukiewicz explored how signs function and relate to the reality they signify. According to his framework, the state of affairs expressed in one sentence can be an \"indication\" of the state of affairs in another. This broad notion of indication is then further decomposed.\n\nA \"symptom\" is a natural sign, where the connection between the sign and what it signifies is causal or based on natural correlation. For instance, smoke is a symptom of fire. On the other hand, a \"signal\" is an artificial or conventional sign. The relationship between a signal and its meaning is established by agreement or convention, such as a traffic light signaling when it is safe to proceed.\n\nThis distinction was part of the Lviv-Warsaw School's broader project of applying logical and analytical methods to philosophical problems, including the philosophy of language and the theory of signs. While the term \"hallmark\" is not a direct translation of Ajdukiewicz's specific terminology, his concept of \"indication\" serves a similar function as a characteristic mark that points to something else, and it is this notion that he decomposes into symptoms and signals.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
