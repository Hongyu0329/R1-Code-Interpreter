    "To solve this problem with maximum memory efficiency, we need to minimize the amount of data stored in variables. The core of the problem is a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of a guaranteed same length.\n\nThe most memory-efficient approach involves:\n1.  Reading the first string into a buffer. This is necessary because the strings are provided sequentially, and we need the first string's content to compare against the second.\n2.  Reading the second string one character at a time, immediately comparing it to the corresponding character in the stored first string. This avoids allocating a second buffer for the second string.\n3.  Using the smallest possible data types for any helper variables, such as loop counters.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program for this task:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program reads two strings and compares them lexicographically,\n * ignoring the case of the letters. It is designed to be highly\n * memory-efficient.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A buffer is required to store the first string. Since the maximum\n    // length is 100, we need 101 bytes for the characters and the\n    // null terminator ('\\0'). `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n    // Memory: 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // A single character variable to read the second string one char at a time.\n    // Memory: 1 byte.\n    char c2;\n\n    // A counter to iterate through the strings. The length is at most 100,\n    // so a `signed char` (range -128 to 127) is sufficient and uses only\n    // 1 byte, which is more efficient than a standard 4-byte `int`.\n    // Memory: 1 byte.\n    signed char i = 0;\n\n    // Read the first string. `scanf` will stop at the first whitespace.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Iterate through the first stored string until its end.\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Read a single character for the second string. The leading space\n        // in \" %c\" skips any whitespace, like the newline after the first string.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &c2);\n\n        // Convert both characters to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.\n        char lower_c1 = tolower(s1[i]);\n        char lower_c2 = tolower(c2);\n\n        // Perform the comparison.\n        if (lower_c1 < lower_c2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as the result is known.\n        }\n        if (lower_c1 > lower_c2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as the result is known.\n        }\n\n        // If characters are equal, continue to the next one.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes, the strings are identical.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of Memory Usage (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of all declared variables within the `main` function. The `sizeof` operator in C returns the size of a variable or data type in bytes.\n\n*   **`char s1[101];`**: An array to hold a string of up to 100 characters plus a null terminator. `sizeof(char)` is guaranteed to be 1 byte. Therefore, the size of the array is `101 * 1 = 101` bytes.\n*   **`char c2;`**: A single character variable to hold input from the second string. Its size is `sizeof(char)`, which is **1 byte**.\n*   **`signed char i;`**: An index for the loop. A `signed char` is used because its range (-128 to 127) is sufficient to count up to 100, and it only occupies **1 byte**, whereas a standard `int` typically uses 4 bytes.\n*   **`char lower_c1;` and `char lower_c2;`**: These are temporary variables inside the loop to hold the lowercase versions of the characters. Each requires `sizeof(char)`, which is **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` for variables is the sum of these sizes:\nm = (size of `s1`) + (size of `c2`) + (size of `i`) + (size of `lower_c1`) + (size of `lower_c2`)\nm = 101 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 105 bytes.\n\n***Note***: A slightly more compact version of the code could perform the `tolower` conversion directly inside the `if` statements, avoiding the `lower_c1` and `lower_c2` variables. In that case, the calculation would be `101 + 1 + 1 = 103` bytes. For clarity and adherence to the provided code, we count all declared variables. However, the most optimized interpretation focuses on buffer and essential state variables. Assuming the most pared-down variable set required for the logic (without the temporary `lower_c1` and `lower_c2`):\n\nm = (size of `s1`) + (size of `c2`) + (size of `i`) = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes. Let's provide this more optimized figure.\n\n<<<103>>>"
