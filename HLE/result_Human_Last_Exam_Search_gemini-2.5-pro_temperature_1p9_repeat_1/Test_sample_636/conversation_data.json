    "To calculate the state feedback gain `F` that places the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A + BF` at desired locations, we can use the pole placement technique. There are several methods to achieve this, including direct substitution and Ackermann's formula.\n\nGiven the matrices:\n`A = [-1 1; 1 0]`\n`B = [1 2; 1 0]`\n\nAnd the desired eigenvalues:\n`λ₁,₂ = -1 ± j`\n\nThe state feedback law is given by `u = -Fx`, where `F = [f₁ f₂]`. The closed-loop system is then described by:\n`x_dot = (A - BF)x`\nLet's first define the matrices and the desired eigenvalues.\n\nThe characteristic equation of a system with eigenvalues `λ₁` and `λ₂` is given by `(s - λ₁)(s - λ₂) = 0`.\nFor the desired eigenvalues `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`, the desired characteristic equation is:\n`(s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j)) = (s + 1 - j)(s + 1 + j) = (s + 1)² - j² = s² + 2s + 1 + 1 = s² + 2s + 2 = 0`\n\nNow, let's find the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system `A + BF`. First, we calculate `A + BF`:\nLet `F = [f₁ f₂]`\n`BF = [1 2; 1 0] * [f₁ f₂] = [f₁ + 2f₁ f₂ + 2f₂; f₁ f₂]` is incorrect.\n\nLet `F` be a 2x2 matrix since B is 2x2. No, the control input `u` is a scalar, so `F` must be a 1x2 matrix.  Assuming `u` is a scalar and the state vector `x` is 2x1, then `F` must be a 1x2 matrix. However, the dimensions of B (2x2) suggest that the control input `u` is a 2x1 vector. In this case, F would be a 2x2 matrix. Let's assume the standard state-space representation where `u` is an m-dimensional vector and `B` is an n x m matrix. Here n=2. If B is 2x2, then m=2. Therefore `F` must be a 2x2 matrix.\n\nLet's assume the state-feedback law is `u = -Kx`. Since `B` is 2x2, the input `u` must be a 2x1 vector. Then the feedback gain matrix `K` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let\n`K = [k₁ k₂; k₃ k₄]`\nThe closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A - BK`. Let's assume the problem meant `u=-Fx` where `F` is the feedback gain matrix.  Let's stick to the notation in the problem statement `A + BF`. This means `u = Fx`.\n`BF = [1 2; 1 0] * [f₁₁ f₁₂; f₂₁ f₂₂] = [f₁₁ + 2f₂₁ f₁₂ + 2f₂₂; f₁₁ f₁₂]`\n`A + BF = [-1 1; 1 0] + [f₁₁ + 2f₂₁ f₁₂ + 2f₂₂; f₁₁ f₁₂] = [-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁ 1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂; 1 + f₁₁ f₁₂]`\n\nThe characteristic equation of `A + BF` is `det(sI - (A + BF)) = 0`.\n`sI - (A + BF) = [s - (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁) - (1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂); - (1 + f₁₁) s - f₁₂]`\n`det(sI - (A + BF)) = (s + 1 - f₁₁ - 2f₂₁)(s - f₁₂) - (-(1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂))(-(1 + f₁₁))`\n`= s² - sf₁₂ + s - f₁₂ - sf₁₁ + f₁₁f₁₂ + sf₁₁ - f₁₁f₁₂ - 2sf₂₁ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - (1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂)(1 + f₁₁) `\n`= s² + s(1 - f₁₂ - 2f₂₁) - f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ - 2sf₂₁ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - (1 + f₁₁ + f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₂₂ + 2f₁₁f₂₂) `\n`= s² + s(1 - f₁₂ - 2f₂₁) - f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₁₂f₂₁ - 1 - f₁₁ - f₁₂ - f₁₁f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂`\nThis seems overly complicated and suggests there might be a misunderstanding of the problem's formulation. Let's reconsider the dimensions of the input `u`. It's more common for a system like this to have a single input `u`, which would make `B` a 2x1 vector. Given `B` as a 2x2 matrix, let's re-read the problem statement carefully. \"Calculate state feedback gain F so that A + BF has eigenvalues at -1 \\pm j.\" It doesn't specify if u is a scalar or a vector. If `B` is `[1; 1]` and the second column of B is irrelevant or a typo, let's proceed with that assumption as it's a more standard problem. Let `B = [1; 1]`.\n\nThen `F` would be a 1x2 matrix, `F = [f₁ f₂]`.\n`BF = [1; 1] * [f₁ f₂] = [f₁ f₂; f₁ f₂]`\n`A + BF = [-1 1; 1 0] + [f₁ f₂; f₁ f₂] = [-1+f₁ 1+f₂; 1+f₁ f₂]`\nThe characteristic equation of `A + BF` is `det(sI - (A+BF)) = 0`.\n`sI - (A+BF) = [s - (-1+f₁) -(1+f₂); -(1+f₁) s - f₂]`\n`det = (s+1-f₁)(s-f₂) - (-(1+f₂))(-(1+f₁))`\n`= s² -sf₂ + s - f₂ - sf₁ + f₁f₂ - (1+f₁+f₂+f₁f₂)`\n`= s² + s(1-f₁-f₂) - f₂ - f₁f₂ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂`\n`= s² + s(1-f₁-f₂) - (1+f₁+2f₂)`.\nBy comparing the coefficients with the desired characteristic equation `s² + 2s + 2 = 0`, we have:\n`1 - f₁ - f₂ = 2  => f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n`-(1 + f₁ + 2f₂) = 2 => f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations:\n1) `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n2) `f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\nSubtracting equation (1) from (2):\n`(f₁ + 2f₂) - (f₁ + f₂) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f₂ = -2`\nSubstituting `f₂ = -2` into equation (1):\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1 => f₁ = 1`\nSo, `F = [1 -2]`.\n\nLet's assume the problem statement is correct and `B` is indeed `[1 2; 1 0]`. For multi-input systems, the state feedback gain matrix `F` is not unique. Let's choose one of the inputs. Let `u = [u₁; 0]`. Then we are effectively using `B_new = [1; 1]`. We have already solved this case.  The gain for the full `u` vector `[u₁; u₂]` would be `F = [1 -2; 0 0]`. Let's check this.\n`BF = [1 2; 1 0] * [1 -2; 0 0] = [1 -2; 1 -2]`\n`A + BF = [-1 1; 1 0] + [1 -2; 1 -2] = [0 -1; 2 -2]`\n`det(sI - (A+BF)) = det([s 1; -2 s+2]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s² + 2s + 2`.\nThe eigenvalues are indeed at `-1 ± j`. So this is one possible solution.\n\nAnother possibility is to use the second input, `u = [0; u₂]`. Let `B_new = [2; 0]`.\n`F = [0 0; f₁ f₂]`.\n`BF = [1 2; 1 0] * [0 0; f₁ f₂] = [2f₁ 2f₂; 0 0]`.\n`A + BF = [-1+2f₁ 1+2f₂; 1 0]`\n`det(sI-(A+BF)) = det([s+1-2f₁ -(1+2f₂); -1 s]) = s(s+1-2f₁) - (-(1+2f₂))(-1)`\n`= s² + s(1-2f₁) - (1+2f₂)`\nComparing coefficients with `s² + 2s + 2 = 0`:\n`1-2f₁ = 2 => 2f₁ = -1 => f₁ = -0.5`\n`-(1+2f₂) = 2 => 1+2f₂ = -2 => 2f₂ = -3 => f₂ = -1.5`\nSo, another possible solution is `F = [0 0; -0.5 -1.5]`.\n\nLet's try a direct computation without simplifying `B`. As there are more unknowns than equations, we have freedom to choose some of the values. Let `f₂₁ = 0` and `f₂₂ = 0`. Then `F = [f₁₁ f₁₂; 0 0]`.\n`BF = [1 2; 1 0] * [f₁₁ f₁₂; 0 0] = [f₁₁ f₁₂; f₁₁ f₁₂]`\n`A+BF = [-1+f₁₁ 1+f₁₂; 1+f₁₁ f₁₂]`\nThis is the same as our first case where `f₁ = f₁₁` and `f₂ = f₁₂`.\nSo, `f₁₁ = 1` and `f₁₂ = -2`.\nA valid `F` is `[1 -2; 0 0]`.\n\nSince the question asks to \"Calculate state feedback gain F\" and the solution is not unique for a multi-input system, providing one valid solution should be sufficient. I will present the first solution.\n\nFinal verification:\nA = [[-1, 1],]\nB = [,]\nF = [[1, -2],]\nA_plus_BF = A + B@F = [[-1, 1],] + [,] @ [[1, -2],] = [[-1, 1],] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]\nCharacteristic equation: det(sI - A_plus_BF) = det([[s, 1], [-2, s+2]]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s^2 + 2s + 2.\nThe roots of s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0 are s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 - 4*1*2)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = -1 ± j.\nThe result is correct.\nThe problem as stated with a 2x2 B matrix leads to a non-unique solution for F. By assuming that the second input is not used (or setting the second row of F to zero), a valid solution is found. This is a reasonable approach when faced with an underdetermined system. I will provide this result.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward. I have verified the result and the methodology. I'm ready to provide the final answer.To solve this problem, we need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A + BF` are at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nThe given matrices are:\n`A = [-1  1]`\n    `[ 1  0]`\n\n`B = [1  2]`\n    `[1  0]`\n\nThe state feedback law is `u = Fx`, which leads to the closed-loop system `ẋ = (A + BF)x`. The feedback gain `F` for a multi-input system (where the control input `u` is a vector) is generally not unique. Since the state vector `x` is 2x1 and the input matrix `B` is 2x2, the control input `u` must be a 2x1 vector and the feedback gain matrix `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let `F` be:\n\n`F = [f₁₁ f₁₂]`\n    `[f₂₁ f₂₂]`\n\nThe desired characteristic equation based on the desired eigenvalues `λ = -1 ± j` is:\n`p(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j)) = (s + 1 - j)(s + 1 + j) = (s + 1)² - j² = s² + 2s + 2 = 0`\n\nThe characteristic equation of the closed-loop system `A + BF` is given by `det(sI - (A + BF)) = 0`.\n\nLet's compute `A + BF`:\n`BF = [1  2] [f₁₁ f₁₂] = [f₁₁ + 2f₂₁  f₁₂ + 2f₂₂]`\n     `[1  0] [f₂₁ f₂₂]   [    f₁₁           f₁₂     ]`\n\n`A + BF = [-1  1] + [f₁₁ + 2f₂₁  f₁₂ + 2f₂₂] = [-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁   1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂]`\n         `[ 1  0]   [    f₁₁           f₁₂     ]   [    1 + f₁₁              f₁₂     ]`\n\nNow, we find the characteristic equation of `A + BF`:\n`det(sI - (A + BF)) = det([s - (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁)   -(1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂)]`\n                           `[    -(1 + f₁₁)           s - f₁₂         ])`\n`= (s + 1 - f₁₁ - 2f₂₁)(s - f₁₂) - (-(1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂))(-(1 + f₁₁))`\n`= s² - s*f₁₂ + s(1 - f₁₁ - 2f₂₁) - f₁₂(1 - f₁₁ - 2f₂₁) - (1 + f₁₁)(1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂)`\n`= s² + s(1 - f₁₁ - 2f₂₁ - f₁₂) - f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - (1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂ + f₁₁ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₁₁f₂₂)`\n`= s² + s(1 - f₁₁ - f₁₂ - 2f₂₁) + (-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂)`\n\nEquating the coefficients of this polynomial with the desired characteristic polynomial `s² + 2s + 2 = 0`:\n1) `1 - f₁₁ - f₁₂ - 2f₂₁ = 2`\n2) `-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ = 2`\n\nWe have two equations and four unknowns, confirming the non-uniqueness of the solution. We can assign values to some of the variables to find a specific solution. Let's simplify the problem by setting `f₂₁ = 0` and `f₂₂ = 0`. This is equivalent to only using the first control input.\n\nThe equations become:\n1) `1 - f₁₁ - f₁₂ = 2  => f₁₁ + f₁₂ = -1`\n2) `-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ = 2 => f₁₁ + 2f₁₂ = -3`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n`f₁₁ + f₁₂ = -1`\n`f₁₁ + 2f₁₂ = -3`\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n`(f₁₁ + 2f₁₂) - (f₁₁ + f₁₂) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f₁₂ = -2`\n\nSubstituting `f₁₂ = -2` into the first equation:\n`f₁₁ + (-2) = -1 => f₁₁ = 1`\n\nThus, a valid state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [1 -2]`\n    `[0  0]`\n\nWe can verify this solution:\n`A + BF = [-1 1] + [1 2][1 -2] = [-1 1] + [1 -2] = [0 -1]`\n         `[ 1 0]   [1 0][0  0]   [ 1 0]   [1 -2]   [2 -2]`\n\nThe characteristic equation of this closed-loop matrix is:\n`det(sI - [0 -1]) = det([s  1]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s² + 2s + 2`\n         `[2 -2]       [-2 s+2]`\nThis matches the desired characteristic equation.\n\n<<<\nF = [1, -2; 0, 0]\n>>>"
