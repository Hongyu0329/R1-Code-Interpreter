    "A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is a quantum channel that can be expressed in the form:\n$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $\nwhere $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the generalized Pauli operators, which form a basis for the space of operators on the $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$. The coefficients $p_k$ are non-negative probabilities that sum to one, i.e., $\\sum_k p_k = 1$. The operators $U_k$ are unitary and orthogonal with respect to the trace inner product: $\\text{Tr}(U_j^\\dagger U_k) = d \\cdot \\delta_{jk}$.\n\nThe channel action can be described using a set of Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, where $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_k A_k \\rho A_k^\\dagger$. For a Pauli channel, we can choose the Kraus operators to be $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted as $\\Lambda^c$, describes the information that leaks to the environment. If a channel $\\Lambda$ has Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is given by:\n$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k} \\text{Tr}(A_k \\rho A_j^\\dagger) |j\\rangle\\langle k| $\nHere, $\\{|k\\rangle\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for an auxiliary environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ whose dimension is equal to the number of Kraus operators. For a generic Pauli channel, there can be up to $d^2$ non-zero probabilities $p_k$, so the environment can have a dimension of $d^2$.\n\nSubstituting the Kraus operators for the Pauli channel, we get:\n$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_j p_k} \\text{Tr}(U_k \\rho U_j^\\dagger) |j\\rangle\\langle k| $\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the dimension of the space of its output operators. To find the maximal rank of $\\Lambda^c$, we can choose the parameters $p_k$ of the Pauli channel to maximize this dimension. The maximum is achieved when all $p_k$ are non-zero, which is possible (e.g., for the completely depolarizing channel).\n\nLet's assume $p_k > 0$ for all $k = 0, \\dots, d^2-1$. The input to the channel is the space of $d \\times d$ density matrices, which is a subspace of all $d \\times d$ matrices. This space of operators has dimension $d^2$, and a basis is given by the Pauli operators $\\{U_l\\}_{l=0}^{d^2-1}$.\n\nThe rank of $\\Lambda^c$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by the output operators $\\{\\Lambda^c(U_l)\\}_{l=0}^{d^2-1}$. Let's test for the linear independence of these $d^2$ output operators.\nSuppose there is a linear combination that equals zero:\n$ \\sum_{l=0}^{d^2-1} c_l \\Lambda^c(U_l) = 0 $\nThis means that for every pair of indices $(j, k)$, the corresponding matrix element is zero:\n$ \\sum_{l=0}^{d^2-1} c_l \\sqrt{p_j p_k} \\text{Tr}(U_k U_l U_j^\\dagger) = 0 $\nSince we assumed all $p_k > 0$, we can divide by $\\sqrt{p_j p_k}$:\n$ \\sum_{l=0}^{d^2-1} c_l \\text{Tr}(U_k U_l U_j^\\dagger) = 0 $\nLet's define a new operator $X = \\sum_l c_l U_l$. The condition becomes:\n$ \\text{Tr}((U_j^\\dagger U_k)^\\dagger X) = 0 \\quad \\forall j,k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d^2-1\\} $\nThis means that the operator $X$ is orthogonal to every operator in the set $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k\\}$ under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. The set of operators $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ forms a basis for the space of all operators. For any fixed $j$, the set $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ also forms a basis, because multiplication by a fixed invertible operator ($U_j^\\dagger$) is an invertible linear transformation.\nSince the set $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k\\}_{j,k}$ contains a basis for the entire operator space, the condition $\\text{Tr}((U_j^\\dagger U_k)^\\dagger X) = 0$ for all $j,k$ implies that $X$ must be the zero operator.\n\nSo, $X = \\sum_l c_l U_l = 0$. As the Pauli operators $\\{U_l\\}$ are linearly independent, this implies that all coefficients $c_l$ must be zero.\nThis shows that the $d^2$ output operators $\\{\\Lambda^c(U_l)\\}_{l=0}^{d^2-1}$ are linearly independent. The dimension of the space spanned by these operators is therefore $d^2$.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is the dimension of its output space, which is $d^2$. The rank cannot exceed the dimension of the input operator space, which is also $d^2$. Therefore, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
