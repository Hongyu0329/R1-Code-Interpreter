    "The first homology group of a space is the abelianization of its fundamental group. The problem asks for the computation of $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Moduli Space\n\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis of two linearly independent vectors, which can form the columns of a matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Two such matrices, $M_1$ and $M_2$, define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis, which is given by an integer matrix with determinant $\\pm 1$. That is, $M_1 = M_2 A$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by the absolute value of the determinant of the basis matrix, $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of unit area restricts the space of basis matrices to those with $|\\det(M)| = 1$. This set of matrices is denoted by $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nTherefore, the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, denoted by $X$, is the quotient space $X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### 2. Relating Homology of the Space to Group Homology\n\nFor a wide class of spaces constructed as quotients of a Lie group by a discrete subgroup, there is a strong connection between the homology of the space and the group homology of the discrete group. In particular, for the space $X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the Borel-Serre theorem implies that their homology groups with rational coefficients are isomorphic. This isomorphism often extends to integer coefficients for the first homology group, giving us:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe first homology group of a group $\\Gamma$ is the abelianization of that group, denoted $\\Gamma^{ab}$. Thus, we need to compute the abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### 3. Computing the Abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nThe group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ fits into a short exact sequence:\n$1 \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\det} \\{\\pm 1\\} \\to 1$.\n\nThis sequence splits, meaning that $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a semi-direct product $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The action of the non-trivial element of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ on $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is given by conjugation with any matrix in $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with determinant -1, for example, $J = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe abelianization of a semi-direct product $G \\rtimes H$ is given by $(G_{ab})_H \\oplus H_{ab}$, where $(G_{ab})_H$ denotes the coinvariants of the action of $H$ on the abelianization of $G$, and $H_{ab}$ is the abelianization of $H$.\n\n1.  **Abelianization of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$:** The group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by the matrices $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Its abelianization is known to be the cyclic group of order 12.\n    $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n2.  **Action on the abelianization:** We need to determine the action of the conjugation by $J$ on $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab}$. This action sends each generator of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ to its inverse:\n    *   $J S J^{-1} = S^{-1}$\n    *   $J T J^{-1} = T^{-1}$\n    This means the induced action on the abelian group $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ is multiplication by -1.\n\n3.  **Coinvariants:** The coinvariants $((\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}))_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}$ are calculated as the quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ by the submodule generated by elements of the form $g - \\phi(g)$, where $\\phi$ is the action. In our case, this is $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ modulo elements of the form $u - (-u) = 2u$. The resulting quotient group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}) / (2\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n4.  **Abelianization of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$:** The group $H = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is already abelian, so $H_{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is:\n$GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z})_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThis result for the abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is confirmed in the mathematical literature.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, which is the Klein four-group.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$>>>"
