    "Once a single-dose ampule is punctured, it must be used immediately, and any remaining contents must be discarded. There is no permissible beyond-use date (BUD) for an opened ampule, even within a sterile environment.\n\nAccording to the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA), no storage of an open ampule is permitted, and therefore, no BUD applies. This is because ampules are designed for single use and cannot be sealed after being opened, which significantly increases the risk of microbial contamination. The contents should be withdrawn immediately after opening, and any unused portion must be discarded.\n\nThis guidance is distinct from the rules for single-dose *vials*, which may have a limited BUD under specific sterile conditions. For ampules, however, the instruction is unequivocal: use immediately and discard the remainder.\n\n<<<Immediately, with no storage permitted.>>>"
