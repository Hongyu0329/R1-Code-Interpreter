In the limit as the arc-length parameter separation |s′−s| approaches zero, the generating function H(s,s′) for planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics can be expressed as an asymptotic expansion. Let s' = s+h. The leading-order behavior is given by H(s, s+h) ≈ -h - (κ(s)²/24)h³, where h = |s'−s| and κ(s) is the local curvature of the boundary at s. The leading term, -h, corresponds to the negative arc-length separation, while the first-order correction, which is of order h³, is proportional to the square of the curvature. This demonstrates that the boundary's curvature introduces a third-order "twist" to the dynamics in this asymptotic regime, directly linking the geometry of the billiard table to its dynamical properties near the boundary.
