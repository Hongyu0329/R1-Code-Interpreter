    "This sequence does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. Upon analyzing the differences between consecutive numbers, no consistent pattern emerges.\n\nHowever, a key characteristic of the sequence is that all of its numbers are divisible by 6. The given sequence is a subsequence of the four-digit numbers divisible by 6, but it omits many numbers from that parent sequence without a clear rule.\n\nGiven the lack of a discernible mathematical pattern, it's not possible to determine the next number with absolute certainty. Any subsequent number would be based on an assumed pattern. The simplest assumption is that the sequence continues with the next number divisible by 6.\n\nThe last number in the sequence is 2352. The next number that is divisible by 6 is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
