The order type of the set X, after removing duplicate values (specifically, δ = γ+δ), is the number of distinct elements when they are placed in ascending order. Based on the properties of ordinal arithmetic, the strict ascending order of the unique elements of X is:

0 < 1 < γ < γ<sup>γ</sup> < δ < δ+γ < γ·δ < δ·γ < δ<sup>γ</sup> < γ<sup>δ</sup>

The unique elements are:
1.  0
2.  1
3.  γ
4.  γ<sup>γ</sup>
5.  δ (which is equal to γ+δ)
6.  δ+γ
7.  γ⋅δ
8.  δ⋅γ
9.  δ<sup>γ</sup>
10. γ<sup>δ</sup>

There are 10 distinct elements in the set X. The order type of a finite well-ordered set is its cardinality.

Thus, the order type of X is 10.
