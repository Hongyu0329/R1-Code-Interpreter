    "There is one cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the analysis of the amino acid sequence of the human γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit ρ-1 (GABAAρ1), available from the UniProt database under the accession number P24046.\n\nThe transmembrane domains (TMs) are defined as follows:\n*   TM3: positions 377-397\n*   TM4: positions 453-473\n\nThe linker region between TM3 and TM4 therefore spans from amino acid position 398 to 452. The sequence for this linker region is:\n`LRGVSWRKAAQLQRRSSASQRASRICLQNRLQERDAAVAASTSATSASNTSTSATTSSASV`\n\nWithin this sequence, a single cysteine (C) residue is present.\n\n<<<1>>>"
