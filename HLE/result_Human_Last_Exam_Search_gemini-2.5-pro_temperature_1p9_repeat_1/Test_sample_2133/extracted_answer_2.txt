This question cannot be answered because the terms "Mercer matrix" and "logarithmic $ {\mu} _{\infin} $ norm" are not standard mathematical definitions. Without precise definitions for these terms, it is impossible to identify the matrix $M_n$ that maximizes the specified ratio and to determine its largest immanant.
