The density profile \( \rho(z) \) of the gas mixture is determined by the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, where the pressure gradient balances the force of gravity \( \left(\frac{dP}{dz} = -\rho(z)g\right) \), and the pressure is given by the van der Waals equation of state for an interacting gas mixture. This leads to a system of coupled non-linear differential equations for the individual gas densities, \( c_A(z) \) and \( c_B(z) \), which cannot be solved analytically to provide a closed-form expression for the total density \( \rho(z) = M_A c_A(z) + M_B c_B(z) \). The profile must be determined through numerical methods, using the provided van der Waals parameters and satisfying the constraints on the total number of particles in the container.
