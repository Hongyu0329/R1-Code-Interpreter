    "For the finite group PSU(4,997), which is the projective special unitary group of degree 4 over the finite field with 997² elements, the number of involutions is determined by the number and size of its conjugacy classes of involutions. An involution is an element of the group that is its own inverse.\n\nFor a prime power *q*, the group PSU(4,*q*) where *q* is odd has precisely two conjugacy classes of involutions. The total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\nThe size of a conjugacy class of an element *x* in a group *G* is given by the formula |*G*| / |C*G*(*x*)|, where |*G*| is the order of the group and |C*G*(*x*)| is the order of the centralizer of *x*.\n\nThe order of the group PSU(n,*q*) is given by the formula:\n|PSU(n,q)| = q^(n(n-1)/2) * Π (from i=2 to n) (q^i - (-1)^i) / gcd(n, q+1)\n\nFor PSU(4,997), the parameters are n=4 and q=997. The order of the group is:\n|PSU(4,997)| = 997^(4*3/2) * (997² - 1)(997³ + 1)(997⁴ - 1) / gcd(4, 997+1)\n|PSU(4,997)| = 997⁶ * (997² - 1)(997³ + 1)(997⁴ - 1) / 2\n\nTo find the total number of involutions, one would need the orders of the centralizers for an element from each of the two conjugacy classes of involutions. While academic sources, such as a paper by D. K. Phan, describe the structure of these centralizers, the exact orders are not clearly and unambiguously provided in the available search snippets. The centralizer of one class of involutions is related to a subgroup of the form GL(2,q²), while the centralizer of the other class is more complex.\n\nWithout the precise orders of these two centralizers, a final numerical calculation of the number of involutions is not possible from the provided search results."
