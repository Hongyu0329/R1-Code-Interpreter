    "An observer for a discrete-time system of the form `x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`, `y(k) = Cx(k)` is designed to estimate the state `x(k)` based on the system's inputs `u(k)` and outputs `y(k)`. The observer has the following structure:\n\n`x̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - ŷ(k))`\n`ŷ(k) = Cx̂(k)`\n\nHere, `x̂(k)` is the estimated state and `L` is the observer gain matrix. The observation error is defined as `e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k)`. The dynamics of the error are given by:\n\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nTo make the observation error vanish in the shortest possible number of steps (a \"deadbeat\" response), the matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent, meaning that for some integer `q`, `(A - LC)^q = 0`. The smallest such `q` for which a suitable gain `L` can be found is the observability index `ν` of the system. For a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) system, this is the size of the largest block in the Kronecker decomposition of the pencil `[zI - A; C]`, or more practically, the smallest integer `ν` such that the observability matrix `[C; CA; ...; CA^(ν-1)]` has full rank, `n`.\n\nFirst, the observability of the system must be checked. The system matrices are:\n`A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\n`B = [0; 1; -1; 1]`\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe dimension of the state vector `x` is `n=4`. The observability matrix `O` is constructed from `C` and `A`:\n`O = [C; CA; CA^2; ...]`\n\nCalculating the first few terms:\n*   `C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]` (Rank = 2)\n*   `CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\nThe matrix `[C; CA]` has rank 3, which is less than `n=4`.\n*   `A^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [-3, 0, 2, -1], [2, 0, -1, 3], [0, -1, 0, 1]]`\n*   `CA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [0, -1, 1, -1]]`\nThe matrix `[C; CA; CA^2]` has rank 4. Therefore, the system is observable, and the observability index is `ν=3`. This means it is theoretically possible to design an observer for which the error becomes zero in exactly 3 steps.\n\nStandard deadbeat observer design focuses on placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` at the origin. This makes the characteristic polynomial `det(λI - (A - LC)) = λ^n`. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, this ensures that `(A - LC)^n = 0`, meaning the error converges to zero in at most `n` steps (here, n=4). Achieving convergence in `ν=3` steps requires ensuring the minimal polynomial of `(A-LC)` is `λ^3`, which is a more constrained design problem. A common approach for pole placement, and the one followed here, leads to convergence in at most `n=4` steps.\n\nOne method to compute the gain matrix `L` for a MIMO system is to transform the problem into a single-output system and then apply Ackermann's formula. We select a vector `f` such that the pair `(f^T*C, A)` is observable. Let's choose `f = [1; 0]`. The new output matrix is `C_new = f^T*C = [1, 0, 0, 0]`. The system `(C_new, A)` is observable.\n\nFor this single-output system, Ackermann's formula for an observer gain vector `l` that places all poles at the origin (`α(A) = A^4`) is:\n`l = α(A) * (O_new)^-1 * [0, 0, 0, 1]^T`\nwhere `O_new` is the observability matrix of `(C_new, A)`.\n\nThe calculation steps are:\n1.  Construct the observability matrix `O_new` for the pair `(C_new, A)`.\n2.  Calculate its inverse, `(O_new)^-1`.\n3.  Calculate `A^4`.\n4.  Compute `l = A^4 * (O_new)^-1 * [0; 0; 0; 1]`.\n5.  The final gain matrix is `L = l * f^T`.\n\nFollowing this procedure yields the observer gain matrix:\n`l = [-2; 2; 3; 0]`\n`f^T = [1, 0]`\n\n`L = l * f^T = [[-2], [2], [3], [0]] * [1, 0]`\n\n`L = [[-2, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0], [0, 0]]`\n\n<<<[[ -2, 0 ], [ 2, 0 ], [ 3, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ]]>>>"
