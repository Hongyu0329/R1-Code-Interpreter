    "In the framework of statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state of a system is the macroscopic configuration that is overwhelmingly the most probable. Large deviation theory provides a mathematical foundation for this principle by quantifying the exponential improbability of observing a macroscopic state that deviates from equilibrium. For a system of light quanta (photons), which are bosons, we can apply the principles of large deviation theory, specifically related to the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems, to determine the equilibrium properties.\n\n### Conceptual Framework\n\nLet's consider a system of photons in a volume $V$ at a given temperature $T$. The photons can occupy a set of discrete energy levels $\\epsilon_i$. A macroscopic state of the system can be described by the empirical distribution of photons across these energy levels, denoted by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$, or by the empirical probabilities $p_i = n_i / N$, where $N$ is the total number of photons.\n\n**Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** From a microscopic standpoint, where each photon is an independent sample, the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem states that the probability of observing an empirical distribution $p$ that is different from the true equilibrium distribution $q$ is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, or relative entropy, $D_{KL}(p||q)$:\n\n$P(\\text{empirical dist.} \\approx p) \\approx e^{-N \\cdot D_{KL}(p||q)}$\n\nThe equilibrium state is the one that minimizes this deviation probability, which corresponds to minimizing the KL divergence. Since $D_{KL}(p||q) \\geq 0$ and is zero only when $p=q$, the most probable empirical distribution is the equilibrium distribution itself.\n\n**Cramér-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem is concerned with the probability of deviations of the sample mean of a random variable from its expected value. In our context, the key observable is the energy. The mean energy of the system, $\\langle E \\rangle$, is given by $\\sum_i p_i \\epsilon_i$. The principle states that the probability of observing a mean energy that deviates from the equilibrium value is also exponentially small, governed by a rate function.\n\nThe equilibrium state is found by maximizing the statistical entropy of the system subject to the constraint of a fixed mean energy. In the large deviation framework, this is equivalent to finding the distribution $p$ that minimizes the KL divergence with respect to a reference measure (representing the available states), under the constraint that the average energy is fixed.\n\n### Derivation for the Bose Case of Light Quanta\n\nFor photons, the number of particles is not conserved. The system is in contact with a heat bath at temperature $T$, which fixes the mean energy $\\langle E \\rangle$. The statistical properties are governed by Bose-Einstein statistics. The equilibrium distribution for bosons is found by maximizing the entropy under the constraint of constant average energy.\n\nThe entropy for a bosonic system is given by:\n\n$S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (1+n_i)\\ln(1+n_i) - n_i\\ln(n_i) \\right]$\n\nWe want to maximize this entropy subject to the constraint on the total average energy:\n\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i$\n\nUsing the method of Lagrange multipliers, we define a functional $\\mathcal{L}$ with a multiplier $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n\n$\\mathcal{L} = S - k_B\\beta(\\sum_i n_i\\epsilon_i - \\langle E \\rangle)$\n\nMaximizing this with respect to $n_i$ ($\\partial \\mathcal{L} / \\partial n_i = 0$) yields the most probable distribution for the occupation numbers $n_i$:\n\n$n_i(\\epsilon_i) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n\nThis is the celebrated Planck distribution for photons (a specific case of the Bose-Einstein distribution with zero chemical potential, since the photon number is not conserved). This distribution represents the equilibrium state.\n\n#### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe mean energy of the photon gas is obtained by integrating the energy density over all frequencies. The density of states in a volume $V$ for photons (with two polarization states) between frequencies $\\nu$ and $\\nu+d\\nu$ is:\n\n$g(\\nu)d\\nu = \\frac{8\\pi V}{c^3}\\nu^2 d\\nu$\n\nThe energy of a photon is $\\epsilon = h\\nu$. The total mean energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ is then:\n\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty n(\\nu)\\epsilon(\\nu) g(\\nu)d\\nu = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{h\\nu}{e^{h\\nu/k_B T} - 1} \\frac{8\\pi V}{c^3}\\nu^2 d\\nu$\n\nThis integral evaluates to:\n\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15c^3h^3}\\right) V T^4$\n\nThis is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which shows that the mean energy is proportional to $T^4$.\n\n#### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe entropy can be calculated from the relationship between internal energy, Helmholtz free energy ($F$), and entropy ($S$): $S = (E-F)/T$. The Helmholtz free energy for a photon gas is given by $F = -k_B T \\sum_i \\ln(1+n_i)$. Substituting the equilibrium distribution and integrating over all states, we find:\n\n$F = -\\frac{1}{3}E = -\\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15c^3h^3}\\right) V T^4$\n\nFrom this, the equilibrium entropy is:\n\n$S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - F}{T} = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - (-\\frac{1}{3}\\langle E \\rangle)}{T} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15c^3h^3}\\right) V T^4 = \\left(\\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45c^3h^3}\\right) V T^3$\n\nThus, the equilibrium entropy is proportional to the volume $V$ and the cube of the temperature $T^3$.\n\n<<<**Equilibrium Mean Energy**: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15c^3h^3}\\right) V T^4$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy**: $S = \\left(\\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45c^3h^3}\\right) V T^3$"
