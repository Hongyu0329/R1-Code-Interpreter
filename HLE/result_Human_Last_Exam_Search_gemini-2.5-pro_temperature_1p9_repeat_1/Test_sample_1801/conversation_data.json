    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign for Enron were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Kenneth Arrow**.\n\nPhysicist Murray Gell-Mann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, appeared in one of the television commercials. In a 2010 talk, Gell-Mann himself recounted being asked to appear in a commercial for a company, which he identified as Enron, to discuss the importance of asking \"why\".\n\nEconomist Kenneth Arrow, a recipient of the 1972 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, was also featured in the \"Ask Why\" campaign. While his appearance is less documented in easily available online video clips, his participation is cited in discussions of Enron's marketing efforts and the broader context of its corporate culture.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Kenneth Arrow>>>"
