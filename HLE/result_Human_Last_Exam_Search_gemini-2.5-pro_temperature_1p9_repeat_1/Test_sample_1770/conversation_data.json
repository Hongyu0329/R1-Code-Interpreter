    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you should knock out a gene within the **phd gene cluster**.\n\nThis cluster is responsible for the degradation of phenylpropanoids, including p-coumaric acid, through a CoA-dependent, Î²-oxidative deacetylation pathway. Research has shown that deleting genes within this cluster, such as *phdA, phdB, phdC*, or *phdE*, eliminates the ability of *C. glutamicum* to grow on phenylpropanoid substrates, thereby preventing the degradation of the desired product.\n\nMetabolic engineering studies aimed at producing p-coumaric acid in *C. glutamicum* have successfully increased product accumulation by inactivating this phenylpropanoid degradation pathway. For instance, the deletion of the *phd* gene cluster was a key step in developing a platform strain for the production of various plant polyphenols. One study specifically mentioned the effect of a *phdA*-deletion on p-coumaric acid synthesis.\n\n<<<phd gene cluster>>>"
