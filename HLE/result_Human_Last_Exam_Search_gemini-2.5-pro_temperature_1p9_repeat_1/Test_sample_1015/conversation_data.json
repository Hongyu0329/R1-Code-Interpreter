    "The initial search results provide a general overview of the cambré derrière movement and some characteristics of the Balanchine method, such as fluid busts and numerous cambrés. However, the results lack a direct and detailed comparison of the cambré derrière between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, specifically concerning arm placement, hip placement, speed, degree of backbend, and head placement. To accurately answer the user's question, I need to find more specific information that directly contrasts these two techniques for this particular ballet step.The previous Google searches have provided a good foundation for understanding the general characteristics of the Vaganova and Balanchine methods. For Vaganova, there's an emphasis on a strong, square torso and back, and a coordinated use of the entire body, including head and arms. The cambré is described as initiating from the upper back after lifting, with specific rules for head placement to avoid strain and maintain an aesthetic line. The Balanchine method is characterized by speed, a more athletic approach, open hips in arabesque, and unconventional arm and hand positions. It also mentions a tilt of the body and crossing the centerline with the arms.\n\nHowever, a direct, explicit comparison of *cambré derrière* across all the listed options (arm placement, hip placement, speed, degree of backbend, and head placement) is still not fully detailed. For example, while hip placement in arabesque is mentioned for Balanchine, its specific action during a *cambré derrière* isn't clarified. Similarly, the speed of the *cambré* itself and the precise degree of the backbend are not explicitly contrasted. To confidently select the most accurate answer, I need to drill down into these specific elements of the *cambré derrière* in both methods.The previous searches have provided key insights into the differing philosophies of the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, which directly impact the execution of movements like cambré derrière. The Vaganova method emphasizes a stable, square torso and hips, with movement initiated from the upper back. This suggests a focus on maintaining alignment and control. In contrast, the Balanchine method allows for more freedom and dynamism, with notable characteristics including open hips in arabesque and a more fluid, less rigid torso. The search results also allude to differences in arm and head placement but haven't offered a conclusive side-by-side comparison for the cambré derrière. The element of speed in Balanchine is frequently mentioned in a general sense, and it is implied that the degree of backbend could differ due to the contrasting approaches to spinal articulation. I have enough information to analyze the options, but one more targeted search on the upper body in Balanchine's cambré might be beneficial.The comprehensive search has yielded significant details about the core principles of both the Vaganova and Balanchine methods. For the Vaganova technique, a key principle is maintaining a square torso and hips, ensuring stability and control. Movement is often described as originating from the upper back, with precise arm and head positions designed to maintain a clean, unbroken line and avoid strain. In contrast, the Balanchine method is repeatedly characterized by its speed, dynamism, and greater freedom of movement. A notable feature of the Balanchine style is the allowance of an open hip, particularly in arabesques, and a more fluid and less constricted torso. While there is information about the general philosophies, a direct, point-by-point comparison of *cambré derrière* for all the answer choices is still slightly fragmented. However, the consistent emphasis on a stable, square hip alignment in the Vaganova method versus the more dynamic and open hip in the Balanchine style is a very strong differentiator that has been highlighted in multiple search results. This provides a solid foundation to make an informed decision.\n\nA key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip. The Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso, with the shoulders and hips aligned. This principle ensures that the backbend originates from the upper and middle back, with the hips remaining firmly in place to provide a solid foundation.\n\nIn contrast, the Balanchine method allows for greater freedom and dynamism in movement, which includes a more open hip position. This technique is known for its speed and emphasis on creating long lines, and in movements like an arabesque, the hip of the working leg is allowed to lift. This philosophy of a more mobile and less rigid torso and hip placement carries through into other movements, including the cambré derrière. While other elements like arm and head placement do differ between the two styles, the fundamental approach to hip stability is a more pronounced and defining difference in the execution of a cambré derrière. The Vaganova technique prioritizes a controlled, square alignment, whereas the Balanchine style permits a more open and less restricted hip placement to achieve its characteristic dynamic and linear quality.\n\n<<<B>>>"
