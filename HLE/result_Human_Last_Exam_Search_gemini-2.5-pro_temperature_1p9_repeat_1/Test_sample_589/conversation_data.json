    "The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car is the 1995 coming-of-age movie *Now and Then*. The film was distributed by New Line Cinema, a major film studio.\n\nThe movie centers on four 12-year-old girls during a pivotal summer in 1970. The friends, Samantha, Teeny, Chrissy, and Roberta, are depicted as adventurous and often on their bicycles. The character of Roberta, played by Christina Ricci, is portrayed as a tomboy who is daring and not afraid of a challenge. Another of the girls, Chrissy, is noted for her love of the color pink.\n\nIn a memorable scene, the girls have a confrontation with the local bullies, the Wormer brothers. During this encounter, one of the girls rides her bike head-on toward a moving car in a game of \"chicken.\"\n\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
