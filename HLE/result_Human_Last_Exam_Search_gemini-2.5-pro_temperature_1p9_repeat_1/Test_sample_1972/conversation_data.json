    "Jorge Luis Borges was referring to the novel **El pozo** (*The Pit*) by the Uruguayan author **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n\nBorges wrote a prologue for the first edition of *El pozo* in 1939, in which he described the novel's power. Furthermore, Borges considered Onetti to be a notable successor to William Faulkner, albeit one who simplified the American novelist's complex style.\n\n<<<*El pozo* by Juan Carlos Onetti>>>"
