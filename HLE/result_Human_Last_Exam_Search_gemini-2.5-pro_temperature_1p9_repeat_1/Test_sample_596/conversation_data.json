    "Zero.\n\nA key result in the study of higher-dimensional forests, as established by Mukherjee, states that for any rooted forest (F, R) in a triangulated closed d-manifold, the forest F simplicially collapses onto its root R if and only if the (d-1)-th relative homology group H_d-1(F, R) is trivial.\n\nFurthermore, for any closed, orientable, triangulated manifold, it has been proven that every rooted forest simplicially collapses onto any of its roots. The Möbius band, however, is a classic example of a non-orientable surface. For non-orientable manifolds, a different rule applies.\n\nA significant theorem, also presented by Mukherjee, asserts that a non-orientable, closed, triangulated manifold cannot simplicially collapse onto any of its roots. This implies that for such manifolds, there are always rooted forests that fail to collapse. In fact, it has been shown that for a non-orientable d-manifold, the forest consisting of all d-simplices does not simplicially collapse to its root due to torsion in its (d-1)-th homology group.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the standard triangulation of the Möbius band which has a boundary. The aforementioned theorems apply to *closed* manifolds (manifolds without a boundary).\n\nWhen a manifold has a boundary, the situation changes. The standard triangulation of a Möbius band results in a surface with a single boundary curve. It has been established that any \"punctured\" closed, connected, orientable triangulated manifold simplicially collapses onto any of its roots. While a Möbius band is non-orientable, the presence of a boundary is the critical factor here.\n\nA triangulated surface with a boundary is homotopy equivalent to a lower-dimensional complex. The Möbius band, for instance, is famously homotopy equivalent to a circle. In the context of simplicial complexes, being collapsible to a point (or a root) is a strong form of contractibility. While not all contractible complexes are collapsible, it turns out that for any rooted forest (F,R) on a triangulated surface with a boundary, the forest F does indeed simplicially collapse onto its root R.\n\nTherefore, for the standard triangulation of the Möbius band, there are no higher dimensional rooted forests that fail to simplicially collapse onto their root.\n\n<<<0>>>"
