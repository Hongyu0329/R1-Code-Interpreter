After the gate Q is applied to the first ququint of the entangled pair and a measurement is performed on it, the system collapses to one of five possible final states. The outcome is probabilistic: for instance, the most likely outcome (with a probability of 3/10) is the state $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$. The complete description of the final state is the full set of these five possible outcomes with their respective probabilities.
