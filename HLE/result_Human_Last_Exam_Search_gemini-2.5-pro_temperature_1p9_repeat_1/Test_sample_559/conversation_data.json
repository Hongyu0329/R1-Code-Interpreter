    "An analysis of the system's equilibrium points and their stability reveals the nature of the phase plane. The equilibrium points in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$) are found by setting both derivatives to zero.\n\nFrom $u'(t)=(u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find equilibrium conditions at $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n1.  **For $u=1$**:\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the first equation gives $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1)$.\n    Setting $d'(t)=0$ yields $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives two equilibrium points: $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n2.  **For $u=0$**:\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the first equation gives $d'(t) = 2d^2$.\n    Setting $d'(t)=0$ yields $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\nBy linearizing the system around these points, we can classify their stability:\n*   The point $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   The point $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point.\n*   The point $(0, 0)$ is a degenerate equilibrium point.\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different dynamic behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are classic examples of separatrices. Let's find the separatrix associated with the saddle point $(-1, 1)$. We test if the function $d = -u^2$ represents a trajectory of the system.\n\nThe slope of a trajectory in the phase plane is given by the chain rule: $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$.\nIf we assume the trajectory is defined by $d = -u^2$, its slope is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\n\nNow we compute $\\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$ and substitute $d = -u^2$:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1 - u)}{(u - 1)u^2} $$\nSubstituting $d = -u^2$:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1 - u)}{(u - 1)u^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4}{(u-1)u^2} = \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{(u-1)u^2} $$\nFactoring the numerator gives:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u $$\n\nSince both methods for calculating the slope yield $-2u$, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact trajectory of the system. This trajectory connects the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$. As this curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point, it acts as a separatrix for the system.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
