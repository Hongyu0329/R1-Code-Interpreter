    "The logic of the puzzle is based on the movement of the number '2'. A careful analysis of the provided examples reveals the following rules:\n\n1.  **Trigger**: The transformation is initiated by the presence of a '2' in the grid.\n2.  **Movement**: The '2' moves one step diagonally. The '1's act as barriers, and '0's are empty spaces the '2' can move into.\n3.  **Destination**: The '2' seeks to move to a diagonally adjacent cell that contains a '0'.\n4.  **Priority**: If multiple diagonal cells contain a '0', the '2' moves according to a specific directional priority: Northeast (NE), then Northwest (NW), then Southeast (SE), and finally Southwest (SW).\n5.  **Transformation**: The cell where the '2' moves from becomes a '0', and the destination cell becomes a '2'.\n\nApplying these rules to Input_C:\n\n*   **Input Grid C**:\n    `000000`\n    `011120`\n    `111111`\n*   The '2' is located at row 1, column 4 (using 0-based indexing).\n*   We check its diagonal neighbors for a '0' based on the priority NE > NW > SE > SW.\n    *   **Northeast (NE)**: The cell at (row 0, column 5) contains a '0'.\n*   Since the highest priority move (NE) is available, the '2' will move to this position.\n*   The original position of the '2' at (row 1, column 4) will become a '0'.\n*   The destination at (row 0, column 5) will become a '2'.\n\n*   **Resulting Grid C**:\n    `000002`\n    `011100`\n    `111111`\n\nThis corresponds to the output string '000002,011100,111111'.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
