    "A distinctive architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome, which was present until the late 19th century, were the twin bell towers on the Pantheon. These towers, often disparagingly nicknamed the \"ass's ears,\" were removed by the city administration not in 1950, but in 1883.\n\nThe bell towers were added to the ancient structure in the 17th century under Pope Urban VIII and were a prominent, albeit controversial, feature of the piazza for over two centuries. Their design is frequently, though incorrectly, attributed to the famous Baroque architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Historical records suggest that papal architect Carlo Maderno and his assistant Francesco Borromini were actually responsible for their design.\n\nThe removal of the towers in the late 19th century was part of an effort to restore the Pantheon to a semblance of its original classical appearance. While other modifications and clearings have occurred in the Piazza della Rotonda throughout its long history, the removal of these bell towers represents the most significant alteration to a unique architectural element of the square's main edifice.\n\n<<<the twin bell towers on the Pantheon>>>"
