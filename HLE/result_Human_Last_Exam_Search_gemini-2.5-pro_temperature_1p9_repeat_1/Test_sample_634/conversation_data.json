    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the method of row-reducing a compound matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n-s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 1: Form the compound matrix P.**\nWe stack P1 and P2 to form a single matrix P:\nP =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s    ] (Row 1)\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2   ] (Row 2)\n[ s,        0     ] (Row 3)\n[ -s - 1,   1     ] (Row 4)\n\n**Step 2: Apply elementary row operations to reduce P to a row-echelon form.**\nThe elementary row operations for polynomial matrices include:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nLet's denote the rows as R1, R2, R3, and R4.\n\nSwap R1 and R3 to get a simpler pivot element in the first row:\nP' =\n[ s,        0     ] (R1' = R3)\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2   ] (R2' = R2)\n[ s^2 + s,  -s    ] (R3' = R1)\n[ -s - 1,   1     ] (R4' = R4)\n\nNow, use the new R1' to eliminate the first-column entries in the other rows.\n\n*   Replace R2' with R2' + s * R1':\n    [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s * [s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2]\n*   Replace R3' with R3' - (s + 1) * R1':\n    [s^2 + s, -s] - (s + 1) * [s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s(s + 1), -s] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s] = [0, -s]\n*   Replace R4' with R4' + R1':\n    [-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nP'' =\n[ s,  0   ]\n[ -1, s^2 ]\n[ 0, -s  ]\n[ -1,  1  ]\n\nNow, to simplify further, we can use the last row [-1, 1] as a pivot. Multiply it by -1 (a unimodular operation) to get [1, -1] and swap it to the top.\n\n*   Multiply R4'' by -1: [1, -1]\n*   Swap this new row with R1'':\n\nP''' =\n[ 1,  -1  ]\n[ -1, s^2 ]\n[ s,  0   ]\n[ 0, -s  ]\n\nUse the new first row [1, -1] to eliminate the first-column entries below it.\n\n*   Replace R2''' with R2''' + R1''':\n    [-1, s^2] + [1, -1] = [0, s^2 - 1]\n*   Replace R3''' with R3''' - s * R1''':\n    [s, 0] - s * [1, -1] = [s - s, 0 - s(-1)] = [0, s]\n\nThe matrix transforms to:\nP'''' =\n[ 1, -1     ]\n[ 0, s^2 - 1 ]\n[ 0, s      ]\n[ 0, -s     ]\n\nNow, focus on the submatrix formed by rows 2, 3, and 4.\n\n*   Replace R4'''' with R4'''' + R3'''':\n    [0, -s] + [0, s] =\n\nThe matrix is now:\nP''''' =\n[ 1, -1     ]\n[ 0, s^2 - 1 ]\n[ 0, s      ]\n[ 0, 0      ]\n\nWe now perform a Euclidean-like algorithm on the polynomials in the second column.\n\n*   Replace R2''''' with R2''''' - s * R3''''':\n    [0, s^2 - 1] - s * [0, s] = [0, s^2 - 1 - s^2] = [0, -1]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nP'''''' =\n[ 1, -1 ]\n[ 0, -1 ]\n[ 0,  s ]\n[ 0,  0 ]\n\nNow use the new second row [0, -1] as a pivot.\n\n*   Replace R1'''''' with R1'''''' - R2'''''':\n    [1, -1] - [0, -1] =\n*   Replace R3'''''' with R3'''''' + s * R2'''''':\n    [0, s] + s * [0, -1] = [0, s - s] =\n\nThis gives the matrix:\n[ 1,  0 ]\n[ 0, -1 ]\n[ 0,  0 ]\n[ 0,  0 ]\n\nFinally, multiply the second row by -1:\n[ 1, 0 ]\n[ 0, 1 ]\n[ 0, 0 ]\n[ 0, 0 ]\n\nThe non-zero rows of this reduced matrix form a greatest common right divisor.\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the identity matrix.\n\n<<<[ 1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
