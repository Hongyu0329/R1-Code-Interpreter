    "The chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is the IUPAC name for Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye known for its vibrant fluorescent pink to red color. While Crayola's specific pigment formulations are proprietary, the evidence strongly suggests that this chemical is used in their fluorescent or neon crayons.\n\nCrayola has produced several fluorescent crayons with names that align with the color of Rhodamine B, such as \"Fluorescent Pink,\" \"Hot Magenta,\" \"Shocking Pink,\" and \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\". Rhodamine B is explicitly mentioned as a dye used for red coloring. Given that Rhodamine B is a well-known fluorescent pigment that produces a bright pink or magenta hue, it is highly probable that it is the colorant in one of Crayola's similarly colored crayons.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the Crayola crayon color that most likely contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is a fluorescent pink or magenta, such as **Hot Magenta**, **Shocking Pink**, or **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\n<<<Hot Magenta>>>"
