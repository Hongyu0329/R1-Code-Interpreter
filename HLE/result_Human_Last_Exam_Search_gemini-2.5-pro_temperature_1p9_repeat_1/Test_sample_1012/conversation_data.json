    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer could theoretically break symmetric-key encryption through a brute-force attack using Grover's algorithm. This algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up compared to classical brute-force attacks, which effectively halves the security level of a symmetric key. For example, a 128-bit AES key, when attacked by a quantum computer, would have its security reduced to that of a 64-bit key, which is considered insecure.\n\nTo counteract this quantum threat, the general recommendation is to double the key length. To achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum computer—a commonly accepted baseline for security—a symmetric key of 256 bits is required. With a 256-bit key, Grover's algorithm would require approximately 2^128 operations to break the encryption, which is considered computationally infeasible.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that symmetric-key encryption remains secure in a post-quantum world, a minimum key length of 256 bits is necessary. This is why many organizations and standards bodies, including the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), mandate the use of 256-bit AES keys for protecting sensitive information.\n\n<<<A>>>"
