    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, is a pair of order-preserving maps (morphisms) $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ that satisfy the conditions of being an adjunction between posets. These conditions are equivalent to $f$ being a left adjoint to $g$.\n\nThe number of such adjunctions can be determined by counting either the number of possible left adjoint maps $f$ or the number of possible right adjoint maps $g$. An adjunction is uniquely determined by either of its components.\n\n1.  **Counting Left Adjoints**: A monotone map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). In the context of the poset $[m] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, which is a complete lattice, this condition simplifies. Any monotone map between totally ordered sets preserves non-empty suprema (which are just maxima). The preservation of the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element, requires that $f(0) = 0$. Thus, we need to count the number of monotone maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$.\n\n    A monotone map $f: \\to$ is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$. With the condition $f(0)=0$, we are looking for the number of sequences that satisfy:\n    $0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\n    This is equivalent to choosing 23 values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which contains 38 elements) with replacement, arranged in non-decreasing order. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the stars and bars method. The number of such sequences is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$, where $N$ is the number of items to choose from and $k$ is the number of items to choose.\n\n    Here, $k=23$ and $N=38$. The number of such maps is:\n    $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n2.  **Counting Right Adjoints**: A monotone map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). Similar to the left adjoint case, this simplifies to the condition that $g$ must preserve the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element. Therefore, a monotone map $g: \\to$ is a right adjoint if and only if $g(37) = 23$.\n\n    We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(37)$ such that:\n    $0 \\le g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le g(37) = 23$.\n\n    This is equivalent to choosing 37 values for $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (which contains 24 elements) with replacement.\n    Here, $k=37$ and $N=24$. The number of such maps is:\n    $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\n    Using the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we can see that the two calculations yield the same result:\n    $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is the value of this binomial coefficient.\n\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!} = 323,287,904,785,550,016$.\n\n<<<323287904785550016>>>"
