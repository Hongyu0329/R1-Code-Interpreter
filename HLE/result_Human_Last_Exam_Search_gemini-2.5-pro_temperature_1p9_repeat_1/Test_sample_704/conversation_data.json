    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color produced by combining yellow and blue—which is green—and the color blue itself corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n\nIsaac Newton, in his work \"Opticks\" (1704), created a circular diagram of colors that he analogized to a musical scale. He arranged the colors of the spectrum—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—in a circle and associated them with the seven notes of a musical scale. The combination of yellow and blue pigments results in the color green.\n\nNewton's chosen musical scale was the Dorian mode, which begins on the note D. The colors on his wheel were then correlated with this musical scale. Following the circular arrangement, the colors align with the notes. Green is positioned on the circle leading to blue. The musical note that falls in the range between green and blue is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
