    "The provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an open reading frame (ORF), which is a continuous stretch of codons that is read to produce a protein. An ORF does not contain any \"stop\" codons, which signal the end of translation. To find the correct protein sequence, the nucleotide sequence must be read in the correct \"frame\".\n\nThere are three possible forward reading frames for any DNA sequence. By translating the given sequence in all three frames, the correct one can be identified as the only one that is free of stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting at the 1st nucleotide):** `gga cat tgt tgt tag...` contains a stop codon (`tag`).\n*   **Frame 2 (starting at the 2nd nucleotide):** `g gac att gtt gtt agc...` contains no stop codons.\n*   **Frame 3 (starting at the 3rd nucleotide):** `gg aca ttg ttg tta gcg...` contains a stop codon (`tga`).\n\nTherefore, the correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\n**Reading Frame:** Frame 2\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSELLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSELLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
