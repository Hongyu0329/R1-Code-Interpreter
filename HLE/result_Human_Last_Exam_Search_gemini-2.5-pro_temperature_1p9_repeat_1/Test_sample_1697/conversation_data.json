    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) followed by quenching with an electrophile.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation**\n    *   The starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, possesses two functional groups that can direct the lithiation: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt2) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe2).\n    *   In the presence of a strong base like sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and a chelating agent like TMEDA, a proton on the aromatic ring ortho (adjacent) to a directing metalation group (DMG) is removed.\n    *   When multiple directing groups are present, the most powerful group controls the position of lithiation. The tertiary amide group (-CONR2) is a significantly stronger directing group than a tertiary amine group (-NR2).\n    *   Therefore, the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group directs the sec-BuLi to one of its ortho positions (C2 or C6). The C2 position is also ortho to the dimethylamino group, making the proton at this position the most acidic and the most favorable site for deprotonation due to a cooperative effect.\n    *   The lithium atom replaces the hydrogen at the C2 position, forming the intermediate 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate generated in the first step is a strong nucleophile.\n    *   It reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I). The nucleophilic carbon at C2 attacks the methyl group, and iodide acts as the leaving group.\n    *   This results in the substitution of the lithium atom with a methyl group.\n\nThe final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
