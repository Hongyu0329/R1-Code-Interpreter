    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. To determine the product, the stereochemical requirements of the E2 mechanism must be considered.\n\n1.  **Reagents**: Potassium tert-butoxide (KOC(CH₃)₃) is a strong, sterically bulky base. This, along with the secondary alkyl halide substrate, strongly favors an E2 elimination pathway. The tert-butyl alcohol serves as the solvent.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Substrate**: The designation (1S,2R) tells us the specific stereoisomer. For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, this corresponds to a *cis* configuration, meaning the bromo and methyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n\n3.  **E2 Mechanism Requirement**: The E2 reaction requires a specific geometry where the hydrogen to be removed and the leaving group (bromine) are in an anti-periplanar position. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to the requirement that both the hydrogen and the leaving group must be in axial positions (a trans-diaxial arrangement).\n\n4.  **Chair Conformations**: We must analyze the chair conformations of *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane to find one where the bromine atom is in an axial position.\n    *   **Conformation A**: In this conformation, the bromine atom is axial and the methyl group is equatorial. Let's assume Br is axial-up. As it is a cis-isomer, the methyl group is also up, making it equatorial-up. This conformer is relatively stable.\n    *   **Conformation B (after a ring flip)**: In this conformation, the bromine atom becomes equatorial and the methyl group becomes axial.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Reactive Conformation**: For the E2 reaction to proceed, the bromine leaving group must be in an axial position. Therefore, Conformation A is the reactive conformer.\n\n6.  **Identifying Possible Products**: In Conformation A (with the bromine axial-up), we look for beta-hydrogens (hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbon with the bromine) that are axial-down.\n    *   **Hydrogen on C2**: The carbon bearing the methyl group (C2) has one hydrogen. In this conformation (methyl equatorial), the hydrogen on C2 is axial-down. It is anti-periplanar to the bromine. Its removal would lead to a double bond between C1 and C2, forming **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted alkene, known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **Hydrogen on C6**: The other adjacent carbon (C6) has two hydrogens. One of these is axial-down and is therefore anti-periplanar to the bromine. Its removal would create a double bond between C1 and C6, forming **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\n7.  **Determining the Major Product**: Since both the Zaitsev and Hofmann products can be formed based on stereochemistry, the regioselectivity is determined by the nature of the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, sterically hindered base. Due to its size, it preferentially attacks the less sterically hindered proton. The proton on C6 is more accessible than the proton on C2. Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is the less substituted alkene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
