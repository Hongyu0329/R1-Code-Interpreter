    "<<<Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a justification for this bound:\n1.  The set $U$ is a non-empty open subset of the metric space $X$. By the problem's conditions, every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. Any such neighborhood is an open set in $X$.\n2.  Let $V$ be one of these neighborhoods within $U$ that is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is a separable space (containing the countable dense subset of rational numbers), $V$ is a non-empty open separable subset of $X$.\n3.  A key theorem in topology states that a connected metric space that contains a non-empty open separable subset must itself be separable. Since $X$ is a connected metric space with the non-empty open separable subset $V$, it follows that $X$ is a separable space.\n4.  A separable space is one that contains a countable dense subset.\n5.  For any separable metric space, its cardinality is at most the cardinality of the continuum, $c$. This can be shown because every point in the space is a limit of a sequence of points from the countable dense subset. The set of all sequences from a countable set has cardinality $c$.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of $X$ is at most $c$. This bound is the best possible, as exemplified by $X = \\mathbb{R}$ with $U = \\mathbb{R}$, which satisfies the given conditions and has a cardinality of $c$.>>>"
