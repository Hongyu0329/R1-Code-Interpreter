The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the Berezin integration rules: for a single Grassmann variable θ, the integral of 1 is 0, and the integral of θ is 1. These rules are fundamentally linked to the anti-commuting properties of Grassmann variables, which directly encode the Pauli exclusion principle.
