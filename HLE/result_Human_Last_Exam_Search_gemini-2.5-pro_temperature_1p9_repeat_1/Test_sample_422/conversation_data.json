    "Assuming a universe of epistemic states limited to only \"Knowledge\" (a Justified True Belief) and \"Belief\" (any state short of Knowledge), the JTB definition of Knowledge encounters two significant problems unrelated to Gettier-style cases.\n\n<<<**Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification**\n\nThe \"Justified\" condition of the JTB account creates a logical problem of infinite regress. For a belief to qualify as Knowledge, it must be justified. This justification, however, consists of other beliefs or propositions which themselves must be justified to provide a solid foundation. In a system where every justifying belief must also be an instance of Knowledge (a JTB), this creates an impossible, backward-stepping chain.\n\nConsider a proposition 'P'.\n*   To know 'P', you must have a justified true belief in 'P'.\n*   The justification is another belief, 'Q'.\n*   For 'Q' to serve as a valid justification, you must *know* 'Q'. Under this model, this means 'Q' must also be a justified true belief.\n*   This requires a justification for 'Q', which we can call 'R', and 'R' must also be known, and so on, ad infinitum.\n\nThis forces any attempt at justification into one of three unsatisfying outcomes:\n1.  **Infinite Regress**: The chain of justification goes on forever, meaning no belief is ever fundamentally justified.\n2.  **Circularity**: The chain of justification eventually circles back on itself (e.g., P is justified by Q, which is ultimately justified by P), which is a fallacy.\n3.  **Arbitrary Foundation**: The chain stops at a belief that is not itself justified. In the specified system, this would mean the entire structure of \"Knowledge\" rests upon a foundation of mere \"Belief,\" which cannot logically support it.\n\nThis regress problem questions how any belief can be justified in the first place without relying on an unjustified starting point, an infinite chain, or circular reasoning.\n\n**Problem 2: The Ambiguity of \"Sufficient\" Justification (The Problem of the Criterion)**\n\nThe JTB theory states a belief must be justified, but it fails to define how much or what kind of justification is *sufficient* to convert a true Belief into Knowledge. This inherent vagueness becomes a critical flaw in a binary system of only Belief and Knowledge, as there is no clear, non-arbitrary line to cross between the two states.\n\nThis issue is highlighted by what is known as the \"Problem of the Criterion\". This problem presents a circular dilemma:\n*   To identify instances of Knowledge, we first need a *criterion* for what constitutes sufficient justification.\n*   But to create a reliable criterion for justification, we first need to analyze clear instances of what we already consider to be Knowledge.\n\nThis leaves the JTB account without the tools to specify what makes a justification adequate. For example, if you believe it is raining, is looking out the window enough justification? What if you also check three separate weather forecasts? The JTB model provides no standard for when the tipping point from a true \"Belief\" to \"Knowledge\" is reached. The lack of a clear standard means the distinction is subjective and a contested concept, making it difficult to definitively categorize any given state as either Belief or Knowledge.>>>"
