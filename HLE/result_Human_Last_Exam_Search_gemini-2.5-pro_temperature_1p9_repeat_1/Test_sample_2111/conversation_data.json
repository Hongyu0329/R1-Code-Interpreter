    "In the context of Fernand Braudel's global historical perspective, the conceptual entity that he, quoting Paul Morand, suggests should be inscribed within a sphere is a **civilization**.\n\nFernand Braudel, a leading figure of the Annales School of historiography, was renowned for his analysis of large-scale historical structures over the long term, or *longue dur√©e*. His primary unit of analysis was the \"civilization,\" which he viewed as a vast and enduring entity encompassing broad geographical areas, possessing a unique character, and persisting through various political and economic changes.\n\nFor Braudel, a nation is a significant entity but one that exists within the larger, more encompassing framework of a civilization. The metaphor of being \"inscribed within a sphere\" aptly describes his conception of a civilization as a kind of self-contained world with its own distinctive and deeply rooted structures, mentalities, and networks of exchange. Thus, a nation serves as a specific example of this much broader and more fundamental historical entity.\n\n<<<civilization>>>"
