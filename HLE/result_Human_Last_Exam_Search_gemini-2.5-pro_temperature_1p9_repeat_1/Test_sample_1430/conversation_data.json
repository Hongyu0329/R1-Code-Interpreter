    "Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3 and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as C^(15). To determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted as ρ(X), we first establish the relationship between ρ(X) and the Jacobian variety of C.\n\n### The Rank of the Néron-Severi Group\n\nThe Néron-Severi group, NS(X), consists of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, ρ(X), is also known as the Picard number. For the d-th symmetric power of a curve C, where d is at least the genus g, the Néron-Severi group of Sym^d(C) is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Néron-Severi groups of C and its Jacobian, Jac(C). This gives the formula:\n\nρ(Sym^d(C)) = ρ(C) + ρ(Jac(C))\n\nSince C is a curve, its Néron-Severi rank is 1 (generated by the class of a point). Jac(C) is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension g=3. Thus, the formula for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = C^(15) becomes:\n\nρ(X) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank corresponds to a *generic* genus 3 curve. For a generic curve, its Jacobian Jac(C) has a Néron-Severi group of rank 1. This is because the only algebraic cycles of codimension 1, up to multiples, are given by the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n\nTherefore, the minimum Picard number for Jac(C) is:\nρ_min(Jac(C)) = 1\n\nThis gives the smallest possible rank for NS(X):\nρ_min(X) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nFor a general curve of genus 3, the Néron-Severi rank of its symmetric powers is 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe largest possible rank is achieved when the curve C has special properties, leading to a Jacobian with a larger number of independent algebraic cycles. Such Jacobians are said to have complex multiplication (CM).\n\nThe Picard number of any abelian variety A of dimension g is bounded by the Hodge number h^(1,1)(A). For a g-dimensional abelian variety, the Hodge numbers are given by h^(p,q) = (g choose p) * (g choose q). For our 3-dimensional Jacobian Jac(C):\nh^(1,1)(Jac(C)) = (3 choose 1) * (3 choose 1) = 9.\n\nThis means that ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 9.\n\nA variety is said to be ρ-maximal if its Picard number equals the Hodge number h^(1,1). An abelian variety achieves this maximal Picard number if it is of CM type. The question then is whether a genus 3 curve can have a Jacobian of CM type.\n\nIndeed, such curves exist. A prominent example is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation X⁴ + Y⁴ + Z⁴ = 0. This curve has genus 3, and its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to the cube of a single elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers Z[i]. Such a Jacobian is of CM type and therefore has the maximal Picard number:\n\nρ_max(Jac(C)) = 9.\n\nThere are also simple abelian threefolds (not decomposable into products of lower-dimensional varieties) that are Jacobians of genus 3 curves and achieve this maximal Picard number of 9.\n\nThis leads to the largest possible rank for NS(X):\nρ_max(X) = 1 + 9 = 10.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface depends on the nature of the curve.\n*   **Smallest Rank:** For a generic curve, the rank is **2**.\n*   **Largest Rank:** For a curve with a CM Jacobian, such as the Fermat quartic, the rank is **10**.\n\nSmallest possible rank: <<<2>>>\nLargest possible rank: <<<10>>>"
