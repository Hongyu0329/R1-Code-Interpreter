    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as S(q, ω) or S(k, ω).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, also known as the Van Hove correlation function, G(r, t), describes the correlation between a particle at a certain position and time and another (or the same) particle at a different position and time. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space (r) and time (t) yields the dynamic structure factor. This function is fundamental in nuclear science and engineering, particularly for understanding how neutrons scatter from materials.\n\nThe dynamic structure factor is directly proportional to the double differential scattering cross-section, which is a key quantity in determining how neutrons gain or lose energy and change direction when interacting with a moderating material in a nuclear system. This information is critical for accurately modeling neutron behavior and ensuring criticality safety in nuclear reactors and other applications.\n\nThe dynamic structure factor, S(q, ω), contains information about the collective motions and internal structure of the scattering material. It is a function of the momentum transfer (ħq) and the energy transfer (ħω) during a scattering event. The relationship between the generalized pair correlation function and the dynamic structure factor is a cornerstone of thermal neutron scattering theory.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
