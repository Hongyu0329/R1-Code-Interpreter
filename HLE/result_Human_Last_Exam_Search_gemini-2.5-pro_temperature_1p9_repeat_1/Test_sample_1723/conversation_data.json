    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile many mushrooms have blue coloration on their caps or stems, this coloring does not extend to their spores. Extensive mycological resources and spore print guides list common spore colors as white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, black, and various shades of red and purple. Green is a rare spore color, found in the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, but blue is not a recognized spore color.\n\nFor example, the well-known blue mushroom *Lactarius indigo* has a cream to yellowish spore print. The striking *Entoloma hochstetteri* produces a reddish-pink spore print, and the blue-staining *Panaeolus cyanescens* has a black spore print.\n\nTherefore, the premise of the question is incorrect; a mushroom genus with a distinctly blue spore print does not exist based on current mycological knowledge.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
