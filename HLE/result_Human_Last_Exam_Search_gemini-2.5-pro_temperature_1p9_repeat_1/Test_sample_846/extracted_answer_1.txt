To be functionally accurate, the picnic table shaped like an azobenzene dye molecule must do the following:

**At sunrise**, when exposed to sunlight, the table should change its shape from a relatively flat and elongated form (the *trans*-isomer) to a bent and more compact form (the *cis*-isomer). This transformation is triggered by the UV radiation in sunlight.

**At sunset**, in the absence of sunlight, the table should gradually and slowly return to its original elongated and flatter *trans*-isomer shape. This process is known as thermal relaxation, as the bent *cis*-isomer is less stable and will eventually revert back to the more stable *trans* form in the dark.
