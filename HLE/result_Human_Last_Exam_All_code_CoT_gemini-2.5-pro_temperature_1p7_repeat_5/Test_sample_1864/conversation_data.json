    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to account for three main types of controls: a baseline control, compensation controls, and gating controls.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the fundamental baseline control to measure the autofluorescence of the streptavidin beads themselves. We need one of these.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap (where the signal from one fluorochrome \"leaks\" into another's detector), you need a control sample stained with only one fluorochrome for each color in your panel. Since you have five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For a multi-color sorting experiment, FMO controls are essential for setting accurate gates. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in your panel *except* for one. This helps you see the spread of fluorescence from all other colors into the channel of interest. You will need one FMO control for each of the five fluorochromes.\n\nThe total number of controls will be the sum of these three categories. The following Python code will calculate and explain this sum.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the fluorochromes based on the provided channels\n    fluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_fluorochromes = len(fluorochromes)\n\n    # 1. Unstained control\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    print(f\"1. Unstained Control: You need {unstained_controls} control sample with just the streptavidin beads to measure baseline autofluorescence.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # 2.
