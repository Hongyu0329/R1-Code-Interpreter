    print("The question describes an 'existentially forgeable digital signature scheme' and uses ECDSA as an example.")
    print("This is a key point: Standard, secure ECDSA is designed to be existentially *unforgeable* under chosen message attacks (EUF-CMA).")
    print("An 'existentially forgeable' scheme is, by definition, insecure against this type of forgery. We will analyze each option with this in mind.")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing Option A")
    print("Option A states: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This is false due to ECDSA's malleability. For any given signature (r, s), the signature (r, -s mod n) is also a valid signature for the same message. An adversary can compute this with probability 1 (which is non-negligible), creating a different but valid signature for the same message.")
    print("Conclusion for A: FALSE")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyzing Option B")
    print("Option B states: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This is true. The entire security of ECDSA relies on the difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Recovering the secret key from the public key is equivalent to solving ECDLP, which is believed to be computationally infeasible for a bounded adversary. Therefore, the probability of success is negligible.")
    print("Conclusion for B: TRUE")

    print("\nStep 4: Analyzing Option C")
    print("Option C states: 'For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This is true. A scheme is 'existentially forgeable' if such an attack is possible. Consider the 'textbook' RSA signature scheme (without hashing): sig = m^d mod N. For the message m=1, the signature is always sig=1 (since 1^d = 1). An adversary given m=1 can forge the signature sig'=1 with 100% success (a non-negligible probability).")
    print("Conclusion for C: TRUE")

    print("\nStep 5: Analyzing Option D")
    print("Option D states: 'For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This is false. The statement claims a property for *all* such schemes. Using our 'textbook' RSA counterexample, the message is not hidden. Given a signature `sig` and public key `pk=(e,N)`, anyone can recover the message via `m = sig^e mod N`. This provides a counterexample where the message is recovered with non-negligible probability.")
