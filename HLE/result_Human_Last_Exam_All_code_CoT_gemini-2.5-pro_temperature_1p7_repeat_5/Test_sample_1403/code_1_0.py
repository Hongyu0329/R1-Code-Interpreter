    This program solves the hat puzzle by determining the guaranteed number of correct
    guesses in two different scenarios (N and M) and then calculates their difference.

    The problem assumes a binary choice for hat color (e.g., black or yellow).
    """

    # --- Scenario 1: All 9 individuals guess simultaneously ---
    # In this scenario, we must maximize the guaranteed number of correct guesses, N.
    # The optimal strategy is to split the group and have each subgroup bet on a
    # different global property of the hat distribution.
    num_individuals = 9

    # The group is split into two teams based on the odd number of members.
    group_A_size = math.floor(num_individuals / 2)  # 4 members
    group_B_size = math.ceil(num_individuals / 2)   # 5 members

    # The strategy is for Group A to assume the total count of one color is even,
    # and for Group B to assume it's odd.
    # If the true count is even, Group A (4 people) is correct.
    # If the true count is odd, Group B (5 people) is correct.
    # The guaranteed minimum number of correct guesses is the size of the smaller group.
    N = min(group_A_size, group_B_size)

    # --- Scenario 2: One individual guesses first ---
    # The first person's guess can signal information to the other 8.
    # They signal the parity (even/odd) of the hat colors they see on the other 8.
    # This allows the other 8 individuals to deduce their own hat color with certainty.
    # The number of people guaranteed to be correct, M, is therefore 8.
    M = num_individuals - 1

    # --- Final Calculation ---
    # The problem asks for how many more people will definitely guess correctly.
    difference = M - N
