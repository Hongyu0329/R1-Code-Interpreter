    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to evaluate the quantum mechanical integral, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Request:** The task is to evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ where the orbitals are 1s Slater-Type Orbitals (STOs). The notation with $i$ and $j$ could imply different orbitals, but the phrase \"for a 1s Slater orbital\" (singular) suggests we are dealing with a single type of orbital. The most common and fundamental case is the diagonal element, where $\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi_{1s}$. This integral represents the expectation value of the potential energy from the nuclear attraction for an electron in a 1s orbital.\n\n2.  **Analytical Derivation:**\n    *   A normalized 1s Slater orbital is given by the function: $\\phi_{1s}(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ is the orbital exponent.\n    *   The integral is $\\int \\phi_{1s}^{*}(r) \\frac{1}{r} \\phi_{1s}(r) d^3r$. Since the orbital is real, this becomes $\\int \\left( \\phi_{1s}(r) \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r} d^3r$.\n    *   Substituting the expression for $\\phi_{1s}(r)$ gives: $\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\int e^{-2\\zeta r} \\frac{1}{r} d^3r$.\n    *   We evaluate this in spherical coordinates, where $d^3r = r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\phi$. The integral over the angles $(\\theta, \\phi)$ yields $4\\pi$.\n    *   This simplifies the expression to: $\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} (4\\pi) \\int_0^\\infty r^2 e^{-2\\zeta r} \\frac{1}{r} dr = 4\\zeta^3 \\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr$.\n    *   The remaining integral is a standard form, $\\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-ax} dx = \\frac{n!}{a^{n+1}}$. For our case, $n=1$ and $a=2\\zeta$, so the integral evaluates to $\\frac{1!}{(2\\zeta)^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2}$.\n    *   Putting it all together, the final result is: $4\\zeta^3 \\times \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2} = \\zeta$.\n\n3.  **Python Code Implementation:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to demonstrate this calculation numerically.\n    *   For a concrete example, I will use the Hydrogen atom, where the 1s orbital has an exponent $\\zeta = 1.0$ in atomic units.\n    *   The code will calculate the intermediate components of the final expression and print them out, as requested, showing how they combine to give the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the evaluation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef evaluate_slater_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The orbital exponent zeta.
