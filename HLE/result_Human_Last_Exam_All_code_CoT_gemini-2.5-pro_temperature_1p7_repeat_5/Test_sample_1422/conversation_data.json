    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of vertices (V) in a Feynman diagram with two loops (L=2) for an interacting scalar field theory. The structure of these diagrams is governed by two fundamental topological relations.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Formulas:** We'll use two key formulas:\n    *   The relationship between loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V): `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   The relationship connecting the interaction order (n, for a `φ^n` theory), vertices (V), internal lines (I), and external lines (E): `n * V = 2 * I + E`.\n\n2.  **Derivation:** We are given L=2. We can substitute this into the first formula and solve for I. Then, we substitute that result into the second formula to get a single equation that relates V, n, and E.\n\n3.  **Minimization:** The equation will be of the form `V = f(n, E)`. To find the minimum possible number of vertices, we will look for the smallest positive integer `V` that can be produced by choosing valid integer values for `n` (the interaction order, `n ≥ 3`) and `E` (the number of external lines, `E ≥ 0`).\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be provided to perform this analysis. It will derive the formula, explain the minimization process, and then calculate and print the result for the specific case that yields the minimum number of vertices. The output will show the full equation with all numbers plugged in.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_for_min_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop\n    Feynman diagram in an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop diagram, we use two fundamental relations for Feynman diagrams.\")\n    print(\"Let V = number of vertices, I = internal lines, E = external lines, L = loops, and n = interaction order (e.g., n=4 for φ^4 theory).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe two key formulas are:\")\n    print(\"1.
