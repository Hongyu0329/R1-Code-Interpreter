    "My plan is to first identify the specific theologian and the associated terminology that matches the user's request. The question points to a thinker who dealt with the philosophy of miracles and changes in the natural order in a systematic way, providing a framework that could encompass both unique events like the virgin birth and systemic changes like those potentially following the Fall.\n\nAfter researching major figures in Christian thought, the answer points to Augustine of Hippo and his concept of \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*). I will structure a Python script to present this information clearly. The script will:\n1.  Identify the theologian.\n2.  Define the specialized terminology he developed.\n3.  Explain how this terminology is applied to understand the virgin birth.\n4.  Explain how it can also describe changes in nature related to the Fall.\n\nThe Python code will use `print()` statements to output this explanation for the user.\n\n```python\ndef explain_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains which theologian developed terminology\n    to describe changes in the laws of nature and the concepts involved.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    terminology = \"rationes seminales (Latin for 'seminal reasons' or 'causal reasons')\"\n\n    print(f\"The Christian theologian who first developed this framework was: {theologian}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(f\"Specialized Terminology: {terminology}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Explanation of the Concept:\")\n    print(\"Augustine proposed that at the moment of creation, God embedded 'potentialities' or 'causal principles' (the 'rationes seminales') into matter. The normal, predictable course of nature is simply these principles unfolding over time according to their inherent logic.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis framework allows for seemingly 'unnatural' events without God having to violate or break the very laws He created.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Application to the Virgin Birth:\")\n    print(\"The virgin birth of Jesus is not a violation of biology in Augustine's view. Instead, God activated a latent 'seminal reason' that He had placed within humanity's nature from the very beginning. This potentiality was always present but would only be actualized by a direct act of God at a specific moment in history.\")\n    print(\"\\nApplication to Changes at the Fall:\")\n    print(\"Similarly, this concept can describe alterations in nature after the Fall. The Fall did not necessarily change existing laws, but it could have 'triggered' the activation of previously dormant, negative seminal reasons within creation—principles for decay, disease, pain in childbirth, and agricultural toil—that were then allowed to unfold in the natural world.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
