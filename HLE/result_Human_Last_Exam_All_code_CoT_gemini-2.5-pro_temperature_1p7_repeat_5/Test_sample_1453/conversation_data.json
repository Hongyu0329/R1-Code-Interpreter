    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence, we need to analyze its heptad repeat pattern, specifically the amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions, which dictate the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** A coiled-coil is characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The core hydrophobic positions are `a` and `d`. They are typically spaced with an alternating pattern of 3 and 4 residues.\n2.  **Locate Core Residues:** By examining the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we can identify a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues (Isoleucine 'I' and Leucine 'L') that fit this spacing. The pattern `d-x-x-x-a-x-x-d...` corresponds to residue indices `(i, i+4, i+7, i+11, ...)`. This phasing reveals the following:\n    *   The `d` positions are occupied by Isoleucine (I).\n    *   The `a` positions are occupied by Leucine (L).\n3.  **Analyze Core Packing:** The identity of residues at the `a` and `d` positions is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state.\n    *   **'a' positions:** All are Leucine (L).\n    *   **'d' positions:** All are Isoleucine (I).\n4.  **Determine Oligomeric State:** Foundational research on coiled-coil stability (by Harbury and others) has established rules based on packing efficiency. The combination of Leucine at the 'a' position and the bulky, beta-branched Isoleucine at the 'd' position (`a=L, d=I`) is sterically favored in a parallel four-helix bundle. This specific pattern is a hallmark signature of a **tetramer**.\n\nThe following Python code performs this analysis and prints the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_coiled_coil_oligomerization(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state\n    based on the identity of residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing Protein Sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # The heptad repeat phasing was determined by identifying the alternating\n    # 3- and 4-residue spacing of the core hydrophobic amino acids.\n    # In Python's 0-based indexing:\n    d_indices = [2, 9, 16, 23]  # Positions 3, 10, 17, 24 in the sequence\n    a_indices = [6, 13, 20, 27]  # Positions 7, 14, 21, 28 in the sequence\n\n    d_residues = [sequence[i] for i in d_indices]\n    a_residues = [sequence[i] for i in a_indices]\n\n    print(\"1.
