    "In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the 25 Prophets mentioned in the Quran are enumerated over a specific range of verses (bayt).\n\nMy plan to answer this is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the starting bayt where the list of Prophets' names begins. Based on the poem's text, the list starts after a preparatory verse, specifically at bayt 36.\n2.  Next, I will identify the final bayt that contains the last of the names in the list. The list concludes with Prophet Muhammad ï·º in bayt 39.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores these two numbers (36 and 39) and prints a clear sentence stating the range. This script will explicitly output both the start and end numbers as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt) in the poem\n# 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n\n# The list of the twenty-five Prophets begins at this verse number.\nstart_bayt = 36\n\n# The list of the twenty-five Prophets concludes at this verse number.\nend_bayt = 39\n\n# The print statement below will output a sentence containing both numbers,\n# clearly stating the range.\nprint(f\"The names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt} in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'.\")\n```\n<<<The names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from bayt 36 to bayt 39 in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'.>>>"
