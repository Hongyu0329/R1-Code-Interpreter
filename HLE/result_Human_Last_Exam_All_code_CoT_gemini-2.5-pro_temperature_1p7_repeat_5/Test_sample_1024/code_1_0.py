# Step 1: Solve for Part A
# The lines allude to "The Adventure of the Priory School," where faked
# cow tracks are used to mislead Holmes. This corresponds to option 6.
answer_A = 6

# Step 2: Solve for Part C
# Nabokov's most intense experience with intricate back-referencing was his
# massive annotated translation of Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin." This is option 7.
answer_C = 7

# Step 3: Use the mathematical constraint to find Part B
# The sum A + B + C must be a multiple of 8.
# 6 + B + 7 = 13 + B. The next multiple of 8 is 16.
# 13 + B = 16, which means B must be 3.
answer_B = 3

# Step 4: Verify Part B
# The corresponding theme (option 3) is "education vs mis-education." This fits
# the "Priory School" allusion and the academic setting of "Pale Fire."

# Step 5: Format and print the final answers as requested.
# The final answer is the three numbers separated by spaces.
final_answer_string = f"{answer_A} {answer_B} {answer_C}"
