        'A': "Incorrect. Tandem repeats are regions of repetitive DNA. They do not provide a mechanism to protect essential gene function from mutation.",
        'B': "Incorrect. Chromosomal inversions are known to suppress recombination, which would worsen, not compensate for, genetic deterioration in affected regions.",
        'C': "Incorrect. Transposable elements are often considered parasitic DNA and their accumulation is typically a sign of ineffective selection, not a protective mechanism.",
        'D': "Correct. Multigene families are sets of similar genes created by duplication. This creates functional redundancy. If one gene copy accumulates a deleterious mutation, other copies in the family can still perform the vital function, thus providing a direct buffer against genetic deterioration.",
        'E': "Plausible, but less precise. Polyploidy (having extra sets of chromosomes) also creates redundancy. However, the underlying protective feature at the gene level is the existence of multiple gene copies, which is best described as multigene families. 'Multigene families' is the more fundamental architectural answer."
