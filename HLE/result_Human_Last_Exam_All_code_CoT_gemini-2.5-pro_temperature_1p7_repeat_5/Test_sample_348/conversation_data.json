    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium point, which is where the supply and demand curves intersect. Then, we calculate the Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS). The total welfare is the sum of CS and PS.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** The equilibrium point `(Q_e, P_e)` is found by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\n    `ln(Q_S^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n    Since `Q_S = Q_D = Q_e` at equilibrium, we will solve the equation `ln(Q_e^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_e))` for the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`. This requires a numerical solver. Once `Q_e` is found, we can calculate the equilibrium price `P_e` by substituting `Q_e` into either function.\n\n2.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** CS is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price `P_e`, integrated from `Q=0` to `Q=Q_e`.\n    `CS = ∫[0 to Q_e] D(Q)dQ - (P_e * Q_e)`\n\n3.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** PS is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price `P_e`. The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, so the integration starts from `Q_min = 2^(1/3)`.\n    `PS = (P_e * Q_e) - ∫[Q_min to Q_e] S(Q)dQ`\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus.\n    `Total Welfare = CS + PS`\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using `scipy` for numerical calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define supply and demand functions\n    def demand(q):\n        \"\"\"Demand function: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\"\"\"\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n    def supply(q):\n        \"\"\"Supply function: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n        # Ensure the argument of log is positive to avoid domain errors\n        # np.log will raise a warning and return NaN for non-positive inputs\n        with np.errstate(divide='ignore', invalid='ignore'):\n            return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\n    # Define the equation to find the root for equilibrium\n    def equilibrium_equation(q):\n        \"\"\"Returns the difference between supply and demand prices.\"\"\"\n        # Handle cases outside the supply function's domain\n        if q <= 2**(1/3):\n            # Return a large value to guide the solver away from this region\n            return -1e9\n        return supply(q) - demand(q)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Find Market Equilibrium ---\n    # The supply curve starts at Q > 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.
