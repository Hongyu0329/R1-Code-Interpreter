    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Attacks**: The board is a 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. This means a queen's attack (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) also wraps around. For two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on an `N x N` board, they attack each other if:\n    *   They are in the same row (`r1 == r2`).\n    *   They are in the same column (`c1 == c2`).\n    *   They are on the same diagonal. This happens when the toroidal distance between their rows equals the toroidal distance between their columns. The toroidal distance between two points `x1` and `x2` is `min(|x1 - x2|, N - |x1 - x2|)`.\n\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm**: This is a counting problem on a small board. A backtracking search is a perfect and reliable method. We will try to place 4 queens one by one, and if a placement leads to a conflict, we backtrack and try another position.\n\n3.  **Implement Backtracking**:\n    *   We will write a recursive function, let's call it `find_placements`.\n    *   This function will try to place queens on the board sequentially. To avoid counting the same arrangement multiple times (e.g., placing a queen at A then B vs. B then A), we will process the board's 25 squares in a fixed order (from square 0 to 24). If we place a queen at square `i`, the next queen will only be considered for squares `j > i`.\n    *   The recursion's base case is when we have successfully placed all 4 queens. At this point, we've found one valid way, so we increment our solution counter.\n    *   In the recursive step, we loop through the available squares. For each square, we check if placing a queen there is \"safe\" (doesn't attack any previously placed queens) using the toroidal attack rules.\n    *   If it's safe, we place the queen and make a recursive call to place the next one. After the call returns, we remove the queen (this is the \"backtracking\" step) to explore other possibilities.\n\n4.  **Final Output**: After the search is complete, the value of our counter will be the total number of ways. The program will print this final count.\n\nThis method will systematically check all possible combinations and count every valid one.\n\n```python\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place K non-attacking queens on an N x N toroidal board.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5\n    K = 4\n    \n    # Using a list to hold the count so it can be modified within the nested function.\n    solution_count = [0]\n\n    def is_safe(r_new, c_new, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a queen at (r_new, c_new) is safe with respect to existing placements.\n        \"\"\"\n        for r_old, c_old in placements:\n            # Check for row or column attack\n            if r_new == r_old or c_new == c_old:\n                return False\n\n            # Check for toroidal diagonal attack\n            d_row = abs(r_new - r_old)\n            d_col = abs(c_new - c_old)\n            \n            toroidal_d_row = min(d_row, N - d_row)\n            toroidal_d_col = min(d_col, N - d_col)\n\n            if toroidal_d_row == toroidal_d_col:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def find_placements(start_index, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        A recursive backtracking function to find all valid placements.\n        - start_index: The linear index on the board (0-24) from which to start searching.\n        - placements: A list of (row, col) tuples for queens already on the board.\n        \"\"\"\n        if len(placements) == K:\n            solution_count[0] += 1\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through the remaining squares on the board\n        for i in range(start_index, N * N):\n            r = i // N\n            c = i % N\n\n            if is_safe(r, c, placements):\n                # If safe, place the queen\n                placements.append((r, c))\n                # Recurse to find placements for the next queen\n                find_placements(i + 1, placements)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities\n                placements.pop()\n\n    # Start the search from the first square (index 0) with an empty set of placements.\n    find_placements(0, [])\n    \n    final_count = solution_count[0]\n    print(f\"On a {N}x{N} toroidal chessboard, there are {final_count} ways to place {K} non-attacking queens.\")\n\nsolve_toroidal_queens()\n<<<200>>>\n```"
