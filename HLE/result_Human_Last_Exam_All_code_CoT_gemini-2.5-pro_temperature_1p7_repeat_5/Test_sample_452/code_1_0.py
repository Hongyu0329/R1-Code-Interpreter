# The problem is to find the constant 'b' in the asymptotic formula for the expected
# cover time of a uniform random tree, which is given by C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2).
#
# This is a classic result from probability theory, largely established by David Aldous.
# The constant 'b' is derived from the analysis of Brownian motion on the Continuum Random Tree,
# which serves as the scaling limit for large uniform random trees.
#
# The exact value of the constant is given by the formula: b = sqrt(π / 2).
#
# This script calculates the numerical value of this constant.

# The equation is b = sqrt(pi / 2).
# The numbers in the equation are pi and 2.
pi_value = math.pi
denominator_value = 2

# Calculate the value of the constant b
b_value = math.sqrt(pi_value / denominator_value)
