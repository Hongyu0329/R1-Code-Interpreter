    "My plan is to identify the underlying pattern in the sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`.\n\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** I'll break down the sequence into parts to find a recognizable pattern. The sequence appears to have two distinct sections: `3 2 1 2 3` and `3 3 3 2 2`.\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis:** The second part, `3 3 3 2 2`, suggests a pattern of descending numbers in blocks. A block of `3,3,3` is followed by the beginning of a block of `2`s. The most logical pattern is that these blocks are of a consistent size, likely three elements.\n3.  **Test the hypothesis:** The pattern is likely `..., (4,4,4), (3,3,3), (2,2,2), (1,1,1), ...`. The given sequence contains a full `(3,3,3)` block and an incomplete `(2,2)` block.\n4.  **Predict the next elements:** To complete the `(2,2,2)` block, the next element must be `2`. After the block of twos is complete, the next block in the descending pattern will be `(1,1,1)`.\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that implements this logic to determine the next four elements and print them clearly, fulfilling the request.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the next 4 elements in the sequence: 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2.\n\n# 1. Analyze the sequence for a pattern.\n# The sequence can be seen as having an introductory part followed by a core pattern.\n# Introductory part: 3, 2, 1, 2, 3\n# Core pattern part: 3, 3, 3, 2, 2...\n# 2. Identify the core pattern.\n# The pattern appears to be blocks of three identical numbers, in descending order.\n# For example: ..., (4,4,4), (3,3,3), (2,2,2), (1,1,1), ...\n# The provided sequence shows a full block of threes [3, 3, 3] and an incomplete block of twos [2, 2].\n# 3. Predict the next elements based on the pattern.\n# To complete the current block of twos, the next element must be 2.\n# After the block of twos is complete, the next block in the pattern would be composed of ones.\n# Thus, the three elements after that would be 1, 1, 1.\n\n# The first of the next four elements completes the block of twos.\nnext_element_1 = 2\n\n# The next three elements form the block of ones.\nnext_element_2 = 1\nnext_element_3 = 1\nnext_element_4 = 1\n\nprint(f\"The sequence is 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2.\")\nprint(f\"The pattern is interpreted as groups of three, in decreasing order (e.g. 3,3,3 then 2,2,2 etc).\")\nprint(f\"The sequence is currently in a group of twos: '2, 2'. The next number must complete this group.\")\n# As requested by the prompt to output each number in the \"final equation\", we present the next four elements.\nprint(f\"The next 4 elements that complete the sequence are: {next_element_1}, {next_element_2}, {next_element_3}, {next_element_4}\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Complete the next 4 elements of this sequence:\n3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 2 1 1 1\nB. 2 4 4 4\nC. 2 3 1 2\nD. 2 1 2 3\nE. 2 3 5 5\nF. 2 3 2 1\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
