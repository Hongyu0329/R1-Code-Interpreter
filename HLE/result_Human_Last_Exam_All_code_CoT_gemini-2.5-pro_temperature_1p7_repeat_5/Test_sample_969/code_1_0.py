# The user wants to find the next 4 elements in the sequence: 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2.

# 1. Analyze the sequence for a pattern.
# The sequence can be seen as having an introductory part followed by a core pattern.
# Introductory part: 3, 2, 1, 2, 3
# Core pattern part: 3, 3, 3, 2, 2...
# 2. Identify the core pattern.
# The pattern appears to be blocks of three identical numbers, in descending order.
# For example: ..., (4,4,4), (3,3,3), (2,2,2), (1,1,1), ...
# The provided sequence shows a full block of threes [3, 3, 3] and an incomplete block of twos [2, 2].
# 3. Predict the next elements based on the pattern.
# To complete the current block of twos, the next element must be 2.
# After the block of twos is complete, the next block in the pattern would be composed of ones.
# Thus, the three elements after that would be 1, 1, 1.

# The first of the next four elements completes the block of twos.
next_element_1 = 2

# The next three elements form the block of ones.
next_element_2 = 1
next_element_3 = 1
next_element_4 = 1

print(f"The sequence is 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2.")
print(f"The pattern is interpreted as groups of three, in decreasing order (e.g. 3,3,3 then 2,2,2 etc).")
print(f"The sequence is currently in a group of twos: '2, 2'. The next number must complete this group.")
# As requested by the prompt to output each number in the "final equation", we present the next four elements.
print(f"The next 4 elements that complete the sequence are: {next_element_1}, {next_element_2}, {next_element_3}, {next_element_4}")
