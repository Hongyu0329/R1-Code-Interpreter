    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_{i}(+\\infty)$, we need to solve the given system of differential equations in the limit as $t \\to +\\infty$. In this limit, the system is in equilibrium, which means the probabilities are no longer changing with time, so all derivatives $P_{i}'(t)$ are equal to zero. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_{i}(+\\infty)$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Steady-State Equations:**\n    By setting $P_{i}'(t) = 0$, the system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n2.  **Correct the System Equations:**\n    The provided equation for $P_1'(t)$ is $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$ is unusual for a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, which models transitions between states. Typically, a flow from state 0 to state 1 would contribute positively to the rate of change of $P_1$. Furthermore, with the given sign, the sum of all probabilities is not conserved (i.e., $\\frac{d}{dt}\\sum P_i(t) \\neq 0$), which contradicts the normalization condition $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$.\n    We will assume this is a typo and that the term should be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$, which is standard and ensures probability conservation.\n    The corrected equation for $P_1'(t)$ is: $P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$.\n    With this correction, summing all four derivative equations gives 0, meaning $\\sum P_i(t)$ is constant.\n\n3.  **Set up the Linear System for Steady State:**\n    Using the corrected system and setting the derivatives to zero, we get:\n    $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$ (from $P_2'(t)=0$)\n    $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$ (from $P_3'(t)=0$)\n    And the normalization condition:\n    $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n    These four equations form a complete system for the four unknown probabilities $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n\n4.  **Solve the System using Python:**\n    We can represent this linear system in matrix form as $A\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$ and solve it for the vector of probabilities $\\mathbf{p}$. The Python `numpy` library is ideal for this kind of numerical problem. We will construct the matrix `A` and vector `b` and use `numpy.linalg.solve` to find the probabilities. Finally, we compute the desired sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given lambda values\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), the derivatives P_i'(t) are 0.\n# Let p_i = P_i(+inf). This gives us a system of linear equations.\n# We will use the following equations to build the system Ap = b:\n# 1) From P_0'(t)=0: -lambda_01*p0 + lambda_10*p1 = 0\n# 2) From P_2'(t)=0: lambda_12*p1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*p2 = 0\n# 3) From P_3'(t)=0: lambda_23*p2 - lambda_31*p3 = 0\n# 4) Normalization condition: p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n# Note: The equation for P_1'(t) becomes redundant with the corrected system.\n\n# Coefficient matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\n# Constant vector b\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations for p = [p0, p1, p2, p3]\ntry:\n    p = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    p0 = p[0]\n    p1 = p[1]\n    result = p0 + p1\n\n    # Print the values for the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"P_0(inf) = {p0}\")\n    print(f\"P_1(inf) = {p1}\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: P_0(inf) + P_1(inf) = {p0} + {p1}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations has no unique solution.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339464>>>"
