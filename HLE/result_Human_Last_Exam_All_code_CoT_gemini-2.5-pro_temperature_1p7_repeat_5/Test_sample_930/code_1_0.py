# The task is to identify the indices of organisms that have a mutualistic relationship with Asclepias fascicularis.
# A mutualistic relationship is one where both species benefit. In the context of a plant, this typically involves pollination or defense.

# We will evaluate each organism based on its interaction with the plant.
# Adult insects that act as pollinators (receiving nectar/pollen while helping the plant reproduce) are mutualists.
# Adult insects that act as defenders (receiving nectar while protecting the plant from herbivores) are also mutualists.
# Larvae that are herbivores (eating the plant) are not mutualists.
# Larvae that do not interact with the plant are not mutualists.

# Based on this analysis:
# 1. Danaus plexipus (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
# 2. Megachile frigidus (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
# 3. Formica rufa (Adult): Defender/Nectar feeder -> Mutualist.
# 4. Sphex ichneumoneus (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
# 5. Pepsis thisbe (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
# 6. Megachile ericetorum (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
# 7. Danaus plexipus (Larva): Herbivore -> Not a mutualist.
# 8-12. Other Larvae: No direct interaction -> Not mutualists.

# Therefore, the list of indices corresponding to mutualists is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
mutualist_indices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# The final answer should be a comma-separated string of these indices.
result = ",".join(map(str, mutualist_indices))
