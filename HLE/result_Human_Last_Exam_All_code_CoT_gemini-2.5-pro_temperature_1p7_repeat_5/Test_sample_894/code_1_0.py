def find_nullified_propositions():
    """
    Identifies and prints the letters of the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that would be nullified if a competing proposition passes with more votes.

    This is based on information from the official San Francisco Department of Elections
    voter guide for the November 5, 2024 election.

    The conflicting pairs are:
    1. Proposition B and Proposition E: Both address police department policies and funding.
       If both pass, the one with more 'yes' votes is enacted, and the other is nullified.
    2. Proposition C and Proposition J: Both address changes to real estate-related taxes.
       If both pass, the one with more 'yes' votes is enacted, and the other is nullified.

    Therefore, the propositions that could be nullified are B, E, C, and J.
