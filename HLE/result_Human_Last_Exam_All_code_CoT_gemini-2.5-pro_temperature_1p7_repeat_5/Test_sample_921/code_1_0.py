# The user-provided C program is incorrect due to a flawed implementation
# of the tangent approximation and the high risk of integer overflow.
# This Python script provides an optimal and accurate solution.

# --- Inputs from the problem description ---
angle_deg = 40
distance_m = 100

# --- Accurate Calculation ---

# 1. Convert the angle from degrees to radians using the accurate library function.
angle_rad = math.radians(angle_deg)

# 2. Calculate the tangent of the angle in radians.
tan_value = math.tan(angle_rad)

# 3. Calculate the height. Formula: height = distance * tan(angle)
height_accurate = distance_m * tan_value

# --- Memory Usage Calculation ---

# We use sys.getsizeof() to determine the memory footprint of each Python object.
mem_angle = sys.getsizeof(angle_deg)
mem_distance = sys.getsizeof(distance_m)
mem_rad = sys.getsizeof(angle_rad)
mem_height = sys.getsizeof(height_accurate)
total_memory = mem_angle + mem_distance + mem_rad + mem_height

# --- Final Output ---

# 'o' is the accurately calculated height, rounded to the nearest integer.
o = int(round(height_accurate))

# 'z' is the total memory used by the primary variables in bytes.
z = total_memory

# As requested, output each number in the final equation.
print("Corrected calculation of the palace height:")
