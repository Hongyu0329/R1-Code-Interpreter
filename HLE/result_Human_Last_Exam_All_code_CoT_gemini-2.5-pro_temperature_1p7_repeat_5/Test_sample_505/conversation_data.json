    "In the theory of topological quantum error correction, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded on a surface is determined by its topology. For a planar surface code patch, which is topologically equivalent to a disk, the number of logical qubits it can store is equal to the number of \"holes\" or internal boundaries it contains.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Establish the number of logical qubits for a single patch of surface code with two holes. According to the principle mentioned above, one patch with `h` holes can encode `k = h` logical qubits.\n2.  Calculate the total number of logical qubits for the entire system, which consists of two such independent patches. Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n3.  Create a Python script to represent this calculation and print the final result as an equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubit_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits in a system of\n    two surface code patches, each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of independent surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes in each patch\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # For a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits (k) that can be\n    # encoded in a single patch is equal to the number of holes (h).\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum from all independent patches.\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\n    print(\"To find the total number of logical qubits, we first find the number per patch and then sum them.\")\n    print(f\"Number of logical qubits per patch = Number of holes = {logical_qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"Total logical qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\")\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = {logical_qubits_per_patch} + {logical_qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\nsolve_qubit_count()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
