    Explains the fundamental limitation of bulk melting experiments for nucleic acids.

    explanation = """
The question asks for a fundamental limitation of bulk melting experiments used to determine nucleic acid thermodynamics, even under ideal conditions. The key is the nature of a "bulk" measurement.

1.  **Analyze Choices A and B:** Assuming that the heat capacity change (ΔCp) is zero (A) and that thermodynamic parameters are temperature-independent (B) are simplifications of the *analytical model* used to interpret the data. They are not inherent limitations of the *experimental measurement itself*. A precise bulk experiment can indeed measure a non-zero ΔCp.

2.  **Analyze Choices D and E:** Stating that temperature cannot be controlled (E) is incorrect; precise temperature control is the basis of these experiments. Stating that temperature oscillations are too large (D) is a technical, not a fundamental, limitation. Modern instruments have excellent temperature stability.

3.  **Analyze Choice C:** A bulk experiment measures the average property of a huge ensemble of molecules. This averaging process inherently conceals any variations between individual molecules or fluctuations of a single molecule over time. This includes "heterogeneity" such as the presence of different molecular structures, or more critically, the existence of partially melted intermediate states along the melting pathway. A bulk experiment yields a single smooth curve that averages over all these states, making it impossible to distinguish a simple two-state process from a more complex multi-state one. This is a fundamental limitation that single-molecule experiments are designed to address.

Therefore, the impossibility of capturing heterogeneity is the correct answer.
