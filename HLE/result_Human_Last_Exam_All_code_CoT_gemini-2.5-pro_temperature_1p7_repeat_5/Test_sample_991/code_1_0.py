# This script solves a Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into its visual components.
# It then forms an equation using the stroke count of each component.

print("The riddle is: A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.")
print("\nLet's analyze the clues to build the character:")

# 1. "A wooden stick, hanging a square box"
# This describes the top section of the character '高' (gāo).
# This section is made of the '亠' (tóu) and '口' (kǒu) radicals.
part1_strokes = 2
part2_strokes = 3
print(f"\nClue 1: 'A wooden stick, hanging a square box'")
print(f"This refers to the top portion of the character, which is '亠' over a '口'.")
print(f"   - The stroke count for the 'stick' part (亠) is: {part1_strokes}")
print(f"   - The stroke count for the 'box' part (口) is: {part2_strokes}")

# 2. "a ladder placed in the center"
# This poetically describes the base of '高', which is the '冋' (jiōng) radical.
# It resembles a tower or a structure you would climb, and the character's meaning of "high" supports this.
part3_strokes = 5
print(f"\nClue 2: 'a ladder placed in the center'")
print(f"This refers to the base of the character, '冋', which gives it height and resembles a structure to be climbed.")
print(f"   - The stroke count for this 'ladder' part (冋) is: {part3_strokes}")

# 3. The Final Character and Equation
# The parts combine to form the character '高', and the equation is the sum of the strokes.
total_strokes = part1_strokes + part2_strokes + part3_strokes
print("\nWhen we combine these parts, we get the character '高' (gāo), which means 'high' or 'tall'.")
print("\nTo represent this as an equation using the stroke counts of each component:")
print(f"The final equation is: {part1_strokes} + {part2_strokes} + {part3_strokes} = {total_strokes}")
print(f"\nTherefore, the character described by the riddle is 高.")
