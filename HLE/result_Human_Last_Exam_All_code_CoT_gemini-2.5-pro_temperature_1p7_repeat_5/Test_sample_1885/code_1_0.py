    print("The relation omega_2 -> (omega_1)^2_{omega_1} is a theorem of ZFC.")

    print("  - A single finite set R, a subset of omega_1.")
    print("such that for every alpha < beta in X, E_{alpha,beta} = R.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the functions on this uncountable set X.")
    print("Let's pick a coordinate 'gamma_0' that is NOT in the finite set R. (This is possible since omega_1 is infinite).")

    print("Let's take any omega_1-sized sample from X, call it X' = {beta_nu | nu < omega_1}, ordered by nu.")

    print("The supremum (least upper bound) of such a sequence must be omega_1 itself.")
    print("Therefore, sup({f_beta(gamma_0) | beta in X}) = omega_1.")

    print("\nStep 5: Final Conclusion.")
    print("We have found an uncountable set X for which there is a coordinate gamma_0 where the functions are unbounded.")
    print("A bounding function 'g' would require g(gamma_0) >= sup({f_beta(gamma_0) | beta in X}).")
    print("This would mean g(gamma_0) >= omega_1.")
    print("However, g must map to omega_1, so its values must be *in* omega_1. This is a contradiction.")
    print("Since we demonstrated a scenario where such a g cannot exist, the answer to the question is NO.")
