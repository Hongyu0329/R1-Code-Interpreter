    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), we need to examine the standard industrial and laboratory methods for its production.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Identify the primary synthesis reaction for XeF₄.\n2.  Research the required conditions for this reaction, specifically the temperature needed for an efficient yield.\n3.  The main method for producing XeF₄ is the direct reaction of xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F₂).\n4.  The chemical equation for this synthesis is: `Xe + 2 F₂ → XeF₄`.\n5.  This reaction's outcome is sensitive to temperature. While the reaction can occur at various temperatures, efficiency (a combination of reaction rate and product yield) is optimal within a specific range.\n6.  According to chemical literature, heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine to **400 °C** is the standard condition for producing XeF₄ efficiently.\n7.  At significantly lower temperatures, the reaction rate is too slow to be practical. At higher temperatures (e.g., above 600 °C) and with excess fluorine, the reaction tends to produce Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) instead.\n8.  Therefore, 400 °C is the correct temperature from the given choices. I will write a Python script to print this explanation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) and identifies the optimal temperature.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The primary method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is through the direct reaction of its constituent elements, Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\")\n    # The equation Xe + 2 F₂ -> XeF₄ has stoichiometric coefficients 1, 2, and 1.\n    print(\"1 Xe + 2 F₂ -> 1 XeF₄\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFor this reaction to be efficient in producing Xenon tetrafluoride, specific conditions are required.\")\n    print(\"While the reaction can proceed at various temperatures, the standard and most efficient temperature is 400 °C.\")\n    print(\"\\n- At temperatures much lower than 400 °C, the reaction is too slow for efficient production.\")\n    print(\"- At higher temperatures (e.g., 600 °C), the reaction favors the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\")\n\n    optimal_temp = 400  # in Celsius\n    \n    print(f\"\\nBased on established chemical synthesis methods, the coldest temperature listed at which XeF₄ can be produced efficiently is {optimal_temp} °C.\")\n\nfind_synthesis_temperature()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
