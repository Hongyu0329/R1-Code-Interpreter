    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Tool**: The problem asks for the number of nonzero coefficients of a specific order in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. This number is equivalent to the dimension of the homogeneous subspace of that order in a free Lie algebra. This dimension can be calculated using Witt's Formula.\n\n2.  **Witt's Formula**: The formula is given by:\n    `L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the order of the coefficients, which is `10` in this case.\n    *   `k` is the number of generators of the algebra (here, `X` and `Y`, so `k=2`).\n    *   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n    *   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n3.  **Execution Steps**: The Python code will perform the following steps:\n    *   Define `n=10` and `k=2`.\n    *   Find all positive divisors `d` of `10` (which are 1, 2, 5, 10).\n    *   For each divisor `d`, calculate the value of the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n    *   Calculate each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)` in the summation.\n    *   Sum up all the terms.\n    *   Divide the final sum by `n=10` to get the result.\n    *   Print out each step of the calculation to show how the final answer is derived, including the full equation with all numbers.\n\nThis process will give us the precise number of nonzero coefficients.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) -> {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    mu(n) = 1 if n is a square-free with an even number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = -1 if n is a square-free with an odd number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0 # Has a squared prime factor\n            \n    return (-1)**len(factors) # (-1)^k for k distinct prime factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_nonzero_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the\n    BCH expansion using Witt's formula and prints the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
