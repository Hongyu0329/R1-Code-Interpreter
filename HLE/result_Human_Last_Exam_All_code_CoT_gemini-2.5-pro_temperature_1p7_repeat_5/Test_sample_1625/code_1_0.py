    1. A 'toroidal system' is a geometric shape like a donut. In physics, this often refers to devices like tokamaks for magnetic confinement fusion.

    2. 'Poloidal dependence' refers to how a physical quantity changes as you move along the poloidal angle, which is the 'short way' around the donut. This angle is periodic, meaning it repeats every 360 degrees (2*pi radians).

    3. A 'spectral series expansion' is a method to represent a function as a sum of simpler, standard functions (called basis functions).

    4. The key is to choose the basis functions that are best suited for the geometry and properties of the variable. For a periodic variable, like the poloidal angle, the most natural and mathematically fundamental choice for a spectral expansion is the Fourier series, which is built from sine and cosine functions that are themselves periodic.

    5. Therefore, the Fourier series is the standard technique adapted for representing poloidal dependence in toroidal systems.
