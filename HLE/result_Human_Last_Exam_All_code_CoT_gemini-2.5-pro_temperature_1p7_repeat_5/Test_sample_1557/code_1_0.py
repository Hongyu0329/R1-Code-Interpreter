    This function identifies the correct statements regarding the influence of Wellington's military
    innovations in India on later British imperial practices.

    After analyzing each statement based on historical records:
    - Statement 1 is correct: The mobile commissariat system from India was indeed adapted for the Peninsular Campaign with great success.
    - Statement 6 is correct: The practice of integrating local auxiliary forces, tested in India, became a standard for British colonial expansion.
    - Statement 8 is correct: The tactical use of flying columns was developed in India and successfully adapted for other campaigns, including the Peninsular War and in Burma.

    The other statements contain factual inaccuracies or misrepresentations:
    - 2: False, his intelligence system was famously successful in the Peninsula.
    - 3: False, army-wide reform was not that direct or immediate.
    - 4: False, Sandhurst was founded much earlier.
    - 5, 7, 10: False, all wrongly claim his Indian experience had no impact on later campaigns.
    - 9: False, the 1813 EIC reforms had broader political and economic origins.

    The correct options are therefore 1, 6, and 8.
