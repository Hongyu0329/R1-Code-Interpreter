    Calculates the number of n-simplices for the given problem.

    The number of n-simplices in the nerve of the overcategory N_â€¢(Z_N)_{k/}
    is the number of non-decreasing sequences (c_0, c_1, ..., c_n)
    such that k <= c_0 <= c_1 <= ... <= c_n <= N.

    This is a combination with repetition problem. The number of such sequences
    is given by C(m + r - 1, r), where m is the number of items to choose from
    and r is the number of choices.
    Here, m = (N - k + 1) is the number of objects in the overcategory,
    and r = n + 1 is the length of the simplex sequence.
    The formula is C((N - k + 1) + (n + 1) - 1, n + 1) = C(N - k + n + 1, n + 1).
