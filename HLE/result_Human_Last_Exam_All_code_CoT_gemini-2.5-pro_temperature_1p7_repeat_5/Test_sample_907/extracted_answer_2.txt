The final equations for the absorption cross-section are provided by the Python script. For non-interacting molecules (Case a), the absorption spectrum is a sum of distinct Gaussian peaks centered at the molecular electronic transition frequencies. When near-neighbor interactions are included (Case b), the molecular states form delocalized exciton bands. This results in a broad absorption spectrum whose shape is determined by the joint density of states of the bands, with the allowed transitions being subject to the k-vector selection rule.
