    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the main, stable allotropes of phosphorus.** These are the distinct structural forms of the element that are commonly recognized.\n2.  **Determine the characteristic color of each allotrope.**\n3.  **Count the number of unique colors.**\n4.  **Create a Python script** that lists these colors and prints the final count, representing the process as a simple summation to fulfill the request.\n\nThe primary, well-established allotropes are White Phosphorus, Red Phosphorus, Violet Phosphorus, and Black Phosphorus. Each of these has a distinct color.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of the main allotropes of phosphorus\n    and counts the number of distinct colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the main allotropes and their corresponding colors.\n    # We focus on the four major, well-established allotropes.\n    # - White Phosphorus is a molecular solid (P4), appearing white or colorless when pure.\n    # - Red Phosphorus is a polymeric form, appearing red.\n    # - Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus) is another polymeric form, appearing violet.\n    # - Black Phosphorus is the most stable form, layered like graphite, appearing black.\n    allotropes_to_colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"white\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"black\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Get the list of unique colors.\n    unique_colors = sorted(list(set(allotropes_to_colors.values())))\n    \n    # Step 4: Display the findings and the final count.\n    # We will list each color found and then sum them for the total.\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in the main pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color in unique_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color.capitalize()}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of colors, we sum the count for each unique color:\")\n    \n    # Building the \"equation\" as requested\n    equation_parts = [f\"1 ({color})\" for color in unique_colors]\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    total = len(unique_colors)\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
