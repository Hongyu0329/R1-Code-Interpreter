    """
    Explains the reasoning for identifying the main source of damage
    repaired by TIG welding build-up on aeroengine turbine blades.
    """
    explanation = """
The repair method in question is "manual TIG welding (GTAW) build-up of layers of filler material."
This is an additive process used to restore material that has been lost from a component.

Let's analyze the options:
- A, E (Cracking): While welding can repair cracks, the term "build-up" more strongly implies restoring a worn surface or edge dimension rather than just filling a crack.
- D (Creep Deformation): Creep is the stretching of the blade due to heat and stress. It is a change in shape, not a loss of material that can be fixed by adding layers. Creep damage typically requires blade replacement.
- B, F (FOD, Corrosion): These involve material loss and can be repaired by TIG welding.
- C (Blade Tip Rub and Wear): This is the gradual grinding away of material from the blade tip due to contact with the engine casing. This is a very common issue in engine operation. The "build-up" of weld material is the precise industrial process used to add material back to the tip, restoring its original length and the critical tip-to-casing clearance required for optimal engine efficiency.

Conclusion: Of the choices provided, Blade Tip Rub and Wear is the most common and direct application for a TIG welding "build-up" repair on turbine blades.
