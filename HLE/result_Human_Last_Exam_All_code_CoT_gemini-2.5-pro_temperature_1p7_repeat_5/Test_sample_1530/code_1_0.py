    print(f"The phrase '{poem_phrases['Imagery_of_Cold']}' directly aligns with frost.")

    print(f"The phrase '{poem_phrases['Imagery_of_Creation']}' on plants ('{poem_phrases['Imagery_of_Location']}') describes how frost forms a covering.")
    print(f"The phrase '{poem_phrases['Imagery_of_Antagonist']}' makes sense, as frost is destroyed by the stronger weather of Autumn (wind, rain, sun).")

    print("\n[Analysis for other options]")
    print(f"B. Floodplain: Does not match '{poem_phrases['Imagery_of_Material']}' (lace and glass).")
    print(f"C. Spider: A spider's web is lace-like, but a spider is not inherently '{poem_phrases['Imagery_of_Cold']}'. Frost is a better fit for this description.")
    print(f"D. Autumn as a hunter: The poem's subject ('she') is a separate entity from Autumn ('his... roar'), whom she waits for. So she cannot be Autumn.")
