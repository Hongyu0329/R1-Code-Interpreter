    print("Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, a chiral secondary alkyl halide.")
    print("Reagents: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong and sterically bulky base.")
    print("Reaction Type: This is an E2 elimination reaction.")
    print("Explanation:")
    print("  - A strong, bulky base like t-BuOK favors elimination over substitution.")
    print("  - Due to its steric bulk, the base preferentially removes a proton from the less sterically hindered beta-carbon.")
    print("  - In [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, the beta-carbons are C2 and the methyl group at C4.")
    print("  - The protons on the terminal methyl group (C4) are more accessible than the protons on the internal C2 carbon.")
    print("  - This leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene, a result known as Hofmann elimination.")
    print("\nProduct A is 4-phenylbut-1-ene.")

    # --- Step 2 ---
    print("\n--- Step 2: Formation of Product B ---")
    print("Starting Material: Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene).")
    print("Reagents: 1. Borane in THF (BH3/THF), 2. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).")
    print("Reaction Type: This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction.")
    print("Explanation:")
    print("  - This two-step process adds water (H and OH) across the double bond of the alkene.")
    print("  - The reaction exhibits anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity, meaning the hydroxyl (-OH) group adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond.")
    print("  - In 4-phenylbut-1-ene, the -OH group adds to the terminal carbon (C1 of the butene chain).")
    print("\nProduct B is 4-phenylbutan-1-ol.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # --- Step 3 ---
    print("\n--- Step 3: Formation of Final Product C ---")
    print("Starting Material: Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol), a primary alcohol.")
    print("Reagents: Phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).")
    print("Reaction Type: Conversion of an alcohol to an alkyl bromide.")
    print("Explanation:")
    print("  - PBr3 is a standard reagent used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into their corresponding alkyl bromides.")
    print("  - The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, where the hydroxyl group is converted into a good leaving group and is subsequently displaced by a bromide ion.")
    print("\nFinal Product C is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # --- Final Answer ---
    print("\n### Identity of the Final Product C ###")
    print("The final product, C, is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.")
    print("\nIUPAC Name: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane")
    print("\nChirality Explanation:")
    print("  - The original chirality of the starting material was lost in the first step (E2 elimination), which formed the achiral alkene, 4-phenylbut-1-ene.")
    print("  - Subsequent reactions did not create any new stereocenters.")
    print("  - The final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, does not have any carbon atoms bonded to four different groups.")
    print("  - Therefore, Product C is achiral.")
