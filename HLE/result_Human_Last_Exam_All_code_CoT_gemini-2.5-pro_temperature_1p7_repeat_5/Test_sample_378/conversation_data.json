    "Here is my plan to address your request:\n\n1.  First, I will research the full name of the former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, to verify if \"Azikiwe\" is part of his name.\n2.  My research indicates that his full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria.\n3.  There is no public record or credible source suggesting that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has ever publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". The premise of the question is based on incorrect information.\n4.  Therefore, the answer is that this event never occurred.\n5.  I will write a Python script that prints this information clearly to the user.\n\n```python\ndef find_the_year():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's question about the year\n    Goodluck Ebele Jonathan identified as Azikiwe.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The full name of the former Nigerian President is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n    # \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name. Nnamdi Azikiwe was Nigeria's first president.\n    # There is no record of Goodluck Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe.\n    # Therefore, there is no year to provide.\n    \n    president_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    other_president_name = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n    \n    print(f\"Based on available public records, the person in question is named {president_name}.\")\n    print(f\"He has never publicly identified himself with the name 'Azikiwe', which belongs to Nigeria's first president, {other_president_name}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred.\")\n\nfind_the_year()\n```\n<<<There is no year in which this event occurred as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
