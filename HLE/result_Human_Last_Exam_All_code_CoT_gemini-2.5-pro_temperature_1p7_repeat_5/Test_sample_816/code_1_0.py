# Plan to solve the problem:
# 1. Analyze the described physical phenomenon: Inward flow in a weld pool of 304 stainless steel.
# 2. Evaluate the potential driving forces: Buoyancy, Lorentz, Arc Pressure, Arc Drag, and Marangoni forces.
# 3. Conclude based on the specific material properties and observed flow pattern. 304 stainless steel contains surface-active elements (like sulfur) that reverse the typical behavior of surface tension with temperature.
# 4. In steels, surface tension increases with temperature. The center of the weld pool is the hottest, thus it has the highest surface tension.
# 5. This high surface tension at the center pulls the fluid from the cooler outer regions inwards. This phenomenon is called the Marangoni effect.
# 6. Therefore, the Marangoni force is the dominant mechanism for the observed inward flow.

# Print the explanation
print("The key observation is that the fluid on the surface of the weld pool flows from the cooler outer edges inward to the hotter center.")
print("This specific flow pattern is a classic signature of the Marangoni force (also known as thermocapillary flow) in certain materials.")
print("\nExplanation:")
print("1. The Marangoni force is a shear force that results from a gradient in surface tension across a liquid surface. The fluid is pulled towards the region of higher surface tension.")
print("2. For most pure metals, surface tension decreases as temperature increases, which would cause an outward flow from the hot center. This is contrary to the observation.")
print("3. However, 304 stainless steel contains surface-active elements, notably sulfur. The presence of these elements causes the surface tension to *increase* with temperature in the welding temperature range.")
print("4. Because the center of the weld pool under the arc is the hottest, it has the highest surface tension.")
print("5. This high surface tension in the center pulls the molten metal from the cooler outer edges (which have lower surface tension) inwards.")
print("\nWhile other forces are present, the Marangoni force is the dominant mechanism explaining this characteristic inward flow on the weld pool surface.")
