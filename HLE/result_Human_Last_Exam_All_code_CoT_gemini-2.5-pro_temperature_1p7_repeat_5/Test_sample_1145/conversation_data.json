    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a one-dimensional box. This is a classic quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Recall the Wavefunction**: The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is given by:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n * π * x / a)`\n\n2.  **Find the Probability Density**: The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, `|ψ_n(x)|^2`.\n    `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(n * π * x / a)`\n\n3.  **Integrate over the Interval**: The probability of finding the particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is the integral of the probability density over that interval.\n    `Probability = ∫[x1, x2] (2/a) * sin^2(n * π * x / a) dx`\n\n4.  **Simplify and Substitute**:\n    *   We are given `n = 2`, `x1 = 0.495a`, and `x2 = 0.505a`.\n    *   To simplify, we can perform a change of variables `u = x/a`. This means `du = (1/a)dx`, and our integration limits change from `0.495a` to `0.505a` for `x`, to `0.495` to `0.505` for `u`.\n    *   The integral becomes:\n        `Probability = ∫[0.495, 0.505] 2 * sin^2(2 * π * u) du`\n    *   Notice the length `a` has conveniently cancelled out.\n\n5.  **Calculate Numerically**: This definite integral can be solved accurately using numerical methods. We will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to compute the value. The script will print out the parameters used and the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    within a given interval for a specific quantum state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the constants for the problem based on the user's request.\n    # Quantum state level\n    n = 2\n    # The interval for x is from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n    # We use a change of variables u = x/a, so the integration limits for u are:\n    u1 = 0.495\n    u2 = 0.505\n\n    # The function to integrate is the probability density after the change of variables.\n    # Integrand = 2 * sin^2(n * pi * u)\n    def integrand(u, n_val):\n        return 2 * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * u))**2\n\n    # Perform the numerical integration using scipy.integrate.quad.\n    # The quad function returns the integral result and an estimate of the error.\n    probability, error = quad(integrand, u1, u2, args=(n,))\n\n    # Output the parameters of the problem and the final result.\n    # The user requested to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"Problem: Find the probability of a particle in a 1D box.\")\n    print(f\"The equation for probability is the integral of 2 * sin^2(n * pi * x / a) dx / a\")\n    print(f\"For the quantum state n = {n},\")\n    print(f\"in the interval from x = {u1}*a to {u2}*a.\")\n    \n    # Print the final calculated probability.\n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_probability()\n\n```\n<<<6.44903338875747e-06>>>"
