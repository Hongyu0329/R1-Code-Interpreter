# This is a medical knowledge question.
# The patient shows clear signs of hemorrhagic shock due to a femur fracture.
# Key signs: Tachycardia (160 bpm), severe hypotension (40/60 mmHg), low hemoglobin (6 g/dL), and signs of poor perfusion (cold/clammy skin, disorientation).
# The immediate priority in managing hemorrhagic shock is to restore circulating volume.

# Let's analyze the options:
# A. CPR is for cardiac arrest (no pulse), which this patient does not have.
# B. Anticoagulants would worsen the bleeding and be fatal.
# C. Rapid infusion of isotonic crystalloids (Normal Saline or Ringer's Lactate) is the standard first-line treatment to restore blood volume and pressure. This is the correct answer.
# D. Normal Saline is a correct choice, but C is more complete as Ringer's Lactate is also a primary choice.
# E. Fructose/dextrose is not indicated for initial volume resuscitation in trauma unless there is confirmed hypoglycemia.

# The best and most complete answer is C.
final_answer = 'C'
