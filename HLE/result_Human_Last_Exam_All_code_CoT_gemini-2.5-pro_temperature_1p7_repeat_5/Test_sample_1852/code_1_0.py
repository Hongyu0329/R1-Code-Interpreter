    Solves the problem based on set-theoretic principles.

    The problem asks for delta_1 + delta_2 under the assumption 2^omega_1 = omega_2.

    1. delta_2 is the infimum of the set of regular cardinals lambda that can be lengths
       of maximal towers of uncountable subsets of omega_1. A known result in set
       theory is that the length of such a tower must be greater than omega_1.
       Since lambda must be a regular cardinal, the smallest it can be is omega_2.
       So, delta_2 >= omega_2.

    2. delta_1 is the supremum of such lengths. The length of a tower cannot exceed
       the number of subsets available, which is bounded by 2^omega_1.
       So, delta_1 <= 2^omega_1.

    3. Combining these facts gives: omega_2 <= delta_2 <= delta_1 <= 2^omega_1.

    4. Using the given assumption 2^omega_1 = omega_2, the inequality becomes:
       omega_2 <= delta_2 <= delta_1 <= omega_2.

    5. This implies delta_1 = omega_2 and delta_2 = omega_2.

    6. The final sum is calculated using cardinal arithmetic, where for any infinite
       cardinal kappa, kappa + kappa = kappa.
