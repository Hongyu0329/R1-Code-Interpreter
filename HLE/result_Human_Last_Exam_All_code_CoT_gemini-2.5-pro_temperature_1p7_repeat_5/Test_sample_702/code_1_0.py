    This script calculates the connectivity of the map
    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).

    Method:
    1.  The connectivity of a map f: X -> Y is the largest integer k such that
        the induced map on homotopy groups, pi_i(f), is an isomorphism for
        all i < k and a surjection for i = k.
    2.  First, we compute the connectivity of the domain (X) and the codomain (Y).
        -   The connectivity of the n-sphere S^n is (n-1).
        -   The connectivity of a loop space Omega Z is conn(Z) - 1.
        -   The connectivity of a smash product A wedge B is conn(A) + conn(B) + 1.
        -   The connectivity of a suspension Sigma A is conn(A) + 1.
    3.  If both X and Y are k-connected, the map f is at least k-connected. We find
        this baseline connectivity, k = min(conn(X), conn(Y)).
    4.  We then analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group, pi_{k+1},
        to determine the precise connectivity. Advanced results from homotopy theory
        show that for this specific map, the induced map on pi_{k+1} is not
        surjective. Therefore, the connectivity is exactly k.
