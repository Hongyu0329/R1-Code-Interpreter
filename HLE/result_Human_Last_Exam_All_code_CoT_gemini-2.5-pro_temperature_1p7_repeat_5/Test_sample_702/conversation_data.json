    "Of course, I can help with this advanced problem in algebraic topology. Here is my plan to determine the connectivity of the map:\n\n1.  **Understand the Request**: The goal is to find the connectivity of the map `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`. Connectivity of a map `f` is the largest integer `k` where `πᵢ(f)` is an isomorphism for `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`.\n2.  **Calculate Baseline Connectivity**: I will first compute the connectivity of the domain and the codomain.\n    *   The connectivity of the n-sphere, `Sⁿ`, is `n-1`.\n    *   The connectivity of a loop space `ΩX` is `conn(X) - 1`.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product `X ∧ Y` is `conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1`.\n    *   The connectivity of a suspension `ΣX` is `conn(X) + 1`.\n    The map's connectivity is at least the minimum of the connectivities of the domain and codomain.\n3.  **Analyze the First Non-Trivial Homotopy Group**: I will find the first dimension `k+1` where the homotopy groups of the domain and codomain are non-trivial and analyze the map `πₖ₊₁(f)`.\n4.  **Final Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, which involves results from advanced homotopy theory, I will determine if the map `πₖ₊₁(f)` is surjective. If it is not, the connectivity is `k`.\n5.  **Code Generation**: I will provide a Python script that programmatically performs these calculations and explains each step, ultimately printing the final connectivity value.\n\nHere is the Python code that carries out this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the connectivity of the map\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n\n    Method:\n    1.  The connectivity of a map f: X -> Y is the largest integer k such that\n        the induced map on homotopy groups, pi_i(f), is an isomorphism for\n        all i < k and a surjection for i = k.\n    2.  First, we compute the connectivity of the domain (X) and the codomain (Y).\n        -   The connectivity of the n-sphere S^n is (n-1).\n        -   The connectivity of a loop space Omega Z is conn(Z) - 1.\n        -   The connectivity of a smash product A wedge B is conn(A) + conn(B) + 1.\n        -   The connectivity of a suspension Sigma A is conn(A) + 1.\n    3.  If both X and Y are k-connected, the map f is at least k-connected. We find\n        this baseline connectivity, k = min(conn(X), conn(Y)).\n    4.  We then analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group, pi_{k+1},\n        to determine the precise connectivity. Advanced results from homotopy theory\n        show that for this specific map, the induced map on pi_{k+1} is not\n        surjective. Therefore, the connectivity is exactly k.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 4\n    m = 6\n    print(f\"We are calculating the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^{n} wedge Omega S^{m}) -> Omega(S^{n} wedge S^{m}).\")\n\n    # Domain connectivity\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Connectivity of the Domain ---\")\n    conn_omega_sn = n - 2\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^{n} is n-2 = {n}-2 = {conn_omega_sn}\")\n    conn_omega_sm = m - 2\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^{m} is m-2 = {m}-2 = {conn_omega_sm}\")\n    conn_wedge = conn_omega_sn + conn_omega_sm + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of (Omega S^{n} wedge Omega S^{m}) is conn(Omega S^{n}) + conn(Omega S^{m}) + 1 = {conn_omega_sn} + {conn_omega_sm} + 1 = {conn_wedge}\")\n    conn_domain = conn_wedge + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the domain Sigma(Omega S^{n} wedge Omega S^{m}) is conn(wedge) + 1 = {conn_wedge} + 1 = {conn_domain}\")\n\n    # Codomain connectivity\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Connectivity of the Codomain ---\")\n    smash_dim = n + m\n    print(f\"The smash product S^{n} wedge S^{m} is homotopy equivalent to S^{n+m} = S^{smash_dim}\")\n    conn_smash = smash_dim - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of S^{n+m} is (n+m)-1 = {smash_dim}-1 = {conn_smash}\")\n    conn_codomain = conn_smash - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the codomain Omega(S^{n+m}) is conn(S^{n+m})-1 = {conn_smash}-1 = {conn_codomain}\")\n\n    # Final result\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Final Connectivity of the Map ---\")\n    base_connectivity = min(conn_domain, conn_codomain)\n    print(f\"Both domain and codomain are {base_connectivity}-connected.
