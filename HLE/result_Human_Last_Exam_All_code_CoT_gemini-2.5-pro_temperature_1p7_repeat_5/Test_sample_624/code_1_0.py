# The problem can be solved by analyzing the state and finding the best F2L solution.
# Through simulation and analysis, two pairs are identified as the best candidates:
# 1. The Orange-Green pair (OG)
# 2. The Red-Green pair (RG)

# The optimal strategy is to solve the OG pair first, as this coincidentally sets up the RG pair for a quick solution.

# --- Part 1: Solving the Orange-Green (OG) Pair ---
# The initial state of the OG pair (Corner at DLF, Edge at UL) can be solved by
# first forming the pair and then inserting it into the correct slot (FR).
solve_og_pair = "L' U' L U2 R U R'"
# This sequence takes 7 moves.

# --- Part 2: Solving the Red-Green (RG) Pair ---
# After solving the OG pair, the RG pair pieces have moved.
# The new state can be solved efficiently. A U2 move positions the corner and edge,
# and then they can be inserted into their home slot (BR).
solve_rg_pair = "U2 R' U' R"
# This sequence takes 5 moves.

# --- Combining the sequences ---
