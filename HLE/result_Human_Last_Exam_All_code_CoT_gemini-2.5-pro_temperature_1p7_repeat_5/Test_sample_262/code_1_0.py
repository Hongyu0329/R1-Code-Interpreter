    Analyzes color palettes for monochromatic vision interpretability.

    Monochromatic vision relies on perceiving differences in luminance (brightness)
    to distinguish between elements in a plot.

    - Plot 1 & 6 use qualitative palettes (ggplot default, hue_pal) which have
      colors with similar luminance and are thus unsuitable.
    - Plot 3 & 4 use HSLuv palettes with a constant Lightness component, making
      the colors appear as the same shade of gray. They are unsuitable.
    - Plot 5 uses a palette where two of the five colors have the same Lightness
      value (L=20), making those two categories indistinguishable. It is not
      fully interpretable.
    - Plot 2 uses a diverging palette (ocean.balance) which is designed with a
      wide range of luminance from dark to light, making it interpretable.
