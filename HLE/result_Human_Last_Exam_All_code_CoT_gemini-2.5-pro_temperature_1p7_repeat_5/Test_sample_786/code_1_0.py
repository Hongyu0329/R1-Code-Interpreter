k = 10**6

# The best-known polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the Multicut problem
# achieves an approximation factor of O(log k). We calculate the value for this
# factor, which corresponds to answer choice C.
# The use of log() in math module defaults to the natural logarithm (base e),
# which matches the calculation provided in the question's option C.
log_k = math.log(k)

# For comparison, we also calculate the value for the hypothetical approximation
# from answer choice B.
