The edges become progressively smoother as sharp corners are rounded off. The total length of the edges decreases as the boundaries contract. This causes convex shapes to shrink and concave features to be filled in. As time ($t$) approaches infinity, any isolated object will eventually disappear, and the image will converge to a single uniform color.
