    "To find the equilibrium point of the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, we'll follow the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Game Elements**: We'll set up the players, their possible strategies, the initial quantum state, and the payoff matrix. The key strategies are Cooperate (C), Defect (D), and a special Quantum strategy (Q).\n2.  **Quantum Setup**: The game starts with two qubits in a maximally entangled state, created by an entangling operator `J` acting on the base state `|Cooperate, Cooperate>`.\n3.  **Strategies as Quantum Gates**: Player strategies are represented by quantum gates (unitary operators) applied to their respective qubits. We will use the standard operators for C, D, and Q from the EWL protocol.\n    *   `C = Identity`\n    *   `D = U(π, 0)` (a specific rotation, often called quantum Defection)\n    *   `Q = U(0, π/2)` (the \"miracle\" quantum strategy)\n4.  **Calculate Payoffs**: After the players apply their strategy gates, a disentangling operator `J†` is applied, and the state is measured. The probability of each classical outcome (CC, CD, DC, DD) is calculated, and the expected payoff is determined using the given payoff matrix.\n5.  **Identify the Nash Equilibrium**: A Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. We will analyze the payoffs for different strategy combinations, specifically focusing on the new game created by introducing the `Q` strategy alongside the classical `D` strategy. We will see if `(Q,Q)` is stable or if players have an incentive to deviate.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: We will write a Python script using `numpy` to perform the quantum calculations and derive the payoffs for the key strategic encounters. This will allow us to construct a new payoff matrix for the quantum game and find its equilibrium.\n\nThe script will demonstrate that even with the quantum strategy `Q`, which promises a mutually beneficial outcome of (5,5), a player can get an even better payoff (7) by unilaterally switching to the Defect strategy `D`. This means the `(Q,Q)` state is not a stable equilibrium. The resulting game between strategies `Q` and `D` is itself a Prisoner's Dilemma, whose Nash Equilibrium is for both players to defect, leading to a payoff of (1,1).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Payoff matrix values\n# (C,C) -> (R,R); (C,D) -> (S,T); (D,C) -> (T,S); (D,D) -> (P,P)\nR = 5  # Reward for mutual cooperation\nS = 0  # Sucker's payoff\nT = 7  # Temptation to defect\nP = 1  # Punishment for mutual defection\n\n# Basis states |C> = |0> and |D_state> = |1>\nC_state = np.array([1, 0])\nD_state = np.array([0, 1])\n\n# Two-qubit basis states\nCC = np.kron(C_state, C_state)\nCD = np.kron(C_state, D_state)\nDC = np.kron(D_state, C_state)\nDD = np.kron(D_state, D_state)\n\n# Pauli Matrices\nsigma_x = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], [1j, 0]])\nsigma_z = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\nidentity = np.identity(2)\n\n# Entangling operator J for maximal entanglement (gamma = pi/2)\ngamma = np.pi / 2\nJ = np.cos(gamma / 2) * np.identity(4) + 1j * np.sin(gamma / 2) * np.kron(sigma_x, sigma_x)\nJ_dagger = J.conj().T\n\n# Player Strategies (Quantum Gates)\n# C_op: Cooperate = Identity\nC_op = identity\n# D_op: Defect = U(pi, 0)\nD_op = np.array([[0, 1], [-1, 0]])\n# Q_op: Quantum = U(0, pi/2)\nQ_op = np.array([[1j, 0], [0, -1j]])\n\n# Initial entangled state\npsi_in = J @ CC\n\ndef calculate_payoffs(U_A, U_B):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the final state and expected payoffs for players A and B.\"\"\"\n    # State after players apply their strategies\n    psi_out = np.kron(U_A, U_B) @ psi_in\n    \n    # Final state after disentanglement\n    psi_final = J_dagger @ psi_out\n    \n    # Probabilities of classical outcomes\n    probs = {\n        'CC': np.abs(CC.conj().T @ psi_final)**2,\n        'CD': np.abs(CD.conj().T @ psi_final)**2,\n        'DC': np.abs(DC.conj().T @ psi_final)**2,\n        'DD': np.abs(DD.conj().T @ psi_final)**2\n    }\n    \n    # Expected payoffs\n    payoff_A = probs['CC'] * R + probs['CD'] * S + probs['DC'] * T + probs['DD'] * P\n    payoff_B = probs['CC'] * R + probs['CD'] * T + probs['DC'] * S + probs['DD'] * P\n    \n    return payoff_A, payoff_B, probs\n\n# --- Analysis ---\n# 1.
