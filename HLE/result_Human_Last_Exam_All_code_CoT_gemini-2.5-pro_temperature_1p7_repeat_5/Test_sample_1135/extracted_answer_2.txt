The matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for triply-excited determinants, quadruply-excited determinants, and all other higher-order excited Slater determinants that are not connected to the reference state by $\bar{H}$. Because the electronic Hamiltonian contains up to two-body terms, the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of $\bar{H} = e^{-T} H e^T$ in CCSD (where $T = T_1+T_2$) contains at most four-fold commutators. The operator $\bar{H}$ thus contains at most six-body components. Consequently, $\bar{H}$ cannot connect the reference determinant to any determinants with an excitation level of seven or more. Therefore, the matrix element is zero for all septuply-excited, octuply-excited, and higher excited Slater determinants.
