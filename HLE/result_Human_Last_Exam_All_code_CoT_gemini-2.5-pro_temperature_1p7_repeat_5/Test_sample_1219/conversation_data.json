    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform calculations with very high precision because 10^100 (a googol) is an enormous number. Standard floating-point arithmetic is insufficient.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Periodicity of Tangent**: The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. Our problem thus simplifies to calculating `tan(10^100 mod π)`.\n2.  **High-Precision Arithmetic**: To compute this, we need a library that handles numbers with arbitrary precision. Python's built-in `decimal` module is perfect for this task.\n3.  **Calculating the Remainder**: We will set the precision of the `decimal` context to be high enough (e.g., 115 digits) to handle the magnitude of 10^100 and to get an accurate remainder. We also need a very precise value of π. The calculation will be `r = 10^100 % π`.\n4.  **Calculating the Tangent**: The `decimal` module does not have a built-in `tan` function. We can implement it using the identity `tan(r) = sin(r) / cos(r)`. The `sin` and `cos` functions can, in turn, be implemented using their Taylor series expansions, which are `sin(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - ...` and `cos(x) = 1 - x²/2! + x⁴/4! - ...`. To ensure the series converge quickly, we will first normalize the remainder `r` to the range (-π/2, π/2).\n5.  **Extracting the Digits**: Once we have the high-precision result for `tan(10^100)`, we will convert it to a string and extract the first three digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef sin(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes sin(x) for a decimal.Decimal object x using its Taylor series.\n    Assumes decimal context precision is already set.\n    \"\"\"\n    getcontext = decimal.getcontext\n    x_squared = x * x\n    i = 1\n    last_s = decimal.Decimal(0)\n    s = x\n    term = x\n    # The loop continues until the term is too small to affect the sum\n    while s != last_s:\n        last_s = s\n        i += 2\n        term *= -x_squared / (i * (i - 1))\n        s += term\n    return s\n\ndef cos(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes cos(x) for a decimal.Decimal object x using its Taylor series.\n    Assumes decimal context precision is already set.\n    \"\"\"\n    getcontext = decimal.getcontext\n    x_squared = x * x\n    i = 0\n    last_s = decimal.Decimal(0)\n    s = decimal.Decimal(1)\n    term = decimal.Decimal(1)\n    # The loop continues until the term is too small to affect the sum\n    while s != last_s:\n        last_s = s\n        i += 2\n        term *= -x_squared / (i * (i - 1))\n        s += term\n    return s\n\ndef find_tan_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates tan(10^100) to high precision and finds the first 3 digits\n    after the decimal point.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set precision: 100 for the magnitude + 15 for decimal places and guards\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = 115\n    D = decimal.Decimal\n\n    # A high-precision value of Pi (115 decimal places)\n    pi_str = \"3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679821480865132\"\n    pi = D(pi_str)\n\n    # The number to take the tangent of\n    x = D(10) ** 100\n\n    # tan(x) is periodic with pi, so we find x mod pi.\n    # r = x % pi is equivalent to r = x - (x // pi) * pi\n    r = x % pi\n\n    # For faster convergence of Taylor series, we map r to the range (-pi/2, pi/2).\n    # tan(r) = tan(r - pi)\n    pi_half = pi / 2\n    if r > pi_half:\n        r = r - pi\n    \n    # Calculate tan(r) using tan(r) = sin(r) / cos(r)\n    sin_r = sin(r)\n    cos_r = cos(r)\n    tan_val = sin_r / cos_r\n\n    # Extract the first 3 digits after the comma (decimal point)\n    # Convert the absolute value to a string to handle the sign\n    tan_val_str = str(tan_val.copy_abs())\n    \n    # Find the part after the decimal point\n    if '.' in tan_val_str:\n        after_comma = tan_val_str.split('.')[1]\n        first_three_digits = after_comma[:3]\n    else:\n        first_three_digits = \"000\"\n\n    print(f\"The equation is tan(10^100) = tan({x % pi})\")\n    print(f\"The value of tan(10^100) is approximately: {tan_val}\")\n    print(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_tan_digits()\n```\n<<<220>>>"
