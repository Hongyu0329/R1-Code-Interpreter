    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the connection between a generalized Markov number, denoted as $m_{p/q}$, and the continued fraction of the rational number $p/q$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Definition**: The generalized Markov number $m_{p/q}$ for a rational number $p/q$ (where $0 < p/q < 1$) is defined based on the coefficients of the continued fraction of $p/q$.\n2.  **Find the Continued Fraction**: The first step is to compute the continued fraction of $r = 4/7$. For a rational number in $(0, 1)$, the continued fraction has the form:\n    $$ \\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{1}{k_1 + \\frac{1}{k_2 + \\frac{1}{\\ddots + \\frac{1}{k_n}}}} $$\n    We need to find the integer coefficients $k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n$.\n3.  **Construct the Final Output**: The request asks to compute the \"continued fraction associated with\" $m_{4/7}$. This is precisely the continued fraction of $4/7$ that is used to define it. The python script will compute these coefficients and then print the full continued fraction equation.\n4.  **Final Answer Calculation**: Although not explicitly asked for in the script, the value of the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$ is calculated as $\\text{Tr}(L(k_n) \\cdots L(k_2) L(k_1))$, where $L(k) = \\begin{pmatrix} k & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This value will be provided as the final answer in the required format. For $4/7 = [1, 1, 3]$, this value is $m_{4/7} = \\text{Tr}(L(3)L(1)L(1)) = -2$.\n\nThe following python code implements this plan, focusing on computing and displaying the continued fraction of $4/7$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_and_display_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction for p/q (for 0 < p/q < 1)\n    and prints it in an expanded equation format.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (isinstance(p, int) and isinstance(q, int) and 0 < p < q):\n        print(\"Error: Input must be a rational number p/q where p and q are integers and 0 < p/q < 1.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Computing the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{p}/{q}.\")\n    print(f\"This is the continued fraction of the rational number {p}/{q} itself.\\n\")\n\n    # Algorithm to find continued fraction coefficients\n    # for p/q = 1/(k1 + 1/(k2 + ...))\n    coeffs = []\n    temp_p, temp_q = p, q\n    while temp_p > 0:\n        k = temp_q // temp_p\n        coeffs.append(k)\n        temp_q, temp_p = temp_p, temp_q % temp_p\n\n    print(f\"The coefficients [k1, k2, ...] for {p}/{q} are: {coeffs}\\n\")\n\n    # Build and print the final equation string\n    # This fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    equation_str = str(coeffs[-1])\n    for k in reversed(coeffs[:-1]):\n        equation_str = f\"({k} + 1 / {equation_str})\"\n\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{p}/{q} = 1 / {equation_str}\")\n\n\n# Main execution for the specific case of m_{4/7}\np_val = 4\nq_val = 7\ncompute_and_display_cf(p_val, q_val)\n```\n<<<-2>>>"
