# The problem is to find the 50th segmented number.
# As determined by the analysis, segmented numbers are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).
# The Nth segmented number is given by the formula 2^(N-1).

# Step 1: Define the position of the element we want to find.
n = 50

# Step 2: The formula is base ** (n - 1).
# Define the base and the exponent for the calculation.
base = 2
exponent = n - 1

# Step 3: Calculate the result. Python's integers can handle arbitrary size.
result = base ** exponent

# Step 4: Print the final equation showing all the numbers involved.
# The final equation is result = base ** exponent.
print(f"The {n}th segmented number is found using the equation {base} ** {exponent}.")
print(f"The result is: {result}")
