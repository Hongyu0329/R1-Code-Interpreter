    "The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria catalysts is a key parameter determined through experimental research, as it heavily influences the catalyst's structure, the number of active sites, and the interaction between nickel and the ceria support. Different studies might report slightly different optimal values depending on the specific synthesis method and reaction conditions.\n\nHowever, a recurring finding in scientific literature is that a specific molar ratio leads to superior performance by maximizing the dispersion of Ni particles and the formation of crucial oxygen vacancies in the ceria lattice. A study in the journal *Fuel* (DOI: 10.1016/j.fuel.2013.12.016) investigating various Ni/Ce molar ratios for the Water Gas Shift reaction found that a ratio of 2/8 was optimal.\n\nHere is a Python script that calculates and displays this experimentally determined ideal ratio.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_optimal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts\n    based on findings reported in scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is determined experimentally to maximize catalytic performance.\")\n    print(\"A study in the journal Fuel (DOI: 10.1016/j.fuel.2013.12.016) identified an optimal composition.\")\n    \n    # Optimal molar parts of Nickel (Ni) from the study.\n    ni_molar_parts = 2\n    \n    # Corresponding molar parts of Cerium (Ce).\n    ce_molar_parts = 8\n    \n    # Calculate the optimal ratio.\n    optimal_ratio = ni_molar_parts / ce_molar_parts\n    \n    print(\"\\nBased on the study, the optimal composition is:\")\n    print(f\"Nickel (Ni) parts: {ni_molar_parts}\")\n    print(f\"Cerium (Ce) parts: {ce_molar_parts}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation for the ideal ratio is:\")\n    # The final equation as requested, showing each number.\n    print(f\"{ni_molar_parts} / {ce_molar_parts} = {optimal_ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_optimal_ratio()\n```\n<<<0.25>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Ni-Ceria nanoparticles have shown promising catalytic properties for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS).
