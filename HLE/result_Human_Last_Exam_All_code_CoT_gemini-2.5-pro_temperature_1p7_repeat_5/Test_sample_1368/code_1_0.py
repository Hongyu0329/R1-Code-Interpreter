    # 1. 'L': Draw a Line through the circle's center (P0) and the given point on its circumference (P1). This defines the first diameter (P1, P2).
    # 2. 'C': To construct a perpendicular bisector, draw a Circle centered at P1 with a radius equal to the diameter's length (P1P2).
    # 3. 'C': Draw a second Circle centered at P2, also with radius P2P1.
    # 4. 'L': A Line connecting the intersection points of the two large circles forms the second diameter, which is perpendicular to the first.
    # The intersections of these two diameters with the original circle are the four vertices of the square.
