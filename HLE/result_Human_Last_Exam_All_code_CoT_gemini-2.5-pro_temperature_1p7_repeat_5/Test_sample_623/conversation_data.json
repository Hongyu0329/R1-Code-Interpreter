    "Of course. Here is a Python script that determines the answer by tracing the labeled carbons through the metabolic pathway.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define the Labeled Glucose:** I will start with a glucose molecule where carbons C1 and C4 are isotopically labeled with ¹³C.\n2.  **Simulate Glycolysis:** I'll trace these labeled carbons as the 6-carbon glucose is split into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. This involves tracking which original glucose carbons end up in which positions on the two pyruvate molecules.\n3.  **Simulate Pyruvate Decarboxylation:** While no CO₂ is released during glycolysis itself, the very next step in aerobic respiration is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which releases the first carbon (C1) of pyruvate as CO₂. This is the first point where CO₂ is produced from glucose catabolism.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:** By checking which of the original labeled carbons end up in the C1 position of pyruvate, I can count how many molecules of labeled ¹³CO₂ are released.\n5.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the step-by-step logic and then the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_glycolysis_co2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation\n    to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script determines how many 13C-labeled CO2 molecules are released\")\n    print(\"when a molecule of 1,4-13C glucose is metabolized.\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
