    "My plan is to first research the history of the Piazza della Rotonda, focusing on changes made around the year 1950. I will look for information about structures or features that were removed from the square by the city administration during that period.\n\nOnce I have identified the feature, I will write a simple Python script to print the answer, as requested in the prompt's instructions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical question about the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    feature = \"the ring of tram tracks\"\n    location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n    removed_year = 1950\n\n    answer = (f\"The unique feature removed from the {location} in {removed_year} \"\n              f\"was {feature} that circled the central fountain. \"\n              f\"They were removed by the city administration to accommodate the rise of automobile traffic.\")\n\n    print(answer)\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<The ring of tram tracks>>>"
