    "Here is my step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to know the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) from a list of multiple-choice options. The answer must be presented within a Python script.\n2.  **Gather Information:** I will research the feeding habits of adult Raphidiopterans.\n    *   Adult Raphidiopterans are known to be predatory, primarily feeding on other small, soft-bodied insects like aphids. This validates option E.\n    *   Scientific literature also notes that some adult snakeflies supplement their predatory diet by feeding on nectar and pollen. This validates option A.\n3.  **Evaluate the Choices:**\n    *   A. Nectar: Correct.\n    *   B. Māhoe pollen: Plausible since they eat pollen, but A and E are more definitively and commonly cited.\n    *   C. Fungus: Incorrect.\n    *   D. Karamū leaf tissue: Incorrect, they are not herbivores.\n    *   E. Totara Aphids: Correct, as they are predators of aphids.\n    *   F. A and E: This choice combines the two correct statements.\n    *   G. D and E: This choice combines a correct and an incorrect statement.\n4.  **Formulate the Script:**\n    *   The Python script will not perform a complex calculation but will present the researched information methodically.\n    *   It will print an explanation of why options A and E are correct based on the known diet of snakeflies.\n    *   It will then conclude that option F, which combines A and E, is the most complete and correct answer.\n    *   The script will print out the final conclusion clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_snakefly_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the correct diet for adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    from a list of choices and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the choices provided in the question.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids',\n        'F': 'A and E'\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n    analysis = [\n        \"Adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) are primarily predators.\",\n        \"They are well-documented to feed on small, soft-bodied arthropods, including aphids.\",\n        f\"This makes choice E, '{choices['E']}', a correct statement.\",\n        \"\\nFurthermore, some species of adult snakeflies are also known to supplement their diet.\",\n        \"They have been recorded feeding on pollen and nectar from flowers.\",\n        f\"This makes choice A, '{choices['A']}', also a correct statement.\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of Raphidiopteran diet:\")\n    for step in analysis:\n        print(f\"- {step}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Conclude the best answer based on the analysis.\n    conclusion = f\"\\nSince both statements A and E are correct, the best and most complete answer is the one that combines them.\"\n    \n    print(conclusion)\n    print(f\"Final Answer Choice: {choices['F']}\")\n\nfind_snakefly_diet()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
