# Step 1: Define properties of the Petersen graph.
# The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges.
petersen_vertices = 10
petersen_edges = 15
# The Petersen graph is 3-regular, meaning every vertex has degree 3.
petersen_degree = 3

# Step 2: Determine properties of the line graph of the Petersen graph (Gamma).
# The number of vertices in the line graph is equal to the number of edges in the original graph.
gamma_vertices = petersen_edges

# The number of edges in the line graph can be calculated from the degrees of the vertices in the original graph.
# Since the Petersen graph is 3-regular, each of its 15 edges is adjacent to (3-1) + (3-1) = 4 other edges.
# The total number of edge adjacencies is (num_edges * num_adjacent_edges) / 2 (we divide by 2 as each adjacency is counted twice).
gamma_edges = (petersen_edges * ( (petersen_degree - 1) + (petersen_degree - 1) ) ) // 2

# Step 3: Calculate the first Betti number of Gamma (b1_gamma).
# For a connected graph, b1 = |E| - |V| + 1. The line graph of a connected graph is connected.
b1_gamma = gamma_edges - gamma_vertices + 1

# Step 4: Combine the results using the formula for the l2-Betti number of the graph of groups.
# The formula is l2_b1(G) = b1(Gamma) + sum(l2_b1(G_v)) - sum(l2_b1(G_e)).
# As explained in the plan, the l2-betti number for all vertex and edge groups is 0.
sum_l2_b1_G_v = 0
sum_l2_b1_G_e = 0
final_l2_betti_number = b1_gamma + sum_l2_b1_G_v - sum_l2_b1_G_e

# Print the calculation step-by-step
print("The formula for the first l2-Betti number of the fundamental group G is:")
print("l2_b1(G) = b1(Gamma) + sum(l2_b1(G_v)) - sum(l2_b1(G_e))")
print("\nFirst, we compute b1(Gamma) = |E(Gamma)| - |V(Gamma)| + 1 for the underlying graph Gamma.")
print(f"The number of vertices in Gamma, |V(Gamma)|, is {gamma_vertices}.")
print(f"The number of edges in Gamma, |E(Gamma)|, is {gamma_edges}.")
print(f"So, b1(Gamma) = {gamma_edges} - {gamma_vertices} + 1 = {b1_gamma}.")
print("\nNext, we determine the contributions from the group theory part.")
print(f"The sum of the first l2-Betti numbers of the vertex groups, sum(l2_b1(G_v)), is {sum_l2_b1_G_v}.")
print(f"The sum of the first l2-Betti numbers of the edge groups, sum(l2_b1(G_e)), is {sum_l2_b1_G_e}.")
print("\nFinally, we plug these values into the formula:")
print(f"l2_b1(G) = {b1_gamma} + {sum_l2_b1_G_v} - {sum_l2_b1_G_e} = {final_l2_betti_number}")
print(f"\nThe final result is {final_l2_betti_number}.")
