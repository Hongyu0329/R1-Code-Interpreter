    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand Involutions in PSU(n, q):** An involution `x` in a group is a non-identity element such that `x^2 = 1`. The group PSU(n, q) is defined as SU(n, q) / Z, where Z is the center of the special unitary group SU(n, q). An element `gZ` in PSU(n, q) (where `g` is in SU(n, q)) is an involution if and only if `g` is not in the center Z, and `g^2` is in the center Z.\n\n2.  **Characterize the Center Z:** For SU(n, q), the center Z consists of scalar matrices `ωI` such that `ω^n = 1` and `ω^(q+1) = 1`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    For PSU(4, 997), we have `n = 4` and `q = 997`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    This means the center Z has two elements: `I` (the identity matrix) and `-I`.\n\n3.  **Count Preimages in SU(4, 997):** We need to count the number of elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g ∉ Z` and `g^2 ∈ Z`. This condition `g^2 ∈ Z` splits into two cases:\n    a) `g^2 = I`\n    b) `g^2 = -I`\n\n4.  **Case `g^2 = -I`:** The eigenvalues `λ` of such a matrix `g` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`. For `g` to be in the unitary group U(4, q), its eigenvalues must also satisfy `λ^(q+1) = 1`.\n    Since `q = 997`, and `997 ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, there exists an element `j` in the base field `GF(997)` such that `j^2 = -1`. The eigenvalues must be `j` or `-j`.\n    Let's check the unitary condition for `j`: `j^(q+1) = j^(997+1) = j^998 = (j^2)^499 = (-1)^499 = -1`.\n    Since `j^(q+1) = -1 ≠ 1`, `j` cannot be an eigenvalue of any matrix in U(4, 997). Therefore, there are **zero** elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\n5.  **Case `g^2 = I`:** These are the involutions of SU(4, 997) plus the identity matrix `I`. For an element `g` in SU(n, q), the determinant is 1. If `g` is an involution, its eigenvalues are `+1` and `-1`, and `det(g) = (-1)^k = 1`, where `k` is the number of `-1` eigenvalues. Thus, `k` must be even. For `n=4`, `k` can be 0, 2, or 4.\n    *   `k=0`: The only element is the identity `I`. This element is in the center Z.\n    *   `k=4`: The only element is `-I`. This element is also in the center Z.\n    *   `k=2`: These elements are the involutions that are not in the center. They all belong to a single conjugacy class. The number of such involutions is given by the formula `|GU(4,q)| / |GU(2,q) x GU(2,q)|`. This simplifies to `q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Number:** The set of preimages of involutions in PSU(4,q) is precisely the set of involutions of type `k=2` in SU(4,q). Let's call this set `A`.\n    `|A| = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`.\n    Each involution `x` in PSU(4,q) corresponds to a pair of elements `{g, -g}` in `A`. Therefore, the number of involutions in PSU(4,q) is `|A| / |Z| = |A| / 2`.\n\n    The final formula is: `(q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2`.\n    We will now compute this value for `q=997`.\n\n```python\n# The prime field characteristic is q\nq = 997\n\n# The formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q = 1 (mod 4)\n# is (q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2.\n\n# Calculate the components of the formula\nq_squared = q**2\nq_fourth = q**4\nterm1 = q_squared - q + 1\nterm2 = q_squared + 1\n\n# Calculate the numerator\nnumerator = q_fourth * term1 * term2\n\n# Calculate the final result using integer division\nnum_involutions = numerator // 2\n\n# Print the equation with the computed values\nprint(f\"The number of involutions is calculated by the formula:\")\nprint(f\"N = (q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2\")\nprint(f\"For q = {q}:\")\nprint(f\"N = ({q_fourth} * {term1} * {term2}) / 2\")\nprint(f\"N = {numerator} / 2\")\nprint(f\"N = {num_involutions}\")\n\n```\n<<<487630407118083007215>>>"
