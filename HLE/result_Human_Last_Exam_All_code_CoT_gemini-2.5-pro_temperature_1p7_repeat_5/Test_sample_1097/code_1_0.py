To prove the existence and uniqueness of a global solution to the boundary value problem
u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0, with u(0) = u(1) = 0,
using the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, we first convert it into an integral equation:
u(x) = ∫[from 0 to 1] G(x, s) * exp(u(s)) ds

Here, G(x, s) is the Green's function for the operator u'' with the given boundary conditions.
G(x, s) = { (s - 1) * x,  if 0 ≤ x ≤ s
          { s * (x - 1),  if s ≤ x ≤ 1
The maximum value of the integral of |G(x, s)| over s from 0 to 1 is 1/8.
sup_x ∫[from 0 to 1] |G(x, s)| ds = 1/8.

We define an operator T:
(Tu)(x) = ∫[from 0 to 1] G(x, s) * exp(u(s)) ds

The appropriate set M must be a complete metric space on which T is a contraction mapping from M to M.

    # Definition of the set M
    set_M_definition = """
The set M should be defined as a closed ball of radius R in the space of continuous functions on [0, 1] that are zero at the boundaries.

Specifically, M is the set:

M = {u ∈ C[0, 1] | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and sup_{x∈[0,1]} |u(x)| ≤ R}

where R is a positive constant that must satisfy two conditions for T to be a contraction that maps M to itself:

1. Contraction Condition: The Lipschitz constant k for T must be less than 1.
   k = exp(R) / 8 < 1  =>  exp(R) < 8  =>  R < ln(8)

2. Invariance Condition (T(M) ⊆ M): For any u ∈ M, we must have ||Tu||∞ ≤ R.
   This leads to the condition:
   exp(R) / 8 ≤ R

Therefore, M is defined as the set above for any R > 0 that satisfies BOTH inequalities:

    # Final conditions on R
    ln_8 = math.log(8)

    print(f"Condition 2: {condition2}")
