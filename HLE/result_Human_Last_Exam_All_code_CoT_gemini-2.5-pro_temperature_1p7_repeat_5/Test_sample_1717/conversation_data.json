    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n2.  Second, I will determine the multiplayer health scaling formula for Expert Mode. According to the game's mechanics, boss health increases by a specific percentage for each player present after the first one.\n3.  Third, I will construct the mathematical equation for the boss's health as a function of the number of players, 'N'.\n4.  Finally, I will analyze what happens to this equation as the number of players 'N' approaches infinity. I will create a Python script to display this formula and explain the result, as a direct calculation to infinity is not possible.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_eoc_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health_expert = 3640\n    \n    # Step 2: Define the health scaling factor per player in Expert Mode.\n    # Health increases by 35% of the base health for each player after the first.\n    scaling_per_player = 0.35\n    \n    # Calculate the flat amount of health added per additional player.\n    health_increase_per_player = int(base_health_expert * scaling_per_player)\n    \n    print(\"Determining the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Step 3: Present the formula for N players.\n    print(f\"The base health for one player is: {base_health_expert}\")\n    print(f\"For each additional player, health increases by {scaling_per_player:.0%}, which is a flat value of {health_increase_per_player} HP.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis gives us the general health equation, where 'N' is the number of players:\")\n    \n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health_expert} + ({health_increase_per_player} * (N - 1))\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Analyze the formula for an infinite number of players.\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis for an infinite number of players:\")\n    print(\"The health of the Eye of Cthulhu increases linearly with the number of players ('N').\")\n    print(\"As the value of 'N' grows larger, the Total Health continues to increase without any upper bound.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, as the number of players approaches infinity, the boss's health also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"There is no finite theoretical maximum health value.\")\n\ncalculate_eoc_health()\n```\n<<<Infinity>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    According to the source code of the video game Terraria, in Expert Mode what is the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu given an infinite number of players?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
