    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Symmetries:** The Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (without boundary conditions) is composed of several independent transformations that leave the equations invariant. I will identify each of these symmetry subgroups.\n2.  **Determine the Dimension of Each Subgroup:** For each symmetry type (e.g., translation, rotation), I will determine the number of independent parameters required to define it. This number is the dimension of that particular subgroup.\n3.  **Sum the Dimensions:** The dimension of the full Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of its individual symmetry subgroups.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will assign each dimension to a variable, print out the equation showing the sum of these dimensions, and then compute and print the final result.\n\nThe symmetry subgroups and their dimensions are:\n*   **Time translations:** Shifting time by a constant ($t' = t + a_0$). This is 1 parameter.\n*   **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates by a constant vector ($\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}_1$). This is 3 parameters.\n*   **Spatial rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates ($\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$). The rotation group SO(3) has 3 parameters.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a constantly moving reference frame ($\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t, \\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$). The boost velocity vector has 3 parameters.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure leaves the equations invariant. This is a single-parameter group.\n*   **Pressure shift:** The pressure $p$ only appears as a gradient ($\\nabla p$), so adding a constant to it ($p' = p + c$) is a symmetry. This is 1 parameter.\n\nNow, I will sum these dimensions using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible\n# Navier-Stokes equations in R^3 is the sum of the dimensions of its\n# constituent symmetry subgroups.\n\n# Dimension of the time translation group (t' = t + a)\ntime_translations_dim = 1\n\n# Dimension of the space translation group (x' = x + a) in R^3\nspace_translations_dim = 3\n\n# Dimension of the spatial rotation group SO(3)\nspatial_rotations_dim = 3\n\n# Dimension of the Galilean boosts group (v' = v + v_0) in R^3\ngalilean_boosts_dim = 3\n\n# Dimension of the scaling transformations group\nscaling_transformations_dim = 1\n\n# Dimension of the pressure shift group (p' = p + c)\npressure_shift_dim = 1\n\n# The total dimension is the sum of these individual dimensions.\ntotal_dimension = (time_translations_dim + \n                   space_translations_dim + \n                   spatial_rotations_dim + \n                   galilean_boosts_dim + \n                   scaling_transformations_dim + \n                   pressure_shift_dim)\n\n# Display the calculation, showing each number in the final equation.\nprint(\"The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions from each symmetry group:\")\nprint(f\"Total Dimension = (Time Translations) + (Space Translations) + (Spatial Rotations) + (Galilean Boosts) + (Scaling) + (Pressure Shift)\")\nprint(f\"Total Dimension = {time_translations_dim} + {space_translations_dim} + {spatial_rotations_dim} + {galilean_boosts_dim} + {scaling_transformations_dim} + {pressure_shift_dim}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final calculated dimension is: {total_dimension}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n<<<12>>>\")\n```"
