    "The user wants to identify the product of a specific Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction involves an aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and a phosphonium ylide, which is characteristic of a Wittig reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal. Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`. The key functional group is the carbonyl (`C=O`).\n    *   **Phosphonium Ylide:** The name is `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane`. Let's parse this to determine its structure.\n        *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane` refers to the `PPh₃` group.\n        *   `ethylidene` refers to a two-carbon chain attached to the phosphorus, typically `...=CH-CH₃`.\n        *   `2-(2-chlorophenyl)` means a 2-chlorophenyl group is attached to the second carbon of the ethyl chain.\n        *   Combining these parts, the structure is `(2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃`. This is a triphenylphosphonium ylide.\n3.  **Determine the Product:**\n    *   In a Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde and the `=PPh₃` group of the ylide are eliminated and replaced by a new carbon-carbon double bond. The byproduct is triphenylphosphine oxide (`O=PPh₃`).\n    *   The new double bond forms between the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde and the ylide carbon (the one bonded to phosphorus).\n    *   The fragments to be joined are:\n        *   From pivalaldehyde: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`\n        *   From the ylide: `=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`\n    *   Joining them gives the product: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`.\n4.  **Name the Product (IUPAC):**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a 5-carbon chain (a pentene).\n    *   Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant (position 2), we get `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n5.  **Predict Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The stereochemistry of the resulting alkene (E/Z isomerism) depends on the nature of the ylide.\n    *   Ylides with simple alkyl groups (like the `CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)` group here) are considered \"unstabilized\".\n    *   Wittig reactions with unstabilized ylides predominantly yield the *Z* (or *cis*) alkene.\n    *   Therefore, the major product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n6.  **Formulate Python Code:** Create a Python script to present this information clearly, including the full reaction equation with molecular formulas to satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the specified Wittig reaction, identifies the products,\n    and prints the results in a structured format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
