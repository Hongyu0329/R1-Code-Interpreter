# The patient is acutely violent and failed initial monotherapy (5mg Zyprexa).
# The immediate priority is to safely and effectively control the agitation to protect the patient and staff.
# Combination therapy with an antipsychotic and a benzodiazepine is a standard and effective approach for severe agitation.

# Define the medications and doses from the best option.
lorazepam_dose_mg = 2
repeat_olanzapine_dose_mg = 5
initial_olanzapine_dose_mg = 5

# Calculate the total dose of olanzapine
total_olanzapine_dose_mg = initial_olanzapine_dose_mg + repeat_olanzapine_dose_mg

print("Rationale: The patient's agitation did not respond to initial monotherapy. The best next step is to use combination therapy for a synergistic effect.")
print("The chosen intervention combines a benzodiazepine with a second-generation antipsychotic, which is a standard of care for severe agitation.")
print("The IM route is safer than IV in a combative patient.")
print(f"The recommended additional medications are {lorazepam_dose_mg}mg IM lorazepam and {repeat_olanzapine_dose_mg}mg IM olanzapine.")
print(f"This leads to a total olanzapine dose of: {initial_olanzapine_dose_mg}mg + {repeat_olanzapine_dose_mg}mg = {total_olanzapine_dose_mg}mg.")
