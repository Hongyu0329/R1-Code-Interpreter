    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm, we need to combine the given membership values. A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logical AND operation. The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator, which I will use for this calculation.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the two input values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values. The rule activation level will be the minimum of the two numbers.\n3.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_activation_level():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for a fuzzy set using a minimum t-norm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values for the problem\n    phi_k = 0.7\n    mu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n    # The rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation\n    # to the firing strengths. We will use the most common t-norm, the minimum operator.\n    activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n    # Print the process and the result\n    print(\"Calculating the rule activation level using the minimum t-norm:\")\n    print(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\n    print(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\n    print(f\"Result: {activation_level}\")\n\ncalculate_activation_level()\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
