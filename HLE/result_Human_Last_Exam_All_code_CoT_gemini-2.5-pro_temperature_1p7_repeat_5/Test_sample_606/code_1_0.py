    # Plan:
    # 1. Define N_eff: N_eff parameterizes the universe's radiation energy density.
    #    The total radiation energy density (rho_rad) is given by:
    #    rho_rad = rho_gamma * (1 + (7/8) * (T_nu/T_gamma)^4 * N_eff)
    #    Essentially, N_eff measures the energy density of neutrinos (and any other
    #    dark radiation) relative to the energy density of photons.
    
    # 2. Standard Model (SM) Baseline:
    #    In the SM, N_eff is primarily determined by the 3 neutrino species.
    #    For simplicity, we'll treat N_eff_SM as exactly 3.
    N_eff_sm = 3.044 # Standard Model value

    # 3. New Physics Scenario: A new particle decays and injects energy into neutrinos.
    #    This extra energy, delta_rho_nu, adds to the total neutrino energy density.
    #    The change in N_eff is directly proportional to this injected energy.
    #    Let's assume the decay increases the energy budget of "dark radiation" by
    #    an amount equivalent to a certain number of extra neutrino species.
    #    This is a conceptual, positive value.
    delta_N_eff = 0.5 # An illustrative increase in N_eff due to the decay

    print("-" * 30)

    # 4. Final Calculation:
    #    The new N_eff is the sum of the standard model value and the additional
    #    contribution from the new particle decay.
    N_eff_new = N_eff_sm + delta_N_eff
