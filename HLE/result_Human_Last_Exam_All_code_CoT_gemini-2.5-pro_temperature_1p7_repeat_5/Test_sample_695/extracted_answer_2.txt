--- PFOS Accumulation Calculation ---
The net accumulation rate of PFOS in fish after 365 days is calculated as follows:
Accumulation = (C(t) * Qgills * AFgills) + (Cfood * IRfood * AFfood) - (kelim * Cfish * Mfish)
Accumulation = (0.935 ng/L * 100 L/day * 0.8) + (100 ng/g * 20 g/day * 0.9) - (0.069 days⁻¹ * 10 ng/g * 1000 g)
Result: 1184.83 ng/day

--- PFOA Accumulation Calculation ---
The net accumulation rate of PFOA in fish after 365 days is calculated as follows:
Accumulation = (C(t) * Qgills * AFgills) + (Cfood * IRfood * AFfood) - (kelim * Cfish * Mfish)
Accumulation = (75944.402 ng/L * 100 L/day * 0.8) + (100 ng/g * 20 g/day * 0.9) - (0.023 days⁻¹ * 10 ng/g * 1000 g)
Result: 6077122.18 ng/day
