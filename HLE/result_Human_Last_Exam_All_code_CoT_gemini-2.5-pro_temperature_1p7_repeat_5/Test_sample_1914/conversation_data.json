    "Of course. Finding the number of non-isomorphic categories with a small, finite number of objects and morphisms is a combinatorial problem. We can solve this by systematically generating all possible category structures and then filtering out any that are isomorphic to each other.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Represent the Category Structure**: I'll represent the 2 objects as `0` and `1`. The 4 morphisms will be represented by integers `0, 1, 2, 3`. By definition, two of these must be identity morphisms.\n    *   `morphism 0`: `id_0` on object `0`.\n    *   `morphism 1`: `id_1` on object `1`.\n    *   `morphism 2`: `f`, a non-identity morphism.\n    *   `morphism 3`: `g`, a non-identity morphism.\n\n2.  **Enumerate All \"Shapes\"**: A category's \"shape\" is determined by the domain and codomain of its non-identity morphisms, `f` and `g`. I'll iterate through all possible assignments of `(domain, codomain)` for `f` and `g`.\n\n3.  **Enumerate All Composition Tables**: For each shape, I'll determine all possible ways to define the composition of morphisms (e.g., `f ∘ f`, `f ∘ g`, etc.), respecting the domains and codomains. The result of any composition must be one of the 4 existing morphisms.\n\n4.  **Validate the Category Axioms**: For each generated structure (shape + composition table), I'll check if it satisfies the two fundamental axioms of a category:\n    *   **Identity Law**: `f ∘ id_domain = f` and `id_codomain ∘ f = f`. This will be enforced during the table generation.\n    *   **Associativity**: `h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘ g) ∘ f` for all composable morphisms `f, g, h`. This is the main validation check.\n\n5.  **Filter for Isomorphism**: This is the most complex step. Two categories are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by simply relabeling the objects and the non-identity morphisms. For each valid category I find, I will generate all its possible relabeled versions (swapping objects, swapping `f` and `g`, or both) and create a single, unique \"canonical representation\" for this entire family. I'll store these canonical forms in a set to ensure I only count each unique isomorphism class once.\n\n6.  **Print the Results**: Finally, I will print the total count of unique categories found and list the structure of each one.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts all non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Data Representation ---\n    # Objects: 0, 1\n    # Morphisms: id_0 (0), id_1 (1), f (2), g (3)\n    # Morphism properties: m_props[id] = (domain, codomain)\n    # Composition: comp_table[h][g] = result of h o g\n\n    found_canonicals = set()\n    final_results = []\n    \n    obj_map = ['O0', 'O1']\n    mor_map = ['id_0', 'id_1', 'f', 'g']\n\n    # Possible (dom, cod) types for f and g\n    obj_pairs = list(itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=2))\n\n    # --- 1.
