    "Answering this question requires us to find the absolute minimum number of isometric embeddings, which means we are free to choose the finite ultrametric space $X$ and the Banach space $B$ (with cardinality $K$) to make this number as small as possible.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The goal is to find the value of `min_{X, B} |Isom(X, B)|`, where $X$ is any finite ultrametric space and $B$ is any Banach space. `Isom(X, B)` is the set of all isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$.\n\n2.  **Can the number be 0?** For any given finite ultrametric space $X$, it is always possible to construct an isometric embedding into a suitable Banach space. A standard construction embeds $X$ into $l_{\\infty}(X)$, the space of bounded functions on $X$, which is a Banach space. This means we can always choose a $B$ such that embeddings exist. Therefore, the minimum number is greater than 0.\n\n3.  **Can the number be 1?** Let's try to construct a scenario where there is exactly one isometric embedding. To minimize the number of mappings, we should choose the simplest possible spaces for $X$ and $B$.\n\n    *   **Choice of X:** Let's choose the simplest non-empty finite ultrametric space: a single-point space, $X = \\{p\\}$. The only distance is $d(p, p) = 0$. The ultrametric inequality $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ holds trivially.\n\n    *   **Choice of B:** Let's choose the simplest Banach space: the trivial vector space $B = \\{0\\}$ over the real numbers. The norm is $||0|| = 0$. This space is complete, so it is a Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n\n4.  **Count the Embeddings:** Now we need to find all isometric embeddings $f: X \\to B$ for our chosen $X$ and $B$.\n    *   An embedding is a function $f: \\{p\\} \\to \\{0\\}$. There is only one possible function: the one that maps the point $p$ to the vector $0$. Let's call this function $f_0$, so $f_0(p) = 0$.\n    *   Next, we must verify if this function $f_0$ is an isometry. The condition for an isometry is that for all points $x, y$ in $X$, the equation $||f(x) - f(y)||_B = d(x, y)$ must hold.\n    *   In our case, the only pair of points is $(p, p)$. We must check if $||f_0(p) - f_0(p)|| = d(p, p)$.\n    *   Let's substitute the values:\n        *   Left side: $||f_0(p) - f_0(p)|| = ||0 - 0|| = ||0|| = 0$.\n        *   Right side: $d(p, p) = 0$.\n    *   Since $0 = 0$, the condition holds. The function $f_0$ is an isometric embedding.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We have found a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which there is exactly one function from $X$ to $B$, and this single function is an isometric embedding. Therefore, the number of isometric embeddings is 1. Since we already established the number cannot be 0, the smallest possible number is 1.\n\nThe following Python code formally demonstrates this specific case to show that the minimum number is 1.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings\n    of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n\n    The strategy is to find the minimum by selecting the simplest possible X and B.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
