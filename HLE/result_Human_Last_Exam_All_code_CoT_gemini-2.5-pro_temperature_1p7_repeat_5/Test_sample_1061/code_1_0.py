        "The declining 13C ratio in tree rings is primarily influenced by two factors: the global atmospheric "

        "1. Global Trend (Suess Effect): The burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution has released "
        "large amounts of CO2 depleted in 13C, causing a global decline in the atmospheric 13C ratio. "
        "Trees record this baseline trend.\n\n"
        "2. Regional Climate (Water Availability): In wet conditions, trees easily absorb CO2 and can preferentially "
        "use the lighter 12C isotope, resulting in a lower 13C ratio. During drought, trees are water-stressed "
        "and less selective, resulting in a higher 13C ratio.\n\n"
        "Analysis of Options:\n"
        "For Chinese pine trees, the SE Asia monsoon is the dominant driver of water availability. A long-term "
        "change in the monsoon's strength directly impacts rainfall and thus the tree's 13C ratio. 'Periods of "
        "drought' (B) is incorrect because it would cause an increase, not a decline. The other options are "
        "secondary effects. Therefore, changes in the monsoon are the most significant regional factor among "
        "the choices."
