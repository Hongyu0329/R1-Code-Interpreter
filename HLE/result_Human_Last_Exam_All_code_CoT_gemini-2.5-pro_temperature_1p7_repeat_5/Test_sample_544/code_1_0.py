# The reaction is a Pummerer rearrangement.
# Reactants: Methyl phenyl sulfoxide, Triflic anhydride, Trimethylsilyl cyanide
# Step 1: Activation of sulfoxide by triflic anhydride.
# Step 2: Formation of a thionium ion intermediate: [C6H5-S=CH2]+
# Step 3: Nucleophilic attack by cyanide from TMSCN on the CH2 group.
# Final Product Structure: C6H5-S-CH2-CN
# IUPAC Naming:
# - Principal functional group: Nitrile (-CN)
# - Parent chain: Ethanenitrile (for a 2-carbon nitrile)
# - Substituent at position 2: Phenylthio (C6H5S-)
# The final name includes the number '2' indicating the substituent's position.
