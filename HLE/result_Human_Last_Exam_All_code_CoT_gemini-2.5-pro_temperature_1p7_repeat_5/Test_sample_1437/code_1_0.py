    Calculates the universal dimensionless numerical value for the Lindhard function
    at zero frequency and momentum transfer.

    In the static (w=0) and long-wavelength (k=0) limit, the Lindhard
    polarization function Pi(0,0) is equal to the negative of the density
    of states at the Fermi energy, -D(E_F).

    While D(E_F) itself depends on the electron density, it can be expressed
    in terms of the electron density (n) and the Fermi energy (E_F) by a
    universal relation for a 3D electron gas:
      D(E_F) = (3/2) * (n / E_F)

    Therefore, the Lindhard function is:
      Pi(0, 0) = - (3/2) * (n / E_F)

    The numerical value referred to in the problem is this universal,
    dimensionless prefactor.
