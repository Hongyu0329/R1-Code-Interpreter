# This part will not be printed to the user but determines the final answer
# - A is ruled out by the calculation.
# - B is illogical as enthalpy is normalized per mole.
# - C is physically unlikely (negative surface energy) or predicts the opposite trend (positive surface energy).
# - E is speculative and less likely than D.
# - D provides a plausible mechanism for a large endothermic contribution that increases for smaller particles.
