1. The experiment described uses a one-way door, which functions as a Brownian ratchet. Its purpose is to rectify the random motion of gas molecules to achieve a directed flow from one compartment to another.
2. The fundamental driving force behind this process is the random thermal motion of the individual gas molecules.
3. In physics, the measure of the average kinetic energy of these randomly moving molecules is Temperature. A higher temperature means more vigorous random motion, while at absolute zero (0 Kelvin), this motion ceases entirely.
4. For the one-way door to work, molecules must be moving so they can collide with and pass through the door. If there were no temperature (T=0K), the molecules would be stationary, and no gas would ever move to the other side.
5. Therefore, Temperature is the essential experimental parameter required for the system to operate and trap the gas on one side. The other factors influence the rate of the process, but temperature enables it.

    # Although there's no numerical equation to solve, the problem asks to output the thinking.
    # We can represent the core relationship conceptually.
    # Let M be the movement of gas through the door.
    # Let T be the temperature.
    # The relationship is that M is only possible if T > 0.
