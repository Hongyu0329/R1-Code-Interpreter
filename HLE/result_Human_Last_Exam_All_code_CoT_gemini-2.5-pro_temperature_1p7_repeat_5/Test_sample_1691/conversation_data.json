    "An analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$ can be found by performing an asymptotic expansion.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nFor small $\\epsilon > 0$, the value of the integral is dominated by the behavior of the integrand where the denominator is smallest. The denominator is $\\epsilon + f(x)$ where $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. The function $f(x)$ is zero at $x=0$. Therefore, the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\nFor small $x$, we can approximate $f(x)$ by its leading terms: $f(x) \\approx 9x^5 + 5x^6$. This suggests an asymptotic expansion of $I(\\epsilon)$ in fractional powers of $\\epsilon$. A detailed analysis using the method of matched asymptotic expansions shows that the expansion has the form:\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx C_1 \\epsilon^{-p_1} + C_2 \\epsilon^{-p_2} + \\dots$\n\n1.  **Leading Term:** The dominant behavior is captured by approximating $f(x) \\approx 9x^5$. This leads to an integral that can be evaluated to give the first term of the expansion. The power is determined by the power of $x$: for $x^n$, the power of $\\epsilon$ is $-(n-1)/n$. Here $n=5$, so $p_1 = 4/5$. The coefficient $C_1$ is found to be:\n    $C_1 = \\frac{\\pi / 5}{9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n2.  **First Correction Term:** The next term in the approximation comes from considering the $5x^6$ term in $f(x)$. This introduces a correction term with a new power of $\\epsilon$. This power is $p_2 = (n-2)/n$ if the correction term is of order $x^{n+1}$. In our case, this corresponds to $p_2 = (5-2)/5 = 3/5$. The coefficient $C_2$ is given by:\n    $C_2 = -\\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)}$\n\nThus, a two-term approximation for the integral is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx C_1 \\epsilon^{-4/5} + C_2 \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\n\nThe Python code below calculates the numerical values of the exponents and the coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$, and then prints the final analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coefficients for the asymptotic expansion of the integral I(epsilon)\n    and prints the analytical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The denominator polynomial is f(x) = 9*x**5 + 5*x**6 + 9*x**8\n    # For small x, the dominant term is c1*x**n1 where c1=9.0, n1=5.0\n    # The next dominant term is c2*x**n2 where c2=5.0, n2=6.0\n    n1 = 5.0\n    c1_coeff = 9.0\n    \n    # The power of epsilon in the leading term is p1 = (n1-1)/n1\n    p1 = (n1 - 1) / n1\n\n    # The coefficient of the leading term is C1 = (pi/n1) / (c1**(1/n1) * sin(pi/n1))\n    C1 = (np.pi / n1) / (c1_coeff**(1/n1) * np.sin(np.pi / n1))\n\n    # The power of epsilon in the first correction term is p2 = (n1-2)/n1\n    p2 = (n1 - 2) / n1\n    \n    # The coefficient of the first correction term can be derived as\n    # C2 = -c2 * c1**(-(n1+1)/n1) * integral(u**(n1) / (1+u**n1)**2 du)\n    # The integral evaluates to (1/n1) * Gamma((n1+1)/n1)*Gamma(1-(1/n1))\n    # which simplifies using Gamma properties.
