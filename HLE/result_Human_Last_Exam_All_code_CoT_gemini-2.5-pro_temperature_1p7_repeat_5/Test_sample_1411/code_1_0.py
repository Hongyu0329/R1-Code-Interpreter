# The watch being auctioned is the Heuer Monaco, a model made famous by Steve McQueen.
# On the standard dial of this watch (reference 1133), the date window is positioned at 6 o'clock.
# The task is to identify the text written directly above this date window.

# By examining the watch dial, we can see the model name is printed just above the date aperture.
text_on_dial = "MONACO"

# The request specifies the answer should be in all lower case.
answer = text_on_dial.lower()

# Print the final result.
