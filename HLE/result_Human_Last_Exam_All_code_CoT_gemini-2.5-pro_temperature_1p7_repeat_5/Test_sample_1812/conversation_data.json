    "Of course. Here is the plan to compute the determinant of the given adjacency matrix.\n\nFirst, I will identify the matrix from the user's request.\nThe matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nNext, I will use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n`det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n\nI will write a Python script that substitutes the values from matrix A into this formula, prints out the step-by-step calculation, and then shows the final result. For robust calculation, I will use the `numpy` library.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the given 3x3 adjacency matrix\n    and prints the step-by-step calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The matrix A is provided in the problem description.\n    # The mention of the Markov quiver and m_{1/2}=13 is context;\n    # the core task is to find the determinant of the given matrix A.\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The given adjacency matrix is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Extract elements for printing the equation clearly\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    # The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\n    # det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\n    print(\"To compute the determinant, we substitute the matrix elements into the formula.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # Print the full equation with all numbers from the matrix\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n    # Step-by-step calculation\n    term1_inner = e * i - f * h\n    term2_inner = d * i - f * g\n    term3_inner = d * h - e * g\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Calculate the terms in parentheses\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * ({term1_inner}) - ({b}) * ({term2_inner}) + ({c}) * ({term3_inner})\")\n\n    term1 = a * term1_inner\n    term2 = -b * term2_inner\n    term3 = c * term3_inner\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Perform the multiplications\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({term1}) + ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\n\n    # Final result from the step-by-step calculation\n    final_determinant = term1 + term2 + term3\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Sum the terms to get the final determinant\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {final_determinant}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Verify with numpy's determinant function\n    det_A_numpy = np.linalg.det(A)\n    print(f\"The determinant as calculated by numpy is: {det_A_numpy:.0f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    compute_determinant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
