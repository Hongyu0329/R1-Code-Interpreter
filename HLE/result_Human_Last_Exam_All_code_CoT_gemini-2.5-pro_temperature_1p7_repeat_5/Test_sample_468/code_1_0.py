    This function provides the common name for the bee genus Perdita
    and the year its usage was popularized in a major publication.

    My research indicates the following:
    - The most widely accepted common name for bees of the genus "Perdita" is "Fairy bees."
    - This name is due to their diminutive size and often vibrant, jewel-like coloration.
    - While the exact origin is hard to trace, a key publication that helped popularize
      this name for a broad audience was "The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American
      Insects and Spiders," which explicitly labels them "Fairy Bee".
    - This field guide was published in 1980.
