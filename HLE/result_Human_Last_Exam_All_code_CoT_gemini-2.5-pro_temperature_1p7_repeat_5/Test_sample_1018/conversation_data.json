    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the properties of the surfaces.**\n    The spaces are $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. These are closed, oriented surfaces of genus $g=31$ and $g=17$, respectively. Since both genera are greater than or equal to 2, these are hyperbolic surfaces. Hyperbolic surfaces are aspherical.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a single surface.**\n    For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ with genus $g \\geq 2$, its simplicial volume is given by the formula:\n    $||\\Sigma_g|| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$ is the Euler characteristic.\n    Thus, $||\\Sigma_g|| = 2|2 - 2g| = 2(2g - 2) = 4g - 4$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the simplicial volume for each surface.**\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$: $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4 \\times 31 - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$: $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4 \\times 17 - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n4.  **Recall the product formula for simplicial volume.**\n    For two closed, oriented, aspherical manifolds M and N of dimensions `m` and `n` respectively, the simplicial volume of their product is given by Gromov's product formula:\n    $||M \\times N|| = \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n    In our case, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$. The dimension of any surface is 2, so $m=2$ and $n=2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the binomial coefficient.**\n    The coefficient is $\\binom{m+n}{m} = \\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6$.\n\n6.  **Compute the final result.**\n    Substitute the values into the product formula:\n    $||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, Σ_g1 and Σ_g2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the genera of the surfaces.\n    g1 = 31\n    g2 = 17\n\n    print(f\"We are computing the simplicial volume of Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of the first surface.\n    # The formula for the simplicial volume of a hyperbolic surface (g >= 2) is ||Σ_g|| = 4g - 4.\n    if g1 >= 2:\n        sv1 = 4 * g1 - 4\n        print(f\"The simplicial volume of Σ_{g1} is ||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * {g1} - 4 = {sv1}.\")\n    else:\n        # This case is not applicable here but included for completeness.\n        sv1 = 0\n        print(f\"The simplicial volume of Σ_{g1} is 0 since g < 2.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the simplicial volume of the second surface.\n    if g2 >= 2:\n        sv2 = 4 * g2 - 4\n        print(f\"The simplicial volume of Σ_{g2} is ||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * {g2} - 4 = {sv2}.\")\n    else:\n        sv2 = 0\n        print(f\"The simplicial volume of Σ_{g2} is 0 since g < 2.\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 4: Use the product formula for simplicial volume.\n    # For aspherical manifolds M (dim m) and N (dim n), ||M x N|| = C(m+n, m) * ||M|| * ||N||.\n    # For surfaces, the dimension is 2.
