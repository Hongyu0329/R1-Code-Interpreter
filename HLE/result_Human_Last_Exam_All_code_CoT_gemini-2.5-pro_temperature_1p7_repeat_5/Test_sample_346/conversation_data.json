    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression. Then, we can calculate the base-2 logarithm of `n`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Represent SKI Combinators**: Create Python classes for the `S`, `K`, `I` combinators and for function application.\n2.  **Parse the Expression**: Write a parser to convert the input string into a nested object structure that represents the expression tree.\n3.  **Implement a Reduction Engine**: Create a function that repeatedly applies the fundamental reduction rules of SKI calculus (`Sxyz -> xz(yz)`, `Kxy -> x`, `Ix -> x`) to simplify the expression to its normal form. This process is purely mechanical and avoids the pitfalls of interpretative manual simplification.\n4.  **Determine the Integer Value**: A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes two arguments, `f` and `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. To find `n`, we will apply our parsed combinator to two symbolic variables, `f` and `x`, and reduce the resulting expression. The simplified expression will be of the form `f(f(...(f(x))...))`. We can then count the number of applications of `f` to find the integer `n`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Once `n` is known, use Python's `math` library to compute `log_2(n)`.\n6.  **Output**: Print the intermediate result `n` and the final equation as requested.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\n# Increase recursion limit for potentially complex reductions.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2500)\n\n# --- Step 1: Represent SKI Combinators ---\n\nclass S:\n    \"\"\"The S combinator: Sxyz = xz(yz)\"\"\"\n    def __repr__(self): return \"S\"\n\nclass K:\n    \"\"\"The K combinator: Kxy = x\"\"\"\n    def __repr__(self): return \"K\"\n\nclass I:\n    \"\"\"The I combinator: Ix = x\"\"\"\n    def __repr__(self): return \"I\"\n\nclass App:\n    \"\"\"Represents the application of a function to an argument, e.g., f(x)\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, func, arg):\n        self.func = func\n        self.arg = arg\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"({self.func} {self.arg})\"\n\n# --- Step 2: Parse the Expression ---\n\ndef parse_ski(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a string in S(A)(B) format into a nested expression tree.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []\n    i = 0\n    s_len = len(s)\n    while i < s_len:\n        char = s[i]\n        if char in \"SKI\":\n            if char == 'S': stack.append(S())\n            elif char == 'K': stack.append(K())\n            elif char == 'I': stack.append(I())\n            i += 1\n        elif char == '(':\n            open_paren = 1\n            j = i + 1\n            while j < s_len:\n                if s[j] == '(': open_paren += 1\n                elif s[j] == ')': open_paren -= 1\n                if open_paren == 0: break\n                j += 1\n            \n            arg_str = s[i+1:j]\n            arg_expr = parse_ski(arg_str)\n            \n            if not stack:\n                stack.append(arg_expr)\n            else:\n                func = stack.pop()\n                stack.append(App(func, arg_expr))\n            i = j + 1\n        else: #
