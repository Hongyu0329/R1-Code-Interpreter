# The task is to identify the correct statement for isolating a fibroblast cell line.
# Based on standard biological protocols, statement C is the most accurate.
# This script will outline the components of the culture medium mentioned in statement C.

# Concentration of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) in the medium
fbs_percentage = 10

# Concentration of antibiotic solution in the medium
antibiotic_percentage = 1

# The statement describes isolating stromal cells after removing the epithelium and endothelium.
# These cells are then cultured, causing them to adhere, proliferate, and differentiate.
# The final composition of the growth medium is key to this process.

print("To successfully culture the corneal fibroblast cell line, the growth medium was composed as follows:")
print("Final Medium = Basal Medium + FBS + Antibiotics")
print("The final equation for the enriched components is:")
# The final line below prints out each number in the final equation as requested.
print(f"Enrichment = {fbs_percentage}% FBS + {antibiotic_percentage}% Antibiotics")
