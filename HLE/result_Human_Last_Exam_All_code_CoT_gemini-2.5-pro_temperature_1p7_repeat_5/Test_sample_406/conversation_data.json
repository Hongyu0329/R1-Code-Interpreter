    "Of course, I can help with that. This question pertains to a domain of mathematics called fixed-point theory. The conditions for the existence of such a point can be established using a generalization of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to product spaces.\n\nHere is my plan to explain the conditions and provide a Python script to illustrate them:\n1.  **Define the FGH-tripled Fixed Point**: First, I will clarify what an FGH-tripled fixed point is based on the function signatures provided.\n2.  **Introduce the Theoretical Framework**: I'll explain the core idea, which involves defining an operator on the product space `X × Y × Z` and showing that it is a contraction mapping. This guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point.\n3.  **State the Conditions**: I will detail the specific conditions that the functions F, G, and H must satisfy. This involves them being Lipschitz-type mappings with certain coefficients.\n4.  **Derive the Main Inequality**: I'll show how the individual conditions on F, G, and H combine into a single condition for the operator on the product space to be a contraction.\n5.  **Provide a Python Script**: The script will not compute a result but will programmatically print out these theoretical conditions and then demonstrate them with a concrete numerical example, showing the calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python script that outlines and demonstrates the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and demonstrates the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Definition of the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point ---\n    print(\"--- FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Definition ---\")\n    print(\"Let X, Y, and Z be non-empty sets and let F, G, H be the following functions:\")\n    print(\"F: X × Y × Z → X\")\n    print(\"G: Y × X × Y → Y\")\n    print(\"H: Z × Y × X → Z\\n\")\n    print(\"A point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the system of equations:\")\n    print(\"F(x, y, z) = x\")\n    print(\"G(y, x, y) = y\")\n    print(\"H(z, y, x) = z\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness ---\n    print(\"--- Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness ---\")\n    print(\"The existence and uniqueness of such a point can be guaranteed by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to the product space M = X × Y × Z.\")\n    print(\"The conditions are:\\n\")\n    print(\"Condition 1: The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Condition 2: The functions F, G, and H must satisfy the following contractive (Lipschitz-like) inequalities for all x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\")\n    print(\"There exist non-negative constants (f_x, f_y, f_z, g_x, g_y, h_x, h_y, h_z) such that:\\n\")\n    print(\"a) d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ f_x*d_X(x₁, x₂) + f_y*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + f_z*d_Z(z₁, z₂)\")\n    print(\"b) d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ g_x*d_X(x₁, x₂) + g_y*d_Y(y₁, y₂)\")\n    print(\"c) d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ h_x*d_X(x₁, x₂) + h_y*d_Y(y₁, y₂) + h_z*d_Z(z₁, z₂)\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: The Main Contraction Inequality ---\n    print(\"--- Main Contraction Inequality ---\")\n    print(\"By defining an operator T(x, y, z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x)) on the product space,\")\n    print(\"T is a contraction mapping if the sum of the coefficients for each dimension is less than 1.\")\n    print(\"Let:\")\n    print(\"k_x = f_x + g_x + h_x\")\n    print(\"k_y = f_y + g_y + h_y\")\n    print(\"k_z = f_z + h_z\\n\")\n    print(\"The final condition is that the maximum of these sums must be strictly less than 1:\")\n    print(\"max(k_x, k_y, k_z) < 1\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Numerical Example ---\n    print(\"--- Numerical Example ---\")\n    print(\"Let's assume the following values for the constants:\")\n    # Assign example values\n    f_x, f_y, f_z = 0.2, 0.1, 0.3\n    g_x, g_y = 0.15, 0.25\n    h_x, h_y, h_z = 0.1, 0.2, 0.2\n\n    print(f\"f_x = {f_x}, f_y = {f_y}, f_z = {f_z}\")\n    print(f\"g_x = {g_x}, g_y = {g_y}\")\n    print(f\"h_x = {h_x}, h_y = {h_y}, h_z = {h_z}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate k_x, k_y, k_z\n    k_x = f_x + g_x + h_x\n    k_y = f_y + g_y + h_y\n    k_z = f_z + h_z\n\n    print(\"Now, we calculate the sums k_x, k_y, k_z:\")\n    print(f\"k_x = {f_x} + {g_x} + {h_x} = {k_x}\")\n    print(f\"k_y = {f_y} + {g_y} + {h_y} = {k_y}\")\n    print(f\"k_z = {f_z} + {h_z} = {k_z}\\n\")\n\n    # Check the final condition\n    k = max(k_x, k_y, k_z)\n\n    print(\"Finally, we find the maximum value, k, and check if it is less than 1:\")\n    print(f\"k = max({k_x}, {k_y}, {k_z}) = {k}\")\n\n    if k < 1:\n        print(f\"Since k = {k} is less than 1, the conditions are satisfied.\")\n        print(\"Therefore, F, G, and H have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Since k = {k} is not less than 1, these coefficients do not guarantee a tripled fixed point.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n\n```\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) exists and is unique if (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), (Z, d_Z) are complete metric spaces and there exist non-negative constants such that `max(f_x + g_x + h_x, f_y + g_y + h_y, f_z + h_z) < 1`, where these constants are the Lipschitz coefficients for the functions F, G, and H as detailed in the script's explanation.>>>"
