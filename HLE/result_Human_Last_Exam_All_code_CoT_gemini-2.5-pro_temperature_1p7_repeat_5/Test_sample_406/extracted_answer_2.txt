An FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) exists and is unique if (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), (Z, d_Z) are complete metric spaces and there exist non-negative constants such that `max(f_x + g_x + h_x, f_y + g_y + h_y, f_z + h_z) < 1`, where these constants are the Lipschitz coefficients for the functions F, G, and H as detailed in the script's explanation.
