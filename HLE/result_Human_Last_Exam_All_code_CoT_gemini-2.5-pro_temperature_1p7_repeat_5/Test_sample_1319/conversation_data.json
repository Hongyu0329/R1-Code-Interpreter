    "Here is a plan to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, besides Mount Olympus:\n\n1.  First, I will create a list of the prominent historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus. These are Mount Athos, Mount Ida (the one near Troy), Mount Pelion, and Mount Samothrace.\n2.  Next, I will find the modern-day elevations for each of these mountains.\n3.  I will then write a Python script to store these mountains and their elevations in a dictionary.\n4.  The script will iterate through the dictionary to identify the mountain with the highest elevation.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the name and elevation of the tallest mountain found, along with a comparison of the others.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad,\n    other than Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of mountains from the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    # Mount Olympus (2917m) is excluded as per the request.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ida\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611\n    }\n\n    # Find the tallest mountain by finding the maximum value in the dictionary.\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_elevation = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    # Print the final answer and the comparison.\n    print(f\"After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Its elevation is {tallest_mountain_elevation} meters.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nElevation Comparison:\")\n    # Sort mountains by elevation in descending order for clear comparison.\n    for name, elevation in sorted(mountains.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True):\n        print(f\"- {name}: {elevation} m\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
