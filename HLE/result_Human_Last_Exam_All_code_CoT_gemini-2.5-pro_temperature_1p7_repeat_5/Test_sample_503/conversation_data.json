    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ (viewed as a 2-category) from an object $[n]$ to an object $[m]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$, such that $f$ is the left adjoint to $g$. This relationship, denoted $f \\dashv g$, is defined by the condition:\n$f(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le g(y)$ for all $x \\in [n]$ and $y \\in [m]$.\n\nThis problem asks for the number of such adjunctions for $n=23$ and $m=37$. The task is to count the number of pairs of maps $(f, g)$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nAn adjunction is determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Let's focus on the left adjoint $f: [n] \\to [m]$.\nA monotone map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it has a right adjoint. A right adjoint $g$ can be constructed from $f$ using the formula $g(y) = \\max\\{x \\in [n] \\mid f(x) \\le y\\}$. For $g(y)$ to be well-defined for every $y \\in [m]$, the set $\\{x \\in [n] \\mid f(x) \\le y\\}$ must be non-empty. This must hold for all $y \\in [m]$, including $y=0$.\nFor $y=0$, we require the existence of an $x \\in [n]$ such that $f(x) \\le 0$. Since the codomain of $f$ is $[m]=\\{0, 1, ..., m\\}$, this means $f(x)=0$. As $f$ is order-preserving, if it takes the value 0, it must do so at $x=0$. So, we must have $f(0)=0$.\nThis condition is also sufficient. If $f(0)=0$, then for any $y \\in [m]$, we have $f(0) \\le y$, so the set is never empty.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ that satisfy the condition $f(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a sequence of integers $(f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(n))$ such that $0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(n) \\le m$.\nThe additional constraint $f(0)=0$ simplifies this to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences of length $n$ of the form $(f(1), \\dots, f(n))$ where each element is chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$.\nThe number of such sequences is a classic combinatorial problem, which can be solved using stars and bars. The formula for this count is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m+n}{n}$.\n\nFor the given values $n=23$ and $m=37$, the number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category Delta\n    from [n] to [m].\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 23\n    m = 37\n    \n    # The number of such adjunctions corresponds to the number of monotone maps\n    # f: [n] -> [m] such that f(0) = 0.\n    # This is equivalent to counting non-decreasing sequences of length n,\n    # f(1), ..., f(n), where each element is in {0, ..., m}.\n    # The formula for this is C(m+n, n).\n    \n    total = n + m\n    \n    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n+m, n)\n    result = math.comb(total, n)\n    \n    print(f\"The number of internal adjunctions from [{n}] to [{m}] is given by the binomial coefficient C({m}+{n}, {n}).\")\n    print(f\"C({total}, {n}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<46376885330421240>>>"
