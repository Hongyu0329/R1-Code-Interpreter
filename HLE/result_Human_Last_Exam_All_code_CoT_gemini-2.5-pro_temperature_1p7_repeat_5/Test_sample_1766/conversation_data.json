    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:** For a **p-electron**, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`, and the spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number `j` is obtained by coupling `l` and `s`. According to the rules of angular momentum addition, `j` can take values from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues for J²:** For each value of `j`, the eigenvalue of the $J^2$ operator is given by the formula `j(j+1)ħ²`. We will calculate this for each possible `j`.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues for Jz:** For each `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps. The corresponding eigenvalue of the $J_z$ operator is `m_jħ`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the results in a clear format, showing the final equations with the calculated numbers, as requested. For precision with half-integers, I will use Python's `Fraction` object.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve for the eigenvalues:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_p_electron_eigenvalues():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n\n    A p-electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 and\n    spin quantum number s=1/2.
