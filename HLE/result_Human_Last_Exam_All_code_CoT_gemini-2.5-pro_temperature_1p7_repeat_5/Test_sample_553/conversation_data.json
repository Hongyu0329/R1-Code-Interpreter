    "This is a music theory question that requires knowledge of The Beatles' discography. A script cannot analyze music on its own, but I can use a Python script to provide the answer and the explanation.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the musical concept in the question: a progression from a tonic chord (I) to a minor fifth chord (v). This is an unusual harmonic choice, as the fifth chord is typically major in most popular music.\n2.  Access my knowledge base of The Beatles' music to find a song that features this specific chord progression.\n3.  The song \"Michelle\" is the most famous example of this. In the key of F major, it uses a C minor chord instead of the expected C major chord.\n4.  I will write a Python script that prints the name of the song and a brief explanation of why it fits the description.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the Beatles song that fits the user's musical description.\n    This is a knowledge-based task, so the information is stored directly in the code.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The Beatles song that features a prominent chord jump from the tonic to a minor fifth chord is 'Michelle'.\\n\\n\"\n        \"The musical term for this is called modal interchange. The song is in the key of F. \"\n        \"The 'tonic' chord is F major.\\n\"\n        \"The standard 'fifth' chord should be C major.\\n\"\n        \"However, in the section with the lyrics 'I want you, I want you, I want you...', \"\n        \"the progression moves from the tonic F major to a C minor chord (the minor fifth), \"\n        \"which creates its distinctive and melancholy sound.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The song is: {song_title}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Explanation ---\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
