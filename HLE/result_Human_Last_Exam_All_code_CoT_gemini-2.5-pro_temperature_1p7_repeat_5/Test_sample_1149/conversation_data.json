    "Based on the scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, I will write a Python script to provide the number of depressions found in its lacrimal recess. The script will use variables to represent the depressions and then sum them to get the total, displaying the simple equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# The scientific paper \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\"\n# by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002) provides a detailed description of the skull.\n# In the description of the lacrimal bone, it states:\n# \"The lacrimal recess itself contains two large, deep, subsidiary depressions, one placed behind the other.\"\n\n# We can represent these two depressions with variables.\nfirst_depression = 1\nsecond_depression = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions.\ntotal_depressions = first_depression + second_depression\n\n# Print the final answer in a descriptive sentence, showing the components of the total.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {first_depression} + {second_depression} = {total_depressions} depressions.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
