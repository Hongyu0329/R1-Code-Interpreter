# The scientific paper "Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil"
# by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002) provides a detailed description of the skull.
# In the description of the lacrimal bone, it states:
# "The lacrimal recess itself contains two large, deep, subsidiary depressions, one placed behind the other."

# We can represent these two depressions with variables.
first_depression = 1
second_depression = 1

# Calculate the total number of depressions.
total_depressions = first_depression + second_depression

# Print the final answer in a descriptive sentence, showing the components of the total.
print(f"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {first_depression} + {second_depression} = {total_depressions} depressions.")
