    "To solve this, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to identify the musical note that corresponds to the range between two colors on Newton's color circle:\n    *   **Start of range:** The color resulting from mixing yellow and blue. In pigment mixing, this is green.\n    *   **End of range:** The color blue.\n\n2.  **Recall Newton's Color Circle:** Isaac Newton famously mapped the seven colors of the visible light spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) to the seven notes of a musical scale. While the exact key can vary in modern interpretations, his original work is most closely associated with a minor scale starting on D. In this system, the notes mark the boundaries between the color segments.\n\n3.  **Establish the Mapping:** The mapping based on Newton's work is as follows:\n    *   The arc for **Red** ends at note **D**.\n    *   The arc for **Orange** is between **D** and **E**.\n    *   The arc for **Yellow** is between **E** and **F**.\n    *   The arc for **Green** is between **F** and **G**.\n    *   The arc for **Blue** is between **G** and **A**.\n    *   The arc for **Indigo** is between **A** and **B**.\n    *   The arc for **Violet** is between **B** and the next **C**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Note:** The question asks for the note for the \"range between\" green and blue. Looking at the mapping, the color green occupies the segment that ends at the note **G**, and the color blue occupies the segment that begins at **G**. Therefore, the boundary note that separates green from blue is **G**.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Creates a dictionary to store Newton's color-to-note mapping.\n    *   Identifies that yellow and blue combine to make green.\n    *   Looks up the boundary note associated with green.\n    *   Prints a clear explanation of the logic and the resulting note.\n\n```python\ndef find_newtonian_note():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the musical note corresponding to the boundary between green and blue\n    on Newton's color circle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Newton's mapping of colors to the notes that mark the end of their respective\n    # segments on his color circle. This is based on the Dorian mode or a minor\n    # scale starting on D, which is most commonly attributed to his original work.\n    newton_color_music_map = {\n        \"Red\": \"D\",\n        \"Orange\": \"E\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"F\",\n        \"Green\": \"G\",\n        \"Blue\": \"A\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"B\",\n        \"Violet\": \"C\"\n    }\n\n    # 1. Identify the colors from the user's question.\n    # The first color is the result of combining yellow and blue, which is green.\n    color1 = \"Green\"\n    color2 = \"Blue\"\n\n    # 2. Find the note corresponding to the boundary between these two colors.\n    # In Newton's system, the note for a color marks the boundary at the end of\n    # its segment. The green segment ends at 'G', where the blue segment begins.\n    boundary_note = newton_color_music_map[color1]\n\n    # 3.
