    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of the BDF4 method, we need to analyze its region of absolute stability.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Stability Polynomial:** The stability of a linear multistep method applied to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$ is determined by its characteristic polynomials $\\rho(z)$ and $\\sigma(z)$. The boundary of the stability region is given by the values $\\hat{h} = h\\lambda = \\rho(e^{i\\theta}) / \\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. For BDF4, these polynomials are:\n    *   $\\rho(z) = \\frac{25}{12}z^4 - 4z^3 + 3z^2 - \\frac{4}{3}z + \\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   $\\sigma(z) = z^4$\n    This gives the boundary curve:\n    $\\hat{h}(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4e^{-i\\theta} + 3e^{-i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{-i3\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i4\\theta}$.\n\n2.  **$A(\\alpha)$-stability Angle:** The angle $\\alpha$ is the half-angle of the largest sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$ that is contained within the stability region. This angle is determined by the ray from the origin that is tangent to the stability boundary.\n\n3.  **Tangency Condition:** Let $\\hat{h}(\\theta) = R(\\theta) + iI(\\theta)$ be the parametrization of the boundary. The condition for a tangent from the origin is that the position vector $\\hat{h}$ is parallel to the tangent vector $\\hat{h}'(\\theta)$. In terms of the real and imaginary parts, this is $R(\\theta)I'(\\theta) - I(\\theta)R'(\\theta) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Angle:** By substituting $c = \\cos(\\theta)$, this tangency condition can be expressed as a polynomial equation in $c$. The roots of this polynomial give the points of tangency. We are looking for the root that defines the stability angle, which from literature is known to be approximately $73.3^\\circ$. For a specific root $c_0$, the angle $\\alpha$ is given by $\\tan(\\alpha) = |I(\\theta_0)/R(\\theta_0)|$.\n\n5.  **Implementation:** The following Python code uses the `numpy` library to define the polynomials derived from the tangency condition and find the relevant root. It then calculates the value of $\\tan^2(\\alpha)$ and prints the final equation for $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bdf4_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the exact value for the A(alpha)-stability angle of BDF4.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The tangency condition leads to a polynomial equation in c = cos(theta).\n    # After factorization, one of the factors that gives the tangency points is\n    # 12*c^2 - 8*c - 3 = 0.\n    tangency_poly_factor = np.poly1d([12, -8, -3])\n    roots = tangency_poly_factor.roots\n    \n    # According to the literature on BDF methods, the stability angle \n    # alpha (approx 73.3 degrees) corresponds to the negative root.\n    c0 = min(roots)\n    \n    # We define the real and imaginary parts of the stability function h_hat\n    # in terms of polynomials in c.\n    # R(c) = (2/3) * P_R(c), with P_R(c) = 3c^4 - 8c^3 + 6c^2 - 1\n    # I(c) = (s/3) * P_I(c), with P_I(c) = -6c^3 + 16c^2 - 15c + 8 and s=sqrt(1-c^2)\n    P_R = np.poly1d([3, -8, 6, 0, -1])\n    P_I = np.poly1d([-6, 16, -15, 8])\n\n    # The tangent squared of the angle alpha is given by I(c0)^2 / R(c0)^2\n    s2 = 1 - c0**2\n    R_val = (2./3.) * P_R(c0)\n    I_val = (np.sqrt(s2)/3.) * P_I(c0)\n    \n    tan2_alpha = (I_val**2) / (R_val**2)\n\n    # The exact form of tan^2(alpha) is complex.\n    # Let's derive a simpler expression by reducing the polynomials.\n    # We use the fact that 12c^2 - 8c - 3 = 0 at the root c0.\n    q_PR, r_PR = np.polydiv(P_R, tangency_poly_factor)\n    q_PI, r_PI = np.polydiv(P_I, tangency_poly_factor)\n\n    # At the root c0, the polynomials are equal to their remainders.\n    R_rem_val = (2./3.) * np.polyval(r_PR, c0)\n    I_rem_val = (np.sqrt(s2)/3.) * np.polyval(r_PI, c0)\n\n    tan2_alpha_rem = (I_rem_val**2) / (R_rem_val**2)\n    \n    # Print the equation for alpha.
