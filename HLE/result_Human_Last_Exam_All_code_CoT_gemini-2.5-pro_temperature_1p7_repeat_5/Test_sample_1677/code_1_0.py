    # Explanation A: The decrease in the 18-year-old population was smaller than predicted.
    # Analysis: This is factually incorrect. The 18-year-old population in Japan peaked at around 2.05 million in 1992
    # and fell sharply to about 1.06 million by 2023. The predictions of a rapid demographic decline were accurate.
    # Therefore, the claim that the decline was "smaller than predicted" is false.
    is_A_incorrect = True
    reasoning_A = "Option A is incorrect. Demographic data shows the 18-year-old population declined sharply, as predicted, not less than predicted."

    # Explanation B: Increase in university enrollment rate.
    # Analysis: This is correct. The university advancement rate (including junior colleges) has risen dramatically,
    # from around 30-40% in the early 1990s to over 60% in the 2020s. This is a primary factor offsetting the population decline.
    is_B_incorrect = False
    reasoning_B = "Option B is correct. The university enrollment rate has significantly increased and is a major reason for the trend."

    # Explanation C: Increased demand for re-learning by working adults.
    # Analysis: While this trend exists and is encouraged, its scale is not large enough to be a primary driver
    # for the overall increase in the total number of university entrants when compared to the hundreds of thousands of high school graduates enrolling each year.
    # It's a minor contributing factor, not a main explanation, making it potentially inappropriate in terms of scale, but less definitively wrong than other options.
    is_C_incorrect = False # Not as incorrect as A or D
    reasoning_C = "Option C describes a real but minor trend. Its impact is not significant enough to be a primary explanation."

    # Explanation D: Diversification of higher education (acting as prep schools).
    # Analysis: This is an inappropriate characterization. Specialized training colleges (senmon gakkou) and two-year colleges
    # are primarily for vocational training and direct employment. While transfers to 4-year universities exist, it's not their main purpose
    # or a large-scale phenomenon that would explain the overall rise in university entrants.
    is_D_incorrect = True
    reasoning_D = "Option D is inappropriate. It misrepresents the primary role of specialized and two-year colleges, which is vocational training, not university preparation."

    # Explanation E: Government policies.
    # Analysis: This is correct. The government's deregulation of university establishment standards (大学設置基準の緩和) in the 1990s
    # and subsidies for private universities directly enabled the number of universities and available slots to grow.
    is_E_incorrect = False
    reasoning_E = "Option E is correct. Government deregulation and subsidies were key policies that facilitated the growth in universities."
