# The task is to count the number of formal "pas de Balanchine" steps
# in a specific ballet solo.

# Based on choreographic analysis of William Forsythe's work, while the style is
# heavily influenced by Balanchine, the Jete Woman solo does not contain any
# formal, textbook "pas de Balanchine" steps. The movements are a deconstruction
# and evolution of the style, not a direct quotation of the step.
observed_pas_de_balanchine = 0

# The final count is therefore the number observed.
final_count = observed_pas_de_balanchine

# Print the final equation as requested.
# The equation shows the single number involved in this count.
print(f"Equation: Total 'pas de Balanchine' observed = {observed_pas_de_balanchine}")

# Print the final answer.
print(f"In the Jete Woman solo scene, Svetlana Gileva performed {final_count} formal pas de Balanchines.")
