    Step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of homeomorphism classes:

    1.  The problem describes a compact topological space X with two properties related to the long ray, R = [0, \omega_1).

    2.  Property (1) states that X contains a dense copy of R. This identifies X as a compactification of R.

    3.  Property (2) states that every bounded continuous function f from R to the real numbers extends to a unique continuous function on X.

    4.  These two properties are the defining characteristics of the Stone-Čech compactification, denoted as βR. The long ray R is a Tychonoff space, so its Stone-Čech compactification exists and is well-defined.

    5.  A key theorem in topology states that the Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space is unique up to a homeomorphism that is the identity on the original space.

    6.  This means that any space X satisfying the given properties must be homeomorphic to βR.

    7.  Since all such spaces are homeomorphic to βR, they are all homeomorphic to each other. Therefore, they all belong to the same homeomorphism class.

    8.  Conclusion: There is only one such homeomorphism class.
