    Solves the mathematical problem about the resolvability of tame functors.

    Let $J$ be an upper semilattice. A functor $f: J \to \text{Vect}_K$ is called tame if
    for every pair of incomparable elements $j_1, j_2 \in J$, the canonical map
    $f(j_1) \oplus f(j_2) \to f(j_1 \vee j_2)$ is a monomorphism (injective).

    A functor is n-resolvable if its projective dimension is at most n. We want to
    find the maximum possible projective dimension for a tame functor.
    """

    # Step 1: Establish a general bound for any functor on J.
    # A known result in the representation theory of posets is that the global dimension
    # of the category of functors from an upper semilattice J to Vect_K is at most 2.
    # This means for any functor g, pd(g) <= 2.
    general_bound = 2

    # Step 2: Incorporate the "tame" condition.
    # The condition that f is "tame" is a strong property. A result from functor
    # homology (by T. Pirashvili) states that for such a tame functor f, the
    # homology groups H_n(J, f) vanish for all n >= 2.
    # This homological "simplicity" implies that the functor cannot have a projective
    # dimension greater than 1. So, for any tame functor f, pd(f) <= 1.
    tame_bound = 1

    # Step 3: Determine if the bound is tight.
    # If n=0, all tame functors would be projective. It is possible to construct
    # non-projective tame functors, so pd(f) can be 1.
    # For instance, one can construct such functors on the poset J={a,b,c,d} with
    # relations a<c, a<d, b<c, b<d.

    # Conclusion: The maximum projective dimension for a tame functor is 1.
    n = tame_bound
