    "This is a clever riddle that combines a literary reference with a descriptive clue. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The riddle has three parts:\n    *   A quote source: \"As Kurt Vonnegut noted...\"\n    *   A description: \"...this man looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.\"\n    *   A name format: \"...two words that start with the same letter.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Reference:** Kurt Vonnegut's quote about a man looking like a \"porcupine\" appears in his novel *Slaughterhouse-Five*, and it refers to the composer Johannes Brahms. However, \"Johannes Brahms\" does not have two words starting with the same letter.\n\n3.  **Solve the Riddle:** The reference to Brahms is a contextual clue. It points us toward German artists who were influential on Vonnegut and his work. The answer must fit the other two criteria: an alliterative name and a \"porcupine-like\" appearance (i.e., unruly or spiky hair). The German playwright **Bertolt Brecht** fits perfectly:\n    *   His name is alliterative (B.B.).\n    *   He often had wild, spiky hair in photographs.\n    *   He was a major influence on Vonnegut's writing style, especially the \"epic theater\" techniques used in *Slaughterhouse-Five*.\n\nThe script below will declare the first and last names and then print the full solution.\n\n```python\n# The riddle points to a person associated with Kurt Vonnegut.\n# The clue \"looks like a porcupine\" refers to unruly, spiky hair.\n# The name must be alliterative (two words starting with the same letter).\n# While Vonnegut's quote was about Johannes Brahms, the riddle's answer is another\n# influential German artist who fits all the criteria: Bertolt Brecht.\n\nfirst_name = \"Bertolt\"\nlast_name = \"Brecht\"\n\n# We print the final answer to the user.\nprint(f\"The man's name is: {first_name} {last_name}\")\n```\n<<<Bertolt Brecht>>>"
