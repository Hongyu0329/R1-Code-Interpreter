# The riddle points to a person associated with Kurt Vonnegut.
# The clue "looks like a porcupine" refers to unruly, spiky hair.
# The name must be alliterative (two words starting with the same letter).
# While Vonnegut's quote was about Johannes Brahms, the riddle's answer is another
# influential German artist who fits all the criteria: Bertolt Brecht.

first_name = "Bertolt"
last_name = "Brecht"
