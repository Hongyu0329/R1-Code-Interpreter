    "My plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881 is as follows:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization**: I will implement a standard prime factorization algorithm.\n2.  **Handle the factor of 2**: First, I will repeatedly divide the number by 2 until it's odd.\n3.  **Iterate through odd divisors**: Next, I will iterate through odd numbers (3, 5, 7, ...) starting from 3, up to the square root of the remaining number. For each odd number `i` that divides the number, I'll divide the number by `i` repeatedly.\n4.  **The last remaining number**: After the loop, if the number that's left is greater than 2, this remaining number must be a prime factor itself.\n5.  **Identify the largest factor**: During this process, I will keep track of all the prime factors found. The largest one among them is the answer. If the original number is prime, it will be its own largest prime divisor.\n6.  **Format the output**: The final code will print the factorization equation (e.g., `factor1 * factor2 = number`) and then print the largest prime factor on a new line.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_and_print_largest_prime_divisor(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds all prime factors of a given number,\n    prints the factorization equation, and then prints the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = number\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Handle the factor of 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n        \n    # Handle odd factors\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of n\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n        i = i + 2\n        \n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2, it's the last factor\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # If the original number was prime and > 2\n    if not factors:\n        factors.append(number)\n        \n    # Print the equation showing the prime factorization\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(map(str, factors)) + f\" = {number}\"\n    print(equation_str)\n    \n    # Find and print the largest prime factor\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor of {number} is:\")\n        print(largest_prime)\n    else:\n        # This case should not be reached for numbers > 1\n        print(f\"Could not find prime factors for {number}\")\n\n# The number to be analyzed\nnum_to_factor = 8139881\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_and_print_largest_prime_divisor(num_to_factor)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
