    "Of course. This is a knowledge-based question about ballet technique. I will use a Python script to outline the defining characteristics of a *cambré derrière* in both the Vaganova and Balanchine methods to determine the most accurate answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the characteristics of a Vaganova *cambré derrière*.\n2.  Define the characteristics of a Balanchine *cambré derrière*.\n3.  Compare these characteristics against the provided options.\n4.  The Python script will print this comparison, highlighting the most significant difference, and state the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_cambre_derriere():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and prints the key differences between a cambré derrière\n    in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods of ballet.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the core principles for each method's cambré derrière.\n    vaganova_details = {\n        'Method': 'Vaganova',\n        'Head Placement': 'The head follows the line of the arm, with the eyeline extending out over the hand.
