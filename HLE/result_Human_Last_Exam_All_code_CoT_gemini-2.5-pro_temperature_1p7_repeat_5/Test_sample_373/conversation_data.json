    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Barbell Graph Structure:** I will first define the structure of a barbell graph with 10 nodes. This graph is composed of two identical complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge, which is the \"bottleneck\". With 10 nodes total, each complete graph must have 5 nodes (K5).\n2.  **Model the Gossiping Process:** I will use the standard model for randomized uniform gossiping. In this model, the process for one round of communication is:\n    *   First, a node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph.\n    *   Second, that selected node chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to communicate with.\n3.  **Identify Key Nodes:** The \"bottleneck edge\" connects two specific nodes. I will calculate the degree (number of neighbors) for these two nodes.\n    *   A node connected to the bottleneck has `(m-1)` connections within its own clique (where `m=5`) and 1 connection via the bottleneck edge.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of probabilities of two distinct events:\n    *   Event A: The node on one side of the bottleneck is chosen and it contacts its neighbor across the bottleneck.\n    *   Event B: The node on the other side is chosen and it contacts its neighbor across the bottleneck.\n5.  **Construct the Final Equation:** I will combine these probabilities into a final equation and calculate the result, printing out each number used in the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    10-node barbell graph during uniform randomized gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two K5 complete graphs\n    # connected by a single edge.\n    clique_size = 5\n\n    # Let the bottleneck edge connect node 'u' and node 'v'.\n    # Calculate the degree of the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    # Each node is connected to (clique_size - 1) other nodes in its clique,\n    # plus 1 connection via the bottleneck edge.\n    degree_of_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # Probability is calculated based on the two-step gossiping model:\n    # 1.
