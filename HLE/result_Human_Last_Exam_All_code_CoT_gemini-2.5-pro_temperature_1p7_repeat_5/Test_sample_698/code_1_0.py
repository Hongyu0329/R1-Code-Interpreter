# Description: This script analyzes the options for a Word Avalanche puzzle.
# It identifies the best choice by checking two conditions:
# 1. It must be a "True Avalanche" with repeating syllables based on the word "computer".
# 2. It must match the description: "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."

    # Analysis:
    # Option B is the only one that satisfies both conditions.
    # 1. Avalanche Quality: The syllables in "Computer" (kuhm-pyoo-ter) are phonetically
    #    repeated in "Come poo, tern!" (kuhm-poo-tern).
    # 2. Description Match: The "Computer" (software) is telling a "tern" (a bird)
    #    to "poo" (relieve itself). This perfectly matches the description.
    # Other options fail one or both conditions. For example, D is a good avalanche but
    # doesn't match the description, while C matches the description's theme but is a poor avalanche.

    explanation = "Option B is the correct answer because 'Come poo, tern!' is a strong phonetic pun on 'Computer' and the phrase describes a computer telling a bird to relieve itself, which matches the prompt."
