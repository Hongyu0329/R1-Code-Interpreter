    # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    # G acts quasiprimitively on the face set F. N = soc(G) is a non-trivial normal subgroup.
    # By definition of quasiprimitive action, N is transitive on F.
    # The faces of the quotient D_N are the N-orbits of F.
    # Transitivity of N implies there is only one orbit, so D_N is unicellular.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group
    # of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
    # A smooth covering of a unicellular dessin D_N implies that Aut(D_N) = G/N must be a cyclic group.
    # For type HA, G/N can be cyclic.
    # For type TW, G/N is Z_l, which is cyclic.
    # For type AS (for the given family), G/N is a subgroup of a cyclic group, hence cyclic.
    # All three types are possible.
    answer_b = "HA, TW, AS"

    # Part (c): True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
    # A counterexample disproves this universal claim. Consider T = A_5 and l = 2.
    # G = A_5 wr Z_2 is the known automorphism group of a regular map of type (4, 10, 2).
    # Here, face length k=2 and index l=2, so k=l.
    # The quotient G/N = Z_2 is a (4, 10, 2)-group.
    # Since a counterexample exists, the statement is false.
