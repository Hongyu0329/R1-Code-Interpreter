    "Of course. To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in `ϕ^4` theory near four dimensions, we need to find the non-trivial zero of the theory's beta function.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function**: The evolution of a coupling constant with the energy scale is described by its beta function, `β(u)`. For the `ϕ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the coupling `u` is `β(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u²`.\n2.  **Define the Fixed Point**: A fixed point, denoted `u*`, is a value of the coupling at which the scaling behavior ceases, meaning the beta function is zero: `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for the Fixed Point**: We will set the beta function to zero and solve the resulting equation for `u*`. This will give us the expression for the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is accurate to the leading order in `ϵ`.\n\nThe following Python code will print the steps of the calculation and the final expression for `u*`, detailing each component of the formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in ϕ^4 theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
