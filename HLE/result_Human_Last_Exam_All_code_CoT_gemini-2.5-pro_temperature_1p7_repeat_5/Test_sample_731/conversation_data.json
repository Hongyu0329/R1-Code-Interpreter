    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In the general form $SD_{2^n}$, this means $2^n = 512$, so $n=9$. The group has a presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element (e.g., $\\langle g \\rangle$ for some element $g$). Our task is to count all the distinct cyclic subgroups of $SD_{512}$.\n3.  **Categorize Elements:** The elements of $SD_{512}$ can be divided into two categories:\n    *   Those within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$, which has order 256.\n    *   Those of the form $sr^i$ for $i=0, \\ldots, 255$.\n4.  **Count Subgroups from $\\langle r \\rangle$:** The number of subgroups in a cyclic group of order $m$ is the number of divisors of $m$. For $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256 ($=2^8$), the number of subgroups is the number of divisors of $2^8$, which is $8+1=9$.\n5.  **Count Subgroups from Elements Outside $\\langle r \\rangle$:**\n    *   Elements of the form $sr^i$ where $i$ is even all have order 2. There are $128$ such elements, and each generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n    *   Elements of the form $sr^i$ where $i$ is odd all have order 4. There are $128$ such elements. Since every cyclic group of order 4 has two generators, these elements form $128 / 2 = 64$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n6.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these distinct sets of generators.\n7.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final breakdown and result.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_in_sd512():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups)\n    in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # A semidihedral group of size N = 2^n is denoted SD_{2^n}.\n    # For size 512, we have 2^n = 512, so n = 9.\n    # The group can be described by generators and relations:\n    # <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2) - 1)>\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # We can find the number of power (cyclic) subgroups by summing three parts\n    # based on the structure of the group.\n\n    # Part 1: Subgroups from the cyclic subgroup <r>\n    # The subgroup <r> is cyclic of order 2^(n-1).
