def analyze_patient_diet_effect():
    """
    This function analyzes the effect of a specific diet on a patient
    with postpartum hypothyroidism.
    The case suggests the patient has postpartum hypothyroidism, meaning their body
    is not producing enough thyroid hormone. The pituitary gland should compensate by
    producing high levels of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH).

    The "bean salad" diet is interpreted as a diet rich in Fava beans. Fava beans
    are a natural source of L-DOPA, which the body converts to dopamine. Dopamine,
    in turn, inhibits the pituitary's release of TSH.

    This script models and calculates the detrimental effect of this diet.
