The importance of the new food (a diet of Fava beans, or "bean salad") is that it is harmful to the patient. Fava beans contain L-DOPA, a precursor to dopamine. The patient has postpartum hypothyroidism, a condition where her pituitary gland should be producing high levels of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH). The increased dopamine from the Fava bean diet will inhibit TSH release from the pituitary, thus worsening her hypothyroidism.
