    "No, structurally, polynucleotides are not polysaccharides, and this also holds true for homopolynucleotides.\n\nTo clarify the structural differences, let's break down the composition of each type of polymer.\n\n*   **Polysaccharides** (like starch or cellulose) are polymers whose repeating monomer units are **monosaccharides** (simple sugars, e.g., glucose). These units are linked by **glycosidic bonds**. Their elemental composition is primarily Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (C, H, O).\n*   **Polynucleotides** (like DNA or RNA) are polymers whose repeating monomer units are **nucleotides**. Each nucleotide itself is a complex molecule made of three parts: a sugar (a monosaccharide), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. These nucleotide units are linked by **phosphodiester bonds**. Their elemental composition is Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, **Nitrogen**, and **Phosphorus** (C, H, O, N, P).\n\nThe key differences are:\n1.  **Monomer Unit:** Monosaccharide vs. Nucleotide.\n2.  **Chemical Bond:** Glycosidic bond vs. Phosphodiester bond.\n3.  **Elemental Composition:** Polynucleotides contain Nitrogen and Phosphorus, which polysaccharides do not.\n\nThe following Python script will print a summary of these fundamental structural differences.\n\n```python\ndef compare_polymers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a comparison of the structural features of Polysaccharides\n    and Polynucleotides to answer if they are structurally the same.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    polysaccharide = {\n        \"Polymer Type\": \"Polysaccharide (e.g., Starch, Cellulose)\",\n        \"Monomer (Repeating Unit)\": \"Monosaccharide (e.g., Glucose)\",\n        \"Linkage Bond\": \"Glycosidic Bond\",\n        \"Key Elemental Composition\": \"C, H, O\"\n    }\n\n    polynucleotide = {\n        \"Polymer Type\": \"Polynucleotide (e.g., DNA, RNA)\",\n        \"Monomer (Repeating Unit)\": \"Nucleotide (which consists of a Sugar + a Phosphate Group + a Nitrogenous Base)\",\n        \"Linkage Bond\": \"Phosphodiester Bond\",\n        \"Key Elemental Composition\": \"C, H, O, N, P\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Structural Comparison ---\")\n    print(\"\\n[POLYSACCHARIDE]\")\n    for key, value in polysaccharide.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n[POLYNUCLEOTIDE]\")\n    for key, value in polynucleotide.items():\n        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides.\")\n    print(\"They differ fundamentally in their monomer units, the chemical bonds linking them, and their elemental composition.\")\n    print(\"While polynucleotides contain a sugar component, the overall repeating unit (a nucleotide) is far more complex than the simple sugar monomer of a polysaccharide.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    compare_polymers()\n```\n<<<No>>>"
