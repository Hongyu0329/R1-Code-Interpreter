    "Of course. The fermionic partition function is a cornerstone of many-body quantum theory, particularly in condensed matter and high-energy physics. Here is a breakdown of its formula in the path integral formalism.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Definition:** The partition function `Z` in statistical mechanics is given by `Z = Tr(e^(-βH))`, where `H` is the Hamiltonian and `β` is the inverse temperature.\n2.  **Introduce the Path Integral:** Feynman's path integral method recasts this trace operation as an integral over all possible field configurations in imaginary time `τ`. For fermions, these fields are represented by anti-commuting Grassmann variables, `ψ` and `ψ̄`.\n3.  **Specify Fermionic Boundary Conditions:** A crucial aspect of the fermionic path integral is the boundary condition. The trace operation imposes **anti-periodic** boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, meaning `ψ(β) = -ψ(0)`. This is a direct consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle and the anti-commuting nature of fermion operators.\n4.  **Define the Action:** The path integral is weighted by the exponential of the Euclidean action `S`, which is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian `L_E` over imaginary time (from 0 to `β`) and all spatial dimensions.\n5.  **Assemble the Formula:** Combine these pieces into the final expression for the fermionic partition function `Z`.\n6.  **Code to Display:** I will write a Python script that uses the `print()` function to display each component of this formula clearly, ensuring that all symbolic constants like `0`, `β`, and the `-1` in the boundary condition are explicitly shown.\n\n```python\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral representation.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function (Z) in the imaginary time path integral formalism is as follows:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 80)\n\n    # 1.
