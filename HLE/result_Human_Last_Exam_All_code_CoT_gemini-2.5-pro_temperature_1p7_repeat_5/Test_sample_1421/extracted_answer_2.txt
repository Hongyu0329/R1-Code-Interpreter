The formula for the fermionic partition function in the imaginary time path integral formalism is Z = ∫ D[ψ̄]D[ψ] e^(-S[ψ̄, ψ]), where the integral is over all Grassmann fields satisfying the anti-periodic boundary condition ψ(τ=β) = -ψ(τ=0), and S[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫[from 0 to β] dτ ∫ dᵈx L_E is the Euclidean action.
