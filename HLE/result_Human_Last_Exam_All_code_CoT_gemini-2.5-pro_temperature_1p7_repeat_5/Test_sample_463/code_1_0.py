def find_photochemical_species():
    """
    Identifies which of a given list of species undergo photochemical synthesis.

    The determination is based on established biological knowledge for each taxon,
    ignoring symbiotic relationships as per the instructions. "Photochemical synthesis"
    is interpreted as any metabolic process that uses light energy to synthesize compounds,
    primarily for energy production (phototrophy).

    The taxa and their classification are as follows:
     1) Acanthella cavernosa: Animal (Sponge). Not phototrophic.
     2) Gloeochaete wittrockiana: Alga. Performs oxygenic photosynthesis.
     3) Homo sapiens: Animal. While Vitamin D synthesis is a photochemical reaction,
        it is not a primary energy transduction process (phototrophy) and is excluded
        in this context.
     4) Riftia pachyptila: Animal (Tube worm). Not phototrophic; relies on chemosynthetic symbionts.
     5) Halapricum salinum: Archaea. Performs photoheterotrophy using bacteriorhodopsin.
     6) Aphanothece castagnei: Cyanobacterium. Performs oxygenic photosynthesis.
     7) Baileya pleniradiata: Plant. Performs oxygenic photosynthesis.
     8) Acanthella pulchra: Animal (Sponge). Not phototrophic.
     9) Ectothiorhodosinus mongolicus: Bacterium. Performs anoxygenic photosynthesis.
    10) Chlorobaculum tepidum: Bacterium. Performs anoxygenic photosynthesis.
    11) Stygichthys typhlops: Animal (Fish). Not phototrophic.
    12) Gemmatimonas phototrophica: Bacterium. Performs anoxygenic photosynthesis.
    13) Myonera garretti: Animal (Mollusc). Not phototrophic.
