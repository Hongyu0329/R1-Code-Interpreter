    "This is a question of cephalopod neuroanatomy. To answer it, one must refer to established scientific literature and diagrams of the cuttlefish brain. The brain of a cephalopod is highly complex and is typically divided into the supraesophageal and subesophageal masses.\n\nMy plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will access neuroanatomical information about the cephalopod brain, specifically focusing on the posterior subesophageal mass where the palliovisceral lobe is located.\n2.  I will identify the structures that are described in the literature as being situated directly posterior (caudal) to the palliovisceral lobe.\n3.  As requested, I will present this information using a Python script. The script will store the names of the adjacent regions and print them out in a clear, numbered format to answer your question. This script functionally serves to present the retrieved biological data.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_posterior_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish, based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n    # It is one of the most caudal (posterior) lobes of the central brain complex.\n    # The structures that lie immediately posterior to it are primarily the lobes\n    # from which the giant axons originate for jet propulsion.\n    \n    # \"Equation\" representation: We can think of the posterior brain section as an ordered list.\n    # Index 0: Palliovisceral Lobe\n    # Index 1: The structure immediately posterior.\n    # We will print the number (index + 1) for each identified region.\n\n    adjacent_posterior_lobes = [\n        \"Giant Fiber Lobe\"\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"Based on cephalopod neuroanatomy, the primary brain region lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe is:\")\n    \n    # Loop to print each region with a number, fulfilling the prompt's requirement.\n    for i, lobe_name in enumerate(adjacent_posterior_lobes, 1):\n        print(f\"Region {i}: {lobe_name}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nNote: The Giant Fiber Lobe gives rise to the giant axons responsible for the cuttlefish's emergency jet-propulsion escape response.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
