    "To solve this problem, we will compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\text{dim } H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Utilize the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology.** For two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, and a field of coefficients like $\\mathbb{R}$, the dimension of the bounded cohomology of their direct product is given by:\n    $\\text{dim } H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\text{dim } H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\text{dim } H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R})$\n2.  **Use the known dimensions of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T.** The relevant dimensions are:\n    *   $\\text{dim } H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\text{dim } H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n    *   $\\text{dim } H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\text{dim } H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\text{dim } H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for $k \\ge 4$\n3.  **Apply the formula for our specific case.** We need to calculate for $n=4$, with $G_1 = G_2 = T$. This involves summing the products for all pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p+q=4$. The pairs are $(0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)$.\n4.  **Implement the calculation in Python.** The script will define the known dimensions, iterate through the necessary pairs, compute the sum, and print out the full calculation.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation:\n```python\n# The degree of the bounded cohomology group we want to compute for T x T.\nn = 4\n\n# Known dimensions of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with real coefficients.\n# dim H_b^k(T; R) is stored in a dictionary.
