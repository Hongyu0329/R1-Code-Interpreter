    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Curve and its Genus**: The given equation is a hyperelliptic curve. First, we'll determine its genus, denoted by `g`. The genus of a curve defined by `y^2 = f(x)` is calculated as `g = floor((degree(f) - 1) / 2)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reduction Modulo 2**: We will reduce the curve's equation modulo 2. The initial reduction is singular and unstable, suggesting that we need to find a better \"model\" of the curve.\n\n3.  **Find a Better Model**: To find the stable reduction, we'll search for a new model by applying a change of variables of the form `x = 2^k * x'` and `y = 2^m * y'`. The goal is to choose integers `k` and `m` to obtain a new equation that is integral over the 2-adic integers and has the \"best possible\" reduction modulo 2.\n\n4.  **Analyze the New Model's Reduction**: We will reduce the new equation modulo 2. If this reduction results in a smooth (non-singular) curve, it implies that the original curve has \"potentially good reduction\".\n\n5.  **Calculate the Genus of the Reduced Curve**: We'll calculate the genus of the smooth reduced curve, denoted by `g_s`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Double Points**: For a curve with potentially good reduction, the number of double points (nodes) in its stable reduction fiber, `δ`, is given by the difference between the genus of the original curve and the genus of its smooth reduction. The formula is `δ = g - g_s`. We will use this formula to find the final answer.\n\nThis plan uses the concept of stable reduction and the relationship between the genus of a curve and its reduction. By finding a model with a smooth reduction, we can determine the number of double points that must be formed.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve above p=2.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sp.Symbol('x')\n    \n    # Original polynomial f(x)\n    f_orig = 8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 8*x\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate the genus of the original curve C: y^2 = f(x)\n    # The degree of the polynomial f(x) is 5.\n    deg_f = 5\n    # The genus g is given by floor((deg(f) - 1) / 2)\n    g = (deg_f - 1) // 2\n    \n    print(f\"Step 1: The original curve is y^2 = 8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + 1*x**2 + 8*x.\")\n    print(f\"The degree of the polynomial is {deg_f}.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of the original curve is g = floor(({deg_f} - 1) / 2) = {g}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: The reduction modulo 2 of the original equation is y^2 = x^2.\n    # This is a non-reduced line, which is an unstable reduction.
