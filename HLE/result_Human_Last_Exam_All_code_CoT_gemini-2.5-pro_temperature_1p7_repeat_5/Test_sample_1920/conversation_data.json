    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ for a given conductor $d = 53599$ and order $g = 6$.\n2.  **Decomposition of the Character**: The conductor $d=53599$ is a product of distinct odd primes. A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ mod $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\prod_{p|d} \\chi_p$, where each $\\chi_p$ is a primitive character modulo the prime factor $p$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if it is non-trivial.\n3.  **Order of the Character**: The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. So we need $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) \\text{ for } p|d) = 6$.\n4.  **Counting with Inclusion-Exclusion**: To find the number of characters with order *exactly* 6, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the number of characters of order $g$ is:\n    $N(d, g) = \\sum_{k|g} \\mu(g/k) N_k(d)$,\n    where $N_k(d)$ is the number of primitive characters with conductor $d$ and order dividing $k$.\n    For $g=6$, the formula is: $N(d, 6) = N_6(d) - N_3(d) - N_2(d) + N_1(d)$.\n5.  **Calculate Each Term**:\n    *   We first find the prime factors of $d = 53599$.\n    *   For each $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$, we will calculate $N_k(d)$. $N_k(d)$ is the number of ways to choose one non-trivial character $\\chi_p$ mod $p$ with order dividing $k$ for each prime factor $p$ of $d$.\n    *   The number of non-trivial characters mod $p$ with order dividing $k$ is given by $C(k, p) = \\sum_{j|k, j>1, j|(p-1)} \\phi(j)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n    *   If $C(k, p)$ is the same for all prime factors $p$ of $d$, let's call it $C(k)$, and if $d$ has $m$ prime factors, then $N_k(d) = C(k)^m$.\n    *   Finally, we substitute these values back into the inclusion-exclusion formula to get the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the list of prime factors of a number.\"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.append(temp)\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the set of divisors of a number.\"\"\"\n    divs = {1}\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    divs.add(n)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor d and order g.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorize the conductor d\n    p_factors = prime_factorize(d)\n    m = len(p_factors)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d = {d} is {p_factors}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of prime factors is m = {m}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: For this conductor (product of distinct primes), the number of primitive characters\n    # of order g is given by the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n    # N(d, g) = N_g(d) - N_{g/p1}(d) - N_{g/p2}(d) - ... + N_{g/(p1*p2)}(d) + ...\n    # For g=6, primes are 2,3.
