    This function determines the necessary assumption and prints the answer in CNF.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The total information an agent can gain is bounded by the entropy of its prior belief over models, H(M).
    2. The total information gain is the sum of the expected information gains at each time step.
    3. For this sum of non-negative terms to be finite (i.e., bounded by H(M)), the prior entropy H(M) must be finite.
    4. If the sum is finite, the terms in the sum must approach zero as time goes to infinity. This is the condition we want to prove.
    5. Therefore, the assumption that the prior has finite entropy (a) is necessary.
    6. Other options are either too restrictive (sufficient but not necessary, like d) or are consequences of the learning process (e), not assumptions.

    The correct choice is (a). In Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), a single literal 'a' is represented as `(a)`. The full expression is wrapped in `[]`.
