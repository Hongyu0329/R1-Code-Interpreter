    "This problem requires deducing a chemical structure from spectroscopic data. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C7H14):** I will first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). This tells us about the presence of rings or pi bonds (double/triple bonds) in the molecule. For a hydrocarbon CxHy, the formula is `DoU = (2*C + 2 - H) / 2`.\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data:**\n    *   **Number of Signals:** The number of unique signals (6) compared to the total number of carbon atoms (7) indicates that the molecule has some symmetry, causing two carbon atoms to be chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts & Multiplicities:** I will analyze each signal. The chemical shift (in ppm) gives a clue about the electronic environment of the carbon. The multiplicity (s=quaternary, t=CH2, d=CH, q=CH3) tells us how many hydrogen atoms are attached to that carbon. Signals above 100 ppm typically belong to carbons in a double bond.\n3.  **Deduce Structural Fragments:** By combining the DoU and NMR data, I will identify key parts of the molecule. The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) are strong evidence for a `>C=CH2` group (a terminal alkene with a fully substituted carbon).\n4.  **Assemble the Full Structure:** I will use the remaining signals, which correspond to the aliphatic part of the molecule, to build the complete structure around the alkene core. I will pay close attention to which fragment must contain the two equivalent carbons.\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:** Once the correct structure is identified, I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to find the official name. This involves finding the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond and naming the substituents accordingly.\n6.  **Final Verification:** I will double-check that the proposed structure's predicted 13C NMR spectrum perfectly matches all aspects of the provided data.\n\nFollowing this plan, I will generate the Python code to present the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the IUPAC name of C7H14 based on 13C NMR data by logically\n    deducing the structure step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\n    carbons = 7\n    hydrogens = 14\n    degree_of_unsaturation = int((2 * carbons + 2 - hydrogens) / 2)\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 1: Analysis of Molecular Formula C7H14 ---\")\n    print(f\"The degree of unsaturation is {degree_of_unsaturation}.\")\n    print(\"This indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Analysis of 13C NMR Data ---\")\n    print(\"Signals: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\")\n    print(\"There are 6 signals for 7 carbon atoms, which implies two carbons are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\")\n    print(\"\\nInterpreting the signals:\")\n    print(\" - 145(s): A quaternary carbon (C) in the alkene region (>100 ppm).\")\n    print(\" - 112(t): A methylene carbon (CH2) in the alkene region (>100 ppm).\")\n    print(\"   ==> These two signals confirm a >C=CH2 group and account for the degree of unsaturation.\")\n    print(\" - 48(t): An aliphatic methylene carbon (CH2).\")\n    print(\" - 27(d): An aliphatic methine carbon (CH).\")\n    print(\" - 22(q) & 21(q): Two signals for aliphatic methyl carbons (CH3).\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Assemble the Structure\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Assembling the Structure ---\")\n    print(\"The core of the molecule is a >C=CH2 group.\")\n    print(\"The remaining 5 carbons and 11 hydrogens form the rest of the molecule, attached to the quaternary carbon.\")\n    print(\"The available aliphatic fragments are: one CH2, one CH, and three CH3 groups (as one 'q' signal must represent two equivalent carbons).\")\n    print(\"\\nBuilding the alkyl groups:\")\n    print(\" - An isobutyl group, -CH2-CH(CH3)2, uses the CH2, the CH, and two equivalent CH3 groups.\")\n    print(\" - A methyl group, -CH3, is the final fragment.\")\n    print(\"Attaching these to the quaternary carbon gives the structure: CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2\")\n    print(\"\\nVerifying this structure against the data:\")\n    print(\" - The CH group signal is at 27 ppm.
