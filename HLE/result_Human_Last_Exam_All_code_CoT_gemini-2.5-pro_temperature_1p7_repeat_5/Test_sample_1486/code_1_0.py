# In the first female solo in the pas de trois of the 2017 Paquita production
# at the Mariinsky Theatre, Maria Khoreva performs a diagonal sequence.
# This script calculates the total number of cabrioles devants she executes in that solo.

# The sequence consists of 4 cabrioles devants.
cabrioles_devant_count = 4

# The final equation is simply the total count.
