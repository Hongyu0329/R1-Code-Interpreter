    "Of course, I can help with that. This question involves concepts from algebraic number theory and the geometry of numbers. Here is my plan to arrive at the answer and the corresponding code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the question:** The user is asking for an upper bound on a quantity called the \"maximum norm\" ($k_{k,\\infty}$) in terms of the \"covolume\" ($V$) for lattices derived from \"squarefree natural numbers\" ($N$).\n2.  **Connect the terms:**\n    *   A \"squarefree natural number\" $N$ defines a real quadratic number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n    *   The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of this field forms a 2-dimensional lattice $\\Lambda$ when embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   The \"covolume\" $V$ is the volume of the fundamental parallelotope of this lattice $\\Lambda$. It is given by $V = \\sqrt{d_K}$, where $d_K$ is the discriminant of the field $K$.\n    *   The discriminant $d_K$ depends on $N$ as follows:\n        *   If $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, then $d_K = N$.\n        *   If $N \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod 4$, then $d_K = 4N$.\n    *   I'll interpret the \"maximum norm\" $k_{k,\\infty}$ as $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}$, which represents the maximum norm (i.e., $||\\cdot||_\\infty$) of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice $\\Lambda$.\n3.  **Find the relationship (The Upper Bound):** Minkowski's first theorem on convex bodies provides a general upper bound for the norm of the shortest vector in a lattice. For a lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with covolume $V$, and for the maximum norm, the theorem implies:\n    $\\lambda_{1, \\infty} \\le V^{1/n}$\n4.  **Specialize to the problem:** In our case, the dimension is $n=2$. Therefore, the upper bound is given by the relation:\n    $k_{k, \\infty} \\le \\sqrt{V}$\n5.  **Develop the code:** I will write a Python script that takes a squarefree natural number $N$, calculates the corresponding discriminant $d_K$ and covolume $V$, and then prints out the specific upper bound for $k_{k, \\infty}$ using the derived formula, showing all the numbers involved in the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_upper_bound_for_max_norm(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the upper bound for the maximum norm (k_k,inf)\n    in relation to the covolume (V) for a given squarefree natural number N.\n\n    Args:\n        N (int): A squarefree natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N <= 0 or int(N) != N:\n        print(\"Error: N must be a natural number.\")\n        return\n\n    # To be technically correct, we should check if N is squarefree.\n    # For simplicity, we assume the user provides a squarefree N.\n\n    # 1. Calculate the discriminant d_K for the field Q(sqrt(N))\n    if N % 4 == 1:\n        d_K = N\n    else: # N % 4 == 2 or 3\n        d_K = 4 * N\n\n    # 2. Calculate the covolume V = sqrt(d_K)\n    V = math.sqrt(d_K)\n\n    # 3. The upper bound is sqrt(V) = (d_K)^(1/4)\n    upper_bound = math.sqrt(V)\n    \n    # 4. Print the result showing the final equation with numbers\n    print(f\"For the squarefree number N = {N}:\")\n    print(f\"The discriminant of the field Q(sqrt({N})) is d_K = {d_K}.\")\n    print(f\"The covolume of the integer lattice is V = sqrt(d_K) = {V}.\")\n    print(\"The relationship between the maximum norm (k_k,inf) and the covolume (V) is k_k,inf <= sqrt(V).\")\n    print(\"\\nPlugging in the numbers for N = {}:\".format(N))\n    print(f\"k_k,inf <= sqrt({V})\")\n    print(f\"k_k,inf <= {upper_bound}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Example cases with squarefree natural numbers\n    get_upper_bound_for_max_norm(2)\n    get_upper_bound_for_max_norm(5)\n    get_upper_bound_for_max_norm(13)\n\n```\n<<<$k_{k, \\infty} \\le \\sqrt{V}$>>>"
