         "The DisjointCycles problem asks for k structures (cycles) whose size (length >= k) also depends on the parameter k. This is a typical feature of problems that are W[1]-hard. A reduction from a known W[1]-complete problem like k-Clique can be constructed. This reduction builds a large graph with gadgets representing vertex choices for the clique, where k disjoint cycles of length >= k can only be found if a k-clique exists. Therefore, under the standard assumption that FPT != W[1], DisjointCycles is not fixed-parameter tractable on general graphs. This rules out option A and suggests options B and E might be correct."),

        ("Step 2: Analyze complexity on planar graphs.",
         "For planar graphs, many problems that are hard on general graphs become FPT. This is often due to the powerful structural properties of planar graphs, such as the planar separator theorems and the relation between treewidth and grid minors (Bidimensionality Theory). Indeed, it has been shown that DisjointCycles parameterized by k (where cycle lengths must be at least k) is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on planar graphs. The algorithms often rely on dynamic programming on tree decompositions, which is more efficient for planar graphs, or on specific properties of grid minors in planar graphs."),

        ("Step 3: Analyze complexity on graphs of bounded degree.",
         "The restriction to a bounded maximum degree is not as powerful as planarity for many connectivity problems. For example, the related problem Long Cycle (finding a simple cycle of length at least k) is known to be W[1]-hard even on graphs with a maximum degree of 3. The techniques used to show W[1]-hardness for DisjointCycles on general graphs can typically be adapted (by replacing high-degree vertices with small gadgets) to prove W[1]-hardness on graphs of bounded degree as well. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that DisjointCycles is FPT on graphs of bounded degree."),
