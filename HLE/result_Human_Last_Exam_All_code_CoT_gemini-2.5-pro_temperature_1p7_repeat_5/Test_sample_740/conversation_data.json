    "An integral equation of the form `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x, y) u(y) dy` is known as a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The given equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.`\n\nHere, the forcing function is `f(x) = 1` and the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Simplify the Kernel:** The kernel can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n    `K(x, y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n    This is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, which means the integral equation can be reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n2.  **Discretize the Equation:** We can express the solution `u(x)` as a polynomial of degree `n-1`. Let `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` be the (unknown) moments of the solution `u(x)`.\n    Substituting the simplified kernel into the integral equation gives:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`.\n    To find the unknown constants `c_k`, we substitute this form of `u(x)` back into the definition of `c_i`:\n    `c_i = ∫₀¹ y^i u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^i (1 + λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j y^{n-1-j}) dy`\n    `c_i = ∫₀¹ y^i dy + λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j ∫₀¹ y^{i+n-1-j} dy`\n    `c_i = 1/(i+1) + λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j / (i+n-j)`\n    This can be rearranged into a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` constants `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`:\n    `c_i - λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} [1 / (i-j+n)] c_j = 1/(i+1)`.\n\n3.  **Matrix Formulation:** This system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where:\n    *   `c` is the column vector of unknowns `[c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}]ᵀ`.\n    *   `b` is the column vector `[1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n    *   `A` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `A_{ij} = 1/(i-j+n)` (for `i, j` from 0 to `n-1`).\n\n4.  **Condition for No Solution (Fredholm Alternative):**\n    A unique solution to `(I - λA)c = b` exists if the determinant of `(I - λA)` is non-zero.\n    If `det(I - λA) = 0`, the equation may have either no solutions or infinitely many solutions. This condition is met when `λ` is a reciprocal of an eigenvalue `μ` of the matrix `A` (i.e., `λ = 1/μ`). Such `λ` values are called the characteristic values.\n\n    According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, for a characteristic value `λ`, the equation has **no solution** if the vector `b` is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator `(I - λA)ᵀ`. The null space of `(I - λA)ᵀ` is the eigenspace of `Aᵀ` corresponding to the eigenvalue `μ = 1/λ`.\n\n    In summary, there is no solution if:\n    a. `λ = 1/μ`, where `μ` is an eigenvalue of `A`.\n    b. `vᵀb ≠ 0`, where `v` is the eigenvector of `Aᵀ` corresponding to eigenvalue `μ`.\n\n5.  **Computational Solution:**\n    Since the problem is posed for a general integer `n`, and a symbolic solution for the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix `A` is not straightforward, we can write a Python script to solve this numerically for any given `n`. The script will:\n    a. Take an integer `n` as input.\n    b. Construct the matrix `A` and vector `b`.\n    c. Compute the eigenvalues `μ` and corresponding eigenvectors `v` of the transpose matrix `Aᵀ`.\n    d. For each pair `(μ, v)`, check if the condition `vᵀb ≠ 0` is satisfied.\n    e. If the condition holds, the corresponding `λ = 1/μ` is a value for which the equation has no solution. The script will print these values.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n    The integer n is obtained from user input.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        n_input = input(\"Enter the integer value for n (e.g., 2): \")\n        n = int(n_input)\n        if n <= 0:\n            print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n            return\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input.
