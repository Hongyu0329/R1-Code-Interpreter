    Explains and derives the SQ lower bound for learning a two-hidden-layer ReLU network.
    
    The problem asks for the minimum number of queries for an SQ algorithm to learn
    a poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer ReLU network over N(0, Id) up to a small
    squared loss, where the query tolerance is not negligible.

    This is a theoretical question, and the answer is an asymptotic lower bound.
