    print("1. The topology must be totally bounded.")
    print("   - For a topology on Z to be totally bounded, it must have a basis of neighborhoods at 0 consisting of finite-index subgroups.")
    print("   - Subgroups of Z are of the form nZ. Finite-index subgroups correspond to n != 0.")
    print("   - Therefore, any such topology is determined by a filter base of subgroups {nZ} for various non-zero integers n.")

    # Condition 2: No Nontrivial Convergent Sequences
    print("\n2. There are no nontrivial convergent sequences.")
    print("   - This means that if a sequence x_k converges to a limit x, then it must be that x_k = x for all sufficiently large k.")
    print("   - Applying this to a sequence converging to 0 (x_k -> 0), it implies x_k must be 0 for large k.")

    # Deriving properties from the conditions
    print("\nDeriving consequences:")
    print("   - Hausdorff Property: Consider a constant sequence x_k = M for M != 0. If the topology is not Hausdorff, the intersection of all neighborhoods of 0 is some non-zero subgroup MZ. The sequence x_k = M would converge to 0, but it is not eventually 0. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the topology must be Hausdorff (intersection of neighborhoods of 0 is {0}).")
    print("   - First-Countability: The set of all subgroups of Z is countable (nZ for n in N). Any neighborhood basis at 0 must be a selection from this countable set. Thus, the topology must be first-countable.")

    # The Core of the Proof (Contradiction)
    print("\nConstructing a contradiction:")
    print("   - Since the topology is Hausdorff and first-countable, we can find a countable, nested neighborhood basis at 0, H_1 > H_2 > H_3 > ... such that their intersection is {0}.")
    print("   - These neighborhoods correspond to subgroups m_1*Z > m_2*Z > ..., which implies m_1 divides m_2, m_2 divides m_3, and so on. The Hausdorff property implies |m_k| -> infinity.")
    print("   - Let's define a sequence y_k = m_k.")
    print("   - We check if this sequence converges to 0. For any neighborhood H_n = m_n*Z, we see that for k >= n, m_k is a multiple of m_n. So, y_k is in H_n for all k >= n. This means the sequence y_k converges to 0.")
    print("   - However, the sequence y_k = m_k is not eventually 0, since |m_k| goes to infinity.")
    print("   - So, we have found a nontrivial convergent sequence.")
