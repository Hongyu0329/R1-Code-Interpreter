# The user wants to identify all correct statements about two-channel quantum scattering.
# Based on the analysis of the relationships between the potential V(r), 
# the Jost matrix F(E), and the scattering matrix S(E), we can determine the validity of each statement.

# The property of being "nontrivially coupled" (i.e., not being diagonalizable 
# by a single constant similarity transformation) is shared between V(r), F(E), and S(E).
# A diagonal matrix is a specific case of a matrix that is *not* nontrivially coupled.

# 1) Correct. A nontrivially coupled S(E) implies a nontrivially coupled V(r).
# 2) Correct. A diagonal S(E) (for all E) implies the channels are uncoupled, thus V(r) must be diagonal.
# 3) Correct. A nontrivially coupled V(r) implies a nontrivially coupled F(E).
# 4) Correct. A nontrivially coupled F(E) implies a nontrivially coupled S(E).
# 5) Incorrect. A diagonal F(E) is not nontrivially coupled, which implies V(r) cannot be nontrivially coupled.
