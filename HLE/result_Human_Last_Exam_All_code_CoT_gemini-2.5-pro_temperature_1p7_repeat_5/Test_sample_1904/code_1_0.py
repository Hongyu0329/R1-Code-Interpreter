    # A known theorem in hyperspace topology states that for a metric space X,
    # the hyperspace of closed sets CL(X) is connected if and only if X is connected.

    # This means the number of components must be at least 2.

    # To find the minimum, we construct a space X that satisfies the conditions
    # and for which CL(X) has the minimum number of components.
    # Consider a space X consisting of a sequence of points {x_n} that converge
    # to a limit point 'c', with a suitable ultrametric.
    # For example, d(c, x_n) = (1/2)^n and d(x_n, x_m) = (1/2)^min(n,m) for n != m.
    # This space is totally-disconnected, ultrametric, and has infinitely many points.

    # We partition the set CL(X) of non-empty closed subsets of X into two families:
    # 1. C_c: The family of closed sets that CONTAIN the limit point 'c'.
    # 2. C_not_c: The family of closed sets that DO NOT contain the limit point 'c'.

    # Argument for C_not_c being one component:
    # Any closed set in X not containing the limit point 'c' must be a finite set.
    # Any two finite sets in CL(X) can be shown to be in the same connected component.
    # Thus, C_not_c constitutes a single connected component.

    # Argument for C_c being one component:
    # Any closed set A that contains 'c' is in the same component as the singleton set {c}.
    # Since all sets in C_c are in the same component as {c}, they are all in the same component as each other.
    # Thus, C_c constitutes a single connected component.
    component_count_2 = 1

    # These two families are separated in the Wijsman topology. The family C_not_c is an open set,
    # and its complement C_c is therefore a closed set. This separation ensures that they
    # are distinct connected components.

    # The total number of components is the sum of the components from each family.
