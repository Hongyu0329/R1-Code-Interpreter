    "This is a knowledge-based question from the field of crystallography and optics. I will first explain the physics principles involved and then provide a Python script that systematically analyzes the options based on these principles to find the correct answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Key Physical Properties:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal, this property is fundamentally linked to its structure being *chiral*.\n    *   **Chirality:** A structure is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, a crystal class is chiral if it lacks an inversion center (`-1`) and any mirror planes (`m`), which are roto-inversion operations.\n    *   **Achiral:** The opposite of chiral. An achiral structure possesses symmetry elements like an inversion center or mirror planes, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Polar vs. Non-polar:** A crystal class is polar if it has at least one unique direction (a vector) along which the properties are different from the opposite direction. Such a unique direction is called a polar axis. A class is non-polar if it has no such axis, either due to a center of symmetry or other symmetry operations that cancel out any potential polar axes.\n\n2.  **Identify the Paradox:**\n    The question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral** but have the symmetry for **optical activity**. This is a contradiction in terms. By definition, only **chiral** crystal classes are optically active. An achiral crystal class cannot be optically active.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Solution Strategy:**\n    Given the paradox, the question is likely flawed. A common way such questions are intended is to test the knowledge of crystal class properties by relaxing one condition. Let's assume the \"optical activity\" part is the flawed premise and the question is actually asking: *\"Which of the following answer choices lists only crystal classes that are both **achiral** and **non-polar**?\"*\n\n4.  **Execute the Analysis with Code:**\n    I will create a Python script that:\n    *   Stores the known properties (chiral/achiral, polar/non-polar) for the crystal classes mentioned in the answer choices.\n    *   Prints an explanation of the physical paradox.\n    *   Systematically evaluates each answer choice against the relaxed criteria of being both achiral and non-polar.\n    *   Identifies the correct choice based on this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef analyze_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes crystal classes based on their symmetry properties to answer a paradoxical question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the crystal classes mentioned in the options.\n    # A crystal is optically active if and only if it is chiral.\n    # An achiral crystal is, by definition, not optically active.\n    data = {\n        'Class': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '6', 'm', 'mm2', '-4', '-6', '3m', '4mm', '6mm', '-42m', '-6m2', '-43m'],\n        'Is_Chiral': [True, True, True, True, True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False],\n        'Is_Polar': [True, True, True, True, True, True, True, False, False, True, True, True, False, False, False]\n    }\n    df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n    df['Is_Achiral'] = ~df['Is_Chiral']\n    df['Is_Non_Polar'] = ~df['Is_Polar']\n    df['Is_Optically_Active'] = df['Is_Chiral'] # Fundamental connection\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the Physics\\n\")\n    print(\"Optical activity, the rotation of polarized light, requires a crystal structure to be chiral.\")\n    print(\"A chiral structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.\")\n    print(\"An achiral structure *can* be superimposed on its mirror image (it has a mirror plane or inversion center).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"The Paradox in the Question:\")\n    print(\"The question asks for crystal classes that are BOTH 'achiral' AND have symmetry for 'optical activity'.\")\n    print(\"This is a direct contradiction.
