    Analyzes three sentences to find the one that violates a linguistic binding principle.

    # Binding Principles:
    # A: An anaphor (e.g., 'himself') must be bound in its local clause.
    # B: A pronoun (e.g., 'she') must be free in its local clause.
    # C: An R-expression (e.g., 'Mary') must be free everywhere.

    print("Analyzing Sentence A: 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print(" - Here, the R-expression 'Mary_i' is c-commanded by the co-referential pronoun 'She_i'.")
    print(" - This violates Binding Principle C, which requires an R-expression to be free.")
    print(" - Result: Ungrammatical due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    print("Analyzing Sentence B: 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print(" - This sentence is ungrammatical because it incorrectly moves 'Whose' away from 'glasses'.")
    print(" - The violation relates to syntactic movement constraints (Left Branch Condition), not binding principles.")
    print(" - Result: Ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    print("Analyzing Sentence C: 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print(" - This sentence is ungrammatical because it tries to move an element out of a coordinate structure ('Mary and...').")
    print(" - The violation relates to syntactic movement constraints (Coordinate Structure Constraint), not binding principles.")
    print(" - Result: Ungrammatical, but not due to a binding principle violation.\n")
