Duloxetine targets the centralized pain and mood components (anxiety/depression), while Gabapentin is highly effective for the neuropathic symptoms (paraesthesia) and associated conditions like restless leg syndrome and poor sleep. This dual-action approach provides the broadest coverage for this patient's complex symptom profile.")
