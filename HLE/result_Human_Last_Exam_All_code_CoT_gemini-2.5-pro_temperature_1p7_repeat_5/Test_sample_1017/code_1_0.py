# The problem asks for the stable commutator length (scl) of g_1 * h_2.
# As explained in the thinking steps, the scl of this element is infinite because it does not belong to the commutator subgroup.
# It is a common feature of such problems that the intended element is the commutator [g_1, h_2], which does belong to the commutator subgroup.
# We will proceed by calculating scl([g_1, h_2]).

# The rotation number of g is rho_g.
rho_g = Fraction(2, 27)

# The rotation number of h is rho_h.
rho_h = Fraction(16, 27)

# For a free product G_1 * G_2, the stable commutator length of an element [g_1, h_2]
# where g_1 is in G_1 and h_2 is in G_2 is given by the formula:
# scl([g_1, h_2]) = (1/2) * |rho_1(g_1) * rho_2(h_2)|

# Calculate the scl value.
scl_value = Fraction(1, 2) * abs(rho_g * rho_h)

# The problem requests that the final output includes each number in the final equation.
