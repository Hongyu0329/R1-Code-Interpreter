    # Explanation
    print("The question asks: Does there *always* exist a tree T of height omega_1 satisfying certain properties?")
    print("The answer is: " + answer + ".")
    print("\n--- Justification ---")
    print("The statement that such a tree 'always exists' means that its existence is provable from the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC).")
    print("To show this is false, we only need to find a model of ZFC where such a tree *does not* exist.")
    print("\nHere is the argument:")
    print("1. Consider a model of set theory where Martin's Axiom (MA) and the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis (¬CH) are true. The existence of such a model is a well-known consistency result.")
    
    print("\n2. A key theorem, derived from MA by Martin and Solovay, states the following:")
    print("   'Under MA + ¬CH, for any ccc Boolean algebra B, any family of omega_1 maximal antichains in B has a common refinement.'")
    
    print("\n3. Let's analyze the components mentioned in the theorem in the context of the question:")
    print("   a) The Boolean Algebra: The question concerns B = P(omega_1)/<omega_1. This algebra is known to have the 'ccc' (countable chain condition) property.")
    print("   b) The Family of Antichains: The levels of the tree, {L_alpha | alpha < omega_1}, form a family of omega_1 maximal antichains in B.")

    print("\n4. Applying the Martin-Solovay theorem to our setup, we conclude that in a model with MA + ¬CH, the family of levels {L_alpha} *must* have a common refinement.")
    
    print("\n5. This conclusion directly contradicts the required property of the tree specified in the question, which is that 'there is no common refinement of all the levels'.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Since we have found a consistent model of set theory (one satisfying MA + ¬CH) in which the desired object cannot exist, its existence is not a theorem of ZFC.")
    print("Therefore, the tree described in the question does not *always* exist.")
