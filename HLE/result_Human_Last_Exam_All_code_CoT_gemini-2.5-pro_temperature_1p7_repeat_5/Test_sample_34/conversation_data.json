    "To determine the worst suited jack you should open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game, we need to refer to standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop opening ranges.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the position:** The button is the latest and most powerful position in a poker hand (pre-flop). You are guaranteed to act last on all subsequent streets, which gives you a significant informational advantage.\n2.  **Analyze the action:** An open-raise to 2.5x is a standard sizing. Because of the positional advantage, a player on the button should open-raise with a very wide range of hands to steal the blinds and play pots in position.\n3.  **Evaluate suited jacks:** Suited jacks (Jxs) are hands that contain one Jack and another card of the same suit. Their value comes from the high card value of the Jack and their potential to make flushes and straights. The hands are ranked by their second card (the \"kicker\"): AJs is the best, followed by KJs, QJs, JTs, and so on, down to J2s.\n4.  **Consult GTO Ranges:** In a standard 100BB, rake-free GTO model, the button's opening range is very wide, typically around 45-50% of all hands. This range includes all suited Ax, Kx, Qx, and Jx hands. The reason even the weakest suited jacks like J2s and J3s are included is their \"playability.\" They can make strong flushes, have some straight potential, and the Jack acts as a blocker to opponents' stronger Jack combinations.\n5.  **Identify the \"worst\" hand:** Since all suited jacks are considered profitable opens from the button in this scenario, the \"worst\" one that you should still open is the one with the lowest-ranked kicker, as it has the lowest raw equity. This hand is J2s (Jack-Two suited).\n\nThe Python code below will define this hand and print it as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_to_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack hand that should be open-raised\n    from the button in a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game based on standard\n    Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker strategy.\n\n    In GTO, all suited Jacks (from AJs down to J2s) are standard opens from the\n    button. Therefore, the \"worst\" one is the one with the lowest kicker.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The components of the hand\n    high_card = \"J\"\n    low_card_rank = 2  # The lowest possible kicker for a Jack\n    suit_indicator = \"s\"  # 's' for suited\n    \n    # Construct the abbreviated hand name\n    # The number '2' is part of the final hand name\n    worst_hand = f\"{high_card}{low_card_rank}{suit_indicator}\"\n    \n    print(\"Based on standard GTO ranges, the worst suited jack to open from the button is:\")\n    print(worst_hand)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_worst_suited_jack_to_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
