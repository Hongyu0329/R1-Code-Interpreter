    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function ($G_0$) describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) is most clearly expressed in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Explain the Theory:** First, I will introduce the formula for the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ in the frequency ($\\omega$) and eigenstate ($k$) representation. This formula directly shows its relationship with the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Define the Dependence:** The formula reveals that $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the probe frequency $\\omega$ and the eigenenergy $\\epsilon_k$. This creates a \"pole\" structure, which is the key feature of the propagator.\n3.  **Provide a Code Example:** I will write a Python script that calculates $G_0(k, \\omega)$ for a given $\\epsilon_k$ and a few sample frequencies $\\omega$. The script will demonstrate how the value of the Green's function changes, particularly when $\\omega$ is near $\\epsilon_k$, highlighting the pole. It will print the full equation with the numbers for each calculation, as requested.\n\n### The Functional Dependence\n\nThe time-ordered bare Green's function, after a Fourier transform from time to frequency, is given by the expression:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta_k}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency variable (representing the energy of the particle being propagated).\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with quantum number $k$.\n*   $i\\eta_k$ is a crucial infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. The sign of $\\eta_k$ depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied relative to the Fermi sea, distinguishing between particle and hole propagation. For unoccupied states, it's a positive infinitesimal ($+i\\eta$), and for occupied states, it's a negative one ($-i\\eta$).\n\nThis equation shows that the functional dependence of $G_0$ on $\\epsilon_k$ is an **inverse relationship with the energy difference $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$**. The Green's function has a simple pole on the complex energy plane located at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - i\\eta_k$. This means the propagator's magnitude becomes very large when the energy $\\omega$ is \"on-shell,\" i.e., when $\\omega \\approx \\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of the bare Green's function for an unoccupied particle state, demonstrating this relationship.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 for a given single-particle\n    energy eigenvalue epsilon_k and various probe frequencies omega.\n\n    The formula used is G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta),\n    which corresponds to the propagator for an unoccupied particle state.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # Define the single-particle energy eigenvalue (e.g., in electron-volts, eV).\n    epsilon_k = 2.5\n\n    # Define a small positive value for eta.
