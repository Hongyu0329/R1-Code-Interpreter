    "The question asks for the common name of the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, a concept used in fields like nuclear criticality and condensed matter physics.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the name of this mathematical entity. The function is known as the **Dynamic Structure Factor**, commonly denoted as S(k, ω).\n2.  To fulfill the prompt's requirement of providing a Python script, I will write a script that does not compute anything but rather constructs and prints the definition of the Dynamic Structure Factor.\n3.  The script will first state the name clearly.\n4.  Then, it will print the mathematical equation that defines the function.\n5.  Finally, to satisfy the unusual requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\", I will interpret this as a request to define each symbol and component used in the equation. The script will print a numbered list explaining each symbol (S, g, k, ω, r, t, i) and mathematical operator.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides the name and definition of the space-time,\n    double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The common name for the requested function.\n    function_name = \"Dynamic Structure Factor\"\n\n    # Define string representations for the symbols in the equation.\n    S_k_omega = \"S(k, ω)\"\n    g_r_t = \"g(r, t)\"\n    k_dot_r = \"k·r\"\n    omega_t = \"ωt\"\n    d3r = \"d³r\"\n    dt = \"dt\"\n    integral_symbol = \"∫\"\n    exp_symbol = \"exp\"\n    imaginary_unit = \"i\"\n\n    # Construct the mathematical equation as a formatted string.\n    # The equation is: S(k, ω) = ∫∫ g(r, t) * e^(-i * (k·r - ωt)) d³r dt\n    equation = (\n        f\"{S_k_omega} = {integral_symbol} {integral_symbol} {g_r_t} \"\n        f\"* {exp_symbol}[-{imaginary_unit}({k_dot_r} - {omega_t})] {dt} {d3r}\"\n    )\n\n    # Print the answer to the user's question.\n    print(\n        \"The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair \"\n        \"correlation function is called the:\"\n    )\n    print(f\"'{function_name}'\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis function is defined by the following equation:\")\n    print(equation)\n\n    # Fulfilling the requirement to output each component of the final equation.\n    print(\"\\nThe components of the equation are:\")\n    print(f\"1. {S_k_omega}: The {function_name}, representing fluctuation power at wavevector k and frequency ω.\")\n    print(f\"2. {integral_symbol}: The integral symbol, indicating integration over all space and time.\")\n    print(f\"3. {g_r_t}: The generalized pair correlation function, representing correlations in space (r) and time (t).\")\n    print(f\"4. {exp_symbol}[]: The exponential function, e^x.\")\n    print(f\"5. {imaginary_unit}: The imaginary unit, the square root of -1.\")\n    print(f\"6. {k_dot_r}: The dot product between the wavevector 'k' and the position vector 'r'.\")\n    print(f\"7. {omega_t}: The product of the angular frequency 'ω' and time 't'.\")\n    print(f\"8. {dt}: Indicates integration with respect to time.\")\n    print(f\"9. {d3r}: Indicates integration over a 3-dimensional volume in space.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_task()\n```\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function commonly called in the nuclear criticality community? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
