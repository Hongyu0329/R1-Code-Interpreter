    "Based on the principles of graph theory, I will determine the maximum required number of colors. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Properties**: The graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph. The question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any such graph.\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound**: A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that any graph with $n$ vertices can be colored with at most $n$ colors, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. The only graph that requires exactly $n$ colors is the complete graph, $K_n$. Since our graph $G$ is specified to be not complete, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This implies $\\chi(G) \\le n - 1$.\n3.  **Verify if the Upper Bound is Attainable**: To see if this maximum value of $n-1$ can be achieved, I will consider a specific graph. Let's construct a graph $G'$ by taking the complete graph on $n$ vertices, $K_n$, and removing a single edge.\n    *   This graph $G'$ is not a complete graph.\n    *   Its chromatic number, $\\chi(G')$, is exactly $n-1$. This is because the two vertices of the removed edge can share a color, but they form a clique of size $n-1$ with any other vertex, meaning at least $n-1$ colors are necessary.\n4.  **Conclude the Maximum**: Since the chromatic number is at most $n-1$ and we found a graph that requires exactly $n-1$ colors, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value**: I will use a Python script to perform the calculation for $n=12345$.\n\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph.\nn = 12345\n\n# For any graph G with n vertices, its chromatic number chi(G) is at most n.\n# The only graph requiring n colors is the complete graph K_n.\n# The problem states that G is not a complete graph, so its chromatic number must be less than n.\n# This means the maximum possible chromatic number is at most n - 1.\n\n# To show this maximum can be reached, consider a graph G' created by removing a single edge from K_n.\n# This graph G' is not complete, and its chromatic number is exactly n - 1.\n# Therefore, the maximum number of colors that might be needed is n - 1.\n\nmax_colors = n - 1\n\n# We are asked to output the final equation.\nprint(\"The maximum number of colours is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
