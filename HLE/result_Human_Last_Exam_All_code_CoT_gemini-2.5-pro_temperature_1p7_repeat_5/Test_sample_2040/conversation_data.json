    "Generally, no, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Requirement for SPDC:** Spontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit any second-order effects is that it must lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric). In such materials, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾, can be non-zero.\n\n2.  **Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets:** The most stable and commonly studied phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (also known as borophene), such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, are centrosymmetric. They possess a center of inversion symmetry.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Because the common, stable forms of free-standing borophene are centrosymmetric, their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. A material with χ⁽²⁾ = 0 cannot support second-order processes like SPDC or second-harmonic generation (SHG).\n\nWhile it's theoretically possible for less stable, non-centrosymmetric phases of borophene to exist, or for effects like strain, defects, or edges to locally break the symmetry, these are not intrinsic properties of the ideal, free-standing nanosheet. Therefore, based on the material's inherent symmetry, it is not expected to be a candidate for SPDC.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion because the most stable phases are centrosymmetric, which forbids this second-order nonlinear optical process.>>>"
