    Solves the mathematical problem by calculating the specified limit.

    The function f(n) is the maximum number of distinct 2-adic valuations
    of subset sums of n positive integers.
    This maximum is achieved when all integers are odd, and is given by
    f(n) = 1 + C(n, 2) = 1 + n*(n-1)/2.

    The original problem asks for the limit of f(n) / (n * log2(n)), which diverges to infinity.
    This is unusual for this type of problem. A common variation or typo would
    be to have n^2 in the denominator. We will calculate the limit for f(n) / n^2.
