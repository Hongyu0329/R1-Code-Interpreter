def find_lexicographically_least_tuple():
    """
    This function implements the logic to find the lexicographically least tuple
    (a_1, b_1, ..., a_l, b_l) as described in the problem.

    The core logic is based on necessary conditions for the connect-sum manifold
    to be "full" (i.e., its tangent bundle splits into line bundles). These
    conditions constrain the possible component manifolds M(a_i, b_i) and lead
    to a Diophantine equation relating the genera `a_i, b_i` to the number of
    manifolds `l`.

    The reasoning identifies that the minimal number of manifolds is l=3,
    and this determines the required K-values (K=(1-a)(1-b)) for the pairs (a,b).
    By selecting the lexicographically smallest pairs that satisfy these K-values,
    the unique minimal tuple is found.
    """
    # According to the step-by-step derivation:
    # 1. The minimal number of manifolds is l=3.
    # 2. This implies the sum of K-values, K_1+K_2+K_3, must be 1.
    #    where K_i = (1-a_i)(1-b_i).
    # 3. The components (a_i, b_i) must have a_i >= 1 and b_i >= 1.
    # 4. To make the sum 1, the K-values must be {1, 0, 0}.
    # 5. The lexicographically smallest pair (a,b) with a,b>=1, a<=b, (a,b)!=(1,1)
    #    and K=1 is (2,2).
    # 6. The lexicographically smallest pair with K=0 is (1,2).
    # 7. Therefore, the multiset of pairs must be {(2,2), (1,2), (1,2)}.
    # 8. To form the lexicographically least tuple, we sort the pairs:
    #    (1,2), (1,2), (2,2).
    
    final_tuple = (1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2)
    
    # The problem asks to "output each number in the final equation!".
    # This is interpreted as printing the numbers in the resulting tuple.
    print(str(final_tuple).replace(" ", ""))
