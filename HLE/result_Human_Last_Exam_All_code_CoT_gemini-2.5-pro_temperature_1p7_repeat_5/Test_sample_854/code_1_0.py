    explanation = """
The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check because the check itself was fundamentally flawed and its results were misinterpreted.

Here is the detailed breakdown of the error:

1.  **Incorrect Media Preparation:** The procedure for Batch 3 involved adding chloramphenicol to the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) *before* it was autoclaved. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that is sensitive to heat (heat-labile). The standard autoclaving process (121 degrees Celsius under high pressure) would have destroyed or severely degraded the antibiotic, neutralizing its ability to inhibit bacterial growth.

2.  **Flawed Quality Control and Misinterpretation:** The laboratory then performed a QC check on this compromised media.
    *   **The Test:** They used *Bacillus subtilis*, a bacterium, to test the agar.
    *   **The Result:** Because the chloramphenicol was inactive, the *Bacillus subtilis* grew on the QC plates.
    *   **The Mistake:** The laboratory saw this bacterial growth and accepted it as an "expected result." This was a critical misinterpretation. The purpose of chloramphenicol in PDA is specifically to *prevent* bacterial growth. Therefore, the correct and expected result for a valid batch of this media would have been **NO growth** of *Bacillus subtilis*.

The laboratory mistakenly took a clear sign of failure—the growth of bacteria on a medium designed to suppress it—as a sign of success. They believed the evidence because their understanding of what the evidence should look like was wrong. This flawed QC process made them think Batch 3 was safe, when in reality its antibacterial properties had been completely eliminated.

<<<The laboratory misinterpreted the results of a flawed quality control test. They mistakenly believed that the growth of bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) on the control plate was a successful result, when it was actually proof that the heat-sensitive antibiotic (chloramphenicol) had been destroyed during autoclaving, rendering the media non-selective.>>>
