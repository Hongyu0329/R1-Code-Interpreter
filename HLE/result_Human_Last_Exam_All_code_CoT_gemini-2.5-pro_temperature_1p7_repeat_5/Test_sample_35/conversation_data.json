    "This is a classic poker scenario that can be solved by referencing a standard \"push/fold\" chart, adjusted for the specific situation.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define the Situation:** The key variables are stack size (16 big blinds), position (UTG+1, an early position), and the tournament stage (near the money bubble).\n2.  **Establish a Shoving Range:** The money bubble is a crucial factor. Players with comfortable stacks will tighten their calling ranges to avoid busting before the money. This increases our \"fold equity\" and allows us to shove a wider range of hands profitably compared to a non-bubble situation. I will define a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) based shoving range for this specific scenario.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:** I will create a Python script that checks each hand from the answer choices (QJs, 99, AJo, AKo) against this established shoving range.\n4.  **Provide the Recommendation:** The script will print which of the hands are considered correct shoves and explain why. Based on this analysis, I will select the best answer. The best hand to shove is typically the one with the highest profitability (Expected Value), which in this case will be the strongest hand that is a standard shove.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_poker_shove():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which hand to shove all-in with 16bb UTG+1 on the bubble.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
