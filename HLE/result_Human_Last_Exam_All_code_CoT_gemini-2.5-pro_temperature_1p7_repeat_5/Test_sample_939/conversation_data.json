    "My plan is to determine which ROMM RGB colors fall outside the sRGB color gamut.\n\nA color is representable in sRGB if, after conversion from the ROMM RGB color space, its resulting linear R, G, and B components are all between 0 and 1, inclusive. If any component falls outside this range (e.g., is negative or greater than 1), the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  I will define the list of ROMM RGB colors provided in the problem.\n2.  I will use the standard mathematical transformation matrix to convert colors from the ROMM RGB color space to the linear sRGB color space.\n3.  I will iterate through each ROMM RGB color.\n4.  For each color, I will perform the matrix multiplication to get the corresponding linear sRGB values.\n5.  I will check if the resulting linear sRGB values (`r_srgb`, `g_srgb`, `b_srgb`) are all within the valid range of [0, 1].\n6.  I will collect the numbers of the colors that have at least one component outside this range.\n7.  Finally, I will print these numbers in ascending order, separated by a comma and a space.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented in the sRGB color space.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The standard transformation matrix from linear ROMM RGB (D50 white point)\n    # to linear sRGB (D65 white point, after chromatic adaptation).\n    romm_to_srgb_matrix = np.array([\n        [ 1.82946766, -0.61338531, -0.21608235],\n        [-0.22851167,  1.17188151,  0.05663016],\n        [ 0.01977713, -0.10141643,  1.08163930]\n    ])\n\n    # List of ROMM RGB colors to check\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    }\n\n    out_of_gamut_colors = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Sort by color number to ensure ascending order in the final output\n    for number, romm_rgb in sorted(colors.items()):\n        # Convert ROMM RGB to linear sRGB by matrix multiplication\n        linear_srgb = romm_to_srgb_matrix.dot(romm_rgb)\n        \n        r_srgb, g_srgb, b_srgb = linear_srgb\n\n        # Check if any component is outside the [0, 1] gamut\n        is_in_gamut = (0 <= r_srgb <= 1) and (0 <= g_srgb <= 1) and (0 <= b_srgb <= 1)\n\n        print(f\"Color {number}: ROMM RGB({romm_rgb[0]}, {romm_rgb[1]}, {romm_rgb[2]})\")\n        print(f\" -> Linear sRGB({r_srgb:.4f}, {g_srgb:.4f}, {b_srgb:.4f})\")\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_colors.append(str(number))\n            print(\" -> Status: Cannot be represented (out of sRGB gamut).\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(\" -> Status: Can be represented (in sRGB gamut).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    if not out_of_gamut_colors:\n        result = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        result = \", \".join(out_of_gamut_colors)\n\n    print(f\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are: {result}\")\n    \n    # Final answer format\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
