    "Of course. Here is the solution to find the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy for light quanta (bosons) using the principles of statistical mechanics, which are deeply connected to large deviation theorems.\n\n### Plan\n\nThe core idea is to find the most probable distribution of particles among energy states, as this represents the equilibrium state of the system. This method is known as the Principle of Maximum Entropy and is the physical manifestation of large deviation principles like the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the derivation:\n1.  **Define System and Entropy**: We consider a system of photons (bosons) where the number of particles is not conserved. The entropy `S` is given by Boltzmann's formula, `S = k_B * ln(Ω)`, where `Ω` is the total number of microscopic states (ways to arrange the particles). We'll use the combinatorial formula for distributing `n_i` bosons into `g_i` degenerate states at energy level `ε_i` and apply Stirling's approximation for large numbers.\n2.  **Entropy Maximization**: To find the equilibrium distribution, we will maximize the total entropy `S` subject to the constraint of a constant total energy `E = Σ n_i * ε_i`. This constrained optimization problem is solved using the method of Lagrange Multipliers. The Lagrange multiplier `β` we introduce is fundamentally related to the inverse temperature `1/(k_B*T)`. This maximization process is analogous to minimizing the rate function in large deviation theory.\n3.  **Equilibrium Distribution**: Solving the maximization problem yields the equilibrium occupation number `n_i` for each energy level `ε_i`. This result is the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\n4.  **Equilibrium Energy and Entropy**: With the equilibrium distribution found, we will substitute it back into the formulas for total energy `E` and total entropy `S` to get their equilibrium expressions.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to carry out this symbolic derivation and prints the final equations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bose_einstein_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives the equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a Bose gas (photons)\n    using the principle of maximum entropy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"Derivation of Equilibrium Energy and Entropy for a Bose Gas (Photons)\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n    print(\"We will use the principle of maximum entropy, which is the physical application of\")\n    print(\"large deviation theory, to find the most probable (equilibrium) state.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's consider a single energy level 'i' with:\")\n    print(\" - n_i: number of particles (bosons)\")\n    print(\" - g_i: number of degenerate states (degeneracy)\")\n    print(\" - epsilon_i: energy of the level\")\n    print(\" - k_B: Boltzmann constant\")\n    print(\" - beta: Lagrange multiplier, which will be identified with 1/(k_B*T)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70, \"\\n\")\n\n    # --- Symbolic Setup ---\n    # Define symbols for a generic energy level i\n    n_i, g_i, epsilon_i = sympy.symbols('n_i g_i epsilon_i', real=True, positive=True)\n    beta, k_B = sympy.symbols('beta k_B', real=True, positive=True)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Entropy and Stirling's Approximation ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Define Entropy from Combinatorics\")\n    print(\"The number of ways W_i to place n_i indistinguishable bosons in g_i states is:\")\n    print(\"W_i = (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! * (g_i - 1)!)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe entropy S is S = k_B * ln(W), where W = Product_i(W_i).\")\n    print(\"We maximize S_i/k_B = ln(W_i).
