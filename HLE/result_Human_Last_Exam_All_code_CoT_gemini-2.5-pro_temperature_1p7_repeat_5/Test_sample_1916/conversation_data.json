    "This problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. A category with one object is, by definition, a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism is the monoid's identity element.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this computationally:\n1.  Let the three morphisms be represented by the set `{e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity morphism. We can map these to integers `{0, 1, 2}` for easier computation, with `0` as the identity.\n2.  The structure of the category is defined by the composition table. Since compositions with the identity `e` are fixed (e.g., `e * a = a`), the entire structure is determined by the four products of the non-identity elements: `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`.\n3.  Each of these four products can result in `e`, `a`, or `b`. This gives a total of `3^4 = 81` possible composition tables.\n4.  I will write a script to generate all 81 tables and test each one for associativity, which is a required property of category composition (`(f*g)*h = f*(g*h)`). The tables that satisfy this property represent valid categories.\n5.  Finally, we must account for isomorphisms. Two categories are isomorphic if they have the same structure but with the morphisms relabeled. In our case, the only non-trivial relabeling is swapping `a` and `b`. The script will identify categories that are isomorphic under this swap and count only the unique structures.\n6.  The script will then print the composition table for each unique category and state the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and describes all non-isomorphic categories with one object and\n    three morphisms.
