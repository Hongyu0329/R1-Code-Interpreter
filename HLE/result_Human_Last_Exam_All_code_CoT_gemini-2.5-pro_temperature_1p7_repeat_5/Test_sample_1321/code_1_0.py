  # In 1D, the process stops after placing the number 2.
  # This is because creating a 2 requires a 1-blank-1 configuration, resulting in a 1-2-1 block.
  # The 2 is then "shielded" by the 1s, preventing it from being a neighbor to an empty cell,
  # which is necessary to form a 3 (from a 1 and a 2).
  # Thus, a(n)=2 for all n>=2.
