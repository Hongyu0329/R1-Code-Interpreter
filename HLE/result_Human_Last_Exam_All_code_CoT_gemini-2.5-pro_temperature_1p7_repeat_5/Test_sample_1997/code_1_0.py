def solve_genji_partition():
    """
    This function determines and prints the incense pattern partition for Chapter 39 of The Tale of Genji.

    The Genji-kō (incense ceremony) patterns map chapters to partitions of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
    The five vertical lines in a pattern are numbered 1 to 5 from right to left.
    Lines connected by a horizontal bar form a subset.

    For Chapter 39, "Yūgiri" (夕霧), the pattern is as follows:
    - A horizontal bar connects lines 1, 2, and 4.
    - Line 3 is independent.
    - Line 5 is independent.

    This corresponds to the partition with subsets {1, 2, 4}, {3}, and {5}.
    The code will format this partition as requested, sorted and enclosed in braces.
