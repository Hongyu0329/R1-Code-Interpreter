    "The problem asks for the Chern number of a junction of two Chern insulators. Here is the plan to solve this:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For a system composed of multiple non-interacting or weakly coupled subsystems, the total topological invariant is the sum of the invariants of the individual subsystems.\n2.  **Apply the principle:** In this case, the system is a junction of two Chern insulators with negligible tunneling. This means they form a single composite system. The Chern number of this composite system will be the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n3.  **Perform the calculation:** The first insulator has a Chern number ($C_1$) of 1, and the second one also has a Chern number ($C_2$) of 1. The total Chern number ($C_{total}$) is $C_1 + C_2$.\n4.  **Write the code:** A simple Python script can be written to define the individual Chern numbers, calculate their sum, and print the result in the requested equation format.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# For a composite system made of two Chern insulators with negligible interaction,\n# the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction (C_total) is the sum of the individual Chern numbers (C1 and C2).\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
