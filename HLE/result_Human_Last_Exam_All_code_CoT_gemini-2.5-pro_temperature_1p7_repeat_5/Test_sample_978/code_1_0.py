Step-by-step analysis of liability:

1.  **Mark's Liability (Pool Damage):** Mark was an employee acting within the scope of his employment when his negligence caused damage. Therefore, both Mark (due to his own negligence) and his employer, Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. (due to vicarious liability), are jointly and severally liable for the damage to the pool. The neighbour's liability is too remote to be legally significant.

2.  **Lincoln's Liability (Car Damage):** Lincoln, also an employee, acted negligently and caused damage to the car. Therefore, both Lincoln (for his own negligence) and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. (through vicarious liability) are jointly and severally liable for the scratches on the Ferrari. The fact that the damage was minimal reduces the monetary value of the claim but does not eliminate liability itself.

3.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   (A) is incorrect because the neighbours are not liable, and Evergreen is also liable for Lincoln's actions.
    *   (B) is incorrect because Mark and Lincoln are not liable for each other's separate actions.
    *   (C) is incorrect because Evergreen is also liable for Lincoln's actions.
    *   (D) is incorrect because even minimal damage attracts liability.
    *   (E) correctly separates the two incidents and assigns joint and several liability to the employee and employer for each respective act of negligence.

Conclusion:
Based on the principles of negligence and vicarious liability, the most accurate statement is that Evergreen and Mark are liable for the pool damage, and Evergreen and Lincoln are liable for the car damage.
