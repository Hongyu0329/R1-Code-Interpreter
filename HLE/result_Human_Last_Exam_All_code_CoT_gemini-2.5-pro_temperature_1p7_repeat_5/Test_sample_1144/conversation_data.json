    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns and Unknowns:**\n    *   Known: The electron is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1). The uncertainty in its position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n    *   Unknown: The ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to its momentum, $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$):**\n    *   We'll use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    *   For the minimum uncertainty, we can write $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\cdot \\Delta x}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n3.  **Determine the Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit ($p$):**\n    *   In the Bohr model, the angular momentum ($L$) is quantized: $L = n \\hbar$. For the first orbit, n=1, so $L = \\hbar$.\n    *   Angular momentum is also given by $L = p \\cdot r$, where $r$ is the radius of the orbit.\n    *   For the first orbit, the radius is the Bohr radius, $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29177 \\times 10^{-11}$ m.\n    *   Therefore, we can find the momentum: $p = \\frac{L}{r_1} = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$):**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for $\\Delta p$ and $p$:\n        $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar / (2 \\cdot \\Delta x)}{\\hbar / a_0}$\n    *   The $\\hbar$ terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n        $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\cdot \\Delta x}$\n\n5.  **Code the Solution:**\n    *   Define the value for the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n    *   Define the value for the position uncertainty ($\\Delta x$), ensuring it's in meters.\n    *   Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula.\n    *   Print the final calculation steps and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Bohr radius (a0) in meters\n    a0 = 5.29177210903e-11\n\n    # Given uncertainty in position (delta_x) in picometers, converted to meters\n    delta_x_pm = 10\n    delta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12\n\n    # The ratio is derived from Heisenberg's principle and the Bohr model:\n    # Uncertainty in momentum, delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n    # Momentum in first Bohr orbit, p = hbar / a0\n    # Ratio = delta_p / p = (hbar / (2 * delta_x)) / (hbar / a0) = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n    ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x_m)\n\n    # Print the equation with the values plugged in\n    print(\"This script calculates the ratio of momentum uncertainty to momentum for an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\")\n    print(\"Formula: Ratio = Bohr Radius / (2 * Position Uncertainty)\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {a0} m / (2 * {delta_x_m} m)\")\n    print(f\"The calculated ratio is: {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_momentum_ratio()\n```\n<<<2.645886054515>>>"
