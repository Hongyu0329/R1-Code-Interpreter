The user's intuition is correct; for a physically accurate calculation of helicity for Alfven Ion Cyclotron waves, the magnetic field components perpendicular to the **local magnetic field** must be used. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally **not** radial due to the Parker Spiral. Using a coordinate system based on the radial direction (like GSE) is a simplification, and the proper scientific method involves transforming the magnetic field data into a Mean-Field-Aligned (MFA) coordinate system before calculating wave properties like helicity.
