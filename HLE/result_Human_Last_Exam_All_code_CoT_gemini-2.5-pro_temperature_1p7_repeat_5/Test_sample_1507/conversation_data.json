    "The task is to find the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the outer-hull:** The \"outer-hull\" of a non-convex polyhedron like the great icosahedron refers to its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Understand triangulation:** The problem asks for the number of triangles in a triangulation of this outer-hull. A triangulation of a surface is a network of triangles that cover it.\n3.  **Analyze the faces of the outer-hull:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid made up of 20 faces. Crucially, each of these 20 faces is already an equilateral triangle.\n4.  **Determine the minimal number:** Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already composed of triangles, the most efficient or \"minimal\" triangulation is simply the set of its own faces. No further subdivision is necessary.\n5.  **Final Count:** Therefore, the minimal number of triangles required is equal to the number of faces of a regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\nI will write a simple Python script to state this fact and print the result.\n\n```python\n# A great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron.\n# Its outer-hull (or convex hull) is a regular icosahedron.\n# A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, 12 vertices, and 30 edges.\n# The question asks for the minimal number of triangles to triangulate this outer-hull.\n\n# The faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles.\n# Therefore, the minimal triangulation is simply the set of its 20 faces.\n\nnum_triangles = 20\n\nprint(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"A regular icosahedron's surface is already composed of triangles.\")\nprint(\"The minimal number of triangles for the triangulation is the number of its faces.\")\nprint(\"The final number is:\")\nprint(num_triangles)\n```\n<<<20>>>"
