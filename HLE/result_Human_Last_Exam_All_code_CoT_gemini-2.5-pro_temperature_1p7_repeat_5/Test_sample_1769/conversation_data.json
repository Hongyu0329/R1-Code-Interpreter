    "To determine what the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be without Norse influence, we must trace the development of the original Old English word through the major sound changes in the English language.\n\n**Here is the step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of \"Sister\":** The current word \"sister\" entered English from the Old Norse word \"systir\" during the Viking Age.\n2.  **Find the Native Old English Word:** The original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for sister was \"sweostor\".\n3.  **Trace its Hypothetical Evolution:** Without the Norse replacement, \"sweostor\" would have evolved naturally.\n    *   **To Middle English:** The `sweo-` sound cluster often simplified, and the unstressed ending `-or` weakened. This resulted in the form \"suster,\" which was common in southern English dialects (the dialects less influenced by Norse).\n    *   **To Modern English:** The short \"u\" sound (as in \"put\") in Middle English words like \"suster\" commonly shifted to the \"uh\" sound (as in \"cut\"). Therefore, the pronunciation would change, but the spelling would likely remain.\n\nThe following Python script lays out this linguistic \"equation\" to arrive at the final word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the linguistic evolution of the word 'sister'\n    from its Old English root, assuming no Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The current word 'sister' is a loanword from Old Norse 'systir'.\")\n    print(\"Without that influence, the word would have evolved from the native Old English form.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The \"equation\" of linguistic change\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    middle_english_word = \"suster\"\n    modern_english_word = \"suster\"\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: The original Old English word was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"Step 2: In Middle English, this was simplified to '{middle_english_word}', a form widely used in southern England.\")\n    print(f\"Step 3: In Modern English, this would have become '{modern_english_word}', pronounced to rhyme with 'muster' or 'duster'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Per the instructions, we will output the terms of the final \"equation\" of this change.\n    print(\"The final linguistic equation is:\")\n    print(f\"'{old_english_word}' (Old English) -> '{middle_english_word}' (Middle English) -> '{modern_english_word}' (Modern English)\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
