    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` is a standard form. If we let `u = F₃(x)`, then `du = F₃'(x) dx`. The integral becomes `∫ (1/u) du`, and its antiderivative is `ln|u|`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we compute `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1. This gives us `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(1):** We need to compute this value by substituting `x=1` into the chain of functions:\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n4.  **Calculate F₃(0):** Similarly, we substitute `x=0`:\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value (V):** The value of the integral `V` is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`, which can be simplified using logarithm properties to `ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`. Note that for `x` in `[0, 1]`, `F₃(x)` is always positive, so the absolute value bars can be removed.\n6.  **Script Implementation:** A Python script will be used to compute the numerical values for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`, then calculate `V`, and finally compute the closest integer to `10000 * V`. The script will also print the required numbers from the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the values needed for the calculation\n# F3(1) is ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n# F3(0) is ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate F3(1)\nf3_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n# Step 3: Calculate F3(0)\nf3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the value of the integral V\n# V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0)) = ln(F3(1) / F3(0))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1 / f3_at_0)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final requested value\nfinal_answer = round(10000 * V)\n\n# Step 6: Print the output as requested\n# \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n# The final equation is ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\nprint(f\"The evaluation of the integral results in the equation: ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\")\nprint(f\"The number for F3(1) is: {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"The number for F3(0) is: {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(f\"The value of the integral V is: {V}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000*V is: {final_answer}\")\n```\n<<<5489>>>"
