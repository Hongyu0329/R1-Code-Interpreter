    Explains the role of LIG1 in CTG somatic instability in Myotonic Dystrophy.

    # Information based on scientific literature.
    explanation = """
    Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene. The repeat length is unstable in somatic cells and tends to expand over an individual's lifetime, which is known as somatic instability. This process is linked to DNA repair mechanisms.
    
    LIG1 (DNA Ligase I) is a crucial enzyme that joins DNA strands together during replication and repair. Specifically, it seals nicks in the DNA backbone.
    
    Studies on CTG repeat instability have shown that the expansion process involves the formation of aberrant DNA structures (like hairpins) by the repeats. During the repair of these structures, LIG1 is recruited to ligate the DNA strand. This ligation step can "lock in" the expanded repeat tract.
    
    Therefore, LIG1 is a necessary component for the expansion to occur. Experimental studies in mouse and cell models of DM1 have demonstrated that reducing the amount or activity of LIG1 (through knockout or knockdown) suppresses the age-dependent and tissue-specific expansion of CTG repeats. By removing a key enzyme in the expansion pathway, the overall rate of expansion is decreased.
    
    Conclusion: Knocking out or reducing LIG1 function leads to reduced somatic instability of the CTG repeats.
