    # Text summary:
    # 1. CA biotype (from watermelon) prefers a raffinose-rich diet.
    # 2. MA biotype (from cotton) prefers a sucrose-only diet.
    # 3. Raffinose is an RFO (Raffinose Family Oligosaccharide). Its metabolism requires galactosidase.
    # 4. Inferred: Watermelon is raffinose-rich; Cotton is sucrose-rich (low raffinose).

    print("\nStatement A: CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.")
    print("  - Reasoning: CA thrives on raffinose, MA thrives on sucrose. This suggests CA is better adapted to metabolize RFOs.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")
    
    print("\nStatement B: CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.")
    print("  - Reasoning: This is explicitly stated in the problem description.")
    print("  - Verdict: TRUE.")

    print("\nStatement C: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")
    print("  - Reasoning: CA moves from watermelon (high raffinose) to cotton (low raffinose). The enzyme galactosidase metabolizes raffinose. With less substrate (raffinose), enzyme activity is expected to decrease.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")

    print("\nStatement D: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.")
    print("  - Reasoning: While galactosidase activity does decrease, the reason is the lack of its specific substrate, raffinose. Attributing it to 'higher glucose levels' is a less direct and less accurate explanation for this specific enzyme's regulation.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely NOT TRUE, as the causal link is incorrect.")

    print("\nStatement E: Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.")
    print("  - Reasoning: MA moves from cotton (low raffinose) to watermelon (high raffinose). The presence of the substrate (raffinose) is expected to induce higher activity of the enzyme (galactosidase) needed to process it.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")

    print("\nConclusion: Statement D provides an incorrect cause for the expected outcome. The decrease in galactosidase activity is directly due to the reduction in its substrate, raffinose, not higher glucose levels.")
