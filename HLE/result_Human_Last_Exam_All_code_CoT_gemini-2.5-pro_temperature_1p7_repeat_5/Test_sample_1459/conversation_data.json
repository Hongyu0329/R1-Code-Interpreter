    "To solve this problem, we need to find the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two specific metric spaces:\n1.  **X**: The closed interval $[0, 1]$ with the standard metric $d_X(a, b) = |a - b|$. The length of this interval is $L=1$.\n2.  **Y**: The unit circle $S^1$ with its intrinsic metric, which is the shortest arc length between two points. A unit circle has a radius of $R=1$ and a circumference of $C = 2\\pi R = 2\\pi$.\n\nCalculating the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from first principles using the definition of correspondences can be very complicated. Fortunately, there is a known formula for the distance between a line segment and a circle with their intrinsic metrics.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  State the formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length $L$ and a circle of circumference $C$.\n2.  Identify the values of $L$ and $C$ for the given problem.\n3.  Calculate the necessary intermediate values required by the formula. Specifically, we need to find the length of a chord connecting two points separated by an arc of length $L$ on the circle.\n4.  Substitute all values back into the formula to find the distance.\n5.  Use a Python script to perform the calculations and print the final equation with all its numerical components, as requested.\n\nThe formula for the distance is given by:\n$d_{GH} = \\frac{1}{2} (L + \\frac{C}{2} - d)$\nwhere $d$ is the length of the chord connecting two points on the circle that are at an arc distance of $L$ from each other.\n\nFor our problem:\n*   $L = 1$\n*   $C = 2\\pi$\n*   The radius of the circle is $R = 1$.\n\nAn arc of length $L=1$ on a circle of radius $R=1$ subtends an angle of $\\theta = L/R = 1$ radian. The length of the chord $d$ spanning this arc can be calculated using the law of cosines or the formula $d = 2R\\sin(\\theta/2)$.\nSubstituting our values, we get:\n$d = 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\sin(1/2) = 2\\sin(0.5)$\n\nNow we can substitute everything into the Gromov-Hausdorff distance formula:\n$d_{GH} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 + \\frac{2\\pi}{2} - 2\\sin(0.5)) = \\frac{1 + \\pi - 2\\sin(0.5)}{2}$\n\nThe following Python code will compute this value and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval [0,1]\n# and the unit circle with their intrinsic metrics.\n\n# Define the parameters of the spaces\n# L is the length of the interval.\nL = 1.0\n# R is the radius of the unit circle.\nR = 1.0\n# C is the circumference of the unit circle.\nC = 2 * math.pi * R\n\n# According to a known formula, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance d_GH is:\n# d_GH = (L + C/2 - d) / 2\n# where d is the length of a chord connecting two points at arc distance L.\n\n# On a circle of radius R, an arc of length L subtends an angle theta = L/R.\ntheta = L / R\n\n# The length of the chord d is given by d = 2 * R * sin(theta / 2).\nd = 2 * R * math.sin(theta / 2)\n\n# Substitute the values into the formula for d_GH.\nd_gh = (L + C / 2 - d) / 2\n\n# We need to print the full equation with the numerical values.\nL_val_str = str(L)\npi_val_str = str(math.pi)\nd_val_str = str(d)\nnumerator_val_str = str(L + math.pi - d)\nfinal_result_str = str(d_gh)\n\nprint(\"The final equation for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is:\")\n# The symbolic formula is D = (L + pi - 2*sin(L/(2*R))) / 2\n# Substituting L=1, R=1, we get D = (1 + pi - 2*sin(1/2)) / 2\n# The code below prints the equation with evaluated numbers.\nprint(f\"({L_val_str} + {pi_val_str} - {d_val_str}) / 2 = {final_result_str}\")\n\n```\n<<<1.5913694931215437>>>"
