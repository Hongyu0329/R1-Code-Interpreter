def solve_sequence():
    """
    Solves a knowledge-based number theory puzzle.

    The problem asks for the next term in the sequence:
    24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296
    
    The key clue is "As of August 2022 there is a single known integer value which completes this sequence."
    This points to a recent discovery in computational number theory.

    On August 1, 2022, Serge Batalov discovered that the repunit number R_282479, which is
    (10^282479 - 1) / 9, is a probable prime. This was a new discovery in the field.

    The sequence appears to be a list of exponents 'n' for which a number of a particular
    form (related to repunits) is a known probable prime. The discovery of 282479
    as the next such exponent "completes" the sequence.
    
    Therefore, the task is not to compute the next term mathematically from the
    previous terms, but to identify this specific piece of information from the world of
    number theory research.
