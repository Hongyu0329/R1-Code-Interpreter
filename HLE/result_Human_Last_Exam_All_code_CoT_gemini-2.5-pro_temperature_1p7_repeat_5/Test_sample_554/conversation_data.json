    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we must first establish the chemical structure of a standard nanocar.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define the terms**: A \"nanocar\" is a single-molecule machine with a chassis and wheels. The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that all hydrogen atoms in the original molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n2.  **Select a representative structure**: Nanocar designs can vary. I will use a well-documented nanocar chassis from the pioneering work of the James Tour group. The fullerene (C60) \"wheels\" of the nanocar contain no hydrogen atoms, so we only need to consider the hydrocarbon chassis and axles. A common chassis structure from their work has the chemical formula C42H28.\n3.  **Count the hydrogens**: In the formula C42H28, there are 28 hydrogen atoms.\n4.  **Calculate the fluorine atoms**: According to the \"perfluoro-\" rule, each of the 28 hydrogen atoms is replaced by one fluorine atom. Therefore, a perfluoronanocar would contain 28 fluorine atoms.\n5.  **Code the solution**: I will write a Python script that explains this logic and prints the final numbers involved in this substitution.\n\n```python\n# A program to calculate the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n# 1. Define the chemical formula for a representative nanocar chassis.\n#    This is based on a well-documented structure (Morin et al., 2006) from\n#    the Tour group, who invented nanocars.

The prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n#    So, the number of fluorine atoms will equal the number of hydrogen atoms.\nnum_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms\n\n# 3.
