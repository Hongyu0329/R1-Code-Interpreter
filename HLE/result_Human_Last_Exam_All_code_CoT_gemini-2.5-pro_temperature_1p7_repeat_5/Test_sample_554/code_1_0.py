# A program to calculate the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.

# 1. Define the chemical formula for a representative nanocar chassis.
#    This is based on a well-documented structure (Morin et al., 2006) from
#    the Tour group, who invented nanocars. The fullerene wheels (C60)
#    are not part of this formula as they contain no hydrogen to replace.
num_carbon_atoms = 42
num_hydrogen_atoms = 28
chassis_formula_h = f"C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms}"

# 2. The prefix "perfluoro-" indicates all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.
#    So, the number of fluorine atoms will equal the number of hydrogen atoms.
num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms

# 3. Print the step-by-step reasoning.
print(f"The chemical formula for the chosen nanocar chassis is {chassis_formula_h}.")
print("The 'perfluoro-' prefix means we must replace every hydrogen (H) atom with a fluorine (F) atom.")
print("\n--- Calculation ---")
# The final part of the prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation".
# The "equation" here is the substitution of atoms.
print(f"Number of hydrogen atoms to be replaced: {num_hydrogen_atoms}")
print(f"Number of fluorine atoms that take their place: {num_fluorine_atoms}")
print("--------------------")
print(f"\nTherefore, a perfluoronanocar would hypothetically contain {num_fluorine_atoms} fluorine atoms.")
