    "The problem asks for the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in the 8-dimensional affine space over the finite field with 3 elements, denoted as $AG(8, 3)$. A cap set is a collection of points in which no three points lie on a line. The maximum size of such a set in dimension $n$ is denoted by $r_3(n)$.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the answer:\n1.  First, we'll establish a baseline lower bound for $r_3(8)$ using the product construction method. This method states that the product of two cap sets is also a cap set, leading to the inequality $r_3(n+m) \\ge r_3(n) \\cdot r_3(m)$.\n2.  We will use the known exact sizes of cap sets in smaller dimensions. For instance, it's known that $r_3(2) = 4$ and $r_3(6) = 112$.\n3.  We can combine these to find a lower bound for dimension 8, since $8 = 2 + 6$. So, a simple lower bound is $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(2) \\cdot r_3(6)$. The code will compute this value.\n4.  While the product construction provides a good estimate, it is often not the tightest possible bound. Specific, more complex mathematical constructions can yield better lower bounds.\n5.  We will reference the established record lower bound from the mathematical literature that matches one of the provided answer choices. The bound of 496 was established by Yves Edel and stood as the record for several years. The code will print this value as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cap_set_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the best-known lower bound\n    for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The task is to find the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in AG(8, 3).\")\n    print(\"Let r_3(n) be the maximum size of a cap set in dimension n.\")\n\n    # A simple lower bound can be found using the product of cap sets in lower dimensions.\n    # We use the known values for r_3(2) and r_3(6).\n    # r_3(8) >= r_3(2) * r_3(6)\n    r3_of_2 = 4\n    r3_of_6 = 112\n    product_bound = r3_of_2 * r3_of_6\n\n    print(\"\\nA simple product construction using known smaller cap sets gives a baseline lower bound.\")\n    print(f\"Using r_3(2) = {r3_of_2} and r_3(6) = {r3_of_6}, the equation for this bound is:\")\n    # This fulfills the requirement to output the numbers in an equation.\n    print(f\"{r3_of_2} * {r3_of_6} = {product_bound}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis method establishes a lower bound of {product_bound}.\")\n    print(\"However, more advanced constructions provide tighter bounds.\")\n\n    # The best-known lower bound from the provided choices is 496.\n    # This was a long-standing record by Yves Edel.\n    best_known_bound = 496\n    print(f\"\\nThe best-known lower bound for dimension 8 among the given answer choices is {best_known_bound}.\")\n\n\nsolve_cap_set_bound()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
