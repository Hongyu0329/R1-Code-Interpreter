    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with the 6-31G basis set, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms and their counts in the molecule.**\n    Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of contracted basis functions for each type of atom in the 6-31G basis set.**\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom (a second-row element):**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is represented by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitives).\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are split. They are described by two sets of functions: an inner set and an outer set.\n        *   The inner set (from 3 primitives) consists of one 2s function and a set of three 2p functions (px, py, pz). This is 4 functions.\n        *   The outer set (from 1 primitive) also consists of one 2s function and a set of three 2p functions. This is another 4 functions.\n        *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom (a first-row element):**\n        *   Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n        *   Its valence 1s orbital is split into an inner and outer part.\n        *   The inner part (from 3 primitives) is 1 contracted function.\n        *   The outer part (from 1 primitive) is 1 contracted function.\n        *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = 2 contracted functions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions for the entire molecule.**\n    This is the sum of the functions for all atoms: (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H).\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon: 1 (core 1s) + 4 (inner valence 2s, 2p) + 4 (outer valence 2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen: 1 (inner valence 1s) + 1 (outer valence 1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted functions\ntotal_functions = (num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon) + (num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen)\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms})\")\nprint(\"Basis Set: 6-31G\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"\\nTotal number of contracted functions calculation:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"= {num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon} + {num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"= {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
