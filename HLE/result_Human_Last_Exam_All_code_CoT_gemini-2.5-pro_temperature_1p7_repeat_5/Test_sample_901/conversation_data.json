    "My plan to solve this organic chemistry problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, which is a strong, bulky base. These conditions are classic for an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Requirements**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the proton to be abstracted must be in an *anti-periplanar* orientation. In a cyclohexane ring, this translates to a *trans-diaxial* arrangement (both groups must be in axial positions, one pointing up and one pointing down).\n3.  **Draw and Analyze Chair Conformations**: I will determine the relationship between the bromo and methyl groups based on the (1S, 2R) stereochemistry, which indicates they are *trans*. I will then draw the two corresponding chair conformations.\n    *   **Conformation A**: Br (equatorial), CH3 (equatorial). This is the more stable conformer.\n    *   **Conformation B**: Br (axial), CH3 (axial). This is the less stable conformer.\n4.  **Identify the Reactive Conformation**: Elimination can only proceed from the conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial. Therefore, Conformation B is the reactive species, even though it's less stable and exists in a lower concentration at equilibrium.\n5.  **Determine the Product**: In the reactive conformation (Br axial), I will look for anti-periplanar (i.e., axial) protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **On C2**: The methyl group is axial, meaning the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. There is no axial hydrogen on C2, so a double bond cannot form between C1 and C2.\n    *   **On C6**: This carbon has an axial hydrogen which is perfectly positioned (trans-diaxial) for elimination with the axial bromine.\n6.  **Conclude**: Elimination will occur by removing the proton from C6, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group remains on C2. The resulting product is named 3-methylcyclohexene. The bulky base also favors this \"Hofmann\" (less substituted) product, but the stereochemistry of the substrate is the deciding factor here.\n\nI will now generate the Python code to explain this process and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes an E2 reaction and identifies the major product.\n    This function will explain the step-by-step chemical reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Reaction\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Reactant: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane (a secondary alkyl halide)\")\n    print(\"Reagent: Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\")\n    print(\"This combination of a secondary halide and a strong, non-nucleophilic base points to an E2 elimination reaction.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reactions\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The E2 mechanism requires the leaving group (Br) and the abstracted proton (H) to be in an 'anti-periplanar' or 'trans-diaxial' arrangement.\")\n    print(\"This means one must be axial-up and the other must be axial-down on adjacent carbons.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the Reactant's Conformations\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The stereochemistry (1S,2R) means the Bromo group and Methyl group are trans to each other.\")\n    print(\"The molecule exists in an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\")\n    print(\"  a) More stable conformer: Bromine (equatorial) and Methyl (equatorial).\")\n    print(\"  b) Less stable conformer: Bromine (axial) and Methyl (axial).\")\n    print(\"\\nFor E2 to occur, the Bromine MUST be in an axial position.
