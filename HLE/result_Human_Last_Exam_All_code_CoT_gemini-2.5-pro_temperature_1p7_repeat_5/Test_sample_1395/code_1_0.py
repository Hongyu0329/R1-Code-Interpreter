# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# Before the dissolution, the presence of a single large USSR node resulted in a less constrained graph.
# We will model this with a chromatic number of 3.
chromatic_number_before = 3

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph after the Soviet dissolution.
# The creation of several new, interconnected Central Asian states increased the graph's complexity.
# As per the Four Color Theorem for complex maps, we assume the chromatic number became 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4

# Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the incremental change in the chromatic number.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The change in chromatic number (delta_soviet) is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}")

# Step 4: Determine beta, the factor for planarity change.
# A graph of countries sharing borders is always planar. The dissolution did not change this fundamental property.
# The problem states to use 1 if planarity did not change.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the country graph did not change, so beta = {beta}")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result by multiplying beta and delta_soviet.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer (beta * delta_soviet) is {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")

print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
