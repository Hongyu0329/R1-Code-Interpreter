    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the specific details of the scene you've described: a teenager, a pink bike, and the action of pedaling directly toward an oncoming car in a major Hollywood film. While the detail of a \"pink bike\" is very specific, it's possible it could be a misremembered color. I will prioritize the most iconic scene that matches the core action. The scene that most famously matches this description, despite a minor discrepancy in the bike's color (it's reddish-orange, not pink), is from the 2004 cult classic *Napoleon Dynamite*. In the film, the main character, Napoleon, confronts his brother Kip, who is driving an orange van, by riding his bike directly at the vehicle.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the movie based on a specific scene description.\n    \n    Scene: A teenager on a bike pedals towards an oncoming car.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The movie is the 2004 film \"Napoleon Dynamite\".\n    # While the bike is reddish-orange rather than pink, the scene is iconic and matches the rest of the description.\n    # The teenager is Napoleon, and the car is his brother Kip's van.\n    movie_title = \"Napoleon Dynamite\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Hollywood feature film where a teenager pedals a bike toward an oncoming vehicle is: {movie_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
