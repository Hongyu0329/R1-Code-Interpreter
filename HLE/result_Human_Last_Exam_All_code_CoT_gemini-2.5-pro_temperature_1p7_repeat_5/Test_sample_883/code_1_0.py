    print("Conclusion: Since the activator's effect is completely nullified and the rate matches the inhibitor's rate, Al1 and Al2 likely compete for the same allosteric binding site.")

    print("\nStep 3: Determine the function of Rga1.")
    print(f"With Rga1, the kcat drops to {rga1_kcat}/s.")
    print(f"When excess substrate is added in the presence of Rga1, the kcat remains at {rga1_high_substrate_kcat}/s.")

    print("\nStep 4: Contrast Rga1 with XAG1 to confirm.")
    print(f"With XAG1, kcat is {xag1_kcat}/s. With XAG1 and high substrate, kcat recovers to {xag1_high_substrate_kcat}/s (close to the control of {control_kcat}/s).")

    print("- Rga1's mode of inhibition is consistent with an irreversible inhibitor.")

    print("- Choice C correctly identifies Al1/Al2 as allosteric modulators, states they bind the same site, and calls Rga1 an irreversible inhibitor.")
