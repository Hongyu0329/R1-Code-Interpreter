    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group Structure**: First, I need to understand the structure of the generalized quaternion group of size 128, which is denoted as $Q_{128}$. This group is defined by the presentation $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. The key components are the maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64 and the element $y$ of order 4.\n\n2.  **Analyze Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be written as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. I'll analyze what happens for different types of $k$.\n\n3.  **Handle Odd Exponents**: I will analyze the case where the exponent $k$ is odd. I'll show that for any odd $k$, the set of $k$-th powers of all elements in $Q_{128}$ is the entire group $Q_{128}$ itself. This gives us one unique power subgroup.\n\n4.  **Handle Even Exponents**: Next, I will analyze the case where the exponent $k$ is even. I'll demonstrate that for any even $k$, the resulting power subgroup $G^k$ is a cyclic subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$. Specifically, it will be of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$, where $d$ is an even divisor of 64.\n\n5.  **Count the Subgroups**: I will count the number of distinct subgroups found in the previous steps.\n    *   There is 1 subgroup from the odd exponent case ($Q_{128}$).\n    *   For the even exponent case, I need to count how many distinct even divisors the number 64 has. Each of these divisors corresponds to a unique power subgroup.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation and Code**: Finally, I'll sum the counts from both cases to get the total number of power subgroups. I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the \n    generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The generalized quaternion group Q_128 has a maximal cyclic subgroup <x>\n    # of order 64.
