    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a d=3 system using the epsilon expansion, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Epsilon (ϵ) Parameter**: The epsilon expansion is a perturbative technique used in renormalization group theory to calculate critical exponents near the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. For the class of models describing systems like ferromagnets and liquid-gas transitions (the φ⁴ theory), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n2.  **State the Formula for α**: The formula for the specific heat exponent `α`, calculated to the first order in `ϵ`, is given by:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n    Here, `n` is the number of components of the order parameter.\n3.  **Determine the Value of n**: The problem does not specify the universality class (i.e., the value of `n`). In such cases, it is standard to assume the most fundamental case, which is the **Ising model**, where the order parameter is a simple scalar. For the Ising model, `n = 1`.\n4.  **Calculate the Result**: We will now substitute the values `d = 3`, `d_c = 4`, and `n = 1` into the formulas.\n    *   `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`\n    *   `α = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) * 1 = 3 / (2 * 9) * 1 = 3 / 18 = 1/6`\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the steps involved.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion\n    for d=3, assuming the Ising universality class (n=1).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
