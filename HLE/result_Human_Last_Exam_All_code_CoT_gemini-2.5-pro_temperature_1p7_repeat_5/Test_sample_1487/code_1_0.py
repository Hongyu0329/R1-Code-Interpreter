# --- Derivation Summary ---
# We are asked to compute: E = (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# From the problem statement, we derive ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1).
# Substituting this into the expression E:
# E = (2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# E = ((pi^2/6 - 1) / (pi^2/6 - 1)) + 10^15
# E = 1 + 10^15
# The exact result is 1000000000000001.

# --- Numerical Confirmation ---
# The following code verifies this result numerically.

# Let's define the parts of the equation.
# part1: The numerator, 2 * ||alpha||^2
# part2: The denominator, (pi^2/6 - 1)
# part3: The constant term, 10^15

# Calculate the value of part2
part2 = (math.pi**2 / 6) - 1

# Calculate ||alpha||^2 based on part2
norm_alpha_sq = 0.5 * part2

# Calculate the value of part1
part1 = 2 * norm_alpha_sq

# Define part3
part3 = 10**15

# Assemble the equation with the calculated numerical values as requested
print("The problem is to evaluate the expression: (part1 / part2) + part3")

print("\nSo, the final equation with numerical values is:")

# Compute the final result
