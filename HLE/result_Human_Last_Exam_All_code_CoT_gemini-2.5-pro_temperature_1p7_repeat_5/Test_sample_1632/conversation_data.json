    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The task is to find `a(10)`, which represents the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square (Manhattan) lattice. A self-avoiding walk is a path on the lattice that starts at the origin and never visits the same point twice.\n\n2.  **Choose a Method**: This is a classic counting problem in computational physics and combinatorics. A direct enumeration of all possible paths is feasible for a relatively small number of steps like `n=10`. I will use a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n\n3.  **Algorithm Details**:\n    *   I'll define a recursive function, let's call it `backtrack(steps_left, current_position, visited_points)`.\n    *   The function will explore paths from the `current_position`.\n    *   `visited_points` will be a set containing the coordinates of all points in the current path, allowing for efficient checking of self-intersections.\n    *   **Base Case**: If `steps_left` is 0, it means we have successfully found a valid 10-step walk. The function returns 1.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: The function tries to move in each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right). For each direction, it checks if the new position has already been visited. If not, it makes a recursive call for that new position with `steps_left - 1`.\n    *   The total number of walks is the sum of the results from all valid recursive calls.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script that implements this backtracking algorithm. The script will calculate the value of `a(10)` and print the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's good practice to increase the recursion limit for deep recursion,\n# though it's not strictly necessary for n=10.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n\n    def backtrack(steps_left, pos, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n        Args:\n            steps_left: The number of remaining steps in the walk.\n            pos: The current (x, y) position on the lattice.\n            visited: A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n\n        Returns:\n            The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one valid walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        x, y = pos\n        \n        # Define the four possible moves from the current position.\n        moves = [(x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)]\n\n        for next_pos in moves:\n            # Check if the next position has already been visited.\n            if next_pos not in visited:\n                # If not visited, proceed with the walk from the new position.\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                count += backtrack(steps_left - 1, next_pos, visited)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to explore other paths.\n                visited.remove(next_pos)\n        \n        return count\n\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0, 0).\n    start_pos = (0, 0)\n    # The initial set of visited points contains only the origin.\n    visited = {start_pos}\n    \n    # Start the backtracking process.\n    result = backtrack(n, start_pos, visited)\n    \n    # Print the final result in the format a(n) = result.\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
