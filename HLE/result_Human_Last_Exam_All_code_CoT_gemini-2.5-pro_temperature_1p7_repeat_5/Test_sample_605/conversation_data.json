    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we must identify all monomials in the defining polynomial that consist of a power of a single variable (i.e., terms of the form $z_i^k$). The invariant is then the sum of the weights ($w_i$) corresponding to these specific variables.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will verify that the provided polynomial is indeed for a Calabi-Yau manifold. This involves checking if the polynomial is quasi-homogeneous and if its weighted degree equals the sum of the weights. My preliminary check shows that the sum of weights is $22+29+49+50+75=225$. All monomials have a weighted degree of 225, except for $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, which has a degree of 224 and is likely a typo. However, since this term involves multiple variables, this discrepancy does not affect the calculation of the invariant.\n2.  I will write a Python script that parses the polynomial string into its individual monomial terms.\n3.  The script will then examine each term to determine if it is a pure power of a single variable.\n4.  For each pure power term found, the script will identify the corresponding variable and its weight.\n5.  Finally, it will sum these weights and print the final calculation, clearly showing which weights contributed to the sum.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n    The invariant is the sum of the weights of variables that appear as\n    pure power monomials (e.g., z_i^k) in the defining polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial defining the Calabi-Yau Link\n    polynomial = \"z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3\"\n\n    # The weights of the variables (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5)\n    weights = {\n        '1': 22,\n        '2': 29,\n        '3': 49,\n        '4': 50,\n        '5': 75\n    }\n\n    # Split the polynomial into its monomial terms\n    terms = polynomial.split('+')\n\n    # A regular expression to find all variable indices (the 'i' in z_i) in a term\n    variable_pattern = re.compile(r'z_(\\d+)')\n\n    contributing_weights = []\n    pure_power_variables = []\n\n    # Analyze each term to see if it's a pure power of a single variable\n    for term in terms:\n        # Find all variables present in the current term\n        variables_in_term = set(variable_pattern.findall(term))\n\n        # A pure power monomial will only contain one unique variable\n        if len(variables_in_term) == 1:\n            var_index = variables_in_term.pop()\n            contributing_weights.append(weights[var_index])\n            pure_power_variables.append(f\"z_{var_index}\")\n    \n    # Calculate the invariant by summing the collected weights\n    invariant_value = sum(contributing_weights)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final result in an equation format\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is the sum of the weights of variables\")\n    print(\"that appear as pure power monomials in the polynomial.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    if not contributing_weights:\n        print(\"No pure power monomials found.\")\n        print(\"The invariant is 0.\")\n        print(\"0 = 0\")\n    else:\n        weights_str = \" + \".join(map(str, contributing_weights))\n        variables_str = \", \".join(pure_power_variables)\n        print(f\"The pure power monomial(s) correspond to the variable(s): {variables_str}.\")\n        print(f\"The respective weight(s) are: {', '.join(map(str, contributing_weights))}.\")\n        print(\"\\nThe resulting sum is:\")\n        print(f\"{weights_str} = {invariant_value}\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```\n<<<75>>>"
