    print("Trisyllabic Laxing is a rule that shortens a long vowel when it occurs in the third-to-last syllable of a word.")

    # Serenity
    print("\nWord: serenity (se-ren-i-ty)")
    print("  - Related word: serene (long /iː/ vowel)")
    print("  - In 'serenity', the vowel in the third-to-last syllable ('ren') is short /ɛ/.")
    print("  - Result: This word HAS undergone trisyllabic laxing.")
    # Derivative
    print("\nWord: derivative (de-riv-a-tive)")
    print("  - Related word: derive (long /aɪ/ diphthong)")
    print("  - In 'derivative', the vowel in the third-to-last syllable ('riv') is short /ɪ/.")
    print("  - Result: This word HAS undergone trisyllabic laxing.")
    # Gratitude
    print("\nWord: gratitude (grat-i-tude)")
    print("  - Related word: grate (long /eɪ/ diphthong)")
    print("  - In 'gratitude', the vowel in the third-to-last syllable ('grat') is short /æ/.")
    print("  - Result: This word HAS undergone trisyllabic laxing.")

    print("\nStep 3: Examining words with two syllables")
    print("These words ('southern', 'pleasant', 'shadow') cannot undergo TRIsyllabic laxing by definition, as they lack a third-to-last syllable.")
    print("To find the one correct answer, we check if they underwent other kinds of vowel shortening (laxing).")
    # Southern
    print("\nWord: southern")
    print("  - Related word: south (long /aʊ/ diphthong)")
    print("  - The vowel shortens to /ʌ/ in 'southern'. This is a form of laxing.")
    # Pleasant
    print("\nWord: pleasant")
    print("  - Related word: please (long /iː/ vowel)")
    print("  - The vowel shortens to /ɛ/ in 'pleasant'. This is also a form of laxing.")
    # Shadow
    print("\nWord: shadow")
    print("  - Related word: shade (long /eɪ/ diphthong)")
    print("  - Historical analysis shows the vowel in 'shadow' was never long. Instead, the vowel in its relative 'shade' was LENGTHENED over time (due to being in an open syllable).")
