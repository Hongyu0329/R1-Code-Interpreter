# This problem involves concepts from set theory and cardinal arithmetic.
# To find a definite answer, we work under the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH).

# 1. Determine the minimal and maximal cardinalities of branches.
# Let aleph_n be represented by its index 'n'.
# The minimal cardinality, |T1|, is omega_2 = aleph_2.
min_cardinal_index = 2

# The maximal cardinality, |T2|, is aleph_0^aleph_2.
# Under GCH, this evaluates to aleph_3.
max_cardinal_index = 3

# 2. Count the number of cardinals in the interval [|T1|, |T2|].
# This corresponds to counting the number of integers in the index interval.
# The cardinals in the interval [aleph_2, aleph_3] are aleph_2 and aleph_3.
number_of_cardinalities = max_cardinal_index - min_cardinal_index + 1

# 3. Print the step-by-step reasoning for the final calculation.

print("Assuming the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH):")
print(f"The minimal cardinality |T1| is omega_2, which is aleph_{min_cardinal_index}.")
print(f"The maximal cardinality |T2| is aleph_0^aleph_2, which is aleph_{max_cardinal_index} under GCH.")
print(f"So, the interval is [aleph_{min_cardinal_index}, aleph_{max_cardinal_index}].")
print("The cardinal numbers in this interval are aleph_2 and aleph_3.")
print("The number of such cardinalities is the number of integers in the interval of their indices.")
print(f"Calculation: {max_cardinal_index} - {min_cardinal_index} + 1 = {number_of_cardinalities}")
