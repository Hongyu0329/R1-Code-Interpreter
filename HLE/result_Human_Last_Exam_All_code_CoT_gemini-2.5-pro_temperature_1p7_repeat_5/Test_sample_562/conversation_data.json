    "My plan is to first identify the radical for the character \"謄\", find its Japanese name, and then provide its Hepburn transcription.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character**: The Japanese character \"謄\" (tō) is composed of two parts: 言 on the left and 朕 on the right.\n2.  **Identify the Radical**: In characters with a left-right structure, the left part is typically the radical used for dictionary indexing. In this case, the radical is \"言\".\n3.  **Find the Radical's Name**: The radical \"言\" has a specific name when it appears on the left side of a character (a position known as *hen* or *ben*). Its name is ごんべん (gonben).\n4.  **Transcribe to Hepburn**: The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a simple Python script to print the character and its corresponding radical name.\n\n```python\ndef find_kanji_radical():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the character 謄 and prints its name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The target character.\n    character = '謄'\n    \n    # The radical for 謄 is 言.\n    # When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is called \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n    # \"Gonben\" is the Hepburn transcription.\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n\n    print(f\"The bushu (radical) in the Japanese character '{character}' is '{radical_name_hepburn}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_kanji_radical()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
