print("The goal is to identify the best counseling points for a mother whose 16-year-old son is vaping.")

print("\nStep 1: Analyze the core principle of adolescent nicotine use.")
print("For adolescents, the clinical goal is always complete cessation of all nicotine products (cigarettes, vapes, etc.). The risks to the developing brain and lungs are significant, and early nicotine use leads to a high risk of lifelong addiction. This is different from the harm reduction strategy that vaping might represent for an adult long-term smoker.")

print("\nStep 2: Evaluate each statement.")
print("I: Incorrect. It is not 'ok' for an adolescent to continue vaping. This normalizes nicotine use in youth.")
print("II: Correct. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) like patches or gum is a valid, evidence-based tool to aid in cessation by managing withdrawal. It is a key therapeutic option to consider.")
print("III: Correct. This statement correctly differentiates the risk profile for adults and children and establishes the proper goal: the son 'should not vape at all'. This is a crucial educational point for the parent.")
print("IV: Incorrect. Phrasing vaping as having 'clear benefits' for children is misleading and undermines the message of cessation.")
print("V: Correct as a consideration. Bupropion and varenicline are second-line prescription medication options that a clinician might consider for an adolescent, but NRT (II) is typically a first-line discussion.")

print("\nStep 3: Determine the best combination of counseling points.")
print("The most effective counseling combines education on the risks with a clear plan of action. Therefore, combining Statement III (the 'why') and Statement II (the 'how') is the most comprehensive and appropriate initial approach.")
print("This educates the mother on why her experience doesn't apply to her son and provides a concrete, first-line therapeutic strategy to help him quit.")

print("\nStep 4: Final Answer Equation.")
print("The best combination includes statements II and III.")
print("Selected Options = II + III")
print("This corresponds to answer choice J in the list.")
