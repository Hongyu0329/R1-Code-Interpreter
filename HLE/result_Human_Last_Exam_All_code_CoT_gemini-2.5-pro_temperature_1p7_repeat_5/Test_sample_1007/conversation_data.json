    "To solve this problem, I will analyze the definition of each ballet step to determine its starting and ending leg positions. The goal is to find the step that concludes in the same position it began.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  I will create a data structure in Python, specifically a dictionary, to store information about each ballet step listed in the answer choices.\n2.  For each step, this data structure will hold a boolean value indicating whether the step ends in the same position it starts (`ends_same_position: True`) or a different one (`ends_same_position: False`).\n3.  The program will then iterate through this data structure.\n4.  It will identify the step for which `ends_same_position` is `True`.\n5.  Finally, it will print the name of the correct step along with an explanation of why it is the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to identify which one has the same\n    starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A database of ballet steps and their properties.\n    # The key 'ends_same_position' is True if the starting and ending\n    # positions of the feet are identical (e.g., right foot front in fifth\n    # at the start and right foot front in fifth at the end).\n    ballet_steps = {\n        \"A.
