# The plan is to identify the two swapped lines based on a subtle break in the poem's form.
# The primary sestina pattern of end-words is intact.
# The break is in a secondary pattern, an anaphora (repetition of a phrase).
# Lines 28 and 29 originally formed an anaphora with "Long since".
# Line 29 was likely swapped with line 58, which has the same end-word ("evening")
# but does not start with "Long since", thus breaking the pattern.

line_x = 29
line_y = 58

print(f"The two swapped lines are {line_x} and {line_y}.")
