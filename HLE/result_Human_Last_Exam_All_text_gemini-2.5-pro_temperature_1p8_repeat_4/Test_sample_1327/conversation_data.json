    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple pattern.**\nLet's start by checking the differences between consecutive terms.\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no immediately obvious arithmetic or geometric pattern here.\n\n**Step 3: Explore other relationships, such as multiplication.**\nLet's see if each term is related to the previous term by multiplication and then addition/subtraction. A common pattern is `Next Term = k * Previous Term + Constant`. Let's try `k=2`.\n*   From 2 to 11: 2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n*   From 11 to 23: 2 * 11 + 1 = 23\n*   From 23 to 51: 2 * 23 + 5 = 51\n*   From 51 to 119: 2 * 51 + 17 = 119\n\n**Step 4: Identify the pattern in the added numbers.**\nThe general rule seems to be: `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + C`, where `C` is a number that changes with each step.\nThe sequence of the added numbers (let's call it the `C` sequence) is: 7, 1, 5, 17.\nThe first term, 7, seems out of place compared to the others. Let's focus on the pattern starting from the second added number: 1, 5, 17.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the `C` sequence (1, 5, 17).**\nLet's find the differences between the terms in this new sequence.\n*   5 - 1 = 4\n*   17 - 5 = 12\nThe differences are 4 and 12. We can see a clear pattern here: each difference is 3 times the previous one (4 * 3 = 12). This is a geometric progression.\n\n**Step 6: Predict the next term in the `C` sequence.**\nFollowing the pattern, the next difference should be 12 * 3 = 36.\nSo, the next term in the `C` sequence will be the last term (17) plus this new difference (36).\nNext C term = 17 + 36 = 53.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the missing number in the original sequence.**\nNow we can apply our rule to find the number in the parentheses.\n*   Previous Term = 119\n*   Rule: Next Term = 2 * Previous Term + Next C term\n*   Next Term = 2 * 119 + 53\n*   Next Term = 238 + 53\n*   Next Term = 291\n\nThe missing number in the sequence is 291.\n\n**Final check of the options:**\nA. 291\nB. 285\nC. 171\nD. 167\nOur calculated answer, 291, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
