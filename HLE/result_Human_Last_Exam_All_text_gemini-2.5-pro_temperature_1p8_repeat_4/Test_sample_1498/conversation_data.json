    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\nThe user wants to know the specific range of couplets (in Arabic, a couplet is a *bayt*, plural *abyat*) within the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the names of the Prophets are listed.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Poem and its Structure**\nThe poem is *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. It's a short, famous poem (around 57 couplets) that outlines the essential articles of faith in Islam. One of these articles is the belief in the Prophets and Messengers. The poem dedicates a specific section to list the 25 prophets whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an.\n\n**Step 3: Locating the Introductory Verse**\nBefore listing the names, the author provides an introduction. In most standard editions of the poem, this is **Bayt 29**.\n\n*   **Bayt 29:**\n    > تفصيلُ خَمسَةٍ وعِشرينَ لَزِمْ *** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    > *Translation: The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every legally responsible person, so ascertain this and benefit.*\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This couplet is *about* the prophets to be named, but it does not contain their names. Therefore, it is not the starting point of the list itself, but the preface to it.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Start of the List**\nThe enumeration of the Prophets' names begins in the very next couplet, **Bayt 30**.\n\n*   **Bayt 30:**\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ *** صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    > *Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih, and Ibrahim; each one is to be followed.*\n\n*   **Analysis:** This is the first couplet that explicitly lists the names. This marks the beginning of the range.\n\n**Step 5: Tracing the Continuation of the List**\nThe list of names continues over the subsequent couplets.\n\n*   **Bayt 31:** Lists Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n*   **Bayt 32:** Lists Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa', Dhu'l-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n**Step 6: Identifying the End of the List**\nThe list of names is completed in **Bayt 33**.\n\n*   **Bayt 33:**\n    > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    > *Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the final one - leave misguidance.*\n\n*   **Analysis:** This couplet mentions the final prophets in the list of 25, concluding with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (referred to by one of his names, Taha). This marks the end of the range.\n\n**Step 7: Analyzing the Concluding Verse**\nThe couplet that follows, **Bayt 34**, is a supplication for all the prophets mentioned.\n\n*   **Bayt 34:**\n    > عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ *** وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n    > *Translation: Upon them be peace and blessings, and upon their families, for as long as days last.*\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Similar to the introductory verse, this couplet refers to the prophets collectively but does not list any names. Therefore, the list itself has already concluded in the previous couplet.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe names of the prophets are explicitly mentioned starting from Bayt 30 and ending at Bayt 33.\n\n<<<From Bayt 30 to Bayt 33.>>>"
