    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Graph Structure**\n\n*   **Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph is constructed from two identical complete graphs connected by a single edge.\n*   **Parameters:** The problem specifies a barbell graph with 10 nodes. This means it consists of two complete graphs (`K_n`) connected by a bridge. The total number of nodes is `2n = 10`, which implies each complete graph has `n=5` nodes. So, we have two `K_5` cliques.\n*   **Cliques:** Let's call the two cliques `C_L` (left) and `C_R` (right). Each `C_L` and `C_R` is a `K_5`, a graph where every node is connected to every other node within that clique.\n*   **Bottleneck Edge:** This is the single edge that connects the two cliques. Let's say it connects node `u` in `C_L` to node `v` in `C_R`. This edge, `(u, v)`, is the bottleneck.\n*   **Uniform Weights:** All edges have the same weight. This simplifies the problem, as the selection probability for neighbors will be uniform and not dependent on edge weights.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Node Degrees**\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We need to find the degrees for the different types of nodes in the graph.\n\n*   **Bridge Nodes:** These are the two nodes (`u` and `v`) that form the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Each bridge node is connected to `n-1` other nodes within its own `K_5` clique. Here, `n-1 = 5-1 = 4`.\n    *   Each bridge node is also connected to the other bridge node via the bottleneck edge. This adds 1 to its degree.\n    *   So, the degree of each bridge node is `d(u) = d(v) = (5-1) + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Internal Nodes:** These are all the other nodes in the graph that are not part of the bottleneck edge.\n    *   There are `5 - 1 = 4` internal nodes in `C_L` and `4` internal nodes in `C_R`, for a total of 8 internal nodes.\n    *   Each internal node is only connected to the other `n-1 = 4` nodes within its own clique.\n    *   So, the degree of each internal node is `4`.\n\n**Summary of Node Degrees:**\n*   2 nodes (the bridge nodes) have a degree of 5.\n*   8 nodes (the internal nodes) have a degree of 4.\n\n### **Step 3: Defining the Sampling Process**\n\n*   **Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** This protocol typically involves a two-step random process in each round:\n    1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all nodes in the graph.\n    2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random.\n*   The edge between the initially selected node and its chosen neighbor is the \"sampled\" edge for that round.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Probability**\n\nWe want to find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge `e_b = (u, v)`. This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n\n1.  **Start at node `u`:** We select node `u` first, and then it selects its neighbor `v`.\n    *   The probability of selecting node `u` from the 10 total nodes is `P(select u) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given that `u` is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor `v` is `1 / d(u)`. Since `d(u) = 5`, this probability is `1/5`.\n    *   The total probability for this case is: `P(u → v) = P(select u) * P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n2.  **Start at node `v`:** We select node `v` first, and then it selects its neighbor `u`.\n    *   The probability of selecting node `v` from the 10 total nodes is `P(select v) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given that `v` is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor `u` is `1 / d(v)`. Since `d(v) = 5`, this probability is `1/5`.\n    *   The total probability for this case is: `P(v → u) = P(select v) * P(v chooses u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n**Final Probability:**\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two exclusive events.\n`P(sample e_b) = P(u → v) + P(v → u) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\n### **Summary of Careful Points**\n*   Correctly determine the graph's topology (two `K_5`s connected by one edge).\n*   Accurately calculate the degrees of both the bridge nodes (degree 5) and the internal nodes (degree 4).\n*   Use the standard model for randomized uniform gossiping: select a node uniformly, then a neighbor uniformly.\n*   Remember that the undirected edge `(u, v)` can be sampled via two directed paths, `u → v` and `v → u`. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n*   The information about \"uniform weights\" confirms that the neighbor selection is unweighted.\n\nThe final answer is the fraction `1/25`, which can also be expressed as the decimal `0.04`.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
