The analytical solution is the implicit relationship for the normalized density $\bar{\rho} = \rho/\rho_0$ as a function of the normalized position $\tilde{x}=x/L$: $\frac{2(\bar{\rho}-1)^6}{\bar{\rho}^5(2-\bar{\rho})} = C \exp\left(\frac{20}{3}\tilde{x}\right)$, where $C$ is an integration constant that depends on the choice of origin.
