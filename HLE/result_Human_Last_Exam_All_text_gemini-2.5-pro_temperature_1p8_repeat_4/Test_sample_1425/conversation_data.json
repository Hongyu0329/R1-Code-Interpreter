    "This problem asks for the partition function $Z$ of a specific system in the grand canonical ensemble, calculated using the path integral formalism. We will analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Ensemble**\n\n*   **Grand Canonical Ensemble:** This ensemble describes a system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir. The system is characterized by its volume $V$, temperature $T$, and chemical potential $\\mu$.\n*   **Partition Function (Z):** The partition function in this ensemble is given by the trace over the full Fock space (space of all possible particle numbers):\n    $Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\n    where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian (kinetic + potential energy), and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   **The Given Hamiltonian:** The problem states the Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. This is an unconventional notation. The most standard interpretation is that the quantity in the exponent of the density matrix is being specified. That is, the system has no intrinsic dynamics (kinetic or potential energy), so $\\hat{H}_{sys} = 0$. The full operator in the grand canonical exponent is thus $\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N} = 0 - \\mu\\hat{N} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n*   **Final Operator Form:** Based on this interpretation, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right] = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{\\beta \\mu \\hat{N}} \\right]$\n\n**2. Formulate the Path Integral**\n\nThe path integral formalism is a method to compute such traces. The trace is expressed as an integral over all possible field histories (\"paths\").\n\n*   **Euclidean Action (S_E):** The operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}}$ (where $\\hat{K}$ is the operator in the exponent) corresponds to a path integral with a Euclidean action $S_E$:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S_E[\\phi^*, \\phi]}$\n    where $\\phi$ are fields representing the particles (complex fields for bosons, Grassmann fields for fermions).\n*   **Deriving the Action:** The standard derivation for a Hamiltonian $\\hat{K}$ leads to an action of the form $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, (\\phi^*\\partial_\\tau\\phi + K(\\phi^*,\\phi))$, where $K(\\phi^*,\\phi)$ is the coherent state expectation value of the normal-ordered operator $\\hat{K}$.\n    In our case, the operator is $e^{\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}}$, which can be seen as an evolution with a \"Hamiltonian\" $\\hat{K} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. The number operator in second quantization is $\\hat{N} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x}) \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n    Its normal-ordered symbol is $N(\\phi^*, \\phi) = \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^*(\\mathbf{x}) \\phi(\\mathbf{x})$.\n    Thus, $K(\\phi^*,\\phi) = -\\mu \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^*(\\mathbf{x}) \\phi(\\mathbf{x})$.\n*   **The Resulting Action:** Plugging this into the general form, our specific Euclidean action is:\n    $S_E[\\phi^*, \\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ \\phi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) - \\mu \\, \\phi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\right]$\n    We can rewrite this as:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n\n**3. Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe action is quadratic in the fields, making the path integral a Gaussian integral. We evaluate it by diagonalizing the operator $(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$ in Fourier space.\n\n*   **Fourier Expansion:** We expand the fields in terms of Fourier modes, with wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$ for space and Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n$ for imaginary time $\\tau$.\n    $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V\\beta}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, \\omega_n} e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} - \\omega_n \\tau)} \\phi_{\\mathbf{k},n}$\n*   **Action in Fourier Space:** In this basis, the operator $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes a sum over uncoupled modes:\n    $S_E = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, \\omega_n} \\phi_{\\mathbf{k},n}^* (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\phi_{\\mathbf{k},n}$\n*   **The Gaussian Integral:** The path integral becomes a product of integrals over each mode:\n    $Z = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}, \\omega_n} \\int d\\phi_{\\mathbf{k},n}^* d\\phi_{\\mathbf{k},n} \\exp\\left[ -(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\phi_{\\mathbf{k},n}^* \\phi_{\\mathbf{k},n} \\right]$\n    The result depends on the statistics of the particles.\n\n**4. Distinguish Bosons and Fermions**\n\n*   **Fermions:** The fields $\\phi$ are Grassmann variables. For a single Grassmann mode, the integral is $\\int d\\psi^* d\\psi e^{-A\\psi^*\\psi} = A$. The partition function is the determinant of the operator in the action:\n    $Z_F = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}, \\omega_n} (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) = \\text{Det}(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$\n    The Matsubara frequencies for fermions are $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$.\n\n*   **Bosons:** The fields $\\phi$ are standard complex variables. For a single complex mode, the integral is $\\int \\frac{d\\phi_R d\\phi_I}{\\pi} e^{-A(\\phi_R^2+\\phi_I^2)} = 1/A$. The partition function is the inverse of the determinant:\n    $Z_B = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}, \\omega_n} \\frac{1}{(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)} = [\\text{Det}(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1}$\n    The Matsubara frequencies for bosons are $\\omega_n = 2n\\pi/\\beta$.\n\n**5. Final Evaluation and Connection to the Trace Method**\n\nThe product over Matsubara frequencies is formally divergent and requires regularization. Standard techniques for these infinite products yield:\n*   For fermions: $\\prod_n (-i\\omega_n - E) \\propto 1+e^{-\\beta E}$\n*   For bosons: $\\prod_n (-i\\omega_n - E) \\propto 1-e^{-\\beta E}$\n(These results are obtained up to regularization-dependent factors related to the vacuum energy).\n\nIn our problem, the operator is $(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$, which corresponds to an \"energy\" $E = \\mu$. A more careful analysis identifies $E=-\\mu$. Using $E=-\\mu$:\n\n*   **Fermions:** $Z_F \\propto \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} (1+e^{-\\beta(-\\mu)}) = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} (1+e^{\\beta\\mu})$.\n*   **Bosons:** $Z_B \\propto \\left[ \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} (1-e^{-\\beta(-\\mu)}) \\right]^{-1} = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} (1-e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$.\n\nThese results from the path integral formalism exactly match the results from a direct calculation of the trace, $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}}]$, in the occupation number basis. The direct trace calculation is simpler and avoids the subtleties of regularization.\n\n*   For a single mode $\\mathbf{k}$, the trace is $\\sum_{n_k} (e^{\\beta\\mu})^{n_k}$.\n*   For fermions, occupations are $n_k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, so the sum is $1+e^{\\beta\\mu}$.\n*   For bosons, occupations are $n_k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$, so the sum is a geometric series $\\frac{1}{1-e^{\\beta\\mu}}$ (which requires $|e^{\\beta\\mu}|<1$, i.e., $\\mu<0$, for convergence).\n\nThe total partition function is the product over all single-particle modes $\\{\\mathbf{k}\\}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles. The sum $\\mathbf{k}$ runs over all available single-particle quantum states (e.g., momentum states in a box).\n\n**For a system of Fermions:**\nThe Pauli exclusion principle allows each state $\\mathbf{k}$ to be either empty ($n_k=0$) or occupied by one particle ($n_k=1$). The partition function is the product over all states of the sum over these possibilities:\n$Z_F = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} \\sum_{n_k \\in \\{0,1\\}} (e^{\\beta\\mu})^{n_k} = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n\n**For a system of Bosons:**\nAny number of bosons can occupy a single state $\\mathbf{k}$ ($n_k=0, 1, 2, ...$). The partition function is a product of geometric series:\n$Z_B = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} \\sum_{n_k=0}^{\\infty} (e^{\\beta\\mu})^{n_k} = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\nThis result is physically valid only for chemical potential $\\mu < 0$, which ensures the convergence of the geometric series for each mode.\n\nIf there are $M$ available single-particle states, these expressions become $Z_F = (1+e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$ and $Z_B = (1-e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$.\n\n<<<For fermions, the partition function is $Z_F = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})$. For bosons, the partition function is $Z_B = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$, valid for $\\mu < 0$. Here, the product is over all single-particle states $\\mathbf{k}$.>>>"
