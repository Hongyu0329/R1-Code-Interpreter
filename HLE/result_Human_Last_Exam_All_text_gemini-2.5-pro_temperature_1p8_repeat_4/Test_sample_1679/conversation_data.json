    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Object:** A Luxor Obelisk.\n    *   **Action:** Depicted on-screen.\n    *   **Criteria:** The film must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n    *   **Constraint:** It must be the *first* film to meet all these criteria.\n\n2.  **Identify the Luxor Obelisks:**\n    There are two famous Luxor Obelisks that were originally a pair at the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n    *   One remains at the entrance to the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n    *   The other was transported to France in the 1830s and now stands in the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\n    Therefore, a film could meet the criteria by showing either of these two locations.\n\n3.  **Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners:**\n    We must examine the list of Best Picture winners in chronological order, starting from the first award in 1929, looking for films set in either Paris or Luxor.\n\n    *   **1920s-1930s:** Winners like *Wings* (1929), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930), and *Cavalcade* (1933) are set in Europe, but a detailed look at their scenes shows they do not feature the Place de la Concorde. A strong potential candidate from this era is **_The Life of Emile Zola_ (1937)**, which is set in Paris. However, its key historical scenes, like the degradation of Captain Dreyfus, took place at the Ã‰cole Militaire, not the Place de la Concorde. The film does not feature the obelisk.\n\n    *   **1940s:** This decade includes **_Casablanca_ (1943)**, which famously features flashbacks to Paris. However, these scenes focus on the romance between the lead characters and do not include wide establishing shots or montages of major landmarks like the Place de la Concorde. Other winners of the decade are set elsewhere (e.g., England, the U.S., Denmark).\n\n    *   **1950s:** This decade provides the answer.\n        *   **_An American in Paris_ (1951):** As the title suggests, this film is a love letter to the city of Paris. It features numerous shots, both in live-action montages and in the celebrated 17-minute closing ballet sequence, of Paris's most famous landmarks. The **Place de la Concorde, with its iconic Luxor Obelisk**, is clearly depicted as part of the scenery that defines the city for the main character. This film is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Verifying it's the first:** Are there any other winners after 1951 but before another potential candidate?\n        *   **_Around the World in 80 Days_ (1956):** This film's globe-trotting plot begins with a stop in Paris after leaving London. During the Paris sequence, the film shows the Place de la Concorde and the obelisk. However, since this film won five years *after* _An American in Paris_, it is not the *first*.\n        *   No Best Picture winners from this era are set in Luxor, Egypt, in a way that would depict the obelisk there. Grand epics like _The Ten Commandments_ (1956) or _Cleopatra_ (1963) were set in ancient Egypt but did not win the Best Picture award.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Distinguish between the two obelisks:** The question is valid for the obelisk in Paris as well as the one in Luxor. The Paris location proved to be the relevant one.\n*   **\"Depict\" vs. \"Central to the plot\":** The obelisk did not need to be a plot point, only visually present on-screen. _An American in Paris_ fulfills this by using it as a key part of the Parisian scenery.\n*   **Verify the win:** A film simply being set in Paris or Egypt is not enough; it must have won the Academy Award for *Best Picture*. This rules out many famous films.\n*   **Chronology is key:** The most critical part of the question is \"first.\" This requires checking winners in order until a match is found, disqualifying any later films that also fit the description.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter a chronological review of Best Picture winners, _The Life of Emile Zola_ (1937) is the first winner set in Paris, but it does not show the obelisk. The first winner to clearly depict the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde is the 1951 musical, _An American in Paris_.\n\n<<<An American in Paris"
