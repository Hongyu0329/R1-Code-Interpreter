    "The user wants me to find the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with $n=128$ vertices.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\n1.  **Graph on n=128 vertices:** The universe of objects we are considering are all possible graphs that have exactly 128 vertices. Let $G=(V, E)$ be such a graph, with $|V|=128$.\n\n2.  **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique of size $k$ is often denoted as $K_k$.\n\n3.  **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices $V' \\subseteq V$, the subgraph induced by $V'$, denoted $G[V']$, has vertex set $V'$ and contains an edge between two vertices $u, v \\in V'$ if and only if the edge $(u, v)$ exists in the original graph $G$.\n\n4.  **Clique sizes appearing as induced subgraphs:** The question requires us to find integers $k$ for which there exists a subset of vertices $V_k \\subseteq V$ of size $|V_k|=k$, such that the induced subgraph $G[V_k]$ is a complete graph (a clique).\n\n5.  **Number of different clique sizes:** Let $S(G)$ be the set of all such possible sizes $k$ for a given graph $G$. The question asks for the maximum possible value of $|S(G)|$ (the cardinality of the set $S(G)$) over all possible graphs $G$ with 128 vertices.\n\n### Careful points and interpretation\n\n*   **\"Simultaneously appear\":** This means that for a single chosen graph $G$, we must be able to find all the induced cliques of the specified sizes. It does not imply that these cliques must be vertex-disjoint. If that stronger condition was required, the problem would typically state \"vertex-disjoint induced subgraphs\". In the absence of such a specific constraint, we assume the vertex sets of these cliques are allowed to overlap.\n*   **The structure of the set of clique sizes S(G):** Let's analyze the relationship between different clique sizes within a single graph. Suppose a graph $G$ has an induced clique of size $k_{max}$. This means there is a set of vertices $V_{max}$ of size $k_{max}$ such that every pair of vertices in $V_{max}$ is connected by an edge. Let's consider any integer $k$ such that $1 \\le k < k_{max}$. We can choose any subset $V_k \\subseteq V_{max}$ with $|V_k| = k$. Since every pair of vertices in $V_{max}$ is connected, it follows that every pair of vertices in the subset $V_k$ is also connected. Therefore, the subgraph induced by $V_k$, $G[V_k]$, is a clique of size $k$.\n*   **Conclusion on S(G):** This implies that if a graph $G$ contains an induced clique of size $k_{max}$, it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes $1, 2, \\dots, k_{max}-1$. The size of the largest clique in a graph is known as the clique number, denoted by $\\omega(G)$. So, for any graph $G$, the set of all possible clique sizes is $S(G) = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, \\omega(G)\\}$.\n*   **The problem rephrased:** The number of different clique sizes is therefore $|S(G)| = \\omega(G)$. The question is equivalent to finding the maximum possible clique number, $\\omega(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n=128$ vertices.\n\n### Acquiring the final answer\n\nThe problem is now reduced to solving: What is the maximum value of $\\omega(G)$ for a graph $G$ on 128 vertices?\n\n1.  **Upper Bound:** For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices. So, for $n=128$, we must have $\\omega(G) \\le 128$. This means the number of different clique sizes cannot be more than 128.\n\n2.  **Achievability:** To show that 128 is the maximum possible number, we need to construct a graph $G$ on 128 vertices that achieves this value.\n    *   Consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted $K_{128}$. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n    *   Let's determine the clique number of $K_{128}$. The entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique, so $\\omega(K_{128}) = 128$.\n    *   As established before, the set of all clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs in $K_{128}$ is $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\omega(K_{128})\\}$, which is $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 128\\}$.\n    *   The number of different clique sizes in this graph is 128.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** We have established an upper bound of 128 and shown that this bound is achievable with the complete graph $K_{128}$. Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Alternative Interpretation Check: If the question implied vertex-disjoint cliques for each size, the problem would be to maximize $m$ subject to $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_i \\le 128$ for distinct sizes $k_i$. To maximize $m$, we should choose the smallest distinct positive integers, so $k_i = i$. We would solve for the largest $m$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} i = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} \\le 128$. This yields $m(m+1) \\le 256$. For $m=15$, $15 \\times 16 = 240$; for $m=16$, $16 \\times 17 = 272$. So the maximum would be $m=15$. However, this interpretation is non-standard without explicit mention of disjointness and yields a smaller value than the direct interpretation.)*\n\nThe most direct interpretation of the question leads to the conclusion that the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum clique number in a graph of size 128."
