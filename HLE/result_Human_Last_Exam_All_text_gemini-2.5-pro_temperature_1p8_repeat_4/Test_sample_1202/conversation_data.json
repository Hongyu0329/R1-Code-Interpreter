    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks to identify the mechanism that is **most likely** responsible for two key outcomes following a gene duplication event:\n1.  **Retention:** The duplicate gene is not lost from the genome (i.e., it doesn't become a pseudogene or get deleted).\n2.  **Divergence:** The sequence and/or function of the duplicate gene and the original gene become different over evolutionary time.\n\nThe term \"most likely\" suggests we should look for a common or highly probable pathway for preserving these duplicated genes.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. This mechanism makes the two gene copies more similar, leading to homogenization. It actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, this is not the correct mechanism.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is a very common fate for a duplicated gene. Due to redundancy, one copy is no longer under purifying selection and accumulates mutations that disable its function, turning it into a non-functional pseudogene. While this involves divergence (the gene sequence changes), it results in the *loss* of a functional gene, not its *retention* as a functional copy. The question asks for a mechanism that retains the duplicate.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original, ancestral function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that eventually result in a new, beneficial function. This new function is then favored by natural selection. This model successfully explains both **retention** (the new function is selected for) and **divergence** (the gene evolves a new role). This is a valid and important mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model starts with an ancestral gene that has multiple functions (or is expressed in multiple tissues/times). After duplication, degenerative mutations occur in different subfunctions of the two copies in a complementary way. For example, copy 1 loses function A but keeps function B, while copy 2 loses function B but keeps function A. Now, both copies are required to perform the original set of functions, and losing either copy would be detrimental. This model explains **retention** (both copies are now essential) and **divergence** (they specialize and are no longer identical). This is also a valid and important mechanism.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary term describing the rapid diversification of a group of organisms into a multitude of new forms filling different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a *molecular mechanism* for retaining individual genes within a genome. It operates at the level of species and lineages, not genes.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Most Plausible Options (C and D)\n\nBoth Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are major, accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. The question asks which is \"most likely\".\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** requires the evolution of a brand-new, beneficial function. Such gain-of-function mutations are generally considered to be rare. The duplicate gene is in a \"race\" to find a new function before it is silenced by more common disabling mutations (pseudogenization).\n*   **Subfunctionalization** relies on partitioning existing functions. This can be achieved through relatively common loss-of-function mutations that disable different parts of the gene's function (e.g., in different protein domains or regulatory elements) in each copy. Because the mutations required for subfunctionalization are more common than those for neofunctionalization, many scientists argue that it is a more frequent or probable mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicate genes. It provides a passive \"safe harbor\" from pseudogenization, allowing both copies to be maintained in the genome, where they might later undergo neofunctionalization.\n\nTherefore, because subfunctionalization depends on more common mutational events (degenerative mutations) to preserve both gene copies, it is often considered the **most likely** mechanism for the initial retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nSubfunctionalization provides a highly plausible and common route for preserving both copies of a duplicated gene by partitioning the ancestral functions through complementary degenerative mutations. This makes it arguably the \"most likely\" mechanism for retention and divergence compared to neofunctionalization, which relies on rarer gain-of-function mutations.\n\n<<<D>>>"
