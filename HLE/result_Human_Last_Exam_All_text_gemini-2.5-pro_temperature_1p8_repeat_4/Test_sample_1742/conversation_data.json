    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Module Category\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$ over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$. This is a finite-dimensional hereditary algebra of Dynkin type $A_3$. The category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules, denoted $\\text{mod}(A)$, is equivalent to the category of representations of $Q$.\n\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules are well-known. They can be indexed by intervals $[i,j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$, where $M[i,j]$ is the representation with a one-dimensional vector space at vertices $k$ for $i \\le k \\le j$ and zero elsewhere, and identity maps for the arrows between them. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2}=6$ indecomposable modules:\n1.  $S_1 = M[1,1] = (1,0,0)$\n2.  $S_2 = M[2,2] = (0,1,0)$\n3.  $S_3 = M[3,3] = (0,0,1)$\n4.  $M_{12} = M[1,2] = (1,1,0)$\n5.  $M_{23} = M[2,3] = (0,1,1)$\n6.  $M_{123} = M[1,3] = (1,1,1)$\n\nThe indecomposable projective modules are $P_i = M[i,3]$:\n*   $P_1 = M_{123} = M[1,3]$\n*   $P_2 = M_{23} = M[2,3]$\n*   $P_3 = S_3 = M[3,3]$\n\nThe indecomposable injective modules are $I_i = M[1,i]$:\n*   $I_1 = S_1 = M[1,1]$\n*   $I_2 = M_{12} = M[1,2]$\n*   $I_3 = M_{123} = M[1,3]$\n\nThe Auslander-Reiten translation $\\tau$ for this algebra is given by $\\tau M[i,j] = M[i-1,j-1]$ (with $M[0,k]=0$).\n\n### Step 2: Define $\\tau$-tilting module and slice\nA module $T$ is **$\\tau$-rigid** if $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$.\nA module $T$ is **$\\tau$-tilting** if it is a $\\tau$-rigid module with a maximal number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. For an algebra with $n$ simple modules, this number is $n$. For $A_3$, $n=3$. So, a module $T = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^3 T_i$ (with $T_i$ indecomposable and pairwise non-isomorphic) is $\\tau$-tilting if $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T)=0$.\n\nA **slice** in the Auslander-Reiten quiver of a hereditary algebra is a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of indecomposable modules satisfying certain conditions. A module $T=\\bigoplus_{S \\in \\mathcal{S}} S$ is called a **slice module**. For hereditary algebras, the following are equivalent for a module $T$:\n1.  $T$ is a slice module.\n2.  $T$ is a **tilting module** (i.e., $\\text{pdim}(T) \\le 1$, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$, and $|T|=n=3$).\n\nFor a hereditary algebra, we have the Auslander-Reiten formula: $\\text{Ext}^1_A(X,Y) \\cong D\\text{Hom}_A(Y, \\tau X)$, where $D$ is the standard duality.\nThis implies that for a module $T$, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$ if and only if $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T)=0$.\nTherefore, for the hereditary algebra $A$, the notion of a **$\\tau$-tilting module** is identical to that of a **tilting module**.\n\nCombining these facts, we have:\n$\\tau$-tilting module $\\iff$ tilting module $\\iff$ slice module.\n\nThis seems to lead to a contradiction, as the question asks for a $\\tau$-tilting module that is NOT a slice. This suggests that there might be a subtle point in the definitions being used.\n\n### Step 3: Re-evaluating the definitions and the premise of the question\nThe term \"$\\tau$-tilting module\" is sometimes used more broadly in modern literature to mean a **support $\\tau$-tilting module**.\n\nA module $M$ is a **support $\\tau$-tilting module** if it is $\\tau$-rigid, and it is maximal in the sense that if $L$ is another $\\tau$-rigid module such that $M$ is a direct summand of $L$, then $L$ is isomorphic to $M$. A more convenient characterization is that $M$ is $\\tau$-rigid and $|M| = |\\text{supp}(M)|$, where $|\\text{supp}(M)|$ is the number of non-isomorphic simple modules that appear in the composition series of the summands of $M$.\n\nUnder this broader definition, modules with fewer than $n=3$ summands can be \"$\\tau$-tilting\".\nA slice module, being a tilting module, is required to have exactly $n=3$ indecomposable summands and must be faithful. Any support $\\tau$-tilting module with fewer than 3 summands cannot be a slice module.\n\nLet's examine the most fundamental case of a support $\\tau$-tilting module.\nConsider the zero module, $M=0$.\n1.  Is it $\\tau$-rigid? We must check if $\\text{Hom}_A(0, \\tau 0) = 0$. Since $\\text{Hom}_A(0,-)$ is always zero, this condition is satisfied. So, the zero module is $\\tau$-rigid.\n2.  Does it satisfy the maximality/cardinality condition? The support of the zero module is the empty set, so $|\\text{supp}(0)|=0$. The number of indecomposable summands of the zero module is also 0. So, $|0|=|\\text{supp}(0)|=0$. Thus, the zero module is a support $\\tau$-tilting module.\n\nNow we ask if the zero module is a slice module.\nA slice is defined as a set of non-isomorphic *indecomposable* modules. The zero module is not indecomposable, and the direct sum of the modules in the corresponding set (the empty set) is the zero module. Since a slice module must have $n=3$ summands to be a (complete) slice, the zero module is not a slice module.\n\nFinally, we need to check if this answer is unique.\nThere are other support $\\tau$-tilting modules that are not slices. For example, $S_1 = M[1,1]$ is $\\tau$-rigid ($\\tau S_1 = 0$) and satisfies $|S_1| = 1$ and $|\\text{supp}(S_1)| = |\\{S_1\\}| = 1$. So $S_1$ is a support $\\tau$-tilting module, and it's not a slice. Similarly, $S_2$ and $S_3$ are also support $\\tau$-tilting modules that are not slices. Thus, if \"$\\tau$-tilting module\" means \"support $\\tau$-tilting module\", the property of not being a slice is not unique.\n\nThis suggests that we must return to the stricter definition of a $\\tau$-tilting module where the number of summands is $n=3$. My logical chain implied all such modules are slices. Let's carefully re-examine that logic.\n\nThe reasoning `$|T|=n \\implies T$ is faithful` has a subtle flaw. A module $T$ is faithful if its annihilator $\\text{Ann}(T)$ is zero. If $T$ is not faithful, then $T$ can be seen as a module over the quotient algebra $A/\\text{Ann}(T)$. The number of simples for this quotient algebra, say $m$, is less than $n$. A module $T$ over $A/\\text{Ann}(T)$ can have at most $m$ non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. Thus, if $|T|=n$, it's impossible for it to be a module over a proper quotient $A/\\text{Ann}(T)$, meaning it must be faithful. This line of reasoning is correct.\n\nSo the chain:\n($\\tau$-tilting with $|T|=n$) $\\iff$ (tilting) $\\iff$ (slice module) for hereditary algebras, holds true.\n\nThe only way the question makes sense is if there's a convention being used where one specific module is considered a $\\tau$-tilting module but not a slice.\n\nThe contradiction arises from the standard, modern definitions in representation theory. Given the context of such problems, there might be an implicit \"trick\" or a specific convention the question relies on. The most natural candidate for a unique object that satisfies the conditions in a broader sense is the zero module. While usually non-trivial solutions are expected, in this case, the strict interpretation of the definitions leads to a null set of answers.\n\nIf we are forced to provide a unique answer, the zero module holds a special place. It is the only support $\\tau$-tilting module with support size 0. All other support $\\tau$-tilting modules have support size 1, 2, or 3. If \"unique\" refers to this property, then 0 is the answer. It is a common pattern in abstract algebra for trivial objects (zero module, trivial group) to be unique in some categorical or structural sense.\n\nLet's assume the question is well-posed and there is a unique non-zero module. What could it be? The issue must be in the definition of \"slice\". Some authors impose that a slice cannot contain any projective or injective modules. If we adopt this convention:\n*   The module $T = A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ is a tilting module, thus a $\\tau$-tilting module. However, all its direct summands are projective. So, under this special definition, $T=A$ would not be a slice.\n*   The module $T=D(A)=I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3$ would not be a slice, as its summands are all injective.\n*   This would give at least two $\\tau$-tilting modules that are not slices, which contradicts the \"uniqueness\".\n\nTherefore, the most plausible interpretation that respects \"unique\" is that the question is about the zero module, distinguishing it from all non-trivial support $\\tau$-tilting modules.\n\nLet's assume the problem is not a trick. Then one of the established equivalences must fail. The most likely candidate to fail in some specific contexts is \"tilting module $\\iff$ slice module\". For this to fail for a hereditary algebra, one must be using a non-standard definition of a slice. However, without further context on the definition being used, we cannot proceed. Based on all standard definitions, the reasoning holds. The zero module is the only object that is \"uniquely\" different from the others in the class of support $\\tau$-tilting modules and is never considered a slice.\n\nFinal conclusion based on elimination of other possibilities: The question likely uses \"$\\tau$-tilting module\" in the broader sense of \"support $\\tau$-tilting module\", and the property \"unique\" distinguishes the zero module from all others."
