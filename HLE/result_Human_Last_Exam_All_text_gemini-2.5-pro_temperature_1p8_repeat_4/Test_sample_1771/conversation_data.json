    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gyeti`.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂gyeti` (more accurately `*sh₂g-yé-ti`)\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-` meaning 'to track, seek out'. The cognates given, Hittite `sākizzi` ('he gives a sign') and Latin `sāgīre` ('to perceive keenly'), confirm this root.\n*   **Structure:** This is a present tense verb form.\n    *   `*sh₂g-`: The zero-grade of the root.\n    *   `*-yé-`: A thematic suffix used to form present tense verbs (a \"*ye/yo*-present\"). The accent falls on this suffix.\n    *   `*-ti`: The standard third-person singular active ending.\n*   **Phonology:** The key elements for its development into Germanic are the consonants `*s` and `*g`, and the laryngeal `*h₂`. In the full grade, this root would be `*seh₂g-`, which is easier to work with. The laryngeal `*h₂` has an \"a-coloring\" effect on an adjacent `*e` vowel.\n\n### **Step 2: Deriving the Proto-Germanic (PGmc) Form**\n\nWe apply the major sound laws that mark the transition from PIE to Proto-Germanic. The infinitive form, generally reconstructed as `*sōkjaną`, is the most useful common starting point for the daughter languages.\n\n1.  **Laryngeal Effect:** The PIE root `*seh₂g-` develops into `*sāg-`. The `*h₂` colors the vowel to `*a` and disappears, lengthening the vowel in its wake.\n2.  **Vowel Shift:** PIE `*ā` becomes PGmc `*ō`. Therefore, `*sāg-` becomes `*sōg-`.\n3.  **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Sound Shift):** This law affects consonants.\n    *   The PIE voiced stop `*g` shifts to a voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   Therefore, `*sōg-` becomes **`*sōk-`**.\n4.  **Verner's Law:** This law voices fricatives when the original PIE accent was not on the preceding syllable. Since Grimm's law turned `*g` into a stop (`*k`), not a fricative, Verner's law does not apply to this consonant.\n5.  **Verb Class:** The `*-ye/yo-` suffix in PIE becomes the suffix `*-ja-` in PGmc, which forms Class 1 weak verbs. The infinitive ending in PGmc is `*-aną`.\n6.  **Reconstructed PGmc Form:** Combining the root `*sōk-` with the suffix `*-ja-` and infinitive ending `*-aną` gives the infinitive **`*sōkjaną`**. The 3rd person singular would be `*sōkiþi`.\n\n### **Step 3: Deriving the Forms in the Daughter Languages from PGmc `*sōkjaną`**\n\n**A. Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*j` in the suffix `*-jan` causes the preceding back vowel `*ō` (/oː/) to be fronted. The fronted equivalent of `*ō` is `*œ` (/øː/), written as `œ` or `æ`. So, `*sōk-` becomes `sœk-`.\n2.  **Loss of Medial `*j`:** After causing i-umlaut, the `*j` is generally lost.\n3.  **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc ending `*-aną` becomes `-a` in Old Norse.\n4.  **Resulting Form:** `sœk-` + `-ja` -> `sœkja`. (The `j` is retained in writing after velars).\n*   **Old Norse:** **`sœkja`** (alternate spelling **`sækja`**) meaning 'to seek'.\n\n**B. Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** As in Old Norse, the `*j` causes the umlaut of the root vowel `*ō`. In Old English, the i-umlaut of `ō` is `ē`. So, `*sōk-` becomes `sēc-`.\n2.  **West Germanic Gemination:** This rule doubles consonants before a `*j`, but it typically applies only after short vowels. Since `*ō` is a long vowel, gemination of the `*k` does not occur.\n3.  **Loss of Medial `*j`:** The `*j` is lost after causing umlaut.\n4.  **Palatalization:** The velar consonant `k` (written `c`) is palatalized to `ċ` (the sound /tʃ/, as in 'church') when it comes before a front vowel like the newly formed `ē`.\n5.  **Infinitive Ending:** PGmc `*-aną` becomes `-an` in Old English.\n6.  **Resulting Form:** `sēc-` + `-an` -> `sēċan`.\n*   **Old English:** **`sēċan`** meaning 'to seek'.\n\n**C. Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **OHG Diphthongization:** PGmc long vowel `*ō` diphthongizes to `uo` in Old High German. So `*sōk-` becomes `suok-`.\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This is the defining feature of High German. The PGmc voiceless stop `*k` shifts to a voiceless fricative `hh` (pronounced /x/, like the 'ch' in Scottish 'loch') when it follows a vowel. Thus, `*suok-` becomes `suohh-`.\n3.  **I-Umlaut:** The suffix `*-jan` would normally cause i-umlaut (`uo` > `üe`). However, in this specific class of weak verbs in OHG, i-umlaut does *not* consistently appear in the infinitive form (a phenomenon known as *Rückumlaut* or umlaut-reversal is at play in the verb paradigm, but the infinitive remains un-umlauted).\n4.  **Infinitive Ending:** PGmc `*-aną` becomes `-an` or `-en`.\n5.  **Resulting Form:** `suohh-` + `-en` -> `suohhen`.\n*   **Old High German:** **`suohhen`** meaning 'to seek, to look for'.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkjaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkja` (or `sækja`)\n*   **Old English:** `sēċan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkjaną; Old Norse: sœkja (or sækja); Old English: sēċan; Old High German: suohhen.>>>"
