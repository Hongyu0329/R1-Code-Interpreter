No. Spontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that is forbidden in materials with inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophenes) are centrosymmetric. Therefore, their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero, and they would not be expected to exhibit this effect.
