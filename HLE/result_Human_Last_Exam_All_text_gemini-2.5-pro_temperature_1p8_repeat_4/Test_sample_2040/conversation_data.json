    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the core process:** The question asks about \"spontaneous parametric downconversion\" (SPDC). This is a specific nonlinear optical phenomenon.\n2.  **Identify the material:** The material is \"free-standing boron nanosheets\". This refers to two-dimensional (2D) sheets of boron atoms, also known as borophene, existing without a supporting substrate.\n3.  **Identify the condition:** The condition is \"when excited by incident light,\" which means a pump laser is illuminating the material.\n4.  **Connect the process and the material:** The central task is to determine if the physical properties of boron nanosheets allow for SPDC to occur.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Fundamental Requirement for SPDC:** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. Such processes are governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as χ⁽²⁾. A material can only exhibit SPDC if it has a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ value.\n2.  **Symmetry and χ⁽²⁾:** A fundamental principle of nonlinear optics is that the second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is strictly zero for any material possessing a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., any centrosymmetric material). Therefore, the key question is whether the crystal structure of boron nanosheets is centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.\n3.  **Structure of Boron Nanosheets:** Unlike graphene, which has a single, well-defined structure, boron nanosheets (borophenes) can exist in several different structural phases (polymorphs). The most commonly studied and synthesized phases are the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases.\n4.  **Symmetry of Borophene Phases:** We must examine the crystal symmetry of these common borophene phases.\n    *   The β₁₂-borophene phase has a space group of *P6/mmm*.\n    *   The χ₃-borophene phase has a space group of *Pmmn*.\n    Both of these space groups contain an inversion center. Therefore, these common, stable phases of free-standing borophene are **centrosymmetric**.\n5.  **Exclusions and Edge Cases:**\n    *   The question specifies \"free-standing\" nanosheets. This is important because a substrate can break the symmetry of the material system and induce a χ⁽²⁾ response. By specifying \"free-standing,\" this effect is excluded.\n    *   While the bulk of an ideal, perfect sheet is centrosymmetric, real-world factors like strain, wrinkles, defects, or the edges of the sheet can locally break the inversion symmetry. These could lead to a very weak, localized SPDC signal, but it would not be a characteristic property of the ideal material itself.\n    *   Centrosymmetric materials *do* possess a non-zero third-order susceptibility (χ⁽³⁾), allowing for processes like third-harmonic generation and four-wave mixing. However, the question specifically asks about SPDC, which is a χ⁽²⁾ process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Path to the Final Answer\n\n1.  Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the host material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  A material can only have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ if its crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry (i.e., it is non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  The subject of the question is free-standing boron nanosheets. We must analyze the crystal structure of its most stable allotropes.\n4.  The common, thermodynamically stable phases of borophene (such as β₁₂ and χ₃) are known to possess a center of inversion symmetry. They are centrosymmetric.\n5.  Because they are centrosymmetric, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets is zero by symmetry.\n6.  Since χ⁽²⁾ is zero, the dominant mechanism for spontaneous parametric downconversion is forbidden.\n7.  Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n<<<No. Spontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that is forbidden in materials with inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophenes) are centrosymmetric. Therefore, their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero, and they would not be expected to exhibit this effect.>>>"
