    "This problem asks for the number of distinct power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the group Q_128**\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$ ($n \\ge 3$) is given by the presentation:\n$Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, x^{2^{n-2}} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor size 128, we have $2^n = 128$, which implies $n=7$. So we are analyzing the group $G = Q_{128} = Q_{2^7}$. Its presentation is:\n$G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nThe elements of $G$ can be written in the form $x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$ or $yx^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. The other 64 elements are of the form $yx^i$.\n\n**2. Understand Power Subgroups**\nFor a group $G$ and an integer $k$, the $k$-th power subgroup, denoted $G^k$, is the subgroup generated by the set of all $k$-th powers of elements of $G$:\n$G^k = \\langle \\{ g^k \\mid g \\in G \\} \\rangle$.\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the k-th powers of elements in G**\nWe need to compute $g^k$ for the two types of elements in $G$:\n*   **Type 1: Elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n    For an element $g = x^i$, its $k$-th power is simply $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$.\n*   **Type 2: Elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n    For an element $g = yx^i$, let's first compute its square:\n    $(yx^i)^2 = (yx^i)(yx^i) = y(x^i y)x^i = y(y x^{-i})x^i = y^2 x^{-i} x^i = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    This is a key property: the square of any element outside of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $x^{32}$, which is the unique element of order 2 in $G$ and is the center $Z(G) = \\{1, x^{32}\\}$.\n    Now we can find the $k$-th power of $g = yx^i$:\n    *   If $k$ is even, let $k = 2m$.\n        $g^k = g^{2m} = (g^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\n    *   If $k$ is odd, let $k = 2m+1$.\n        $g^k = g^{2m+1} = g^{2m} g = (x^{32})^m yx^i = x^{32m} yx^i$.\n\n**4. Determine the structure of G^k**\nWe now determine the subgroup $G^k$ generated by these powers, based on the parity of $k$.\n\n*   **Case 1: k is odd**\n    Let $k=2m+1$. The generating set for $G^k$ is $\\{ x^{ik} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} \\cup \\{ x^{32m} yx^i \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n    1. The first part, $\\{x^{ik}\\}$, generates the subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\text{gcd}(k, 64) = 1$. Therefore, $\\langle x^k \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$.\n    2. The generating set for $G^k$ contains all of $\\langle x \\rangle$. It also contains elements like $x^{32m}y$ (by setting $i=0$).\n    3. So, $G^k$ is generated by $\\langle x \\rangle$ and $x^{32m}y$. That is, $G^k = \\langle x, x^{32m}y \\rangle$.\n    4. Since $x^{32m}$ is a power of $x$, it is already in $\\langle x \\rangle$. The group $\\langle x, x^{32m}y \\rangle$ contains both $x$ and $y$ (since $y = (x^{32m})^{-1}(x^{32m}y)$).\n    5. Therefore, this generating set generates the entire group $G$.\n    Conclusion: For any odd integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is the group $G=Q_{128}$ itself. This gives us **one** power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case 2: k is even**\n    Let $k=2m$. The generating set for $G^k$ is $\\{ x^{ik} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} \\cup \\{ x^{32m} \\mid \\text{any } i \\}$.\n    1. The first part, $\\{x^{ik}\\}$, generates the subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n    2. The second part consists of the single element $x^{32m}$. We can write $32m = 16 \\cdot (2m) = 16k$. So $x^{32m} = x^{16k} = (x^k)^{16}$.\n    3. The element $(x^k)^{16}$ is already in the subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n    4. Thus, the entire generating set generates just $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n    Conclusion: For any even integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n\n**5. Count the number of distinct subgroups**\nWe have two types of power subgroups: $Q_{128}$ (from odd $k$) and $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ (from even $k$).\n\n*   The subgroups of the form $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ are cyclic subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle \\cong C_{64}$. The distinct subgroups of $C_{64}$ are of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of 64.\n*   The divisors of $64 = 2^6$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n*   For a subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ to be a power subgroup, $k$ must be even. The subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ is identical to $\\langle x^{\\text{gcd}(k, 64)} \\rangle$. Let $d = \\text{gcd}(k, 64)$.\n*   If $k$ is even, then $2$ is a common divisor of $k$ and $64$. Thus, their greatest common divisor, $d$, must be a multiple of 2. So $d$ cannot be 1.\n*   The possible values for $d = \\text{gcd}(k, 64)$ where $k$ is even are therefore the divisors of 64 that are greater than 1: $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n*   For each of these 6 possible values of $d$, we can find an even integer $k$ (e.g., $k=d$) such that $\\text{gcd}(k, 64) = d$. So, all these subgroups are indeed power subgroups.\n*   These 6 divisors correspond to 6 distinct subgroups:\n    1.  $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n    2.  $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n    3.  $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n    4.  $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n    5.  $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2, the center $Z(G)$)\n    6.  $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (order 1, the trivial subgroup)\n    This gives us **six** power subgroups.\n\n**6. Final Count**\nThe set of all distinct power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ is:\n$\\{ Q_{128}, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\}$.\n\nThese subgroups are all distinct. $Q_{128}$ is non-abelian of order 128. The other six are cyclic and have orders 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, so they are distinct from $Q_{128}$ and from each other.\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is $1$ (from odd k) + $6$ (from even k) = 7."
