    "This question asks for the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a set $S \\subset [0, 1]$ that is a Sidon set.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A subset $S$ of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are distinct, except for trivial rearrangements. Formally, for any $a, b, c, d \\in S$, if $a+b = c+d$, then it must be that the unordered pair $\\{a, b\\}$ is the same as the unordered pair $\\{c, d\\}$. This means either ($a=c$ and $b=d$) or ($a=d$ and $b=c$). A key consequence is that if $a \\le b$ and $c \\le d$, then $a+b=c+d$ implies $a=c$ and $b=d$.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension ($\\dim_H$)**: This is a way to assign a dimension to any set in a metric space, which can be a non-integer. It quantifies the \"fractal\" nature or \"roughness\" of a set. For a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, its Hausdorff dimension is a value between 0 and 1. A finite set has dimension 0, while an interval has dimension 1. A countable set also has dimension 0. To achieve a non-zero dimension, a set must be uncountable.\n\nThe question is to find the value of $\\sup \\{ \\dim_H(S) \\mid S \\subseteq [0,1] \\text{ and } S \\text{ is a Sidon set} \\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the dimension\n\nThe strong arithmetic restriction of the Sidon property limits how \"dense\" such a set can be, which in turn limits its Hausdorff dimension. The proof of the upper bound is a classical result in harmonic analysis and is quite technical. Here is a summary of the reasoning:\n\n1.  A Sidon set $S \\subset [0,1]$ can be scaled and mapped into the circle group $\\mathbb{T} = \\mathbb{R}/(2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})$ without changing its Hausdorff dimension. If $S$ is contained in a small enough interval (e.g., $[0, 1/4]$), the Sidon property for sums in $\\mathbb{R}$ is equivalent to the Sidon property for sums in $\\mathbb{T}$.\n2.  In the context of the circle group $\\mathbb{T}$, Sidon sets are strongly related to \"sets of uniqueness\". A classical theorem by Salem and Zygmund states that Sidon sets are a specific type of set of uniqueness.\n3.  A key result in harmonic analysis, ultimately following from the work of Salem, is that any Sidon subset of the circle group $\\mathbb{T}$ must have a Hausdorff dimension of at most $1/2$.\n4.  This result for $\\mathbb{T}$ translates back to subsets of $[0,1]$, giving us the upper bound:\n    $\\dim_H(S) \\le 1/2$ for any Sidon set $S \\subset [0,1]$.\n\n**A point of clarification**: A simple construction might seem to contradict this. For example, the set $C_3 = \\{\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_k 3^{-k} \\mid c_k \\in \\{0,1\\}\\}$ has dimension $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.63 > 1/2$. However, as shown by careful analysis, this set is **not** a Sidon set. There exist distinct pairs of elements whose sums are equal. This illustrates that the Sidon condition is very restrictive.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a lower bound for the dimension\n\nTo find the maximum possible dimension, we need to show that sets with dimensions approaching this upper bound actually exist.\n\n1.  The existence of Sidon sets with a dimension arbitrarily close to $1/2$ was first proven by Jean-Pierre Kahane. Using a sophisticated probabilistic method (involving random Cantor sets), he showed that for any value $\\alpha < 1/2$, it is possible to construct a Sidon set $S \\subset [0,1]$ with $\\dim_H(S) = \\alpha$.\n2.  This result implies that the supremum of the Hausdorff dimensions of Sidon sets is at least $1/2$.\n3.  Later work, and more detailed analysis of such probabilistic constructions, confirmed that it is indeed possible to construct a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of exactly $1/2$. These constructions are typically randomized and show that \"almost all\" sets in a certain class are Sidon sets of dimension $1/2$.\n\n**A point of clarification**: A simple Cantor-like set such as $C_4 = \\{\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_k 4^{-k} \\mid c_k \\in \\{0,1\\}\\}$ has dimension $\\dim_H(C_4) = \\log(2)/\\log(4) = 1/2$. However, one can show this set is **not** a Sidon set. The construction of a Sidon set with dimension $1/2$ is significantly more involved.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n*   From Step 2, we know that the dimension of any Sidon set $S \\subset [0,1]$ must satisfy $\\dim_H(S) \\le 1/2$.\n*   From Step 3, we know that for any $\\alpha \\in [0, 1/2]$, there exists a Sidon set $S$ with $\\dim_H(S) = \\alpha$.\n\nCombining these two facts, the set of all possible Hausdorff dimensions for a Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is the interval $[0, 1/2]$. Therefore, the maximum possible value is $1/2$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1/2}$."
