    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific anatomical detail about the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*.\n*   **Subject:** *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid theropod dinosaur.\n*   **Anatomical Feature:** The \"lacrimal recess\".\n*   **Specific Inquiry:** The number of \"depressions\" that the lacrimal recess *contains*.\n\nThis is a highly technical question that requires consulting paleontological literature describing the skull of this specific dinosaur.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Key Anatomical Terms\n*   **Lacrimal:** A bone in the skull that is typically located between the nasal bone, the maxilla, the jugal, and the prefrontal bone. It forms the anterior (front) margin of the eye socket (orbit).\n*   **Recess:** A depression or cavity in a bone. The \"lacrimal recess\" is therefore a depression on the lacrimal bone.\n*   **Depressions contained within the recess:** The question implies we are not counting the lacrimal recess itself, but rather smaller pits, holes (foramina), or cavities located *inside* this main recess.\n\n### Step 3: Locate and Analyze the Relevant Scientific Source\nThe most comprehensive description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull (holotype SMNS 58022) is the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\". This is the primary source for the anatomical details in question.\n\n### Step 4: Extract Information from the Source\n1.  The paper by Sues et al. (2002) describes the lacrimal bone in detail.\n2.  It states that the lateral surface of the lacrimal bone is marked by a large, subtriangular depression, which is the lacrimal recess.\n3.  Crucially, the paper then describes the features located *within* this recess. On page 537, it states: \"Within the posterodorsal portion of this recess, there are **two small pneumatic foramina**...\"\n4.  A foramen (plural: foramina) is an opening or hole in a bone, which functions as a depression on the bone's surface. These foramina were pneumatic, meaning they were connected to the dinosaur's air-sac system.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize the Findings to Answer the Question\n*   The lacrimal recess is a single, large depression on the lacrimal bone of *Irritator challengeri*.\n*   The question asks what depressions this recess *contains*.\n*   According to the definitive scientific description, the lacrimal recess contains **two** small depressions, which are specifically identified as pneumatic foramina.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Distinguish the recess from its contents:** It is critical not to confuse the lacrimal recess itself (one feature) with the smaller features it contains. The question is specifically about the contents.\n*   **Interpret \"depression\" correctly:** In this anatomical context, a \"foramen\" (hole/pit) is a type of depression.\n*   **Rely on the primary source:** For such a specific anatomical question, relying on the peer-reviewed scientific description of the type specimen is essential to ensure accuracy.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains two smaller depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
