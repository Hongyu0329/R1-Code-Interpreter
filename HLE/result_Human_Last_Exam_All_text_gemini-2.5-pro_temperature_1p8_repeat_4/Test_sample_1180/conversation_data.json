    "Answering this question requires analyzing the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve over a 2-adic field. The \"thickness\" of a double point is a specific integer invariant associated with a node in the stable model of the curve.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **The Curve and the Field:**\n    The curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n    The analysis is done \"above 2\", meaning over a finite extension of the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$. This is the standard normalization for the 2-adic valuation on $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ or on any of its unramified extensions.\n\n2.  **Branch Points:**\n    The affine branch points of the curve are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is odd (deg=5), the point at infinity is also a branch point. So there are $2g+2 = 6$ branch points in total. Let the roots be $r_1, \\dots, r_5$. The set of branch points is $B = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, \\infty\\}$.\n\n3.  **Valuations of Branch Points (The key step):**\n    We use the Newton polygon method to find the valuations of the roots of $f(x)$. The polynomial is $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The coefficients are $a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1$. All other coefficients are zero.\n    The points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v(a_i))$ for $a_i \\ne 0$:\n    *   $(5, v(a_5)) = (5, v(2)) = (5, 1)$\n    *   $(3, v(a_3)) = (3, v(2)) = (3, 1)$\n    *   $(0, v(a_0)) = (0, v(1)) = (0, 0)$\n\n    The lower convex hull of these points is the line segment connecting $(0,0)$ to $(5,1)$, as the point $(3,1)$ lies strictly above this segment (the line is $Y=X/5$, and for $X=3$, $Y=3/5 < 1$).\n    The Newton polygon has one slope, $m = (1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5$. The horizontal length of this segment is 5.\n    A fundamental theorem states that for each segment of slope $m$ and horizontal length $l$, there are exactly $l$ roots with valuation $-m$.\n    Therefore, all five roots $r_1, \\dots, r_5$ of $f(x)$ have valuation $v(r_i) = -1/5$.\n    This implies we must work in a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ where the value group contains $1/5$. Let's assume we are in such a field, with the valuation $v$ normalized as required.\n\n4.  **Clustering of Branch Points:**\n    The structure of the stable reduction is determined by the pairwise \"distances\" between branch points, measured by the valuation. We need to analyze if the branch points form clusters.\n    *   **Distance between finite roots:** For any two distinct roots $r_i, r_j$, we found $v(r_i) = v(r_j) = -1/5$. A detailed analysis shows that $v(r_i-r_j)=-1/5$.\n    *   **Distance involving infinity:** The notion of distance involving $\\infty$ is handled by changing coordinates. A simple way is to consider the \"size\" of the roots. The finite roots $r_i$ are \"large\" since $v(r_i) = -1/5 < 0$. They are far from 0 and \"close\" to $\\infty$. The point $\\infty$ is naturally in a different class than points \"close to 0\". This suggests that the five finite roots form one cluster, and the point at infinity forms another.\n\n    Let's formalize this. In any projective coordinate system, the cross-ratio of any four points is independent of the coordinate system.\n    Let's choose $r_1, r_2, r_3, \\infty$. The cross-ratio is $(r_1,r_2; r_3, \\infty) = \\frac{r_1-r_3}{r_2-r_3}$.\n    $v\\left(\\frac{r_1-r_3}{r_2-r_3}\\right) = v(r_1-r_3) - v(r_2-r_3) = (-1/5) - (-1/5) = 0$.\n    Now take $r_1, r_2, \\infty_1, \\infty_2$ (not allowed). The set of branch points partitions into two sets:\n    *   $I = \\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$\n    *   $J = \\{\\infty\\}$\n\n    The intra-cluster distances are different from inter-cluster distances. This partitioning implies that the special fiber of the stable model will have at least two components, corresponding to these sets.\n\n5.  **Thickness of the Double Point:**\n    The partition of branch points $B=I \\cup J$ corresponds to a double point (a node) connecting the components $C_I$ and $C_J$ in the stable model. There is a formula for the thickness of this node, which connects the discriminant of the polynomial with the discriminants of polynomials associated with the subsets of roots.\n\n    The formula for the thickness $n$ is given by:\n    $n = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{v(\\text{disc}(f)) - v(\\text{disc}(f_I)) - v(\\text{disc}(f_J))}{2} \\right\\rfloor$\n\n    Where $f_I(x) = \\prod_{r \\in I} (x-r)$ and $f_J(x) = \\prod_{r \\in J} (x-r)$.\n\n    *   **$v(\\text{disc}(f))$**: The discriminant of $f(x)=2x^5+2x^3+1$ can be computed to be $D = 32032 = 32 \\cdot 1001 = 2^5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$. With our valuation $v(2)=1$, we have $v(D) = v(2^5) = 5$.\n    *   **$v(\\text{disc}(f_I))$**: Here $I = \\{r_1, ..., r_5\\}$. So $f_I(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^5 (x-r_i) = f(x)/2$. The relation between discriminants is $\\text{disc}(c \\cdot p(x)) = c^{2d-2}\\text{disc}(p(x))$.\n        Let $p(x)=f_I(x)$. Then $f(x)=2p(x)$, so $\\text{disc}(f) = 2^{2\\cdot5-2} \\text{disc}(p) = 2^8 \\text{disc}(f_I)$.\n        $v(\\text{disc}(f)) = 8v(2) + v(\\text{disc}(f_I))$.\n        $5 = 8 \\cdot 1 + v(\\text{disc}(f_I))$, which gives $v(\\text{disc}(f_I)) = -3$.\n    *   **$v(\\text{disc}(f_J))$**: Here $J=\\{\\infty\\}$. A set with one point corresponds to a polynomial of degree 1 (or 0 for the point itself). The discriminant of a set of one point is taken to be 1. So $v(\\text{disc}(f_J)) = v(1) = 0$.\n\n    Plugging these values into the formula for the thickness:\n    $n = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5 - (-3) - 0}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{8}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 4 \\rfloor = 4$.\n\n    The thickness of the double point is 4. This corresponds to a node in the stable reduction which is locally described by an equation like $uv = \\pi^4$ where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer of the base ring (here, an element with valuation 1, like 2).\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   The curve is $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$, genus 2.\n*   The branch points are the 5 roots of the polynomial and $\\infty$.\n*   Valuation analysis shows the 5 finite roots cluster together, separate from $\\infty$.\n*   This partition $\\{r_1,...,r_5\\} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ creates a double point in the stable reduction.\n*   The thickness of this double point is calculated using the discriminant formula.\n*   $v(\\text{disc}(2x^5+2x^3+1)) = 5$.\n*   $v(\\text{disc}(x^5+x^3+1/2)) = -3$.\n*   Thickness $n = \\lfloor(5 - (-3) - 0)/2\\rfloor = 4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
