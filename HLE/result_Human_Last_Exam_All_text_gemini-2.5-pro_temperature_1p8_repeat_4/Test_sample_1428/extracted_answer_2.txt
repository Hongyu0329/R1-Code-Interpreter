The one-step transformation is $p_j(t+1) = \frac{1}{2} p_{j-1}(t) + \frac{1}{2} p_{j+1}(t)$. The transition matrix is $\hat{A}$ with elements $A_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}(\delta_{i, j+1} + \delta_{i, j-1})$. Its eigenvectors are vectors $v_n$ with components $(v_n)_j = e^{ij(2\pi n/N)}$ and the corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = \cos(2\pi n/N)$ for $n=0, 1, \dots, N-1$. The largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_0=1$. The second-largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_1 = \cos(2\pi/N)$. The rate of relaxation $R$ associated with an eigenvalue $\lambda$ is given by $R = -\ln(\lambda)$. Therefore, the rate of relaxation determined by the second-largest eigenvalue is $-\ln(\cos(2\pi/N))$.
