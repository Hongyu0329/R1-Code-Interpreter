    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the kanji character 謄.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Character's Structure:**\n    The kanji 謄 is a \"keisei moji\" (形声文字), a phono-semantic compound character. This means it is composed of two parts: one that suggests the meaning (the radical) and one that suggests the sound (the phonetic component).\n    The character 謄 has a clear left-right structure (known as *hen-tsukuri* in Japanese).\n    *   The left-hand side is: 言\n    *   The right-hand side is: 朕 with a slight modification.\n\n2.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):**\n    For characters with this left-right structure, the radical is most often the component on the left, the *hen* (偏). In the character 謄, the left-side component is 言. The meaning of 言 is \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"to say,\" which is semantically related to the meaning of 謄, \"to copy\" or \"transcribe.\" The right side serves as the phonetic component. Therefore, 言 is the radical.\n\n3.  **Determine the Name of the Radical:**\n    Radicals are often named based on their meaning and position within a character.\n    *   The radical is the character 言.\n    *   The standard On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) for 言 is \"gon\" or \"gen\".\n    *   When a radical appears on the left side of a kanji, the suffix \"-hen\" or \"-ben\" (from 偏, meaning \"left side\") is attached to its name.\n    *   Thus, the name for the 言 radical when it is on the left is a combination of its reading and its position: \"Gonben\" (ごんべん).\n\n4.  **Transcribe the Name:**\n    The final step is to write the name \"Gonben\" using Hepburn transcription, which is the standard system for romanizing Japanese. The hiragana ごんべん is transcribed as \"Gonben\".\n\n5.  **Careful Points:**\n    *   **Do not confuse 謄 with similar characters:** A common point of confusion is the character 騰 (to rise, to gallop). While it shares the same phonetic component on the right, its radical is on the left: 馬 (umahen). The question is specifically about 謄.\n    *   **Use the positional name:** As indicated by the example \"Onnahen\" for 媛, the name for the radical should include its position (*hen* for the left side, *tsukuri* for the right, *kanmuri* for the top, etc.). Simply stating \"gon\" would be incomplete.\n    *   **Correctly identify the main radical:** While 謄 contains other elements like 月 (tsuki), these are part of the phonetic component on the right, not the primary radical used for dictionary classification. The established radical for 謄 is 言.\n\nFollowing these steps, we confidently conclude that the radical of 謄 is called \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
