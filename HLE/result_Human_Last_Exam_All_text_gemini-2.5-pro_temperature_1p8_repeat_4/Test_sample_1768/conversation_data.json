    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Problem**\nThe task is to analyze a given DNA sequence that comes from the *middle* of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). This is a critical piece of information. An ORF is a continuous sequence of codons that can be translated into a protein. Since this segment is from the middle, it should not contain any premature stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA). We need to find which of the three possible reading frames fits this description and then provide the translated protein sequence.\n\n### **Step 2: List the Three Possible Reading Frames**\nAny DNA sequence can be read in three different ways, depending on which nucleotide is chosen as the starting point for the first codon. These are the three forward reading frames.\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Reading starts from the 1st nucleotide. Codons are nucleotides (1,2,3), (4,5,6), etc.\n*   **Frame 2:** Reading starts from the 2nd nucleotide. The first nucleotide is skipped. Codons are (2,3,4), (5,6,7), etc.\n*   **Frame 3:** Reading starts from the 3rd nucleotide. The first two nucleotides are skipped. Codons are (3,4,5), (6,7,8), etc.\n\nThe given sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Frame for Stop Codons**\n\nWe will translate each frame and look for stop codons. If a frame contains a stop codon, it is incorrect because the sequence is from the middle of an ORF.\n\n#### **Analysis of Frame 3**\n*   **Grouping:** We start from the 3rd nucleotide (`a`). The first two (`gg`) are ignored.\n    `gg` **aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga** `atg gaa cgg tga ...`\n*   **Finding a Stop Codon:** The 8th codon in this frame is **tga**, which is a stop codon.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a stop codon means Frame 3 cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n#### **Analysis of Frame 2**\n*   **Grouping:** We start from the 2nd nucleotide (`g`). The first nucleotide (`g`) is ignored.\n    `g` **gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg** `c`\n*   **Checking for Stop Codons:** A thorough check of all the codons in this frame reveals no stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`).\n*   **Conclusion:** This frame is a possible candidate.\n\n#### **Analysis of Frame 1**\n*   **Grouping:** We start from the 1st nucleotide (`g`).\n    **gga cat tgt tgt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg** `c`\n*   **Checking for Stop Codons:** A thorough check of all the codons in this frame also reveals no stop codons.\n*   **Conclusion:** This frame is also a possible candidate.\n\n### **Step 4: Select the Correct Frame and Translate**\n*   We have eliminated Frame 3, but both Frame 1 and Frame 2 appear to be \"open\" (free of stop codons).\n*   The problem asks for \"*the* frame\", which implies a single correct solution.\n*   Without any other biological context, the standard convention is to assume that the sequence as given starts on a codon boundary, which corresponds to **Frame 1**. Unless there is clear evidence to reject Frame 1 (like a stop codon, which is absent), it is the most logical choice.\n*   Therefore, we select **Frame 1** as the correct reading frame.\n\n### **Step 5: Translate the Sequence in Frame 1**\nNow, we translate the codons from Frame 1 into their corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code.\n\n*   `gga` -> **G** (Glycine)\n*   `cat` -> **H** (Histidine)\n*   `tgt` -> **C** (Cysteine)\n*   `tgt` -> **C** (Cysteine)\n*   `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n*   `gaa` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n*   `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n*   `ttg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n*   `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n*   `gga` -> **G** (Glycine)\n*   `acg` -> **T** (Threonine)\n*   `gtg` -> **V** (Valine)\n*   `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n*   `ttt` -> **F** (Phenylalanine)\n*   `tca` -> **S** (Serine)\n*   `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n*   `tct` -> **S** (Serine)\n*   `tta` -> **L** (Leucine)\n*   `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n*   `tac` -> **Y** (Tyrosine)\n*   `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n*   `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n*   `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n*   `ctt` -> **L** (Leucine)\n*   `aac` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n*   `agt` -> **S** (Serine)\n*   `gtc` -> **V** (Valine)\n*   `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n*   `gct` -> **A** (Alanine)\n*   `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n*   `cga` -> **R** (Arginine)\n*   `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n*   `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n*   `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n*   `tgg` -> **W** (Tryptophan)\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Frame:** 1\n**Protein Sequence:** GHCCSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<Frame: 1, Protein Sequence: GHCCSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
