    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Topic:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Photoplethysmography (PPG), which captures \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **The Question:** HRV is calculated from a \"value between heartbeats\". What is the technical name for this value/interval?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Concepts:**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR):** This is the average number of heartbeats in a minute (BPM). It's a measure of frequency.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is not the heart rate itself, but the measure of the variation in time *between* successive heartbeats. High variability is generally a sign of a healthy, adaptable nervous system.\n    *   **Beat-to-Beat Interval:** This is the fundamental piece of data used to calculate both HR and HRV. It is the precise amount of time that passes from the peak of one heartbeat to the peak of the very next heartbeat. This time is usually measured in milliseconds (ms).\n\n3.  **Identify the Technical Term:**\n    *   The \"value between heartbeats\" is a time interval. This time interval has a specific technical name in physiology and cardiology.\n    *   The gold standard for measuring this interval is an electrocardiogram (ECG), which tracks the electrical activity of the heart. The most distinct point in an ECG waveform for a single heartbeat is called the \"R-peak\".\n    *   Therefore, the time elapsed from one R-peak to the next is called the **R-R Interval**.\n    *   Although the question states the measurement is done by PPG (which measures blood volume changes, not electrical R-peaks), the term **R-R Interval** has become the standard and most common term used in the field of HRV, regardless of whether the source is an ECG or a PPG sensor.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **ECG vs. PPG Terminology:** While \"R-R Interval\" technically originates from ECG measurements, it is now used almost universally as the term for the beat-to-beat interval in HRV analysis, even when the data comes from a PPG sensor on a smartwatch or fitness tracker. A more technically precise term for PPG data would be \"Peak-to-Peak (P-P) Interval\" or the more general \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\". However, **R-R Interval** is the most widely recognized and used term.\n\n2.  **Interval vs. Variability:** It's crucial to understand that the R-R Interval is the raw measurement of time between two beats. HRV is not one of these intervals but rather a statistical analysis (e.g., standard deviation, RMSSD) performed on a whole series of consecutive R-R intervals to quantify their variability.\n\n3.  **Units:** The R-R interval is a duration, so its unit is time, most commonly expressed in **milliseconds (ms)**.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the value between heartbeats from which HRV is computed is the time duration between those beats. The most common and standard technical name for this interval is the **R-R Interval**.\n\n<<<R-R Interval>>>"
