    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall structure and symmetry of the molecule.**\n    The molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n    *   **Central Core:** The core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring, which is substituted at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry perpendicular to the plane of the benzene ring.\n    *   **Symmetry Implication:** Due to this C3 symmetry, the three large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent. Similarly, the three methyl groups on the benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are chemically equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, to find the total number of unique proton signals, we only need to analyze one of the three identical \"arms\" attached to the central ring and the unique part of the core itself.\n\n2.  **Analyze the signals from the central core.**\n    *   **Methyl Groups on the Benzene Ring:** The three methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. The three protons within each methyl group are also equivalent due to free rotation. Thus, all nine protons of these three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n        *   Signals from core methyls = **1**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The benzene ring is fully substituted at all six positions (1,3,5 with the large groups and 2,4,6 with methyl groups). There are no aromatic protons.\n\n3.  **Analyze the signals from the linker.**\n    *   The molecule has three identical linker groups: -CH2-. These are the \"methyl\" part of the \"substituent-methyl\" name.\n    *   Due to the C3 symmetry, the three -CH2- groups are equivalent. However, we must consider the two protons *within* a single -CH2- group.\n    *   Each -CH2- group is attached to the achiral benzene ring on one side and a large chiral substituent on the other side. The presence of a chiral center in the substituent makes the two protons of the -CH2- group diastereotopic.\n    *   **Careful point:** Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. They will couple with each other, typically appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). This means they produce two distinct signals.\n        *   Signals from the linker protons = **2**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the signals from one substituent arm.**\n    The substituent is ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl). This is a rigid, chiral, tricyclic system derived from camphor (a common chiral starting material). The structure is often called camphopyrazole. Let's count the number of non-equivalent protons in this group. Since it's a rigid chiral molecule with no internal symmetry plane, we expect most protons to be chemically distinct.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:**\n        *   There is a `7-methyl` group. This is on a bridgehead carbon. It gives **1 signal**.\n        *   There is an `8,8-dimethyl` group. This is a gem-dimethyl group on the one-carbon bridge. In a chiral environment, these two methyl groups are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will give two separate signals. -> **2 signals**.\n    *   **Skeletal Protons (on the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane framework):**\n        *   There is a single proton on the other bridgehead carbon (C4). This is unique. -> **1 signal**.\n        *   There are two -CH2- groups in the two-carbon bridge (C5 and C6). In this rigid, asymmetric framework, the two protons on C5 (endo and exo) are diastereotopic, giving 2 signals. The two protons on C6 are also diastereotopic, giving another 2 signals. Furthermore, the C5 position is not equivalent to the C6 position. Therefore, all four protons on these two CH2 groups are chemically different. -> 2 + 2 = **4 signals**.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:**\n        *   The pyrazole ring has one C-H proton (at the C3 position). This proton is unique. -> **1 signal**.\n    *   **Total Signals from one Substituent:** 1 (Me) + 2 (gem-diMe) + 1 (bridgehead H) + 4 (CH2's) + 1 (pyrazole H) = **9 signals**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total number of expected peaks (signals).**\n    We sum the number of unique signals from each distinct part of the molecule's asymmetric unit.\n    *   From central core methyls: 1 signal\n    *   From the linker -CH2- protons: 2 signals\n    *   From one substituent group: 9 signals\n\n    Total signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = **12**.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n- C3 symmetry correctly applied.\n- Diastereotopicity of linker protons and gem-dimethyl groups correctly identified.\n- Asymmetry of the rigid camphor-derived scaffold leading to non-equivalence of all skeletal protons correctly analyzed.\n- The counting for each part is consistent. The total of 12 is robust based on chemical structure principles.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation: 1 (Ar-Me) + 2 (linker CH2) + 9 (substituent) = 12 signals."
