    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the key terms:**\n    *   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine provides complete protection to a fraction of the vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection at all to the rest. Let's denote the fraction of individuals who are successfully protected as `VE_S`. The remaining fraction, `1 - VE_S`, receives no benefit and remains as susceptible as an unvaccinated person.\n    *   **Per-exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_p):** This is the proportional reduction in the probability of infection per single exposure to an infectious source. It is defined as `VE_p = 1 - (p_v / p_u)`, where `p_v` is the probability of infection per exposure for a vaccinated person and `p_u` is the probability for an unvaccinated person.\n    *   **Incidence Rate (IR):** The rate at which new cases occur in a population over a given time (e.g., new cases per person-year). We have `IR_v` for the vaccinated group and `IR_u` for the unvaccinated group.\n    *   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rates in the two groups: `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`.\n    *   **Estimator for Vaccine Efficacy:** The question considers the quantity `1 - IRR` as the estimator for vaccine efficacy.\n\n2.  **Relate Per-exposure Efficacy (`VE_p`) to the All-or-Nothing model:**\n    *   For an unvaccinated person, the probability of infection per exposure is `p_u`.\n    *   For a vaccinated person, we must consider the average probability. A fraction `VE_S` are completely protected, so their probability of infection is 0. A fraction `1 - VE_S` are completely unprotected, so their probability of infection is `p_u`.\n    *   The average probability of infection per exposure for a randomly selected vaccinated person (`p_v`) is the weighted average:\n        `p_v = (VE_S * 0) + ((1 - VE_S) * p_u) = (1 - VE_S) * p_u`\n    *   Now, we can calculate the true per-exposure efficacy (`VE_p`):\n        `VE_p = 1 - (p_v / p_u) = 1 - ((1 - VE_S) * p_u) / p_u = 1 - (1 - VE_S) = VE_S`\n    *   This shows that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the per-exposure efficacy is exactly equal to the proportion of people who are successfully immunized.\n\n3.  **Relate the Estimator (`1 - IRR`) to the All-or-Nothing model:**\n    *   The incidence rate is driven by the force of infection (hazard rate, `λ`) acting on the susceptible portion of the population. Let's assume the exposure patterns are the same in both groups, so `λ` is the same for any susceptible individual, regardless of their group.\n    *   In the unvaccinated group, everyone is susceptible (at least at the start of follow-up). So, the incidence rate `IR_u` is proportional to `λ`: `IR_u = λ`.\n    *   In the vaccinated group, only the fraction `1 - VE_S` is susceptible. The fraction `VE_S` is completely immune and contributes 0 to the incidence. Therefore, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) is the rate among the susceptible fraction, scaled by the size of that fraction:\n        `IR_v = λ * (1 - VE_S)`\n    *   Now, we calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR`):\n        `IRR = IR_v / IR_u = (λ * (1 - VE_S)) / λ = 1 - VE_S`\n    *   Finally, we calculate the value of the estimator:\n        `Estimator = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - VE_S) = VE_S`\n\n4.  **Compare the Estimator to the True Value:**\n    *   From step 2, we found the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy is `VE_p = VE_S`.\n    *   From step 3, we found the value of the estimator `1 - IRR` is also `VE_S`.\n    *   Since `Estimator = True Value`, the estimator `1 - IRR` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Model Assumption:** This conclusion depends critically on the vaccine's mechanism of action being purely \"all-or-nothing\". If the vaccine were \"leaky\" (i.e., reduces susceptibility for all vaccinated individuals by some percentage), the same conclusion holds, but the reasoning is slightly different. The key is that `1-IRR` estimates vaccine efficacy against susceptibility (`VE_S`).\n*   **Constant Hazard Assumption:** The direct equality `IRR = Hazard Ratio` assumes that the hazard rates (`λ` and `(1-VE_S)λ`) are constant over time. This is a common assumption in many epidemiological models and is known as the proportional hazards assumption. Even if hazards change over time, as long as they change proportionally, the `1-IRR` (estimating `1-Hazard Ratio`) remains a consistent estimator for `VE_S`.\n*   **No Confounding:** The analysis assumes that the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are comparable in every way that could affect the risk of infection (e.g., age, behavior, exposure level). In a real-world study, this would require randomization or statistical adjustment. The question, however, is about the theoretical property of the estimator itself, absent such study design flaws.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the mathematical expression for the per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) and the expression for the estimator (`1 - IRR`) are identical. Therefore, the estimator does not systematically overestimate or underestimate the true value; it correctly estimates it.\n\n<<<C>>>"
