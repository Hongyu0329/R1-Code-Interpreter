The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:
$Z = \int \mathcal{D}[\bar{\psi}] \mathcal{D}[\psi] \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$
where the functional integral is taken over all Grassmann field configurations $\psi(\mathbf{x}, \tau)$ and $\bar{\psi}(\mathbf{x}, \tau)$ that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, $\psi(\mathbf{x}, \tau = \beta) = -\psi(\mathbf{x}, \tau = 0)$. The term $S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]$ is the Euclidean action of the system, given by $S_E = \int_0^{\beta} d\tau \int d^d x \, \mathcal{L}_E$, where $\mathcal{L}_E$ is the Euclidean Lagrangian density.
