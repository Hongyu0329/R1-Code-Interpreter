    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the derivation of the formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the mathematical formula for the partition function, denoted by $Z$, for a system of fermions. The formula should be expressed using the path integral formalism in the imaginary time representation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of the Partition Function:**\n    *   In quantum statistical mechanics, the partition function $Z$ for a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$ is given by the trace of the density matrix operator. In the grand canonical ensemble (which is most common for many-body systems), this is:\n        $Z = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right)$\n    *   Here, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant).\n    *   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n    *   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n    *   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n    *   $\\text{Tr}(\\cdot)$ denotes the trace, which means summing the diagonal matrix elements over a complete basis of states.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Imaginary Time Path Integral:**\n    *   Feynman's path integral formalism provides a way to calculate quantum mechanical amplitudes by summing over all possible \"histories\" or \"paths\".\n    *   The expression $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$ is mathematically analogous to the quantum time-evolution operator $e^{-i\\hat{H}t/\\hbar}$ if we perform a Wick rotation, replacing real time $t$ with imaginary time $\\tau = it/\\hbar$.\n    *   Setting $t = -i\\beta\\hbar$, the time-evolution operator becomes the statistical operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$. This means the evolution in imaginary time from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=\\beta\\hbar$ (or simply $\\tau=\\beta$ in units where $\\hbar=1$) corresponds to the thermal equilibrium state.\n    *   The trace operation, $\\text{Tr}(\\hat{O}) = \\sum_n \\langle n | \\hat{O} | n \\rangle$, means we sum over all paths that start and end in the same state. This imposes boundary conditions on the path integral over the imaginary time interval $[0, \\beta]$.\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Fermionic Nature (Crucial Point 1: Grassmann Numbers):**\n    *   Unlike bosonic fields which are described by ordinary numbers (c-numbers), fermionic fields must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This is encoded by requiring that the field operators anti-commute.\n    *   In the path integral formalism, this anti-commutation is represented by using **Grassmann numbers** instead of ordinary numbers. Let's denote a set of Grassmann numbers as $\\{\\psi_i\\}$. They have the defining property:\n        $\\psi_i \\psi_j + \\psi_j \\psi_i = 0$ for any $i,j$.\n    *   A direct consequence is that $\\psi_i^2 = 0$, which is the path integral's manifestation of the Pauli principle (two fermions cannot occupy the same state).\n    *   Therefore, the path integral for fermions is a functional integral over paths of Grassmann-valued fields, typically denoted $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ and its conjugate $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$. The integration measure is written as $\\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}] \\mathcal{D}[\\psi]$.\n\n5.  **Define the Action:**\n    *   The \"weight\" of each path in the integral is given by $e^{-S_E}$, where $S_E$ is the **Euclidean Action**. The Euclidean action is derived from the classical Lagrangian by the Wick rotation ($t \\to -i\\tau$).\n    *   The general form of the action is:\n        $S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi, \\partial_\\tau\\psi, \\nabla\\psi, \\ldots)$\n    *   Here, $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is the Euclidean Lagrangian density. For a standard system of non-interacting fermions with dispersion $\\epsilon_k$, its Lagrangian density in momentum space might look like $\\mathcal{L}_E = \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Boundary Conditions (Crucial Point 2: Anti-Periodicity):**\n    *   The trace operation imposes boundary conditions on the fields over the imaginary time interval $[0, \\beta]$.\n    *   For bosons, this leads to periodic boundary conditions: $\\phi(\\tau=0) = \\phi(\\tau=\\beta)$.\n    *   However, for fermions, the anti-commuting nature of the fields leads to a crucial sign change. The boundary conditions are **anti-periodic**:\n        $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=0) = -\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=\\beta)$\n        $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=0) = -\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=\\beta)$\n    *   This is a fundamental distinction from the bosonic case and is essential for correctly describing Fermi-Dirac statistics.\n\n7.  **Assemble the Final Formula:**\n    *   Combine all the elements: the integration over Grassmann fields, the weighting factor $e^{-S_E}$, and the anti-periodic boundary conditions.\n\n### Final Formula with Step-by-Step Analysis Summary\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function $Z$ in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:\n\n$Z = \\int_{\\text{A.P.B.C.}} \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}] \\mathcal{D}[\\psi] \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n\nwhere:\n\n*   **$\\int_{\\text{A.P.B.C.}}$**: This represents the functional integral over all possible field configurations. The subscript \"A.P.B.C.\" emphasizes that the integral is restricted to fields that obey **Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions** in the imaginary time direction:\n    $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau = \\beta) = -\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau = 0)$\n\n*   **$\\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}] \\mathcal{D}[\\psi]$**: This is the functional integration measure. It signifies an integration over all values of the independent **Grassmann fields** $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ and $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ at every point in spacetime.\n\n*   **$e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$**: This is the Boltzmann-like weighting factor for each path.\n\n*   **$S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$**: This is the **Euclidean action** of the fermionic system, defined as:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$\n    where $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is the Euclidean Lagrangian density (often including terms like $\\bar{\\psi}(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu + \\hat{T})\\psi$, with $\\hat{T}$ being the kinetic energy operator). The integration runs over imaginary time $\\tau$ from $0$ to $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$ and over all $d$ spatial dimensions.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}] \\mathcal{D}[\\psi] \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\nwhere the functional integral is taken over all Grassmann field configurations $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau = \\beta) = -\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau = 0)$. The term $S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ is the Euclidean action of the system, given by $S_E = \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$, where $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is the Euclidean Lagrangian density.>>>"
