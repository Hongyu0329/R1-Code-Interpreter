    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Problem Core:** The fundamental task is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings.\n2.  **Input:** Two strings are provided on two separate lines.\n3.  **Guarantees:** The strings are guaranteed to have the same length, which is between 1 and 100 characters. They only contain uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   \"0\" if they are lexicographically equal.\n5.  **Primary Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we must minimize the total memory allocated for variables.\n6.  **Task:** The final output should be a number `m`, which is the total memory in bytes used for the variables in this optimal program.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitivity:** The comparison `'a' == 'A'` should be true. The easiest way to handle this is to convert characters being compared to a common case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase) before comparing them. The C function `tolower()` from `<ctype.h>` is suitable for this.\n\n2.  **Lexicographical Comparison:** The comparison should proceed character by character from left to right. As soon as a pair of characters at the same position are different (after converting to a common case), the comparison result for the entire strings is determined. If the loop finishes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n\n3.  **Memory Efficiency:**\n    *   A standard, straightforward approach would be to declare two character arrays, each of size 101 (to accommodate a 100-character string plus the null terminator `\\0`), to store both input strings. This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes for the strings alone.\n    *   To be \"most memory-efficient,\" we should question if storing both strings is necessary.\n    *   Input in C is read sequentially from a stream. We cannot read the first character of string 1, then the first character of string 2, then the second of string 1, and so on. We must read all of string 1 before we can read string 2.\n    *   Therefore, we **must** store the first string in memory.\n    *   However, we can avoid storing the second string completely. We can read the second string one character at a time using `getchar()` and compare it on-the-fly with the corresponding character from the stored first string. This is the most memory-efficient valid strategy.\n\n4.  **Variable Sizing:** To minimize memory, we must choose the smallest possible C data type for each variable that can safely hold its required range of values.\n    *   The string buffer needs to hold up to 100 characters plus a null terminator, so `char s1[101]` is the minimum required size for it.\n    *   A loop index needs to count from 0 up to a maximum of 99. The `unsigned char` type, which can hold values from 0 to 255, is the smallest data type that suffices, using only 1 byte.\n    *   When reading the second string with `getchar()`, its return value must be stored in an `int`. This is a crucial detail because `getchar()` returns `EOF` (an integer constant, typically -1) on end-of-file, which cannot be distinguished from a valid character if the result is stored in a `char`.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nBased on the points above, the most memory-efficient C program will use the following variables:\n\n1.  **A buffer for the first string:** To store the first string of maximum length 100, plus the null terminator (`\\0`), a character array of size 101 is required.\n    *   Declaration: `char first_string[101];`\n    *   Memory Usage: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **A loop counter:** To iterate through the stored string. The length is at most 100, so the index will go from 0 to 99. An `unsigned char` is sufficient for this range.\n    *   Declaration: `unsigned char i;`\n    *   Memory Usage: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **A variable for characters of the second string:** To read characters one by one from the second string using `getchar()`, we need an `int` variable to correctly handle the `EOF` (End of File) value.\n    *   Declaration: `int second_char;`\n    *   Memory Usage: `sizeof(int)`. On virtually all modern systems used for competitive programming (32-bit and 64-bit), an `int` occupies **4 bytes**.\n\nThe program logic would not require any other variables. It can perform the comparison inside the loop and print the result directly before exiting.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (m):**\n\n`m = (memory for first string buffer) + (memory for loop counter) + (memory for second string character)`\n`m = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes`\n`m = 106`\n\nTherefore, the total memory used for variables in the most memory-efficient implementation is 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
