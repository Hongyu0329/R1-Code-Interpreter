    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of the definition of a group and the properties of sets of different sizes.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**\n    *   We are looking for the smallest number `n`. This number represents the number of elements in a set `G`. Since `n` is a count of elements, it must be a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   We need to consider a set `G` with `n` elements.\n    *   We also need a binary operation `·` defined on `G`. A binary operation on `G` is a rule that takes any two elements `a, b` from `G` and produces a result `a · b` which is also in `G`. This property is called **closure**.\n    *   The core of the question is that the resulting mathematical structure, `(G, ·)`, must **not** be a group.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of a Group**\n    A structure `(G, ·)` is a group if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n    1.  **Closure:** For any `a, b` in `G`, `a · b` is in `G`. (This is guaranteed by the definition of a binary operation on `G`).\n    2.  **Associativity:** For any `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for any `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n    4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `a⁻¹` in `G` such that `a · a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ · a = e`.\n\n    For `(G, ·)` to **not** be a group, it must fail to satisfy at least one of these axioms (specifically, associativity, identity, or inverse, since closure is given).\n\n3.  **The Ambiguity of the Empty Set (n=0)**\n    *   Let's consider the smallest possible non-negative integer, `n=0`.\n    *   If `n=0`, the set `G` is the empty set, `G = ∅`.\n    *   A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, `G × G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set (the empty function), so a binary operation exists.\n    *   Is `(∅, ·)` a group?\n        *   Closure: Holds.\n        *   Associativity: Holds \"vacuously\" because there are no elements to test.\n        *   Identity Element: This axiom requires the **existence** of an element `e` in `G`. Since `G` is empty, no such element exists. The axiom fails.\n    *   Therefore, the structure with `n=0` elements is not a group.\n\n    This means `n=0` is a possible answer. However, in many standard mathematical contexts and textbooks, a group is defined on a **non-empty** set. The existence of the identity element (`e`) implies the set cannot be empty. We will proceed assuming this standard convention, which means `n ≥ 1`.\n\n4.  **Case n=1**\n    *   Let `G` be a set with one element, for example, `G = {a}`.\n    *   Let's define a binary operation `·` on `G`. Since `a` is the only element, the operation is completely determined by the result of `a · a`. For the closure axiom to hold, the result must be in `G`, so we must have `a · a = a`. This is the only possible binary operation on a one-element set.\n    *   Now, let's check if `(G, ·)` is a group:\n        *   **Closure:** `a · a = a`, which is in `G`. It holds.\n        *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`. And `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. It holds.\n        *   **Identity Element:** We need an element `e` such that `e · a = a`. The only candidate is `e = a`. Since `a · a = a`, `a` is indeed the identity element. It holds.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** We need an inverse for each element. The only element is `a`. Its inverse `a⁻¹` must satisfy `a · a⁻¹ = e`. Here `e=a`. So we need `a · a⁻¹ = a`. The only choice for `a⁻¹` is `a` itself. `a · a = a`, so the inverse of `a` is `a`. It holds.\n    *   Since all axioms are satisfied, any set with one element under any possible binary operation is a group (the trivial group). We cannot construct a non-group for `n=1`.\n\n5.  **Case n=2**\n    *   Let `G` be a set with two elements, for example, `G = {e, x}`.\n    *   We need to see if we can define a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is **not** a group. We only need to find one such example.\n    *   Let's try to make a structure that fails the \"Inverse Element\" axiom. To do this, we should first satisfy the identity axiom. Let's designate `e` as the identity element.\n    *   This determines the first row and column of our operation table (Cayley table):\n        `e · e = e`\n        `e · x = x`\n        `x · e = x`\n    *   Now we only need to define `x · x`. For closure, `x · x` must be either `e` or `x`.\n        *   **Possibility A:** If we set `x · x = e`, the structure forms a group (isomorphic to `Z₂`). This is not what we want.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Let's set `x · x = x`.\n    *   Our complete operation table is:\n        ```\n        · | e   x\n        --|------\n        e | e   x\n        x | x   x\n        ```\n    *   Let's check if this structure is a group:\n        *   **Closure:** All results (`e`, `x`) are in `G`. It holds.\n        *   **Associativity:** It can be verified that `(a·b)·c = a·(b·c)` for all choices of `a, b, c`. The non-trivial case is `(x·x)·x = x·x = x` and `x·(x·x) = x·x = x`. It holds. (This structure is a monoid).\n        *   **Identity Element:** `e` acts as the identity element by our construction. It holds.\n        *   **Inverse Element:**\n            *   The inverse of `e` is `e` itself (`e · e = e`).\n            *   What is the inverse of `x`? We need an element `y` in `G` such that `x · y = e`.\n                *   `x · e = x` (not `e`)\n                *   `x · x = x` (not `e`)\n            *   There is no element `y` in `G` that is the inverse of `x`. The inverse axiom fails.\n    *   Since one of the axioms fails, this structure is not a group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   For `n=1`, any structure `(G, ·)` must be a group.\n*   For `n=2`, we were able to construct a structure `(G, ·)` that is not a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number `n` (assuming `n ≥ 1` as per standard convention) for which a set of `n` elements can have a binary operation that does not form a group is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
