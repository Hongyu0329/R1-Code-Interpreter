    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific painting by a specific artist from a specific year, with a specific historical context.\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo (the Nazi secret police).\n*   **Question:** What object does he hold in his hand, and what is its symbolic meaning as an act of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific painting.**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the famous work titled *Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblume* (Self-Portrait with Poppy Flower). This painting is confirmed to have been created in 1933 after Querner, a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), was arrested and held in a makeshift concentration camp by the Nazi SA in Dresden before managing to escape.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the object in his hand.**\nBy examining the painting, *Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblume*, we can clearly see that Curt Querner is holding a single red poppy flower in his left hand.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object in its historical context.**\nThis is the most critical step, as the meaning is deeply tied to the circumstances.\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Color.** The poppy is bright red. In the political context of 1933 Germany, the color red was inextricably linked with communism and the socialist workers' movement. The Nazi regime was violently suppressing these political groups.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Act of Defiance.** By holding a red flower prominently in his self-portrait, Querner was making a dangerous and defiant statement. In a time when displaying overt communist symbols would lead to re-arrest or death, using a flower was a coded but powerful way to signal his unbroken political allegiance.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Artist's Expression.** Querner's gaze in the portrait is stern, direct, and confrontational. This reinforces the interpretation of the painting not as a lament, but as an assertion of his identity and convictions in the face of persecution. The poppy is not just a flower; it is a symbol of his continued belief in the cause for which he had just been imprisoned.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer.**\nCombining the findings, Curt Querner holds a red poppy flower. This object serves as a symbol of resistance because its red color represents his forbidden communist beliefs, which he defiantly reasserts through this coded symbol after escaping from Nazi custody.\n\n<<<In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a red poppy flower (Mohnblume). In the political climate of the time, the color red was the symbol of the communist and socialist movements. By holding the red poppy after his escape, he was making a defiant, symbolic statement of his unbroken political convictions and his resistance to the new Nazi regime.>>>"
