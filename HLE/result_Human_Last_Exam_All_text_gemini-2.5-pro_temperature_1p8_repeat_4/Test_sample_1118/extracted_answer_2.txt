In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a red poppy flower (Mohnblume). In the political climate of the time, the color red was the symbol of the communist and socialist movements. By holding the red poppy after his escape, he was making a defiant, symbolic statement of his unbroken political convictions and his resistance to the new Nazi regime.
