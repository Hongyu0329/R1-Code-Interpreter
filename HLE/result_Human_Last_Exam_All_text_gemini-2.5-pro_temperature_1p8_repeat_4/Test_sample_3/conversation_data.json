    "Answering the question requires a systematic approach, starting from the properties of the number field and utilizing established theorems in the theory of elliptic curves.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Number Field:**\n    The number field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field.\n    A crucial property of this field is that it is also a cyclotomic field. Let $\\zeta_3 = e^{2\\pi i / 3} = \\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ be a primitive 3rd root of unity. Then $\\sqrt{-3} = 2\\zeta_3 + 1$, which implies $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$.\n    Furthermore, for the 6th root of unity $\\zeta_6 = e^{2\\pi i/6} = \\frac{1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we see that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6)$ is also the same field.\n    So, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6)$. This means $K$ contains the 3rd and 6th roots of unity.\n\n2.  **Understand the Torsion Subgroup Structure:**\n    Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $K$. The set of torsion points rational over $K$, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$, forms a finite abelian group. The structure of this group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for positive integers $m, n$ where $m$ divides $n$.\n    A torsion subgroup is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$.\n\n3.  **Condition for Non-Cyclic Torsion:**\n    If the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ is non-cyclic, it must be of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m > 1$ and $m|n$. This implies that it contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ (the $m$-torsion points, $E[m]$).\n    A fundamental result related to the Weil pairing states that if $E[m] \\subseteq E(K)$, then the group of $m$-th roots of unity, $\\mu_m$, must be contained in $K$. In other words, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m) \\subseteq K$.\n    For $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we know $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_m) \\subseteq K$ holds for $m=1, 2, 3, 6$. Since we are interested in non-cyclic groups ($m > 1$), this implies that $m$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\n4.  **Use the Classification of Torsion Subgroups:**\n    The possible torsion structures for elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified by the work of Kenku, Momose, and others, with a comprehensive list for specific quadratic fields compiled by Filip Najman. We can consult this established classification for the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n5.  **List Possible Non-Cyclic Torsion Groups and Their Orders for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:**\n    According to Najman's classification, the non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   Groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\}$. The orders are:\n        *   $N=1: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = 4$\n        *   $N=2: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}| = 8$\n        *   $N=3: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 12$\n        *   $N=4: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}| = 16$\n        *   $N=6: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}| = 24$\n    *   Groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The orders are:\n        *   $N=1: |\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}| = 9$\n        *   $N=2: |\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 18$\n        *   $N=3: |\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}| = 27$\n    *   The group $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is:\n        *   $|\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 36$\n    This classification is exhaustive, meaning no other non-cyclic torsion structures are possible for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n6.  **Find the Maximum Order:**\n    We now compare all the possible orders we have calculated for non-cyclic torsion subgroups: {4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 36}.\n    The largest value in this set is 36.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 36. This order is achieved by a torsion subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
