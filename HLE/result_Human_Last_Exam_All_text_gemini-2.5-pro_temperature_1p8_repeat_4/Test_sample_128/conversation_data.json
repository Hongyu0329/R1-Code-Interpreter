    "**Analysis Step-by-Step**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the listed transformations on a single qubit cannot be achieved by any unitary quantum gate.\n\n2.  **Define Unitary Transformation Properties:** A single-qubit quantum gate is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`.\n    *   **Unitarity:** A matrix `U` is unitary if `UU† = U†U = I`, where `U†` is the conjugate transpose of `U` and `I` is the identity matrix. This property ensures that the total probability is conserved and the evolution is reversible.\n    *   **Linearity:** As a matrix transformation, a quantum gate operation is linear. This means `U(α|ψ⟩ + β|φ⟩) = α U|ψ⟩ + β U|φ⟩` for any scalars `α, β` and states `|ψ⟩, |φ⟩`.\n    *   **Physical Equivalence (Global Phase):** Quantum states are equivalent up to a global phase factor. This means the state `|ψ⟩` is physically indistinguishable from `c|ψ⟩` where `c` is a complex number with magnitude `|c|=1`. Therefore, a transformation written as `|A⟩ -> |B⟩` implies that `U|A⟩ = c|B⟩` for some phase factor `c`. Our task is to check if a single matrix `U` can satisfy all transformations in a given set, each with its own potential phase factor.\n\n3.  **Represent the Basis States:** We need the vector representations of the six basis states in the computational basis {|0⟩, |1⟩}.\n    *   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`\n    *   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`\n    *   `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    *   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\n4.  **Strategy: Test for Consistency with Linearity:** We will check each answer choice. For a choice to be a possible transformation, there must exist a single unitary matrix `U` that satisfies all the given input-output pairs simultaneously. We can use the linearity property to check for contradictions.\n\n    *   First, we determine the general form of the matrix `U` from its action on the computational basis states, `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`. Let `U|0⟩ = c₀|ψ₀⟩` and `U|1⟩ = c₁|ψ₁⟩`. This defines the columns of the matrix `U`.\n    *   Then, we use linearity to predict the output for the other basis states. For example, `U|+⟩` must equal `(1/√2)(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`.\n    *   We then compare this predicted output with the given output for `|+⟩` in the answer choice. `U|+⟩` must be proportional to the given output state.\n    *   This comparison will yield a set of algebraic equations for the phase factors. We repeat this for all given transformations.\n    *   If the system of equations is consistent (has a valid solution for the phase factors), the transformation is possible. If it leads to a logical contradiction, the transformation is impossible.\n\n5.  **Applying the Strategy to Answer Choice A:**\n\n    The transformations are:\n    *   `|0⟩ -> |1⟩`\n    *   `|1⟩ -> |0⟩`\n    *   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n    *   `|-⟩ -> |+⟩`\n    *   `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`\n    *   `|-i⟩ -> |-i⟩`\n\n    **Step 5a: Determine the form of U.**\n    Let `U|0⟩ = c₀|1⟩` and `U|1⟩ = c₁|0⟩`, where `c₀` and `c₁` are phase factors (`|c₀|=|c₁|=1`).\n    The matrix `U` acting on the basis vectors is:\n    `U|0⟩ = U[1, 0]ᵀ = [0, c₀]ᵀ`\n    `U|1⟩ = U[0, 1]ᵀ = [c₁, 0]ᵀ`\n    So, `U = [[0, c₁], [c₀, 0]]`.\n    This form of `U` is unitary since `UU† = [[|c₁|², 0], [0, |c₀|²]] = I`.\n\n    **Step 5b: Check consistency for |+⟩.**\n    *   Predicted `U|+⟩`: `U(1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀|1⟩ + c₁|0⟩)`.\n    *   Given transformation: `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`. This means `U|+⟩` must be proportional to `|-⟩`. So, `U|+⟩ = c₊|-⟩ = c₊(1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`.\n    *   Equating the two expressions for `U|+⟩`: `(1/√2)(c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩) = c₊(1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩ = c₊|0⟩ - c₊|1⟩`.\n    *   By comparing the coefficients of the orthogonal basis vectors `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`, we get two equations:\n        1.  `c₁ = c₊`\n        2.  `c₀ = -c₊`\n    *   Combining these gives our first constraint: `c₀ = -c₁`.\n\n    **Step 5c: Check consistency for |-i⟩.** (We can check any of the remaining states, but this one will reveal the contradiction).\n    *   Predicted `U|-i⟩`: `U(1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ - iU|1⟩) = (1/√2)(c₀|1⟩ - i c₁|0⟩)`.\n    *   Given transformation: `|-i⟩ -> |-i⟩`. This means `U|-i⟩ = c₋ᵢ|-i⟩ = c₋ᵢ(1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`.\n    *   Equating the two expressions: `(1/√2)(-ic₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩) = c₋ᵢ(1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `-ic₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩ = c₋ᵢ|0⟩ - ic₋ᵢ|1⟩`.\n    *   Comparing coefficients:\n        1.  `-ic₁ = c₋ᵢ`\n        2.  `c₀ = -ic₋ᵢ`\n    *   Substitute the first equation into the second: `c₀ = -i(-ic₁) = -i²c₁ = -(-1)c₁ = c₁`.\n    *   This gives our second constraint: `c₀ = c₁`.\n\n    **Step 5d: Identify the Contradiction.**\n    From the analysis of `U|+⟩`, we derived the constraint `c₀ = -c₁`.\n    From the analysis of `U|-i⟩`, we derived the constraint `c₀ = c₁`.\n    For both constraints to be true simultaneously, we must have `c₁ = -c₁`, which implies `2c₁ = 0`, so `c₁ = 0`.\n    This contradicts the fact that `c₁` must be a phase factor with magnitude `|c₁|=1`.\n    Since we have reached a logical contradiction, it is impossible for a single linear (and unitary) operator `U` to satisfy all the transformations specified in option A.\n\n    **Conclusion:** The transformation in option A is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation. We don't need to check the other options, as the question implies there is only one correct answer.\n\n>>>A"
