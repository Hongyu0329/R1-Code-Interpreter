    "This problem asks for the common name of a specific mathematical object used in the field of nuclear reactor physics, particularly in the study of nuclear criticality and reactor noise. Let's break down the question to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the function\nThe question starts with the **\"generalized pair correlation function\"**. In the context of neutron populations in a nuclear reactor, this refers to the correlation between the number of neutrons at two different points in space-time. Let's denote the neutron density at position $\\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$ as $n(\\mathbf{r}, t)$. The correlation function measures the extent to which the fluctuations of the density at two space-time points $(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1)$ and $(\\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$ are related. It is mathematically defined as the covariance of the density field:\n$C(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) = \\langle \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1) \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) \\rangle$\nwhere $\\delta n = n - \\langle n \\rangle$ is the fluctuation around the mean density. This function is fundamental to all neutron noise analysis techniques, such as the Rossi-alpha and Feynman-alpha methods, which exploit these correlations to infer properties of the nuclear system (like its reactivity).\n\n### Step 2: Understand the transformation\nThe question asks for the **\"space-time, double Fourier transform\"** of this function. This means we need to perform a Fourier transform with respect to all spatial and temporal coordinates. The full transform would be:\n$\\tilde{C}(\\mathbf{k}_1, \\omega_1; \\mathbf{k}_2, \\omega_2) = \\iint d^4x_1 \\iint d^4x_2 \\, e^{-i(\\mathbf{k}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\omega_1 t_1)} e^{i(\\mathbf{k}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\omega_2 t_2)} C(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$\n(Note: Conventions for the signs in the exponent can vary, but the physical meaning of the result is the same).\n\n### Step 3: Apply physical assumptions\nIn many practical situations, the system is assumed to be in a steady state, meaning its statistical properties are stationary in time.\n*   **Time Stationarity:** Under this assumption, the correlation function only depends on the time difference, $\\tau = t_2 - t_1$. So, $C(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) = C(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\tau)$. Performing the Fourier transform over the time variables then leads to a factor of $2\\pi \\delta(\\omega_1 + \\omega_2)$, meaning the result is only non-zero when $\\omega_2 = -\\omega_1$. The transform thus becomes a function of a single frequency variable, $\\omega = \\omega_1$. This resulting quantity, the temporal Fourier transform of the correlation function, is generally known as the **Cross-Spectral Density**:\n    $C(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\, e^{-i\\omega\\tau} C(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\tau)$.\n    When this is evaluated for signals from two different detectors, it is called the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**. If it's for a single detector signal correlated with itself, it's the **Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD)**. These are extremely common terms in the nuclear community.\n\nThe question also implies a spatial transform. Let's now Fourier transform $C(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\omega)$ with respect to the spatial variables.\n$\\tilde{C}(\\mathbf{k}_1, \\mathbf{k}_2, \\omega) = \\int d^3r_1 \\int d^3r_2 \\, e^{-i\\mathbf{k}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_1} e^{i\\mathbf{k}_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_2} C(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\omega)$.\nThis is the most general form of the spectrum in Fourier space.\n\n*   **Spatial Homogeneity:** If we further assume the medium is infinite and homogeneous, the correlation depends only on the spatial separation vector, $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$. This introduces another delta function, $\\delta(\\mathbf{k}_1 + \\mathbf{k}_2)$, into the transform. The physically meaningful quantity is the coefficient of the delta function, which is now a function of a single wave vector $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{k}_1$ and frequency $\\omega$. This is the direct analogue of the dynamic structure factor, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, in condensed matter physics.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the common name\nWe are looking for the common name for this Fourier-transformed quantity in the nuclear criticality community.\n*   The general term for the frequency spectrum of any noise process is **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**. This is the root of the terminology.\n*   APSD and CPSD are the specific names when the quantity is derived from detector signals and is only a function of frequency $\\omega$.\n*   When the spatial dependence is retained via Fourier transformation (i.e., the dependence on the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$), the quantity is a generalization of the PSD.\n*   In the authoritative textbook on the subject, \"Neutron Fluctuations\" by Pázsit and Pál, the quantity $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ (the result for a homogeneous system) is explicitly named.\n\nBased on this and other key literature in the field of reactor noise analysis, the double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function, which yields a spectrum dependent on both frequency and spatial wave-number, is called the **Wave-number-dependent Power Spectral Density**. Other slightly varying but equivalent terms include k-dependent Power Spectral Density or Spatial Power Spectral Density. The most descriptive and well-established term is Wave-number-dependent Power Spectral Density. It is a specific form of the more general Power Spectral Density that fully accounts for the space-time correlations of the neutron field.\n\n<<<Wave-number-dependent Power Spectral Density>>>"
