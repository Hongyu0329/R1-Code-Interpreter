The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is different for the two reactions due to distinct catalytic mechanisms.

*   **For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, the ideal molar Ni/Ce ratio is typically in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**. This higher ratio maximizes the number of active Ni-Ceria interface sites while maintaining good Ni particle dispersion.
*   **For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS)**, the ideal molar Ni/Ce ratio is significantly lower, around **0.05**. This low level of Ni doping is optimal for enhancing the bulk redox properties of ceria without causing the formation of a separate, less effective NiO phase.
