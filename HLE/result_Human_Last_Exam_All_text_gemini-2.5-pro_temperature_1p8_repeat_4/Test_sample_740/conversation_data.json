    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and simplify the kernel of the integral equation.**\nThe given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy \\frac{xⁿ - yⁿ}{x - y} u(y)$\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{xⁿ - yⁿ}{x - y}$.\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, $a^n - b^n = (a-b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1})$, we can simplify the kernel:\n$K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{k} y^{n-1-k}$\nNote that the kernel is symmetric, i.e., $K(x, y) = K(y, x)$. This means the integral operator is self-adjoint.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the integral equation into a system of linear equations.**\nSubstitute the simplified kernel back into the equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{k} y^{n-1-k}) u(y)$\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{k} ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-k} u(y) dy$\n\nLet's define a set of constants $c_k$:\n$c_k = ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-k} u(y) dy$ for $k = 0, 1, ..., n-1$.\n\nWith these constants, the solution $u(x)$ must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^k$\n\nTo find the constants $c_k$, we substitute this form of $u(x)$ back into their definition:\n$c_i = ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-i} u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-i} (1 + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j y^j) dy$\n$c_i = ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-i} dy + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-i+j} dy$\n$c_i = \\left[ \\frac{y^{n-i}}{n-i} \\right]₀¹ + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j \\left[ \\frac{y^{n-i+j}}{n-i+j} \\right]₀¹$\n$c_i = \\frac{1}{n-i} + λ \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{n-i+j}$\n\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown coefficients $c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}$. We can write this system in matrix form:\n$\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b} + \\lambda A \\mathbf{c}$, or $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$\nwhere:\n*   $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}]^T$\n*   $\\mathbf{b}$ is a vector with elements $b_i = \\frac{1}{n-i}$. So $\\mathbf{b} = [\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n-1}, ..., 1]^T$.\n*   $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with elements $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n-i+j}$, where $i$ is the row index and $j$ is the column index ($i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1$).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fredholm Alternative.**\nThe linear system $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$ governs the existence and uniqueness of the solution.\n1.  If $\\det(I - \\lambda A) \\neq 0$, there is a unique solution for $\\mathbf{c}$, and thus a unique solution $u(x)$ for the integral equation. This is the case when $1/\\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n2.  If $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$, then $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$. In this case, either there is no solution or there are infinitely many solutions.\n    *   Since the kernel is symmetric, the integral operator is self-adjoint. The Fredholm alternative states that a solution exists if and only if the forcing term, $f(x)=1$, is orthogonal to the null space of the homogeneous adjoint operator.\n    *   Because the operator is self-adjoint, the condition is that $f(x)=1$ must be orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the homogeneous equation $u_h(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x,y) u_h(y) dy$.\n    *   The orthogonality condition is $\\langle f, u_h \\rangle = ∫₀¹ f(x)u_h(x)dx = ∫₀¹ u_h(x)dx = 0$.\n    *   If $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value (i.e., $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of A) and the corresponding eigenfunction $u_h(x)$ satisfies $∫₀¹ u_h(x)dx \\neq 0$, then the equation has **no solution**.\n    *   If $∫₀¹ u_h(x)dx = 0$, there are infinitely many solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the condition for no solution.**\nAn eigenfunction $u_h(x)$ corresponds to a non-trivial solution to the homogeneous system $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = 0$. The coefficients $c_k$ of the polynomial form of $u_h$ form the eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $1/\\lambda$ of A.\nLet's check the condition $∫₀¹ u_h(x)dx \\neq 0$.\n$u_h(x) = \\lambda \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j x^j$.\n$∫₀¹ u_h(x)dx = ∫₀¹ \\lambda \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j x^j dx = \\lambda \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j \\frac{1}{j+1}$.\nFrom the eigenvector equation $A\\mathbf{c} = (1/\\lambda)\\mathbf{c}$, we have $\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} A_{ij} c_j = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} c_i$.\nFor the last row ($i=n-1$):\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} A_{n-1,j} c_j = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{n-(n-1)+j} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_j}{j+1}$.\nFrom the eigenvector equation, this sum is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\lambda} c_{n-1}$.\nSo, $∫₀¹ u_h(x)dx = \\lambda (\\frac{1}{\\lambda} c_{n-1}) = c_{n-1}$.\nThe condition for no solution becomes $c_{n-1} \\neq 0$.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solution if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value and the last component, $c_{n-1}$, of the corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}$ of the matrix A is non-zero. It can be shown that for the specific matrix A in this problem, any eigenvector will have $c_{n-1} \\neq 0$.\n\nThus, the values of λ for which there is no solution are precisely the characteristic values, which are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the values for specific n.**\n\n*   **Case n=1:**\n    $A$ is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix. $A_{00} = \\frac{1}{1-0+0} = 1$. The only eigenvalue is $\\mu=1$.\n    The characteristic value is $\\lambda = 1/\\mu = 1$.\n    So, for $n=1$, the equation has no solution if $\\lambda = 1$.\n\n*   **Case n=2:**\n    The matrix $A$ is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{00} & A_{01} \\\\ A_{10} & A_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1/3 \\\\ 1 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues $\\mu$ are found from $\\det(A - \\mu I) = 0$.\n    $(1/2-\\mu)^2 - 1/3 = 0 \\implies \\mu - 1/2 = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$. This is wrong.\n    $\\det(A - \\mu I) = (1/2-\\mu)(1/2-\\mu) - (1/3)(1) = \\mu^2 - \\mu + 1/4 - 1/3 = \\mu^2 - \\mu - 1/12 = 0$.\n    $12\\mu^2 - 12\\mu - 1 = 0$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\mu = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 4(12)(-1)}}{24} = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{192}}{24} = \\frac{12 \\pm 8\\sqrt{3}}{24} = \\frac{3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\n    The characteristic values $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$ are:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{6}{3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6(3 \\mp 2\\sqrt{3})}{9-12} = \\frac{6(3 \\mp 2\\sqrt{3})}{-3} = -2(3 \\mp 2\\sqrt{3}) = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n    So, for $n=2$, the equation has no solution if $\\lambda = -6 - 4\\sqrt{3}$ or $\\lambda = -6 + 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe question asks for the values of $\\lambda$. For a general integer $n$, these values are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ with entries $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n-i+j}$. A closed-form expression for these eigenvalues for general $n$ is not simple. However, the step-by-step derivation shows how they are characterized. Since the problem asks for \"the values\" without specifying $n$, it's likely expecting the answer for a general $n$. The characterization is the most direct answer.\n\nThe values of λ for which there are no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A defined by $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n-i+j}$ for $i,j=0, \\dots, n-1$.\n\n<<<The values of λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A whose elements are given by $A_{ij} = \\frac{1}{n-i+j}$ for $i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1$.>>>"
