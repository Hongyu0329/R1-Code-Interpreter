    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system.\n\n**1. Identify the System of Equations**\nThe system is given by:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (5u^2(t) - 3u(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$$\n$$u'(t) = u^2(t)(u(t) - 1)$$\nWe denote the right-hand sides as $f(d, u)$ and $g(d, u)$ respectively. We are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFirst, solve $u'(t) = 0$:\n$u^2(u - 1) = 0 \\implies u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\nNow, substitute these values of $u$ into the equation $d'(t) = 0$.\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $2d^2 + (5(0)^2 - 3(0))d - 0^3(1 - 0) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point $P_1 = (0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1 - 1) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This gives $d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points $P_2 = (0, 1)$ and $P_3 = (-1, 1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the half-plane $u \\geq 0$ are $P_1(0, 0)$, $P_2(0, 1)$, and $P_3(-1, 1)$.\n\n**3. Linearize and Classify the Equilibrium Points**\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n$$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d + 5u^2 - 3u & (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At P1 = (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are both 0. This is a non-hyperbolic point, and linearization does not determine its stability.\n\n*   **At P2 = (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & (10(1) - 3)(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, $P_2$ is an **unstable node** (a source).\n\n*   **At P3 = (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) & (10(1) - 3)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since they are real and have opposite signs, $P_3$ is a **saddle point**.\n\n**4. Identify the Separatrices**\nSeparatrices are curves in the phase plane that divide it into regions of qualitatively different behavior. They are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. Here, we have a saddle point at $P_3(-1, 1)$.\n\n*   **Stable Manifold of P3:**\n    From $u'(t) = u^2(u-1)$, we see that if $u(0) = 1$, then $u'(t) = 0$ for all $t$. Thus, the line $u=1$ is an invariant line. The dynamics on this line are governed by $d'(t) = 2d^2+2d = 2d(d+1)$. On this line, the fixed points are $d=0$ (P2) and $d=-1$ (P3).\n    - If $d \\in (-1, 0)$, $d'<0$, so trajectories move from P2 towards P3.\n    - If $d < -1$, $d'>0$, so trajectories move towards P3.\n    - If $d > 0$, $d'>0$, so trajectories move away from P2.\n    Trajectories on the line $u=1$ (except at point P2) approach P3. Therefore, the line $u=1$ (excluding the point (0,1)) is the stable manifold of the saddle point P3. This line is one separatrix.\n\n*   **Unstable Manifold of P3:**\n    The unstable manifold consists of trajectories that leave the saddle point P3. These curves are often difficult to find by direct integration. A common method is to look for a simple algebraic relationship between $d$ and $u$ that is an invariant curve (i.e., a trajectory).\n    Let's hypothesize a solution of the form $d = au^2 + bu + c$.\n    Since the separatrix must originate from a fixed point, it is likely to pass through other fixed points. Let's assume it connects the saddle $P_3(-1, 1)$ to the non-hyperbolic point $P_1(0, 0)$.\n    - The curve passes through $P_1(0, 0) \\implies c = 0$.\n    - The curve passes through $P_3(-1, 1) \\implies -1 = a(1)^2 + b(1) \\implies b = -1 - a$.\n    So the candidate curve is $d = au^2 + (-1-a)u$.\n\n    We substitute this into the system's differential equations. Differentiating our candidate curve with respect to $t$ gives $d'(t) = (2au - (a+1)) u'(t) = (2au - a - 1)u^2(u-1)$.\n    The original equation for $d'(t)$ becomes:\n    $d'(t) = 2(au^2 - (a+1)u)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(au^2 - (a+1)u) - u^3(1-u)$.\n    Equating the two expressions for $d'(t)$, dividing by $u^2(u-1)$ (for $u \\neq 0, 1$), and comparing coefficients of the powers of $u$ in the resulting polynomial equation yields a unique consistent solution: $a=-1$.\n    With $a=-1$, we have $b=-1-(-1)=0$.\n    So the equation of the invariant curve is $d = -u^2$.\n\n    We can verify this.\n    If $d=-u^2$, then $d' = -2uu'$.\n    Substituting $d=-u^2$ into the first ODE:\n    RHS = $2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1 - u)$\n        $= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n    LHS = $-2uu' = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^3(u-1) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n    Since LHS = RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed a trajectory of the system.\n    This curve passes through $P_1(0,0)$ and $P_3(-1,1)$. A trajectory that connects two fixed points is called a heteroclinic orbit. As it contains the saddle point P3, it must lie on its stable or unstable manifold. The eigenvector for the unstable direction ($\\lambda_2=1$) at $P_3$ is $v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The tangent to the curve $d=-u^2$ at $(-1,1)$ has slope $dd/du = -2u = -2$, which corresponds to the direction vector $(1, -2)$ in the $(u, d)$ plane or $(-2, 1)$ in the $(d,u)$ plane. This matches the unstable eigenvector.\n    Thus, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point P3. This is the other separatrix.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe system has two separatrices in the domain $u \\geq 0$:\n1.  The line $u=1$ (the stable manifold of the saddle).\n2.  The parabola $d=-u^2$ (the unstable manifold of the saddle).\n\nThe curve $d=-u^2$ is particularly important as it forms the boundary of the basin of attraction for the equilibrium point $P_1(0,0)$. Any trajectory starting in the region $d<-u^2$ and $0<u<1$ will converge to the origin. The question asks for \"the separatrix\", which commonly refers to the most significant or non-trivial separatrix curve.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
