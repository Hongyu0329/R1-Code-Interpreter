    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer gain matrix L.\n\n**1. System and Observer Formulation**\nThe given discrete-time system is:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nThe observer is given by:\nx_hat(k+1) = A*x_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))\nx_hat(k+1) = (A - LC)x_hat(k) + Bu(k) + Ly(k)\n\nThe observation error e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k) dynamics are:\ne(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\n**2. Deadbeat Observer Requirement**\nA deadbeat observer requires the error e(k) to converge to zero in the shortest possible finite time for any initial error e(0). This means that for some minimum integer q, (A - LC)^q = 0. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error matrix (A - LC) at the origin (z=0).\n\n**3. Pole Placement using Duality**\nThe eigenvalues of (A - LC) are the same as the eigenvalues of its transpose, (A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T*L^T.\nThis transforms the observer pole placement problem into an equivalent controller pole placement problem for a \"dual\" system.\nLet the dual system be defined by state matrix A_d = A^T and input matrix B_d = C^T. The feedback gain for this dual system is K_d = L^T.\nThe problem is now to find a gain matrix K_d = L^T such that the closed-loop matrix A_d_cl = A_d - B_d*K_d has all its eigenvalues at zero.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]\nC = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]\n\nSo, the dual system matrices are:\nA_d = A^T = [[-1, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]]\nB_d = C^T = [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n**4. Simplification for Multi-Output Systems**\nThe dual system is a multi-input system since B_d has two columns. Let B_d = [b_d1, b_d2], where b_d1 is the first column (transpose of the first row of C) and b_d2 is the second column (transpose of the second row of C).\nb_d1 = [1, 0, 0, 0]^T\nb_d2 = [1, 0, 0, 1]^T\n\nIf the pair (A_d, b_d1) is controllable, we can place the poles using only the \"first input\" of the dual system. This is equivalent to using only the first output y1 of the original system. This simplifies the design by letting us find an L matrix where the second column is all zeros.\n\n**5. Controllability Check for the Dual System**\nLet's check the controllability of the pair (A_d, b_d1). The controllability matrix is Wc = [b_d1, A_d*b_d1, A_d^2*b_d1, A_d^3*b_d1].\nA_d*b_d1 = [-1, 0, 0, 1]^T\nA_d^2*b_d1 = [0, 0, 1, -2]^T\nA_d^3*b_d1 = [2, 1, -2, 1]^T\nWc = [[1, -1, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, -2], [0, 1, -2, 1]]\nThe determinant of Wc is det(Wc) = -1, which is non-zero. So the pair (A_d, b_d1) is controllable.\n\n**6. Pole Placement by Coefficient Matching**\nSince the system is controllable, we can place the eigenvalues. We set L^T = K_d = [k_d1^T; 0], which means we need to find the vector k_d1 that places the poles of the SISO system A_d - b_d1*k_d1^T at the origin.\nThe desired characteristic polynomial is P(z) = z^4 = 0.\nLet k_d1^T = [k1, k2, k3, k4]. The closed-loop matrix is:\nA_d_cl = A_d - b_d1*k_d1^T = [[-1-k1, 1-k2, -k3, -1-k4], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial det(zI - A_d_cl) can be computed as:\ndet(zI - A_d_cl) = z^4 + (1+k1)z^3 + (k1+k4+2)z^2 + (k1+k3)z + (k2-1)\n\nTo make this equal to z^4, we set the coefficients of z^3, z^2, z^1, and z^0 to zero:\n1.  z^3 coeff: 1 + k1 = 0  =>  k1 = -1\n2.  z^0 coeff: k2 - 1 = 0  =>  k2 = 1\n3.  z^1 coeff: k1 + k3 = 0  => -1 + k3 = 0 => k3 = 1\n4.  z^2 coeff: k1 + k4 + 2 = 0 => -1 + k4 + 2 = 0 => k4 = -1\n\nSo, the required gain vector for the dual system is k_d1^T = [-1, 1, 1, -1].\n\n**7. Determine the Observer Gain Matrix L**\nWe set K_d = L^T with the second row as zero:\nL^T = [k_d1^T; 0] = [[-1, 1, 1, -1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nThe observer gain matrix L is the transpose of L^T:\nL = [[-1, 0],\n     [1, 0],\n     [1, 0],\n     [-1, 0]]\n\nThis matrix L will place all the poles of the observer at the origin, making the observation error zero in at most n=4 steps. The shortest possible time is given by the observability index of the system, which is 3. An observer with all poles at zero will satisfy the condition.\n\n<<<[[-1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]>>>"
