    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, a list of careful points, and the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Definition of the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe Green's function describes the propagation of a particle (or hole) in a many-body system. The *bare* or *non-interacting* Green's function, $G_0$, describes this propagation in a system without particle-particle interactions. For a fermionic system in the imaginary-time ($\\tau$) formalism, it is defined as the time-ordered expectation value of field operators in the non-interacting ground state:\n$G_0(x, \\tau; x', \\tau') = - \\langle T_\\tau [ \\psi(x, \\tau) \\psi^\\dagger(x', \\tau') ] \\rangle_0$\nHere, the subscript '0' indicates that the expectation value is taken with respect to the non-interacting Hamiltonian, $H_0 = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k c_k^\\dagger c_k$, where $\\epsilon_k$ are the single-particle energy eigenvalues for a state with quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum).\n\n**2. Expression in the Feynman Path Integral Formalism**\n\nIn the path integral formalism, the Green's function is expressed as a functional integral over anticommuting (Grassmann) fields $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau)$:\n$G_0(x, \\tau; x', \\tau') = - \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\ \\psi(x, \\tau) \\bar{\\psi}(x', \\tau') e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\nThe key ingredient is the non-interacting action, $S_0$.\n\n**3. The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe action for a system of free fermions is given by:\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\ \\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + H_0 - \\mu) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The operator $H_0$ in a basis of its eigenstates (the states labeled by $k$) gives the eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n**4. Evaluation via Fourier Transform**\n\nTo evaluate the path integral, it is convenient to transform to momentum-frequency space. We expand the fields in a Fourier series:\n$\\psi(x, \\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V\\beta}} \\sum_{k, n} e^{i(k \\cdot x - \\omega_n \\tau)} \\psi_{k, n}$\nwhere $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$ are the fermionic Matsubara frequencies. In this basis, the differential operator in the action becomes an algebraic expression. The term $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes $-i\\omega_n$, and $H_0$ becomes $\\epsilon_k$.\nThe action diagonalizes:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k, n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k, n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_{k, n}$\nThe action is now a sum of simple quadratic forms.\n\n**5. Deriving the Green's Function**\n\nThe expression for $G_0$ in the Fourier basis becomes:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\langle \\psi_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} \\rangle_0$\nThe path integral for each mode $(k,n)$ is a standard Gaussian integral for Grassmann variables. The result is the inverse of the coefficient of the quadratic term $\\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} \\psi_{k,n}$ in the action.\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = [-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu]^{-1}$\nIt is conventional to write this as:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n**6. Analyzing the Functional Dependence**\n\nFrom the final expression, we can directly identify the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\nFor any given frequency $i\\omega_n$ and momentum $k$, the quantity $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$ is a function of $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically:\n$G_0 \\propto (\\text{const} - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$\nThis means that $G_0$ has an **inverse linear dependence** on $\\epsilon_k$. Another way to state this is that the *inverse* of the bare Green's function, $G_0^{-1}$, depends linearly on $\\epsilon_k$:\n$G_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n) = i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k + \\mu$\nThis expression shows a direct linear relationship between $G_0^{-1}$ and $\\epsilon_k$ with a coefficient of -1. Physically, the poles of the Green's function correspond to the excitation energies of the system. For the bare Green's function, the pole in the complex frequency plane is located at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$, directly revealing the single-particle energy spectrum.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Bare vs. Full Green's Function**: This analysis is strictly for the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$). The full (interacting) Green's function, $G$, is related to $G_0$ by the Dyson equation, $G^{-1} = G_0^{-1} - \\Sigma$, where $\\Sigma$ is the self-energy. The self-energy accounts for interactions and its dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is generally highly complex and non-local, meaning $\\Sigma(k)$ can depend on all other $\\epsilon_{k'}$.\n*   **Formalism**: The result is obtained here using the imaginary-time (Matsubara) formalism. The result in the real-time (Keldysh) formalism is analogous. For example, the retarded Green's function is found by analytic continuation $i\\omega_n \\rightarrow \\omega + i\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$): $G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$. The fundamental inverse linear dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ remains.\n*   **Bosons vs. Fermions**: The derivation was shown for fermions. For non-relativistic bosons, the result is identical. For relativistic bosons (like photons or phonons), the action is second-order in time derivatives, leading to a different structure: $D_0(k, i\\omega_n) \\propto \\frac{1}{-(i\\omega_n)^2 + \\omega_k^2}$, where $\\omega_k$ is the particle's dispersion relation (energy). Even here, the inverse propagator $D_0^{-1}$ has a simple quadratic dependence on the single-particle energy.\n*   **The meaning of $\\epsilon_k$**: $\\epsilon_k$ is the dispersion relation of a single, non-interacting particle. It could be $\\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$ for a particle in free space, or a more complex band structure $E_n(k)$ for an electron in a solid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function in momentum-frequency space, $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$, has an inverse linear dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nThis implies that the inverse of the bare Green's function, $G_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n)$, depends linearly on $\\epsilon_k$:\n$G_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n) = i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k + \\mu$\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function ($G_0$) on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ($\\epsilon_k$) is an inverse linear relationship. The inverse of the bare Green's function, $G_0^{-1}$, is a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
