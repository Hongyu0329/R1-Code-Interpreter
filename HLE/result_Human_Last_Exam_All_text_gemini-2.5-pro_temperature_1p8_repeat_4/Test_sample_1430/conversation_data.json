    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\nLet C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3, and let X = C^(15) be its 15th symmetric power. We want to find the range of possible values for ρ(X) = rank(NS(X)).\n\n**Step 1: The Hodge Number h^(1,1)(X) as an Upper Bound**\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group, ρ(X), is the dimension of the space of algebraic cycles of codimension 1 on X modulo algebraic equivalence. By the Lefschetz (1,1) theorem, the image of the Neron-Severi group under the first Chern class map lands in H^(1,1)(X, C) ∩ H^2(X, Z). This implies that ρ(X) is bounded by the Hodge number h^(1,1)(X) = dim_C H^(1,1)(X, C).\nSo, ρ(X) <= h^(1,1)(X).\n\nWe can calculate h^(1,1)(X) using the generating function for the Hodge numbers of symmetric products of a curve, a result due to Macdonald. The generating function for the E-polynomials E(C^(n); u, v) = sum_{p,q} (-1)^(p+q) h^(p,q)(C^(n)) u^p v^q is given by:\n`sum_{n>=0} E(C^(n); u, v) t^n = (1-ut)^g * (1-vt)^g / ((1-t)(1-uvt))`\n\nWe need h^(1,1)(C^(15)). Since h^(p,q) enters the E-polynomial with a factor of (-1)^(p+q), and (-1)^(1+1) = 1, h^(1,1)(C^(n)) is the coefficient of u^1 v^1 t^n in the generating function. Let's compute this coefficient for g=3 and n=15.\n\nThe expression can be expanded as:\n`(sum_{k=0}^inf t^k) * (sum_{j=0}^inf (uvt)^j) * (sum_{p=0}^g C(g,p)(-ut)^p) * (sum_{q=0}^g C(g,q)(-vt)^q)`\n\nA term `u^1 v^1 t^n` can be formed in two ways from the variables j, p, q (where j, p, q >= 0 and p,q <= g):\n1.  j=1, p=0, q=0: The power of u is j+p=1, and the power of v is j+q=1. The coefficient is C(g,0)(-1)^0 * C(g,0)(-1)^0 * 1 = 1. The power of t is k+j+p+q = k+1. For the total power to be n, we need k=n-1. This contributes 1 to the coefficient for any n >= 1.\n2.  j=0, p=1, q=1: The power of u is j+p=1, and the power of v is j+q=1. The coefficient is C(g,1)(-1)^1 * C(g,1)(-1)^1 = (-g) * (-g) = g^2. The power of t is k+j+p+q = k+2. For the total power to be n, we need k=n-2. This contributes g^2 to the coefficient for any n >= 2.\n\nFor n >= 2, the total coefficient of `u^1 v^1 t^n` is 1 + g^2.\nIn our case, g=3 and n=15 (which is >= 2), so:\n`h^(1,1)(X) = h^(1,1)(C^(15)) = 1 + 3^2 = 10.`\nThis gives us the upper bound: `ρ(X) <= 10`.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Smallest Possible Rank**\n\nThe rank ρ(X) depends on the specific choice of the curve C. The minimum value is attained for a \"generic\" curve C in the moduli space of genus 3 curves. For such a curve, its Jacobian J(C) has no non-trivial endomorphisms (End(J(C)) = Z).\n\nThe rank ρ(C^(n)) for a generic curve of genus g has been calculated by Kouvidakis and van der Geer. The generating function for these ranks, ρ_n = ρ(C^(n)), is:\n`sum_{n=0}^inf ρ_n t^n = (1 + t^(g-1)) / ((1-t)(1-t^(2g-2)))`\n\nFor g=3, this becomes:\n`sum_{n=0}^inf ρ_n t^n = (1 + t^2) / ((1-t)(1-t^4)) = (1+t^2) / ((1-t)(1-t^2)(1+t^2)) = 1 / ((1-t)(1-t^2)) = 1 / ((1-t)^2 (1+t))`\n\nWe need to find ρ_15, which is the coefficient of t^15 in this series. Using partial fractions:\n`1 / ((1-t)^2 (1+t)) = (1/4)/(1-t) + (1/2)/(1-t)^2 + (1/4)/(1+t)`\n\nThe coefficient of t^n in this expansion is:\n`ρ_n = (1/4) * 1 + (1/2) * (n+1) + (1/4) * (-1)^n = (1 + 2(n+1) + (-1)^n) / 4 = (2n + 3 + (-1)^n) / 4`\n\nFor n=15:\n`ρ_15 = (2*15 + 3 + (-1)^15) / 4 = (30 + 3 - 1) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8.`\n\nSince the rank can only increase for special curves, this is the minimal possible rank.\nSmallest possible rank = 8.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Largest Possible Rank**\n\nThe largest rank is achieved for a \"special\" curve C. The specialty that maximizes the number of algebraic cycles is complex multiplication (CM).\nThe cohomology group H^2(X, Q), and similarly the space of Hodge cycles H^(1,1)(X, C), has a decomposition into a part pulled back from the Jacobian J(C) via the Abel-Jacobi map, and a 1-dimensional \"standard\" part.\n`h^(1,1)(X) = h^(1,1)(J(C)) + 1`\nFor g=3, `h^(1,1)(J(C)) = g^2 = 9`, so `h^(1,1)(X) = 9 + 1 = 10`, consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nThe 1-dimensional standard part is always generated by an algebraic cycle. The other 9 dimensions of Hodge cycles on X correspond to the 9 dimensions of `H^(1,1)(J(C))`. These cycles on X are algebraic if and only if the corresponding cycles on J(C) are algebraic.\nIt is a known result that for an abelian variety A, all of its (1,1)-Hodge classes are algebraic if and only if A is of CM-type. In this case, `ρ(A) = h^(1,1)(A)`.\n\nFor g=3, there exist curves whose Jacobian is of CM-type. A famous example is the Klein quartic curve `x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0`. For such a curve C, its Jacobian J(C) is of CM-type, and therefore `ρ(J(C)) = h^(1,1)(J(C)) = g^2 = 9`.\n\nFor this special curve C, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of X=C^(15) will be the sum of the ranks from the two parts of the decomposition:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.`\n\nThis rank of 10 achieves the maximum possible value given by the upper bound `h^(1,1)(X)`.\nLargest possible rank = 10.\n\nFinal Answer: The smallest possible rank is 8, and the largest possible rank is 10."
