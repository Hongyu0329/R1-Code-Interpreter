    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry (1S, 2R) tells us the spatial arrangement of the bromo and methyl groups. Substituents with (R,S) or (S,R) configuration on adjacent carbons in a ring are **trans** to each other.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically bulky (hindered) base.\n    *   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol. This is a polar protic solvent, the conjugate acid of the base.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Requirements for an E2 Reaction on a Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism is a concerted, one-step process.\n    *   For the reaction to occur, the leaving group (Bromine) and a proton on an adjacent carbon (a beta-proton) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both the leaving group and the beta-proton must be in **axial** positions. One must be axial-up, and the other must be axial-down.\n\n3.  **Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate:**\n    *   Since the Br and methyl groups are trans, they can exist in two chair conformations in equilibrium: a diequatorial form and a diaxial form.\n    *   **Conformation A (diequatorial):** The Br group is equatorial, and the methyl group is equatorial. Bulky groups prefer the equatorial position to avoid steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions). Therefore, this is the **more stable** and predominant conformation at equilibrium.\n    *   **Conformation B (diaxial):** The Br group is axial, and the methyl group is axial. This conformation is **less stable** due to significant 1,3-diaxial interactions, but it exists in small amounts in equilibrium with Conformation A.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reactive Conformation:**\n    *   The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) to be **axial**.\n    *   In Conformation A, the Br is equatorial, so it cannot undergo an E2 reaction.\n    *   In Conformation B, the Br is axial, so this is the **reactive conformer**. The reaction must proceed through this less stable conformation.\n\n5.  **Identify Available Beta-Protons for Elimination:**\n    *   Let's analyze the reactive conformation (Conformation B) where Br is axial. Let's assume Br is on C1 and is axial-down. Since it's a trans-1,2-disubstituted ring, the methyl group on C2 must be axial-up.\n    *   The beta-carbons (carbons adjacent to C1) are C2 and C6. We need to find an axial proton on either C2 or C6.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is axial-up. This means the other substituent on C2, a hydrogen atom, must be in the **equatorial-down** position. This equatorial H is not anti-periplanar to the axial-down Br. Therefore, **elimination towards C2 cannot occur**.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogen atoms. One is axial-up, and one is equatorial-down. The **axial-up proton on C6** is anti-periplanar to the axial-down Br on C1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The only available beta-proton that meets the strict stereochemical requirement for the E2 reaction is the axial proton on C6.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The bulky base, t-BuOK, will abstract the axial proton from C6.\n    *   Simultaneously, a double bond will form between C1 and C6, and the bromide ion will leave.\n    *   The methyl group on C2 is not involved in the elimination and remains in its position.\n    *   The product formed has a double bond between C1 and C6 and a methyl group on C2. When naming this alkene, the double bond is given priority. Numbering the ring so the double bond is between C1 and C2, the methyl group is located at position 3.\n    *   The name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Stereochemistry is key:** The trans relationship between the Br and methyl groups is crucial.\n*   **E2 requirement:** The anti-periplanar (diaxial) arrangement is a strict geometric constraint that dictates the outcome.\n*   **Reactive conformer:** The reaction proceeds through the less stable chair conformation because it is the only one that satisfies the E2 geometry.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The reaction is highly regioselective, not because of Zaitsev's or Hofmann's rules (base bulkiness), but because of the stereochemical limitations of the substrate. Only one of the two possible elimination pathways is geometrically allowed.\n\nThe product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
