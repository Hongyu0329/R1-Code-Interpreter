    "This problem requires finding the steady-state solution of a Kolmogorov-Chapman system, which describes a continuous-time Markov chain. The steady-state probabilities $p_i = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} P_i(t)$ are found by setting the time derivatives to zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Steady-State Equations:**\n    In the limit as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ approach constant values $p_i$, and their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ approach 0. The given system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n    $$\n    0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1} \\quad (1)\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3} \\quad (2)\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2} \\quad (3)\n    $$\n    $$\n    0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3} \\quad (4)\n    $$\n    The normalization condition must also be satisfied:\n    $$\n    p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1 \\quad (5)\n    $$\n    These five equations for the four unknown probabilities ($p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$) are linearly dependent. We can use equations (1), (3), (4), and (5) to solve for the probabilities.\n\n2.  **Substitute the Given Rate Constants:**\n    We are given the following values for the transition rates:\n    $$\n    \\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008\n    $$\n    Substituting these values into equations (1), (3), and (4):\n    From (1): $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1 \\implies 0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1$\n    From (3): $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2 \\implies 0 = 0.4 p_1 - 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$\n    From (4): $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$\n\n3.  **Solve the System of Equations:**\n    From the equations in step 2, we can establish a relationship between $p_1, p_2,$ and $p_3$:\n    $$\n    p_1 = p_2 = p_3\n    $$\n    Now, we express $p_0$ in terms of $p_1$ using equation (1):\n    $$\n    p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1\n    $$\n    We have now expressed $p_0, p_2,$ and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$. We can use the normalization equation (5) to find the value of $p_1$.\n    $$\n    p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) p_1 = 1\n    $$\n    To combine the terms in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) p_1 = 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) p_1 = 1\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) p_1 = 1\n    $$\n    Solving for $p_1$:\n    $$\n    p_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Quantity:**\n    The question asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, which is $p_0 + p_1$.\n    First, let's find $p_0$ in terms of $p_1$:\n    $$\n    p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}\n    $$\n    Now, we compute the sum $p_0 + p_1$:\n    $$\n    p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}\n    $$\n    $$\n    p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707}\n    $$\n    $$\n    p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}\n    $$\n    Finally, we perform the division to get the numerical answer.\n    $$\n    p_0 + p_1 = 0.946251768...\n    $$\n    Rounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get approximately 0.9463.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Steady-State Assumption:** The core of the problem is to recognize that finding $P_i(+\\infty)$ means solving the steady-state version of the given differential equations where all derivatives are zero.\n*   **Linear Dependence:** The system of rate equations is always linearly dependent. The sum of the derivatives is always zero. Therefore, it is crucial to use the normalization condition $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$ (or $\\sum p_i = 1$ in steady state) to obtain a unique solution.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** The specific numerical values provided for the rates $\\lambda_{ij}$ lead to a significant simplification ($p_1 = p_2 = p_3$). It's important to perform this calculation carefully to leverage this simplification.\n*   **Numerical Accuracy:** The calculations involve fractions and decimals. It is best to keep them as fractions for as long as possible to avoid rounding errors. The final calculation should be performed with a calculator for precision.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$$\n\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.9462517680339463\n$$"
