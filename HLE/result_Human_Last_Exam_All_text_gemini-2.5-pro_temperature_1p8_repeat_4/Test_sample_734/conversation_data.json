    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who?** The question asks for a specific \"Christian theologian.\"\n    *   **What did they do?** They \"first developed specialized terminology.\" This means we are looking for the origin of a specific set of terms or concepts, not just a general discussion.\n    *   **What does the terminology describe?** It describes \"changes in the laws of nature.\" This involves the philosophy of miracles and how God interacts with the created order.\n    *   **What are the applications?** The terminology must be applicable to two distinct theological events:\n        1.  **The virgin birth of Jesus:** A unique, singular miracle that suspends or bypasses the normal biological process of human conception.\n        2.  **Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall:** A systemic, ongoing change in the functioning of the natural world (e.g., introduction of death, decay, predation, thorns) as a consequence of human sin.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   Many theologians (Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, C.S. Lewis) have written about miracles and natural law.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas** developed the distinction between God's *potentia absoluta* (absolute power) and *potentia ordinata* (ordained power), which is relevant but is a more general framework for God's power rather than a specific terminology for how *nature itself* changes.\n    *   **John Calvin** focused on God's continuous, direct providence, where natural laws are simply God's consistent will. A miracle is just God willing something different, rather than an alteration of an inbuilt natural system.\n    *   Modern theologians like **C.S. Lewis** articulated these ideas for a modern audience but were not the *first* to develop the core concepts.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the Key Candidate: Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD)**\n    *   Augustine wrote extensively on creation, providence, and miracles, particularly in works like *The Literal Meaning of Genesis* (*De Genesi ad litteram*) and *The City of God*. He was deeply concerned with how God could act in the world in extraordinary ways without contradicting the good and orderly nature He created.\n    *   He is the primary candidate because he developed a specific, sophisticated conceptual tool to address this exact problem.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Specialized Terminology:**\n    *   The key terminology Augustine developed is the concept of ***rationes seminales*** (in Latin), which translates to **\"seminal reasons,\" \"causal principles,\"** or **\"seed principles.\"**\n    *   **Definition:** Augustine, drawing on Stoic philosophy, proposed that at the initial creation, God embedded these latent potentialities or \"seeds\" for everything that would ever come into being. The normal, predictable course of nature is the slow, orderly unfolding of these principles over time (e.g., an acorn growing into an oak tree).\n\n5.  **Applying the Terminology to the Required Cases:**\n    *   **How it explains changes in natural law:** A miracle, for Augustine, is not God breaking His own laws or creating something entirely *ex nihilo* after the initial creation. Instead, a miracle is God directly and rapidly bringing to fruition a potentiality (a *ratio seminalis*) that was already embedded in creation but would not have emerged through the normal, customary course of nature. Therefore, a miracle is not *contra naturam* (against nature) but *praeter naturam* (beyond the usual course of nature) or *contra consuetudinem naturae* (against the *custom* of nature).\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** According to this framework, God embedded the potential for human life to be generated in a virgin's womb within the \"seminal reasons\" of creation from the very beginning. At the appointed time for the Incarnation, He activated this latent potential. Thus, the virgin birth was not a violation of nature itself, but an extraordinary actualization of a capacity placed within nature by its Creator for this unique purpose.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** The doctrine of *rationes seminales* also provides a framework for understanding how nature could have been altered after the Fall of Man. The original state of creation was \"very good,\" with its seminal reasons unfolding harmoniously. Sin, however, could have acted as a trigger for negative potentialities that were also latent within creationâ€”potentials for death, disease, thorns, thistles, and decay. In this view, the Fall did not involve God rewriting the laws of nature, but rather it caused a corruption in the way the pre-existing seminal principles unfolded, leading to the harsh realities of the current world.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAugustine of Hippo is the theologian who first developed the specialized terminology of ***rationes seminales*** (seminal reasons) to provide a coherent metaphysical explanation for how changes in the natural order could occur. This framework is uniquely capable of accounting for both singular miracles like the virgin birth and systemic alterations to nature, such as those theologians associate with the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
