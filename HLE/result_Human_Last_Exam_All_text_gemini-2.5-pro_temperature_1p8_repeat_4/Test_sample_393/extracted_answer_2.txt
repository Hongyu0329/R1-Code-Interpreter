The number of Tverberg's partitions is given by the formula $\frac{n!}{(\prod_{i=1}^{r} a_i!) (\prod_{j=1}^{k} m_j!)}$, where $n$ is the total number of points, $\{a_1, ..., a_r\}$ is the multiset of the sizes of the parts, and $\{m_1, ..., m_k\}$ is the multiset of frequencies of each distinct size among the $a_i$.
