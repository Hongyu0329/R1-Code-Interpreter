The most likely molecular abnormality is **mosaicism for monosomy X (a 45,X/46,XX karyotype)**. The "normal" karyotype result is likely due to the initial test being performed on a tissue (e.g., blood) that contained a predominance of the normal 46,XX cell line, thus failing to detect the 45,X line responsible for the patient's phenotype.
