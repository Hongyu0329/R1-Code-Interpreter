    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem asks us to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, where $m$ is related to the stable equilibria of the differential equation:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller pieces:\n1.  Find the equilibrium points of the system.\n2.  Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.\n3.  Identify the number of stable equilibria and their values.\n4.  Interpret the definition of $m$ from the problem statement.\n5.  Calculate the final expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n#### Step 1: Find the equilibrium points\n\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let's denote $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe term in the parentheses is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are the equilibrium points:\n*   $x = 0$\n*   $x = 1$\n\nSo, the system has two equilibrium points: $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point\n\nFor a one-dimensional system $x' = f(x)$, an equilibrium point $x^*$ is **stable** if $f'(x^*) < 0$. It is **unstable** if $f'(x^*) > 0$. If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$**:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$**:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around $x=1$.\n\n    Our function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n    Let's consider the sign of $f(x)$ for values of $x$ near 1:\n    *   If $x$ is slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), then $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = -(\\text{pos})(\\text{pos}) = \\text{negative}$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, and solutions starting to the left of 1 will move further to the left (away from 1).\n    *   If $x$ is slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), then $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = -(\\text{pos})(\\text{pos}) = \\text{negative}$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, and solutions starting to the right of 1 will move to the left (towards 1).\n\n    Since solutions approach $x=1$ from the right but move away from it on the left, $x=1$ is a **semi-stable** equilibrium point. A semi-stable point is not considered a stable equilibrium in the standard definition.\n\n#### Step 3: Interpret the value of $m$\n\nThe problem states, \"Suppose that $m$ is a number of stable equilibrium\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could mean:\na) $m$ is the *count* of stable equilibria.\nb) $m$ is the *value* of a stable equilibrium point.\n\nLet's analyze the wording. The use of the singular noun \"equilibrium\" rather than the plural \"equilibria\" strongly suggests that we are talking about a value. If it meant the count, the phrasing would likely be \"the number of stable equilibria\". \"a number of stable equilibrium\" can be interpreted as \"a number which is a stable equilibrium\".\n\nFrom our stability analysis, we found that there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nSince there is only one stable equilibrium, its value is unique. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that $m$ refers to this value.\nTherefore, $m = 0$.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate the final expression\n\nWe need to compute $m - 2^{4048}$.\nUsing our deduced value of $m=0$:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 0 - 2^{4048} = -2^{4048} $$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Finding all equilibria:** Make sure to find all roots of $f(x)=0$. Factoring is key here.\n*   **Stability Test:** Remember the condition for stability is $f'(x^*)<0$. If $f'(x^*)=0$, you must use other methods like analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of the equilibrium point or checking higher-order derivatives.\n*   **Definition of Stability:** A stable equilibrium must attract solutions from both sides. A semi-stable equilibrium, which attracts from one side and repels from the other, is not classified as stable.\n*   **Interpreting the question:** The phrasing \"a number of stable equilibrium\" is unusual. Careful reading and grammatical analysis (singular \"equilibrium\") are crucial to determining whether $m$ is a count or a value. The uniqueness of the stable equilibrium point resolves the ambiguity of \"a number\".\n\nFollowing this detailed analysis, we arrive at the final answer."
