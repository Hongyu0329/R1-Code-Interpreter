    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the historically latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist and Her Work**\nThe question concerns the paintings of Lady Elizabeth Butler (1846–1933), a renowned British painter famous for her detailed and dramatic military scenes. To answer the question, we must identify her paintings that depict specific battles and the historical dates of those battles.\n\n**Step 2: List Key Paintings by Lady Butler and the Events They Depict**\nWe need to create a list of Lady Butler's significant works and find the date of the historical event portrayed in each. It is important to distinguish the date the painting was made from the date of the event itself.\n\n*   ***A Lament after the Battle of Aughrim***: Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Aughrim, which took place on **July 12, 1691**.\n*   ***Quatre Bras*** (1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which was fought on **June 16, 1815**, two days before Waterloo.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, which occurred on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (1879): Shows Dr. William Brydon arriving at Jalalabad in **January 1842**, the sole European survivor of the 1842 retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (1874): Portrays an infantry roll call after the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle was fought on **November 5, 1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (1876): Depicts the survivors of the Charge of the Light Brigade, which happened during the Battle of Balaclava on **October 25, 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (1880): Illustrates the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War, which took place from **January 22-23, 1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (1882): Depicts an incident involving Lieutenants Robert Elwes and Edward Littleton at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War on **January 28, 1881**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (c. 1891): Depicts the Nile Expedition of **1884–1885**, which was a campaign to relieve Major-General Charles Gordon at Khartoum during the Mahdist War.\n*   ***Omdurman*** (c. 1898-1899): Shows the advance of the 21st Lancers after their charge at the Battle of Omdurman, the decisive battle of the Mahdist War, on **September 2, 1898**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates of the Battles**\nNow, let's list the dates of the depicted battles/events in chronological order to identify the latest one.\n\n1.  Battle of Aughrim: **1691**\n2.  Battle of Quatre Bras/Waterloo: **1815**\n3.  Retreat from Kabul: **1842**\n4.  Crimean War (Balaclava/Inkerman): **1854**\n5.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n6.  Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n7.  Nile Expedition: **1884-1885**\n8.  Battle of Omdurman: **1898**\n\n**Step 4: Identify Careful Points and Final Conclusion**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Battle vs. General Event.** Lady Butler also painted scenes that were not specific battles, such as *A Khaki November, London, 1918*, which depicts the end of World War I. While this is the latest historical *event* she painted (1918), the question specifically asks for a *battle*. The scene from 1918 is not a depiction of combat.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Date of Painting vs. Date of Event.** It is crucial not to confuse when the painting was made with when the event happened. For example, *The Remnants of an Army* was painted in 1879, but the event it shows is from 1842.\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the chronological comparison, the Battle of Omdurman, which took place on September 2, 1898, is the latest historically dated *battle* depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n<<<The Battle of Omdurman>>>"
