    "This problem is a classic extension of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a system of three functions and three spaces, leading to the concept of a tripled fixed point. Let's break it down methodically.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correction of the Function Definitions:** The question states the functions as `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. This contains a likely typo, as `G` is defined twice with different domains and there is no function `H` mentioned, despite the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". In the standard theory of tripled fixed points, the mappings are typically defined with permuted variables as follows:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Z → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × X × Y → Z`\n    We will proceed with this standard definition, as it aligns with the terminology used. The notation `*` will be interpreted as the Cartesian product `×`.\n\n2.  **Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** Given the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` as defined above, an **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the system of equations:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, z) = y`\n    *   `H(z, x, y) = z`\n    Note the specific order of variables in the arguments of `G` and `H`, which is crucial.\n\n3.  **The Mathematical Framework:** To guarantee the existence of such a point, we need to work within the framework of **complete metric spaces**. The conditions will be based on a generalization of the Banach Contraction Principle.\n    *   **Spaces:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be endowed with metrics, let's call them `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z` respectively. Furthermore, `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**. A space is complete if every Cauchy sequence in it converges to a point within that space.\n    *   **Operator Formulation:** The problem can be simplified by defining a single operator `T` on the product space `W = X × Y × Z`. A fixed point of `T` will correspond to the FGH-tripled fixed point. The operator `T` is defined as:\n        `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, z), H(z, x, y))`\n        An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is a point such that `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`.\n\n4.  **The Contractive Condition:** The core of the conditions is that the operator `T` must be a **contraction mapping** on the product space `W`. For this to be true, the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy a joint contractive condition.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Conditions\n\nLet's formally state the conditions required by the relevant fixed-point theorem.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the Space**\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be three **complete metric spaces**.\n*   Consider the product space `W = X × Y × Z`. We can define a metric on `W`, for instance, the sum metric:\n    `d_W((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    If `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete, then `(W, d_W)` is also a complete metric space.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Mappings**\n*   Let `F: X × Y × Z → X`, `G: Y × X × Z → Y`, and `H: Z × X × Y → Z` be the three functions.\n\n**Step 3: State the Joint Contractive Condition**\nThe existence of a tripled fixed point is guaranteed if `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy a specific type of contractive inequality. There must exist non-negative constants `α_i, β_i, γ_i` for `i ∈ {1, 2, 3}` such that the following inequalities hold for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1, z2 ∈ Z`:\n\n1.  `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α₁·d_X(x1, x2) + β₁·d_Y(y1, y2) + γ₁·d_Z(z1, z2)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y1, x1, z1), G(y2, x2, z2)) ≤ α₂·d_Y(y1, y2) + β₂·d_X(x1, x2) + γ₂·d_Z(z1, z2)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z1, x1, y1), H(z2, x2, y2)) ≤ α₃·d_Z(z1, z2) + β₃·d_X(x1, x2) + γ₃·d_Y(y1, y2)`\n\n**Step 4: State the Condition on the Contraction Constants**\nFor the combined mapping `T` to be a contraction on the product space `W`, the constants from Step 3 must satisfy:\n`max { (α₁ + β₂ + β₃), (β₁ + α₂ + γ₃), (γ₁ + γ₂ + α₃) } < 1`\n\n**Conclusion: The Tripled Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nCombining these steps gives us the full set of conditions. A version of the Tripled Fixed-Point Theorem states:\n\n*If `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces, and the mappings `F`, `G`, `H` satisfy the joint contractive inequalities from Step 3 with constants that fulfill the condition in Step 4, then `F`, `G`, and `H` have a **unique** FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z`.*\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\nIn short, the two main conditions are:\n1.  **Topological Condition:** The domains `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Analytical Condition:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must jointly satisfy a specific set of contractive inequalities.\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n1.  **Space Requirement:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces with respective metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n2.  **Contraction Requirement:** There must exist nine non-negative constants (`α₁`, `β₁`, `γ₁`, `α₂`, `β₂`, `γ₂`, `α₃`, `β₃`, `γ₃`) such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following three inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, z₁), G(y₂, x₂, z₂)) ≤ α₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + β₂·d_X(x₁, x₂) + γ₂·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, x₁, y₁), H(z₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ α₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + β₃·d_X(x₁, x₂) + γ₃·d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n\n    Furthermore, these constants must satisfy the condition:\n    *   `max { (α₁ + β₂ + β₃), (β₁ + α₂ + γ₃), (γ₁ + γ₂ + α₃) } < 1`\nUnder these conditions, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point exists.>>>"
