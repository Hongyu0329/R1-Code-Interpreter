    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understanding the Conditions**\n\nLet $N = 100000$. We are given a sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N \\in [0,1]$.\nWe need to determine if there exists a sequence of real numbers $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_N$ that satisfies two properties:\n1.  All $x_i$ must lie in the closed interval $[-L, L]$, where $L = 1 - 10^{-M}$. That is, $x_i \\in [-1+10^{-M}, 1-10^{-M}]$ for all $i=0, 1, \\dots, N$.\n2.  The absolute difference between consecutive terms must be $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ for all $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest positive integer $M$ for which such a sequence $x_i$ is guaranteed to exist for *any* choice of the sequence $a_i$.\n\n**2. Rewriting the Second Condition**\n\nThe condition $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ implies that $x_i = x_{i-1} + a_i$ or $x_i = x_{i-1} - a_i$. We can represent this choice using a sequence of signs $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\dots, \\sigma_N \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\nThus, for a given starting point $x_0$ and a sequence of signs $\\sigma_i$, the sequence $x_i$ is constructed as:\n$x_k = x_{i-1} + \\sigma_i a_i$.\nThis means any term $x_k$ can be expressed in terms of $x_0$ and the partial sum of the signed $a_i$ values:\n$x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i a_i$.\nLet's define the partial sums $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i a_i$ for $k=1, \\dots, N$, and let $S_0=0$.\nThen the sequence is defined by $x_k = x_0 + S_k$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, N$.\n\n**3. Combining the Conditions**\n\nNow, we substitute this into the first condition: for a given sequence $a_i$, we need to find if there exist an initial value $x_0$ and a sequence of signs $\\sigma_i$ such that:\n$-L \\le x_0 + S_k \\le L$ for all $k = 0, 1, \\dots, N$.\n\nThis is a set of inequalities for $x_0$:\n$-L - S_k \\le x_0 \\le L - S_k$ for all $k$.\n\nFor such an $x_0$ to exist, the overall lower bound must be less than or equal to the overall upper bound:\n$\\max_{k} (-L - S_k) \\le \\min_{k} (L - S_k)$.\n\nLet's denote $S_{\\max} = \\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$ and $S_{\\min} = \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$. The inequality becomes:\n$-L - S_{\\min} \\le L - S_{\\max}$.\n\nRearranging this gives:\n$S_{\\max} - S_{\\min} \\le 2L$.\n\nThe term $R(\\sigma) = S_{\\max} - S_{\\min}$ is the range of the partial sums for a specific choice of signs $\\sigma = (\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_N)$.\n\n**4. The Core Problem in Discrepancy Theory**\n\nFor a given sequence of $a_i$, we need to find if there is *at least one* choice of signs $\\sigma_i$ that satisfies the condition. This means we should choose the signs to make the range as small as possible. The condition for the existence of the $x_i$ sequence is therefore:\n$\\min_{\\sigma} R(\\sigma) \\le 2L$.\n\nThis must hold for *any* sequence $a_i \\in [0,1]$. This means the interval $[-L, L]$ must be large enough to accommodate the worst-case scenario. The worst case is the sequence $a_i$ which maximizes the minimum possible range. Let's define this value as:\n$W_N = \\sup_{a_1, \\dots, a_N \\in [0,1]} \\left( \\min_{\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_N \\in \\{-1,1\\}} R(\\sigma) \\right)$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest positive integer $M$ that satisfies:\n$W_N \\le 2L = 2(1-10^{-M})$.\n\n**5. Finding the Value of $W_N$**\n\nThe value $W_N$ is a known result from the field of discrepancy theory. It represents the maximum possible minimum range of partial sums for a sequence of length $N$.\nA result by S. A. Sevast'yanov states that for a sequence of numbers in $[0,1]$ of length $n$:\n$W_n = 2 - \\frac{2}{n}$ if $n$ is even.\n$W_n = 2 - \\frac{2}{n+1}$ if $n$ is odd.\n\nIn our problem, $N=100000$, which is an even number.\nTherefore, the value of $W_{100000}$ is:\n$W_{100000} = 2 - \\frac{2}{100000} = 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-5}$.\n\n**6. Solving for M**\n\nNow we substitute this value back into our inequality:\n$W_N \\le 2(1-10^{-M})$\n$2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-5} \\le 2(1-10^{-M})$\n$2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-5} \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$\n\nDividing by 2 and simplifying:\n$1 - 10^{-5} \\le 1 - 10^{-M}$\n$-10^{-5} \\le -10^{-M}$\n\nMultiplying by -1 reverses the inequality sign:\n$10^{-5} \\ge 10^{-M}$\n\nSince the function $f(y) = 10^y$ is increasing, we can compare the exponents directly (alternatively, take $\\log_{10}$ of both sides):\n$-5 \\ge -M$\n\nMultiplying by -1 again reverses the inequality sign:\n$5 \\le M$\n\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer $M$ that satisfies this condition. The smallest integer $M$ that is greater than or equal to 5 is 5.\n\nTo check, if $M=5$, the condition $5 \\le 5$ holds.\nIf we chose a smaller integer, e.g., $M=4$, the condition $5 \\le 4$ would be false. This means for $M=4$, there would exist at least one sequence $a_i$ for which no corresponding sequence $x_i$ could be found in the required interval.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer is $M=5$."
