Yes, the theory can not hold. The original inversion process is based on the transmission matrix T of a random medium that is implicitly assumed to be non-birefringent (scalar in its effect on polarization). Introducing a birefringent medium transforms the system into one where polarization states are actively mixed (a vector system). The original scalar inverse matrix T⁻¹ does not contain the information needed to reverse this new polarization-mixing effect, causing the inversion theory to fail.
