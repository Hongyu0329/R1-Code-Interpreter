    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Components**\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information and terminology in the context of a fuzzy inference system.\n*   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set:** This is a highly complex type of fuzzy set used to model extreme levels of uncertainty. However, the problem provides crisp numerical values, suggesting a significant simplification for this specific calculation.\n*   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: This represents the firing strength or degree of fulfillment of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th fuzzy rule for a given input `x′`. It's a scalar value between 0 and 1 that indicates how true the premise of the rule is.\n*   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: This is the membership degree of a specific output value `y_j` in the fuzzy set `G_k_j`, which is the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the k-th rule. It represents the value of the original, unmodified consequent fuzzy set at that point.\n*   **t-norm operation**: This is a type of fuzzy logic operator that models the logical \"AND\". It is used in the implication step to combine the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's fuzzy set. Common t-norms include Minimum, Product, and Łukasiewicz.\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the \"Rule Activation Level\"**\n\nThe term \"rule activation level\" refers to the result of the fuzzy implication process. In this process, the firing strength of the rule's antecedent is used to scale or clip the rule's consequent fuzzy set. The result is the \"activated\" or \"fired\" output fuzzy set for that single rule. The question asks for the value of this activated set at the point `y_j`.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the t-norm Operation**\n\nThe value of the activated consequent fuzzy set at point `y_j` is calculated by applying the t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the original consequent membership value.\n\n*   `Activated Membership = t_norm ( Phi_k(x′) , μG_k_j(y_j) )`\n\nSince the problem does not specify which t-norm to use, we will use the most common one for fuzzy implication: the **Minimum (min)** t-norm. This corresponds to the clipping method in Mamdani-type inference systems.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula using the Minimum t-norm:\n\n*   `Activated Membership = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   `Activated Membership = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Simplification of Type-3 Fuzzy Logic:** The core challenge here is the term \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\". In a true IT3 system, the firing strength and memberships would not be simple crisp numbers like 0.7 and 0.9. They would be interval type-2 fuzzy sets, making the calculation vastly more complex. The problem simplifies this to a level equivalent to a Type-1 fuzzy system for the purpose of the calculation, which is a necessary assumption to find a numerical answer.\n2.  **Ambiguity of \"t-norm\":** The term \"t-norm\" refers to a class of functions. While the Minimum t-norm is the standard choice in this context (Mamdani inference), other t-norms like the Product t-norm (`0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`) would yield a different result. The choice of the Minimum t-norm is based on it being the most common and standard implementation.\n3.  **Antecedent vs. Consequent:** The \"activation level\" could be misconstrued as only the antecedent's firing strength (`0.7`). However, the request to use a t-norm and the inclusion of the consequent's membership value `μG_k_j(y_j)` indicates that the question is asking for the result of the implication step, which modifies the consequent.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the rule activation level at the specified point is the result of combining the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership using a standard t-norm.\n\n*   **Antecedent Firing Strength:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   **Consequent Membership:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n*   **Operation:** `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Result:** `0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
