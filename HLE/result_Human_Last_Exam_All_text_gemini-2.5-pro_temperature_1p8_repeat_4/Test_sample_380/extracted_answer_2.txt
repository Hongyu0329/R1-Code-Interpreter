The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered to be radial due to the Parker Spiral nature of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). The practice of using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z) to calculate the normalized magnetic helicity is an approximation. This approximation is only valid under the specific condition of a "quasi-radial" IMF, where the local magnetic field happens to be closely aligned with the Sun-spacecraft (radial) line. Researchers often deliberately select these time intervals for analysis to simplify calculations. For a general case, the physically correct method is to transform the data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system and use the components perpendicular to the local magnetic field vector.
