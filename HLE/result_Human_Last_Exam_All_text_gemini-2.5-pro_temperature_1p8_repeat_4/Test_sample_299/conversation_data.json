    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$. We want to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted as $|S|$.\n\n**1. Initial properties of *f***\n\n*   **Injectivity**: First, we determine if $f$ is injective (one-to-one). Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. Using the given equation, this implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function $g(x)=e^x$ is strictly increasing and thus injective, we must have $x_1=x_2$. Therefore, $f$ is injective.\n\n*   **Monotonicity**: A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is injective must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: We must analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**2. Case 1: *f* is strictly decreasing**\n\n*   Let's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n*   Consider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$. As a difference of continuous functions, $g(x)$ is continuous.\n*   Since $f$ is a strictly decreasing function defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, its limits at infinity exist (possibly as $\\pm \\infty$). Let $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = L$ and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = M$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $L$ is the infimum and $M$ is the supremum of the range of $f$. It could be that $L=-\\infty$ and/or $M=\\infty$.\n*   Let's analyze the limits of $g(x)$:\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} (f(x) - x) = L - \\infty = -\\infty$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} (f(x) - x) = M - (-\\infty) = \\infty$.\n*   Since $g(x)$ is a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ that takes values from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x_0)=0$. This means $f(x_0) - x_0 = 0$, so $f(x_0) = x_0$. This point $x_0$ is a fixed point of $f$.\n*   If $f$ has a fixed point $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n*   Substituting this into the original equation gives $e^{x_0} = x_0$.\n*   **Careful Point**: We need to know if the equation $e^x=x$ has any real solutions. The function $h(x) = e^x - x$ has derivative $h'(x) = e^x-1$. The derivative is zero at $x=0$. The minimum value of $h(x)$ is $h(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. Since the minimum value is 1, $h(x)$ is always positive, and $e^x=x$ has no real solutions.\n*   This is a contradiction. The assumption that $f$ is strictly decreasing leads to the conclusion that $e^x=x$ must have a solution, which it does not.\n*   Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**3. Case 2: *f* is strictly increasing**\n\n*   Now we analyze the case where $f$ is strictly increasing.\n*   Let $I = \\text{range}(f)$. Since $f$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $I$ is an open interval $(a, b)$, where $a=\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(x)$ and $b=\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)$.\n*   The equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ tells us that the range of the composition $f \\circ f$ is the range of $e^x$, which is $(0, \\infty)$.\n*   The range of $f \\circ f$ is $f(I)$. So, $f(I) = f((a,b)) = (0, \\infty)$.\n*   Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $f((a,b)) = (\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y), \\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y))$.\n*   Thus, we must have $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$.\n*   From $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$, since $f$ is an increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its argument must approach $\\infty$. This means we cannot have a finite $b$, as $f$ would not be defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$. So, $b=\\infty$.\n*   With $b=\\infty$, the range of $f$ is $I=(a, \\infty)$.\n*   Also, from $f(I)=(0, \\infty)$, we know that for any $y \\in (a,\\infty)$, we have $f(y)>0$. The range of $f$ is $(a, \\infty)$, so for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f(x)>a$. This means that $f(y) > 0$ for any $y > a$.\n*   Now we determine the value of $a$. The limit $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = 0$. By continuity of $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, if $a$ is a real number, we can say $f(a) = \\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = 0$.\n    *   If $a > 0$, then $f(a) > a$ must hold since $f$'s range is $(a, \\infty)$. But we found $f(a)=0$. So we would have $0 > a$, which contradicts $a>0$. So $a$ cannot be positive.\n    *   If $a \\le 0$, the contradiction is avoided. For $a=0$, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(x)=0$. For $a<0$, we have $f(a)=0$.\n*   So, $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function mapping $\\mathbb{R}$ to $(a, \\infty)$ where $a \\le 0$.\n\n**4. Construction and Cardinality of Increasing Solutions**\n\nSolutions exist for this class of functional equations. We can determine the cardinality of the set of solutions by looking at the degrees of freedom in constructing such a function. A general method is to define the function on a suitable interval and use the functional equation to extend it to the entire domain.\n\nLet's focus on the case $a=0$ for simplicity (the argument for $a<0$ is analogous and gives the same cardinality).\n*   $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to (0, \\infty)$ is strictly increasing and continuous, with $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n*   Let $c=f(0)$. Since the range of $f$ is $(0,\\infty)$, we have $c>0$.\n*   From the main equation, $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$, so $f(c)=1$.\n*   We can analyze the value of $c$.\n    *   If $c=1$, then $f(0)=1$ and $f(1)=1$. Since $f$ is *strictly* increasing, this is not possible.\n    *   If $c>1$, then since $f$ is strictly increasing, $0<1<c$ implies $f(0)<f(1)<f(c)$, which means $c < f(1) < 1$. This contradicts $c>1$.\n    *   If $0<c<1$, then $0<c<1$ implies $f(0)<f(c)$, which means $c<1$. This is consistent.\n*   So for any solution, we must have $f(0)=c$ for some $c \\in (0,1)$, and $f(c)=1$.\n*   The function $f$ restricted to the interval $[0, c]$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps $[0, c]$ onto $[f(0), f(c)] = [c, 1]$. Let's call this restriction $h$, so $h: [0,c] \\to [c,1]$.\n\nThe construction proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Choose a parameter `c`**: We can choose any $c \\in (0,1)$. The set of choices for $c$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n2.  **Choose a function `h`**: For a fixed $c$, we can choose any continuous, strictly increasing bijection $h: [0,c] \\to [c,1]$. The function $f$ is defined as $f(x)=h(x)$ for $x\\in[0,c]$.\n3.  **Extend `f`**: The function $f$ is now determined everywhere else by the equation $f(x)=e^{f^{-1}(x)}$. For example, for $x \\in [c,1]$, we have $x=h(t)$ for some $t \\in [0,c]$, so $f(x)=f(h(t))=f(f(t))=e^t=e^{h^{-1}(x)}$. One can show that this process uniquely defines a valid solution on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Careful Point**: We need to find the cardinality of the set of possible functions $h$ for a given $c$.\n*   The set of such functions $h: [0,c] \\to [c,1]$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of continuous increasing bijections from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$.\n*   A continuous function on a closed interval is determined by its values on a countable dense subset (like the rational numbers). The set of possible choices for these values is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q}}$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. Thus, the number of such functions is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   To show the number is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$, we can note that we have the freedom to choose the value $h(c/2)$ to be any number in the open interval $(c, 1)$. This freedom of choice from a set of size $\\mathfrak{c}$ is enough to create $\\mathfrak{c}$ different functions.\n*   So, for each choice of $c$, there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the function $h$.\n\nThe total number of increasing solutions is the number of choices for $c$ times the number of choices for $h$. This gives $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\n\n(A similar analysis for the case $a<0$ also yields $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions. The total number of increasing solutions is the union of these sets, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}+\\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.)\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The set of solutions can be partitioned into increasing and decreasing functions.\n*   The set of decreasing solutions is empty.\n*   The set of increasing solutions has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Therefore, the cardinality of the set of all such functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe cardinality of the continuum is often denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
