    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, which is another term for a 2D square grid. Let's denote this number by a(n) for an n-step walk.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:**\n    *   **Manhattan Lattice (Square Lattice):** A grid of points (x, y) where x and y are integers.\n    *   **Walk:** A sequence of points starting at the origin (0,0). At each step, we move from the current point to one of its four adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, or right).\n    *   **n-step Walk:** A walk consisting of n moves.\n    *   **Self-avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point more than once. The path cannot cross itself.\n    *   **a(n):** The total count of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from the origin.\n\n2.  **Calculate the first few terms to understand the process:**\n    *   **a(1):**\n        *   Starting at (0,0), we have 4 possible first steps: to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1).\n        *   All 4 are distinct and self-avoiding.\n        *   So, **a(1) = 4**.\n\n    *   **a(2):**\n        *   Consider each of the 4 paths of length 1. For each path, we take another step.\n        *   For example, from the path (0,0) -> (1,0), the next step can be to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1). We cannot go back to (0,0). So, there are 3 valid choices.\n        *   By symmetry, each of the 4 initial paths has 3 valid extensions.\n        *   So, **a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12**.\n\n    *   **a(3):**\n        *   This gets more complex. We need to consider the types of paths of length 2.\n        *   **Type 1: \"Straight\" paths.** Example: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). There are 4 such paths. From (2,0), we can't go to (1,0), leaving 3 valid moves. All are valid SAWs. This gives 4 * 3 = 12 paths.\n        *   **Type 2: \"Bent\" paths.** Example: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1). There are 8 such paths (4 initial moves * 2 turning choices). From (1,1), we can't go to (1,0). The other 3 possible moves are to (2,1), (1,2), and (0,1). None of these points have been visited yet. So, there are 3 valid extensions. This gives 8 * 3 = 24 paths.\n        *   Total paths: **a(3) = 12 + 24 = 36**.\n\n    *   **a(4):**\n        *   The calculation becomes increasingly complex because some paths can now lead back to the origin or another previously visited point (other than the immediate predecessor). For instance, the path (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) brings the walk adjacent to the origin. The next step from (0,1) cannot be back to (1,1). The other 3 options are (0,2), (-1,1), and (0,0). Since (0,0) has already been visited, only 2 extensions are valid for this specific type of path.\n        *   A full casework analysis (or a computer program) reveals **a(4) = 100**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Sequence and Find a(10):**\n    *   There is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). The problem of counting SAWs is famously difficult.\n    *   However, the sequence of values for a(n) is well-known and has been computed for many terms. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n    *   Let's list the known values up to n=10:\n        *   a(1) = 4\n        *   a(2) = 12\n        *   a(3) = 36\n        *   a(4) = 100\n        *   a(5) = 284\n        *   a(6) = 780\n        *   a(7) = 2,172\n        *   a(8) = 5,916\n        *   a(9) = 16,268\n        *   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, a(10), is a known combinatorial value. Based on the established sequence of these numbers, the value is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
