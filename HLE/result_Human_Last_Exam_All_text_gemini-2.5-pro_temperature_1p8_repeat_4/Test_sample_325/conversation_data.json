    "This problem asks for the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object of study - the curve.**\nThe curve is a segment of a helix in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We need to check if it's \"non-degenerate\", which is a key condition for the applicability of major decoupling theorems. A curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is non-degenerate if its first $d$ derivatives are linearly independent. For $d=3$, this means we must check if $\\det(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)) \\neq 0$.\nLet's compute the derivatives:\n*   $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$\n*   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n*   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n*   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\nNow, we compute the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors:\n$\\det(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)) = \\begin{vmatrix} -\\sin t & -\\cos t & \\sin t \\\\ \\cos t & -\\sin t & -\\cos t \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{vmatrix}$\nExpanding along the third row:\n$= 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -\\cos t & \\sin t \\\\ -\\sin t & -\\cos t \\end{vmatrix} = (-\\cos t)(-\\cos t) - (\\sin t)(-\\sin t) = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nSince the determinant is 1 (and thus non-zero) for all $t$, the curve is non-degenerate. This means that the decoupling exponents for this curve are the same as for the moment curve $\\Gamma(t) = (t, t^2, t^3)$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the decoupling inequality and the \"sharp exponent\".**\nThe $l^2$ decoupling problem studies how the $L^p$ norm of a function $f$ relates to the $L^2$ norms of its constituent pieces $f_I$. The function $f$ is assumed to have its Fourier transform supported in a small $\\delta$-neighborhood of the curve, $N_\\delta(\\gamma)$. This neighborhood is then partitioned into smaller regions $\\theta_I$, and $f_I$ are the parts of $f$ corresponding to these regions (i.e., $\\hat{f_I} = \\hat{f}|_{\\theta_I}$).\n\nFor a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, a crucial framework developed by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth involves partitioning the parameter interval $[0,1]$ into smaller intervals $I$ of length $\\delta$. The regions $\\theta_I$ are then the $\\delta$-neighborhoods of the corresponding curve segments, $\\gamma(I)$. The sharp $l^2 \\to L^p$ decoupling inequality, for arbitrary functions $f_I$ with Fourier support in $\\theta_I$, takes the form:\n$$ \\left\\|\\sum_{I} f_I\\right\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb R^d)}\\lesssim_\\epsilon \\delta^{\\beta(p)-\\epsilon}\\left(\\sum_{I}\\|f_I\\|_{L^2(\\mathbb R^d)}^2\\right)^{1/2} $$\nThe \"sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent\" is the value $\\beta(p)$ in this inequality. This inequality is known to be sharp up to the $\\delta^\\epsilon$ factor.\n\n**Step 3: State the theorem for the sharp exponent.**\nAccording to the definitive results in the field (e.g., Theorem 1.2 in Ciprian Demeter's book \"Decoupling\"), for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, this inequality holds for the range of exponents $p \\in [2, d(d+1)]$. The sharp exponent is given by the formula:\n$$ \\beta(p) = \\frac{d(d-1)}{8} - \\frac{d(d-1)}{4p} $$\n\n**Step 4: Apply the theorem to the specific case.**\nWe are in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so the dimension $d=3$. The range of validity for $p$ is $[2, 3(3+1)] = [2, 12]$. The formula for the exponent becomes:\n$$ \\beta(p) = \\frac{3(3-1)}{8} - \\frac{3(3-1)}{4p} = \\frac{6}{8} - \\frac{6}{4p} = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{2p} $$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the specific value of the exponent.**\nThe question asks for \"the\" sharp exponent, using a definite article, which suggests a single numerical answer rather than a function of $p$. In such contexts, this typically refers to the exponent at the most significant critical value of $p$. For the modern theory of decoupling for curves, the most important endpoint is $p = d(d+1)$, which is the critical exponent in the Bourgain-Demeter-Guth theorem that led to the resolution of the Vinogradov Mean Value Theorem.\nFor $d=3$, this critical endpoint is $p = 12$.\n\nWe evaluate the exponent $\\beta(p)$ at $p=12$:\n$$ \\beta(12) = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 12} = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{24} = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\beta(12) = \\frac{6}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{5}{8} $$\n\nThus, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent at the critical value $p=12$ is $5/8$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{8}}$.\n\n<<<5/8>>>"
