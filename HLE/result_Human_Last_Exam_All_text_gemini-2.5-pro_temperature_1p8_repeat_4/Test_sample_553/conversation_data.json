    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question:**\n    *   **\"Tonic chord\"**: This is the first chord in a key, also known as the \"I\" chord. It's the \"home\" base of the song, providing a sense of rest and resolution. For example, in the key of G major, the tonic is a G major chord.\n    *   **\"Minor fifth chord\"**: This is the more complex part of the question.\n        *   The \"fifth\" refers to the fifth note of the scale. In the key of G major, the fifth note is D.\n        *   Normally, in a major key, the chord built on the fifth note is a *major* chord (the V chord, or dominant), which has a strong pull back to the tonic. So in G major, the V chord would be D major.\n        *   A \"minor fifth chord\" (spelled with a lowercase Roman numeral, \"v\") means the chord built on this fifth note is a *minor* chord. In our G major example, this would be a D minor chord. This is an unconventional chord in a major key; it's typically \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key (e.g., G minor) to create a more wistful or sad feeling. This technique is known as modal interchange.\n    *   **\"Chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\"**: This means the song must begin with the I chord and immediately move to the v chord. The progression is **I -> v**.\n\n2.  **Search for a Beatles Song That Fits This Pattern:**\n    We need to think of Beatles songs and their opening chord progressions.\n\n    *   Does it happen in G major? We would need a song in G major that starts with G major -> D minor. \"Yesterday\" starts with G major, but its second chord is Em7 (the vi chord), not D minor.\n    *   Does it happen in C major? We'd look for C major -> G minor. \"Something\" starts with C -> F.\n    *   Does it happen in A major? This would mean a progression from **A major -> E minor**. Let's examine songs in this key.\n\n3.  **Identify the Correct Song: \"I'll Be Back\"**\n    Let's analyze the opening of the song \"I'll Be Back\" from the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n\n    *   **Key**: The song is in the key of A major. Therefore, the tonic (I) chord is **A major**.\n    *   **Fifth Chord**: The fifth note of the A major scale is E. The standard dominant (V) chord would be E major. The minor fifth (v) chord would be **E minor**.\n    *   **Opening Progression**: The song starts immediately on an **A major** chord as John Lennon sings the first line, \"You know if you break my heart...\". On the word \"go\" (\"...I'll go...\"), the chord changes decisively to an **E minor** chord.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The opening progression is A major -> E minor, which is a perfect example of a jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth (v) chord.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Unusual Harmony**: The I -> v progression is not a standard functional harmony in a major key. This non-diatonic (out-of-key) chord is what makes the opening of \"I'll Be Back\" so distinctive and melancholy. It sets the plaintive tone for the rest of the song.\n*   **Starting Point**: The question specifies the song *starts* with this progression. The jump must happen in the introductory bars, which it does in \"I'll Be Back\".\n*   **Distinguishing from other Progressions**: It's important not to confuse the v chord (minor fifth) with other minor chords in the key, such as the ii (supertonic minor), iii (mediant minor), or vi (submediant minor), which are all common. The minor fifth is a special, borrowed sound.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the song that fits the description perfectly is \"I'll Be Back\".\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
