    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Framing the Problem with Large Deviation Theory**\n\nThe core idea of large deviation theory (LDT) in statistical mechanics is that the probability `P` of observing a system in a particular macroscopic state is exponentially small in the system size (`N` or Volume `V`), governed by a rate function `I`.\n`P(macrostate) ≈ exp[-N * I(macrostate)]`\nThe equilibrium state is the most probable macrostate, which corresponds to the state that minimizes the rate function `I`.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem Connection:** This theorem deals with the large deviations of an empirical measure. It states that the rate function is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence `D(ν || q)` between the observed empirical measure `ν` and an a priori measure `q`. In statistical mechanics, this connects to Boltzmann's principle, `S = k_B ln(W)`, where `W` is the number of microstates corresponding to a macrostate. Minimizing the rate function `I` is equivalent to maximizing the entropy `S`, as the rate function can be identified with the negative of the entropy density, `I = -S/(k_B N)`. Thus, finding the equilibrium state means we must find the configuration that maximizes entropy.\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem Connection:** This theorem concerns the large deviations of the sample mean of i.i.d. random variables. It establishes a relationship between the rate function `I(u)` for the mean `u` and the log-moment generating function `Λ(β)` via a Legendre-Fenchel transform: `I(u) = sup_β {βu - Λ(β)}`. In thermodynamics, this mathematical structure is mirrored in the Legendre transform relationships between thermodynamic potentials, such as entropy, free energy, and the partition function. The log of the partition function, `ln(Z)`, plays a role analogous to `Λ(β)`.\n\nOur approach will be to first maximize the entropy of the system (the Sanov approach) and then show its consistency with the partition function formalism (the Cramer-Chernoff structure).\n\n**2. Entropy of Bose Quanta (Photons)**\n\nFor a system of bosons (light quanta), a microstate is defined by the set of occupation numbers `{n_i}` for each energy level `ε_i`. Each energy level `ε_i` may consist of `g_i` degenerate sub-levels (modes). The number of ways to distribute `n_i` indistinguishable particles among `g_i` distinguishable sub-levels is:\n`W_i = (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! * (g_i - 1)!)`\n\nThe total multiplicity (number of microstates) for a configuration `{n_i}` is the product over all energy levels:\n`Ω({n_i}) = Π_i W_i`\n\nThe entropy is given by Boltzmann's principle, `S = k_B ln(Ω)`. Using Stirling's approximation (`ln(x!) ≈ x ln(x) - x`) for large `n_i` and `g_i`, the entropy simplifies to:\n`S({n_i}) = k_B Σ_i g_i [ (1 + <n_i>)ln(1 + <n_i>) - <n_i>ln(<n_i>) ]`\nwhere `<n_i> = n_i / g_i` is the average occupation number per mode for the energy level `ε_i`.\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy for Equilibrium**\n\nTo find the equilibrium state, we maximize this entropy `S` subject to the physical constraints on the system.\n*   **Constraint 1: Fixed Mean Energy.** The total energy of the system is `E = Σ_i n_i ε_i`, which is assumed to be constant.\n*   **Constraint 2: Particle Number.** For light quanta (photons), the total number of particles `N = Σ_i n_i` is **not** conserved. This means there is no Lagrange multiplier for the particle number, which is equivalent to setting the chemical potential `μ` to zero.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize `S/k_B` subject to the energy constraint. The Lagrangian is:\n`L = S/k_B - β(Σ_i n_i ε_i - E)`\n`L = Σ_i [ g_i((1 + n_i/g_i)ln(1 + n_i/g_i) - (n_i/g_i)ln(n_i/g_i)) ] - β(Σ_i n_i ε_i - E)`\n\nWe set the partial derivative with respect to each `n_j` to zero: `∂L/∂n_j = 0`.\n`∂(S/k_B)/∂n_j - β ε_j = 0`\nCalculating the derivative of the entropy term:\n`∂(S/k_B)/∂n_j = ln(1 + g_j/n_j)`\nSo, the equilibrium condition is:\n`ln(1 + g_j/n_j) = β ε_j`\n`1 + g_j/n_j = exp(β ε_j)`\n`g_j/n_j = exp(β ε_j) - 1`\n\nThis gives the equilibrium occupation number `<n_j> = n_j/g_j`:\n`<n_j>_{eq} = 1 / (exp(β ε_j) - 1)`\nThis is the celebrated Planck distribution law. The Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified with the inverse temperature, `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n\n**4. Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe equilibrium value of the mean energy `E` is found by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers back into the energy constraint equation:\n`E = Σ_i n_i ε_i = Σ_i g_i <n_i>_{eq} ε_i`\n`E = Σ_i (g_i * ε_i) / (exp(β ε_i) - 1)`\nThis expression gives the total energy of the photon gas as a function of temperature (via `β`) and the system's energy level structure `(ε_i, g_i)`.\n\n**5. Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe equilibrium value of the entropy `S` is found by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers `<n_i>_{eq}` into the entropy formula:\n`S = k_B Σ_i g_i [ (1 + <n_i>_{eq})ln(1 + <n_i>_{eq}) - <n_i>_{eq}ln(<n_i>_{eq}) ]`\nThis expression can be rewritten using the thermodynamic relations derived from the partition function, which connects back to the Cramer-Chernoff formalism.\n\n**6. Consistency with the Partition Function (Cramer-Chernoff Structure)**\n\nThe results can be confirmed using the Grand Canonical Partition Function `Z_G` for photons (`μ=0`).\n`Z_G = Π_i Z_i` where `Z_i` is the partition function for the `g_i` modes at energy `ε_i`.\n`Z_i = [ Σ_{n=0 to ∞} exp(-βnε_i) ]^{g_i} = [1 / (1 - exp(-β ε_i))]^{g_i}`\nThe logarithm of the partition function is:\n`ln(Z_G) = - Σ_i g_i ln(1 - exp(-β ε_i))`\n\nIn the LDT analogy, `ln(Z_G)` is the cumulant generating function. The mean energy `E` and entropy `S` are derived from it:\n*   **Mean Energy:** `E = -∂(ln Z_G)/∂β = - d/dβ [- Σ_i g_i ln(1 - exp(-β ε_i))] = Σ_i g_i ε_i / (exp(β ε_i) - 1)`\nThis matches the result from entropy maximization perfectly.\n*   **Entropy:** The thermodynamic relation for entropy is `S = (E - F)/T`, where the Helmholtz free energy `F = -k_B T ln(Z_G)`. This gives:\n`S = E/T + k_B ln(Z_G) = k_B (βE + ln(Z_G))`\n`S = k_B [ β * Σ_i (g_i ε_i / (exp(β ε_i) - 1)) - Σ_i g_i ln(1 - exp(-β ε_i)) ]`\nThis expression for entropy is equivalent to the one derived from the combinatorial formula when the equilibrium distribution is used. This confirms the deep connection between the statistical (Sanov/Boltzmann) and thermodynamic (Cramer/Gibbs) perspectives.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a system of light quanta (bosons with zero chemical potential), expressed as functions of the inverse temperature `β = 1/(k_B T)` and the system's density of states (`g_i` at energy `ε_i`), are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**\n$E = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\varepsilon_i}{e^{\\beta \\varepsilon_i} - 1}$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n$S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ \\frac{g_i \\beta \\varepsilon_i}{e^{\\beta \\varepsilon_i} - 1} - g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\varepsilon_i}) \\right]$\n\nEquivalently, expressed in terms of the equilibrium mean occupation number per mode, $\\langle n_i \\rangle = (e^{\\beta \\varepsilon_i} - 1)^{-1}$:\n$S = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (1 + \\langle n_i \\rangle) \\ln(1 + \\langle n_i \\rangle) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\ln(\\langle n_i \\rangle) \\right]$\n\n<<<Equilibrium Mean Energy: $E = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\varepsilon_i}{e^{\\beta \\varepsilon_i} - 1}$.
