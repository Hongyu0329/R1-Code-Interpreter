    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific paper in question:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. This is one of his four groundbreaking *Annus Mirabilis* (miracle year) papers. Its official title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n2.  **Examine the content and citations of the paper:** Scientific papers from that era often did not have a formal bibliography or reference list at the end as is common today. Citations were typically embedded directly in the text or in footnotes. Einstein's paper on Brownian motion is famously sparse in its citations, notably omitting any reference to the earlier experimental observations of the phenomenon by botanist Robert Brown or physicist Louis Georges Gouy.\n\n3.  **Locate the specific citation related to lectures:** A crucial part of Einstein's theoretical derivation involves the concept of osmotic pressure, which he applies to suspended particles as if they were giant molecules in a solution. In Section 4 of the paper, titled \"On the Osmotic Pressure from the Standpoint of the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Einstein states that he will use a known result from the molecular theory of heat rather than re-deriving it.\n\n4.  **Identify the person cited:** When referring the reader to a source for the derivation of the osmotic pressure formula, Einstein explicitly writes (in translation): \"...we wish only to apply a result from the molecular theory of heat (theory of osmotic pressure), and refer for its development **e.g. to the Boltzmann lectures on gas theory.**\"\n\n5.  **Confirm the cited work:** The reference is to Ludwig Boltzmann's work. This was published as a highly influential two-volume book titled *Vorlesungen über Gastheorie* (*Lectures on Gas Theory*), with the volumes appearing in 1896 and 1898. The title itself confirms that Einstein was citing published \"lectures.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Form of Citation:** The citation is informal and embedded in the text, typical for the time.\n*   **Specificity of \"Lectures\":** The work cited is literally titled *Lectures on Gas Theory* (*Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*), so the question's use of the word \"lectures\" is precise.\n*   **Use of \"e.g.\":** Einstein's use of \"e.g.\" (for example) implies that Boltzmann's lectures were one possible source for the information, but it is the only one he explicitly names in his paper.\n*   **Single Individual:** Although the question asks \"Whose lectures\" (plural possessive), the paper contains a clear citation to the lectures of a single individual.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the text of Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, we can find a direct, though informal, citation. He refers his readers to the published lectures of a specific physicist for a key part of his argument.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
