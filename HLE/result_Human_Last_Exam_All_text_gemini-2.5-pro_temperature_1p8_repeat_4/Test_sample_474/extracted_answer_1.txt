No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is dependent on the perception of natural predators (like birds), not humans. Avian predators have tetrachromatic vision, allowing them to see ultraviolet (UV) light, which is invisible to the trichromatic vision of humans. Since bee coloration often includes UV patterns, humans cannot perceive the full signal that is being presented to the predator. Therefore, clusters based on human perception may not reflect the functionally relevant mimicry rings that have evolved under selection from predators.
