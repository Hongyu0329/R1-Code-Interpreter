    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the sentence and the word in question.**\nThe sentence is: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\nThe question asks for the part of speech of the first word, which is \"Fat\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the function of the word \"Fat\" in the sentence.**\nIn the sentence, the word \"Fat\" comes directly before the word \"people\". The word \"people\" is a noun (referring to human beings). The word \"Fat\" is describing or modifying the noun \"people\". It answers the question \"What kind of people?\".\n\n**Step 3: Define the parts of speech listed in the answer choices.**\n*   **Verb:** A word that expresses action or a state of being (e.g., run, is, eat).\n*   **Noun:** A word that names a person, place, thing, or idea (e.g., man, city, fat, happiness).\n*   **Adjective:** A word that modifies or describes a noun or pronoun (e.g., *big* house, *they* are happy).\n*   **Adverb:** A word that modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb (e.g., run *quickly*, *very* big).\n*   **Conjunction:** A word used to connect clauses or sentences or to coordinate words in the same clause (e.g., and, but, if).\n\n**Step 4: Determine which part of speech fits the function of \"Fat\".**\nSince \"Fat\" is describing the noun \"people\", its grammatical function is that of an adjective.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates.\" is grammatically incorrect. A grammatically correct version might be \"Fat accumulates when people eat.\" or \"The fat that people eat accumulates.\"\n*   Despite the grammatical error in the overall sentence, the function of the word \"Fat\" in the phrase \"Fat people\" is clear. It acts as a descriptor for the noun \"people\".\n*   The word \"fat\" *can* be a noun (e.g., \"Eating too much can increase your body fat.\"). However, in this specific sentence structure, it is placed before a noun to describe it, which is the role of an adjective.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" functions as an adjective in this sentence. This corresponds to answer choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
