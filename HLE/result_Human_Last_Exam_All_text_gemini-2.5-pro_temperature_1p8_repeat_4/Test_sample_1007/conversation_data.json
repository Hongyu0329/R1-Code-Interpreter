    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe core of the question is to identify the ballet step where the final configuration of the legs (which foot is in front and which is in back) is identical to the initial configuration. For example, if the step begins in the fifth position with the right foot in front, it must also end in the fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in the fifth position, on two feet. Let's assume the right foot is in front (cinquième position, pied droit devant).\n*   **Execution:** \"Entrechat\" means \"interweaving\" or \"braiding.\" It is a vertical jump where the legs beat against each other in the air. \"Six\" refers to six movements (three full beats). From a plié in the fifth position, the dancer jumps. The legs beat: the back leg beats the front, they open slightly, the front leg beats the back, they open, and the back leg beats the front again before landing. This sequence is often described as back-front-back.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the same fifth position they started from. If they started with the right foot front, they land with the right foot front. Even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) always end in the starting position.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish this from odd-numbered entrechats (trois, cinq), which land on one foot. The definition of an even-numbered entrechat is that it starts and ends on two feet, in the same position.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Begins in a closed position, usually the fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Échappé\" means \"to escape.\" The dancer jumps from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second or fourth). \"Battu\" means \"beaten,\" indicating the legs beat together as they close from the open position. \"Changé\" means \"changed.\" This word is the key here. It explicitly states that the feet will change their position. The full step involves jumping from fifth to second, then jumping from second and landing in fifth with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the fifth position, but with the left foot now in front. The position has changed.\n*   **Careful Point:** The term \"changé\" is a direct indicator that the feet do not end in their starting configuration.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Can begin from the fifth position or with one foot extended. Let's assume starting from the fifth position, right foot front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble.\" It is a jump from one foot to two feet. The working leg brushes out to the side, front, or back, and the dancer pushes off the supporting leg. Both legs are then \"assembled\" in the air and land simultaneously in the fifth position. However, there are many types of assemblé. An 'assemblé dessus' (over) will cause the working leg (starting from the back) to land in front. An 'assemblé dessous' (under) will cause the working leg (starting from the front) to land in the back. Both of these common variations change the feet.\n*   **Ending Position:** While a very simple assemblé could theoretically return to the same position, the most common forms (dessus, dessous) used in combinations are designed to change the feet. Therefore, it is not a reliable answer.\n*   **Careful Point:** The term \"Assemblé\" alone is ambiguous, but in practice, it is often a step that changes the feet.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Begins in the fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide.\" \"Derrière\" means \"behind.\" This specifies the direction of travel and closing. The dancer starts in plié and glides the back foot (the left foot in our example) out. They transfer their weight onto it, and the leading foot (the right foot) then slides to close in the fifth position *behind* the other foot.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the fifth position with the left foot in front (because the right foot, which started in front, closed in the back). The feet have changed.\n*   **Careful Point:** Any 'glissade' that travels and closes (devant, derrière) will change the feet. The only exception is a specific, non-traveling 'glissade sur place' or 'glissade sans changer', which is not what is specified here.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Begins in the fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step resembling a pas de chat. It involves a jump where each leg performs a rapid 'rond de jambe en l'air' (circular movement of the leg in the air) in quick succession before landing. The typical execution of a 'gargouillade' involves a change of feet. For example, starting with the right foot front, the dancer jumps, performs a 'rond de jambe' with the right leg, then the left, and lands with the left foot now closing in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** The feet are in the opposite configuration from the start.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is an advanced allegro step where changing the feet is standard for fluidly connecting to the next movement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing all the options, the only step that is defined by returning to the exact starting foot position is the **Entrechat six**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
