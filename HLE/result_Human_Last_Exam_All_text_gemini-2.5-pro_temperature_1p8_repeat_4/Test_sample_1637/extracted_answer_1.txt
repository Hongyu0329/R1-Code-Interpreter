Yes, changing the amide group to a sufficiently long PEG group is a well-established strategy to increase the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic molecules and would very likely solve the precipitation problem. While the amide group itself is polar and contributes positively to solubility, replacing it and the surrounding linker region with a multi-unit PEG chain would significantly increase the molecule's overall hydrophilicity, preventing aggregation and precipitation in the aqueous cell culture medium.
