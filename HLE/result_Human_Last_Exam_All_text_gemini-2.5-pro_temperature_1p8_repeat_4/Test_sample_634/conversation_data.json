    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the problem and define the key concepts.**\n\nWe are asked to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nand\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\nA polynomial matrix G(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)G(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\nG(s) is a **common right divisor** of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a right divisor of both.\nA common right divisor G(s) is a **GCRD** if any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of G(s). The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**2. Choose a method for finding the GCRD.**\n\nA standard algorithm to find the GCRD is to use elementary row operations on a stacked matrix, similar to the Euclidean algorithm for integers or polynomials.\n\n**Step 1: Form the composite matrix M(s).**\nStack P1(s) on top of P2(s) to form a new matrix M(s):\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]\nM(s) =\n[s^2 + s,  -s]       (Row 1)\n[-s^2 - 1,  s^2]      (Row 2)\n[s,        0]         (Row 3)\n[-s - 1,   1]         (Row 4)\n\n**Step 2: Apply elementary row operations to reduce M(s).**\nThe goal is to reduce M(s) to a block matrix of the form [G(s); 0], where G(s) is a 2x2 matrix. This resulting G(s) will be a GCRD of P1 and P2. We'll use the notation `Ri -> Ri + P(s)*Rj` for row operations.\n\n*   The polynomials in rows 3 and 4 have lower degrees, so they are good to use for simplification. Let's first simplify Row 4 by adding Row 3 to it.\n    `R4 -> R4 + R3`:\n    `[-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [s^2 + s,  -s]\n    [-s^2 - 1,  s^2]\n    [s,        0]\n    [-1,       1]      (New R4)\n\n*   Now, use the new constant Row 4 `[-1, 1]` to eliminate the entries in the first column of the other rows.\n    `R1 -> R1 + (s^2 + s) * R4`: `[s^2+s - (s^2+s), -s + s^2+s] = [0, s^2]`\n    `R2 -> R2 - (s^2 + 1) * R4`: `[-s^2-1 + s^2+1, s^2 - (s^2+1)] = [0, -1]`\n    `R3 -> R3 + s * R4`: `[s - s, 0 + s] = [0, s]`\n    The matrix transforms to:\n    [0,   s^2]     (New R1)\n    [0,   -1]      (New R2)\n    [0,    s]      (New R3)\n    [-1,   1]      (Old R4, kept for now)\n\n*   The matrix is now much simpler. Three rows have a zero in the first column. Let's use the new Row 2 `[0, -1]` to eliminate the second column entries in the other rows that have a zero in the first column.\n    `New R1 -> New R1 + s^2 * New R2`: `[0, s^2 + s^2*(-1)] = [0, 0]`\n    `New R3 -> New R3 + s * New R2`: `[0, s + s*(-1)] = [0, 0]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [0,    0]\n    [0,   -1]\n    [0,    0]\n    [-1,   1]\n\n*   Finally, use the row `[0, -1]` to simplify the last row `[-1, 1]`.\n    `R4 -> R4 + R2`: `[-1 + 0, 1 + (-1)] = [-1, 0]`\n    The matrix is now fully reduced to:\n    [0,   0]\n    [0,  -1]\n    [0,   0]\n    [-1,  0]\n\n**Step 3: Extract the GCRD.**\nThe non-zero rows are `[-1, 0]` and `[0, -1]`. We can arrange them to form the GCRD matrix.\nG(s) = [-1,  0;\n        0, -1]\n\nBy convention, the GCRD is often presented in a simpler or canonical form, like an identity matrix if possible. G(s) is unimodular because its determinant is `(-1)*(-1) - 0*0 = 1`, which is a non-zero constant. Any unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD in this case. We can multiply our G(s) by another unimodular matrix, for example, `U = [-1, 0; 0, -1]`, to simplify it.\nNew GCRD = U * G(s) = [-1, 0; 0, -1] * [-1, 0; 0, -1] = [1, 0; 0, 1]\nThis is the identity matrix, I.\n\n**Careful Points & Verification**\n1.  **Row Operations:** Elementary row operations on the stacked matrix M(s) are equivalent to left-multiplying M(s) by a unimodular matrix. This process preserves the GCRD.\n2.  **Unimodularity:** A unimodular GCRD implies that the original matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are **right coprime**.\n3.  **Alternative Check (Rank Method):** P1(s) and P2(s) are right coprime if and only if the rank of the stacked matrix M(s) is 2 (the number of columns) for all complex values of s.\n    *   Let's check the minor formed by rows 3 and 4 of the original M(s): det([s, 0; -s-1, 1]) = s. This is non-zero for all s ≠ 0, so the rank is 2 for all s ≠ 0.\n    *   For s = 0, the matrix is M(0) = [0, 0; -1, 0; 0, 0; -1, 1]. The minor of rows 2 and 4 is det([-1, 0; -1, 1]) = -1 ≠ 0. So, the rank is also 2 at s = 0.\n    *   Since the rank is 2 for all s, the matrices are right coprime, and their GCRD is any unimodular matrix. The standard choice is the identity matrix.\n\nBoth methods confirm the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest common right divisor of the matrices P1 and P2 is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
