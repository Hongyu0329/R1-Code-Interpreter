    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (the square in front of the Pantheon).\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed.\"\n    *   **Timeframe:** It existed \"until 1950.\" This date is a crucial piece of information.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Research:** The first step is to consider what major features of the Piazza della Rotonda or the Pantheon itself have been removed throughout history.\n    *   **The Market:** For centuries, a lively fish and vegetable market operated in the piazza. While a defining feature of the square's life, it was largely cleared away in the mid-19th century (around 1847) and is not typically described as a singular \"architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Tram Lines:** Rome's historic center had tram lines, and old photographs show tracks running through the Piazza della Rotonda, circling the central fountain. This was a major feature of the urban landscape but was dismantled around 1930, not 1950.\n    *   **The Bell Towers of the Pantheon:** The Pantheon, which dominates the square, had a very famous architectural modification that was later removed. In the 17th century, two bell towers were added to the facade of the building.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Most Likely Candidate:** The most prominent and fitting description for a \"unique architectural feature\" that was removed from the Pantheon/Piazza complex is the pair of bell towers.\n    *   **Origin:** They were designed by the master Baroque architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini (though some modern scholars dispute his direct involvement, he was long credited with them) and constructed between 1626 and the 1660s.\n    *   **Uniqueness and Controversy:** These towers were a Baroque addition to a revered ancient Roman temple. Their style clashed dramatically with the Pantheon's classical design. The Roman populace widely disliked them, derisively nicknaming them **\"le orecchie d'asino\"** or **\"the ass's ears.\"** This makes them a very \"unique\" and memorable feature.\n    *   **Removal:** They were a prominent part of the Pantheon's silhouette for over 200 years until a campaign was mounted to restore the building to its perceived original, classical appearance. The towers were subsequently demolished between 1882 and 1883.\n\n4.  **Addressing the Date Discrepancy:**\n    *   The question states the feature was removed in 1950, but historical records confirm the bell towers were removed in the 1880s.\n    *   This is a common issue where historical facts in a question can be slightly inaccurate. While other features like the market or tram lines were also removed, their removal dates (c. 1847 and c. 1930) also do not match 1950.\n    *   Of all the known candidates, the bell towers are by far the most famous and significant *architectural feature* to have been removed. It is highly probable that the question is referring to the bell towers but contains an error regarding the date of removal.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the \"unique architectural feature\" is the pair of bell towers. Despite the date being incorrect in the question's premise, no other removed feature matches the description as well as these towers, which were famous, controversial, and a significant architectural alteration.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe unique architectural feature was a pair of bell towers that had been added to the facade of the Pantheon. They were widely disliked by the Roman people, who nicknamed them \"the ass's ears\" (\"le orecchie d'asino\"). It's important to note that while they are the correct feature, the historical record shows they were removed between 1882-1883, not in 1950 as stated in the question's premise.\n\n<<<The two bell towers, nicknamed \"the ass's ears\", which were added by Bernini."
