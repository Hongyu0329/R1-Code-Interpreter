    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the name \"perfluoronanocar\"**\n\n*   **\"perfluoro-\"**: This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry. It means that all the hydrogen atoms (H) in the original molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms (F). For example, perfluoromethane (CF4) is derived from methane (CH4).\n*   **\"nanocar\"**: This refers to a specific, real molecule designed to resemble a macroscopic car on a molecular scale. It is a well-known example of a molecular machine. To answer the question, we must first identify the chemical structure of the nanocar.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the structure and formula of the base molecule, the nanocar**\n\n*   The most famous and scientifically significant \"nanocar\" was synthesized by the group of Professor James Tour at Rice University in 2005. It is the most likely candidate for this hypothetical question.\n*   This nanocar consists of two main parts: a \"chassis\" and four \"wheels\".\n    *   **Wheels**: The wheels are four C60 fullerene molecules (also known as buckyballs). A C60 fullerene is a sphere made of 60 carbon atoms and contains **zero** hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Chassis**: The chassis is the central frame that connects the wheels. Its chemical structure is derived from a central benzene ring. The specific structure is 2,5-bis(4-ethynylphenyl)-1,4-diethynylbenzene.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of hydrogen atoms in the nanocar chassis**\n\nWe need to carefully count all the hydrogen atoms in the nanocar structure. Since the fullerene wheels have no hydrogens, we only need to count the hydrogens on the chassis. Let's break down the chassis structure:\n\n1.  **Central Benzene Ring**: The central ring is a benzene ring (C6) that is substituted at four positions (1, 2, 4, and 5). A normal benzene ring has 6 hydrogens. Since 4 positions are used for connections, there are 6 - 4 = **2 hydrogen atoms** remaining on this central ring.\n2.  **Side Groups**: There are two identical side groups (at positions 2 and 5) called 4-ethynylphenyl groups. Each of these groups consists of a benzene ring and an ethynyl linker (-C≡C-).\n    *   The benzene ring in this side group is substituted at two positions (para, or 1 and 4). Therefore, each of these rings has 6 - 2 = **4 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   Since there are two of these side groups, the total hydrogen count from them is 2 * 4 = **8 hydrogen atoms**.\n3.  **Other Linkers**: The other two connections (at positions 1 and 4 of the central ring) are simple ethynyl (-C≡C-) linkers that connect directly to the fullerene wheels. These linkers do not contain any hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Total Hydrogen Count**: Adding up the hydrogens from all parts of the chassis: 2 (from the central ring) + 8 (from the two side groups) = **10 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the \"perfluoro-\" rule**\n\n*   The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means we must replace every hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom.\n*   Our analysis shows that a standard nanocar molecule (chassis + wheels) contains a total of 10 hydrogen atoms, all of which are located on its chassis.\n*   Therefore, a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\" would be created by replacing these 10 hydrogen atoms with 10 fluorine atoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA perfluoronanocar would contain the same number of fluorine atoms as the original nanocar has hydrogen atoms. Based on the structure of the most common nanocar, this number is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
