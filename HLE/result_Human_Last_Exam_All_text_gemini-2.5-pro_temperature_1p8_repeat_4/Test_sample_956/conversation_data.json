    "Answering the question involves a step-by-step analysis of the group $G$ and its properties, leading to the determination of its Schur multiplier $A$. Finally, we count the proper subgroups of $A$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the generators and the group $G$\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations $a, b, c$ acting on the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z\\}$ of size 12.\n\n1.  **Analyze generator $a$**:\n    $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$. This is an 11-cycle acting on the subset $S' = S \\setminus \\{z\\}$. The element $z$ is fixed by $a$. The order of $a$ is 11. An 11-cycle is an even permutation since its length is odd, so its sign is $(-1)^{11-1} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze generator $b$**:\n    $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$. This permutation is a product of two disjoint 4-cycles. It also fixes the elements not in these cycles, namely $\\{2, 3, y, z\\}$. So $b$ also acts on $S'$. The order of $b$ is lcm(4, 4) = 4. A 4-cycle is an odd permutation. Since $b$ is a product of two odd permutations, its sign is $(-1) \\times (-1) = 1$. So $b$ is an even permutation.\n\n3.  **Analyze generator $c$**:\n    $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$. This permutation is a product of six disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions). Its order is 2. The sign of $c$ is $(-1)^6 = 1$. So $c$ is also an even permutation.\n\nSince all three generators $a, b, c$ are even permutations, any element of the group $G = \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ will also be an even permutation. Therefore, $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the properties of the group action\n\n1.  **Transitivity**: We check if the action of $G$ on the set $S$ is transitive.\n    The generators $a$ and $b$ fix the element $z$. Let $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle$. Any element of $H$ fixes $z$. The generator $c$ moves $z$: $c(z) = 3$. The orbit of $z$ under $G$ thus contains at least $\\{z, 3\\}$. Now, we consider the action of $H$ on this set. The element $a$ is an 11-cycle on $S' = S \\setminus \\{z\\}$. So the orbit of 3 under $\\langle a \\rangle$ (and thus under $H$) is the entire set $S'$. This means the orbit of $z$ under $G$ is $\\{z\\} \\cup S' = S$. Hence, $G$ acts transitively on the 12 elements of $S$.\n\n2.  **2-Transitivity**: A group is 2-transitive if it is transitive and the stabilizer of any point acts transitively on the remaining points.\n    Let's consider the stabilizer of $z$, denoted $G_z$. An element $g \\in G$ is in $G_z$ if $g(z) = z$. Since $a(z)=z$ and $b(z)=z$, the subgroup $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G_z$.\n    The action of $G_z$ is restricted to the set $S' = S \\setminus \\{z\\}$, which has 11 elements. $H$ contains the permutation $a$, which is an 11-cycle on $S'$. An 11-cycle acts transitively on these 11 points. Therefore, the action of $H$ on $S'$ is transitive. Since $H \\le G_z$, the action of $G_z$ on $S'$ must also be transitive.\n    This proves that $G$ is a 2-transitive group on 12 elements.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the group $G$ up to possibility\n\nWe have established that $G$ is a 2-transitive subgroup of $A_{12}$ on 12 elements. The classification of finite 2-transitive groups tells us that such a group must be one of the following:\n*   The alternating group $A_{12}$.\n*   The Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n*   The projective special linear group $PSL(2, 11)$, in its exceptional action on 12 points.\n\nLet's check if $G$ can be $PSL(2, 11)$. The orders of elements in $PSL(2, 11)$ are known to be divisors of $11$, $11-1=10$, and $(11+1)/2=6$. The maximum element order in $PSL(2, 11)$ is 11. In particular, it is a known fact that $PSL(2, p)$ has no elements of order 4 if $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$, and $11 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 8$.\nOur group $G$ has a generator $b$ of order 4. Therefore, $G$ cannot be isomorphic to $PSL(2, 11)$.\n\nThis leaves two possibilities for $G$:\n1.  $G \\cong M_{12}$ (the Mathieu group on 12 points)\n2.  $G \\cong A_{12}$ (the alternating group on 12 points)\n\nBoth $M_{12}$ and $A_{12}$ are simple groups. The generators given are in fact known standard generators for $M_{12}$, but we do not need to prove this definitively.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Schur Multiplier of $G$\n\nThe question asks for the Schur multiplier of $G$, which we denote by $A$. The Schur multiplier (or multiplicator) $M(G)$ is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. For finite simple groups, these are well-documented.\n\n*   **Case 1: $G \\cong M_{12}$**. The Schur multiplier of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is the cyclic group of order 2. So, $M(M_{12}) \\cong C_2$.\n*   **Case 2: $G \\cong A_{12}$**. The Schur multiplier of the alternating group $A_n$ for $n \\ge 5$ (with the exceptions of $n=6, 7$) is the cyclic group of order 2. Thus, $M(A_{12}) \\cong C_2$.\n\nIn both possible cases for $G$, the Schur multiplier is the same abelian group: $A \\cong C_2$.\n\n### Step 5: Count the proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism\n\nThe Schur multiplier is $A \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2. Let $A = \\{e, g\\}$, where $e$ is the identity and $g^2 = e$.\nThe subgroups of $A$ are:\n1.  The trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n2.  The group $A$ itself.\n\nA proper subgroup is any subgroup of $A$ that is not equal to $A$. The only proper subgroup of $A$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\nThe question asks for the number of proper subgroups *up to isomorphism*. The trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ is isomorphic to the trivial group $C_1$. All trivial subgroups are isomorphic to each other.\nThus, there is only one isomorphism class for the proper subgroups of $A$.\nThe number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism is 1."
