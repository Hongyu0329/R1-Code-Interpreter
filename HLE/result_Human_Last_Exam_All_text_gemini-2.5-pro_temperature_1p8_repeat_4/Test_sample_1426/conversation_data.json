    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the lowest note among the last three notes played by the first violin section in Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Correct Musical Score**\nTo answer this, we need to consult the musical score for Dvořák's Symphony No. 2. We must look at the very end of the piece, specifically the last movement (IV. Finale: Allegro con fuoco).\n\n**Step 3: Isolate the First Violin Part**\nWithin the full orchestral score, we need to find the staff labeled \"Violino I\" or \"First Violin\". This part is typically located at the top of the string section staves.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Final Notes**\nLooking at the final measure of the symphony, we observe that the orchestra concludes on a loud, sustained chord. The question's phrasing \"ends on three notes\" refers to the notes that the first violin section plays simultaneously to form this final chord. This is a common orchestral technique known as a \"triple stop,\" where a violinist plays across three strings at once.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Specific Notes**\nThe symphony is in B-flat major, and it ends on a strong B-flat major chord. For the first violins (Violino I), the final measure contains a single whole note with a fermata over it, consisting of three notes stacked vertically. These three notes are:\n*   **B-flat (B♭)** - The lowest note in the chord.\n*   **D** - The middle note.\n*   **F** - The highest note.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Lowest Note**\nBy comparing the three notes (B♭, D, F) that constitute the final chord played by the first violins, we can clearly identify the lowest one. In the standard diatonic scale, B-flat is lower in pitch than both D and F.\n\nTherefore, the lowest of the three final notes is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
