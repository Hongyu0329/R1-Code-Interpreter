    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the provided information:**\n    *   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg)\n    *   **Year:** 1997\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n    *   **Action:** Moves to the United States.\n    *   **Information needed:** The name of the city.\n\n3.  **Analyze the character's role in the plot:** Tommaso is the best friend of the protagonist, Piero Mansani. He comes from a wealthy family but is restless and dissatisfied with his life in Livorno, Italy. His character arc involves trying different paths (university, music) before ultimately deciding to leave the country to find himself.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the relevant scene:** There is a key scene in the movie where Tommaso informs Piero of his decision to leave. In this conversation, he expresses his disillusionment with his life and announces his plan to move to the United States for a fresh start.\n\n5.  **Extract the specific detail:** During his conversation with Piero, Tommaso explicitly states his destination. He says he is moving to **New York City**, which he sees as a place of anonymity and opportunity, a stark contrast to the provincial life he wants to escape. The film shows his departure, with New York City being his stated and intended destination.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Protagonist vs. Secondary Character:** It's important to remember that the question is about Tommaso, not the film's protagonist, Piero.\n*   **Stated vs. Shown Destination:** The film does not follow Tommaso to the US. We learn of his destination through his own words. The question asks where he \"moves to\" within the context of the film's narrative, and his stated destination is the definitive answer provided by the movie.\n*   **Confirmation:** Verifying this information requires knowledge of the film's plot details or a quick check of a detailed synopsis or script summary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the dialogue in the film *Ovosodo*, the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, explicitly states that he is moving to New York City.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
