    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group ($SD_{512}$):**\n    The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ is denoted $SD_{2^n}$. For a size of 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n=9$. The group $SD_{512}$ is a 2-group of order 512.\n    Its standard presentation is given by:\n    $G = SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{9-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{9-2}-1} \\rangle$\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n    The elements of $G$ are of two forms:\n    1.  Powers of $r$: $\\{r^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256.\n    2.  Elements of the form $sr^i$: $\\{sr^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$. There are 256 such elements, forming a coset of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:**\n    The term \"power subgroup\" can be ambiguous. A common interpretation in the context of p-group theory is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some positive integer $k$. We will proceed with this definition as it is a specific technical term used in group theory literature. The question \"how many\" implies counting the number of distinct subgroups obtained by varying $k$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the k-th powers of elements in G\n\nTo find the subgroup $G^k$, we need to find the k-th powers of all elements in $G$.\nLet $g \\in G$.\n1.  If $g = r^i$, then $g^k = (r^i)^k = r^{ik}$.\n2.  If $g = sr^j$, we need to compute $(sr^j)^k$. We first compute the square of this element using the relation $srs = r^{127}$, which implies $s r s^{-1} = r^{127}$.\n    $(sr^j)^2 = (sr^j)(sr^j) = s(r^j s) r^j$.\n    We find the expression for $r^j s$ by conjugation: $s r^j s^{-1} = (s r s^{-1})^j = (r^{127})^j = r^{127j}$.\n    Since $s=s^{-1}$, we have $s r^j s = r^{127j}$.\n    So, $(sr^j)^2 = s(r^j s)r^j = (s r^j s) r^j = r^{127j}r^j = r^{128j}$.\n    This is a crucial simplification. For $G=SD_{2^n}$, the general formula is $(sr^j)^2 = r^{j \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$. Here $n=9$, so $(sr^j)^2 = r^{j \\cdot 2^7} = r^{128j}$.\n\nNow we can compute $(sr^j)^k$:\n*   If $k$ is even, let $k=2m$.\n    $(sr^j)^k = (sr^j)^{2m} = ((sr^j)^2)^m = (r^{128j})^m = r^{128jm}$.\n*   If $k$ is odd, let $k=2m+1$.\n    $(sr^j)^k = (sr^j)^{2m+1} = ((sr^j)^2)^m (sr^j) = (r^{128j})^m (sr^j) = r^{128jm} sr^j$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the power subgroups G^k for odd k\n\nLet $k$ be any odd integer. The subgroup $G^k$ is generated by all elements $g^k$ for $g \\in G$.\n*   The set of generators includes $\\{ (r^i)^k = r^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\text{gcd}(k, 256) = 1$. This means that as $i$ ranges from 0 to 255, $ik \\pmod{256}$ also covers all residues from 0 to 255. Therefore, the subgroup generated by these elements is $\\langle r \\rangle$ itself.\n*   The set of generators also includes $(s)^k$. Since $s^2=1$ and $k$ is odd, $s^k=s$.\nSo, $G^k$ contains the entire subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ and the element $s$. Since $G$ is generated by $r$ and $s$, any subgroup containing both must be $G$ itself.\nTherefore, for any odd integer $k$, $G^k = G$. This gives us one unique power subgroup.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the power subgroups G^k for even k\n\nLet $k$ be any even integer. Let $k=2m$.\nThe generators for $G^k$ are:\n*   $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$. These elements generate the subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle$.\n*   $(sr^j)^k = r^{128jm}$. The subgroup generated by these elements is $\\langle r^{128m} \\rangle$.\nSo, $G^k$ is the subgroup generated by the union of $\\langle r^k \\rangle$ and $\\langle r^{128m} \\rangle$:\n$G^k = \\langle \\langle r^k \\rangle, \\langle r^{128m} \\rangle \\rangle$.\nSince $k=2m$, we have $128m = 64 \\cdot (2m) = 64k$. So the second set of generators is $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$.\nAs $r^{64k} = (r^k)^{64}$, the subgroup $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\\langle r^k \\rangle$.\nThus, for any even $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 5: Count the distinct power subgroups\n\nWe now count the number of unique subgroups we have found.\n1.  From odd values of $k$: We found only one subgroup, which is $G$ itself.\n2.  From even values of $k$: We found subgroups of the form $\\langle r^k \\rangle$. A subgroup $\\langle r^a \\rangle$ of a cyclic group $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256 is uniquely determined by $\\text{gcd}(a, 256)$.\n    So, for an even $k$, $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\text{gcd}(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    Since $k$ is even and 256 is a power of 2 ($2^8$), $\\text{gcd}(k, 256)$ must be a power of 2, specifically one of $\\{2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8\\}$.\n    Let's check if we can obtain all of these.\n    *   For $k=2$, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   For $k=4$, $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   ...\n    *   For $k=128$, $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$.\n    *   For $k=256$, $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\langle e \\rangle$, the trivial subgroup.\n    These correspond to the 8 distinct subgroups $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ for $j=1, 2, ..., 8$. These are all distinct from each other as they have different orders ($128, 64, ..., 2, 1$). They are also all distinct from $G$, since they are proper cyclic subgroups of $G$.\n\nIn total, the set of all distinct power subgroups is:\n$\\{ G, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{e\\} \\}$\nCounting these subgroups, we have 1 subgroup from the odd $k$ case and 8 distinct subgroups from the even $k$ cases.\nTotal number of power subgroups = $1 + 8 = 9$."
