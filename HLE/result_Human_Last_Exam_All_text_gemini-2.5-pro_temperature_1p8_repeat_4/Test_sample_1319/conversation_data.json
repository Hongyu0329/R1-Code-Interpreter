    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question's Parameters**\nThe question asks for four specific things:\n1.  A mountain that is **historical** (i.e., a real, identifiable geographical feature).\n2.  A mountain **mentioned** in Homer's *Iliad*.\n3.  The **tallest** among the candidates.\n4.  It must **not be Mount Olympus**.\n\n**Step 2: List the Historical Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nWe need to comb through the text of the *Iliad* to find all mentions of specific, real-world mountains. Key candidates include:\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods. It is the highest mountain in Greece. As per the question, we must exclude this from our final answer.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This is a crucial mountain in the epic. Zeus sits on its peak (specifically Gargarus) to watch the Trojan War unfold below. This is the historical Mount Ida (modern name Kaz Dağı) in Turkey.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, Poseidon climbs the highest peak of the island of Samothrace (modern name Mount Fengari or Saos) to get a clear view of the battle at Troy.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Lemnos, her journey takes her over \"the snowy mountains of the horsemen of Thrace\" and then \"from Athos she stepped upon the surging sea.\" This is the historical Mount Athos in northern Greece.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly is mentioned as the source of the great ash-wood spear that was given to Achilles' father, Peleus, and which Achilles uses in the war.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain is mentioned once in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" in Book 2. Homer describes the warriors from Lydia as coming from a land \"whose birthplace was under the snowy Tmolos.\" This is the historical Mount Tmolus (modern name Bozdağ) in the ancient region of Lydia in Turkey.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Elevations of the Candidate Mountains**\nNow we must compare the heights of these historical mountains to find the tallest one after Olympus. The elevations are approximately:\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft) — *Excluded by the question*.\n2.  **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ, Turkey):** 2,157 meters (7,077 ft).\n3.  **Mount Athos (Greece):** 2,033 meters (6,670 ft).\n4.  **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft).\n5.  **Mount Pelion (Greece):** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft).\n6.  **Mount Samothrace (Fengari, Greece):** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Final Answer**\nBy comparing the elevations, we can see that Mount Tmolus, at 2,157 meters, is the tallest mountain on the list after the excluded Mount Olympus.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Significance vs. Height:** While Mount Ida is narratively far more important in the *Iliad* than Mount Tmolus, the question asks for the \"tallest,\" which is a factual, objective measure, not a measure of literary importance.\n*   **Historical Accuracy:** All the mountains listed are real, historical locations, fulfilling that part of the query.\n*   **Specific Mention:** Each of these mountains is explicitly named or clearly referenced within the text of the *Iliad*.\n\nTherefore, based on a direct comparison of their modern-day elevations, the correct answer is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
