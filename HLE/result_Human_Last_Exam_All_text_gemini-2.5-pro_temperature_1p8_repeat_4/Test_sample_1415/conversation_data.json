    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral Form**\nThe integral to be evaluated is:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThis integral is in the form ∫ (g'(x)/g(x)) dx, where g(x) = F₃(x). The antiderivative of this form is well-known:\n∫ (g'(x)/g(x)) dx = ln|g(x)| + C\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\nTo evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate F₃(0)**\nWe need to calculate the value of F₃(x) at x = 0 by following the chain of function definitions:\n1.  `F₀(x) = x`\n    `F₀(0) = 0`\n2.  `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))`\n    `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n3.  `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))`\n    `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1`\n4.  `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))`\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate F₃(1)**\nNext, we calculate the value of F₃(x) at x = 1:\n1.  `F₀(x) = x`\n    `F₀(1) = 1`\n2.  `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))`\n    `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)` (Note: The argument of sin is in radians)\n3.  `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))`\n    `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n4.  `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))`\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the value of the integral V**\nNow substitute the values of F₃(0) and F₃(1) back into the expression for V.\nFirst, let's check the signs of the arguments for the absolute value:\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2)`. Since 2 > 1, ln(2) is positive.\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`. Since `e^(anything)` is positive, `1 + e^(sin(1))` is greater than 1, so its logarithm `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` is also positive.\nTherefore, we can remove the absolute value signs:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can simplify V:\nV = ln [ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / (ln(2)) ]\n\n**Step 6: Numerically evaluate V and find the final answer**\nWe need to compute the numerical value of V and then multiply by 10000.\n1.  `sin(1)` (where 1 is in radians) ≈ 0.84147\n2.  `e^(sin(1))` ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.31978\n3.  `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 1 + 2.31978 = 3.31978\n4.  `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` ≈ ln(3.31978) ≈ 1.2000\n5.  `ln(2)` ≈ 0.69315\n6.  `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2)` ≈ 1.2000 / 0.69315 ≈ 1.73124\n7.  `V = ln(1.73124)` ≈ 0.54886\n\nFinally, we calculate the required value:\n`10000 * V` ≈ 10000 * 0.54886 = 5488.6\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to this value. The closest integer to 5488.6 is 5489.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognizing the integral ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx is the key to avoiding explicit differentiation of the complicated F₃(x).\n*   Remembering that the default unit for trigonometric functions in calculus is radians.\n*   Keeping track of the nested functions and evaluating them in the correct order for x=0 and x=1.\n*   Careful application of logarithm rules: `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`.\n*   Correctly performing the final numerical calculation and rounding to the nearest integer.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
