    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Phenotype:** An observable trait of an individual, such as height, weight, or susceptibility to a disease.\n*   **SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism):** The most common type of genetic variation among people. Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide.\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical, population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (within a specific population) that can be explained by the combined additive effects of *all* common SNPs across the genome. It is the *theoretical maximum* amount of variance that could be explained if we knew the *true* effect of every single SNP perfectly. This value is typically estimated using methods like LD Score Regression or GCTA-GREML, which use genome-wide data from a large group of individuals.\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical, individual-level score. It's a tool used to predict an individual's phenotype based on their personal genetic data. It is calculated by summing up the effects of many SNPs, where the \"effect\" of each SNP (its weight in the score) is *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is a measure of how well a specific PGS can predict the actual phenotype in a *new* set of individuals (a target sample that was not used to create the PGS). It is typically measured by R², which is the proportion of phenotypic variance in the target sample that is explained by the PGS.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Relationship Between SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability**\n\nThe key to understanding the relationship lies in the distinction between a **theoretical maximum** and a **practical implementation**.\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability as the Ceiling:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the ceiling or the upper bound on predictive power. It answers the question: \"If we had perfect knowledge of the true effect of every SNP, what is the maximum proportion of the trait's variance we could possibly explain with a linear model of these SNPs?\"\n\n2.  **PGS as the Attempt to Reach the Ceiling:** A polygenic score is our practical attempt to build that linear model. However, we do not have perfect knowledge. The weights (effect sizes) used in the PGS are not the true, unknown effect sizes. Instead, they are *estimates* derived from a GWAS, which has a finite sample size.\n\n**Step 3: List the Careful Points (Reasons for the Discrepancy)**\n\nThe predictive ability of a PGS (its R²) is lower than the SNP heritability for several unavoidable reasons:\n\n1.  **Estimation Error:** Because a GWAS is conducted on a finite number of people, the estimated effect size for each SNP will have some statistical error. It will not be exactly the true effect size. When these imperfect estimates are combined to form a PGS, their errors accumulate, reducing the overall predictive accuracy. The smaller the GWAS sample, the larger the estimation error and the lower the PGS's predictive power.\n2.  **Imperfect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Modeling:** The effect attributed to one SNP in a GWAS often captures the effects of other nearby SNPs that are inherited along with it (a phenomenon called Linkage Disequilibrium or LD). PGS methods must account for this, but the models are not perfect. Furthermore, if the LD patterns differ between the GWAS discovery population and the target population (e.g., populations of different ancestry), the predictive power of the PGS will decrease.\n3.  **\"Winner's Curse\":** In many methods for building a PGS, only SNPs that pass a certain statistical significance threshold are included. These SNPs are more likely to be ones whose effects were overestimated by chance in the GWAS. When these inflated effects are applied to a new sample, the PGS tends to perform worse than expected, an effect known as the winner's curse.\n4.  **Assumptions of the Genetic Model:** Both SNP heritability estimation and PGS construction typically assume a simple additive model of genetic effects. Reality may be more complex (e.g., involving gene-gene or gene-environment interactions), which can limit the accuracy of both, but particularly the PGS which is a direct application of that simple model.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nSNP heritability (h²_SNP) sets the theoretical upper limit on the variance that can be explained by a linear combination of SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical predictor built using *estimated* and therefore imperfect information from a finite GWAS sample. Due to these inherent imperfections (estimation error, LD mismatches, etc.), the variance explained by any realizable PGS will necessarily be lower than the theoretical maximum defined by the SNP heritability. The R² of a PGS can get closer to the h²_SNP as the size of the discovery GWAS increases towards infinity, but it cannot exceed it.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n<<<True>>>"
