    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack you should open from the button.\n\n**1. Understand the Scenario:**\n*   **Game:** 100BB No-Limit Hold'em cash game. This is the standard stack depth for which most strategies are based.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most powerful position pre-flop. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street, which dramatically increases the profitability of playing hands.\n*   **Action:** Opening with a raise to 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard opening size.\n*   **Environment:** Rake-Free. This is a critical piece of information. Rake is the fee taken by the house from each pot. In a normal game, the rake makes it unprofitable to fight for very small pots, thus tightening opening ranges. In a rake-free game, there is no such penalty. Winning the blinds pre-flop (1.5BB) is more profitable, which incentivizes opening a much wider range of hands.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hand Category: Suited Jacks (JXs)**\n*   Suited hands have significant value because they can make flushes, which are very strong hands.\n*   The Jack provides good high-card value.\n*   We need to rank the suited Jacks from best to worst. The primary factors are high-card strength (of the kicker) and connectivity (ability to make straights).\n*   The ranking is as follows, from best to worst:\n    1.  **JTs** (Suited connector)\n    2.  **J9s** (Suited one-gapper)\n    3.  **J8s** (Suited two-gapper)\n    4.  **J7s** (Suited three-gapper)\n    5.  **J6s**\n    6.  **J5s**\n    7.  **J4s**\n    8.  **J3s**\n    9.  **J2s** (Weakest kicker, largest gap)\n\n**3. Determine the Button's Opening Range:**\n*   Given the powerful position (Button) and the highly favorable rake-free environment, the optimal strategy is to open an extremely wide range of hands. The goal is to steal the blinds often and play profitably in position when called.\n*   A standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) opening range from the button in a 100BB raked game is already very wide, often around 45-50% of hands. This almost always includes all suited Jacks.\n*   In a **rake-free** game, this range expands even further. The EV (Expected Value) of opening any borderline hand increases because stealing the blinds is more valuable.\n*   Modern poker solvers confirm that in a 100BB, rake-free scenario, you should be opening all suited Aces, suited Kings, suited Queens, and suited Jacks from the button. The profitability of being in position with a hand that can flop a strong flush draw, a pair, or backdoor draws is too high to pass up.\n\n**4. Identify the \"Worst\" Hand to Open:**\n*   The question asks for the \"worst suited jack you *should* open.\" This implies we need to find the hand at the bottom of the list that is still considered a standard, profitable open.\n*   Since the GTO-approved range includes all suited Jacks (from JTs down to J2s), we look for the hand with the lowest intrinsic value within that group.\n*   Following the ranking from step 2, the weakest suited Jack is **J2s**. It has the worst kicker and zero connectivity for straights.\n*   Despite being the \"worst\" of its kind, the combination of its suit, the high-card value of the Jack, and the supreme positional advantage of the button makes J2s a profitable open-raise in this rake-free setting. Hands that would be folded would be weaker hands still, like T5s or 94s (though even these are often opens on the button in rake-free games).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on a modern, GTO approach for the specified game conditions, all suited Jack combinations are profitable to open from the button. The \"worst\" of these profitable hands is the one ranked lowest in value, which is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
