    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Parameters**\n\nThe question asks for a specific ship with several qualifying conditions:\n1.  **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n2.  **Cause of Sinking:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat. Sinking by mines, aircraft, surface ships, or accidents does not count.\n3.  **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred during World War II but *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This period runs from France's declaration of war on September 3, 1939, to June 22, 1940.\n4.  **Criterion for Size:** The ship must be the \"largest by displacement.\" This requires us to compare the sizes of potential candidates.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Term \"Largest by Displacement\"**\n\nThis is a careful point. Warships are officially measured in \"displacement tons,\" which is the actual weight of the ship. Merchant ships, however, are typically measured in \"Gross Register Tonnage\" (GRT), which is a measure of internal volume, not weight. For the purpose of answering this question, we must find the largest ship by its commonly cited tonnage, as the GRT of a large passenger liner is a valid proxy for its massive size and would correspond to a very large displacement weight, far exceeding any French warship lost in this specific scenario. We will consider both naval and merchant ships.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate French Naval Losses (Warships)**\n\nDuring the specified timeframe (Sept 1939 - June 1940), the French Navy (Marine Nationale) was active, primarily in escorting convoys. We need to check for major warship losses to U-boats.\n*   A search of French naval losses reveals that no large warships like battleships, aircraft carriers, or cruisers were sunk by U-boats in this period.\n*   The only confirmed French warship sunk by a U-boat in this timeframe was the submarine **Doris (Q135)**, sunk on May 9, 1940, by U-9. Its surfaced displacement was only 609 tons, making it a very small vessel.\n*   Other large French destroyers lost during the Battle of France (e.g., *Jaguar*, *Siroco*) were sunk by German E-boats or aircraft, not U-boats.\n\nConclusion for this step: The largest ship will not be a warship, as no large ones were sunk by U-boats. We must therefore investigate the merchant marine.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate French Merchant Marine Losses**\n\nWe will search for large French merchant ships sunk by U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940. The most significant losses were large passenger liners repurposed for wartime use.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: S.S. *Bretagne***\n    *   Tonnage: 10,170 GRT\n    *   Sunk: October 14, 1939, by U-45.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: S.S. *Champollion***\n    *   Tonnage: 12,263 GRT\n    *   Sunk: October 2, 1939, by U-45.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: S.S. *Sheherazade***\n    *   Tonnage: **13,467 GRT**\n    *   Sunk: September 21, 1939, by U-27.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Candidates and Determine the Final Answer**\n\nBy comparing the tonnage of the largest French merchant ships sunk by U-boats in the specified period, a clear winner emerges.\n\n*   *Sheherazade*: 13,467 GRT\n*   *Champollion*: 12,263 GRT\n*   *Bretagne*: 10,170 GRT\n\nThe largest of these is the **S.S. *Sheherazade***. As established in Step 3, no French warship sunk by a U-boat came close to this size. Therefore, the *Sheherazade*, a passenger liner, was the largest French ship of any kind to meet all the criteria of the question. It was sunk by the U-boat U-27 while sailing unescorted in the Atlantic, west of Ireland.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Strict Timeframe:** The Armistice of 22 June 1940 is a hard cutoff. Ships sunk after this date (e.g., at Mers-el-KÃ©bir) are not eligible.\n2.  **Specific Cause:** The agent of sinking must be a U-boat. This excludes many other notable French naval losses from the Battle of France.\n3.  **Ship Type:** The term \"ship\" includes both naval (warships) and civilian (merchant) vessels. Failure to check merchant losses would lead to an incorrect answer.\n4.  **Measure of Size:** The potential ambiguity between displacement tons (weight) and GRT (volume) must be noted. However, given the options, the ship with the highest GRT is indisputably the largest vessel sunk that fits the criteria.\n\nThe final answer is the passenger liner *Sheherazade*.\n\n<<<The S.S. Sheherazade>>>"
