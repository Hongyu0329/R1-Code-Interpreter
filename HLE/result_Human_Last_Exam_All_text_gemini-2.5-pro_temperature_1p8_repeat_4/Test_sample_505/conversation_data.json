    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Surface Code Encoding**\n\n*   A logical qubit is a quantum state encoded into many physical qubits to protect it from errors.\n*   The surface code is a type of quantum error-correcting code arranged on a 2D lattice of physical qubits.\n*   Logical qubits in a surface code are defined by its topologyâ€”specifically, by boundaries and holes (also called defects or punctures).\n*   For a single, connected patch of planar surface code, the number of logical qubits it can encode (`k`) is directly related to the number of holes (`h`) created within it.\n\n**Step 2: The Key Relationship Between Holes and Logical Qubits**\n\n*   The fundamental rule for encoding in a planar surface code is:\n    `k = h`\n    where `k` is the number of logical qubits and `h` is the number of holes.\n*   **Careful Point:** This simple formula holds for a single patch. Each hole effectively creates an additional \"boundary\" within the code. A logical operator can then be represented by a string connecting any two distinct boundaries (e.g., hole-to-hole or hole-to-edge). With `h` holes, you get `h` independent logical qubits.\n    *   A patch with 0 holes encodes 0 logical qubits.\n    *   A patch with 1 hole encodes 1 logical qubit.\n    *   A patch with 2 holes encodes 2 logical qubits.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Problem's Components**\n\n*   We have **two independent patches** of surface code. Let's call them Patch 1 and Patch 2.\n*   We have a **total of two holes** to distribute among these two patches.\n*   Our goal is to find the **maximum** total number of logical qubits.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Calculation**\n\n*   Let `h1` be the number of holes in Patch 1 and `h2` be the number of holes in Patch 2.\n*   Let `k1` be the number of logical qubits in Patch 1 and `k2` be the number of logical qubits in Patch 2.\n*   From Step 2, we know `k1 = h1` and `k2 = h2`.\n*   Since the patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits (`k_total`) is the sum of the qubits from each patch:\n    `k_total = k1 + k2`\n*   Substituting the relationship between holes and qubits, we get:\n    `k_total = h1 + h2`\n*   The main constraint is that the total number of holes is two:\n    `h1 + h2 = 2`\n*   **Careful Point:** The number of holes in each patch (`h1`, `h2`) must be a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Possible Distributions**\n\nWe need to find the distribution of the two holes across the two patches that maximizes `k_total = h1 + h2`. Since we already know `h1 + h2 = 2`, the total number of logical qubits will always be 2, regardless of how we distribute the holes. Let's verify this by checking the possible integer distributions.\n\n*   **Possibility A: Distribute the holes as (2, 0)**\n    *   Patch 1 gets 2 holes (`h1 = 2`).\n    *   Patch 2 gets 0 holes (`h2 = 0`).\n    *   Logical qubits in Patch 1: `k1 = h1 = 2`.\n    *   Logical qubits in Patch 2: `k2 = h2 = 0`.\n    *   Total logical qubits: `k_total = 2 + 0 = 2`.\n\n*   **Possibility B: Distribute the holes as (1, 1)**\n    *   Patch 1 gets 1 hole (`h1 = 1`).\n    *   Patch 2 gets 1 hole (`h2 = 1`).\n    *   Logical qubits in Patch 1: `k1 = h1 = 1`.\n    *   Logical qubits in Patch 2: `k2 = h2 = 1`.\n    *   Total logical qubits: `k_total = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Possibility C: Distribute the holes as (0, 2)**\n    *   This is symmetric to Possibility A and yields the same result.\n    *   Total logical qubits: `k_total = 0 + 2 = 2`.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nIn all possible valid configurations, the total number of encoded logical qubits is 2. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits is 2. The key insight is that the total number of logical qubits is simply the total number of holes, irrespective of how those holes are distributed among the independent patches.\n\n<<<2>>>"
