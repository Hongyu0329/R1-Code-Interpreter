    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the hook-length formula.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ such that the dimension of the corresponding irrep, $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify families of partitions with small dimensions.**\n    The dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small when the Young diagram for the partition $\\lambda$ is \"long and thin\" or \"wide and flat\". These correspond to partitions where one part is very large, or where there are many small parts (which corresponds to the conjugate partition having a very large first part).\n    We can systematize the search by considering partitions based on their \"defect\", $d = n - \\lambda_1$. A small defect means the first row is very long.\n    For any partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ has the same dimension, $d_{\\lambda'} = d_\\lambda$. If $\\lambda \\ne \\lambda'$, this pair gives two irreps with the same dimension. If $\\lambda = \\lambda'$ (a self-conjugate partition), it corresponds to a single irrep.\n    A partition with a large first part ($\\lambda_1$ close to $n$) cannot be self-conjugate for $n \\ge 2$. Specifically, for a partition to be self-conjugate, its diagram must be symmetric about the main diagonal, which implies $\\lambda_1$ cannot be much larger than the number of parts. All partitions we will find with small dimension have $\\lambda_1 > n/2 = 12.5$, and thus cannot be self-conjugate. Their conjugates will have a large number of parts and a small first part.\n    Our strategy will be to count all partitions $\\lambda$ with a large first part ($\\lambda_1 \\ge 13$) and dimension less than 500,000. Let this set be $L$. Their conjugates $\\lambda'$ will have a small first part ($\\lambda'_1 \\le 12$). The set of these conjugates is $L'$. The sets $L$ and $L'$ are disjoint. The total count will be $2 \\times |L|$.\n\n2.  **Systematic search by defect $d=25-\\lambda_1$.**\n    For each defect $d$, we find partitions of $d$, say $\\pi$, and form partitions of 25 as $\\lambda=(25-d, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\dots)$. We then calculate the dimension $d_\\lambda$.\n\n    *   **Defect d=0 ($\\lambda_1=25$):**\n        *   $\\lambda=(25)$: $d_{(25)}=1$. (1 irrep found in $L$).\n    *   **Defect d=1 ($\\lambda_1=24$):**\n        *   $\\lambda=(24,1)$: $d_{(24,1)} = \\binom{24}{1} = 24$. (1 irrep found in $L$).\n    *   **Defect d=2 ($\\lambda_1=23$):** Partitions of 2 are $\\{2, 1^2\\}$.\n        *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $d=275$.\n        *   $\\lambda=(23,1^2)$: $d=276$.\n        (2 irreps found in $L$).\n    *   **Defect d=3 ($\\lambda_1=22$):** Partitions of 3 are $\\{3, 2+1, 1^3\\}$.\n        *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $d=2,000$.\n        *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $d=4,025$.\n        *   $\\lambda=(22,1^3)$: $d=2,024$.\n        (3 irreps found in $L$).\n    *   **Defect d=4 ($\\lambda_1=21$):** Partitions of 4 are 5.

The dimensions grow rapidly. We check the partitions corresponding to the \"outermost\" partitions of 7.\n        *   $\\lambda=(18,7)$: $d=303,600$ (< 500k)\n        *   $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$: $d=346,104$ (< 500k)\n        *   The next ones to check are (18,6,1) and (18,2,1^5).\n        *   $d_{(18,6,1)} = 1,354,104$ (> 500k).\n        *   All other partitions of defect 7 yield dimensions greater than 500,000.\n        (2 irreps found in $L$).\n    *   **Defect d=8 ($\\lambda_1=17$):**\n        *   The minimal dimension for this defect comes from $\\lambda=(17,8)$: $d=600,875$ (> 500k).\n        *   No irreps with defect 8 or higher will have dimension less than 500,000.\n\n3.  **Final Count.**\n    The number of partitions in our set $L$ (those with $\\lambda_1 > 12.5$) is the sum of the counts for each defect:\n    $|L| = 1 (d=0) + 1 (d=1) + 2 (d=2) + 3 (d=3) + 5 (d=4) + 7 (d=5) + 5 (d=6) + 2 (d=7) = 26$.\n    Each of these 26 partitions has a distinct conjugate partition which also has a dimension less than 500,000. This gives $26 \\times 2 = 52$ partitions in total.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Partitions with defect 0: 1 pair = 2 irreps.\n*   Partitions with defect 1: 1 pair = 2 irreps.\n*   Partitions with defect 2: 2 pairs = 4 irreps.\n*   Partitions with defect 3: 3 pairs = 6 irreps.\n*   Partitions with defect 4: 5 pairs = 10 irreps.\n*   Partitions with defect 5: 7 pairs = 14 irreps.\n*   Partitions with defect 6: 5 pairs = 10 irreps.\n*   Partitions with defect 7: 2 pairs = 4 irreps.\n\nTotal number of irreps is $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 10 + 4 = 52$."
