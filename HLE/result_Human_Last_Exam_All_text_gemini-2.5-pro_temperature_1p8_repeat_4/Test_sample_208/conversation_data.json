    "This problem is a classic example of the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. The goal is to find the smallest possible radius of a large circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles of a given radius.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We are given fourteen small circles, each with a radius of `r = 1`. We need to arrange them in a \"tightly packed\" formation within a larger circle and find the radius `R` of this large circle. \"Tightly packed\" means the arrangement is the most efficient one possible, leading to the smallest possible large circle.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nature of the Problem:** This is a well-known problem in mathematics. For a small number of circles, the optimal packing arrangement is often symmetrical and can be calculated with geometry. However, for `N=14`, the arrangement is not simple or perfectly symmetrical. The solution is not easily derived from basic principles and relies on established results from computational geometry and numerical optimization.\n\n3.  **Consult Known Results:** Mathematicians have studied and cataloged the best-known packings for various numbers of circles. For `N=14`, the most efficient packing was found by F. Fodor in 2003. This arrangement features a central group of four circles surrounded by an outer ring of ten circles.\n\n4.  **Use the Established Ratio:** The solution to these packing problems is typically expressed as the ratio of the large circle's radius (`R`) to the small circle's radius (`r`). For `N=14`, the best-known ratio is:\n    `R / r ≈ 3.427649...`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Radius R:** We are given that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`. We can now calculate `R`:\n    `R = r * 3.427649...`\n    `R = 1 * 3.427649...`\n    `R ≈ 3.427649...`\n\n6.  **Round to the Required Precision:** The question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits. Let's analyze the number `3.427649...`:\n    *   1st significant digit: 3\n    *   2nd significant digit: 4\n    *   3rd significant digit: 2\n    *   4th significant digit: 7\n    *   5th significant digit: 6\n\n    Since the fifth significant digit (6) is 5 or greater, we must round up the fourth significant digit. So, 7 becomes 8.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The radius of the large circle, rounded to 4 significant digits, is `3.428`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Tightly packed\" is key:** This phrase specifies that we must find the minimal possible radius of the containing circle, which corresponds to the \"optimal packing\" arrangement.\n*   **Complexity of the arrangement:** Do not assume a simple, symmetrical layout. The optimal arrangement for N=14 is non-trivial and irregular. Trying to solve this with simple trigonometry from scratch is impractical.\n*   **Reliance on known results:** This problem is best solved by referencing the established results in the field of circle packing, as the calculations are highly complex.\n*   **Rounding:** Pay close attention to the rules for rounding to a specific number of significant digits. The 5th significant digit determines whether the 4th digit is rounded up or stays the same.\n\nThe radius of the large circle is approximately 3.427649... Rounding this to 4 significant digits gives 3.428.\n\n<<<3.428>>>"
