    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the given algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Purpose**\n    The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and an integer base `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. It does this by repeatedly dividing `n` by `c` and using the remainders as the digits of the new base representation, from least significant to most significant.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Computational Steps**\n    The algorithm consists of three main parts:\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization.** This step is executed only once.\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop.** This is the core of the algorithm, and its body is executed multiple times.\n    *   **Step 3: Return.** This step presents the final result.\n\n3.  **Cost of Initialization (Step 1)**\n    *   `i := 0;`: One assignment operation.\n    *   `x := n;`: One assignment operation.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: One division and one floor operation.\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;`: One multiplication and one subtraction. (This is equivalent to the modulo operation `x mod c`).\n    *   Assuming that `n` and `c` fit into a computer's word size, all these basic arithmetic and assignment operations take a constant amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of Step 1 is `O(1)`.\n\n4.  **Cost of the `while` loop (Step 2)**\n    To find the complexity of the loop, we need to determine two things:\n    a.  The cost of a single iteration of the loop.\n    b.  The number of times the loop iterates.\n\n    *   **a. Cost of a single iteration:**\n        The operations inside the loop (sub-step 2.1) are:\n        *   `i := i + 1;`: One addition, one assignment.\n        *   `x := q;`: One assignment.\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: One division, one floor.\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc;`: One multiplication, one subtraction.\n        Similar to the initialization step, these are all basic operations. Under the standard assumption that they take constant time, the cost of a single iteration of the `while` loop is `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **b. Number of loop iterations:**\n        The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace the value of `q`:\n        *   Before the loop, `q` is set to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   In the first iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   In the second iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c²⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋`, which is `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n        The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`, which is true if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`.\n        This inequality can be rewritten as `n < c^(k+1)`.\n        To find the number of iterations `k`, we can take the logarithm base `c` of both sides: `log_c(n) < k + 1`.\n        This means the number of iterations `k` is roughly `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n        Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The complexity contribution from the loop is the number of iterations multiplied by the cost per iteration: `O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\n5.  **Cost of the Return statement (Step 3)**\n    This step involves assembling the computed digits `a_i, a_{i-1}, ..., a_0` into a final representation. The number of digits is `i+1`, which is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The cost of this step is proportional to the number of digits, which is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n6.  **Total Computational Time Complexity**\n    The total time complexity `T(n)` is the sum of the complexities of all parts:\n    `T(n) = T(initialization) + T(loop) + T(return)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(log_c n)`\n    The dominant term in this sum is `O(log_c n)`.\n    Thus, the overall computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes a Random Access Machine (RAM) model where basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `mod`) on numbers that fit within a single machine word are considered to take constant `O(1)` time. This is a standard assumption in introductory algorithm analysis.\n\n2.  **Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic:** If `n` were an arbitrarily large number that does not fit into a single machine word, the cost of arithmetic operations would not be `O(1)`. For example, dividing a number with `k` bits by another number might take `O(k²)` or `O(k log k)` time, depending on the division algorithm used. In such a scenario, the complexity would be higher. The size of `n` in bits is `log_2(n)`. Summing the costs of divisions on decreasingly smaller numbers leads to an overall complexity of approximately `O((log n)²)` for arbitrary-precision numbers. However, unless specified otherwise, the standard `O(1)` assumption for arithmetic is used.\n\n3.  **Base of Logarithm:** In Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm can be changed by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`), so `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log n)` for any constant base `c > 1`. However, writing it as `O(log_c n)` is more specific to the context of the problem.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe complexity is determined by the `while` loop. The loop iterates once for each digit in the base-`c` representation of `n` (except the last one). The number of digits is proportional to `log_c(n)`. Since each iteration takes constant time under standard assumptions, the total time complexity is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n<<<O(log_c n)>>>"
