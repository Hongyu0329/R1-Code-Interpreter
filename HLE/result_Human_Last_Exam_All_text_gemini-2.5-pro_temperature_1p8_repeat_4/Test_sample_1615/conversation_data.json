    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of colours needed for the graph G.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**\n    *   We are given a graph $G$.\n    *   The number of vertices is $|V(G)| = n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n    *   The term \"maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\" is mentioned, which is a standard property of any finite graph. It doesn't impose an additional constraint on the type of graph we can consider.\n    *   The question asks for the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n2.  **Recall Fundamental Concepts of Graph Colouring**\n    *   A **proper vertex colouring** of a graph assigns a colour to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same colour.\n    *   The **chromatic number**, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colours required for a proper vertex colouring of $G$.\n    *   A **complete graph**, $K_n$, is a graph on $n$ vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For such a graph, every vertex needs a unique colour, so $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n    *   A general upper bound for the chromatic number of any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is $\\chi(G) \\le n$. The equality holds if and only if $G$ is a complete graph.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound for $\\chi(G)$**\n    *   We are given that the graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices and is *not* a complete graph.\n    *   Based on the properties mentioned above, since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of its vertices.\n    *   Mathematically, $G \\neq K_n \\implies \\chi(G) < n$.\n    *   Therefore, for our graph $G$, $\\chi(G) < 12345$.\n    *   This implies that the maximum possible value for $\\chi(G)$ is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n4.  **Verify if This Upper Bound is Achievable**\n    *   To confirm that 12344 is the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists at least one graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344.\n    *   Let's construct such a graph. Consider a graph $G^*$ formed by taking a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and adding one more vertex, $v$, which is isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n    *   This graph can be represented as $G^* = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Constructed Graph $G^*$**\n    *   **Number of vertices:** $|V(G^*)| = 12344 + 1 = 12345$. This matches the condition.\n    *   **Is it a complete graph?** No. The isolated vertex $v$ is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ component. Therefore, $G^* \\neq K_{12345}$. This also matches the condition.\n    *   **What is its chromatic number, $\\chi(G^*)$?** The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n        *   The first component is $K_{12344}$, and its chromatic number is $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n        *   The second component is the isolated vertex $v$ (which is a $K_1$), and its chromatic number is $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n        *   Therefore, $\\chi(G^*) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have established that for any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, the number of colours needed is at most 12344. We then constructed a specific graph that meets the criteria and requires exactly 12344 colours. This proves that the maximum possible number of colours is indeed 12344.\n\nAnother example of a graph that requires 12344 colours is the complete graph on 12345 vertices with a single edge removed ($K_{12345}-e$). This graph is not complete, and it contains a clique of size 12344, so its chromatic number is 12344.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   The phrase \"maximum number of colours that we need\" asks for the worst-case scenario (the maximum possible chromatic number) among all graphs that fit the description.\n*   The key condition is that the graph is *not* complete. This is what reduces the maximum possible chromatic number from $n$ to $n-1$.\n*   The reference to $\\Delta(G)$ does not impose a restriction, but rather acknowledges a standard graph parameter. The result aligns with Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$ unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. For our constructed graph $K_{12345}-e$, we have $\\chi(G) = 12344$ and $\\Delta(G)=12344$, which is consistent with the theorem.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum number of colours is the number of vertices minus one.\n$n - 1 = 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
