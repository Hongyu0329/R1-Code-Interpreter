    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"Triple Crown\" in Baseball**\n\nFirst, it's crucial to understand what the term \"Triple Crown\" means for a batter in Major League Baseball (MLB). A player achieves the batting Triple Crown by leading their respective league (either the American League or the National League) in three specific statistical categories in a single season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n**Careful Point:** A player only needs to lead their own league, not the entire MLB. For example, in 1933, two different players won the Triple Crownâ€”one in the American League and one in the National League.\n\n**Step 2: List the National League (NL) Triple Crown Winners**\n\nWe will list each player who has won the Triple Crown in the National League, including players from its early history and precursor major leagues like the American Association, which is historically recognized.\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887) - *Careful point:* He played in the American Association, which is considered a major league for historical statistical purposes.\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n4.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n5.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 and 1925) - *Careful point:* He won it twice, but he counts as one winner.\n6.  **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n7.  **Joe Medwick** (1937) - This was the last time a player won the Triple Crown in the National League.\n\nThis gives us a total of **7** unique winners from the National League.\n\n**Step 3: List the American League (AL) Triple Crown Winners**\n\nNext, we will list each player who has won the Triple Crown in the American League.\n\n1.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n2.  **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n3.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n4.  **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n5.  **Ted Williams** (1942 and 1947) - *Careful point:* Like Hornsby, he won it twice but is a single winner.\n6.  **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n7.  **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n8.  **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n9.  **Miguel Cabrera** (2012) - He is the most recent player to win a Triple Crown in either league.\n\nThis gives us a total of **9** unique winners from the American League.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Winners**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of \"winners,\" not the total number of times the Triple Crown has been won. Therefore, we need to count the unique players from both lists.\n\n*   National League Winners: 7\n*   American League Winners: 9\n\nTotal unique winners = 7 (from NL) + 9 (from AL) = 16.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBy systematically listing the winners from each league and counting the number of unique players, we arrive at the final number.\n\n<<<16>>>"
