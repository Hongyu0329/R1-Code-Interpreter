    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set $X$ equipped with a metric $d$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality: for any $x, y, z \\in X$, $d(x, z) \\leq \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$.\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete normed vector space over the real or complex numbers.\n*   **Cardinality (K):** The number of elements in the set $B$. Since $B$ is a Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ and is not the trivial space $\\{0\\}$ (which can only embed a single point), its cardinality $K$ must be infinite, and at least that of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the distance between their images in $B$ is equal to their distance in $X$. That is, $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Question\n\nThe question asks for \"the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of $X$ in $B$\". This means we are looking for the minimum value of the number of embeddings, where we can choose both the finite ultrametric space $X$ and the Banach space $B$ (of a given cardinality K).\nLet $Emb(X, B)$ be the set of all isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$. The question asks for the value of $\\min_{X, B} |Emb(X, B)|$, subject to the given conditions on $X$ and $B$. The number of embeddings is a non-negative integer or a cardinal number. Thus, the smallest possible value cannot be less than 0.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Case of Existence vs. Non-existence of Embeddings\n\nThe number of embeddings for a given pair $(X, B)$ can be zero if no such embedding exists. If we can find at least one valid pair $(X, B)$ for which there are no isometric embeddings, then the number of embeddings is 0. Since this is the lowest possible non-negative number, this would be our answer.\n\nLet's try to construct such a pair $(X, B)$.\n\n1.  **Choose the Cardinality K:** A common cardinality for a Banach space is $K = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n2.  **Choose a Banach Space B of Cardinality K:** Let's choose the simplest Banach space with this cardinality: $B = \\mathbb{R}$ with the usual norm $\\|x\\| = |x|$. The set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is a complete normed vector space, so it is a Banach space, and its cardinality is indeed $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n3.  **Choose a Finite Ultrametric Space X:** Consider a space $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$ consisting of three points, where the distance between any two distinct points is 1. That is, $d(a, b) = d(b, c) = d(a, c) = 1$. This is an \"equilateral triangle\" metric space. Let's verify that it is an ultrametric space. We need to check the strong triangle inequality. For instance, $d(a, c) = 1$, and $\\max(d(a, b), d(b, c)) = \\max(1, 1) = 1$. Since $1 \\le 1$, the inequality holds. The same applies to all other permutations of points. So, $X$ is a finite ultrametric space.\n4.  **Count the Embeddings:** We now determine the number of isometric embeddings of this $X$ into our chosen $B = \\mathbb{R}$. An embedding would be a function $f: \\{a, b, c\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, which corresponds to finding three points $v_a, v_b, v_c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n    *   $\\|v_a - v_b\\| = |v_a - v_b| = d(a, b) = 1$\n    *   $\\|v_b - v_c\\| = |v_b - v_c| = d(b, c) = 1$\n    *   $\\|v_a - v_c\\| = |v_a - v_c| = d(a, c) = 1$\n\n    Let's assume such points exist. Since they are distinct, they must be ordered on the real line. Let's assume, without loss of generality, that $v_a < v_b < v_c$.\n    From this ordering, we have:\n    *   $v_b - v_a = 1$\n    *   $v_c - v_b = 1$\n\n    Adding these two equations gives:\n    $(v_b - v_a) + (v_c - v_b) = 1 + 1$\n    $v_c - v_a = 2$\n\n    This implies $|v_c - v_a| = 2$. However, the condition for an isometric embedding requires $|v_c - v_a| = d(a, c) = 1$. We have reached a contradiction ($2=1$).\n    Any other ordering of the points would lead to the same contradiction. Thus, there are no three points in $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the distance requirements.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Number of Embeddings:** For this specific choice of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ (of cardinality $K=2^{\\aleph_0}$), the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nSince the number of embeddings must be a non-negative value, and we have found a valid instance where the number is 0, the smallest possible number of embeddings is 0.\n\n---\n#### Further Analysis (Confirming No Lower Bound Greater Than 0)\n\nOne might wonder if an embedding must always exist. If for every pair $(X, B)$, an embedding was guaranteed, the answer would be different.\nLet's assume an embedding $f_0: X \\to B$ exists.\n*   **Lower Bound on the number of embeddings:** For any vector $v \\in B$, the translated map $f_v(x) = f_0(x) + v$ is also an isometric embedding. Since each $v \\in B$ gives a distinct map, this provides at least $|B| = K$ embeddings.\n*   **Upper Bound on the number of embeddings:** An embedding is a function from $X$ to $B$. The set of all such functions is $B^X$. The cardinality of this set is $|B|^{|X|} = K^{|X|}$. Since $K$ is an infinite cardinal and $|X|$ is a finite number greater than 0, $K^{|X|} = K$. The set of embeddings is a subset of $B^X$, so its cardinality is at most $K$.\n\nCombining these, if at least one embedding exists, the total number of embeddings is exactly $K$.\n\nSo, the set of all possible numbers of embeddings is $\\{0, K\\}$. The smallest number in this set is 0. The problem formulation asks for the \"smallest possible number\", which means we are allowed to select the pair $(X,B)$ that minimizes this value. As demonstrated, a value of 0 is achievable."
