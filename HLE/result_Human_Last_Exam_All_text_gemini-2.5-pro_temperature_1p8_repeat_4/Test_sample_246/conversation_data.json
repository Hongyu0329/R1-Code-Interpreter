    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the manifold and its fundamental group.\n\nLet $K$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which is a knotted 2-sphere embedded in $S^4$. Let $X$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ branched over $K$. We want to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\nThe fundamental group of a double branched cover of an $n$-sphere over a knotted $(n-2)$-sphere can be computed using a standard formula from knot theory. Let $\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$ be the fundamental group of the complement of the 2-knot $K$. Let $m \\in \\Pi$ be an element representing a meridian of $K$. The fundamental group of the double branched cover $X$ is given by the quotient group:\n$\\pi_1(X) = \\Pi / \\langle\\langle m^2 \\rangle\\rangle$,\nwhere $\\langle\\langle m^2 \\rangle\\rangle$ denotes the normal closure of the element $m^2$. This amounts to adding the relation $m^2=1$ to the presentation of $\\Pi$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the fundamental group of the complement of the 2-knot.\n\nThe fundamental group of the complement of an $m$-twist-spun knot is also a standard result. Let $T$ be the trefoil knot in $S^3$, and let $G_T = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus T)$ be its knot group. Let $\\mu \\in G_T$ be an element representing a meridian of the trefoil knot. The fundamental group $\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$ of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil $K$ is the quotient of $G_T$ by the normal subgroup generated by all commutators of $\\mu^5$ with elements of $G_T$. In other words, the element $\\mu^5$ becomes central in $\\Pi$.\n$\\Pi = G_T / \\langle\\langle [\\mu^5, g] = 1 \\text{ for all } g \\in G_T \\rangle\\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Find a presentation for the knot group of the trefoil.\n\nA standard Wirtinger presentation for the trefoil knot group is:\n$G_T = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy \\rangle$.\nIn this presentation, the generators $x$ and $y$ themselves represent meridians of the trefoil knot. All meridians of a given knot are conjugate in the knot group.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the presentations to get a presentation for $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\nLet's choose the meridian $\\mu$ to be the generator $x$. So, the group $\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$ is given by adding the relations that $x^5$ is central to the presentation of $G_T$. A set of generators for $G_T$ is $\\{x, y\\}$, so we only need to add the relations $[x^5, x]=1$ and $[x^5, y]=1$.\nThe relation $[x^5, x]=1$ is trivial. So, the presentation for $\\Pi$ is:\n$\\Pi = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy, x^5y = yx^5 \\rangle$.\n\nNow, to find $\\pi_1(X)$, we take the quotient of $\\Pi$ by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian. Since $x$ is a meridian, we add the relation $x^2=1$:\n$\\pi_1(X) = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy, x^5y = yx^5, x^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the presentation of $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\nLet's analyze the relations in the presentation for $\\pi_1(X)$:\n1.  **Relation $x^2=1$**: This implies that $x=x^{-1}$.\n2.  **Relation $x^5y=yx^5$**: Since $x^2=1$, we have $x^5 = (x^2)^2 x = 1^2 x = x$. The relation simplifies to $xy = yx$. This means the generators $x$ and $y$ commute in this group.\n3.  **Relation $xyx=yxy$**: Since $x$ and $y$ commute, we can rearrange the terms: $x(yx) = y(xy) \\implies x(xy) = y(yx)$. This gives $x^2y = y^2x$.\n4.  **Combining relations**: Now we have a simplified system of relations:\n    *   $x^2=1$\n    *   $xy=yx$\n    *   $x^2y=y^2x$\n\n    Substitute $x^2=1$ into the third relation:\n    $1 \\cdot y = y^2x \\implies y = y^2x$.\n    Since $y$ is a generator, it is invertible. We can multiply by $y^{-1}$ on the left:\n    $y^{-1}y = y^{-1}y^2x \\implies 1 = yx$.\n    This implies that $y=x^{-1}$.\n5.  **Final simplification**: Since $x^2=1$, we have $x^{-1}=x$. Therefore, $y=x$. This means that the generator $y$ is not independent and can be expressed in terms of $x$. We can substitute $y=x$ back into all the original relations to check for consistency:\n    *   $xyx=yxy$ becomes $xxx=xxx$, i.e., $x^3=x^3$. Since $x^2=1$, this is $x=x$, which is consistent.\n    *   $x^5y=yx^5$ becomes $x^5x=xx^5$, i.e., $x^6=x^6$. Since $x^2=1$, this is $1=1$, which is consistent.\n    *   $x^2=1$ is the defining relation for the resulting group.\n\nThe group $\\pi_1(X)$ simplifies to a group with one generator $x$ and one relation $x^2=1$.\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\langle x \\mid x^2=1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the minimal number of generators.\n\nThe group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a cyclic group of order 2. It can be generated by a single element (the non-trivial one). Therefore, the minimal number of generators is 1."
