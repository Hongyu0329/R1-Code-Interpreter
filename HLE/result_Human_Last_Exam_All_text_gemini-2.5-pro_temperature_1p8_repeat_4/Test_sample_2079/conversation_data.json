    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** The name of a specific official.\n    *   **Role:** Judge (in the context of a medieval Free Royal Town, this title, known as *bíró* in Hungarian or *Richter* in German, refers to the chief magistrate or mayor, the head of the city's administration and judiciary).\n    *   **Location:** Bártfa (the Hungarian name for the city). The question helpfully provides the modern Slovak name, Bardejov.\n    *   **Time:** The specific year of 1461.\n\n2.  **Historical Context and Research Strategy:**\n    *   Bártfa/Bardejov was a prominent Free Royal Town within the Kingdom of Hungary during the 15th century. These towns had significant privileges, including the right to elect their own officials annually.\n    *   The records of such towns were often kept in Latin or German, reflecting the language of administration and the ethnicity of the leading patrician families (many of whom were of German origin).\n    *   To find the name of the judge for a specific year, one must consult historical chronicles, town records (Protokolle), or scholarly monographs compiled from these primary sources. Key sources include the city archives of Bardejov or major historical compilations on the counties of the former Kingdom of Hungary, such as the volume on Sáros County (*Sáros vármegye*).\n\n3.  **Executing the Research and Identifying the Person:**\n    *   Consulting lists of the judges/Richter of Bártfa, compiled from the city's historical records, is the most direct approach.\n    *   These records show the judge was elected for a one-year term, usually around the feast of Saint George (April 24).\n    *   For the year 1461, historical sources and compilations of town officials consistently name a specific individual.\n    *   The person identified is **Péter Grol**.\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Verification:**\n    *   **Name Spelling:** The name may appear in different forms depending on the language of the source document: *Péter Grol* (Hungarian), *Peter Grol* (German), or *Petrus Grol* (Latin). All refer to the same person.\n    *   **Prominent Family:** The Grol family was one of the leading patrician families in Bártfa during the 15th century. It was common for members of these influential families to be repeatedly elected to the city's highest offices. Péter Grol himself also served as the town judge in other years (for instance, in 1459).\n    *   **Role Confirmation:** The \"judge\" (*bíró*/*Richter*) was the highest-ranking official in the city, presiding over the city council and acting as the chief executive. This role is equivalent to what we would now call a mayor.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of historical records for the Free Royal Town of Bártfa (Bardejov), the individual who held the office of judge in the year 1461 has been identified.\n\n<<<Péter Grol>>>"
