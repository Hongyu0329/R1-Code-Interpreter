    "This problem asks for the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. This implies a time-aliasing operation. We will first find the 8-point DFT of the given sequence and then derive the 4-point DFT from it using the properties of the DFT.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the target sequence and its DFT**\n\nLet the given 8-point sequence be `z(n)`:\n`z(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nLet the 8-point DFT of `z(n)` be `Z(k)`. Finding the 4-point DFT of this 8-point sequence means we need to find the DFT of a 4-point sequence `y(n)` which is formed by aliasing `z(n)` in time.\nThe time-aliased 4-point sequence `y(n)` is defined as:\n`y(n) = z(n) + z(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThe 4-point DFT of `y(n)`, let's call it `Y(k)`, is related to the 8-point DFT `Z(k)` by the property of decimation-in-frequency:\n`Y(k) = Z(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nTherefore, our goal is to find `Z(0)`, `Z(2)`, `Z(4)`, and `Z(6)`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the 8-point DFT Z(k) to the given 4-point DFTs X(k) and H(k)**\n\nThe sequence `z(n)` is an interleaving of the sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The even-indexed samples of `z(n)` are from `x(n)`: `z(2m) = x(m)` for `m=0,1,2,3`.\n*   The odd-indexed samples of `z(n)` are from `h(n)`: `z(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m=0,1,2,3`.\n\nThe 8-point DFT `Z(k)` can be expressed as:\n`Z(k) = Σ_{n=0 to 7} z(n) * W_8^(nk)`\nwhere `W_N = e^(-j2π/N)`.\n\nSplitting the sum into even and odd parts of `n`:\n`Z(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} z(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0 to 3} z(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n`Z(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * (W_8^2)^(mk) + W_8^k * Σ_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * (W_8^2)^(mk)`\n\nSince `W_8^2 = e^(-j2π*2/8) = e^(-j2π/4) = W_4`, the sums are the 4-point DFTs of `x(m)` and `h(m)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)` respectively (with modulo-4 periodicity).\n`Z(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required components of Z(k)**\n\nWe need `Y(k) = [Z(0), Z(2), Z(4), Z(6)]`.\n\nGiven data:\n`X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n`H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe need the following twiddle factors `W_8^k`:\n*   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-j2π*2/8) = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^4 = e^(-j2π*4/8) = e^(-jπ) = -1`\n*   `W_8^6 = e^(-j2π*6/8) = e^(-j3π/2) = j`\n\nNow, let's calculate `Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3)`.\n\n*   **For Y(0) = Z(0):** (`k=0`)\n    `Y(0) = Z(0) = X(0 mod 4) + W_8^0 * H(0 mod 4) = X(0) + 1 * H(0)`\n    `Y(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For Y(1) = Z(2):** (`k=2`)\n    `Y(1) = Z(2) = X(2 mod 4) + W_8^2 * H(2 mod 4) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2)`\n    `Y(1) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For Y(2) = Z(4):** (`k=4`)\n    `Y(2) = Z(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0)`\n    `Y(2) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For Y(3) = Z(6):** (`k=6`)\n    `Y(3) = Z(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4) = X(2) + (j) * H(2)`\n    `Y(3) = -1 + (j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nCombining the results, the 4-point DFT is:\n`Y(k) = [Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3)] = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Interpreting the Question:** The main challenge is realizing that finding a \"4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence\" implies time-aliasing. This means the result `Y(k)` is obtained by decimating the 8-point DFT `Z(k)` in frequency, i.e., `Y(k) = Z(2k)`.\n2.  **DFT of Interleaved Sequence:** The formula `Z(k) = X(k \\pmod 4) + W_8^k H(k \\pmod 4)` is crucial. It's the cornerstone for solving the problem without going to the time domain.\n3.  **Twiddle Factors:** Be careful with calculating the `W_N^k` values. `W_8^2 = -j`, not `-1`. `W_8^4 = -1`. `W_8^6 = j`.\n4.  **Modulo Arithmetic:** When `k` in `Z(k)` is greater than or equal to 4, remember to take `k mod 4` to get the correct index for `X` and `H`. For instance, for `Z(6)`, we use `X(2)` and `H(2)`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
