    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Source Material:** The question specifies the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\" and the exact episode, \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". This narrows down the search to a single, specific piece of media.\n\n2.  **Locate the Relevant Scene:** The question asks about the Junior prom. In \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the main event is the girls attending their Junior prom.\n\n3.  **Identify the \"Performer\":** The question notes that the performer is a \"cardboard cutout\". During the prom scene, the comic shows a stage with the \"musical guest\". Instead of a live band or person, it is a life-sized cardboard cutout.\n\n4.  **Read the On-Screen Text:** In the Homestar Runner series, especially Teen Girl Squad, much of the information and humor comes from handwritten text within the comic panels. In the scene with the performer, there is an arrow pointing to the cutout, and the text next to it explicitly names the character.\n\n5.  **Extract the Name:** The text written on the paper comic panel reads: \"Cardboard Cutout of **TARANCHULA**\".\n\n6.  **Confirm the Character:** Taranchula is a recurring fictional character within the Homestar Runner universe. She is portrayed as a somber, acoustic folk singer, serving as a parody of 1990s alternative female singer-songwriters. This confirms she fits the description of a \"fictional singer\".\n\nTherefore, the cardboard cutout performing at the Junior prom is of the fictional singer Taranchula.\n\n<<<Taranchula>>>"
