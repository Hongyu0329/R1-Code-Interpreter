    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to determine the transformation rule that converts the input grids into the output grids. Then, apply this rule to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`. The inputs and outputs are grids of digits represented as comma-separated strings.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Transformation in Example A**\n\n*   **Input_A**: `001111,121111,111111`\n    Grid A (Input):\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1  (Row 0)\n    1 2 1 1 1 1  (Row 1)\n    1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n    ```\n*   **Output_A**: `201111,101111,111111`\n    Grid A (Output):\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Comparison**:\n    *   The digit `2` was at position `(1, 1)`. It has moved.\n    *   The original position `(1, 1)` now contains `0`.\n    *   A new `2` has appeared at position `(0, 0)`.\n    *   The original value at `(0, 0)` was `0`.\n*   **Observation**: The `2` at `(1, 1)` effectively swapped with the `0` at `(0, 0)`. The movement is one step up and one step left (Up-Left).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Transformation in Example B**\n\n*   **Input_B**: `0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111`\n    Grid B (Input):\n    (Showing relevant section)\n    ```\n    ...\n    R2: ...0 0 0 0... (at cols 4,5,6,7)\n    R3: ...0 0 2 1... (at cols 4,5,6,7)\n    ...\n    ```\n*   **Output_B**: `0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111`\n    Grid B (Output):\n    (Showing relevant section)\n    ```\n    ...\n    R2: ...0 0 0 2...\n    R3: ...0 0 0 1...\n    ...\n    ```\n*   **Comparison**:\n    *   The digit `2` was at position `(3, 6)`.\n    *   The original position `(3, 6)` now contains `0`.\n    *   A new `2` has appeared at position `(2, 7)`.\n    *   The original value at `(2, 7)` was `0`.\n*   **Observation**: The `2` at `(3, 6)` swapped with the `0` at `(2, 7)`. The movement is one step up and one step right (Up-Right).\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis**\n\nThe core mechanic is the movement of `2` into a `0`'s location. The key is to figure out the rule that dictates the direction of movement.\n\n*   In A, the move is Up-Left. The starting coordinate of `2` is `(1, 1)`. Both coordinates are odd.\n*   In B, the move is Up-Right. The starting coordinate of `2` is `(3, 6)`. The row is odd, the column is even.\n\nThis suggests a pattern based on the parity (odd/even) of the `2`'s starting coordinates `(r, c)`.\n\n*   **Rule Hypothesis**:\n    *   If `r` is odd and `c` is odd, the `2` attempts to move Up-Left to `(r-1, c-1)`.\n    *   If `r` is odd and `c` is even, the `2` attempts to move Up-Right to `(r-1, c+1)`.\n    *   This move only occurs if the target cell contains a `0`.\n\nThis hypothesis correctly explains the behavior in both Example A and Example B.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Rule to Input_C to Find the Missing Output**\n\n*   **Input_C**: `000000,011120,111111`\n    Grid C (Input):\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0  (Row 0)\n    0 1 1 1 2 0  (Row 1)\n    1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n    ```\n1.  **Find the `2`**: The `2` is located at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n2.  **Check Parity**: The row `1` is odd. The column `4` is even. This matches the `(odd, even)` case.\n3.  **Determine Move Direction**: According to our rule, the `2` should move Up-Right to `(r-1, c+1)`, which is `(1-1, 4+1) = (0, 5)`.\n4.  **Check Target Cell**: The value at the target cell `(0, 5)` is `0`. The move is valid.\n5.  **Perform the Transformation**:\n    *   The value at the original position `(1, 4)` becomes `0`.\n    *   The value at the target position `(0, 5)` becomes `2`.\n6.  **Construct the Final Grid**:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 2\n    0 1 1 1 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n7.  **Convert to String Format**: `000002,011100,111111`\n\nThis is the value for `MISSING`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
