    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Question:** What would the oligomeric state be of this protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`? Based off of understanding of knobs-into-holes interactions and packing efficiency.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Pattern\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a repeating seven-residue pattern, known as a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the coiled-coil structure. The stability and oligomeric state of the coiled-coil are largely determined by the identity of the amino acids at these `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's analyze the given sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\n1.  **Find the hydrophobic residues:** We look for hydrophobic amino acids which are likely to be at the core positions `a` and `d`. These include Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), Alanine (A), Methionine (M), Phenylalanine (F), Tryptophan (W).\n    The hydrophobic residues in the sequence are:\n    `I` at position 3\n    `L` at position 7\n    `I` at position 10\n    `L` at position 14\n    `I` at position 17\n    `W` at position 19 (a large hydrophobe)\n    `L` at position 21\n    `I` at position 24\n    `L` at position 28\n\n2.  **Determine the register (`a` and `d` positions):** In a heptad repeat, the spacing between `a` and `d` is 3 residues (`a-b-c-d`), and the spacing between `d` of one heptad and `a` of the next is 4 residues (`d-e-f-g-a`).\n    *   Distance from `I(3)` to `L(7)` is 4 positions. This fits the `d-a` spacing.\n    *   Distance from `L(7)` to `I(10)` is 3 positions. This fits the `a-d` spacing.\n    *   This `4-3-4-3...` spacing pattern continues through the sequence (`L(14)-I(10)=4`, `I(17)-L(14)=3`, `L(21)-I(17)=4`, `I(24)-L(21)=3`, `L(28)-I(24)=4`).\n\n3.  **Assign the `a` and `d` positions:** Based on the spacing, we can confidently assign the register.\n    *   The residues at positions 3, 10, 17, 24 are at the **`d` position**.\n    *   The residues at positions 7, 14, 21, 28 are at the **`a` position**.\n\n    Let's list the residues at these core positions:\n    *   **`a` positions:** L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28) -> All are **Leucine (L)**.\n    *   **`d` positions:** I(3), I(10), I(17), I(24) -> All are **Isoleucine (I)**.\n\nThe Tryptophan (`W`) at position 19 falls into the `f` position (`d=I(17), e=A(18), f=W(19)`), which is a surface-exposed position. While unusual, it does not dictate the core packing.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Core Packing via \"Knobs-into-Holes\"\n\nThe oligomeric state is determined by how efficiently the side chains (the \"knobs\") at the `a` and `d` positions can pack into the hydrophobic core (the \"holes\"). The key difference between our core residues is that **Isoleucine (I) is branched at the beta-carbon**, while **Leucine (L) is not**.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a dimer, `a` positions pack against `a` positions on the partner helix (`a-a'`), and `d` positions pack against `d` positions (`d-d'`). Packing two beta-branched Isoleucines against each other (`I-I'`) at the `d` position can introduce steric strain, making it less favorable than packing non-branched Leucines. While possible, it's not the most efficient packing.\n\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** The packing geometry is more complex. Studies have shown that stable trimers typically favor a beta-branched residue (like `I` or `V`) at the `a` position and a non-beta-branched residue (like `L`) at the `d` position. Our sequence has the opposite pattern (`a=L`, `d=I`), which is geometrically disfavored for a trimeric structure.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** In a parallel four-helix bundle, the `a` residues from all four helices form one layer of packing, and the `d` residues form the next layer. A highly stable motif for tetramers is to have alternating layers of beta-branched and non-beta-branched residues. The pattern `a=L, d=I` (or the reverse, `a=I, d=L`) is a classic signature of a tetrameric coiled-coil. This arrangement allows the four Leucine side chains to interdigitate efficiently in their layers, and the four Isoleucine side chains to pack well in theirs, avoiding the steric clashes that might occur in a dimer or the unfavorable geometry of a trimer.\n\n*   **Pentamer (5 helices) and higher:** These structures have very crowded cores. To accommodate this, the `a` position is often a small (e.g., Alanine) or polar residue to reduce steric clash. Having a large residue like Leucine (`L`) at all the `a` positions would cause significant over-packing and instability in a pentameric core.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe repeating core pattern of the sequence is `a=Leucine` and `d=Isoleucine`. This specific arrangement of non-beta-branched and beta-branched residues is a well-established and highly favorable motif for the formation of a stable **tetrameric (4-helix)** coiled-coil. The other oligomeric states are significantly less likely based on packing efficiency principles.\n\nFinal Answer is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
