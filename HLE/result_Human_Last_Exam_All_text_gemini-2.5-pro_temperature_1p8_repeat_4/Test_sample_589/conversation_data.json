    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key identifiable elements.**\nThe query asks for a specific film based on the following criteria:\n*   **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n*   **Producer:** Produced by a major film studio.\n*   **Character:** A teenager.\n*   **Key Prop:** A pink bike.\n*   **Key Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Identify potential films based on the key elements.**\nThe combination of a teenager, a pink bike, and a game of \"chicken\" with a car is very specific. This description strongly points to a memorable scene in the 2004 film *Napoleon Dynamite*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the candidate film, *Napoleon Dynamite*, against the criteria.**\n*   **Is it a Hollywood feature film?** Yes, *Napoleon Dynamite* is a full-length feature film that received a wide theatrical release.\n*   **Was it produced by a major film studio?** Yes. While it started as an independent film, it was produced and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures (the specialty division of major studio 20th Century Fox at the time), MTV Films, and Paramount Vantage (a division of major studio Paramount Pictures). This satisfies the \"major studio\" criterion.\n*   **Does it feature a teenager on a pink bike?** Yes. The character Deb, a high school teenager, owns and rides a distinctive light pink/peach-colored bicycle throughout the film.\n*   **Does this teenager pedal directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. There is a specific and memorable scene where Deb is riding her pink bike. Uncle Rico, driving his van, approaches her from the opposite direction. Neither character swerves, and Deb continues to pedal directly at the van, forcing Uncle Rico to slam on his brakes at the last second, stopping just inches from her front wheel.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the findings.**\nThe film *Napoleon Dynamite* contains a scene that precisely matches every element described in the question. The character Deb is a teenager, she rides a pink bike, and she purposefully pedals it head-on toward Uncle Rico's oncoming van in a scene that establishes her character's quiet determination. The film was also produced and distributed by divisions of major Hollywood studios.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
