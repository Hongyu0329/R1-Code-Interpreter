    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the gene that should be knocked out.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Problem**\nThe goal is to produce p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*. The biosynthesis genes have been successfully introduced, and the organism is making the product. However, *C. glutamicum*, being a soil bacterium, possesses natural metabolic pathways to utilize various aromatic compounds, including p-coumaric acid, as a carbon and energy source. This native degradation pathway is consuming the desired product, leading to low yields.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a Strategy**\nTo prevent the loss of p-coumaric acid, we must block its degradation pathway. The most efficient way to do this is to identify the very first enzymatic step in the catabolic pathway that uses p-coumaric acid as a substrate and then knock out the gene encoding that enzyme. This will create a metabolic block, preventing the product from being channeled into the degradation route and causing it to accumulate.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Degradation Pathway of p-Coumaric Acid in *C. glutamicum***\nWe need to determine how *C. glutamicum* breaks down p-coumaric acid.\n*   **Activation Step:** The first step in the bacterial degradation of many aromatic acids, including p-coumaric acid and the structurally similar ferulic acid, is an \"activation\" step. This involves converting the carboxylic acid into a more reactive thioester by attaching Coenzyme A (CoA).\n*   **Reaction:** p-coumaric acid + CoA + ATP â†’ p-coumaroyl-CoA + AMP + PPi\n*   This reaction makes the molecule ready for subsequent breakdown, which typically proceeds via a pathway similar to the beta-oxidation of fatty acids.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Enzyme and Gene**\nThe enzyme responsible for the activation step described above is a CoA ligase.\n*   **Enzyme Name:** In *C. glutamicum*, the enzyme that activates p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid is called **Feruloyl-CoA synthetase**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Although its name suggests specificity for ferulic acid, this enzyme has a broad substrate range and is well-documented to be the key enzyme for activating p-coumaric acid as well.\n*   **Gene Name:** The gene that codes for Feruloyl-CoA synthetase in *C. glutamicum* is designated as **`fcs`**. (In the common ATCC 13032 strain, the locus tag is `cg3080` or `NCgl2711`).\n\n**Step 5: Justify the Knockout Target**\n*   By knocking out the `fcs` gene, the cell loses the ability to produce Feruloyl-CoA synthetase.\n*   Without this enzyme, the cell cannot convert p-coumaric acid into p-coumaroyl-CoA.\n*   Since the formation of p-coumaroyl-CoA is the first and essential step for entering the degradation pathway, knocking out `fcs` effectively stops the degradation of p-coumaric acid at its entry point.\n*   This has been experimentally verified in multiple metabolic engineering studies, where the deletion of the `fcs` gene leads to a significant increase in the accumulation of p-coumaric acid.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTo prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid produced in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, the most effective strategy is to knock out the gene responsible for the initial activation step of the catabolic pathway. This gene is `fcs`, which encodes Feruloyl-CoA synthetase.\n\n<<<fcs>>>"
