    "This problem asks for the integer $n$ for which any tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable, where $J$ is an upper semilattice. We will analyze this question step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology**\n    *   **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements have a least upper bound (or join). We can view a poset $J$ as a category where objects are the elements of $J$ and there's a unique morphism from $x$ to $y$ if and only if $x \\le y$.\n    *   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**: This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a $K$-vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(i \\to j): f(i) \\to f(j)$ to each relation $i \\le j$, respecting composition. The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of modules over the **poset algebra** $A=KJ$. For simplicity, we assume $J$ is a finite poset, which is standard in representation theory classification.\n    *   **Tame Functor**: The representation type of an algebra (and thus a poset) is classified as finite, tame, or wild. This is known as the trichotomy theorem. A functor being \"tame\" implies it is an indecomposable representation belonging to a category of tame representation type. The existence of even one such functor implies that the entire category $\\text{Rep}(J,K)$ is of tame type.\n    *   **$n$-resolvable**: A functor (or module) $f$ is $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. That is, there exists an exact sequence $0 \\to P_n \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$, where each $P_i$ is a projective representation. This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$, is at most $n$.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Concepts to Algebra**\n    The question is asking for a universal bound $n$ on the projective dimension of any indecomposable representation $f$ of a poset $J$, given that $J$ is an upper semilattice and of tame representation type. This is a question about the global homological properties of the module category over the algebra $KJ$. The most relevant property is the **global dimension** of the algebra, $\\text{gldim}(KJ)$, which is the supremum of projective dimensions of all modules.\n\n3.  **Key Properties of the Poset Algebra $KJ$**\n    *   **Schurian Algebra**: An algebra $A$ is called schurian if for any two indecomposable projective modules $P$ and $Q$, we have $\\dim_K \\text{Hom}_A(P, Q) \\le 1$. For a poset algebra $A=KJ$, the indecomposable projective representations are $P_j$ for each $j \\in J$. By the Yoneda lemma, $\\text{Hom}_A(P_i, P_j) \\cong P_j(i)$. The representation $P_j(i)$ is $K$ if $i \\le j$ and $0$ otherwise. Since there is at most one morphism from $i$ to $j$ in the category $J$, we have $\\dim_K \\text{Hom}_A(P_i, P_j) \\le 1$. Thus, any poset algebra $KJ$ is a schurian algebra.\n    *   **Representation Type**: The problem states there is a \"tame functor\", which implies that the algebra $KJ$ is of tame representation type.\n\n4.  **Applying a Key Theorem from Representation Theory**\n    There is a fundamental result by A. Skowroński and S. O. Smalø concerning schurian algebras:\n    **Theorem (Skowroński-Smalø)**: A schurian algebra $A$ is either of wild representation type or its global dimension is at most 2 (i.e., $\\text{gldim}(A) \\le 2$).\n    The contrapositive of this theorem states that if a schurian algebra is of tame or finite representation type, its global dimension must be at most 2.\n    \n    Since we have established that $KJ$ is a schurian algebra and it is of tame representation type, this theorem directly applies. Therefore, we can conclude that $\\text{gldim}(KJ) \\le 2$.\n\n5.  **Deriving the Bound on $n$**\n    The global dimension of an algebra is the maximum projective dimension over all possible modules. The fact that $\\text{gldim}(KJ) \\le 2$ means that for *any* representation $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, its projective dimension $\\text{pd}(f)$ must be less than or equal to 2.\n    This implies that any such functor is 2-resolvable. So, the value $n$ we are looking for is at most 2.\n\n6.  **Showing the Bound is Sharp**\n    To show that $n=2$ is the best possible answer, we must demonstrate that $n=1$ is not sufficient. We need to find an example of a poset $J$ that is an upper semilattice and is of tame (or finite, which is a sub-class of tame) type, for which there exists a representation $f$ with $\\text{pd}(f) = 2$.\n\n    Consider the \"diamond\" poset $J = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ with the relations $a<b<d$ and $a<c<d$.\n    *   **Upper Semilattice**: This poset is a lattice (a special case of an upper semilattice). For instance, the join of $b$ and $c$ is $d$.\n    *   **Representation Type**: This poset is of finite representation type, which is a sub-class of tame type.\n    *   **Global Dimension**: Let's find the projective dimension of the simple representation $S_a$ corresponding to the minimal element $a$. $S_a$ is the representation where $S_a(a) = K$ and $S_a(x) = 0$ for $x \\ne a$. The minimal projective resolution of $S_a$ over the algebra $KJ$ is:\n        $$0 \\to P_d \\to P_b \\oplus P_c \\to P_a \\to S_a \\to 0$$\n        where $P_x$ is the indecomposable projective representation corresponding to the element $x \\in J$. Since this resolution has length 2, we have $\\text{pd}(S_a) = 2$.\n\n    Since there exists a functor on a tame upper semilattice with a projective dimension of exactly 2, the universal upper bound $n$ cannot be smaller than 2.\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom our analysis, we have shown that for any tame functor $f$ on an upper semilattice $J$, its projective dimension is at most 2. We have also shown an example where the projective dimension is exactly 2. Therefore, any such functor is 2-resolvable, and 2 is the smallest integer for which this is universally true. The role of the \"upper semilattice\" property is to ensure that the class of objects we are considering includes cases like the diamond poset, which sets the sharp bound."
