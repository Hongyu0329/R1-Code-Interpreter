Given that IL-15 promotes the development of functionally superior, less differentiated memory T cells, it would be predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with IL-15 would exhibit an increased release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15.
