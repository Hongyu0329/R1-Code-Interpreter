    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe user wants to find the Hopf charge of a given vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)`.\n\n**1. Understand the vector field `n`**\n\nThe vector field is defined as:\n`f = atan2(y,x)`\n`r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n`G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n`nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis is a representation of a unit vector in spherical coordinates, where `G` is the polar angle (`theta`) and `f` is the azimuthal angle (`phi`).\n`n = (sin(theta)cos(phi), sin(theta)sin(phi), cos(theta))`\nwith `theta(x,y,z) = G(x,y,z)` and `phi(x,y,z) = f(x,y,z)`.\nThis defines a map `n: R^3 -> S^2`.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Boundary Condition**\nFor the Hopf charge to be a well-defined integer, the vector field `n` must tend to a constant value at infinity. Let's check this condition.\nAs `(x,y,z) -> infinity`, the term `x*x+y*y` or `z*z` goes to infinity.\nThis means `r2 -> infinity`.\nThen `exp(-10*r2) -> 0`.\nSo, `G = PI * exp(-10*r2) -> 0`.\nIn this limit, `theta -> 0`. The vector `n` becomes:\n`nx = sin(0)*cos(f) = 0`\n`ny = sin(0)*sin(f) = 0`\n`nz = cos(0) = 1`\nSo, `n(x,y,z) -> (0, 0, 1)` as `(x,y,z) -> infinity`.\nThe condition is satisfied. This allows us to think of the map as being from the compactified space `R^3 U {inf}`, which is topologically equivalent to the 3-sphere `S^3`, to the 2-sphere `S^2`. The Hopf charge is the topological invariant of this map `n: S^3 -> S^2`.\n\n**2. Interpret the Hopf Charge Geometrically**\n\nThe Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of two regular points on the target sphere `S^2`.\n`H = Link(n^{-1}(p1), n^{-1}(p2))`\nwhere `p1` and `p2` are two distinct points on `S^2`.\n\nLet's choose two convenient points: the South Pole `p1 = (0,0,-1)` and a point on the equator, say `p2 = (1,0,0)`.\n\n**3. Find the preimage of the South Pole `n^{-1}(0,0,-1)`**\n\nThe vector `n` points to the South Pole when its polar angle `theta = G` is `PI`.\n`G = PI` => `PI * exp(-10*r2) = PI`\n=> `exp(-10*r2) = 1`\n=> `-10*r2 = 0` => `r2 = 0`.\nNow we use the definition of `r2`:\n`r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 + z*z) = 0`\nThis equation is satisfied only if both terms under the square root are zero:\n1.  `z*z = 0` => `z=0`.\n2.  `(x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 = 0` => `x*x+y*y-0.5 = 0` => `x^2+y^2 = 0.5`.\n\nSo, the preimage of the South Pole is a circle in the `z=0` plane (the xy-plane) centered at the origin with radius `sqrt(0.5) = 1/sqrt(2)`. Let's call this circle `C_1`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Choice of points for preimage**\nWe chose the South Pole. Let's check if it is a regular value. The derivative of the map should have full rank at the preimages. The structure of this field is a standard Hopfion, where the core (preimage of the pole) is a curve. Choosing a pole is a very common and valid approach.\n\n**4. Find the preimage of an equatorial point `n^{-1}(1,0,0)`**\n\nThe vector `n` points to `(1,0,0)` when:\n`nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1`\n`ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 0`\n`nz = cos(G) = 0`\n\nFrom `nz = cos(G) = 0`, we get `G = PI/2` (since the range of G is `(0, PI]`).\nSubstitute this into `nx` and `ny`:\n`sin(PI/2)sin(f) = sin(f) = 0` => `f = 0` or `f = PI`.\n`sin(PI/2)cos(f) = cos(f) = 1` => `f = 0`.\nSo we need points `(x,y,z)` where `G = PI/2` and `f = 0`.\n\nCondition `f = atan2(y,x) = 0` implies `y=0` and `x>0`.\nCondition `G = PI/2`:\n`PI * exp(-10*r2) = PI/2`\n=> `exp(-10*r2) = 1/2`\n=> `-10*r2 = ln(1/2) = -ln(2)`\n=> `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\nSquaring this gives `r2^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`.\nNow substitute the definition of `r2`:\n`(x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 + z*z = (ln(2)/10)^2`.\n\nSince we also require `y=0`, the equation becomes:\n`(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`, with the constraint `x>0`.\nThis is the equation of a closed loop in the `y=0` plane (the xz-plane). Let's call this curve `C_2`.\n\n**5. Determine the Linking Number of `C_1` and `C_2`**\n\n*   `C_1` is the circle `x^2+y^2 = 0.5` in the `z=0` plane.\n*   `C_2` is the loop `(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2` in the `y=0` plane, with `x>0`.\n\nLet's visualize the situation.\nThe plane containing `C_2` (`y=0`) is perpendicular to the plane containing `C_1` (`z=0`).\n`C_1` intersects the `y=0` plane at two points where `x^2=0.5`, i.e., `x = +/- 1/sqrt(2)`. So the points are `(1/sqrt(2), 0, 0)` and `(-1/sqrt(2), 0, 0)`.\nNow look at the loop `C_2` in the `y=0` plane. The equation is `(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = R^2` where `R=ln(2)/10`.\nLet `u = x^2`. The equation is `(u-0.5)^2 + z^2 = R^2`. This is a circle in the `(u,z)` plane centered at `(u=0.5, z=0)` with radius `R`.\nThis means the values of `x^2` for the loop `C_2` vary around `0.5`, and `z` varies around `0`.\nThe center of the loop `C_2` in the `xz` plane corresponds to `u=0.5, z=0`, which is `x^2=0.5, z=0`. Since `x>0`, this is the point `(x,z) = (1/sqrt(2), 0)`.\nSo, the loop `C_2` encircles the point `P = (1/sqrt(2), 0, 0)`.\nThis point `P` lies on the circle `C_1`.\nTherefore, the loop `C_2` is threaded through the circle `C_1`. The two curves are linked.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Linking number**\nThe linking number of two such interlocked, perpendicular closed loops is `+1` or `-1`, depending on their orientation. Since the question asks for \"the Hopf charge\", which is a single integer value, and the structure is standard, the magnitude is the key. The magnitude of the linking number is 1.\n\n**6. Alternative Method: `p-q` formula**\n\nFor axisymmetric textures of the form `n=(sin(theta(rho,z))cos(p*f), sin(theta(rho,z))sin(p*f), cos(theta(rho,z)))`, where `rho = sqrt(x^2+y^2)` and `f=atan2(y,x)`, the Hopf charge is given by `H = p * q`.\n*   `p` is the winding number of the azimuthal angle `f`. In our case, `phi = f`, so `p=1`.\n*   `q` is the winding number of the poloidal map. It represents the number of times `theta` sweeps the range `[0, PI]` along a path from the axis of symmetry (`rho=0`) to the region where `theta=PI`.\n\nLet's check `q` for our field `theta = G = PI * exp(-10 * sqrt((rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2))`.\n-   `theta=0` at infinity.\n-   `theta=PI` at the point `(rho,z) = (1/sqrt(2), 0)`.\n-   The field `theta(rho,z)` has a single peak of value `PI` in the `rho-z` half-plane and decays to `0` everywhere at the boundary (at infinity and on the `z` axis, though it's not exactly zero on the axis). This structure corresponds to a winding number `q=1`.\n\nTherefore, `H = p * q = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nBoth methods confirm the result. The parameters `PI`, `0.5`, and `-10` in the definition simply set the range, size, and sharpness of the structure but do not alter its fundamental topology, which is that of the simplest Hopfion.\n\nFinal Answer Conclusion: The linking number calculation shows the preimages of two points are two curves that are linked once. The symmetry analysis gives `p=1` and `q=1`. Both methods yield a Hopf charge of 1.\n\n>>>1"
