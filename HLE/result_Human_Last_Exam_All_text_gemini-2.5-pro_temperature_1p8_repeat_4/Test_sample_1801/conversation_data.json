    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Who?** Two Nobel laureates. This means the individuals must have won a Nobel Prize at some point in their lives.\n2.  **What?** They were featured in a commercial.\n3.  **Which commercial?** An \"infamous\" one for the company Enron.\n4.  **When?** The year was 2000.\n5.  **Key detail:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Advertising Campaign**\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major branding initiative by Enron in 2000. The goal was to re-position Enron from a simple energy company to an innovative, forward-thinking global corporation that challenged the status quo. The commercials became infamous after Enron's spectacular collapse due to massive accounting fraud in late 2001, making the ads an ironic piece of corporate history.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the First Nobel Laureate**\n*   Researching the \"Ask Why\" campaign reveals that one of the prominent figures featured was **Mikhail Gorbachev**.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must confirm he is a Nobel laureate. A quick check shows that Mikhail Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 for his leading role in the peace process which characterized important parts of the international community. Since the ad aired in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate at the time of filming.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Second Nobel Laureate**\n*   The same research points to economist **Paul Krugman** as another figure in the \"Ask Why\" campaign.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must confirm he is a Nobel laureate and address any timing issues. Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 \"for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\"\n*   **Crucial Consideration:** The commercial aired in 2000, eight years *before* he received his Nobel Prize. However, the question asks for \"Nobel laureates\" who were in the ad, not \"people who were already Nobel laureates when the ad aired.\" Therefore, Paul Krugman fits the criteria as he is, indeed, a Nobel laureate. At the time of the commercial, he was a well-respected economist and professor at Princeton University.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Finalize the Answer**\nThe two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" ad campaign were Mikhail Gorbachev and Paul Krugman. Gorbachev had already won his Nobel Peace Prize in 1990. Krugman, an influential economist at the time, would go on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.\n\n<<<Mikhail Gorbachev and Paul Krugman>>>"
