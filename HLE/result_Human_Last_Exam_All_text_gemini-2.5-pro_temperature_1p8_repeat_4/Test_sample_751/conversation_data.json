    "This problem asks us to find the observer canonical form for a given discrete-time system using the principle of duality. Specifically, we need to find the new output matrix, which we will denote as $\\hat{C}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and Duality**\n\nThe given discrete-time system is:\n$x(k+1) = Ax(k)$\n$y(k) = Cx(k)$\n\nwith matrices:\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$, $C = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe system has state dimension $n=3$ and output dimension $p=2$.\nThe principle of duality states that an observable system $(A, C)$ has a dual controllable system $(A^T, C^T)$. We can find the observer canonical form $(\\hat{A}, \\hat{C})$ for the original system by first finding the controllable canonical form $(\\hat{A}_c, \\hat{B}_c)$ for the dual system and then using the relations $\\hat{A} = \\hat{A}_c^T$ and $\\hat{C} = \\hat{B}_c^T$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Dual System**\n\nThe dual system is given by $(A_d, B_d)$, where $A_d = A^T$ and $B_d = C^T$.\n$A_d = A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$B_d = C^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe dual system is a multi-input system with two inputs. Let the columns of $B_d$ be $b_1$ and $b_2$:\n$b_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ (corresponds to the first output of the original system)\n$b_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ (corresponds to the second output of the original system)\n\n**3. Determine the Controllability of the Dual System and Find Controllability Indices**\n\nTo find the controllable canonical form, we first check the controllability of the dual system by finding the rank of its controllability matrix $W_c = [B_d | A_d B_d | A_d^2 B_d]$. We select a set of $n=3$ linearly independent vectors from the columns of $W_c$ in a specific order: $b_1, b_2, A_d b_1, A_d b_2, A_d^2 b_1, \\dots$.\n\nLet's compute the necessary vectors:\n*   $b_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n*   $b_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n*   $A_d b_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nNow, let's select 3 linearly independent vectors:\n1.  Select $v_1 = b_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. It is non-zero.\n2.  Select $v_2 = b_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. It is linearly independent of $v_1$.\n3.  Select $v_3 = A_d b_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. Let's check if it's linearly independent of $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. The determinant of the matrix formed by these three vectors is:\n    det$[v_1, v_2, v_3] = \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} = 0 - 1(1-0) + 2(0) = -1 \\neq 0$.\n    Thus, the three vectors are linearly independent, and the system is controllable.\n\nThe controllability indices $(\\mu_1, \\mu_2)$ are determined by how many vectors were selected from each input's chain.\n*   From the chain of input 1 ($b_1, A_d b_1, \\dots$): we selected 2 vectors ($b_1$ and $A_d b_1$). So, $\\mu_1 = 2$.\n*   From the chain of input 2 ($b_2, A_d b_2, \\dots$): we selected 1 vector ($b_2$). So, $\\mu_2 = 1$.\nThe controllability indices are $(2, 1)$. Note that $\\mu_1 + \\mu_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 = n$.\n\n**4. Determine the Controllable Canonical Form Matrix $\\hat{B}_c$**\n\nThe transformation to controllable canonical form is given by a state transformation $z = Px$. The new input matrix is $\\hat{B}_c = P B_d$. The transformation matrix $P$ is constructed such that $P^{-1}$ is formed by the chosen linearly independent vectors in order.\n$P^{-1} = [v_1, v_3, v_2] = [b_1, A_d b_1, b_2] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n*Careful point: The standard construction groups vectors from the same chain together, so the order is $[b_1, A_db_1, b_2]$.*\n\nThe transformed input matrix $\\hat{B}_c = P B_d = P [b_1, b_2]$ can be found without computing $P$ explicitly. From the relation $P P^{-1} = I$, we have:\n$P [b_1, A_d b_1, b_2] = [e_1, e_2, e_3]$\nwhere $e_i$ are the standard basis vectors.\nThis implies:\n*   $P b_1 = e_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ (since $b_1$ is the 1st column of $P^{-1}$)\n*   $P b_2 = e_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ (since $b_2$ is the 3rd column of $P^{-1}$)\n\nSo, the new input matrix for the controllable canonical form is:\n$\\hat{B}_c = [P b_1, P b_2] = [e_1, e_3] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**5. Find the New Output Matrix $\\hat{C}$ for the Observer Canonical Form**\n\nUsing the duality principle, the new output matrix $\\hat{C}$ for the observer canonical form of the original system is the transpose of the new input matrix $\\hat{B}_c$ of the controllable canonical form of the dual system.\n$\\hat{C} = \\hat{B}_c^T$\n$\\hat{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the new C matrix in the observer canonical form.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
