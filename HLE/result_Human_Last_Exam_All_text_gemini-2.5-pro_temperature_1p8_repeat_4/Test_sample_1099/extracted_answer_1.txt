The minimal average resources necessary for a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model to simulate the correlations of a singlet state are described by a linear trade-off between communication and PR-boxes. If $c$ is the average number of classical bits communicated and $p$ is the average number of PR-boxes used per measurement trial, the minimal resources must satisfy the equation: $c + p = 1$, for any non-negative $c$ and $p$. This includes the cases of using 1 bit of communication with 0 PR-boxes, or using 1 PR-box with 0 bits of communication.
