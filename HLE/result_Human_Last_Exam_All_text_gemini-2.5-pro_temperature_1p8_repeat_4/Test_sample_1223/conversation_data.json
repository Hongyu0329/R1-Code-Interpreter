    "This question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x \\in X$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is also indecomposable.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $Y$, the composant of a point $p \\in Y$ is the set of all points $q \\in Y$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $Y$ containing both $p$ and $q$. An indecomposable continuum is partitioned by its disjoint composants.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification and Remainder:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, $\\beta Y$ is its Stone-Cech compactification. The Stone-Cech remainder is the set $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of the space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ and its remainder\nLet $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a metric continuum, $X$ is a locally compact, separable, and metrizable space. The space $Y$ is an open subspace of $X$.\n*   $Y$ is locally compact: For any point $y \\in Y$, we can find a small open ball around it whose closure is also in $Y$ (and hence compact).\n*   $Y$ is not compact, as the point $x$ has been removed.\n*   $Y$ is separable and metrizable as it is a subspace of a separable metric space $X$.\n*   $Y$ is connected. Since $X$ is a continuum, it is connected. Removing a single point from a continuum does not necessarily disconnect it (unless it is an arc and the point is not an endpoint), and in the case of indecomposable continua, the complement of any single point is connected.\n\nThe question asks for the number of composants of the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. To answer this, we need to consider all possible types of hereditary indecomposable metric continua $X$. There are two main cases: $X$ is degenerate (a single point) or $X$ is non-degenerate.\n\n### Step 3: Case 1: $X$ is a degenerate continuum\nA continuum must be non-empty. The simplest non-empty continuum is a single point.\n*   Let $X = \\{p\\}$. This is a compact, connected, non-empty metric space, so it's a continuum.\n*   Is it indecomposable? A proper subcontinuum of $X$ is the empty set. The union of any two proper subcontinua is $\\emptyset \\cup \\emptyset = \\emptyset$, which is not equal to $X$. So, $X$ is indecomposable.\n*   Is it hereditarily indecomposable? Its subcontinua are $X$ itself and the empty set. Both are indecomposable (the empty set vacuously so). Thus, $X=\\{p\\}$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum.\n\nNow, we analyze the remainder for this case. We must choose a point $x \\in X$, so $x=p$.\n*   The space to compactify is $X \\setminus \\{x\\} = \\{p\\} \\setminus \\{p\\} = \\emptyset$.\n*   The Stone-Cech compactification of the empty set is the empty set, i.e., $\\beta(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$.\n*   The remainder is $\\beta(\\emptyset) \\setminus \\emptyset = \\emptyset$.\n*   We need to find the number of composants of the remainder, which is the empty set. A composant is an equivalence class of points. The empty set has no points, so it has 0 composants.\n\nThus, 0 is a possible value for the number of composants.\n\n### Step 4: Case 2: $X$ is a non-degenerate continuum\nNow, let $X$ be a non-degenerate (i.e., containing more than one point) hereditary indecomposable metric continuum. A classic example is the pseudo-arc.\nLet $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ be the remainder.\n\n1.  **$R$ is a metric continuum:** The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, separable, metrizable space. It can be shown that $Y$ is also rim-compact (every point has a basis of neighborhoods with compact boundaries). A standard theorem states that the Stone-Cech remainder of a locally compact, separable, metrizable space is a compactum (i.e., a compact metric space) if and only if the space is rim-compact. We also know that since $X$ is connected at the point $x$, the remainder $R$ is connected. Being a non-empty compact connected metric space, $R$ is a metric continuum.\n\n2.  **$R$ is non-degenerate and indecomposable:** A deep theorem by H. Cook (1970) states that if $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, then for any point $x \\in X$, the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a **non-degenerate indecomposable continuum**.\n\n3.  **Number of composants of $R$:** Now we need the number of composants of $R$, which we know is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum. A classical result in continuum theory, due to Kuratowski and Mazurkiewicz, states that any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., $2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants.\n\nTherefore, if $X$ is a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, the number of composants of the remainder is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nWe have found two possible values for the number of composants of the remainder, depending on the choice of the hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$:\n*   If $X$ is degenerate (a point), the number of composants is 0.\n*   If $X$ is non-degenerate, the number of composants is $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe question asks for the **maximum possible number** of composants. Comparing the two possible values, the maximum is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$, is also denoted as $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
