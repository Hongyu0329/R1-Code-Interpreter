    "This is an initial value problem featuring a first-order, non-linear, separable ordinary differential equation.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question and Identify the Method**\n*   The differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$.\n*   This can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$.\n*   The variables $x$ and $t$ can be separated, so this is a separable differential equation.\n*   The initial condition is $x(0) = -8$.\n*   The goal is to find the value of the solution at $t=1$, which is $x(1)$.\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Separation of variables**: When we divide by $x^2(t)$, we must be sure that $x(t)$ is not the zero function.\n*   **Constant solutions**: Check if $x(t) = 0$ is a solution. If we set $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The equation becomes $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is true. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant (or equilibrium) solution.\n*   **Initial condition check**: The initial condition is $x(0)=-8$. Since $-8 \\neq 0$, the particular solution we are looking for is not the constant solution $x(t)=0$. Therefore, we can safely divide by $x^2(t)$.\n*   **Integration constant**: Remember to include the constant of integration, $C$, after integrating.\n*   **Using the initial condition**: The constant $C$ must be determined using the given initial condition $x(0)=-8$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Separate the variables.**\nStart with the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nSeparate the terms involving $x$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Integrate both sides.**\nIntegrate the left side with respect to $x$ and the right side with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nPerforming the integrations:\n$$\n\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nHere, $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n**Step 3: Use the initial condition to find the constant C.**\nWe are given that $x(0) = -8$. Substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation from Step 2:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Write the particular solution.**\nSubstitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nThis is the implicit form of the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition.\n\n**Step 5: Find the value of x(1).**\nWe need to find the value of $x$ when $t=1$. We can substitute $t=1$ directly into the implicit solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nNow, simplify the right-hand side:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo combine the fractions, find a common denominator (which is 8):\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for $x(1)$:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
