    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the *maximum possible length* of a secret message. This message is encrypted using symbols from the Ching book, and its characters come from the Shu book.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Message Alphabet (the \"letters\" from Shu):**\n    *   The Shu book contains the alphabet for the message.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is that the Shu is \"written with only **120** most common Chinese characters\".\n    *   This means the alphabet for the secret message consists of 120 unique characters. To encode a character in the message, we need to be able to distinguish it from the 119 other possibilities.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Encryption Medium (the \"symbols\" from Ching):**\n    *   The Ching book is used for the encryption. It \"contains exactly **9999** symbols\". This is the total number of encoding units we have available.\n    *   The symbols are described as \"symbols of yinyang-wuxing\". We need to determine how many distinct types of symbols this description implies.\n        *   **Yinyang**: Represents 2 distinct states (yin and yang).\n        *   **Wuxing**: Also known as the Five Elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water), represents 5 distinct states.\n    *   Since a symbol is a combination of both (e.g., \"yin-water\" or \"yang-fire\"), the total number of unique symbol types is the product of the number of states: 2 (yinyang) × 5 (wuxing) = **10 distinct symbol types**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Encoding Scheme:**\n    *   We need to represent characters from a 120-item alphabet using a sequence of symbols from a 10-item alphabet.\n    *   A single symbol from the Ching can only represent one of 10 things, which is not enough to represent one of 120 characters.\n    *   Therefore, we must use a sequence (a block) of multiple Ching symbols to encode a single message character.\n    *   Let `k` be the number of Ching symbols in a block used to encode one character. The number of unique combinations we can make with `k` symbols is `10^k`.\n    *   To ensure we can represent all 120 characters, this number of combinations must be at least 120. We are looking for the smallest integer `k` that satisfies the inequality: `10^k ≥ 120`.\n        *   If `k = 1`, `10^1 = 10`. (Not enough)\n        *   If `k = 2`, `10^2 = 100`. (Not enough)\n        *   If `k = 3`, `10^3 = 1000`. (This is sufficient)\n    *   To maximize the length of the message, we must use the most efficient encoding, which means using the smallest possible block size. Thus, each character of the message requires **3 symbols** from the Ching.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:**\n    *   Total number of symbols available in the Ching = 9999.\n    *   Number of symbols required per message character = 3.\n    *   The maximum length of the message is the total number of available symbols divided by the number of symbols needed for each character.\n    *   Maximum Length = (Total Symbols) / (Symbols per Character)\n    *   Maximum Length = 9999 / 3 = **3333**.\n\n### Careful Points and Red Herrings\n\n*   **Irrelevant Computational Data:** The information about character recognition time (12 ms) and operation computation time (10 ns, 30 ns) is irrelevant to calculating the message length. This is a common distractor in such problems.\n*   **Irrelevant Book Size:** The total number of characters in the Shu (\"around 3000\") is not important. The key is the size of the unique character set (120).\n*   **The Meaning of \"Symbol\":** A crucial point is correctly interpreting what \"9999 symbols\" means. It refers to the total count of symbols in a sequence (the ciphertext length), not the number of unique types of symbols. The types of symbols are derived from \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n*   **Maximization Principle:** The question asks for the *max length*, which implies finding the most efficient encoding scheme (i.e., the smallest number of symbols per character).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe maximum length of the message is determined by the total number of encoding symbols available divided by the minimum number of symbols required to represent one character.\n\n*   Total symbols available = 9999\n*   Symbols per character = 3\n*   Max Length = 9999 / 3 = 3333\n\n<<<3333>>>"
