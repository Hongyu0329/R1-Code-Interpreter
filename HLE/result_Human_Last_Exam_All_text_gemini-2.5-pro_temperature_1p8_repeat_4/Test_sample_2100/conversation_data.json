    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue: Andrei Voznesensky and \"a joy-discovering sailor\".**\nThis tells us the man in question was the subject of a work by the famous Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. The description \"sailor\" suggests he was an explorer or traveler, while \"joy-discovering\" is a poetic and metaphorical label, suggesting he brought something new and positive to the world, perhaps through his travels or a famous romance.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"**\nThis is a direct quote. A key point is to identify its source. This line is from Voznesensky's famous poem which served as the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This immediately points to the protagonist of that work. The quote also highlights a central mystery about this person: his burial site was lost to history.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the historical figure from \"Juno and Avos\".**\nThe rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" tells the story of the real-life Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He led a pioneering Russian expedition to California in the early 19th century. His story, including his tragic romance with Concepción Argüello, fits the poetic description of a \"joy-discovering sailor\".\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third clue: \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"**\nThis is the final piece of the puzzle. It requires connecting the mystery of the grave to a specific historical event. Nikolai Rezanov died on his journey back from California and was buried in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807. Over the following century, the cemetery was destroyed, and the exact location of his grave was lost. For over 150 years, the question \"Where is your grave?\" was literal. In the late 1980s, during the period of Glasnost in the Soviet Union, there was renewed interest in this historical figure. Research and local efforts in Krasnoyarsk led to the identification of the likely area of his burial and the decision to erect a monument. This action provided a symbolic and physical \"answer\" to the long-standing question of his final resting place.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the clues and determine the final answer.**\nThe man described is Nikolai Rezanov, the protagonist of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos\".\n- He was a sailor and explorer.\n- Voznesensky wrote a famous line about his lost grave.\n- The location of his grave was culturally \"found\" and commemorated in the late 1980s.\nThe question asks for the man's last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
