The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**. This molecule is **achiral**. It lacks any stereocenters, as no carbon atom within the structure is bonded to four unique groups. The original stereocenter from the starting material was eliminated in the first reaction step, and no new stereocenters were created in the subsequent steps.
