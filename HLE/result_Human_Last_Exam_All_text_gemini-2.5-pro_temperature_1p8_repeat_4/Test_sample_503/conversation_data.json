    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category from an object A to an object B consists of a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$, and two 2-morphisms, the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$, satisfying the triangle identities.\n\nHere, we are working in the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of the category of posets, $\\mathsf{Pos}$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the 2-category $\\Delta$\n\n*   **Objects**: The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. In our case, the objects are $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n*   **1-Morphisms**: A 1-morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-Morphisms**: Since $\\Delta$ is a *locally posetal* 2-category, the hom-category $\\mathsf{Hom}([m],[n])$ is a poset. The order relation (which corresponds to the 2-morphisms) is given by the pointwise order: for two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ if and only if $f(k) \\le g(k)$ for all $k \\in [m]$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the adjunction conditions\n\nWe are looking for an adjunction from $A=[23]$ to $B=[37]$. This requires a pair of 1-morphisms:\n*   A \"left adjoint\" map $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n*   A \"right adjoint\" map $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n\nThese maps must be order-preserving, as they are 1-morphisms in $\\Delta$.\n\nThe adjunction also requires a unit and a counit.\n*   The unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ translates to the pointwise inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(k) \\le (R \\circ L)(k)$ for all $k \\in [23]$. This means $k \\le R(L(k))$ for all $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n*   The counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$ translates to the pointwise inequality $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$. This means $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nIn a locally posetal 2-category, the triangle identities are automatically satisfied. Thus, an adjunction is completely characterized by the existence of a pair of order-preserving maps $(L,R)$ satisfying these two inequalities.\n\n### Step 3: Relate adjunctions to special types of morphisms\n\nThe conditions $k \\le R(L(k))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$ are the definition of a (monotone) Galois connection between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$.\n\nIn the theory of posets (or more generally, categories), a map $L: P \\to Q$ is a left adjoint if it has a right adjoint $R: Q \\to P$. For posets that are complete lattices (like $[n]$), a map is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). Similarly, a map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\n*   **Condition for $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint:**\n    $L$ must preserve all suprema. The domain $[m]$ is a complete lattice. For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [m]$, its supremum is $\\max(S)$, and any order-preserving map preserves it ($L(\\max(S)) = \\max(L(S))$). However, we must also consider the empty set. The supremum of the empty set is the bottom element of the lattice. So, we must have $L(\\sup(\\emptyset_{\\text{in } [m]})) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset_{\\text{in } [n]})) = \\sup(\\emptyset_{\\text{in } [n]})$. This translates to $L(0) = 0$.\n    So, an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $L(0)=0$.\n\n*   **Condition for $R: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint:**\n    $R$ must preserve all infima. The domain $[n]$ is a complete lattice. The infimum of the empty set is the top element. We must have $R(\\inf(\\emptyset_{\\text{in } [n]})) = \\inf(R(\\emptyset_{\\text{in } [m]})) = \\inf(\\emptyset_{\\text{in } [m]})$. This translates to $R(n) = m$.\n    So, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if $R(n)=m$.\n\nFor an adjunction to exist from $[m]$ to $[n]$, we need a pair $(L, R)$ where $L$ is a left adjoint to $R$. This is equivalent to finding a left-adjoint morphism $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (which then uniquely determines its right adjoint $R$) or a right-adjoint morphism $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (which uniquely determines its left adjoint $L$). The number of such adjunctions is therefore the number of possible left-adjoint morphisms $L$, which is also equal to the number of possible right-adjoint morphisms $R$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of such morphisms\n\nWe need to find the number of adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. Here, $m=23$ and $n=37$.\nWe can count the number of left-adjoint morphisms $L: [23] \\to [37]$. These are the order-preserving maps that satisfy $L(0)=0$.\nA map $L$ is determined by the sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$.\nThe conditions on this sequence are:\n1.  $L(0) = 0$.\n2.  $0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $L(0)$ is fixed, we only need to count the number of possible sequences for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$. These form a non-decreasing sequence of 23 numbers, where each number is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic stars-and-bars counting problem. We are choosing a multiset of size 23 from a set of size 38 (the numbers $0, \\dots, 37$). The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{k+N-1}{k} $$\nHere, the number of items to choose is $k=23$, and the number of categories to choose from is $N=38$.\n$$ \\text{Number of maps} = \\binom{23+38-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAlternatively, we can use a different method. Consider the sequence $0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nLet $x_i = L(i+1)+i$ for $i=0, \\dots, 22$.\nThen $0 \\le x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_{22} \\le 37+22 = 59$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing 23 distinct numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 59\\}$, which has 60 elements.\nThe number of ways to do this is:\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n### Step 5: Verification (Optional)\nWe can also count the number of right-adjoint morphisms $R: [37] \\to [23]$. These are the order-preserving maps satisfying $R(37) = 23$.\nThe map is defined by the sequence $R(0), \\dots, R(37)$, where $R(37)=23$ and $0 \\le R(0) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le R(37)=23$.\nWe need to count non-decreasing sequences $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ of length 37, with values from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$.\nThis is choosing a multiset of size $k=37$ from a set of size $N=24$ (the numbers $0, \\dots, 23$).\nThe number of ways is $\\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$. The results match.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$."
