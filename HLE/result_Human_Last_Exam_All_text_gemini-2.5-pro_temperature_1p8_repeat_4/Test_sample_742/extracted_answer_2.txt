No. It is not possible to prove the existence of GÃ¶del's god-like entities using the customary mathematics of quantum mechanics. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics lacks the necessary concepts, such as "positive properties" and modal logic operators, and its core principles, like the uncertainty principle, would likely contradict the very definition of such an entity.
