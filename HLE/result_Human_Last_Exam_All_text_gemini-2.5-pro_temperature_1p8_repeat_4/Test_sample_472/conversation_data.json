    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". The meter is an Iambic Senarius.\n\n**Step 1: Syllabification and Elision**\n\nFirst, we break the line into syllables and identify any elisions.\n`et / ti / bi / be / ne / es / se / so / li / quom / si / bi / sit / ma / le`\n\nThere is one elision: the final `-e` in `bene` is elided before the initial `e-` of `esse`.\nThe line is spoken as: `et tibi ben' esse soli quom sibi sit male`.\nThe metrical syllables are: `et / ti / bi / be(n') / es / se / so / li / quom / si / bi / sit / ma / le`. This gives a total of 14 syllables. An iambic senarius line typically has 12 syllables, so the presence of 14 indicates that two resolutions (where a long syllable is replaced by two short syllables, or a single element of a foot is replaced by two syllables) must have occurred.\n\n**Step 2: Determining Syllable Quantities**\n\nNext, we determine whether each syllable is long (L) or short (S). A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or diphthong (long by nature), or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position).\n\n1.  `et`: Long. The vowel `e` is short, but the syllable is closed by the consonant 't', making it long by position. (L)\n2.  `ti-`: Short. The vowel `i` is short by nature and the syllable is open. (S)\n3.  `-bi`: Short. The vowel `i` is short by nature and the syllable is open. (S)\n4.  `be-`: Short. Part of `bene`. The vowel `e` is short by nature and the syllable is open. (S)\n5.  `es-`: Long. The elision connects `ben'` to `esse`. The syllable `es-` in `esse` is followed by two consonants ('ss'), making it long by position. (L)\n6.  `-se`: Short. The final `-e` of `esse` is short by nature and the syllable is open. (S)\n7.  `so-`: Long. From `sōlus`, the `o` is long by nature. (L)\n8.  `-li`: Short. The final `-i` of `soli` is short by nature. (S)\n9.  `quom`: Long. Archaic for `cum`. The vowel `u` (written `o`) is short, but the syllable is closed by 'm', making it long by position. (L)\n10. `si-`: Short. The vowel `i` is short by nature and the syllable is open. (S)\n11. `-bi`: Short. The vowel `i` is short by nature and the syllable is open. (S)\n12. `sit`: Long by default. The vowel `i` is short, but the syllable is closed by 't'. However, this is a classic candidate for *Iambic Shortening* (Brevis Brevians), where a sequence of `S L` becomes `S S`. The preceding syllable (`bi-` from `sibi`) is short. Therefore, the long `sit` is shortened. It scans as short. (S)\n13. `ma-`: Short. The `a` in `male` is short by nature and the syllable is open. (S)\n14. `-le`: Short. The final `e` in `male` is short. The last syllable of the line is *anceps* (can be long or short), but here it functions as a short syllable to form the final foot. (S)\n\nThis gives us the following sequence of quantities:\n`L S S S L S L S L S S S S S`\n\n**Step 3: Dividing the Line into Metrical Feet**\n\nNow we group this sequence into six iambic feet, allowing for valid substitutions.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti bi` -> `L S S`. This is a **Dactyl**, a valid substitution for an iamb in the first foot.\n*   **Foot 2:** `be(n') es(-se)` -> `S L`. The syllables are `be-` and `es-`. This is a perfect **Iamb**.\n*   **Foot 3:** `-se so(-li)` -> `S L`. The syllables are the remaining `-se` from `esse` and `so-` from `soli`. This is another perfect **Iamb**.\n*   **Foot 4:** `-li quom` -> `S L`. The syllables are the remaining `-li` from `soli` and `quom`. This is a perfect **Iamb**.\n*   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` -> `S S S`. With `sit` shortened, these three short syllables form a **Tribrach**, a valid resolution of an iamb.\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma le` -> `S S`. This is a **Pyrrhic**, a valid form for the final foot of an iambic senarius.\n\nThe scansion respects the rules of Plautine meter, including elision, resolution, and iambic shortening.\n\nFinal check of the scansion pattern: Dactyl | Iamb | Iamb | Iamb | Tribrach | Pyrrhic. This is a valid metrical pattern for an iambic senarius.\n\nL S S | S L | S L | S L | S S S | S S\n\n<<<L S S S L S L S L S S S S S>>>"
