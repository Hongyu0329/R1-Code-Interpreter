    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Identify Key Information\n*   **Board:** A standard 8x8 chessboard.\n*   **Pieces:** Bishops.\n*   **Constraint:** The bishops can only be placed on the **edge squares**.\n*   **Objective:** Place the **maximum possible number** of bishops. This implies that no bishop can attack another.\n*   **Question:** How many edge squares would **lack bishops** after placing the maximum number?\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n1.  **Edge Squares:** The edge squares are all squares in the 1st and 8th ranks, and the 'a' and 'h' files.\n2.  **Total Edge Squares:** An 8x8 board has 8 squares on each of the 4 sides. However, the 4 corner squares are counted twice. So, the total number of edge squares is (8 * 4) - 4 = 28. Alternatively, 8 (top) + 8 (bottom) + 6 (left side, no corners) + 6 (right side, no corners) = 28 squares.\n3.  **Bishop Attacks:** Bishops attack along diagonals. A crucial property is that a bishop always stays on squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack pieces on black squares.\n4.  **Strategy:** Because bishops on different colors do not interact, we can solve the problem for each color independently and then combine the results.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Part A: Calculate the number of bishops on DARK edge squares.**\n\n1.  **Count the dark edge squares:** On a standard chessboard, there are 14 dark edge squares and 14 light edge squares.\n    *   *Dark Squares:* a1, c1, e1, g1, a3, a5, a7, b8, d8, f8, h8, h2, h4, h6. (Total 14)\n2.  **Analyze the attacks:** We need to find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these 14 squares without any of them attacking each other. We can model this by seeing which squares are connected by diagonals.\n    *   The corner squares `a1` and `h8` attack each other. We can only place **1** bishop on this pair of squares.\n    *   Let's analyze the remaining 12 squares. They form three distinct groups where squares attack each other in a cycle:\n        *   **Cycle 1:** `c1` attacks `a3`, which attacks `f8`, which attacks `h6`, which in turn attacks `c1`. From this cycle of 4 squares, we can place a maximum of **2** non-attacking bishops (e.g., on c1 and f8).\n        *   **Cycle 2:** `e1` attacks `a5`, which attacks `d8`, which attacks `h4`, which attacks `e1`. From this cycle of 4 squares, we can place a maximum of **2** bishops.\n        *   **Cycle 3:** `g1` attacks `a7`, which attacks `b8`, which attacks `h2`, which attacks `g1`. From this cycle of 4 squares, we can place a maximum of **2** bishops.\n3.  **Sum the results for dark squares:**\n    *   From the (a1, h8) pair: 1 bishop.\n    *   From Cycle 1: 2 bishops.\n    *   From Cycle 2: 2 bishops.\n    *   From Cycle 3: 2 bishops.\n    *   Total maximum bishops on dark edge squares = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **7**.\n\n**Part B: Calculate the number of bishops on LIGHT edge squares.**\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The pattern of connections for the 14 light edge squares is identical to that of the dark squares due to the board's rotational symmetry.\n2.  **Count the light edge squares:** There are 14 light edge squares.\n    *   *Light Squares:* b1, d1, f1, h1, a2, a4, a6, a8, c8, e8, g8, h3, h5, h7. (Total 14)\n3.  **Analyze attacks (confirming by symmetry):**\n    *   The corner squares `h1` and `a8` attack each other. We can place **1** bishop.\n    *   The remaining 12 squares form three 4-cycles, just like the dark squares. Each cycle allows for a maximum of **2** bishops.\n4.  **Sum the results for light squares:**\n    *   Total maximum bishops on light edge squares = 1 + (3 * 2) = **7**.\n\n**Part C: Calculate the final answer.**\n\n1.  **Total Maximum Bishops:** The placements on dark and light squares are independent.\n    *   Total Bishops = (Bishops on Dark) + (Bishops on Light) = 7 + 7 = **14**.\n2.  **Empty Edge Squares:** The question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops.\n    *   Total Edge Squares = 28.\n    *   Edge Squares with Bishops = 14.\n    *   Empty Edge Squares = Total Edge Squares - Edge Squares with Bishops\n    *   Empty Edge Squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIf they succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, they would place a total of 14 bishops. Since there are 28 edge squares in total, the number of squares lacking bishops would be 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
