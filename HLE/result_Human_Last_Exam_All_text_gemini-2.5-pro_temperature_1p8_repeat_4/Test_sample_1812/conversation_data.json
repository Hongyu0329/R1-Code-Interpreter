    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **The Core Task:** The question asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix A.\n2.  **The Matrix:** The matrix is given as:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & -1 & 2 \n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n3.  **Contextual Clue:** The phrase \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides the origin of this matrix. While this background is not necessary for the calculation, it can be a useful check. This matrix is the Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\). A key property of all affine Cartan matrices is that their determinant is zero.\n4.  **Matrix Properties:**\n    *   The matrix is symmetric, meaning \\(A = A^T\\).\n    *   The diagonal elements are all equal to 2.\n    *   The off-diagonal elements are all equal to -1.\n    *   A critical property to notice is that the sum of the elements in each row is zero (e.g., for the first row: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)). The same is true for the columns.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nWe can use several methods to find the determinant.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Calculation using the Cofactor Expansion**\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\) is calculated as \\(a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\\).\n\nApplying this formula to matrix A:\n*   `a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n*   `d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n*   `g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n\\[ \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the determinants of the 2x2 matrices:\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the main formula:\n\\[ \\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3) \\]\n\\[ \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\]\n\\[ \\det(A) = 0 \\]\n\n**Method 2: Using Properties of Determinants**\nThis is a more elegant and faster method if you observe the matrix properties.\n\n*   A fundamental property of determinants states that if the sum of the rows (or columns) results in a zero vector, the rows (or columns) are linearly dependent, and the determinant of the matrix is 0.\n*   Let's sum the rows of matrix A:\n    *   Row 1 + Row 2 + Row 3 = \\( [2, -1, -1] + [-1, 2, -1] + [-1, -1, 2] \\)\n    *   = \\( [2-1-1, -1+2-1, -1-1+2] \\)\n    *   = \\( [0, 0, 0] \\)\n*   Since the sum of the row vectors is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent.\n*   Therefore, the determinant of A must be 0.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
