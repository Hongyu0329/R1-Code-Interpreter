    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the very first law (statute) passed by the Knesset (the parliament of the modern State of Israel, established in 1948) that specifically and explicitly used the term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*).\n\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis & Common Misconception:** Many legal professionals and students would immediately point to the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 5733-1973**. This is because this law famously established \"good faith\" as a fundamental, overarching principle governing all contracts, both in pre-contractual negotiations (Section 12) and in the performance of contractual obligations (Section 39). Its impact on Israeli law was revolutionary, elevating the concept to a \"super-principle.\"\n\n3.  **The \"First Statute\" Requirement:** The question, however, asks for the *first* statute, not necessarily the most famous or the one with the broadest application. This requires looking at legislation enacted *before* 1973 to see if the term appeared earlier in a more specific context.\n\n4.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Statutes:** We must examine the new civil legislation enacted by the Knesset in the 1960s as Israel began to replace the inherited Ottoman and British Mandate laws with its own original codifications.\n\n    *   **Agency Law, 5725-1965:** This law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent, which is a related but distinct concept from \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). It does not use the explicit term \"good faith.\"\n    *   **Bailees Law, 5727-1967:** This law governs the rights and obligations of bailees (those who hold property for others). We need to check its text. Section 8(a) of the Bailees Law states: \"Where a bailee acted in **good faith** (*be-tom lev*) under directions from the depositor, he is discharged from his liability to the owner of the property.\" This is a clear and explicit statutory use of the term \"good faith.\"\n\n5.  **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   The **Bailees Law** was enacted in **1967**. It contains the explicit phrase \"in good faith.\"\n    *   The **Contracts (General Part) Law** was enacted in **1973**. It also contains the explicit phrase but came later.\n\n    Therefore, while the Contracts (General Part) Law gave the principle of good faith its broad and central role in Israeli civil law, the Bailees Law was the first statute enacted in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept into its legislative text.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question specifically asks for a statute that *explicitly introduced* the concept. The concept may have existed implicitly in case law inherited from the British Mandate (under the doctrine of equity), but the focus here is on its first appearance in an original Israeli statute.\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Most Important\":** It's crucial not to confuse the first mention with the most significant application. The Contracts Law of 1973 is far more significant for the development of the \"good faith\" doctrine, but the Bailees Law of 1967 was chronologically first.\n*   **Hebrew Terminology:** The Hebrew term for \"good faith\" is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). Its presence is the key identifier in the original legislative texts.\n*   **Answer Formatting:** The instructions state not to include \"the\" or the statute's year in the final answer.\n\nThe first statute to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Bailees Law of 1967.\n\n<<<Bailees Law>>>"
