    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The central clue is the reference to \"Veronika Campan's interpretation\". A search for this author reveals that she has written about the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue), particularly in her book \"Die Zehn Gebote: Eine Gebrauchsanweisung für das Leben\" (\"The Ten Commandments: A User's Manual for Life\"). This immediately suggests the question is related to the Ten Commandments.\n\n2.  **Identify \"HE\" and \"HIS work\":** If the subject is the Ten Commandments, \"HIS work\" refers to this set of laws. According to Abrahamic religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), the person who received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai and delivered them to the people was Moses. Therefore, \"HE\" is Moses.\n\n3.  **Analyze \"at the end of HIS work\":** The Ten Commandments are a numbered list. \"At the end\" would refer to the last commandment or commandments. In most traditions, the final commandments are the Ninth and Tenth, which deal with the prohibition of coveting.\n\n4.  **Analyze \"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\":** The final commandment(s) specifically list items one should not covet. For example, Exodus 20:17 states: \"You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.\" Here, the neighbor's \"house\" and other material possessions (\"ox,\" \"donkey\") are addressed distinctly.\n\n5.  **Analyze \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\":** This is the most complex clue and the key to the interpretation.\n    *   The \"prohibition against representation\" clearly refers to the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.\" This is a ban on making physical idols or images for worship.\n    *   The act of \"coveting,\" which is forbidden in the final commandment, is an internal, mental act. To covet your neighbor's house or ox, you must first form a mental *image* or *representation* of that house or ox.\n    *   Therefore, Veronika Campan's interpretation posits that the final commandment, by forbidding a purely mental act that requires imagination, \"naturally ignores\" the absolute terms of the Second Commandment. The ban is on physical idols for worship, not on the mind's natural ability to form representations, an ability which is inherent to the very concept of desire or covetousness.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   The validity of the interpretation is attributed to Veronika Campan, so we are solving for her specific viewpoint, not a universal theological consensus.\n*   The subject \"HE\" is the human figure associated with delivering the work, not its ultimate author (God, in the religious tradition).\n*   The question asks for the \"full name\". In historical and common usage, \"Moses\" is the complete and standard name for this figure, as he does not have a surname in the modern sense.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy piecing together the clues, we can identify \"HIS work\" as the Ten Commandments. The end of the work is the prohibition against coveting. This prohibition addresses material possessions and implicitly relies on mental representation, which seemingly contrasts with the earlier prohibition against physical representation. The historical and religious figure who delivered the Ten Commandments is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
