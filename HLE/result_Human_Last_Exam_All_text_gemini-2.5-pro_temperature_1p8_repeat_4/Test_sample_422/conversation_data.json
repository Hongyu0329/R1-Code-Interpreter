    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, identifying the careful points and deriving the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and its Premises\n\nFirst, let's break down the core components of the prompt to ensure we understand the rules of the puzzle.\n\n*   **Core Definition:** We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of Knowledge. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true (T).\n    2.  S believes that P (B).\n    3.  S is justified in believing that P (J).\n    *   Symbolically: K = J + T + B.\n\n*   **Primary Constraint:** There are only two possible epistemic states: **Knowledge (K)** and **Belief (B)**. This is a crucial and artificial constraint. It means any mental state regarding a proposition must be classified as either K or B, with no other options. This implies that states like \"justified belief,\" \"unjustified belief,\" \"true belief,\" or \"false belief\" do not exist as independent categories. If a state isn't Knowledge, it must be Belief.\n\n*   **Secondary Constraint:** We must **ignore Gettier problems**. Gettier problems demonstrate that JTB is insufficient for knowledge because one can have a justified true belief by luck. By ignoring them, we are asked to focus on other structural or conceptual issues with the JTB account under the primary constraint.\n\n*   **Goal:** Identify **two distinct problems** that arise for the JTB definition under these specific conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the First Problem - The Compositional Fallacy / Circularity\n\nThis problem arises from the relationship between the *definition* of Knowledge and the *available states*.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The JTB theory defines Knowledge (K) as being composed of several parts, including a \"Justified Belief\". A Justified Belief is the combination of the 'J' and 'B' conditions.\n*   **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n    1.  According to JTB, to determine if someone is in the state of Knowledge (K), we must first verify if they have a \"Justified Belief\".\n    2.  However, the prompt's primary constraint states that \"Justified Belief\" is *not* an available epistemic state. A person can only be in a state of \"Knowledge\" or a state of \"Belief\".\n    3.  This creates a paradox. The definition of the state \"Knowledge\" requires a component (\"Justified Belief\") that cannot exist as a state itself.\n    4.  It is like defining a \"house\" as a \"foundation\" plus \"walls,\" but then stating that the only objects that can exist in the world are \"houses\" and \"tents.\" You can't build the house because the necessary component, \"foundation,\" is not a permissible object to have on its own.\n    5.  Therefore, the JTB definition becomes inoperable or circular within this system. It defines one of the only two possible states (Knowledge) using a concept (Justified Belief) that is not itself a possible state.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Second Problem - The Collapse of Epistemic Distinction\n\nThis problem arises when we consider beliefs that fail to meet the standard of Knowledge.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The primary constraint forces any epistemic state that is *not* Knowledge to be classified as \"Belief\". This makes \"Belief\" a catch-all category for all non-knowledge states.\n*   **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n    1.  Consider a **justified but false belief** (JFB). For example, for centuries, the best astronomers were justified in believing the Ptolemaic model of the solar system, but the belief was false.\n    2.  According to the JTB definition, this JFB is *not* Knowledge because it fails the truth (T) condition.\n    3.  Because it is not Knowledge, and the only other available state is \"Belief\", this JFB must be categorized simply as a **Belief**.\n    4.  Now, consider an **unjustified belief** (whether true or false). For example, a belief that a particular horse will win a race based on a baseless hunch.\n    5.  This unjustified belief is also *not* Knowledge because it fails the justification (J) condition.\n    6.  Therefore, this unjustified belief must also be categorized as a **Belief**.\n    7.  The problem is now clear: The system lumps epistemically respectable states (justified but false beliefs) into the exact same category as epistemically irresponsible states (unjustified beliefs). The crucial distinction that the \"Justification\" condition is supposed to provide is lost for any belief that doesn't also happen to be true. It erases the value of being justified unless you also win the \"truth lottery.\"\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the two problems for the JTB theory under these specific constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Unavailable Intermediate States (Circularity):** The JTB definition of Knowledge requires a \"Justified Belief\" as a necessary component. However, the system's rules forbid \"Justified Belief\" from existing as an independent epistemic state, making the definition of Knowledge internally inconsistent or impossible to construct from its required parts.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Collapsed Distinctions:** By forcing all non-knowledge states into the single category of \"Belief,\" the system loses the ability to distinguish between a justified false belief and an unjustified belief. This undermines the epistemic importance of justification, as it only \"counts\" when a belief is also true.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems that the JTB theory runs into under these constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Unavailable Components (Circularity):** The JTB definition requires a \"Justified Belief\" as a necessary building block for Knowledge. However, the premise that the only available epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" means that \"Justified Belief\" cannot exist as an independent state. This creates a circular or compositional problem: you cannot define or construct the state of Knowledge from a component that is not allowed to exist in the system.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Collapsing Epistemic Distinctions:** Since any state that is not Knowledge must be classified as \"Belief,\" the system cannot differentiate between a justified but false belief and an unjustified belief. Both a scientifically reasoned but incorrect conclusion and a belief based on a whim would be categorized simply as \"Belief.\" This undermines the role of justification, as it erases the crucial epistemic distinction between a rationally held falsehood and an irrational one.\n>>>"
