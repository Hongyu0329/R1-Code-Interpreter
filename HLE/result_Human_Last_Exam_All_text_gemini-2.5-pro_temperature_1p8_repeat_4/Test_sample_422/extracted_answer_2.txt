The two problems that the JTB theory runs into under these constraints are:

1.  **The Problem of Unavailable Components (Circularity):** The JTB definition requires a "Justified Belief" as a necessary building block for Knowledge. However, the premise that the only available epistemic states are "Knowledge" and "Belief" means that "Justified Belief" cannot exist as an independent state. This creates a circular or compositional problem: you cannot define or construct the state of Knowledge from a component that is not allowed to exist in the system.

2.  **The Problem of Collapsing Epistemic Distinctions:** Since any state that is not Knowledge must be classified as "Belief," the system cannot differentiate between a justified but false belief and an unjustified belief. Both a scientifically reasoned but incorrect conclusion and a belief based on a whim would be categorized simply as "Belief." This undermines the role of justification, as it erases the crucial epistemic distinction between a rationally held falsehood and an irrational one.
