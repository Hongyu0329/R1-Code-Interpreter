    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a theory in population ethics used to evaluate the goodness of different populations. According to a standard critical-level view, the value of a population is calculated by summing up the \"utility minus a critical level\" for every person in that population.\n\n*   **Formula:** Value = Σ(uᵢ - c)\n    *   uᵢ is the utility (well-being) of person *i*.\n    *   c is the \"critical level,\" a positive constant (c > 0).\n\nA key implication of this view is that adding a new person to the world is only a positive change if their utility is above the critical level (*u > c*). If their utility is positive but below the critical level (*0 < u < c*), adding them actually makes the world a worse place, as the term (u - c) will be negative.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's impossibility theorems demonstrate that it's impossible for a single theory of population ethics to satisfy a set of conditions that, on their own, seem very reasonable. The sixth theorem specifically shows that the following conditions are mutually inconsistent:\n\n1.  **Welfarism & Ordering:** The evaluation of populations depends only on the welfare of individuals, and populations can be ordered from best to worst.\n2.  **Weak Quality Addition (WQA):** There is at least some situation where adding a person with a high quality of life makes the world better.\n3.  **Non-Elitism:** A world with a very large number of people suffering terribly cannot be considered good, no matter how many extremely happy \"elite\" people also exist.\n4.  **Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle is about preferring a larger, more equal population to a smaller, less equal one. Specifically, for any positive utility level *u*, a population of two people who are both at a slightly lower level (*u - ε*) is better than a population of one person at level *u*.\n\nSince these conditions are logically inconsistent, any coherent ethical theory (like the critical-level view) must violate at least one of them. The question asks which one is violated by critical-level views.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Critical-Level Views Against Each Condition\n\nLet's test the critical-level view against the conditions listed in the answer choices. We'll assume a critical level *c > 0*.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** Does a critical-level view satisfy this? Yes. It states that *sometimes* adding a happy person is good. According to the critical-level view, adding a person with utility *u > c* increases the total value. As long as we don't rule out the possibility of such happy lives, this condition is met.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** Does a critical-level view satisfy this? Yes. This principle, in its common form, states that a world with happy people is better than a world with the same number of suffering people. Let's compare a population of *n* people with positive utility *u > 0* to one with *n* people with negative utility *v < 0*.\n    *   Value of happy world: n * (u - c)\n    *   Value of suffering world: n * (v - c)\n    *   Since *u > v*, it is always true that n*(u-c) > n*(v-c). So the happy world is always judged to be better than the suffering one. The condition is met.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** Does a critical-level view satisfy this? Yes. According to the critical-level view, adding a person with negative welfare (*v < 0*) always adds a negative value to the total sum (*v - c*). If you add a sufficiently large number of such people, their combined negative value will overwhelm any amount of positive value from a group of happy elites. The condition is met.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** Does a critical-level view satisfy this? No. This is a prioritarian principle, meaning it gives extra weight to improvements for those who are worse off. A simple way to see this is that a transfer of utility from a richer person to a poorer person should make the world strictly better. In a standard additive critical-level view, Value = Σ(uᵢ - c), the sum of utilities remains the same after such a transfer, so the total value is unchanged. The theory is utilitarian-like, not prioritarian. Therefore, it violates this condition.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** Does a critical-level view satisfy this? No. This is the crucial condition for the sixth theorem. The condition states that for *any* positive utility level *u*, a two-person world at level *u-ε* is better than a one-person world at level *u*. Let's test this with the critical-level formula.\n    *   Value of one person at *u*: V₁ = u - c\n    *   Value of two people at *u-ε*: V₂ = 2 * ((u - ε) - c) = 2u - 2ε - 2c\n    *   The condition requires V₂ > V₁. Is it true that 2u - 2ε - 2c > u - c?\n    *   This simplifies to: **u - c > 2ε**\n    *   This inequality is *not* always true. It depends on the value of *u*. For example, if the utility level *u* is below the critical level *c* (so *u-c* is negative), the inequality is false. If *u=5*, *c=10*, and *ε=1*, the inequality becomes 5 - 10 > 2(1), which is -5 > 2. This is false.\n    *   Since the Egalitarian Dominance principle is supposed to hold for *any* positive utility level *u*, and the critical-level view fails this test, the critical-level view **violates Egalitarian Dominance**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBoth General Non-Extreme Priority and Egalitarian Dominance are violated by standard critical-level views. However, the question specifically refers to Arrhenius's **sixth** impossibility theorem. The defining axioms of that particular theorem are WQA, Non-Elitism, and **Egalitarian Dominance**. Since critical-level views are a consistent theory, they must violate one of these axioms to escape the impossibility result. As demonstrated above, the axiom they violate is Egalitarian Dominance.\n\n<<<A>>>"
