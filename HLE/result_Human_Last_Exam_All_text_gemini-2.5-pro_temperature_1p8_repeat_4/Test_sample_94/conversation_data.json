    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** Let's break down the key phrases in the question to identify the required information.\n    *   \"...physicist...\" — The person is a scientist in the field of physics.\n    *   \"...better known for work in the microscopy field...\" — Their primary contribution or fame is related to microscopes or microscopic imaging techniques.\n    *   \"...discovered an optical effect in real imagery...\" — The discovery relates to optics and the formation of real images (where light rays actually converge), typically formed by concave mirrors or converging lenses.\n    *   \"...after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\" — This is the most specific and unique clue. It points to a particular anecdote about the discovery involving a concave mirror, dust or cleaning, and an accidental observation by a non-scientist.\n\n2.  **Identify the Optical Effect:** The story of seeing normally invisible things like heat waves or small disturbances in the air when looking at or near a large concave mirror is the classic description of the **Schlieren effect**. This optical phenomenon visualizes differences in the refractive index of a transparent medium. The custodial worker cleaning the mirror would have disturbed the air, creating dust plumes and air currents (heat from their hand, etc.) that would become visible.\n\n3.  **Identify the Physicist:** The physicist credited with the invention of the technique to visualize these phenomena is **August Toepler**. In 1864, he developed what is now known as the Toepler's Schlieren method. While Léon Foucault had earlier developed a similar setup (the Foucault knife-edge test) to check the quality of mirrors, Toepler was the one who realized its potential for visualizing flow and other transparent disturbances.\n\n4.  **Connect to Microscopy:** Schlieren imaging is a specialized technique used to visualize \"phase objects\" — objects that are transparent and do not absorb light, but merely alter its phase (e.g., density gradients in air, shockwaves, gas leaks). This is a fundamental principle shared with other advanced microscopy techniques like Phase-Contrast microscopy and Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy. Therefore, Toepler's work is considered a significant contribution to the broader field of scientific imaging and microscopy.\n\n5.  **Verify the Anecdote:** The story of a janitor or cleaning person noticing strange \"shadows\" or \"wavy lines\" in the air while cleaning a concave mirror is a piece of scientific folklore strongly associated with the Schlieren effect's discovery or demonstration. This accidental observation of heat waves or dust plumes is precisely what the Schlieren method is designed to capture, lending credence to the anecdote's connection with Toepler.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy combining the clues, we can determine that the physicist is August Toepler, who developed the Schlieren imaging technique. This technique is a form of contrast microscopy, it relies on real imagery formed by a concave mirror, and its discovery is popularly linked to an anecdote involving accidental observation of air disturbances around a mirror.\n\n<<<August Toepler>>>"
