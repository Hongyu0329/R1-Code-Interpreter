At sunrise, when exposed to sunlight, the table must change its shape from an elongated, straight form (representing the stable *trans*-isomer) to a bent, more compact form (representing the less stable *cis*-isomer). At sunset, in the darkness, it must spontaneously and gradually revert back from the bent shape to the elongated shape, mimicking the thermal relaxation of the *cis*-isomer back to the stable *trans*-isomer.
