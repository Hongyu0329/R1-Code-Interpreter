    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\nA queen at position `(r, c)` on a toroidal board attacks all cells in:\n1.  The same row `r`.\n2.  The same column `c`.\n3.  The same \"sum-diagonals\", where all cells `(r', c')` have the same value for `r' + c' (mod 5)`.\n4.  The same \"difference-diagonals\", where all cells `(r', c')` have the same value for `r' - c' (mod 5)`.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 queens such that no two queens attack each other. Let the positions of the four queens be $(r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), (r_3, c_3), (r_4, c_4)$. The conditions for a non-attacking placement are:\n\n*   The set of row indices $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$ must contain 4 distinct values.\n*   The set of column indices $\\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$ must contain 4 distinct values.\n*   The set of sum-diagonal indices $\\{r_1+c_1, r_2+c_2, r_3+c_3, r_4+c_4\\}$ (mod 5) must contain 4 distinct values.\n*   The set of difference-diagonal indices $\\{r_1-c_1, r_2-c_2, r_3-c_3, r_4-c_4\\}$ (mod 5) must contain 4 distinct values.\n\nSince the board is 5x5, each of these sets of indices will be a subset of $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ of size 4.\n\n### Step 2: A Combinatorial Reformulation\nA placement of 4 queens means we choose 4 rows out of 5, 4 columns out of 5, 4 sum-diagonals out of 5, and 4 difference-diagonals out of 5.\nFor any valid placement of 4 queens, there will be exactly one unused row ($r_{miss}$), one unused column ($c_{miss}$), one unused sum-diagonal ($s_{miss}$), and one unused difference-diagonal ($d_{miss}$).\n\nLet's find the relationship between these missing indices. The sum of all row indices is $0+1+2+3+4 = 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$.\nThe sum of the four used row indices is $\\sum r_i = (\\sum_{k=0}^4 k) - r_{miss} \\equiv -r_{miss} \\pmod 5$.\nSimilarly, $\\sum c_i \\equiv -c_{miss}$, $\\sum (r_i+c_i) \\equiv -s_{miss}$, and $\\sum (r_i-c_i) \\equiv -d_{miss}$.\n\nFrom these, we can derive dependencies:\n$\\sum (r_i+c_i) = \\sum r_i + \\sum c_i \\implies -s_{miss} \\equiv (-r_{miss}) + (-c_{miss}) \\pmod 5 \\implies s_{miss} \\equiv r_{miss} + c_{miss} \\pmod 5$.\n$\\sum (r_i-c_i) = \\sum r_i - \\sum c_i \\implies -d_{miss} \\equiv (-r_{miss}) - (-c_{miss}) \\pmod 5 \\implies d_{miss} \\equiv r_{miss} - c_{miss} \\pmod 5$.\n\nThis means that if we choose the missing row ($r_{miss}$) and the missing column ($c_{miss}$), the other two missing diagonal indices are automatically determined.\n\n### Step 3: Using Symmetry to Simplify the Problem\nThere are 5 choices for $r_{miss}$ and 5 choices for $c_{miss}$, making $5 \\times 5 = 25$ pairs of $(r_{miss}, c_{miss})$. Let's count the number of valid queen placements for each pair.\n\nThe toroidal board has translational symmetry. We can shift the board by any vector $(a, b)$ without changing the attack patterns. A shift operation `(r, c) -> (r-a, c-b) mod 5` transforms a solution with missing indices $(r_{miss}, c_{miss}) = (a, b)$ into a solution with missing indices $(0, 0)$. This transformation is a bijection. Therefore, the number of solutions is the same for every pair of $(r_{miss}, c_{miss})$.\n\nWe can calculate the number of solutions for a single case, say $(r_{miss}, c_{miss}) = (0, 0)$, and then multiply it by 25.\nFor $(r_{miss}, c_{miss}) = (0, 0)$:\n$s_{miss} \\equiv 0+0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$.\n$d_{miss} \\equiv 0-0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$.\n\nThis means we need to find placements where the used rows, columns, sum-diagonals, and difference-diagonals are all from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Solutions for the Simplified Case\nWe are placing 4 queens on the 4x4 sub-grid defined by rows $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and columns $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. Let the placement be described by a permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, where the queen in row `i` is in column `σ(i)`. The positions are `(i, σ(i))` for `i` in `{1,2,3,4}`.\n\nThe conditions are:\n1.  The set of column indices $\\{\\sigma(1), \\sigma(2), \\sigma(3), \\sigma(4)\\}$ is $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. (This is guaranteed by the definition of a permutation).\n2.  The set of sum-diagonals $\\{1+\\sigma(1), 2+\\sigma(2), 3+\\sigma(3), 4+\\sigma(4)\\} \\pmod 5$ must be $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n3.  The set of difference-diagonals $\\{1-\\sigma(1), 2-\\sigma(2), 3-\\sigma(3), 4-\\sigma(4)\\} \\pmod 5$ must be $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n\nLet's test all 24 permutations of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. We can pre-filter them. For the sum and difference values to be in $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, they cannot be $0 \\pmod 5$.\n$i + \\sigma(i) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 5 \\implies \\sigma(i) \\ne 5-i$.\n$i - \\sigma(i) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 5 \\implies \\sigma(i) \\ne i$.\n\nThe condition $\\sigma(i) \\ne i$ means the permutation must be a derangement. There are 9 derangements of 4 elements.\nThe condition $\\sigma(i) \\ne 5-i$ provides further constraints:\n$\\sigma(1)\\ne 4$, $\\sigma(2)\\ne 3$, $\\sigma(3)\\ne 2$, $\\sigma(4)\\ne 1$.\n\nLet's check the derangements that satisfy this second condition. The 4 permutations that satisfy both are:\n*   (2, 1, 4, 3)\n*   (2, 4, 1, 3)\n*   (3, 1, 4, 2)\n*   (3, 4, 1, 2)\n\nNow we test the full conditions (distinct sum and difference diagonals) on these 4 candidates:\n1.  **σ = (2, 1, 4, 3)**\n    *   i: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n    *   σ(i): (2, 1, 4, 3)\n    *   i+σ(i) mod 5: (3, 3, 2, 2). Not distinct. **FAIL.**\n2.  **σ = (2, 4, 1, 3)**\n    *   i: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n    *   σ(i): (2, 4, 1, 3)\n    *   i+σ(i) mod 5: (3, 1, 4, 2). Is {1,2,3,4}. **OK.**\n    *   i-σ(i) mod 5: (4, 3, 2, 1). Is {1,2,3,4}. **OK.**\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n3.  **σ = (3, 1, 4, 2)**\n    *   i: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n    *   σ(i): (3, 1, 4, 2)\n    *   i+σ(i) mod 5: (4, 3, 2, 1). Is {1,2,3,4}. **OK.**\n    *   i-σ(i) mod 5: (3, 1, 4, 2). Is {1,2,3,4}. **OK.**\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n4.  **σ = (3, 4, 1, 2)**\n    *   i: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n    *   σ(i): (3, 4, 1, 2)\n    *   i+σ(i) mod 5: (4, 1, 4, 1). Not distinct. **FAIL.**\n\nSo, for the case where $(r_{miss}, c_{miss}) = (0, 0)$, there are exactly 2 valid placements.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe number of ways for the specific case $(r_{miss}, c_{miss}) = (0,0)$ is 2.\nDue to symmetry, this number is the same for all 25 possible choices of $(r_{miss}, c_{miss})$.\nTotal number of ways = (Number of choices for $(r_{miss}, c_{miss})$) × (Number of solutions per choice)\nTotal number of ways = $25 \\times 2 = 50$."
