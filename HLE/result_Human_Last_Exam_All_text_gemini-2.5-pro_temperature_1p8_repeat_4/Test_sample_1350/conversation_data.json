    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct character.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character in William Morris's novel *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must meet three criteria:\n1.  They visited a Roman city.\n2.  They describe the religious practices they witnessed there.\n3.  Their description clearly alludes to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus (who were famously suckled by a she-wolf).\n\n**Step 2: Review the key characters and their backstories.**\n*   **Thiodolf:** The war-leader of the Wolfings. His primary interactions with the Romans are as a military commander fighting against them. While he is wise, his knowledge of Rome comes from conflict, not from a past visit as a tourist or captive observer.\n*   **Hall-Sun:** A supernatural being (a swan-maiden/valkyrie) and Thiodolf's daughter. Her world and experiences are primarily in the realm of the divine and the wild, not in Roman cities.\n*   **The Wood-Sun:** A mortal foundling and foster-sister to Hall-Sun. Her origins are mysterious, but she is raised entirely among the Wolfings and shows no personal knowledge of Roman cities.\n*   **Otter:** A thrall (a person in bondage, a slave) of the House of the Wolfings. His backstory is that he was captured from another tribe as a boy and spent time among the Romans before eventually coming to live with the Wolfings. This background makes him the most likely candidate to have firsthand experience with Roman life and religion.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the specific passage in the book.**\nIn Chapter VI, titled \"Otter tells a Tale,\" the character Otter is recounting stories from his past to the children of the house. This chapter focuses entirely on his experiences before he came to the Wolfings.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Otter's story for the required details.**\n*   **Visit to a Roman City:** Otter explicitly states that during his youth as a captive, he was taken to \"a great city of the Romans.\" This satisfies the first criterion.\n*   **Description of Religious Practices:** He describes being taken into a temple of \"the God of the City-dwellers.\" Inside, he describes what he saw. This satisfies the second criterion.\n*   **Allusion to Romulus and Remus:** Otter gives a detailed description of an image or statue he saw in the temple: **\"...a she-wolf giving suck to two babies...\"** He then recounts the story he was told by the Romans about this image: that the babies were the children of the War-God (Mars) and that they grew up to build \"the first city of their folk\" (Rome). This is an unmistakable reference to the foundation myth of Rome, featuring Romulus and Remus, the sons of Mars, who were abandoned and then found and suckled by a she-wolf. This satisfies the third criterion.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nThe character of Otter is the only one whose backstory and narrated experiences in the novel align perfectly with all parts of the question. He is a former captive who visited a Roman city and describes seeing a representation of the Romulus and Remus myth in a temple.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
