The edges of the image will become progressively smoother as the iterative process rounds off sharp corners and flattens jagged boundaries. This occurs because the boundary motion is proportional to its local curvature, a process known as mean curvature flow. Consequently, any convex shapes or features (outward bulges) will shrink, while concave features (inward dents) will fill in. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, any closed shape of one color surrounded by the other will shrink until it disappears completely. The ultimate result is an image with simplified geometry, where only large regions with straight or minimal-curvature boundaries remain, or the image becomes entirely one color.
