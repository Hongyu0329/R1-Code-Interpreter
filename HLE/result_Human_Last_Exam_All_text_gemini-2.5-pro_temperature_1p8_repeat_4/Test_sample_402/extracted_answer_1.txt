**Strategy: Isolate and Remove Contaminant Genes Prior to Primary Analysis**

**Step 1: Perform a "Contaminant-Finder" Differential Expression (DE) Analysis**
*   **Objective:** Generate a high-confidence list of genes specific to the contaminating cancer cells.
*   **Comparison Groups:**
    *   **Contaminant Profile:** RNA-seq data from the cancer cell line used in the co-culture, grown in monoculture.
    *   **Clean T Cell Profile:** RNA-seq data from your four CAR-IL15 T cell samples, which are presumed to be uncontaminated.
*   **Action:** Run a DE analysis (e.g., using a command-line script for DESeq2) comparing the Contaminant Profile vs. the Clean T Cell Profile.

**Step 2: Generate the Contamination Filter List using Log2 Fold Change**
*   **Objective:** Create a list of gene IDs to be removed from the main analysis.
*   **Action:** Filter the results from Step 1 using stringent thresholds to isolate genes almost exclusively expressed in cancer cells.
    *   **Filter Criteria:**
        1.  **`log2FoldChange > 5`** (at least 32-fold higher expression in cancer cells).
        2.  **`padj < 0.01`** (high statistical confidence).
    *   Extract the gene IDs that meet these criteria into a plain text file named `contaminant_genes.txt`.

**Step 3: Filter the Master Count Matrix**
*   **Objective:** Remove the contaminating genes from your primary dataset before normalization and analysis.
*   **Inputs:**
    1.  `master_counts.tsv`: The raw gene count matrix containing all 8 of your experimental samples (4 CAR-only, 4 CAR-IL15).
    2.  `contaminant_genes.txt`: The filter list generated in Step 2.
*   **Action**
