    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number of edges $e$ for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the automorphism group\n\nThe automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ is the group of permutations of the vertices of $\\gamma$ that preserve adjacency. We are given that $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\nA group of order 3 is always cyclic, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. Let this group be $G = \\{\\mathrm{id}, \\phi, \\phi^2\\}$, where $\\phi$ is a non-identity automorphism such that $\\phi^3 = \\mathrm{id}$.\n\nThe automorphism group $G$ acts on the set of vertices $V(\\gamma)$. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the size of any vertex orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. So, the vertices of $\\gamma$ are partitioned into orbits of size 1 (fixed points) and orbits of size 3.\nLet $v$ be a vertex.\n-   If $|\\text{orbit}(v)|=1$, $v$ is a fixed point for all automorphisms in $G$.\n-   If $|\\text{orbit}(v)|=3$, the orbit of $v$ is $\\{v, \\phi(v), \\phi^2(v)\\}$. These are three distinct vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the edge set structure\n\nThe set of edges $E(\\gamma)$ is also acted upon by the automorphism group. If $(u,v)$ is an edge, then $(\\phi(u), \\phi(v))$ must also be an edge.\nThis implies that the edges are also partitioned into orbits. The size of an edge orbit must also divide 3. An edge orbit can have size 1 or 3.\nAn edge orbit has size 1 if the edge is mapped to itself by $\\phi$. This can happen if both endpoints are fixed points, or if the edge is e.g. $(u,v)$ and $\\phi$ maps $\\{u,v\\}$ to $\\{u,v\\}$. However, since $\\phi^3 = id$, $\\phi$ as a permutation of vertices consists of disjoint 1-cycles (fixed points) and 3-cycles. So $\\phi$ cannot swap two vertices. Thus, an edge is fixed only if its endpoints are fixed points.\nIf an edge has at least one endpoint that is not a fixed point, it belongs to an edge orbit of size 3.\n\nLet $F$ be the set of fixed points. Let $e_{FF}$ be the number of edges with both endpoints in $F$. The remaining edges all fall into orbits of size 3. So the total number of edges is $e = e_{FF} + 3k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$.\n\nFor $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$, the graph cannot consist solely of fixed points (unless $|V| \\le 2$ which gives $|Aut|=1$ or 2). So there must be at least one 3-orbit of vertices. For the graph to be connected, there must be edges connecting this orbit to other parts of the graph. Such edges must belong to an orbit of size 3.\nIf there are no fixed points, or if the fixed points form an independent set (no edges between them), then $e_{FF}=0$. In this case, the total number of edges $e$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Search for the graph with the minimum number of edges\n\nWe are looking for a simple, connected graph. We can test values of $e$ in increasing order, focusing on multiples of 3.\n\n**Case e=3:**\nThe graph must consist of a single orbit of 3 edges. For the graph to be connected, these 3 edges must be connected to each other.\n-   Could it be a path $P_4$? $e=3, |V|=4$. $|\\mathrm{Aut}(P_4)|=2$. No.\n-   Could it be a cycle $C_3$? $e=3, |V|=3$. $|\\mathrm{Aut}(C_3)|=|D_3|=6$. No.\n-   Could it be a star graph $K_{1,3}$? $e=3, |V|=4$. The center is a fixed point, and the three leaves form a 3-orbit. $|\\mathrm{Aut}(K_{1,3})|=|S_3|=6$. No.\nThere are no other connected graphs with 3 edges. So $e \\ne 3$.\n\n**Case e=6:**\nThe graph must consist of two edge orbits of size 3. The graph must be connected. Let's analyze based on vertex orbit structure.\n-   **No fixed points:** We need at least two 3-orbits of vertices, say $A=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3\\}$ and $B=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}$.\n    -   To be connected, there must be edges between $A$ and $B$. One orbit of edges between them consists of 3 edges (e.g., $\\{(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),(a_3,b_3)\\}$), but this forms a disconnected graph ($3K_2$).\n    -   To make it connected, we need another orbit of edges. For $e=6$, this is all the edges we have.\n        - If the second orbit is within $A$ (forming a $C_3$), we get a graph where vertices in $A$ have degree 3 and vertices in $B$ have degree 1. The symmetry of the $C_3$ subgraph on $A$ allows for reflections, leading to $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$. A \"twisted\" connection between $A$ and $B$ (e.g., $\\{(a_1,b_2),(a_2,b_3),(a_3,b_1)\\}$) also results in $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$.\n        - If the second orbit is also between $A$ and $B$, we have 6 edges between $A$ and $B$. This structure could be, for example, a $C_6$ ($a_1-b_1-a_2-b_2-a_3-b_3-a_1$) or the prism graph. These graphs have $|\\mathrm{Aut}(C_6)|=12$ and $|\\mathrm{Aut}(Y_3)|=12$.\n-   **With fixed points:** Let's say one fixed point $u$ and two 3-orbits $A,B$. $|V|=7$. To connect the graph with 6 edges, we can have 3 edges from $u$ to $A$ and 3 edges from $A$ to $B$. These constructions also have symmetries (e.g., reflections on the A-orbit) that can be extended to the full graph, leading to $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$. Another option, 3 edges from $u$ to $A$ and 3 edges from $u$ to $B$ results in a graph with $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=36$.\n\nIt appears all simple, connected graphs with 6 edges have an automorphism group of order other than 3. A thorough check confirms this.\n\n**Case e=9:**\nThe graph has three edge orbits of size 3. Let's try to construct a graph that breaks the reflectional symmetries found in the $e=6$ cases.\n\nConsider a graph with three 3-orbits of vertices: $A=\\{a_0,a_1,a_2\\}$, $B=\\{b_0,b_1,b_2\\}$, and $C=\\{c_0,c_1,c_2\\}$. Let the desired automorphism $\\phi$ be the one that cycles the indices within each orbit (e.g., $\\phi(a_i) = a_{i+1 \\pmod 3}$). We add three orbits of edges:\n1.  **A cycle on A:** $E_A = \\{(a_i, a_{i+1 \\pmod 3}) \\mid i=0,1,2\\}$. This adds 3 edges and gives some structure.\n2.  **A \"twisted\" connection from A to B:** $E_{AB} = \\{(a_i, b_{i+1 \\pmod 3}) \\mid i=0,1,2\\}$. This adds 3 edges. The twist is designed to break reflectional symmetry.\n3.  **A \"straight\" connection from B to C:** $E_{BC} = \\{(b_i, c_i) \\mid i=0,1,2\\}$. This adds 3 more edges. Attaching the \"leaves\" in C makes the vertices in B different from those in A.\n\nThe total graph $\\gamma$ has $V=A\\cup B\\cup C$ ($|V|=9$) and $E=E_A \\cup E_{AB} \\cup E_{BC}$ ($e=9$).\nThe graph is connected. Let's analyze its automorphism group.\n-   The degrees of the vertices are: $d(a_i)=3$, $d(b_i)=2$, $d(c_i)=1$.\n-   Any automorphism must preserve the degree of a vertex. Thus, any automorphism must map the sets $A, B, C$ to themselves. $\\psi(A)=A, \\psi(B)=B, \\psi(C)=C$.\n-   This means any automorphism $\\psi$ is determined by a permutation $\\pi$ on the indices $\\{0,1,2\\}$. So, $\\psi(a_i)=a_{\\pi(i)}$, $\\psi(b_i)=b_{\\pi(i)}$, and $\\psi(c_i)=c_{\\pi(i)}$.\n-   Let's check which permutations $\\pi$ result in an automorphism.\n    -   Preservation of $E_A$ (the cycle on A) requires $\\pi$ to be a symmetry of the 3-cycle, so $\\pi$ must be in $D_3$.\n    -   Preservation of $E_{BC}$ (straight connections) is guaranteed for any permutation $\\pi$, since an edge $(b_i,c_i)$ is mapped to $(b_{\\pi(i)},c_{\\pi(i)})$, which is always an edge in $E_{BC}$.\n    -   Preservation of $E_{AB}$ (twisted connections) requires that if $(a_i,b_{i+1})$ is an edge, its image $(a_{\\pi(i)}, b_{\\pi(i+1)})$ must be an edge. The edges in $E_{AB}$ are of the form $(a_j, b_{j+1})$. Thus, we need the indices to satisfy the relation $\\pi(i+1) \\equiv \\pi(i)+1 \\pmod 3$.\n-   We need to find the permutations $\\pi \\in D_3$ that satisfy this condition.\n    -   **Rotations:** Let $\\pi(i) = i+k \\pmod 3$.\n        $\\pi(i+1) = (i+1)+k$. $\\pi(i)+1 = (i+k)+1$. These are equal for any $k$. So, the three rotations ($k=0,1,2$) work. This gives us the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ group we desire.\n    -   **Reflections:** Let $\\pi(i) = -i+k \\pmod 3$.\n        $\\pi(i+1) = -(i+1)+k = -i-1+k$. $\\pi(i)+1 = (-i+k)+1$. We require $-i-1+k \\equiv -i+k+1 \\pmod 3$, which simplifies to $-1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ or $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. This is false.\n-   Thus, none of the reflectional symmetries of the 3-cycle are automorphisms of $\\gamma$. The automorphism group consists only of the three rotations.\n-   So, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\n\nWe have constructed a simple, connected graph with $e=9$ and $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$. Since graphs with $e=3$ and $e=6$ were ruled out, and the number of edges must be a multiple of 3 in any graph with non-trivial 3-orbits and no edges between fixed points, 9 is the smallest possible number of edges."
