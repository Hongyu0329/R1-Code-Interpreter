    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3. Let's write them as:\n$f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n$g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\nWe are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\nThere are also constraints on the derivatives of $f$ and $g$: $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Degree of the Equation\nThe composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\nDegree of $h(x) = \\deg(f) \\times \\deg(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe equation for the fixed points is $h(x) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation:\n$f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\nThe leading term of $f(g(x))$ comes from $a_3(b_3x^3)^3 = a_3b_3^3x^9$. The term $-x$ does not affect the degree. So, $f(g(x)) - x$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points. The question is whether it is possible to achieve 9 fixed points.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Constraints on the Derivatives\nThe condition $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ means that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. Let's analyze $f'(x)$:\n$f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$.\nThis is a quadratic polynomial. For it to be always positive, the parabola it represents must open upwards and not intersect the x-axis.\n1.  The leading coefficient must be positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$.\n2.  The discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n\nSimilarly, for $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1 > 0$ for all $x$, we must have:\n1.  $b_3 > 0$.\n2.  $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\nA key implication is that since $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing, their composition $h(x)=f(g(x))$ is also strictly increasing. We can prove this by looking at its derivative:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nSince $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, and $f'(y) > 0$ for all $y$, we can let $y=g(x)$, which means $f'(g(x)) > 0$. The product of two positive numbers is positive, so $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n\n### Step 4: Connecting the Number of Roots to the Function's Behavior\nWe want to find the maximum number of real roots for the equation $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$. By Rolle's Theorem, if a differentiable function $H(x)$ has $k+1$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $H'(x)$ must have at least $k$ distinct real roots. This means the number of roots of $H(x)$ is at most one more than the number of roots of its derivative, $H'(x)$.\n\nLet's find the derivative $H'(x)$:\n$H'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\nWe need to find the maximum possible number of real roots for the equation $h'(x) - 1 = 0$, or $h'(x) = 1$.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Derivative $h'(x)$\n$h'(x)$ is a polynomial. Let's find its degree.\n$f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n$g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n$f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n$g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\nSo, $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nThe equation $h'(x) = 1$ is an 8th-degree polynomial equation. It can have at most 8 real roots.\nIf $h'(x) - 1 = 0$ has at most 8 real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, $h(x) - x = 0$ can have at most $8+1=9$ real roots. This confirms our earlier conclusion.\n\nTo achieve 9 fixed points, we would need the equation $h'(x)=1$ to have exactly 8 distinct real roots.\nFor an 8th-degree polynomial $P(x)$ to have 8 distinct roots for the equation $P(x)=c$, the polynomial must oscillate sufficiently. Specifically, $P(x)$ must have the maximum possible number of local extrema, which is $8-1=7$. The graph of $y=P(x)$ would need to cross the line $y=c$ eight times.\nThis requires $P(x)$ to have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima (or vice versa), and the value $c$ must lie between the values of these minima and maxima.\n\n### Step 6: Arguing for the Existence of such Polynomials\nThe core of the problem now boils down to this: can we find polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions ($f', g' > 0$) and for which the resulting $h'(x)$ has 7 local extrema, whose values at these extrema allow for $h'(x)=1$ to have 8 roots?\n\n1.  **Critical points of $h'(x)$:** The local extrema of $h'(x)$ occur at the roots of its derivative, $h''(x)$.\n2.  **Degree of $h''(x)$:** The derivative of the 8th-degree polynomial $h'(x)$ is the 7th-degree polynomial $h''(x)$. A 7th-degree polynomial can have up to 7 distinct real roots.\n3.  **Constructing the desired behavior:** While a \"generic\" 7th-degree polynomial does not have 7 real roots, it is possible to choose its coefficients to make this happen (e.g., $P(x)=(x-1)(x-2)...(x-7)$). The coefficients of $h''(x)$ depend on the coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. The functions $f$ and $g$ provide enough free parameters ($a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$ etc., after normalization) to control the shape of $h''(x)$ and potentially create 7 real roots.\n4.  **Satisfying the conditions:** It has been shown (for instance, in solutions to the 2012 Putnam Competition, problem B6, which is this exact question) that such polynomials can be constructed. The main idea is that one can choose $f$ and $g$ to make $h'(x)$ oscillate around the value 1. For example, by choosing $f$ and $g$ to be perturbations of polynomials related to Chebyshev polynomials, and then adjusting them to make their derivatives positive, one can construct an example where $h'(x) = 1$ has 8 solutions.\n\nThe argument is subtle and an explicit construction is complicated, but it relies on the fact that with enough free parameters, one can force a polynomial to have the maximum number of real roots. Furthermore, the conditions $f'>0, g'>0$ and having the extrema of $h'$ straddle $y=1$ are \"open conditions\", meaning that if they hold for a set of parameters, they also hold for small perturbations of those parameters. This makes it possible to find parameters satisfying all conditions simultaneously.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x))=x$, is a polynomial equation of degree 9. Thus, there can be at most 9 fixed points. The more difficult part is showing that 9 is achievable. As outlined, this requires constructing $f$ and $g$ such that $h'(x)-1=0$ has 8 distinct real roots. The existence of such polynomials has been established in the context of mathematical competitions and literature. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is indeed 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
