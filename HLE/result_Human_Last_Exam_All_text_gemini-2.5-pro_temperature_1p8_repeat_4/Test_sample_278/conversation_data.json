    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Parametric Curve:**\n    The curve is defined piecewise for the parameter $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n    *   **Part 1: $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n        Here, $b=1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$. This is the standard parameterization of a unit circle. Since $t$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, this part of the curve traces the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, starting from $(1, 0)$, going through $(0, 1)$, and ending at $(-1, 0)$.\n\n    *   **Part 2: $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n        Here, $b=5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$. This is a parameterization of an ellipse. We can write the corresponding Cartesian equation as $(\\frac{x}{1})^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = (\\cos t)^2 + (\\sin t)^2 = 1$, which is $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$. This is an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 (along the x-axis) and a semi-major axis of 5 (along the y-axis). As $t$ ranges from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, this part of the curve traces the lower half of this ellipse, starting from $(-1, 0)$, going through $(0, -5)$, and ending at $(1, 0)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Extent (Bounding Box) of the Figure:**\n    To find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to determine the figure's maximum dimensions. This is done by finding the minimum and maximum values of the x and y coordinates.\n    *   **Range of x:** For the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$. The maximum value of $\\cos t$ is 1 (at $t=0$) and the minimum value is -1 (at $t=\\pi$). So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$. The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n    *   **Range of y:**\n        For the first part ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$, which means $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n        For the second part ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5\\sin t$. In this interval for $t$, $\\sin t$ ranges from $0$ down to $-1$ and back to $0$. So, $y$ ranges from $0$ down to $-5$ and back to $0$. The range for y in this part is $[-5, 0)$.\n        Combining the two parts, the total range for the y-coordinate is $[-5, 1]$. The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n3.  **Define the Enclosing Rectangle:**\n    The figure is contained within an axis-aligned rectangle with corners at $(-1, -5)$, $(1, -5)$, $(1, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$. This rectangle has a width $W=2$ and a height $H=6$.\n\n4.  **Find the Smallest Enclosing Square for the Rectangle:**\n    The problem is now reduced to a geometric one: find the smallest square that can contain a $2 \\times 6$ rectangle.\n    There are two main possibilities for the orientation of the enclosing square:\n\n    *   **Case 1: Axis-aligned Square:**\n        If the square's sides are parallel to the rectangle's sides, its side length `s` must be at least as large as both the width and the height of the rectangle.\n        $s \\ge \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n        The smallest possible axis-aligned square has a side length of 6. Its area is $6^2 = 36$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Rotated Square:**\n        A smaller enclosing square might be found by rotating it. Let the square be rotated by an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the rectangle's axes. The side length `s` of the square must be large enough to accommodate the rectangle's dimensions when projected onto the square's rotated axes.\n        The side length `s` must satisfy: $s \\ge W\\cos\\theta + H\\sin\\theta$ and $s \\ge W\\sin\\theta + H\\cos\\theta$.\n        The smallest `s` for a given angle $\\theta$ is $s(\\theta) = \\max(W\\cos\\theta + H\\sin\\theta, W\\sin\\theta + H\\cos\\theta)$.\n        We want to find the angle $\\theta$ that minimizes this side length. The minimum value of $\\max(f,g)$ often occurs when $f=g$. Let's test this:\n        $W\\cos\\theta + H\\sin\\theta = W\\sin\\theta + H\\cos\\theta$\n        With $W=2$ and $H=6$:\n        $2\\cos\\theta + 6\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin\\theta + 6\\cos\\theta$\n        $4\\sin\\theta = 4\\cos\\theta$\n        $\\tan\\theta = 1$, which gives $\\theta = \\pi/4$ (or 45 degrees).\n\n        Now we calculate the side length at this optimal angle:\n        $s = 2\\cos(\\pi/4) + 6\\sin(\\pi/4) = 2(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) + 6(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{2}} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n        The area of this rotated square is $(4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 \\times 2 = 32$.\n\n5.  **Final Comparison:**\n    Comparing the two cases:\n    *   Area of the axis-aligned square = 36.\n    *   Area of the optimally rotated square = 32.\n    The smallest area is 32.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe area of the smallest square that outcircles the figure is 32.\n\n<<<32>>>"
