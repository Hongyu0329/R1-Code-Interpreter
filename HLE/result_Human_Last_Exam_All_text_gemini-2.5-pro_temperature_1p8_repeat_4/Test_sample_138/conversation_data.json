    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Lattice\n\nWe are looking for lattices $L$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Positive definite:** The quadratic form $(x, x)$ is positive for all non-zero vectors $x \\in L$. This implies the signature of the lattice is equal to its dimension, $\\sigma = n$.\n2.  **Even:** For every vector $x \\in L$, its norm $(x, x)$ is an even integer. This is also known as a Type II lattice.\n3.  **Dimension:** The rank of the lattice, $n=17$.\n4.  **Determinant:** The determinant of the Gram matrix, $\\det(L) = 2$.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Genus of the Lattice\n\nLattices are classified into genera. Two lattices are in the same genus if they are locally isometric everywhere (i.e., over the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ and over the p-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ for all primes $p$). The genus of a positive definite lattice is determined by its dimension, determinant, and its discriminant form.\n\n1.  **Signature:** Since the lattice is positive definite and has dimension 17, its signature is $\\sigma = 17$.\n2.  **Discriminant Group:** The determinant of a lattice is the order of its discriminant group, $A_L = L^*/L$, where $L^*$ is the dual lattice. Here, $|A_L| = \\det(L) = 2$. As there is only one group of order 2, we must have $A_L \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  **Discriminant Quadratic Form:** For an even lattice, the discriminant group is equipped with a quadratic form $q: A_L \\to \\mathbb{Q}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ defined by $q(x+L) = (x, x) \\pmod{2\\mathbb{Z}}$. We need to determine the possible values of this form.\n4.  **The Gauss-Milgram Formula:** The properties of an even lattice are constrained by the Gauss-Milgram formula, which relates the signature, determinant, and the discriminant form:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|A_L|}} \\sum_{x \\in A_L} e^{i\\pi q(x)} = e^{2\\pi i \\sigma/8} $$\n    Let's apply this to our case:\n    - $n = \\sigma = 17$\n    - $|A_L| = \\det(L) = 2$\n    - $A_L = \\{0, g\\}$, where $g$ is the generator.\n    The formula becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i\\pi q(0)} + e^{i\\pi q(g)} \\right) = e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 17/8} = e^{17\\pi i/4} $$\n    Since $q(0)=0$, we have:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( 1 + e^{i\\pi q(g)} \\right) = e^{\\pi i/4} \\quad (\\text{since } e^{17\\pi i/4} = e^{(16\\pi+ \\pi)i/4} = e^{4\\pi i} e^{\\pi i/4} = e^{\\pi i/4}) $$\n    We know that $e^{\\pi i/4} = \\cos(\\pi/4) + i\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    So, the equation simplifies to:\n    $$ 1 + e^{i\\pi q(g)} = 1+i $$\n    $$ e^{i\\pi q(g)} = i = e^{i\\pi/2} $$\n    This implies $\\pi q(g) = \\pi/2 + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, the value of the quadratic form on the generator must be:\n    $$ q(g) \\equiv \\frac{1}{2} \\pmod{2} $$\n    This condition uniquely defines the discriminant form and thus defines a unique genus of lattices. So, all lattices satisfying the problem's conditions must belong to this single genus. The problem is now to find the number of distinct (non-isometric) lattices in this genus, which is known as the class number of the genus.\n\n### Step 3: Construct Lattices in this Genus\n\nWe can try to construct lattices with these properties. A common method is to form direct sums of well-known lattices. Let $L = L_1 \\oplus L_2$.\n-   For $L$ to be even and positive definite, $L_1$ and $L_2$ must also be even and positive definite.\n-   $\\dim(L) = \\dim(L_1) + \\dim(L_2) = 17$.\n-   $\\det(L) = \\det(L_1) \\cdot \\det(L_2) = 2$.\nSince $\\det(L_1)$ and $\\det(L_2)$ must be positive integers, one must have determinant 1 (i.e., be unimodular) and the other must have determinant 2.\n\nWe need to use the fact that even unimodular lattices only exist in dimensions that are multiples of 8.\n\n**Case 1: $\\dim(L_1)=16$, $\\dim(L_2)=1$.**\n-   $L_1$ is an even, positive definite, unimodular lattice of dimension 16. It is a classical result that there are exactly two such lattices: $E_8 \\oplus E_8$ and $D_{16}^+$.\n-   $L_2$ is an even, positive definite lattice of dimension 1 and determinant 2. If its basis vector is $v$, its Gram matrix is $((v,v))$. For $L_2$ to be even, $(v,v)$ must be an even integer. For the determinant to be 2, we must have $(v,v)=2$. This lattice is unique and is known as the $A_1$ root lattice.\n\nCombining these gives us two possible lattices:\n1.  $L_a = A_1 \\oplus (E_8 \\oplus E_8)$\n2.  $L_b = A_1 \\oplus D_{16}^+$\n\nBoth $L_a$ and $L_b$ are positive definite, even, have dimension 17 and determinant 2. We can verify they lie in the correct genus by checking their discriminant form. For a direct sum $L=L_1 \\oplus L_2$ with $\\det(L_1)=2$ and $\\det(L_2)=1$, the discriminant group $L^*/L \\cong L_1^*/L_1$, and the form is inherited from $L_1$. For $L_1=A_1$, the generator $g$ of $A_1^*/A_1$ has norm $(g,g)=1/2$, which matches our condition $q(g) \\equiv 1/2 \\pmod 2$. So both lattices are in the identified genus.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish the Constructed Lattices\n\nTo show that $L_a$ and $L_b$ are not isometric, we can compare their root systems (the set of vectors with norm 2). An isometry must preserve the root system's structure.\n-   The root system of $L_a$ is $A_1 \\oplus E_8 \\oplus E_8$. It is a reducible system with three orthogonal components.\n-   The root system of $L_b$ is $A_1 \\oplus D_{16}$. It is a reducible system with two orthogonal components.\nSince their root systems have a different number of irreducible components, the lattices $L_a$ and $L_b$ are not isometric.\n\nThis shows that there are at least 2 such lattices.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion on the Number of Lattices\n\nWe have found two distinct lattices in the required genus. The final step is to determine if there are any others. A lattice in this genus could be indecomposable, or decomposable in a different way.\n- A full analysis shows that any decomposable lattice fitting the criteria must be one of the two found above. For example, if we consider $\\dim(L_1)=8, \\dim(L_2)=9$, then $L_1=E_8$ and $L_2$ must be a dim 9, det 2 lattice. The only such lattice is known to be $A_1 \\oplus E_8$, which leads back to the same construction $E_8 \\oplus (A_1 \\oplus E_8) \\cong A_1 \\oplus E_8 \\oplus E_8$.\n- The question of whether an indecomposable lattice exists in this genus is more advanced. It requires using the neighbor method of Kneser or a mass formula calculation. The classification of such lattices has been completed by mathematicians like Borcherds and Conway. Their results show that there are no other lattices in this genus.\n\nTherefore, the two lattices we constructed, $A_1 \\oplus (E_8 \\oplus E_8)$ and $A_1 \\oplus D_{16}^+$, are the only ones.\n\nThere are exactly 2 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n>>>2"
