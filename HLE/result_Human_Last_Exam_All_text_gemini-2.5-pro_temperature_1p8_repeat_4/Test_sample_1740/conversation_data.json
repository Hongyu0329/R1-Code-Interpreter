    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"let-7 family\" and the term \"member\"**\n\n*   The **let-7 family** is a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are highly conserved across species. They play critical roles in biological processes like developmental timing and tumor suppression.\n*   Membership in the family is primarily defined by a shared, conserved \"seed sequence\" (the sequence at positions 2-8 of the mature miRNA), which is `GAGGUAG` for the canonical let-7 family. This seed sequence determines which messenger RNAs (mRNAs) the miRNA can target and regulate.\n*   The term **\"member\"** in this context can be ambiguous. It could refer to:\n    1.  The number of distinct mature miRNA sequences.\n    2.  The number of distinct precursor genes that produce these miRNAs.\n*   The most common biological interpretation refers to the functionally distinct mature miRNAs, identified by their unique name (e.g., let-7a, let-7b).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the canonical let-7 members in humans**\n\n*   By searching authoritative biological databases such as miRBase (the primary repository for miRNA data), we can list the human (designated by the prefix \"hsa-\") miRNAs that are officially named \"let-7\".\n*   These are:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n*   This gives a count of **8** members based on the \"let-7\" name alone.\n\n**Step 3: Include other miRNAs that are functionally part of the family**\n\n*   Scientists include other miRNAs in the let-7 family if they share the same functional seed sequence, even if they have a different name.\n*   In humans, **miR-98** has the same seed sequence (`GAGGUAG`) as the let-7 family and is therefore universally considered to be a member.\n*   Adding miR-98 to the list brings the total number of distinct members to 9.\n*   **List of members:** let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n\n**Step 4: Acknowledge the careful distinction between members and genes**\n\n*   This is a crucial point of potential confusion. While there are 9 distinct mature miRNA members, they are encoded by a larger number of genes located at different positions in the human genome. This is a result of gene duplication during evolution.\n*   **let-7a** is produced by 3 different genes (*MIRLET7A1, MIRLET7A2, MIRLET7A3*).\n*   **let-7f** is produced by 2 different genes (*MIRLET7F1, MIRLET7F2*).\n*   Each of the other 7 members (let-7b, c, d, e, g, i, and miR-98) is produced by a single gene.\n*   Therefore, the total number of precursor genes is 3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 7 (for the others) = **12 genes**.\n*   While there are 12 *genes* that encode for the let-7 family, the question asks for the number of *members*, which refers to the 9 functionally distinct mature miRNA molecules.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard classification which counts the number of unique mature miRNA sequences (including those with identical seed sequences), there are 9 members in the human let-7 family.\n\n<<<9>>>"
