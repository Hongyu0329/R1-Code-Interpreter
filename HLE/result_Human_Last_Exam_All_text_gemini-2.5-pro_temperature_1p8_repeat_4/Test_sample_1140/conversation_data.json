    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule to be Synthesized\n*   **Type:** Peptide.\n*   **Size:** 100 amino acids (aa). This is a relatively large peptide, on the cusp between what is practical for purely chemical synthesis and what is typically produced using biological systems.\n*   **Composition:** Contains the 20 standard amino acids and one non-standard or unnatural amino acid (UAA), denoted as 'X'.\n*   **Identity of X:** 'X' is specified as azido phenylalanine, a derivative of the natural amino acid phenylalanine containing an azide (-N3) group.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques\n\nWe need to consider methods that can produce a peptide of this size and can also incorporate a UAA at a specific position.\n\n#### Technique 1: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\n*   **How it works:** Amino acids are coupled one by one to a growing peptide chain that is anchored to a solid resin bead.\n*   **Careful Points & Analysis:**\n    *   **UAA Incorporation:** SPPS is excellent for incorporating UAAs. As long as a protected version of azido phenylalanine (e.g., Fmoc-L-4-azidophenylalanine) is available, it can be added into the sequence just like any standard amino acid.\n    *   **Peptide Size (100aa):** This is the major drawback. Each coupling step has an efficiency less than 100%. For a 100-step synthesis, even with an excellent coupling efficiency of 99% per step, the theoretical maximum yield of the full-length correct product is only (0.99)^99 ≈ 37%. In practice, yields are often lower. The crude product would contain a very complex mixture of shorter, \"deletion\" sequences, making purification by methods like HPLC extremely challenging for a 100-mer peptide.\n*   **Conclusion:** SPPS is theoretically possible but practically very difficult, low-yielding, and inefficient for a peptide of this length.\n\n#### Technique 2: Standard Recombinant Protein Expression\n*   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a host organism (like *E. coli* or yeast). The host's cellular machinery (ribosomes, tRNAs, etc.) transcribes the gene to mRNA and translates the mRNA into the peptide.\n*   **Careful Points & Analysis:**\n    *   **Peptide Size (100aa):** This method is ideal for producing proteins of 100 aa and larger with high yields.\n    *   **UAA Incorporation:** This is the critical failure point. The genetic code and the cell's translational apparatus are designed for only the 20 canonical amino acids. There is no natural codon, tRNA, or charging enzyme (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase) for azido phenylalanine. The ribosome would likely terminate translation or mis-incorporate another amino acid at the codon meant for 'X'.\n*   **Conclusion:** Standard recombinant expression cannot be used to incorporate a UAA.\n\n#### Technique 3: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\n*   **How it works:** This is a semi-synthetic method where two smaller peptide fragments are chemically joined (ligated). One fragment must have a C-terminal thioester, and the other must have an N-terminal Cysteine.\n*   **Careful Points & Analysis:**\n    *   **Application:** One could synthesize a shorter fragment containing azido phenylalanine using SPPS (making it easy) and ligate it to a larger fragment produced recombinantly. This overcomes the length limitation of SPPS.\n    *   **The Cysteine Requirement:** Standard NCL strictly requires a Cysteine residue at the ligation site (specifically, at the N-terminus of the second fragment). The sequence given is `...KAVCLXVIG...`. To incorporate 'X', one might ligate between 'L' and 'X'. This would require the second fragment to be `Cys-X-V-I-G...`. This introduces an artificial Cysteine into the final sequence, altering the protein's primary structure, which is generally undesirable. While advanced methods exist for ligation at other residues, they are less efficient and the Cysteine requirement is the main principle.\n*   **Conclusion:** NCL is a powerful technique but is only ideal if a Cysteine naturally exists at a desired ligation junction. For an arbitrary sequence, it is not the most straightforward or \"helpful\" technique as it may require altering the sequence.\n\n#### Technique 4: Genetic Code Expansion (via Amber Suppression Mutagenesis)\n*   **How it works:** This is an advanced recombinant expression method specifically engineered to incorporate UAAs.\n    1.  **Reassign Codon:** A stop codon (usually UAG, the \"amber\" codon) is placed in the gene at the position where the UAA should be incorporated.\n    2.  **Orthogonal Pair:** An engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and its corresponding engineered tRNA are introduced into the host cell. This pair is \"orthogonal\"—it functions independently of the host's own synthetases and tRNAs.\n    3.  **UAA Incorporation:** The engineered aaRS is designed to specifically recognize the UAA (azido phenylalanine, which is added to the cell culture medium) and attach it to the engineered tRNA. The engineered tRNA is designed to recognize the UAG stop codon.\n    4.  **Translation:** When the ribosome encounters the UAG codon, the engineered tRNA delivers the azido phenylalanine, which is incorporated into the growing peptide chain, and translation continues.\n*   **Careful Points & Analysis:**\n    *   **Peptide Size (100aa):** Perfectly suitable. It leverages the efficiency of recombinant expression.\n    *   **UAA Incorporation:** This technique is explicitly designed for this purpose. It allows for the precise, site-specific incorporation of a UAA into a protein of virtually any size. Azido phenylalanine is one of the most common UAAs incorporated using this method.\n*   **Conclusion:** This technique combines the high yield of recombinant expression with the chemical versatility of UAA incorporation. It is the most modern, efficient, and well-suited technique for the described problem.\n\n### Final Synthesis of Analysis\n\nFor a 100-amino acid peptide containing a specific unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, **Genetic Code Expansion** is the most helpful and powerful technique. It avoids the severe yield and purification issues of total chemical synthesis (SPPS) for a peptide this long, and it overcomes the inability of standard biological systems to handle unnatural building blocks.\n\n<<<Genetic Code Expansion>>>"
