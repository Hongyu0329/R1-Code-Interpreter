    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Riddle's Core Question**\nThe first crucial point is to understand the title, \"The Bays\". The riddle states that the title is a question. \"The Bays\" is phonetically similar to \"The B's\". Therefore, the central question of the riddle is, \"What are the B's?\". The haiku that follows is meant to provide the clues to answer this question.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku for Clues**\nThe haiku has three lines, suggesting it will provide clues for three \"B\" words. The themes in the haiku seem to point towards a single, well-known story.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   \"August\" means majestic, venerable, or inspiring awe.\n    *   \"Tempest\" means a violent turmoil or storm.\n    *   This line suggests a majestic and terrible event. In the context of the other lines, this can be interpreted as the great turmoil of the Passion of Christ, which involved carrying a great **Burden**. This is our first \"B\" word.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is thirty (2 * 15 = 30).\n    *   In a biblical context, \"thirty pieces of silver\" is the infamous price paid to Judas to betray Jesus.\n    *   This act was a pivotal moment that brought \"winds of change\". The clear \"B\" word from this clue is **Betrayal**.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to Jesus Christ.\n    *   To \"yield\" means to surrender or give way. This line describes the sacrifice of Jesus.\n    *   A key element of this sacrifice was the shedding of his **Blood** for the atonement of sins. This gives us our third \"B\" word.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Answer**\nWe have identified three \"B\" words that are clued by the haiku and all relate to the same biblical narrative:\n1.  **Burden**\n2.  **Betrayal**\n3.  **Blood**\n\n**Step 4: Follow the Final Instruction**\nThe final instruction is: \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\". This means we must take our three \"B\" words and list them in alphabetical order.\n\n1.  Comparing the words: B**e**trayal, B**l**ood, B**u**rden.\n2.  Looking at the second letter of each word (e, l, u), we can establish the correct alphabetical sequence.\n\nThe alphabetized list is:\n1.  **Betrayal**\n2.  **Blood**\n3.  **Burden**\n\nThis ordered list is the complete answer to the question.\n\n<<<Betrayal, Blood, Burden>>>"
