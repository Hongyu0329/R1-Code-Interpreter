    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe main objective is to compute the definite integral of the piecewise function `p(x)` over the interval from `x = 0` to `x = 4`.\nThe function `p(x)` is defined as:\n*   `p(x) = (2x^3) / 8`  for `0 <= x <= 3`\n*   `p(x) = (e^x * (1 + sin x)) / (1 + cos x)` for `3 <= x <= 5`\n\n### **Step 2: Decompose the Integral**\n\nThe integration interval is `[0, 4]`. The function definition changes at `x = 3`. Therefore, we must split the integral into two parts at `x = 3`:\n\nIntegral =  ∫₀⁴ `p(x) dx` = ∫₀³ `p(x) dx` + ∫₃⁴ `p(x) dx`\n\nWe will now calculate each integral separately.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the First Integral (from 0 to 3)**\n\nFor the interval `[0, 3]`, the function is `p(x) = (2x^3) / 8`.\n\n1.  **Simplify the function:**\n    `p(x) = (2x^3) / 8 = x^3 / 4`\n\n2.  **Find the antiderivative:**\n    ∫`(x^3 / 4) dx` = `(1/4) * ∫x^3 dx` = `(1/4) * (x^4 / 4)` = `x^4 / 16`\n\n3.  **Evaluate the definite integral:**\n    ∫₀³ `(x^3 / 4) dx` = `[x^4 / 16]` from 0 to 3\n    = `(3^4 / 16) - (0^4 / 16)`\n    = `81 / 16 - 0`\n    = `81 / 16`\n\nSo, the first part of the integral is `81 / 16`.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Second Integral (from 3 to 4)**\n\nFor the interval `[3, 4]`, the function is `p(x) = (e^x * (1 + sin x)) / (1 + cos x)`.\n\n1.  **Careful Point: Simplify the integrand.** This expression looks complex, but it might fit a special integration pattern, specifically the form `∫e^x(f(x) + f'(x)) dx = e^x f(x)`. Let's try to simplify the trigonometric part: `(1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x)`.\n\n2.  **Use half-angle identities:**\n    *   `sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)`\n    *   `1 + cos x = 1 + (2 cos^2(x/2) - 1) = 2 cos^2(x/2)`\n\n3.  **Substitute these into the fraction:**\n    `(1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x) = (1 + 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)) / (2 cos^2(x/2))`\n\n4.  **Split the fraction:**\n    `= 1 / (2 cos^2(x/2)) + (2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)) / (2 cos^2(x/2))`\n    `= (1/2) sec^2(x/2) + sin(x/2) / cos(x/2)`\n    `= tan(x/2) + (1/2) sec^2(x/2)`\n\n5.  **Rewrite the integrand:**\n    The original integrand for this part, `e^x * ( (1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x) )`, can now be written as:\n    `p(x) = e^x * [ tan(x/2) + (1/2) sec^2(x/2) ]`\n\n6.  **Apply the integration rule:**\n    Let `f(x) = tan(x/2)`.\n    Then, using the chain rule, its derivative `f'(x)` is:\n    `f'(x) = d/dx(tan(x/2)) = sec^2(x/2) * d/dx(x/2) = sec^2(x/2) * (1/2)`\n    The integrand is exactly in the form `e^x(f(x) + f'(x))`.\n\n7.  **Find the antiderivative:**\n    The antiderivative is `e^x f(x) = e^x tan(x/2)`.\n\n8.  **Evaluate the definite integral:**\n    ∫₃⁴ `p(x) dx` = `[e^x tan(x/2)]` from 3 to 4\n    = `(e^4 * tan(4/2)) - (e^3 * tan(3/2))`\n    = `e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(1.5)`\n\n    **Careful Point:** Angles `2` and `1.5` are in radians.\n\n### **Step 5: Combine the Results**\n\nNow we add the results from Step 3 and Step 4.\n\nTotal Integral = `(81 / 16) + (e^4 tan(2) - e^3 tan(1.5))`\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\nLet's compute the numerical value for each term.\n*   `81 / 16 = 5.0625`\n*   `e^4 ≈ 54.5982`\n*   `tan(2)` (in radians) `≈ -2.1850`\n*   `e^3 ≈ 20.0855`\n*   `tan(1.5)` (in radians) `≈ 14.1014`\n\nNow, substitute these values:\n*   `e^4 tan(2) ≈ 54.5982 * (-2.1850) ≈ -119.2970`\n*   `e^3 tan(1.5) ≈ 20.0855 * 14.1014 ≈ 283.2263`\n\nTotal Integral ≈ `5.0625 + (-119.2970) - 283.2263`\nTotal Integral ≈ `5.0625 - 119.2970 - 283.2263`\nTotal Integral ≈ `5.0625 - 402.5233`\nTotal Integral ≈ `-397.4608`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the answer is approximately -397.5. Let's provide a more precise value. The exact symbolic answer is often preferred unless a numerical approximation is specified. The exact answer is `81/16 + e^4*tan(2) - e^3*tan(1.5)`. Let's calculate this with high precision: `-397.460814...`. Let's stick with this for the final answer.\n\n<<<81/16 + e^4*tan(2) - e^3*tan(1.5)>>>"
