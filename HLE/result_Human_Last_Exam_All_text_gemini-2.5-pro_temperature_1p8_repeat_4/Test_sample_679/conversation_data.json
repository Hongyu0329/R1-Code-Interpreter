    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:**\n    The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. This follows the general formula $C_nH_{2n}$, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This can be either a double bond (C=C) or a ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Chemical Shifts:**\n    The provided chemical shifts are 145 ppm and 112 ppm.\n    *   Chemical shifts in the range of 100-150 ppm are characteristic of alkene carbons ($sp^2$ hybridized).\n    *   The presence of these two signals strongly indicates the degree of unsaturation is a C=C double bond, so the compound is an alkene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Number of Signals and Symmetry:**\n    *   The molecule has 7 carbon atoms ($C_7H_{14}$).\n    *   The $^{13}C$ NMR spectrum shows only 6 distinct signals.\n    *   This means two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, and therefore, they produce a single, overlapping signal. This indicates the molecule possesses some form of symmetry.\n\n4.  **Analyze the DEPT Information (Multiplicity):**\n    The multiplicity of each signal (s, t, d, q) tells us how many hydrogen atoms are attached to each carbon atom.\n    *   s = singlet = Quaternary carbon (C, 0 hydrogens)\n    *   t = triplet = Methylene carbon (CH$_2$, 2 hydrogens)\n    *   d = doublet = Methine carbon (CH, 1 hydrogen)\n    *   q = quartet = Methyl carbon (CH$_3$, 3 hydrogens)\n    Let's list the signals and their types:\n    *   145 ppm (s): A quaternary carbon (C). Since it's in the alkene region, this is one of the carbons in the C=C bond.\n    *   112 ppm (t): A CH$_2$ carbon. Since it's in the alkene region, this is the other carbon in the C=C bond.\n    *   Together, the 145(s) and 112(t) signals define a terminal disubstituted alkene group: `>C=CH₂`.\n    *   48 ppm (t): An aliphatic CH$_2$ group.\n    *   27 ppm (d): An aliphatic CH group.\n    *   22 ppm (q): An aliphatic CH$_3$ group.\n    *   21 ppm (q): Another aliphatic CH$_3$ group.\n\n5.  **Identify the Overlapping Signal:**\n    Let's sum the carbons and hydrogens from the 6 signals to see what's missing.\n    *   Carbons accounted for: C + CH$_2$ + CH$_2$ + CH + CH$_3$ + CH$_3$ = 6 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens accounted for: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11 hydrogens.\n    The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens (14 - 11 = 3).\n    This means the missing C and 3 H's come from one of the signals being equivalent to another C and 3 H's. The only signal that can account for a CH$_3$ fragment is a quartet (q). Therefore, one of the quartet signals must represent two equivalent CH$_3$ groups.\n    Let's check the math:\n    *   Assume one 'q' signal represents 2 x CH$_3$.\n    *   Total Carbons = 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 1(q) + 2(q) = 7 carbons. Correct.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + (2 x 3) = 14 hydrogens. Correct.\n    So, our structural building blocks are: one `C` (quat), two `CH₂`, one `CH`, and three `CH₃` groups, two of which are chemically equivalent.\n\n6.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    *   A `>C=CH₂` group (from the 145s and 112t signals).\n    *   An aliphatic `CH₂` group (from the 48t signal).\n    *   An aliphatic `CH` group (from the 27d signal).\n    *   A unique `CH₃` group (from one of the 'q' signals, 21 or 22 ppm).\n    *   Two equivalent `CH₃` groups (from the other 'q' signal).\n\n    Let's assemble them:\n    *   The only way to have two equivalent methyl (CH$_3$) groups in this collection of fragments is if they are both attached to the same carbon atom. Attaching them to the `CH` group forms an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This fragment accounts for the `CH` (27d) and the two equivalent `CH₃` groups (one of the q signals).\n    *   The remaining aliphatic fragments are a `CH₂` group (48t) and a unique `CH₃` group (the other q signal). These logically connect to form an ethyl group: `-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   Now, we must attach our assembled groups to the central `>C=CH₂` unit. The quaternary carbon `>C=` has two available bonds. These are filled by the isopropyl group and the ethyl group.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n              CH(CH₃)₂\n             /\n          C=CH₂\n         /\n      CH₂CH₃\n        ```\n\n7.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    To name this alkene, we follow IUPAC rules:\n    *   Find the longest carbon chain that includes both carbons of the double bond.\n        *   Chain 1: `H₂C=C-CH₂-CH₃` (4 carbons). The substituents would be at C2 (isopropyl). Name: 2-isopropylbut-1-ene.\n        *   Chain 2: `H₂C=C-CH(CH₃)-CH₃` (4 carbons). The substituents would be at C2 (ethyl) and C3 (methyl). Name: 2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene.\n    *   When two chains of equal length are possible, choose the one with the greater number of substituents.\n        *   Chain 1 gives one substituent (isopropyl).\n        *   Chain 2 gives two substituents (ethyl and methyl).\n    *   Therefore, the correct parent chain is the second one, and the correct IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**.\n\n8.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    The structure is achiral. Because of this, the two methyl groups of the isopropyl group are enantiotopic and are chemically equivalent in a standard NMR experiment, consistent with the observation of a single signal for two CH₃ groups. The number and type of all signals match the derived structure.\n\nFinal Answer: The IUPAC name of the compound is 2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
