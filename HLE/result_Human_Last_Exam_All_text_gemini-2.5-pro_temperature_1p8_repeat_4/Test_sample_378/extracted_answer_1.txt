There is no record of a specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan made a distinct public act of identifying himself as "Azikiwe." The name "Azikiwe" is part of his official birth name and has been on public record throughout his political career, which began in 1999. The question is based on a flawed premise, as no such singular event occurred.
