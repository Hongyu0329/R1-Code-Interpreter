    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Synthesis Reaction:** The most common method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is the direct reaction of elemental Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F2). The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n    `Xe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)`\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conditions for Synthesis:** The formation of different xenon fluorides (XeF2, XeF4, XeF6) is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, specifically the temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants (Xe:F2).\n    *   **Reactant Ratio:** To produce XeF4, a molar excess of fluorine is typically used, commonly a ratio of around 1:5 (Xe:F2). This helps to drive the reaction past XeF2 but avoids the formation of XeF6.\n    *   **Temperature:** Temperature is critical. The reaction requires a significant activation energy to start.\n        *   If the temperature is too low, the reaction rate is practically zero, and the production is not \"efficient\".\n        *   If the temperature is too high, the reaction may favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6), or the XeF4 product itself might begin to decompose back into its elements.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Standard Production Temperatures for Xenon Fluorides:**\n    *   **Xenon difluoride (XeF2):** Can be formed under milder conditions, sometimes even by exposing the gases to sunlight at room temperature.\n    *   **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4):** The established, standard laboratory method for efficient production involves heating the 1:5 mixture of xenon and fluorine in a sealed nickel vessel. The optimal temperature for this process is widely cited to be **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate to give a high yield of XeF4.\n    *   **Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6):** Requires even more extreme conditions, typically higher temperatures (around 500-600 °C) and a much larger excess of fluorine (e.g., 1:20 ratio).\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Evaluation of Answer Choices:**\n    *   The question asks for the *coldest* temperature at which XeF4 can be produced *efficiently*. \"Efficiently\" implies a good reaction rate and high yield of the desired product.\n    *   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is too high and is used to synthesize XeF6, not XeF4.\n    *   **B. 400 C:** This is the textbook temperature for the standard, efficient synthesis of XeF4. While some reaction might occur at slightly lower temperatures over very long periods, 400 °C is considered the benchmark for an efficient process.\n    *   **C. 200 C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be significantly slower, making the process inefficient in terms of time and yield.\n    *   **D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary activation energy for the direct thermal reaction between Xe and F2 to proceed at any practical or efficient rate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the established chemical literature for the synthesis of noble gas compounds, 400 °C is the standard and lowest temperature from the given options at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently by the direct combination of its elements.\n\n<<<B>>>"
