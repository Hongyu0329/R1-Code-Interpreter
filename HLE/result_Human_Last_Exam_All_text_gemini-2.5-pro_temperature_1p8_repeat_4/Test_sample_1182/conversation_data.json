    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points of the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}_2$).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the curve and the question**\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve defined by the equation $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThe degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $d=5$.\nThe genus of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2=f(x)$ is given by $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor$.\nFor our curve, $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nThe question asks for the number of double points (also known as nodes or ordinary double points) in the stable reduction of this curve over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The prime is $p=2$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the branch points of the curve and their valuations**\nThe branch points of the hyperelliptic curve are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the point at infinity (since the degree is odd).\nLet's find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8) = 0$.\nOne root is clearly $r_0 = 0$.\nThe other four roots, let's call them $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, are the roots of the polynomial $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nWe use the Newton polygon method to find the valuations of the roots of $g(x)$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are plotted using the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\nThe coefficients of $g(x)$ are $a_4=8, a_3=4, a_2=4, a_1=1, a_0=8$.\nTheir 2-adic valuations are $v_2(a_4)=3, v_2(a_3)=2, v_2(a_2)=2, v_2(a_1)=0, v_2(a_0)=3$.\nThe points to plot are $(4,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,0), (0,3)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points has two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(0,3)$ with slope $(3-0)/(0-1) = -3$. The horizontal length is 1. This corresponds to one root, $\\alpha_1$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_1) = -(\\text{slope}) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  A segment from $(4,3)$ to $(1,0)$ with slope $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. The horizontal length is 3. This corresponds to three roots, $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, each with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = -1$.\nSo, the set of branch points is $B = \\{0, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Cluster the branch points**\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by how its branch points cluster together in the 2-adic sense. Two branch points $b_i, b_j$ are in the same cluster if they are \"close\", which means $v_2(b_i - b_j) > 0$. To handle the point at infinity, we use the coordinate $z=1/x$, which maps $\\infty$ to $0$.\n\nLet's identify the clusters:\n-   **Cluster 1:** Consider the points $0$ and $\\alpha_1$. The distance is $v_2(\\alpha_1 - 0) = v_2(\\alpha_1) = 3$. Since $3 > 0$, the points $0$ and $\\alpha_1$ are in the same cluster.\n    Let's check if any other branch points belong to this cluster.\n    For $i \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$, $v_2(\\alpha_i - 0) = v_2(\\alpha_i) = -1 \\le 0$. So $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ are not in this cluster.\n    Also, $v_2(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_1) = \\min(v_2(\\alpha_i), v_2(\\alpha_1)) = \\min(-1, 3) = -1 \\le 0$.\n    To check the distance to $\\infty$, we use the $z=1/x$ coordinate. The distance between $\\alpha_1$ and $\\infty$ corresponds to $v_2(1/\\alpha_1 - 0) = -v_2(\\alpha_1) = -3 \\le 0$.\n    Thus, the first cluster is $S_1 = \\{0, \\alpha_1\\}$. It has $|S_1|=2$ points.\n\n-   **Cluster 2:** The remaining points are $\\{\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$. Let's check if they form a single cluster. We use the $z=1/x$ coordinate, where the points become $\\{1/\\alpha_2, 1/\\alpha_3, 1/\\alpha_4, 0\\}$.\n    The valuations are $v_2(1/\\alpha_i) = -v_2(\\alpha_i) = -(-1) = 1$ for $i=2,3,4$.\n    The distance from $1/\\alpha_i$ to $0$ is $v_2(1/\\alpha_i - 0) = 1 > 0$. So all three points $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ are in the same cluster as $\\infty$.\n    We must also check the distances between $1/\\alpha_i$ for $i \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$. We have shown in thought process that $v_2(1/\\alpha_i - 1/\\alpha_j) = 1 > 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n    Thus, all points in $\\{\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$ are interconnected and form a single cluster, $S_2$. It has $|S_2|=4$ points.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the stable reduction**\nThe stable reduction $\\bar{C}$ is a nodal curve whose components correspond to the clusters of branch points. Here we have two clusters, so there are two components, $\\bar{C_1}$ and $\\bar{C_2}$.\n-   The genus of the component $\\bar{C_1}$ associated with cluster $S_1$ is given by $g_1 = (|S_1|/2) - 1 = (2/2)-1 = 0$. So $\\bar{C_1}$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n-   The genus of the component $\\bar{C_2}$ associated with cluster $S_2$ is given by $g_2 = (|S_2|/2) - 1 = (4/2)-1 = 1$. So $\\bar{C_2}$ is an elliptic curve.\n\nThe stable reduction $\\bar{C}$ is the union of a rational curve and an elliptic curve. These two components must intersect at some number of points, which are the double points of the stable reduction.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of double points**\nThe genus of the generic fiber $C$ is related to the genera of the components of its stable reduction $\\bar{C}$ and the number of double points (nodes) $\\delta$. The formula for a connected stable curve with $k$ components is:\n$g = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} g_i + \\delta - k + 1$\nIn our case, $g=2$, $k=2$, $g_1=0$, and $g_2=1$.\n$2 = (g_1 + g_2) + \\delta - 2 + 1$\n$2 = (0 + 1) + \\delta - 1$\n$2 = 1 + \\delta - 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\nSo, the number of double points is 2. The stable reduction consists of a rational curve and an elliptic curve intersecting at two points."
