    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the core subject:** The question is about Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the United Kingdom during World War II.\n2.  **Identify the central problem:** British counterintelligence (MI5) suspected him of being a German spy.\n3.  **Identify the reason for suspicion:** The suspicion arose because he concealed his true profession from his interrogators. This act of deception was interpreted as a sign that he had something to hide, like being an enemy agent.\n4.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks to find out what Vernault's *true* profession was.\n5.  **Research the case:** This case is documented in historical accounts of British counterintelligence, most notably in Ben Macintyre's book \"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies.\"\n6.  **Uncover the details:** According to historical records, Vernault was indeed a refugee who came under intense scrutiny. During his interrogation by MI5, he claimed to be an engineer. However, MI5's investigation could not substantiate this claim, which deepened their suspicion.\n7.  **Determine the motivation for the lie:** The reason for his deception was not related to espionage. Vernault was simply ashamed of his real job, which he considered to be low-status and unpleasant. He invented a more respectable profession (engineer) to make a better impression.\n8.  **Identify the true profession:** His actual, concealed profession was that of a **slaughterman** (or abattoir-worker). This was the secret he was trying to hide, and which nearly led to him being wrongly imprisoned as a spy.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   The suspicion was not based on any concrete evidence of spying but on a logical deduction by interrogators: an innocent man has no reason to lie, therefore a man who lies is not innocent.\n*   This case highlights the intense paranoia and scrutiny that all refugees faced from security services during the war.\n*   Vernault's motivation was purely social and personal (shame and a desire for respectability) rather than political or military.\n*   The lie he told (claiming to be an engineer) was a more \"respectable\" profession than his actual one.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\n\nBased on the analysis of historical accounts, Andre Vernault's true profession, which he concealed out of embarrassment, was that of a slaughterman.\n\n<<<slaughterman"
