    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step 1: Syllabification and Basic Quantities\n\nFirst, let's break down the line into syllables and identify the natural length of the vowels. A vowel is long by nature (e.g., has a macron, ā) or is part of a diphthong (ae, au, oe, etc.). It is long by position if it's followed by two or more consonants. All other vowels are short.\n\n*   `ve-rum u-bi e-qui at-que ho-mi-nis ca-su con-ve-nit i-ma-go.`\n\nLet's assess the quantities:\n*   **verum**: `vĕrum`. The `e` is short.\n*   **ubi**: `ŭbĭ`. Both vowels are short.\n*   **equi**: `ĕquī`. Genitive singular of `equus` is `equī`, with a long `ī`. The initial `e` is short.\n*   **atque**: `ātque`. The `a` is long by position (followed by `t` and `q`). The `e` is short.\n*   **hominis**: `hŏmĭnĭs`. All vowels are short.\n*   **casu**: `cāsū`. From `casus, -ūs`, both vowels are long.\n*   **convenit**: This can be present (`cŏnvĕnĭt`, all vowels short) or perfect (`cōnvēnīt`, long `e`). The meter will determine which one it is.\n*   **imago**: `ĭmāgō`. Short `i`, long `a`, and the final `o` is typically long.\n\n### Step 2: Elision\n\nIdentify where a final vowel (or vowel + m) is elided (dropped) because the next word begins with a vowel or 'h'.\n\n1.  `veru**m u**bi`: The `-um` of `verum` is elided. We scan `ver' ubi`.\n2.  `equ**i a**tque`: The long `ī` of `equi` is elided. We scan `equ' atque`.\n3.  `atqu**e ho**minis`: The `-e` of `atque` is elided. We scan `atqu' hominis`.\n\n### Step 3: Scanning Foot by Foot\n\nA hexameter line has six feet. The first four can be dactyls (D: — ∪ ∪) or spondees (S: — —). The fifth is almost always a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n\n**Foot 1:** `verum ubi`\n*   The line begins `ver-`. The short `e` is followed by `r` and `m`, making it long by position (`—`).\n*   The `um` elides. The next sounds are `u` and `bi` from `ubi`, both of which are short (`∪ ∪`).\n*   Combining them: `vēr(um)‿ŭbĭ`. This forms a perfect Dactyl.\n*   **Result: D**\n\n**Foot 2:** `equi atque`\n*   The scansion continues from `equi`. The `e`, which is naturally short, must be treated as long (`—`) to begin the foot, a common poetic license.\n*   The long `ī` of `equī` is elided before `atque`.\n*   The `at-` of `atque` is long by position (`—`).\n*   Combining them: `ēqu(ī)‿āt-`. This forms a Spondee.\n*   **Result: S**\n\n**Foot 3:** `(at)que hominis`\n*   The foot begins with `-que`, whose `-e` elides before `hominis`. The `qu-` sound attaches to `hominis`.\n*   The `o` of `hominis` is naturally short. To fit the dactylic pattern, it must be poetically lengthened to long (`—`).\n*   The syllables `mi` and `nis` are both short (`∪ ∪`).\n*   Combining them: `-qu(e)‿hōmĭnĭs`. This forms a Dactyl.\n*   **Result: D**\n\n**Foot 4:** `casu`\n*   The ablative form `cāsū` has two naturally long vowels.\n*   `cā-` is long (`—`). `-sū` is long (`—`).\n*   This forms a perfect Spondee.\n*   **Result: S**\n\n**Foot 5:** `convenit`\n*   To fit the pattern of the fifth foot being a dactyl, the verb must be the present tense `cŏnvĕnĭt`.\n*   `con-` is long by position (`—`).\n*   The syllables `-ve-` and `-nit` are both short (`∪ ∪`).\n*   This forms a perfect Dactyl.\n*   **Result: D**\n\n**Foot 6:** `imago`\n*   The word is `ĭmāgō` (`∪ — —`).\n*   The final foot of a hexameter is a spondee (or trochee, counted as a spondee). To fit this two-syllable foot, the initial short `ĭ` is dropped by poetic license.\n*   This leaves `māgō`, which is a Spondee (`— —`).\n*   **Result: S**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the analysis of all six feet gives the following pattern: Dactyl, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee.\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
