The appropriate management involves a phased approach, starting with an immediate medical referral to control her diabetes mellitus, followed by acute dental wound care and a temporary denture. The cells of interest are primarily neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts, as their function in healing is impaired by hyperglycemia.

For definitive replacement, the most suitable option is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture** made of a **Cobalt-Chromium alloy**.

The **abutment teeth** will include:
1.  **Primary Abutments:** The **left central incisor** and the **left second premolar**, which are adjacent to the gap, to provide direct support and retention.
2.  **Secondary Abutments:** Molars on the **right side** of the arch (e.g., the right first and second molars).

**Reason for this specific abutment selection:** Using abutments on the opposite side of the arch provides **cross-arch stabilization**. This is critical to counteract the heavy, non-axial forces generated by her skeletal Class III jaw relationship (SNB 88‚Å∞), ensuring the stability and longevity of the denture and protecting the remaining teeth from mechanical overload.
