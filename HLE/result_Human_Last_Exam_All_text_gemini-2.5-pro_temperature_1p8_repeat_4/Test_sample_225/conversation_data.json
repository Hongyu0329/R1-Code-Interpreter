    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Curve\nThe curve is a Lissajous curve.\n*   The x-component, x(t) = cos(9t), has a period of T_x = 2π/9.\n*   The y-component, y(t) = sin(5t), has a period of T_y = 2π/5.\n*   The period of the entire curve is the least common multiple of T_x and T_y, which is LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π.\n*   Therefore, the curve traces itself completely over any interval of length 2π, for instance, t ∈ [0, 2π).\n\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) that the curve passes through at two or more different times t1, t2 within the fundamental period [0, 2π). So, we are looking for the number of unique points (x, y) for which (x(t1), y(t1)) = (x(t2), y(t2)) with 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π.\n\nThe problem can be broken down into finding the number of intersection points on the coordinate axes and the number of intersection points not on the axes (in the open quadrants).\n\nLet n=9 and m=5. The equations are x(t) = cos(nt) and y(t) = sin(mt). Both n and m are odd and coprime.\n\n### Step 2: Find Intersections on the x-axis\nFor a point to be on the x-axis, its y-coordinate must be zero.\ny(t) = sin(5t) = 0\nThis occurs when 5t = kπ for some integer k.\nt = kπ/5.\nFor t ∈ [0, 2π), k can be any integer from 0 to 9. So we have 10 time values: t = 0, π/5, 2π/5, ..., 9π/5.\n\nA self-intersection on the x-axis requires that for two different times t1 and t2 from this set, the x-coordinates are the same.\nx(t1) = x(t2) => cos(9t1) = cos(9t2).\nLet t1 = k1π/5 and t2 = k2π/5, with k1 ≠ k2 and k1, k2 ∈ {0, 1, ..., 9}.\ncos(9k1π/5) = cos(9k2π/5).\nThis equality holds if 9k1π/5 = ±9k2π/5 + 2jπ for some integer j.\nDividing by π/5, we get 9k1 = ±9k2 + 10j.\nCase 2.1: 9(k1 - k2) = 10j. Since 9 and 10 are coprime, (k1 - k2) must be a multiple of 10. For distinct k1, k2 in {0, ..., 9}, this is impossible.\nCase 2.2: 9(k1 + k2) = 10j. Since 9 and 10 are coprime, (k1 + k2) must be a multiple of 10.\nPossible pairs {k1, k2} from {1, ..., 9} whose sum is 10 are: {1, 9}, {2, 8}, {3, 7}, {4, 6}.\nThese are 4 pairs of time values. Let's find the corresponding x-coordinates to see how many unique points they represent.\n*   {t=π/5, t=9π/5}: x = cos(9π/5) = cos(π/5). Point: (cos(π/5), 0).\n*   {t=2π/5, t=8π/5}: x = cos(18π/5) = cos(2π/5). Point: (cos(2π/5), 0).\n*   {t=3π/5, t=7π/5}: x = cos(27π/5) = cos(3π/5) = -cos(2π/5). Point: (-cos(2π/5), 0).\n*   {t=4π/5, t=6π/5}: x = cos(36π/5) = cos(4π/5) = -cos(π/5). Point: (-cos(π/5), 0).\nThe values cos(π/5) and cos(2π/5) are distinct and non-zero. Thus, we have 4 distinct self-intersection points on the x-axis.\n\n### Step 3: Find Intersections on the y-axis\nFor a point to be on the y-axis, its x-coordinate must be zero.\nx(t) = cos(9t) = 0.\nThis occurs when 9t = (k + 1/2)π for some integer k.\nt = (k + 1/2)π/9 = (2k+1)π/18.\nFor t ∈ [0, 2π), 2k+1 must be an integer from 1 to 35, so k ranges from 0 to 17. There are 18 such time values.\n\nAn intersection requires y(t1) = y(t2) for t1 ≠ t2 from this set.\nsin(5t1) = sin(5t2). Let t1 = (2k1+1)π/18 and t2 = (2k2+1)π/18.\nsin(5(2k1+1)π/18) = sin(5(2k2+1)π/18).\nThis holds if 5(2k2+1)π/18 = 5(2k1+1)π/18 + 2jπ or 5(2k2+1)π/18 = π - 5(2k1+1)π/18 + 2jπ.\nThe first case leads to 5(k2-k1) = 18j, which implies k2-k1 is a multiple of 18, impossible for distinct k1,k2 in {0,...,17}.\nThe second case leads to 5(2k2+1) = 18 - 5(2k1+1) + 36j, which simplifies to 5(k1+k2+1) = 9(1+2j).\nSince 5 and 9 are coprime, k1+k2+1 must be a multiple of 9. Let k1+k2+1 = 9λ. For 5(9λ) = 9(1+2j), we have 5λ = 1+2j, meaning λ must be odd.\nk1, k2 are in {0, ..., 17}. So k1+k2+1 is in {2, ..., 35}.\nPossible values for k1+k2+1 that are odd multiples of 9 are 9 and 27.\n*   Case 3.1: k1+k2+1 = 9 => k1+k2 = 8. Pairs {k1, k2} with k1<k2 are {0, 8}, {1, 7}, {2, 6}, {3, 5}. (4 pairs).\n*   Case 3.2: k1+k2+1 = 27 => k1+k2 = 26. Pairs {k1, k2} with k1<k2 are {9, 17}, {10, 16}, {11, 15}, {12, 14}. (4 pairs).\nIn total, we have 4+4=8 pairs of times. Each pair corresponds to a unique y-value.\nFor k1+k2=8, the y-values are all positive. For k1+k2=26, the y-values are all negative. For example, for {0,8}, y = sin(5π/18). For {9,17}, y = sin(5(19)π/18) = sin(95π/18) = -sin(5π/18).\nThese 8 pairs of times result in 8 distinct self-intersection points on the y-axis.\n\n### Step 4: Find Intersections not on the Axes\nFor a Lissajous curve x(t) = cos(nt), y(t) = sin(mt) with n and m being coprime odd integers, the number of self-intersection points that do not lie on the axes is given by a known formula:\nNumber of off-axis intersections = (n-1)(m-1)/2.\nFor n=9 and m=5:\nNumber = (9-1)(5-1)/2 = (8)(4)/2 = 16.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Self-Intersection Points\nThe total number of self-intersection points is the sum of the points found in each region.\nTotal = (Points on x-axis) + (Points on y-axis) + (Points not on axes)\nTotal = 4 + 8 + 16 = 28."
