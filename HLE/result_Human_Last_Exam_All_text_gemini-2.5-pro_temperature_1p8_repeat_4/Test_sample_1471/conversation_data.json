    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Roman Numerals**\n\nFirst, we need to convert each Roman numeral in the equation into its modern (Arabic) number equivalent.\n\n*   **XXIV**:\n    *   `XX` represents 10 + 10 = 20.\n    *   `IV` represents 5 - 1 = 4.\n    *   Therefore, `XXIV` is 20 + 4 = **24**.\n*   **CCC**:\n    *   `C` represents 100.\n    *   `CCC` represents 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**.\n*   **CXXXIII**:\n    *   `C` represents 100.\n    *   `XXX` represents 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n    *   `III` represents 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    *   Therefore, `CXXXIII` is 100 + 30 + 3 = **133**.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the Equation with Modern Numbers**\n\nNow, we replace the Roman numerals in the original equation with the modern numbers we just found.\n\nOriginal equation: `XXIV / CCC - CXXXIII = ?`\nNew equation: `24 / 300 - 133 = ?`\n\n**Step 3: Follow the Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)**\n\nThe order of operations dictates that we must perform division before subtraction.\n\n*   **Part A: Division**\n    *   We first calculate `24 / 300`.\n    *   `24 ÷ 300 = 0.08`\n*   **Part B: Subtraction**\n    *   Next, we take the result from the division and subtract 133.\n    *   `0.08 - 133`\n    *   The result is **-132.92**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Accurate Conversion:** Ensure each Roman numeral is converted correctly, paying attention to both additive (`VI`=6) and subtractive (`IV`=4) rules.\n*   **Order of Operations:** It is crucial to perform the division (`24 / 300`) *before* the subtraction. A common mistake would be to subtract first (`300 - 133`), which would yield an incorrect result.\n*   **Decimal and Negative Numbers:** The calculation results in a decimal value from the division, and the final answer is a negative number.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\n1.  Equation: `XXIV / CCC - CXXXIII`\n2.  Conversion to modern numbers: `24 / 300 - 133`\n3.  Perform division: `0.08 - 133`\n4.  Perform subtraction: `-132.92`\n\n<<<-132.92>>>"
