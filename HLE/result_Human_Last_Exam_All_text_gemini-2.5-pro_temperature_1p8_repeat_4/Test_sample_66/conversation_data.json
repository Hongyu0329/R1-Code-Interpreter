    "Answering this question requires us to model the flag of Tonga as a matrix, and then use linear algebra to find its maximal possible rank. The maximal rank will depend on our choices for the pixel resolution of the image and the values $a$ and $b$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Flag of Tonga and the corresponding matrix:**\n    *   The flag of Tonga is predominantly red. It features a white canton (a rectangle in the top-left corner).\n    *   Inside the white canton, there is a red \"couped cross\" (meaning it does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n    *   Let's represent an image of this flag as an $m \\times n$ matrix, $M$. Each red pixel corresponds to a matrix entry with value $a$, and each white pixel corresponds to an entry with value $b$.\n    *   To maximize the rank, we should assume $a$ and $b$ are distinct, i.e., $a \\neq b$. If $a=b$, the matrix would be constant, having a rank of 1 (or 0 if $a=b=0$). This is unlikely to be the maximum.\n\n2.  **Express the matrix $M$ in a structured form:**\n    *   Let's choose $a$ and $b$ such that $a \\neq b$ and $a \\neq 0$. The matrix $M$ can be written as the sum of two matrices:\n        $M = aJ + (b-a)M_W$\n        where:\n        *   $J$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix with all entries equal to 1. The rank of $aJ$ is 1 (since $a \\neq 0$).\n        *   $M_W$ is an $m \\times n$ matrix where white pixels are 1 and red pixels are 0. Thus, $M_W$ has 1s only in the canton background area (the white part), and 0s everywhere else (the red field and the red cross).\n\n3.  **Relate the rank of $M$ to the rank of its components:**\n    *   The column space of $M$ is contained in the sum of the column spaces of $aJ$ and $(b-a)M_W$.\n    *   The column space of $aJ$ is spanned by the single vector $\\mathbf{1} = (1, 1, ..., 1)^T$.\n    *   So, the column space of $M$ is spanned by the union of the columns of $M_W$ and the vector $\\mathbf{1}$.\n    *   Thus, $\\text{rank}(M) = \\dim(\\text{span}(\\text{Col}(M_W) \\cup \\{\\mathbf{1}\\} ))$.\n    *   The matrix $M_W$ is zero outside the canton. As the flag has a red field outside the canton, any column of $M_W$ will have zero entries for rows corresponding to the area outside the canton. The vector $\\mathbf{1}$ has non-zero entries (1s) everywhere. Therefore, $\\mathbf{1}$ cannot be in the column space of $M_W$.\n    *   This means the rank of $M$ is $\\text{rank}(M) = \\text{rank}(M_W) + 1$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the rank of $M_W$:**\n    *   $M_W$ has non-zero entries only in its top-left submatrix corresponding to the canton. Let's call this submatrix $C_W$.\n    *   The rank of $M_W$ is therefore equal to the rank of $C_W$. So, $\\text{rank}(M) = \\text{rank}(C_W) + 1$.\n    *   $C_W$ represents the canton: it has 1s for the white background and 0s for the red cross. We can write $C_W = J' - C_R$, where $J'$ is the all-ones matrix of the canton's size, and $C_R$ is a matrix with 1s for the red cross pixels and 0s for the white background pixels.\n    *   Following a similar logic as before, $\\text{rank}(C_W) = \\text{rank}(J' - C_R) = \\dim(\\text{span}(\\text{Col}(C_R) \\cup \\{\\mathbf{1'}\\} ))$.\n    *   The cross is \"couped,\" so it doesn't touch the canton's edges. This means the matrix $C_R$ has at least one all-zero row at the top/bottom and one all-zero column at the left/right. Consequently, any vector in the column space of $C_R$ must have zero entries in those border rows. The vector $\\mathbf{1'}$ (all ones) does not have these zero entries.\n    *   Therefore, $\\mathbf{1'}$ is not in the column space of $C_R$.\n    *   This leads to $\\text{rank}(C_W) = \\text{rank}(C_R) + 1$.\n\n5.  **Combine results and maximize the rank of $C_R$:**\n    *   Substituting back, we get the central relationship:\n        $\\text{rank}(M) = \\text{rank}(C_W) + 1 = (\\text{rank}(C_R) + 1) + 1 = \\text{rank}(C_R) + 2$.\n    *   To maximize $\\text{rank}(M)$, we need to maximize $\\text{rank}(C_R)$.\n    *   $C_R$ is a binary matrix whose non-zero entries form the shape of a cross. A cross is fundamentally the union of two overlapping rectangles (a horizontal bar and a vertical bar).\n    *   Let's analyze the row structure of $C_R$. We can construct the cross in such a way that it produces three distinct, linearly independent types of non-zero rows, by making the rectangles for the two bars partially overlap in both their row and column spans.\n        *   **Type 1:** Rows that are only part of the horizontal bar.\n        *   **Type 2:** Rows that are only part of the vertical bar.\n        *   **Type 3:** Rows that are part of the intersection of both bars.\n    *   By selecting appropriate pixel dimensions, we can ensure these three row types exist and are linearly independent. For example: let the horizontal bar occupy rows 10-20 and columns 10-30. Let the vertical bar occupy rows 15-25 and columns 20-40. This creates regions for all three row types, and it can be shown they are linearly independent over real numbers.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible rank of the cross matrix $C_R$ is 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe maximal possible rank of the matrix $M$ is $\\text{rank}(C_R) + 2$. Since the maximal rank of $C_R$ is 3, the maximal rank of the matrix $M$ representing the flag of Tonga is $3 + 2 = 5$. This maximum is achieved when $a \\neq b$ and $a \\neq 0$. For instance, we could choose $a=1, b=0$ or $a=2, b=1$."
