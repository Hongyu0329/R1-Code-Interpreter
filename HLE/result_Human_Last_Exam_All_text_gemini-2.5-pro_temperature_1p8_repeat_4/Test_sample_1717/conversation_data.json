    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.**\n\n*   According to the Terraria source code (and confirmed by the official wiki), the Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Classic Mode is 2,800.\n*   When a world is in Expert Mode, most boss health values are increased. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the source code applies a multiplier of 1.3 to its Classic Mode health.\n*   Calculation: `2,800 (Classic Health) * 1.3 = 3,640`.\n*   So, the base health for a single player in Expert Mode is **3,640 HP**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the multiplayer health scaling formula for Expert Mode.**\n\n*   In Terraria's Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player in the game to provide a suitable challenge. This is handled by a specific per-player scaling factor.\n*   The source code defines a variable, `bossLifePerPlayerInExpert`, which dictates this scaling. For the Eye of Cthulhu, this value is set to `0.35f`, which represents a 35% health increase for each player after the first.\n*   The general formula for health scaling is:\n    `Total Health = Base Health * (1 + (Scaling Factor * (Number of Players - 1)))`\n*   Plugging in the values for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, where `N` is the number of players:\n    `Total Health = 3,640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formula with an infinite number of players.**\n\n*   The question asks for the *theoretical maximum health* given an *infinite number of players*. This requires us to find the limit of the health formula as `N` approaches infinity (`N → ∞`).\n*   First, let's simplify the health formula:\n    `Total Health = 3,640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n    `Total Health = 3,640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n*   Now, we can expand this expression:\n    `Total Health = (3,640 * 0.65) + (3,640 * 0.35 * N)`\n    `Total Health = 2,366 + 1,274N`\n*   This equation shows that the Eye of Cthulhu's health is a linear function of the number of players, `N`. For every additional player, its health increases by 1,274.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the theoretical maximum.**\n\n*   We need to evaluate the limit of the function `f(N) = 2366 + 1274N` as `N` approaches infinity.\n*   `lim (N→∞) (2366 + 1274N)`\n*   Since the `1274N` term increases without bound as `N` increases, the entire expression also increases without bound.\n*   Therefore, the limit is infinity.\n\n**Careful Points Considered:**\n\n*   **Practical Player Limit:** A standard Terraria server has a player limit (e.g., 255). However, the question specifies a \"theoretical\" scenario with \"infinite\" players, so this practical limit must be disregarded.\n*   **Data Type Limit:** The game stores health as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`), which has a maximum value of 2,147,483,647. While the health value in the game cannot exceed this, the question is about the *theoretical* maximum according to the game's scaling *formula*. The formula itself does not include a cap, so its theoretical limit is not bound by data types.\n*   **Spatial Limit:** The source code reveals that players must be within a certain distance (350 tiles) of the boss when it spawns to be counted for health scaling. The premise of \"infinite players\" implies we assume an infinite number of players can meet this condition, as we are testing the formula itself, not its practical application within the game world's spatial constraints.\n\nConclusion: The health scaling formula for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is linear and unbounded. Given an infinite number of players, its theoretical health would also be infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
