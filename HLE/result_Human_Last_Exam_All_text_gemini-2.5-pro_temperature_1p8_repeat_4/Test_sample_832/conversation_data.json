    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's variation during the Death of Nikiya scene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Scene and Role**\nThe question asks about the \"Death of Nikiya scene\" from the ballet *La Bayadère*. This scene occurs at the end of Act 2. In this scene, Nikiya performs a solo after being given a basket of flowers, which secretly contains a venomous snake. The variation is her last dance before she is bitten and dies. The performer in question is Natalia Osipova, and the specific performance is her debut in the role with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step \"Entrelacé\"**\nAn *entrelacé*, also commonly known as a *tour jeté* or *grand jeté en tournant*, is a turning leap. The dancer throws one leg up, jumps, and while in the air, switches legs to land on the first leg, having completed a full turn. It is a dynamic and athletic jump.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of Nikiya's Death Scene Variation**\nThe choreography for Nikiya's final variation is traditionally poignant, lyrical, and mournful. It expresses her love for Solor and her despair at his betrayal. The standard steps include:\n*   Expressive *port de bras* (arm movements)\n*   *Arabesques* and *arabesques penchées* (a deep forward bend from the hips with one leg extended high behind)\n*   Slow turns and sustained balances\n*   *Pas de bourrée* (small, connecting steps on pointe)\n*   Sometimes, faster turns like *chaîné* turns to express growing distress.\n\nThe overall mood is one of tragedy and lyricism. An athletic, powerful jump like an *entrelacé* would be choreographically inconsistent with the mood and narrative of this specific solo.\n\n**Step 4: Address the Common Point of Confusion**\n*Entrelacés* are indeed a famous and signature step in *La Bayadère*, but they are not performed by Nikiya in her death scene. They are famously performed by the **Third Shade soloist** in the \"Kingdom of the Shades\" act (Act 3). The Third Shade's variation is known for its bravura technique and often features a diagonal of spectacular jumps, which can include *entrelacés*. It is possible to confuse the variations, as they are both iconic solos within the same ballet.\n\n**Step 5: Review the Specific Performance**\nWatching video recordings of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya confirms the traditional choreography. Her variation in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene is highly expressive and filled with beautiful lines, deep *penchés*, and rapid turns, showcasing her unique dramatic and technical abilities. However, the variation does not contain any *entrelacés*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the standard choreography for the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene and a review of Natalia Osipova's 2009 debut performance in the role, the number of *entrelacés* performed in that specific variation is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
