    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A fundamental ballet movement where the upper body bends backward from the waist. \"Cambré\" means \"arched,\" and \"derrière\" means \"to the back.\"\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet technique developed by Agrippina Vaganova. It is known for its precision, strength, epaulement (the stylized turning of the shoulders and head), and the logical, step-by-step progression of training. The emphasis is on the harmonious coordination of the entire body.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** A neoclassical ballet technique developed by George Balanchine. It is characterized by speed, musicality, dynamic movement, extended lines, and often an \"off-balance\" aesthetic. It pushes the boundaries of classical form.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Movement (Cambré Derrière) in Each Method**\n\n*   **Vaganova Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Principle:** Stability and control. The bend should originate from the upper back, lifting the sternum up towards the ceiling before arching back.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** This is a crucial point. The Vaganova method strictly requires the hips to remain absolutely square to the front. The pelvis does not shift or press forward. This isolates the bend in the spine and relies on spinal flexibility and core strength.\n    *   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine and arm, looking up and back. The arms (port de bras) are executed with precision and follow specific pathways.\n    *   **Aesthetic:** Clean, controlled, and demonstrating strength in the back and core.\n\n*   **Balanchine Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Principle:** Creating a dramatic, extended line and dynamic visual effect.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** This is the most significant point of difference. In the Balanchine style, the dancer is taught to release the hip of the supporting leg, allowing it to press forward. This shifting of the hip breaks the square alignment of the pelvis.\n    *   **Consequence of Hip Placement:** By releasing the hip, the dancer can achieve a much deeper and more extreme backbend. It creates a sweeping, swooping line through the body.\n    *   **Aesthetic:** Dramatic, expansive, and emphasizes speed and an off-balance quality.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on the Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in arm carriage (e.g., Balanchine's characteristic \"broken\" wrists), the fundamental difference in the cambré itself is not primarily the arm placement.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core, defining technical difference. Vaganova insists on square hips for stability. Balanchine uses a released, forward-pressed hip to create a deeper bend and a specific aesthetic.\n*   **C. Speed:** Balanchine's style is often faster, but speed is a quality of performance, not a fundamental difference in the physical placement or alignment of the body parts. A cambré in either style can be performed at various speeds.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The greater degree of backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the released hip. The hip placement is the cause; the depth of the bend is the effect. Therefore, hip placement is the more fundamental difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head follows the general line of the movement. While there might be subtle stylistic nuances, it is not the primary distinguishing factor compared to the stark contrast in hip alignment.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most significant and technically fundamental difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement of the hips. Vaganova maintains a square pelvis, while Balanchine allows the hip to release forward.\n\n<<<B>>>"
