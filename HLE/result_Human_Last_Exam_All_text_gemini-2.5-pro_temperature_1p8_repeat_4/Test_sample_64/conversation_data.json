    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Pronunciation:** The kanji is 「弟」, and its standard pronunciation is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Morae:** The word 「おとうと」 is composed of four morae (音拍, onpaku), which are the units of timing in Japanese phonology. The morae are:\n    *   お (o)\n    *   と (to)\n    *   う (u) - This is a long vowel sound extending the 'o' of 'to', making one mora.\n    *   と (to)\n    So, it's a four-mora word: お-と-う-と.\n\n3.  **Determine the Standard Pitch Accent Pattern:** The standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect) pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is as follows:\n    *   The first mora (お) is pronounced with a **low** pitch.\n    *   The pitch **rises** for the second mora (と).\n    *   The third mora (う) stays at a **high** pitch.\n    *   The pitch **falls** for the fourth mora (と).\n    This creates a pattern of **Low-High-High-Low** (低高高低).\n\n4.  **Match the Pattern to the Categories:** Now, let's compare this L-H-H-L pattern to the given answer choices:\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then remains high for the rest of the word and any following particle (e.g., L-H-H-H). This does not match.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and low for all subsequent morae (H-L-L-L). This does not match.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *somewhere in the middle of the word* (i.e., not after the first mora and not after the last mora). For 「おとうと」, the pitch falls from the third mora (う) to the fourth mora (と). Since the fall happens *within* the word, this is the correct classification.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高):** The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high until the last mora of the word. The fall occurs on the particle that follows (e.g., L-H-H-H for the word itself, with the following particle being low). This does not match, as the pitch falls on the last mora of the word itself.\n    *   **E. Heiban or Nakadaka:** Since the pattern is definitively Nakadaka, this choice is incorrect.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's crucial to distinguish between morae and syllables. Pitch accent applies to morae.\n*   The \"standard\" accent refers to the Tokyo dialect, which is taught as the norm in language learning.\n*   The defining characteristic of Nakadaka accent is the pitch fall occurring *within* the word itself, on a mora other than the first. In the case of おとうと [3], the fall happens after the 3rd mora.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Low-High-High-Low, which is a classic example of the **Nakadaka** pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>"
