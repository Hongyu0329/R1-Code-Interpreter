    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines with the equation px+qy=1, where p and q are coprime integers.\n\n### Step 1: Formalize the problem\nLet K be a convex domain in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nLet L be the set of lines given by $L_{p,q} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid px+qy=1\\}$, where p and q are coprime integers (i.e., $\\gcd(p,q)=1$). We denote the set of such integer pairs (p,q) as $Z_{prim}^2$.\nThe condition is that K has a non-empty intersection with every line in L: $K \\cap L_{p,q} \\neq \\emptyset$ for all $(p,q) \\in Z_{prim}^2$.\nWe want to find the minimum possible area of such a convex domain K.\n\n### Step 2: Argue that the optimal domain can be assumed to be centrally symmetric\nThe set of lines L is centrally symmetric. If a line $L: px+qy=1$ is in L, then the line $L': (-p)x+(-q)y=1$, which simplifies to $px+qy=-1$, is also in L because $\\gcd(-p,-q) = \\gcd(p,q)=1$.\n\nLet K be any convex set that satisfies the condition. For any $(p,q) \\in Z_{prim}^2$, K must intersect both $px+qy=1$ and $px+qy=-1$. Let $n=(p,q)$ be the normal vector to the line. The condition for K to intersect $n \\cdot x = c$ is $\\inf_{z \\in K} (n \\cdot z) \\le c \\le \\sup_{z \\in K} (n \\cdot z)$.\nLet $h_K(n) = \\sup_{z \\in K} (n \\cdot z)$ be the support function of K. Then $\\inf_{z \\in K} (n \\cdot z) = -h_K(-n)$.\nSo, for K to intersect $px+qy=1$, we need $-h_K(-n) \\le 1 \\le h_K(n)$. This gives $h_K(n) \\ge 1$ and $h_K(-n) \\ge -1$.\nFor K to intersect $px+qy=-1$, we need $-h_K(-n) \\le -1 \\le h_K(n)$. This gives $h_K(n) \\ge -1$ and $h_K(-n) \\ge 1$.\nCombining these for all $(p,q) \\in Z_{prim}^2$, we must have $h_K(n) \\ge 1$ and $h_K(-n) \\ge 1$ for all $n=(p,q) \\in Z_{prim}^2$.\n\nNow, consider the Minkowski symmetrization of K, which is $K_s = \\frac{1}{2}(K - K) = \\frac{1}{2}\\{k_1 - k_2 \\mid k_1, k_2 \\in K\\}$.\n$K_s$ is a centrally symmetric convex set. Its support function is $h_{K_s}(n) = \\frac{1}{2}(h_K(n) + h_K(-n))$.\nUsing the conditions derived above, $h_{K_s}(n) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}(1+1) = 1$.\nThis is the condition for a centrally symmetric set to intersect all lines $px+qy=\\pm1$. Thus, $K_s$ also satisfies the required intersection property.\n\nBy the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, $\\text{Area}(K_s) \\ge \\text{Area}(K)$. Equality holds if and only if K is centrally symmetric. This means that if a solution K is not centrally symmetric, its symmetrization $K_s$ is also a solution and has a larger or equal area. Therefore, the minimum area must be achieved by a centrally symmetric convex domain.\n\n### Step 3: Reformulate the problem for centrally symmetric domains\nFor a centrally symmetric convex domain K, the condition to intersect all lines $px+qy=1$ and $px+qy=-1$ simplifies to $h_K(p,q) \\ge 1$ for all $(p,q) \\in Z_{prim}^2$.\nOur goal is to find the minimum area of a centrally symmetric convex set K satisfying this condition.\n\n### Step 4: Use Polar Duality\nLet K* be the polar dual of K. For a centrally symmetric convex body K containing the origin, its polar is defined as $K^* = \\{u \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid u \\cdot x \\le 1 \\text{ for all } x \\in K\\}$.\nThe support function of K is related to K* by the gauge function: $h_K(u) = \\inf\\{\\lambda > 0 \\mid u \\in \\lambda K^*\\}$.\nThe condition $h_K(p,q) \\ge 1$ for all $(p,q) \\in Z_{prim}^2$ translates to:\n$\\inf\\{\\lambda > 0 \\mid (p,q) \\in \\lambda K^*\\} \\ge 1$.\nThis means that for any $\\lambda < 1$, $(p,q) \\notin \\lambda K^*$. The union of all $\\lambda K^*$ for $0 \\le \\lambda < 1$ is the interior of K*, denoted $\\text{int}(K^*)$.\nSo, the condition on K is equivalent to the condition that no primitive integer vector $(p,q)$ lies in the interior of K*:\n$\\text{int}(K^*) \\cap Z_{prim}^2 = \\emptyset$.\n\n### Step 5: Find the K* with maximum area\nTo minimize Area(K), we need to maximize Area(K*). This is a consequence of the Blaschke-SantalÃ³ inequality, which states that for centrally symmetric convex bodies in the plane, Area(K)Area(K*) $\\ge \\pi^2/12$. More directly, we seek the K with minimum area whose polar K* satisfies the derived property. To make K as \"small\" as possible, its polar K* must be as \"large\" as possible.\nSo the problem becomes: Find the maximum area of a centrally symmetric convex body $K^*$ whose interior does not contain any primitive integer points.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the largest such K*\nThe set of primitive integer points $Z_{prim}^2$ includes $(\\pm 1, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm 1)$.\nSince these four points cannot be in the interior of $K^*$, any such set $K^*$ must be contained within the square defined by the vertices $(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)$. This is the square $Q = [-1,1] \\times [-1,1]$.\nTherefore, $\\text{Area}(K^*) \\le \\text{Area}(Q) = 4$.\n\nNow we check if the square $Q$ itself is a valid candidate for $K^*$.\n1.  Q is a centrally symmetric convex body.\n2.  Its interior is $\\text{int}(Q) = (-1,1) \\times (-1,1)$. The only integer point in this open square is $(0,0)$. The pair $(0,0)$ is not a primitive integer pair (as $\\gcd(0,0)$ is not 1), so it is not in $Z_{prim}^2$.\nThus, $\\text{int}(Q)$ is free of primitive integer points.\nThis means that the square $Q = [-1,1] \\times [-1,1]$ is indeed the centrally symmetric convex body of maximal area whose interior contains no primitive integer points. The maximal area is 4.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the minimal area domain K\nThe domain K with minimal area is the polar dual of this maximal-area body $K^*=Q$.\n$K = Q^* = ([-1,1] \\times [-1,1])^*$.\n$K = \\{(x,y) \\mid ux+vy \\le 1 \\text{ for all } (u,v) \\in Q \\}$.\nSince $u,v \\in [-1,1]$, the supremum of $ux+vy$ over Q is $|x|+|y|$.\nSo, the polar dual is the set $K = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid |x|+|y| \\le 1\\}$.\nThis is a square with vertices at $(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)$.\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the area of K\nThe resulting domain K is a square with diagonals of length 2. The area can be calculated as half the product of the lengths of the diagonals.\nArea(K) = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nThe minimal area is 2."
