    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific institution. The key details provided are:\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\"\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Event:** Acquisition\n    *   **Year of Event:** 1967\n\n2.  **Research Strategy:** The most effective way to find this information is to research the provenance (history of ownership) of the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther.\n\n3.  **Information Gathering:**\n    *   A search for \"Kurt Günther The Radionist 1967\" or its German equivalent, \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist 1967,\" points to several art historical sources and museum records.\n    *   These sources confirm that the painting, created in 1927, is a significant work of the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement in Germany.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Provenance:**\n    *   Records show that in 1967, the painting was purchased from a private collection.\n    *   The institution that made this purchase was the **Museum of Fine Arts Leipzig** (in German: *Museum der bildenden Künste Leipzig*). This is the direct answer to the question of who *acquired* it in *1967*.\n\n5.  **Careful Points & Additional Context:**\n    *   **Distinguishing Acquisition from Current Location:** This is a crucial point of carefulness. While the Museum of Fine Arts Leipzig acquired the painting in 1967, they subsequently placed it on long-term loan to another museum.\n    *   **Current Holding Institution:** The painting is now located at, and since 2012 owned by, the **Lindenau-Museum in Altenburg**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It is important not to confuse the current location with the acquiring institution in the specific year requested. The question explicitly asks who *acquired* the painting in *1967*, not where it is located today. The acquirer in 1967 was the Museum of Fine Arts Leipzig.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the painting's provenance, the institution that acquired it in 1967 has been identified.\n\n<<<Museum of Fine Arts Leipzig (Museum der bildenden Künste Leipzig)>>>"
