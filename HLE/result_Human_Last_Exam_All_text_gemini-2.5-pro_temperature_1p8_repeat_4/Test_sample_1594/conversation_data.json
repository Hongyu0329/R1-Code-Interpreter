    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the two high school buildings.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Schools and Location:** The question specifies two high schools in Pisa, Italy: Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini. It mentions they are located next to each other.\n2.  **Use a Map Service:** To see the buildings from above, we need to use a service like Google Maps or a similar satellite imagery provider.\n3.  **Locate the Buildings:** A search for \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti Pisa\" on a map service shows its location on Via Benedetto Croce. Right next to it, as the question states, is the \"Liceo Scientifico Statale 'Ulisse Dini'\".\n4.  **Switch to Satellite View:** By switching to the satellite or aerial view, we can see the actual shape of the buildings' rooftops.\n5.  **Analyze the Shapes:**\n    *   The **Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti** building is a long, straight, rectangular structure. This will form the main vertical part of the letter.\n    *   The **Istituto Ulisse Dini** building is adjacent to it. It has a central corridor with two distinct wings extending outwards in the same direction. These wings are perpendicular to the Galilei-Pacinotti building.\n6.  **Combine the Shapes:** When viewed as a single complex, the long, straight Galilei-Pacinotti building forms the vertical stroke of a letter. The two wings of the Ulisse Dini building form two horizontal strokes extending from the vertical one.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Perspective is Key:** The question explicitly states \"if seen from above,\" which makes satellite imagery the correct tool for analysis.\n*   **Both Buildings Matter:** The shape is not formed by one school alone but by the combination of the two adjacent buildings.\n*   **Building Orientation:** The way the buildings are positioned relative to each other is crucial. The Galilei-Pacinotti building acts as the 'backbone', and the Dini building provides the 'arms'.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of the long vertical building (Galilei-Pacinotti) and the two horizontal wings (Ulisse Dini) clearly forms the shape of a capital letter. This letter is the letter 'F'.\n\n<<<F>>>"
