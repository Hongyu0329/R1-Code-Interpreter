    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix:\n\\[ H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThe factorization should be in the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n\nFor this to be a left coprime factorization, the following conditions must be met:\n*   $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be stable and proper rational transfer function matrices. (All poles in the open left-half plane, and the degree of the denominator is greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator for each element).\n*   $D(s)$ must be invertible, meaning $\\det(D(s))$ is not identically zero.\n*   $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be left coprime. This means that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane (including $s=\\infty$). This is equivalent to the existence of stable and proper matrices $X(s)$ and $Y(s)$ such that the Bezout identity $D(s)X(s) + N(s)Y(s) = I$ holds.\n\n**2. Identify the Instability**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the poles of $H(s)$:\n*   $H_{11}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$: Pole at $s=-1$ (stable).\n*   $H_{12}(s) = 1$: No poles.\n*   $H_{21}(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$: Poles at $s=1$ (unstable) and $s=-1$ (stable).\n*   $H_{22}(s) = 0$: No poles.\n\nThe overall system is unstable due to the pole at $s=1$. Our factorization must handle this unstable pole.\n\n**3. Construct the Factorization**\n\nThe relation $H = D^{-1}N$ is equivalent to $DH=N$. We need to find a suitable $D(s)$ such that when it multiplies $H(s)$, the resulting matrix $N(s)$ is stable.\n\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is:\n\\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be stable, we must eliminate the pole at $s=1$. This pole appears in the terms containing $\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$.\n\nLet's look at the elements of $N(s)$:\n*   $N_{11}(s)$: For this element to be stable, the residue at the pole $s=1$ must be zero. The residue is proportional to $d_{12}(1)$. Thus, we need $d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n*   $N_{21}(s)$: Similarly, for this element to be stable, the residue at the pole $s=1$ must be zero. This requires $d_{22}(1) = 0$.\n*   $N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$. These must be stable.\n\nTo satisfy the conditions $d_{12}(1)=0$ and $d_{22}(1)=0$, we can choose $d_{12}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$ to have a factor of $(s-1)$. To make them stable and proper, a simple choice is to use the stable Blaschke factor $\\frac{s-1}{s+1}$, which maps the RHP pole $s=1$ to a zero.\n\nLet's try to construct a simple $D(s)$ matrix:\n*   Choose $d_{11}(s) = 1$ and $d_{21}(s) = 0$. These are stable and proper.\n*   With $d_{21}(s)=0$, we can choose $d_{12}(s)=0$ which satisfies $d_{12}(1)=0$.\n*   We still need $d_{22}(1)=0$. Let's choose $d_{22}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$. This is stable, proper, and zero at $s=1$.\n\nThis gives us the candidate matrix for $D(s)$:\n\\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThis matrix is stable and proper as its only pole is at $s=-1$.\n\n**4. Calculate N(s)**\n\nNow we calculate $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} (1) \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (0) \\cdot \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & (1) \\cdot 1 + (0) \\cdot 0 \\\\ (0) \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (\\frac{s-1}{s+1}) \\cdot \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & (0) \\cdot 1 + (\\frac{s-1}{s+1}) \\cdot 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThe matrix $N(s)$ is stable and proper, with poles only at $s=-1$.\n\n**5. Verify Coprimeness**\n\nWe need to check that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (rank 2) for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane. The only point of concern is $s=1$, where $\\det(D(s))$ becomes zero.\n\nLet's evaluate the matrix at $s=1$:\n\\[ D(1) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\\[ N(1) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1-1}{1+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(1+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nNow form the composite matrix:\n\\[ [D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThe two rows of this matrix are linearly independent. For example, the determinant of the submatrix formed by columns 1 and 3 is $1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} - 0 \\cdot 0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\neq 0$. Therefore, the rank is 2.\n\nThe factorization satisfies all the required conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by the following matrices:\n\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$"
