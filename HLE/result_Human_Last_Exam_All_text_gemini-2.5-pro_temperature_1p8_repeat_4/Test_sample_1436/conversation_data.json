    "This problem asks for the symmetry factor of a specific Feynman diagram. The symmetry factor is a crucial combinatorial number in quantum field theory that corrects for overcounting when summing diagrams in a perturbative expansion. Let's break down the calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Diagram's Topology**\n\n*   **Vertices:** The diagram has two vertices. In a typical interacting theory like $\\phi^4$ theory ($\\mathcal{L}_{int} \\propto \\phi^4$), each vertex is a point where four field lines meet.\n*   **Field Contractions:** There are four field contractions, which correspond to four propagators (internal lines) in the diagram.\n*   **Connecting the Components:** The only way to construct a diagram with two 4-point vertices and four propagators is to have all four propagators connect the two vertices directly. Imagine two points, V1 and V2, and four separate lines drawn between them. This is a type of vacuum bubble diagram (a diagram with no external lines).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Definition of the Symmetry Factor**\n\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by `S`, is the order of the automorphism group of a given Feynman diagram. In simpler terms, it's the total number of ways you can permute the internal lines and vertices of the diagram that leaves the diagram's overall structure (its topology) unchanged.\n\nThe final contribution of a diagram in the perturbative series is proportional to `1/S`. This factor ensures that when we sum all possible Wick contractions, we don't overcount topologically identical diagrams.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Symmetries of this Specific Diagram**\n\nWe must identify all the distinct operations (permutations) that leave the diagram unchanged.\n\n*   **Symmetry from Interchanging Propagators:**\n    *   The diagram has four propagators connecting the two vertices. Since they connect the same two points and represent the same type of particle field, they are indistinguishable or topologically equivalent.\n    *   We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way, and the diagram will look exactly the same.\n    *   The number of ways to permute four distinct objects is $4!$ (4-factorial).\n    *   $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n    *   This gives a factor of **24** to our symmetry factor.\n\n*   **Symmetry from Interchanging Vertices:**\n    *   The diagram has two vertices. These vertices are of the same type (both are 4-point interaction vertices). Furthermore, their roles in the diagram are identical: each vertex is connected to the other by the same set of four lines.\n    *   Because the vertices are indistinguishable, we can swap their positions (or labels), and the diagram remains topologically invariant.\n    *   The number of ways to permute two objects is $2! = 2$.\n    *   This gives a factor of **2** to our symmetry factor.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor**\n\nThe total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the number of all independent symmetry operations.\n\n*   $S = (\\text{Number of ways to permute the identical propagators}) \\times (\\text{Number of ways to permute the identical vertices})$\n*   $S = 4! \\times 2$\n*   $S = 24 \\times 2 = 48$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Theory Context:** We have assumed a theory with a 4-point vertex, like $\\phi^4$ theory. The result depends on the structure of the vertex. The description \"two vertices and four field contractions\" fits this context perfectly.\n2.  **Internal Lines Only:** The symmetry rules apply to internal lines and vertices. External lines, if any, are considered fixed and labeled, so they cannot be permuted. The described diagram has only internal lines.\n3.  **Independence of Symmetries:** The two types of symmetries identified (permuting lines and permuting vertices) are independent operations. Therefore, the total number of symmetries is their product.\n4.  **Verification:** This result can be verified by considering the explicit terms in the Wick expansion. The term in the S-matrix expansion for this diagram would be proportional to $\\frac{1}{2!} (\\frac{\\lambda}{4!})^2$. The number of ways to form this specific diagram topology via Wick contractions is $4!$. The overall numerical factor is therefore $\\frac{1}{2!} (\\frac{1}{4!})^2 \\times (4!) = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 4!} = \\frac{1}{48}$. Since this overall factor is defined as $1/S$, this confirms that $S=48$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify Diagram:** Two vertices connected by four lines.\n2.  **Line Symmetry:** The four connecting lines are identical and can be permuted. This gives a factor of $4! = 24$.\n3.  **Vertex Symmetry:** The two vertices are identical and can be swapped. This gives a factor of $2! = 2$.\n4.  **Total Symmetry Factor:** $S = (\\text{line permutations}) \\times (\\text{vertex permutations}) = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
