    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The core elements are:\n    *   An essay's Russian translation.\n    *   A description of Vienna's wide boulevards.\n    *   The mention of an English poet's surname.\n    *   The task is to name this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the key location and feature:** The \"wide boulevards of Vienna\" most famously refers to the **Ringstrasse** (Ring Street or Ring Boulevard), a grand circular road that replaced the old city walls.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Russian translation\" clue:** This is the most crucial point. It suggests that the connection between the boulevard and the poet's name is based on the Russian language, likely a pun or a phonetic similarity. The name might not appear in the original text but is a feature of the Russian cultural interpretation or translation.\n\n4.  **Connect the location to the Russian language:**\n    *   The English word \"Ring\" (from Ringstrasse) translates to Russian as **\"кольцо\"** (pronounced \"kol'tso\").\n    *   The adjective form, \"ring-shaped\" or \"circular,\" is **\"кольцевой\"** (pronounced \"kol'tsevoy\").\n    *   Therefore, the Ringstrasse is often referred to in Russian as the **\"Кольцевой бульвар\"** (Kol'tsevoy bul'var).\n\n5.  **Search for a matching poet's surname:** The next step is to find a famous English poet whose surname sounds like the Russian word for \"ring,\" **\"кольцо\" (kol'tso)**.\n    *   Let's consider the surname of the English Romantic poet Samuel Taylor **Coleridge**.\n    *   When transliterated into Russian, \"Coleridge\" is written as **\"Кольридж\"** (pronounced \"Kol'ridzh\").\n\n6.  **Identify the pun:** The phonetic similarity between the beginning of the poet's name, **\"Кольридж\" (Kol'ridzh)**, and the Russian word for \"ring,\" **\"кольцо\" (kol'tso)**, is very strong. This led to a well-known literary pun or witticism among Russian émigrés in the 1920s, especially in Vienna and Berlin. They jokingly referred to the Ringstrasse (\"Кольцевой бульвар\") as **\"Бульвар Кольриджа\"** (Coleridge's Boulevard). This specific observation is famously mentioned in the works of the Russian writer and literary theorist Viktor Shklovsky, particularly in his epistolary novel \"Zoo, or Letters Not About Love,\" which fits the description of \"a certain essay.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The connection is not literal (i.e., the boulevard was not named after the poet). It is a linguistic pun specific to the Russian language.\n*   The emphasis on \"Russian translation\" is the key to solving the riddle, pointing away from a direct historical fact and towards a cultural/linguistic one.\n*   The \"certain essay\" is most likely a work from the Russian émigré literary circle of the early 20th century, where such witty observations were common.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the phonetic pun between the Russian word for \"ring\" (\"кольцо\") and the Russian transliteration of the poet's name (\"Кольридж\"), the English poet whose surname appears in descriptions of Vienna's Ring Boulevard is Coleridge.\n\n<<<Coleridge>>>"
