    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe question asks for a specific novel based on two key pieces of information attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n*   **A quote describing the novel:** It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **A description of the author:** The author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**2. Analyze the Author Description:**\n*   **\"Continuator... of Faulkner\":** This points to an author who works in the literary tradition of William Faulkner. Faulkner is renowned for his creation of a complex, self-contained fictional world (Yoknapatawpha County), his use of multiple perspectives, non-linear timelines, and long, intricate sentences to explore themes of history, memory, and decay in the American South.\n*   **\"(and simplifier)\":** This is a crucial modifier. It suggests that while the author uses Faulknerian techniques, their style is more accessible or less convoluted than Faulkner's famously dense prose.\n*   **Connecting the dots:** This description is famously applied to the Colombian author **Gabriel García Márquez**. García Márquez openly acknowledged Faulkner as a major influence. His creation of the mythical town of Macondo is a direct parallel to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha. He explores multi-generational sagas and complex timelines, but his prose, while rich and imaginative, is generally considered more fluid and readable than Faulkner's. Therefore, the author is almost certainly Gabriel García Márquez.\n\n**3. Analyze the Quote about the Novel:**\nNow that we have identified the likely author, we must see if the quote fits his most famous work. The novel in question would be **_One Hundred Years of Solitude_** (*Cien años de soledad*).\n*   **\"the intensity of a tiger\":** This phrase evokes a sense of ferocity, raw power, passion, and violence. *One Hundred Years of Solitude* is filled with such intensity. It chronicles civil wars, a massacre of striking workers, passionate and often tragic love affairs, plagues, and characters driven by immense, consuming obsessions. The narrative is anything but tame; it is a whirlwind of epic human drama.\n*   **\"the variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This points to intellectual complexity, meticulous structure, and strategic depth. A chess game has a finite set of rules but a near-infinite variety of possible games. This perfectly describes the structure of *One Hundred Years of Solitude*. The novel follows the Buendía family through multiple generations in a seemingly sprawling, chaotic history. However, it is built on a highly intricate, cyclical structure where names, traits, and destinies repeat. The entire story is revealed at the end to have been written down in advance on Melquíades' parchments, reinforcing this sense of a complex, pre-determined, and perfectly orchestrated game that we are only seeing unfold. The combination of magical events and rigid, deterministic structure is a hallmark of the book.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe description of the author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a classic assessment of Gabriel García Márquez. The description of a novel that combines the visceral power of a tiger with the intricate, strategic structure of a chess game is a perfect encapsulation of his masterpiece, *One Hundred Years of Solitude*. Borges, a master of labyrinthine plots and intellectual conceits, would have recognized and admired the novel's complex architecture beneath its magical and passionate surface.\n\n***\n\n<<<The novel is *One Hundred Years of Solitude* by Gabriel García Márquez.>>>"
