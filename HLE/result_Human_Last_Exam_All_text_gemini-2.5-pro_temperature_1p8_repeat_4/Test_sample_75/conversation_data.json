    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"\nThe \"Second Great War\" is the name given to the galaxy-wide conflict that takes place during the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*) and its epilogue, *Into the Void*. The primary antagonist and instigator of this war is the fallen Xel'naga, Amon.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Start Date of the War\nThe war begins with the sudden and massive renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, specifically targeting Dominion worlds. This is the inciting incident of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to official lore, game manuals, and timelines, this event occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the End Date of the War\nThis is the most crucial point for an accurate calculation. The end of the war can be interpreted in two ways:\n*   **End of the Main Campaign:** The main campaign of *Legacy of the Void* concludes with the Protoss reclamation of their homeworld, Aiur, and the destruction of Amon's physical host body. This happens in the year **2506**. However, Amon himself is not defeated; his spirit is merely banished back to the Void.\n*   **End of the Overarching Conflict:** The true end of the war comes with the final, permanent defeat of its architect, Amon. This happens in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, where Kerrigan, Raynor, and Artanis lead a joint force into the Void to destroy Amon's essence. Official timelines and in-game lore place these events in the year **2508**. This is considered the definitive end of the Second Great War.\n\nFor a complete answer, we must use the definitive end date of the conflict, which is the defeat of the main antagonist.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Duration\nWith the start and end dates established, we can calculate the duration of the war.\n*   **Start Year:** 2504\n*   **End Year:** 2508\n\nThe war begins at some point in 2504 and ends at some point in 2508. The exact duration in days is not specified, but the conflict spans a period of roughly 4 years (e.g., from mid-2504 to mid-2508 would be exactly 4 years; from early 2504 to early 2508 would also be 4 years). If the events started in mid-2504 and ended in early 2508, the duration would be approximately 3.5 years.\n\n### Step 5: Round Up as Requested\nThe question explicitly asks for the duration to be \"rounded up\" to the nearest year.\n*   If the duration is exactly 4 years, rounding up gives 4.\n*   If the duration is between 3 and 4 years (e.g., 3.5 years), rounding up gives 4.\n\nTherefore, the final duration, when rounded up, is 4 years.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Defining the War's Scope:** It is critical to recognize that the war is against Amon, not just his forces in the Koprulu sector. Therefore, the epilogue where Amon is truly defeated must be considered the war's end.\n*   **Official Timeline:** The years 2504 (start) and 2508 (end) are based on the official Blizzard-sanctioned lore and timeline for the *StarCraft* universe.\n*   **Rounding Instruction:** The \"rounded up\" instruction is key. A simple subtraction of years (2508 - 2504 = 4) coincidentally provides the correct answer, but the underlying duration is slightly more nuanced, spanning *across* 4 years. Any duration over 3 years must be rounded up to 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
