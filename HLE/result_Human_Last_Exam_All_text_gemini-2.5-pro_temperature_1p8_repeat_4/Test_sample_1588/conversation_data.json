    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for `Z` in the equation `e^Z = e^X e^Y`, where `X` and `Y` are non-commuting variables. The solution `Z` is given as an infinite series of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`:\n\n`Z = log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)`\n\nHere, `Z_n(X, Y)` is the \"term of order n\", which is a homogeneous polynomial of total degree `n` in `X` and `Y`. These terms are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by `X` and `Y`.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Terms of a Specific Order\n\nThe term `Z_n(X, Y)` is a linear combination of all linearly independent commutators of degree `n`. For example:\n*   `Z_1 = X + Y`\n*   `Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]`\n*   `Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [Y, X]]`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of non-zero coefficients in `Z_10`. This requires us to express `Z_10` in a basis for the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10 and then count how many of the coefficients in that linear combination are not zero.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Number of Coefficients to the Dimension of the Lie Algebra\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of free Lie algebras (specifically regarding the BCH formula) states that when `Z_n` is expressed in a standard basis of the free Lie algebra (such as a Hall basis or a Lyndon-Shirshov basis), all the coefficients are non-zero.\n\nThis crucial result means that the number of non-zero coefficients of order `n` is equal to the dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree `n`. Our task is thus transformed into finding this dimension for `n=10`.\n\n### Step 4: Use Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension\n\nThe dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree `n` generated by `k` elements is given by Witt's formula:\n\n`l_k(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}`\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the degree of the polynomials (order).\n*   `k` is the number of generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `\\mu(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nIn our problem:\n*   `n = 10` (order 10).\n*   `k = 2` (generators `X` and `Y`).\n\nWe need to calculate `l_2(10)`.\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Calculation\n\n1.  **Find the divisors of n=10:** The positive divisors `d` of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor:**\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a product of one distinct prime)\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a product of one distinct prime)\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1` (10 is a product of two distinct primes)\n\n3.  **Apply Witt's formula:**\n    `l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} + \\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} + \\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} + \\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} \\right]`\n\n4.  **Substitute the values:**\n    `l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^5 + (-1) \\cdot 2^2 + (1) \\cdot 2^1 \\right]`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the powers of 2:**\n    *   `2^{10} = 1024`\n    *   `2^5 = 32`\n    *   `2^2 = 4`\n    *   `2^1 = 2`\n\n6.  **Complete the arithmetic:**\n    `l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]`\n    `l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} [990]`\n    `l_2(10) = 99`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of linearly independent commutators of degree 10 is 99. Since all corresponding coefficients in the BCH expansion are non-zero, the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
