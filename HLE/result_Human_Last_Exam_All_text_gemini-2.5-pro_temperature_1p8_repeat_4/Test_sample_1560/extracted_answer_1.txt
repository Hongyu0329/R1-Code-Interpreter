The final state of the system after measurement is probabilistic. After applying gate Q to ququint A and subsequently measuring ququint A in the computational basis, the system collapses into one of the following five possible states with their associated probabilities:
1.  With probability 1/5, the final state is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  With probability 1/5, the final state is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  With probability 3/10, the final state is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  With probability 1/5, the final state is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With probability 1/10, the final state is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
