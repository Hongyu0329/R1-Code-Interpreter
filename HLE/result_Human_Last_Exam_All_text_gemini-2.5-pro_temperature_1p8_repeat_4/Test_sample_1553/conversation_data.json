    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by Polish author Jacek Dukaj.\n2.  **Identify the Main Character:** The protagonist of the novel is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who is resurrected in the far future.\n3.  **Identify the Specific Request:** The request is for the name of the character whom Adam Zamoyski marries.\n4.  **Analyze the Relationship and Plot:**\n    *   Throughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski develops a very close and complex relationship with a post-human entity known as a phoebe. Her name is Angelina.\n    *   Their relationship is central to the plot. She acts as his guide, protector, and partner in the alien reality of the future.\n    *   The concept of \"marriage\" in the context of this hard science fiction novel is not traditional. There is no conventional wedding ceremony.\n    *   Instead, their bond culminates at the end of the novel in a transcendent union. Adam, having achieved a god-like understanding and power, essentially creates a new reality or pocket universe for them to inhabit together, transcending their original forms. This ultimate, inseparable partnership is the novel's equivalent of a marriage.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the plot, the character who enters into this final, ultimate union with the main character, Adam Zamoyski, is Angelina.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Figurative \"Marriage\":** It's crucial to understand that the term \"marries\" should be interpreted figuratively. The novel doesn't depict a social or religious marriage ceremony. It depicts a much deeper, metaphysical fusion of two beings.\n*   **Character Identification:** The main character is Adam Zamoyski, and the character he unites with is Angelina. It's important not to confuse them with other characters in this complex world.\n*   **Novel's Genre:** As a work of hard science fiction and posthumanism, the novel redefines fundamental human concepts like relationships, identity, and existence. Therefore, applying a 21st-century definition of \"marriage\" literally would be misleading. The essence of the question points to the character with whom the protagonist forms the most definitive and final bond.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The main character is Adam Zamoyski.\n2.  He forms an ultimate, inseparable bond with the post-human character Angelina.\n3.  This bond is the closest equivalent to \"marriage\" in the novel's context.\n4.  Therefore, the name of the character is Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
