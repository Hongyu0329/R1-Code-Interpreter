    "This problem asks for the computation of the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. We will solve this by first finding the simplicial volume of each surface and then using the product formula for simplicial volumes.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Simplicial Volume of a Closed Oriented Surface**\n\nThe simplicial volume of a closed oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$ is a well-known result in the field. It is determined by the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$.\nThe Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$ is given by $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$.\n\nThe simplicial volume $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$ for surfaces with non-amenable fundamental groups (i.e., $g \\ge 2$).\nIf the fundamental group is amenable (i.e., $g=0$ for $S^2$ or $g=1$ for $T^2$), the simplicial volume is 0.\n\nLet's compute the simplicial volume for the two surfaces in the problem, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{31}$:**\n    The genus is $g_1 = 31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, the fundamental group is non-amenable and the simplicial volume is non-zero.\n    The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\Sigma_{31}) = 2 - 2(31) = 2 - 62 = -60$.\n    The simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_{31})| = 2|-60| = 120$.\n    Alternatively, using the direct formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$ for $g \\ge 2$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{17}$:**\n    The genus is $g_2 = 17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, the fundamental group is non-amenable and the simplicial volume is non-zero.\n    The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\Sigma_{17}) = 2 - 2(17) = 2 - 34 = -32$.\n    The simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_{17})| = 2|-32| = 64$.\n    Alternatively, using the direct formula:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** It is crucial to use the correct formula for the simplicial volume of a surface. For a hyperbolic surface ($\\Sigma_g$ with $g \\geq 2$), $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 4(g-1)$. For the sphere ($g=0$) or the torus ($g=1$), the volume is 0. Both genera in this problem (31 and 17) are greater than 1, so the non-zero formula applies.\n\n**Step 2: The Product Formula for Simplicial Volume**\n\nFor two closed, oriented manifolds $M^m$ of dimension $m$ and $N^n$ of dimension $n$, the simplicial volume of their Cartesian product $M \\times N$ is given by Gromov's product formula:\n$\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$.\n\nIn our problem, we have $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   The dimension of $M$ is $m = 2$.\n*   The dimension of $N$ is $n = 2$.\n*   The total dimension of the product manifold $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is $m+n = 4$.\n\nWe need to calculate the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m+n}{m} = \\binom{4}{2}$.\n$\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** A common mistake is to forget the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m+n}{m}$ in the product formula. Its inclusion is essential for the correct calculation. The coefficient depends on the dimensions of the factor manifolds.\n\n**Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nNow we combine the results from the previous steps to compute the final answer.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\n\nSubstituting the values we calculated:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n$6 \\times 120 = 720$.\n$720 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Ensure the arithmetic is performed correctly.\nWe can check the multiplication:\n$720 \\times 64 = 720 \\times (60 + 4) = 720 \\times 60 + 720 \\times 4 = 43200 + 2880 = 46080$.\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 46,080."
