    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Compound:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   \"Benzamide\" indicates a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group which is in turn attached to a nitrogen atom (`-C(=O)N-`).\n    *   \"N,N-diethyl\" means two ethyl groups (`-CH₂CH₃`) are attached to the amide nitrogen.\n    *   \"3-dimethylamino\" means a dimethylamino group (`-N(CH₃)₂`) is at the C-3 position of the benzene ring, relative to the amide group at C-1.\n\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n        C - N(CH₂CH₃)₂\n       /\n     (Benzene ring)\n      |\n      N(CH₃)₂ (at position 3)\n    ```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Set of Reagents and the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** `sec-BuLi` (sec-Butyllithium), `TMEDA` (Tetramethylethylenediamine), and `THF` (Tetrahydrofuran, the solvent).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents points to a **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction.\n    *   `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base that can deprotonate C-H bonds, especially those on an aromatic ring that are activated.\n    *   `TMEDA` is a bidentate ligand that chelates the lithium ion (Li⁺). This breaks up the aggregates of `sec-BuLi`, making it a more reactive base. More importantly, it helps to coordinate the lithium ion to a \"directing group\" on the substrate.\n*   **Identifying the Directing Groups:** The starting material has two potential directing groups:\n    1.  The **N,N-diethylamide group** (`-C(=O)NEt₂`) at C-1.\n    2.  The **dimethylamino group** (`-NMe₂`) at C-3.\n*   **Determining the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation):**\n    *   In a DoM reaction, the lithium reagent coordinates to a heteroatom-containing group (the directing group), and deprotonation occurs at a nearby *ortho* position.\n    *   We need to compare the directing strength of the two groups. The generally accepted order of directing ability is: `-C(=O)NR₂ > -O(CONR₂) > -SO₂NR₂ > -OMe > -NR₂`. The **amide group (`-C(=O)NR₂`) is a significantly stronger directing group** than the amino group (`-NR₂`).\n    *   The stronger amide director at C-1 will preferentially direct the lithiation to its ortho positions: C-2 and C-6.\n    *   The dimethylamino group at C-3 directs to its ortho positions: C-2 and C-4.\n    *   The C-2 position is *ortho* to both directing groups. This is a **synergistic effect**, where both groups cooperatively direct the metalation to the same site. This makes the proton at C-2 by far the most acidic and the most likely site for deprotonation.\n*   **Intermediate Formed:** The `sec-BuLi` will remove the hydrogen atom from the C-2 position, and a lithium atom will take its place, forming an aryllithium intermediate: 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This intermediate is a strong nucleophile.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** `CH₃I` (Methyl iodide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an **electrophilic quench**. The nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate reacts with an electrophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** The negatively polarized carbon at the C-2 position (the carbanion) of the aryllithium intermediate attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of methyl iodide. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction where iodide (`I⁻`) is the leaving group.\n*   **Bond Formation:** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the C-2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\n\n1.  Start with the initial structure: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n2.  The lithiation occurs at the C-2 position.\n3.  The lithium atom at C-2 is replaced by a methyl group.\n4.  The final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reagent Roles:** Understand that `sec-BuLi` is the base, `TMEDA` is a crucial activator and coordinating agent for DoM, and `CH₃I` is the electrophile.\n2.  **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM):** Recognize this key reaction pattern when an aromatic ring with a suitable directing group is treated with a strong organolithium base.\n3.  **Hierarchy of Directing Groups:** Correctly identifying that the amide (`-CONR₂`) is a much stronger director than the amino (`-NR₂`) group is critical for predicting the regioselectivity.\n4.  **Synergistic Effect:** Noticing that both groups direct to the C-2 position confirms that this site is overwhelmingly favored for deprotonation.\n5.  **Nature of Intermediate:** The aryllithium formed is a potent carbanionic nucleophile that readily reacts with electrophiles like alkyl halides.\n\nBy following this analysis, the structure of the final product can be confidently determined.\n\nThe final compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
