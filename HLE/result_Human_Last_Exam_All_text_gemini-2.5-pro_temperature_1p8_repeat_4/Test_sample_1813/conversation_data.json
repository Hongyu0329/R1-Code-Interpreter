    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object to be computed**\nThe \"generalized Markov number\" \\(m_r\\) associated with a rational number \\(r=p/q\\) is part of a larger theory connecting Diophantine approximation, hyperbolic geometry, and number theory. The \"continued fraction associated with \\(m_r\\)\" refers to the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number \\(\\theta_r\\), which is a root of an indefinite binary quadratic form whose properties define \\(m_r\\). The most direct way to find \\(\\theta_r\\) is by associating \\(r\\) with a matrix in \\(GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})\\) and finding its fixed points.\n\n**Step 2: Find the appropriate continued fraction for r = 4/7**\nA rational number has two standard finite continued fraction expansions. For \\(r=4/7\\):\n1.  \\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = \\frac{1}{1+3/4} = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+1/3}} \\). This gives \\(r = [0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The number of terms, \\(n\\), is 3.\n2.  We can write the last term \\(3\\) as \\(2+1\\), which gives \\( \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{2+1/1}}} \\). This gives \\(r = [0; 1, 1, 2, 1]\\). The number of terms, \\(n\\), is 4.\n\nThe theory requires us to choose the expansion such that for the convergents \\(p_k/q_k\\), the relation \\(p_n q_{n-1} - q_n p_{n-1} = (-1)^n = -1\\) holds. This means we must choose the expansion with an even number of terms, \\(n\\).\nFor \\(r = [0; 1, 1, 3]\\), \\(n=3\\). The convergents are \\(1/1, 1/2, 4/7\\). Here \\(p_3=4, q_3=7, p_2=1, q_2=2\\). So \\(p_3q_2 - q_3p_2 = 4(2) - 7(1) = 1 = (-1)^{3-1}\\). This is not the one we need.\nFor \\(r = [0; 1, 1, 2, 1]\\), \\(n=4\\). The convergents are \\(1/1, 1/2, 3/5, 4/7\\). Here \\(p_4=4, q_4=7, p_3=3, q_3=5\\). So \\(p_4q_3 - q_4p_3 = 4(5) - 7(3) = 20-21 = -1 = (-1)^{4-1}\\). This is the correct expansion.\nSo we will work with \\(r=4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 2, 1]\\).\n\n**Step 3: Construct the associated matrix**\nThe matrix \\(M_r\\) associated with the continued fraction \\(r = [0; a_1, \\dots, a_n]\\) is given by the product \\(M_1 M_2 \\dots M_n\\) where \\(M_i = \\begin{pmatrix} a_i & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\). Alternatively, its columns are formed by the last two convergents: \\(M_r = \\begin{pmatrix} p_n & p_{n-1} \\\\ q_n & q_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}\\).\nUsing our convergents from Step 2: \\(p_n=p_4=4, q_n=q_4=7\\) and \\(p_{n-1}=p_3=3, q_{n-1}=q_3=5\\).\nThe matrix is \\( M_{4/7} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 3 \\\\ 7 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\n**Step 4: Find the fixed points of the matrix**\nThe quadratic irrational \\(\\theta_r\\) is a fixed point of the linear fractional transformation defined by \\(M_r\\). A fixed point \\(\\theta\\) satisfies the equation \\(\\theta = \\frac{4\\theta+3}{7\\theta+5}\\).\nThis leads to the quadratic equation:\n\\( 7\\theta^2 + 5\\theta = 4\\theta + 3 \\)\n\\( 7\\theta^2 + \\theta - 3 = 0 \\)\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the positive root**\nWe solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\\( \\theta = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(7)(-3)}}{2(7)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+84}}{14} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{85}}{14} \\)\nBy convention, we choose the positive root:\n\\( \\theta = \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{85}}{14} \\)\n\n**Step 6: Compute the continued fraction of the positive root**\nWe use the standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational. Let \\(\\xi_0 = \\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{85}-1}{14}\\).\n-   \\(9 < \\sqrt{85} < 10\\), so \\( \\frac{8}{14} < \\xi_0 < \\frac{9}{14} \\). Thus, \\(a_0 = \\lfloor \\xi_0 \\rfloor = 0\\).\n-   \\( \\xi_1 = \\frac{1}{\\xi_0-a_0} = \\frac{14}{\\sqrt{85}-1} = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{85}+1)}{85-1} = \\frac{14(\\sqrt{85}+1)}{84} = \\frac{\\sqrt{85}+1}{6} \\).\n    \\(a_1 = \\lfloor \\xi_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9.21...+1}{6} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.70... \\rfloor = 1\\).\n-   \\( \\xi_2 = \\frac{1}{\\xi_1-a_1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{85}+1}{6}-1} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{85}-5} = \\frac{6(\\sqrt{85}+5)}{85-25} = \\frac{6(\\sqrt{85}+5)}{60} = \\frac{\\sqrt{85}+5}{10} \\).\n    \\(a_2 = \\lfloor \\xi_2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9.21...+5}{10} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.42... \\rfloor = 1\\).\n-   \\( \\xi_3 = \\frac{1}{\\xi_2-a_2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{85}+5}{10}-1} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{85}-5} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{85}+5)}{60} = \\frac{\\sqrt{85}+5}{6} \\).\n    \\(a_3 = \\lfloor \\xi_3 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9.21...+5}{6} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.36... \\rfloor = 2\\).\n-   \\( \\xi_4 = \\frac{1}{\\xi_3-a_3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{85}+5}{6}-2} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{85}-7} = \\frac{6(\\sqrt{85}+7)}{85-49} = \\frac{6(\\sqrt{85}+7)}{36} = \\frac{\\sqrt{85}+7}{6} \\).\n    \\(a_4 = \\lfloor \\xi_4 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9.21...+7}{6} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2.70... \\rfloor = 2\\).\n-   \\( \\xi_5 = \\frac{1}{\\xi_4-a_4} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{85}+7}{6}-2} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{85}-5} = \\frac{\\sqrt{85}+5}{10} = \\xi_2 \\).\nSince a remainder (\\(\\xi_2\\)) has repeated, the sequence of quotients will repeat from that point. The periodic part starts with \\(a_2\\).\nThe sequence of coefficients is \\(a_0=0, a_1=1\\), and the repeating block is \\((a_2, a_3, a_4) = (1, 2, 2)\\).\nTherefore, the continued fraction is \\( [0; 1, \\overline{1, 2, 2}] \\)."
