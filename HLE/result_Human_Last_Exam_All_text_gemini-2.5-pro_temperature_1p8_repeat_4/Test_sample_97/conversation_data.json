    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)₃ in water is not a simple one-step process. We must account for both the direct dissolution of Al(OH)₃ into its ions and the subsequent reaction of these ions to form a complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n2.  **Solubility Definition:** The total solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\n3.  **Water Autoionization:** The concentration of OH⁻ in the solution is affected by the dissolution and complex formation reactions. Therefore, we cannot assume the solution remains neutral (pH=7, [OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻⁷ M). We must include the autoionization of water (K_w) in our calculations.\n4.  **Charge Balance:** The principle of electroneutrality is a powerful tool for solving complex equilibrium problems. The sum of the positive charges in the solution must equal the sum of the negative charges. This provides a \"master equation\" to solve for the unknown concentrations.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria and their constants.**\n\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Formation of the complex ion:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoionization of water:**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25 °C)\n\n*   **Combined reaction for complex formation from the solid:**\n    We can combine the K_sp and K_f reactions to describe the dissolution of Al(OH)₃ directly into the complex ion.\n    Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction (K_c) is the product of K_sp and K_f.\n    K_c = K_sp × K_f = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) × (1.1 × 10³¹) = 5.83 × 10⁴\n    So, K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻] = 5.83 × 10⁴\n\n**Step 2: Define solubility (S) and express species concentrations in terms of [OH⁻].**\n\n*   The total molar solubility, S, is the total concentration of dissolved aluminum:\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n*   We can express the concentrations of the aluminum species as a function of [OH⁻]:\n    From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / [OH⁻]³\n    From K_c: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × [OH⁻]\n    From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Set up the charge balance equation.**\n\nThe solution must be electrically neutral. We sum the concentrations of all charged species, multiplied by their respective charge magnitudes.\nPositive charges = Negative charges\n[H⁺] + 3[Al³⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Substitute and solve for [OH⁻].**\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 2 into the charge balance equation. Let x = [OH⁻].\n(K_w / x) + 3(K_sp / x³) = x + (K_c × x)\n(1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / x) + 3(5.3 × 10⁻²⁷ / x³) = x + (5.83 × 10⁴ × x)\n(1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / x) + (1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ / x³) = (1 + 5.83 × 10⁴)x\n(1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / x) + (1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ / x³) ≈ (5.83 × 10⁴)x\n\nMultiply the entire equation by x³ to eliminate the denominators:\n(1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)x² + 1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ = (5.83 × 10⁴)x⁴\n\nRearrange into a standard polynomial form (this is a quadratic equation for x²):\n(5.83 × 10⁴)x⁴ - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)x² - 1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nLet y = x². Solving this quadratic equation for y using the quadratic formula, y = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/2a:\ny = [ -(-1.0×10⁻¹⁴) ± sqrt( (-1.0×10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83×10⁴)(-1.59×10⁻²⁶) ) ] / [ 2(5.83×10⁴) ]\ny = [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt( 1.0×10⁻²⁸ + 3.71×10⁻²¹ ) ] / (1.166×10⁵)\nSince the first term under the square root is negligible, we get:\ny ≈ [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt( 3.71×10⁻²¹ ) ] / (1.166×10⁵)\ny ≈ [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.09×10⁻¹¹ ] / (1.166×10⁵)\n\nSince y = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\ny ≈ (6.09 × 10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 × 10⁵) ≈ 5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶\nNow, solve for x = [OH⁻]:\nx = [OH⁻] = sqrt(y) = sqrt(5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.28 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final solubility, S.**\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻], we can calculate the concentrations of the individual aluminum species and sum them to find the total solubility.\n[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 × 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.46 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.28 × 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.46 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000446 + 0.00133\nS = 0.001776 mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\nS = 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
