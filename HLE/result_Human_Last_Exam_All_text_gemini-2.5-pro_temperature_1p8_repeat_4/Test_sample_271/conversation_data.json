    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the possible degrees of the specified normal field extensions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Polynomial and its Splitting Field\n\nLet the given polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe first try to factor this polynomial. By grouping terms, we can see a common factor:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Let's analyze them separately.\n\n**Analysis of $h(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\nThe roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of degree 2, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n**Analysis of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n1.  **Irreducibility:** Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n    *   3 divides the coefficients -9 and 3.\n    *   3 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n    *   $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3.\n    Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Number of Real Roots:** We examine the derivative: $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$.\n    The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    Let's evaluate $g(x)$ at these points:\n    *   At $x_1 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$: $g(x_1) = (\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 - 9(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}( (9/5) - 9 ) + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. Since $\\sqrt[4]{9/5} = \\sqrt{1.8} > \\sqrt{1} = 1$, we have $\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 7.2$. Thus, $g(x_1) < 0$.\n    *   At $x_2 = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$: $g(x_2) = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 0$.\n    The polynomial $g(x)$ has two local extrema, one positive maximum and one negative minimum. Since $g(x) \\to \\pm\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, this implies $g(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n3.  **Galois Group:** The Galois group of an irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex roots is the symmetric group $S_5$. Let $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$. Then $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$ and $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Galois Group of K over Q\n\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum $K_g K_h = K_g(\\sqrt{2})$. The degree of the extension is given by $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_g \\cap K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\nWe need to determine the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis intersection is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so it is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nIf $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ must be a quadratic subfield of $K_g$.\nBy Galois theory, the quadratic subfields of $K_g$ correspond to the subgroups of index 2 in its Galois group, $S_5$. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. The fixed field of $A_5$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the polynomial $g(x)$.\nThe sign of the discriminant is given by $(-1)^c$, where $c$ is the number of pairs of complex conjugate roots. We found that $g(x)$ has 2 complex roots, so $c=1$. This means the discriminant $D$ is negative.\nTherefore, the unique quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, which is an imaginary quadratic field.\nThe field $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is not a subfield of $K_g$.\nThis implies the intersection is trivial: $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe degree of $K$ is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 120 \\cdot 2 / 1 = 240$.\nSince the intersection is trivial, the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\n### Step 3: Find Degrees of Normal Sub-extensions\n\nWe are looking for the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ and subgroups of the Galois group $G$.\nThe extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if its corresponding subgroup, $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe conditions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ imply that $H$ must be a proper non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe must find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ and calculate their indices.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}, C_2$.\n\nNormal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ can be of two types:\n1.  **Product Subgroups:** Subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\vartriangleleft S_5$ and $N_2 \\vartriangleleft C_2$.\n    *   $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H_1| = 2$. Index $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$. This gives a degree of **120**.\n    *   $H_2 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_2| = |A_5| = 60$. Index $[G:H_2] = 240/60 = 4$. This gives a degree of **4**.\n    *   $H_3 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_3| = |S_5| = 120$. Index $[G:H_3] = 240/120 = 2$. This gives a degree of **2**.\n    *   $H_4 = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H_4| = 60 \\times 2 = 120$. Index $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$. This also gives a degree of **2**.\n    (The trivial cases $H = \\{e\\}\\times\\{e\\}$ and $H=S_5 \\times C_2$ are excluded as they correspond to $L=K$ and $L=\\mathbb{Q}$ respectively).\n\n2.  **Diagonal Subgroups:** These exist because $S_5$ and $C_2$ have a common non-trivial quotient group: $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$ and $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    Let $\\phi: S_5 \\to C_2$ be the sign homomorphism (which has kernel $A_5$). The diagonal subgroup is the graph of this homomorphism:\n    *   $H_5 = \\{ (g, \\phi(g)) \\mid g \\in S_5 \\}$.\n    This is a normal subgroup of $S_5 \\times C_2$. Its order is $|H_5| = |S_5| = 120$.\n    The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$. This gives another field of degree **2**.\n\n### Step 4: List the Possible Degrees\n\nThe possible indices we found for proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ are 120, 4, and 2. These are the possible degrees for the normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe set of possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
