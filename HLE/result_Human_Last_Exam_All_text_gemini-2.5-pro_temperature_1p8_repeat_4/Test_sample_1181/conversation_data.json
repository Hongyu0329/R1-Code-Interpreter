    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 movie *Solaris*. The specific detail to pinpoint is which character expresses the feeling of being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This requires knowledge of the film's characters and key dialogue.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points**\n*   **Film Specificity:** The question specifies the 1972 Tarkovsky version, which is crucial because its tone and focus on nostalgia for Earth are different from Stanislaw Lem's novel or the 2002 remake.\n*   **Emotion and Subject:** The feeling isn't just \"missing Earth.\" It's a very specific combination: nostalgia for a simple sound (\"rustling leaves\") coupled with a sense of \"shame\" for feeling it.\n*   **Character Profiles:** To answer correctly, we must analyze the motivations and personalities of the characters provided in the options.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of the Characters**\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist, a psychologist sent from Earth to the Solaris station. The film opens with an extended sequence showing him on Earth, surrounded by nature, including grass, water, and trees. This establishes his deep connection to the terrestrial world he has left behind. His journey is one of grappling with memory, guilt, and the loss of his human connections. He is the character most emotionally tethered to Earth. In a poignant monologue to Hari, he explicitly confesses this feeling of nostalgia and his shame over it, demonstrating his inner conflict between the grand cosmic mission and his simple human longings.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his deceased wife, created by the Solaris ocean. She is not a human who has traveled from Earth; her existence is confined to the station and Kris's memories. Therefore, she would have no memories of Earth to miss.\n\n*   **C. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is one of the scientists already on the station when Kris arrives. He is weary, cynical, and philosophical. While he understands the psychological toll of being in space, his dialogue is more about the larger philosophical implications of Solaris and humanity's inability to comprehend it. He does not express this specific, personal, shame-filled nostalgia.\n\n*   **D. Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is the other scientist. He is rigid, cold, and strictly scientific. He views the \"visitors\" as a scientific phenomenon to be studied and eliminated. He shows open contempt for Kris's emotional responses and would see a feeling like \"missing rustling leaves\" as a contemptible weakness.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Gibarian is the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a final video message. In the video, he is terrified and distraught, trying to warn Kris about the nature of Solaris. His state is one of fear and despair, not nostalgic shame.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBased on the character analysis, Kris Kelvin is the only one whose journey and dialogue align with the specific sentiment described in the question. His deep connection to Earth, established in the film's opening, provides the foundation for his profound nostalgia. The shame he feels is part of his complex psychological struggle. It is indeed Kris who confesses this specific longing to Hari.\n\n<<<A>>>"
