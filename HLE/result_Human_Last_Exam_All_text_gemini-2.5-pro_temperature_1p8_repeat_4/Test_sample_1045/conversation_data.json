    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular composition.**\nThe chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. We need to interpret what it means for each type of atom in the molecule.\n\n*   **The hyphen separates core and valence orbitals.**\n*   **\"6\"**: The number before the hyphen describes the core orbitals. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single **contracted** Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed by a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **\"31\"**: The numbers after the hyphen describe the valence orbitals. The valence shell is \"split\" into two basis functions:\n    *   **\"3\"**: The inner part of the valence shell is described by one CGF composed of 3 PGFs.\n    *   **\"1\"**: The outer part of the valence shell is described by one CGF composed of 1 PGF.\n*   **\"G\"**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted functions for a Hydrogen (H) atom.**\n*   A Hydrogen atom has one electron in the 1s orbital. It has **no core electrons**, only a valence electron.\n*   According to the 6-31G notation, the valence shell (1s) is split into two parts (\"31\").\n*   One CGF for the inner part (1s').\n*   One CGF for the outer part (1s'').\n*   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = 2.**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of contracted functions for a Carbon (C) atom.**\n*   A Carbon atom has the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** Represented by the \"6\". This gives **1 CGF** for the 1s orbital.\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):** Represented by the \"31\" split.\n    *   **Inner Valence Part (\"3\"):** This part has one CGF for the 2s orbital and one CGF for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        *   1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence Part (\"1\"):** This part also has one CGF for the 2s orbital and one CGF for each of the three 2p orbitals.\n        *   1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9.**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted functions for the toluene (C7H8) molecule.**\n*   Calculate the total contribution from all Carbon atoms:\n    *   7 Carbon atoms × 9 CGFs/Carbon = 63 CGFs.\n*   Calculate the total contribution from all Hydrogen atoms:\n    *   8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 CGFs/Hydrogen = 16 CGFs.\n*   Sum the contributions from all atoms:\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for **contracted** functions, not primitive ones. The number of contracted functions is the size of the basis set used in the final calculation.\n*   **Core vs. Valence:** Correctly identifying which electrons are core and which are valence for each atom is crucial. Hydrogen has no core electrons. Carbon's 1s electrons are core.\n*   **Split-Valence Interpretation:** Understanding that \"31\" means the valence shell is represented by two separate sets of functions (an inner set and an outer set) is key.\n*   **p-orbitals:** Remember that for second-row atoms, the `p` shell consists of three orbitals (px, py, pz), and each requires its own basis function within a given set. So, a \"p set\" contributes 3 functions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions used in a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene (C7H8) is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
