    "This question requires a deep understanding of the technical principles of the five standard ballroom dances. Let's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**The Core of the Question:**\nThe question asks in which dance it is *impossible* to *overturn* a *reverse turn* without *disregarding the technique*.\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in all five dances where the couple turns to the left.\n*   **Overturn:** To turn more than the standard prescribed amount for the figure.\n*   **Disregarding the technique:** This is the key. It means breaking the fundamental rules of the dance, such as footwork, rise and fall, sway, or body action.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Dance:**\n\n1.  **A. Viennese Waltz:**\n    *   **Technique:** This dance is characterized by continuous rotation, speed, and momentum. It has rise and fall.\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A 6-step figure that completes one full 360° turn.\n    *   **Overturning:** While the standard is a full turn, slight over-turning or under-turning is often necessary for floorcraft (navigating the dance floor). Because of the flowing, continuous nature and the use of rise and fall, slightly more rotation can be added without fundamentally breaking the dance's technique. It might not be ideal, but it's not technically impossible.\n\n2.  **B. English Waltz:**\n    *   **Technique:** This is a \"swing\" dance with significant rise and fall, body sway, and flowing movement.\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A 6-step figure that typically turns 3/4 of a full circle.\n    *   **Overturning:** It is not only possible but also a common and officially recognized variation. An \"Overturned Reverse Turn\" is a syllabus figure used, for example, to negotiate a corner. The rise and fall technique facilitates this extra rotation. Therefore, overturning is a part of the technique, not a disregard of it.\n\n3.  **C. European Tango:**\n    *   **Technique:** Tango technique is unique among the ballroom dances. Its core principles include:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept flat and grounded.\n        *   **No Sway:** The upper body is held still and upright.\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp and clipped, not flowing.\n        *   **Specific Footwork:** Feet are generally kept in contact with the floor.\n    *   **Reverse Turn (Lady Outside):** Let's examine the man's first three steps where the turn happens:\n        1.  Left Foot forward, commencing to turn left.\n        2.  Right Foot to the side, continuing to turn.\n        3.  Left Foot closes to Right Foot.\n    *   **Why Overturning is Impossible:** The third step is critical. The feet close together, and the weight is transferred flatly, without any rise. This closing action acts as a \"brake\" on the rotation. To turn any further, the dancer would have to pivot on the spot, which would require lifting the heels. Lifting the heels introduces \"rise,\" which is a direct and fundamental violation of Tango technique. The entire character of the figure and the dance would be destroyed. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango Reverse Turn *without disregarding the core technique*.\n\n4.  **D. Slow Foxtrot:**\n    *   **Technique:** Like the Waltz, Foxtrot is a swing dance characterized by continuous, flowing movement, rise and fall, and sway. Its technique is built on the concept of \"heel turns\" and \"feather steps\".\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A 7-step figure (including the feather finish) that turns 3/4 to the left.\n    *   **Overturning:** Similar to the Waltz, an \"Overturned Reverse Turn with Feather Finish\" is a standard, named variation in the syllabus, used for changing alignment or getting around corners. The technique of rise and fall allows for this extra rotation.\n\n5.  **E. Quickstep:**\n    *   **Technique:** A fast and energetic dance that combines elements of Foxtrot and Charleston. It features rise and fall, hops, runs, and chassés.\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure often used in conjunction with other figures like a progressive chassé.\n    *   **Overturning:** Due to the high speed and the need for agile navigation (floorcraft), varying the amount of turn on figures is common and necessary. The dynamic technique with rise and fall allows for this. Overturning a Reverse Turn is entirely possible and often done without violating the basic principles of the dance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the technique of \"rise and fall\" facilitates rotation and makes overturning a turn a standard and acceptable variation. In the European Tango, the absolute lack of \"rise\" and the specific action of closing the feet flatly on the third step of the reverse turn makes any further rotation impossible without breaking this fundamental technical rule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
