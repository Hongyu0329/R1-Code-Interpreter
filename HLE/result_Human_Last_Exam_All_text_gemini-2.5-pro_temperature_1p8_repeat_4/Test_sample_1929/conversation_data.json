    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (more specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is a substituted alkene, which can act as a dienophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition, where the 4 π-electrons from the diene and the 2 π-electrons from the dienophile react to form a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the basic structure of the product.**\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted, pericyclic reaction that forms two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new pi (π) bond, at the expense of three existing π bonds.\n*   The four carbon atoms of butadiene and the two carbon atoms of the dienophile combine to form a cyclohexene ring. The new double bond is formed between the central carbons (C2 and C3) of the original diene.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the regiochemistry of the reaction.**\n*   Regiochemistry deals with which way the reactants add together when they are unsymmetrical.\n*   **Diene (Butadiene):** It is symmetrical. The two ends (C1 and C4) are identical (CH₂), and the two central carbons (C2 and C3) are identical (CH).\n*   **Dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene):** It is unsymmetrical. One carbon of the double bond is attached to two chlorine atoms (CCl₂), and the other is attached to two fluorine atoms (CF₂).\n*   Because the dienophile is unsymmetrical, two different regioisomers are possible products. Let's call the carbons from butadiene C₁ to C₄ and the carbons from the dienophile C₅(F₂) and C₆(Cl₂).\n    *   **Possibility A:** New bonds form between C₁-C₅ and C₄-C₆. The CF₂ group ends up next to one CH₂ group from butadiene, and the CCl₂ group ends up next to the other.\n    *   **Possibility B:** New bonds form between C₁-C₆ and C₄-C₅. The CCl₂ group ends up next to one CH₂ group, and the CF₂ group ends up next to the other.\n*   These two possibilities lead to two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the major regioisomer.**\n*   The regioselectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction is governed by electronic effects. The diene acts as a nucleophile, and the dienophile acts as an electrophile. The reaction favors the orientation that matches the most nucleophilic site of the diene with the most electrophilic site of the dienophile.\n*   In our case, the diene is symmetrical, so we only need to determine which carbon of the CCl₂=CF₂ double bond is more electrophilic (i.e., more electron-deficient).\n*   This can be predicted by considering the electronegativity of the halogen substituents. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and its electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) is stronger than that of chlorine.\n*   The two fluorine atoms pull electron density away from their attached carbon more strongly than the two chlorine atoms do from theirs. This makes the CF₂ carbon more electron-deficient (more partially positive, δ+) than the CCl₂ carbon.\n*   Therefore, the CF₂ carbon is the more electrophilic site of the dienophile.\n*   The reaction will proceed in a way that the terminal carbons of the nucleophilic diene attack the more electrophilic CF₂ carbon of the dienophile. Since butadiene is symmetric, one of its terminal CH₂ groups will form a bond with the CF₂ carbon. The other terminal CH₂ group must then form a bond with the CCl₂ carbon.\n\n**Step 5: Draw and name the final product.**\n*   Based on the analysis in Step 4, the product is formed by connecting one end of butadiene to the CF₂ carbon and the other end to the CCl₂ carbon.\n*   Let's draw the resulting structure: a cyclohexene ring where the substituents from the dienophile, -CCl₂- and -CF₂-, are on adjacent carbons.\n    ```\n          CH==CH\n         /      \\\n       CH₂       CH₂\n        |         |\n       CCl₂ ----- CF₂\n    ```\n*   To name this molecule using IUPAC nomenclature:\n    1.  The parent ring is cyclohexene.\n    2.  Numbering must start at the double bond, so the double-bonded carbons are C-1 and C-2.\n    3.  We number around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Both ways of numbering around the ring (clockwise or counter-clockwise) will place the substituents at positions 4 and 5. This gives the locant set {4,4,5,5}.\n    4.  When there is a choice, IUPAC rules state that the substituent that comes first alphabetically should be assigned the lower number. The prefixes are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically.\n    5.  Therefore, we must number the ring such that the CCl₂ group is on carbon 4 and the CF₂ group is on carbon 5.\n*   The final name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Final Product Structure:**\nThe structure has a six-membered ring with a double bond. Adjacent to one end of the double bond is a CH₂ group, which is connected to a CCl₂ group. The CCl₂ group is connected to a CF₂ group. The CF₂ group is connected to the other CH₂ group, which is adjacent to the other end of the double bond.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
