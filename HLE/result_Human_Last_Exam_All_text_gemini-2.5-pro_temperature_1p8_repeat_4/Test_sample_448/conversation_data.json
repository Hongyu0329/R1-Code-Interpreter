    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** Noble gases.\n*   **Metric:** Rarest, measured as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n*   **Location:** Earth.\n*   **Timeframe:** 2002.\n\n**Step 2: List the naturally occurring noble gases.**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The ones that occur naturally on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n*(Note: Oganesson (Og) is also a noble gas, but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth and is therefore excluded from this analysis.)*\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the abundance of each noble gas in \"terrestrial matter\".**\n\"Terrestrial matter\" primarily refers to the Earth's atmosphere and crust, where these gases are found. We must consider the abundance in all terrestrial reservoirs.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** This is by far the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.93% of the Earth's atmosphere. Its abundance is primarily due to the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust over geological time.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere, at about 18 parts per million (ppm).\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant in the atmosphere at about 5 ppm. It is also produced by radioactive decay in the crust and can be found trapped in natural gas reserves.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Significantly rarer, found at about 1.1 ppm in the atmosphere.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the *stable* noble gases. Its concentration in the atmosphere is extremely low, at about 0.09 ppm, or 90 parts per billion.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Radon (Rn) and its unique properties.**\n*   Radon is different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive and has no stable isotopes.\n*   It is formed continuously through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are found in trace amounts in soil, rocks, and groundwater across the planet.\n*   The crucial point is Radon's very short half-life. Its most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. This means that Radon decays into other elements very quickly after it is formed.\n*   Because it decays so rapidly, it cannot accumulate in the atmosphere or crust in any significant quantity.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the total amount of Xenon vs. Radon.**\n*   While Xenon is extremely rare, with an atmospheric concentration of only 0.09 ppm, its stability means that the total amount present in the Earth's atmosphere is still enormous (estimated at over 2 trillion kilograms).\n*   In contrast, due to its rapid decay, the total amount of Radon present on the entire planet (in the atmosphere, soil, and water) at any single moment is estimated to be exceptionally smallâ€”only on the order of a few kilograms.\n*   This makes the abundance of Radon, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, many, many orders of magnitude lower than that of Xenon.\n\n**Step 6: Address the \"2002\" timeframe.**\nThe relative abundances of the noble gases are governed by long-term geological and nuclear decay processes that have been stable for millions of years. The fundamental ranking of which gas is rarest would not have been different in 2002 compared to today.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing all the naturally occurring noble gases, Radon's extremely short half-life prevents it from accumulating, making its total quantity on Earth at any given time infinitesimally small. It is, by a vast margin, the rarest noble gas as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
