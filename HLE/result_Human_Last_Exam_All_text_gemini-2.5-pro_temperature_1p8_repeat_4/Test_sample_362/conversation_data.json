    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Carbonyl compound:** Pivalaldehyde. The \"pival-\" prefix refers to the pivaloyl group, which is derived from pivalic acid ((CH₃)₃CCOOH). Pivalaldehyde is thus (CH₃)₃CCHO, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal. It is an aldehyde with a bulky tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is the IUPAC name for a phosphorus ylide.\n        *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane`: This indicates a phosphorus atom with three phenyl groups (PPh₃). The λ⁵ designation indicates the bonding state of phosphorus.\n        *   `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)`: This describes the organic group double-bonded to the phosphorus atom.\n            *   `ethylidene` refers to a two-carbon fragment with a double bond at one end. Let's label the carbons C1 and C2, so the fragment is C2-C1=. The double bond to phosphorus is at C1, giving C2-C1=PPh₃.\n            *   `2-(2-chlorophenyl)` indicates that a 2-chlorophenyl group (a benzene ring with a chlorine atom at the ortho position) is attached to the C2 position of the ethylidene fragment.\n        *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃.\n\n2.  **Classify the Wittig Reagent:**\n    *   The Wittig reagent can be classified based on the substituent on the negatively charged carbon in its carbanion resonance form (Ph₃P⁺–C⁻H-R).\n    *   In our ylide, the group attached to the ylidic carbon (=CH-) is a `2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl` group (-CH₂-CH₂-C₆H₄Cl). This is an alkyl-type substituent.\n    *   Ylides with alkyl or hydrogen substituents on the ylidic carbon are classified as **non-stabilized (or unstabilized) ylides**. They are highly reactive.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Stabilized ylides have an electron-withdrawing group (like C=O, CN, ester) directly attached to the ylidic carbon, which our ylide does not have. The phenyl ring is too far away to have a significant stabilizing effect via resonance.\n\n3.  **Predict the Reaction and Product Skeleton:**\n    *   The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. It involves the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a phosphorus ylide. The net result is the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom (C=O) with the carbon group from the ylide (C=CR₂).\n    *   The oxygen from pivalaldehyde will combine with the triphenylphosphine part of the ylide to form triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O) as a byproduct.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde will form a double bond with the ylidic carbon.\n    *   Let's connect the fragments:\n        *   From pivalaldehyde: (CH₃)₃C-CH=\n        *   From the ylide: =CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)\n    *   Combining these yields the alkene skeleton: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction forms a new C=C double bond that can have either *E* or *Z* stereochemistry.\n    *   The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the type of ylide used.\n    *   **Rule:** Reactions of **non-stabilized ylides** with aldehydes generally yield the **Z-alkene** (or *cis*-alkene) as the major product. This is because the reaction is under kinetic control, and the transition state leading to the *cis*-oxaphosphetane intermediate (which decomposes to the Z-alkene) is lower in energy.\n    *   Therefore, the major product will be the *Z*-isomer of the alkene.\n\n5.  **Define the Structure of the Z-isomer:**\n    *   To determine the *Z* configuration, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the substituents on each carbon of the double bond.\n        *   On the carbon from pivalaldehyde: The substituents are a tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃) and a hydrogen (-H). The tert-butyl group has higher priority.\n        *   On the carbon from the ylide: The substituents are a `2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl` group (-CH₂-CH₂-C₆H₄Cl) and a hydrogen (-H). The ethyl-based group has higher priority.\n    *   In the *Z*-isomer, the two higher-priority groups (the tert-butyl group and the `2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl` group) are on the **same side** of the double bond.\n\n6.  **Name the Final Product:**\n    *   The chemical structure is (Z)-(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄).\n    *   To name it according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    *   The chain is: (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-¹CH₂-²CH=³CH-⁴C(CH₃)₃.\n    *   The longest chain has 5 carbons (from C1 to one of the methyls on the t-butyl group). The parent name is **pentene**.\n    *   Numbering from the right would give the double bond position 3. Numbering from the left gives it position 2. We choose the numbering that gives the double bond the lowest locant, so it is a **pent-2-ene**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   At C1: a (2-chlorophenyl) group.\n        *   At C4: two methyl groups.\n    *   The systematic name is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n    *   Including the stereochemistry, the final product name is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is an alkene. Based on the analysis of the reactants, the non-stabilized ylide favors the formation of the *Z*-isomer. The final product is named (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene >>>"
