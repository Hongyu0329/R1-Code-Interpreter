    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Chern Insulator:** A 2D topological material whose insulating bulk is characterized by an integer topological invariant called the Chern number (C).\n*   **Chern Number (C):** The Chern number quantifies the topology of the electronic band structure. Physically, it determines the quantized Hall conductivity of the material, $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n*   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** This fundamental principle of topological physics states that the Chern number of the bulk determines the number of protected, one-way (chiral) edge states at the boundary of the material. Specifically, at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers $C_1$ and $C_2$, there will be $N = |C_1 - C_2|$ topologically protected gapless edge modes. The net number of modes travelling in one direction is $C_1 - C_2$.\n*   **The System:** The problem describes a setup where two Chern insulators are placed side-by-side (\"laterally\"). Both insulators have a Chern number $C=1$. They are separated by a junction where the \"tunneling barrier is negligible,\" meaning electrons can move freely between the two regions at this interface.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Edge States of the Individual Insulators\n\n*   Let's call the left insulator Region 1 ($C_1 = 1$) and the right insulator Region 2 ($C_2 = 1$).\n*   Before being joined, each insulator has a boundary with the vacuum (which has $C=0$). According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, each insulator would have $C - 0 = 1$ chiral edge state circulating its perimeter.\n*   Let's assume a positive Chern number corresponds to a clockwise-propagating edge state.\n    *   **Region 1 (left):** It has a clockwise edge state. Along its right edge (which will become the junction), this state propagates downwards.\n    *   **Region 2 (right):** It also has a clockwise edge state. Along its left edge (which will become the junction), this state propagates upwards.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Physics at the Junction\n\n*   When the two insulators are brought together, their interface forms the junction.\n*   At this junction, we have two edge states originating from the two regions:\n    1.  A downward-propagating state from Region 1.\n    2.  An upward-propagating state from Region 2.\n*   These two states are **counter-propagating** at the same interface.\n*   The problem states that the \"tunneling barrier is negligible.\" This is a crucial point. It means the two counter-propagating states are not isolated from each other. They can interact, scatter, and mix.\n*   A pair of counter-propagating states is not topologically protected against perturbations that couple them. The interaction will cause the states to hybridize, opening an energy gap. This phenomenon is often referred to as the states \"gapping out\" or \"annihilating\" each other.\n*   Consequently, there are **no longer any protected gapless states** that can propagate along the internal junction.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Question and Calculate the Final Answer\n\n*   The question asks for the \"Chern number of this junction.\" This phrasing is slightly ambiguous because the Chern number is technically a property of a 2D bulk, not a 1D junction.\n*   **Careful Point:** In the context of topological physics, a question about a topological property \"of a junction\" or \"of an interface\" almost always refers to the number of protected edge modes that are hosted at that interface.\n*   This number can be calculated directly using the bulk-boundary correspondence formula for an interface between two regions:\n    *   Number of net chiral modes, $N = C_1 - C_2$.\n*   Applying this formula to our system:\n    *   $C_1 = 1$ (left insulator)\n    *   $C_2 = 1$ (right insulator)\n    *   $N = 1 - 1 = 0$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe junction between two Chern insulators with the same Chern number does not support any net protected chiral edge modes. The individual edge states that would exist at the boundaries before joining are counter-propagating at the junction and gap each other out due to the non-zero coupling. Therefore, the effective topological number characterizing the junction is 0. The outer boundaries of the combined system will support a single chiral edge state, consistent with the fact that the entire composite system is a single, larger Chern insulator with a bulk Chern number of 1, but the property of the junction itself is the absence of protected modes.\n\n<<<0>>>"
