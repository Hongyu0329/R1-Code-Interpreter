    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup of the tank.**\n*   The tank has the shape of an icosahedron. An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. It possesses a high degree of symmetry.\n*   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the equilateral triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   A key property of the icosahedron is that for any face, there is an opposite face that is parallel to it. Therefore, if the base face is horizontal, the top face of the icosahedron is also a horizontal equilateral triangle, parallel to the base.\n*   The vertical axis passing through the centers of the base and top faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret what \"half-filled with water\" means.**\n*   \"Half-filled\" refers to the volume. The volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   The icosahedron has a center of symmetry (also known as a point of inversion). Any plane that passes through this geometric center will divide the icosahedron into two identical parts of equal volume.\n*   The water surface is always horizontal. To have half the volume filled, the water level must be at a height that corresponds to a horizontal plane passing through the icosahedron's center.\n*   This central horizontal plane is located exactly midway between the base face and the top face.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the shape of the water surface.**\n*   The question asks for the shape of the water surface. This is the shape of the cross-section created by cutting the icosahedron with the horizontal plane passing through its center.\n*   We can determine the shape of this cross-section by considering the symmetries of the icosahedron in this specific orientation.\n*   **Symmetry Argument 1 (Rotational Symmetry):** As established, the vertical axis is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry (C₃). This means that if you rotate the icosahedron by 120° or 240° around this axis, it looks the same. The cutting plane is perpendicular to this axis, so the resulting 2D cross-section must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry Argument 2 (Inversion Symmetry):** The icosahedron has a center of inversion, and the cutting plane passes through it. This means the resulting cross-section must also be centrally symmetric (have 2-fold rotational symmetry, C₂). Any point on the perimeter of the shape has a corresponding point directly opposite through the center.\n*   **Combining Symmetries:** A geometric figure that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry about the same center must have 6-fold rotational symmetry (C₆).\n*   A polygon with 6-fold rotational symmetry must be a regular hexagon. The vertices of the shape will be equally spaced around the center, and all side lengths and interior angles will be identical.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm with a structural view (optional but helpful).**\n*   The 12 vertices of the icosahedron, when oriented on a face, are arranged in four horizontal layers of three vertices each. Let's call them the bottom layer, the lower-middle layer, the upper-middle layer, and the top layer.\n*   The central horizontal plane (the water surface) passes exactly between the two middle layers (the lower-middle and upper-middle layers).\n*   Therefore, this plane does not pass through any vertices. Instead, it must cut through the edges that connect vertices from the upper half to vertices in the lower half. Specifically, it cuts the edges connecting the upper-middle layer to the lower-middle layer.\n*   There are exactly 6 such edges. The intersection of the plane with these 6 edges creates 6 vertices for the cross-sectional polygon.\n*   Thus, the shape is a hexagon. Combined with the symmetry argument, we can be confident it is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhen an icosahedron standing on a face is half-filled, the water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center. The intersection of this plane with the icosahedron forms a cross-section. Due to the symmetries of the icosahedron, this cross-section is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
