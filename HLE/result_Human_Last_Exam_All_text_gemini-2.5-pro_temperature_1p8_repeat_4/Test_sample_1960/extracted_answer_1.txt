*   **Function f:** `f(w) = (1 \multimap \bot)^{\otimes w}`.
    *   This is defined as `1` if `w=0`.
    *   For `w > 0`, it is the formula `(1 \multimap \bot)` tensored with itself `w` times.

*   **Formula C:** `C(W, m, b) = ((1 \multimap \bot)^{\otimes b})^{\otimes m}`.
    *   This is the formula `(1 \multimap \bot)^{\otimes b}` tensored with itself `m` times.
