    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Question**\n\n*   **System:** A quantum particle confined to a one-dimensional box of length `a`.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the second energy level, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Question:** What is the probability of finding this particle in the specific interval from `x = 0.495a` to `x = 0.505a`?\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Physics Principles**\n\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   The probability density, `P(x)`, which represents the probability per unit length of finding the particle at a position `x`, is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    $P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   The probability of finding the particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is calculated by integrating the probability density over that interval:\n    $Prob(x_1 \\le x \\le x_2) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} |ψ_n(x)|^2 dx$\n\n**3. Apply the Principles to the Specific Problem**\n\n*   We are given `n = 2`. The probability density function is:\n    $P(x) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   The interval is from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n*   The probability we need to calculate is:\n    $Prob = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n**4. List Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Small Interval:** The length of the interval, `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`, is very small compared to the length of the box `a`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Node at the Center:** The center of the interval is `x = 0.5a`. Let's check the value of the wavefunction and probability density at this point for `n=2`.\n    $ψ_2(0.5a) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin(\\pi) = 0$\n    This means `x = 0.5a` is a node for the `n=2` state. The probability density at the exact center of our interval is zero.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Simple Approximation is Invalid:** Because the probability density is zero at the center of the interval, the simple approximation `Prob ≈ P(x_center) * Δx` would yield a result of 0. This is incorrect because the probability density is non-zero everywhere else in the interval. The probability is small, but not exactly zero. We must perform the full integration.\n\n**5. Perform the Integration**\n\n1.  **Set up the integral:**\n    $Prob = \\frac{2}{a} \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n2.  **Use a trigonometric identity:** To integrate `sin²(θ)`, we use the identity `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2`.\n    Here, `θ = 2πx/a`, so `2θ = 4πx/a`.\n    $Prob = \\frac{2}{a} \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)}{2} dx$\n    $Prob = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) dx$\n\n3.  **Evaluate the antiderivative:**\n    $\\int \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right) dx = x - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n4.  **Apply the limits of integration:**\n    $Prob = \\frac{1}{a} \\left[ x - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\right]_{0.495a}^{0.505a}$\n    $Prob = \\frac{1}{a} \\left\\{ \\left(0.505a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi(0.505a)}{a}\\right)\\right) - \\left(0.495a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi(0.495a)}{a}\\right)\\right) \\right\\}$\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    $Prob = \\frac{1}{a} \\left\\{ (0.505a - 0.495a) - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\sin(4\\pi \\times 0.505) - \\sin(4\\pi \\times 0.495) \\right] \\right\\}$\n    $Prob = \\frac{1}{a} \\left\\{ 0.01a - \\frac{a}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\sin(2.02\\pi) - \\sin(1.98\\pi) \\right] \\right\\}$\n    $Prob = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\sin(2.02\\pi) - \\sin(1.98\\pi) \\right]$\n\n6.  **Evaluate the trigonometric terms:** Use the identities `sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ)` and `sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ)`.\n    *   $\\sin(2.02\\pi) = \\sin(2\\pi + 0.02\\pi) = \\sin(0.02\\pi)$\n    *   $\\sin(1.98\\pi) = \\sin(2\\pi - 0.02\\pi) = -\\sin(0.02\\pi)$\n    Substituting these back into the equation for probability:\n    $Prob = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\sin(0.02\\pi) - (-\\sin(0.02\\pi)) \\right]$\n    $Prob = 0.01 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi} [2\\sin(0.02\\pi)]$\n    $Prob = 0.01 - \\frac{\\sin(0.02\\pi)}{2\\pi}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the final numerical value:** We must use radians for the argument of the sine function.\n    *   $0.02\\pi \\approx 0.062832$ radians\n    *   $\\sin(0.02\\pi) \\approx 0.062791$\n    *   $2\\pi \\approx 6.283185$\n    Now substitute these values into the expression for probability:\n    $Prob \\approx 0.01 - \\frac{0.062791}{6.283185}$\n    $Prob \\approx 0.01 - 0.00999338$\n    $Prob \\approx 0.00000662$\n\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n = 2 is approximately 6.62 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<0.00000662>>>"
