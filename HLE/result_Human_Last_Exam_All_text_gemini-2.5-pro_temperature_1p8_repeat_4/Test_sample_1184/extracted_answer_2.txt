The following provides the specific residues and their positions in the human beta-1 subunit (CavÎ²1b, UniProt: P54283) that act as hotspots for interaction and gating modulation of the human alpha-1 subunit of the Cav2.3 channel.

**1) Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 subunit (Residues for High-Affinity Binding):**

These residues form the core of the Alpha Interaction Domain-Binding Pocket (ABP) in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and are essential for the physical association with the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **From the SH3 Domain 'Hook' Region:**
    *   Leucine-282 (Leu282)
    *   Tyrosine-285 (Tyr285)
*   **From the GK Domain Groove:**
    *   Histidine-357 (His357)
    *   Isoleucine-359 (Ile359)
    *   Tryptophan-437 (Trp437)
    *   Methionine-441 (Met441)
    *   Isoleucine-498 (Ile498)

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Residues for Gating Modulation):**

These residues or regions are critical for the allosteric regulation of the alpha-1 subunit's function. Mutations here typically alter gating properties (like activation voltage or inactivation speed) more significantly than they affect binding affinity.

*   **From the N-Terminal Domain:**
    *   **The entire proximal N-terminal region (approximately residues 4-13):** This region is a major determinant of the hyperpolarizing shift of activation.
    *   **Methionine-10 (Met10):** A specific, well-characterized residue within the N-terminus where mutation severely attenuates the shift in voltage-dependent activation.
*   **From the Conserved Core (Allosteric Transduction):**
    *   **Aspartate-243 (Asp243):** Located in the SH3 domain; influences inactivation kinetics.
    *   **Glutamate-277 (Glu277):** Located on the 'hook' region at the periphery of the binding pocket; involved in transducing the gating signal.
    *   **Asnparagine-279 (Asn279):** Also located on the 'hook' region and involved in gating modulation.
    *   **Valine-375 (Val375):** Located at the interface between the SH3 and GK domains; important for the correct intramolecular conformation required for modulation.
