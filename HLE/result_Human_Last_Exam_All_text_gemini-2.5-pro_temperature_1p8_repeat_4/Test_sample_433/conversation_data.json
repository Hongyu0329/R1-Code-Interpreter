    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** The question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n    *   **For What:** A \"single-dose container ampule.\" This specific container type is the most critical part of the question.\n    *   **When:** \"From the time of puncture.\" For an ampule, this means from the time it is broken open.\n    *   **Where:** \"In a sterile environment.\" This typically refers to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Standard:**\n    The primary source for rules on sterile compounding and medication handling in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically Chapter <797> on \"Pharmaceutical Compounding – Sterile Preparations.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Container Type (Ampule):**\n    USP <797> has very specific rules that differentiate between container types.\n    *   An **ampule** is a sealed glass container that is broken at the neck to open.\n    *   Once opened, an ampule is an **open system**. It cannot be resealed.\n    *   This open system is highly susceptible to microbial contamination from the surrounding air, even within the controlled \"sterile environment\" of a hood.\n\n4.  **Apply the USP <797> Rule for Ampules:**\n    The guideline for ampules is explicit and strict due to the high contamination risk.\n    *   USP <797> states that **opened ampules must not be stored for any period of time.**\n    *   The contents must be withdrawn and used **immediately** after the ampule is opened.\n    *   Any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be discarded right away. It cannot be saved for later use.\n\n5.  **Distinguish from Other Single-Dose Containers (e.g., Vials):**\n    It is crucial to differentiate ampules from single-dose vials, as the rules are different.\n    *   A single-dose **vial** has a rubber stopper that reseals after being punctured by a needle.\n    *   According to USP <797> (2022 revision), a single-dose vial that has been punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment can be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture.\n    *   This extended time does **not** apply to ampules because they cannot be resealed.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the \"BUD\":**\n    For an opened ampule, the concept of a Beyond-Use Date for storage is not applicable because storage is prohibited. The \"use-by\" time is immediate. The entire process—opening the ampule, withdrawing the contents, and using it (either for direct administration or as part of a compounded sterile preparation)—must be performed as one continuous action.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Container Type is Key:** The most important detail is that the container is an **ampule**, not a vial. Misinterpreting this would lead to a completely different and incorrect answer.\n*   **\"Puncture\" vs. \"Opened\":** While the question uses the word \"puncture,\" ampules are broken open. The intent is the same: the moment the sterile seal is compromised.\n*   **Immediate Means Immediate:** This is not an arbitrary term. It signifies that the opened ampule cannot be set aside in the hood to be used later, not even for a few minutes. It must be used and then discarded.\n*   **No Storage Permitted:** The final answer is not a time duration (e.g., \"1 hour\"). The core principle is that storage of an opened ampule is never allowed. Any unused drug must be wasted.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the definitive guidelines from USP <797>, which prioritize patient safety by minimizing contamination risk, an opened ampule must be used immediately. Its inability to be resealed makes it an open system, and therefore, it cannot be stored.\n\n<<<An opened ampule cannot be stored and must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded right away. Therefore, a storage BUD does not apply."
