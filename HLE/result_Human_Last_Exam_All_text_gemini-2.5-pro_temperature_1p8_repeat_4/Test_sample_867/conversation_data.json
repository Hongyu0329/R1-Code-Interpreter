    "To answer this question accurately, a step-by-step analysis of the specific performance is required.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identifying the Subject of Analysis**\n\n*   **Production:** Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake*.\n*   **Year:** The widely available recording is from the 2014-2015 season, filmed in January 2015 and broadcast globally.\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich.\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova as Odette.\n*   **Scene:** The Odette variation (solo) in Act II (the \"White Swan\" act).\n*   **Ballet Step:** *Sissone fermée*.\n\n**2. Defining the Ballet Step: *Sissone Fermée***\n\nBefore counting, it is crucial to understand the step itself to avoid confusion with other similar-looking jumps.\n*   **Sissone:** A type of jump that begins from two feet.\n*   **Fermée:** French for \"closed.\"\n*   **Execution:** A *sissone fermée* is a jump that takes off from two feet in fifth position and lands on one foot, with the other foot quickly sliding in to \"close\" into fifth position *demi-plié*. In this variation, they are performed traveling forward (*en avant*).\n\n**3. Analyzing the Choreography of the Variation**\n\nThe Odette variation in Grigorovich's choreography can be broken down into several distinct phrases. We need to watch the entire solo to count every instance of the specified step.\n\n*   **Phrase 1: The Opening Diagonal**\n    *   The variation begins with Odette at the back of the stage (upstage).\n    *   She travels diagonally forward across the stage.\n    *   This opening phrase consists of a series of the signature step in question.\n    *   Watching Svetlana Zakharova's performance, we can carefully count each jump that fits the definition of a *sissone fermée* (jump from two feet, landing closed).\n    *   **Count:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n    *   She performs exactly **seven** *sissone fermées* in this initial traveling sequence.\n\n*   **Phrase 2: Center Work**\n    *   Following the diagonal, Zakharova performs a series of steps in the center of the stage.\n    *   This section includes slow *développés* (leg extensions), *pas de bourrée*, and *piqué* turns.\n    *   This phrase does not contain any *sissone fermées*.\n\n*   **Phrase 3: Second Traveling Sequence and Finale**\n    *   After the center work, she performs another quick traveling phrase across the stage.\n    *   These jumps are different; they are a series of small *jetés* which take off from one foot, not two. Therefore, they are not *sissones*.\n    *   The variation concludes with a final sequence of turns and a final pose.\n    *   No *sissone fermées* are performed in this final section either.\n\n**4. Final Count**\n\nBy analyzing the entire solo phrase by phrase, we can establish that the *sissone fermées* are only present in the first diagonal traveling sequence. The number performed in that sequence is seven.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Specificity of Performance:** The count is specific to the 2014 Grigorovich production with Zakharova. Different choreographies or even different performances by the same dancer can have variations.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** It is critical to distinguish the *sissone fermée* (takeoff from two feet, lands closed) from other ballet jumps like the *jeté* (takeoff from one foot) that appear later in the same variation.\n*   **Complete Viewing:** The entire solo must be analyzed to ensure no other instances of the step are performed in later sections of the choreography.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the specified performance, Svetlana Zakharova performs a single sequence of *sissone fermées*. This sequence consists of 7 repetitions of the step.\n\n<<<7>>>"
