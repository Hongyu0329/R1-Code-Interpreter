A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if its Sylow p-subgroups do not belong to specific families of non-filled p-groups. A finite nilpotent group is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, G ≅ P₁ × P₂ × ⋯ × Pₖ. The group G is filled if and only if each Sylow subgroup Pᵢ is filled.

The classification for a p-group P to be filled is as follows:
1.  If p = 2, P must not be a generalized quaternion group Q₂ₙ for any n ≥ 3.
2.  If p is a Fermat prime (a prime of the form 2²ᵏ + 1, i.e., 3, 5, 17, 257, ...), P must not be a cyclic group Cₚⁿ for any n ≥ 2. For example, C₉, C₂₇, C₂₅, etc., are not filled.
3.  If p is a prime that is not a Fermat prime (e.g., 7, 11, 13, ...), then any p-group P is filled.

In summary, a finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if none of its Sylow subgroups are a generalized quaternion group or a cyclic group of order pⁿ where p is a Fermat prime and n ≥ 2.
