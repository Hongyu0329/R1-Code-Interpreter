    "This problem requires a multi-step analysis, starting with the definitions and progressively narrowing down the class of groups in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n1.  **Product-Free Set:** A subset `A` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `a, b ∈ A` (possibly `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `A`. This can be stated succinctly as `A A ∩ A = ∅`, where `AA = {ab | a, b ∈ A}`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The identity element `e` can never be in a non-empty product-free set, because if `e ∈ A`, then `e * e = e`, which would also have to be in `A`, violating the definition.\n\n2.  **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (or Maximal Product-Free Set):** This is a product-free set `M` such that it cannot be extended by adding any new element without losing the product-free property. Formally, for any `g ∈ G \\ M`, the set `M ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n3.  **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal product-free sets covers the entire group.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** As noted in Careful Point 1, the identity element `e` is never in any product-free set. Therefore, `e` cannot be in any *maximal* product-free set. This means for `G` to be filled in the literal sense (`⋃ M_i = G`), `G` would have to be the trivial group `{e}`. For the trivial group, the only product-free set is the empty set `∅`, which is maximal. The union is `∅`, which is not `{e}`. Thus, the definition of a filled group is conventionally understood to mean that the union of all maximal product-free sets is `G \\ {e}`. So, a group `G` is filled if every non-identity element belongs to at least one maximal product-free set.\n\n4.  **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. That is, if `|G| = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ... p_k^{a_k}` and `P_i` is a Sylow `p_i`-subgroup, then `G ≅ P_1 × P_2 × ... × P_k`. This decomposition is the key tool for analyzing nilpotent groups.\n\n**Step 2: The Role of Direct Products**\n\nLet `G = H × K` where `H` and `K` are groups with coprime orders (which is the case for the Sylow decomposition of a nilpotent group). We can analyze the maximal product-free sets of `G` in terms of those of `H` and `K`.\n\n*   Let `M_H` be a maximal product-free set in `H`. Consider the set `M_H × K = {(h, k) | h ∈ M_H, k ∈ K}` in `G`.\n*   This set is product-free: take `(h_1, k_1)` and `(h_2, k_2)` from `M_H × K`. Their product is `(h_1 h_2, k_1 k_2)`. Since `M_H` is product-free in `H`, `h_1 h_2 ∉ M_H`. Therefore, `(h_1 h_2, k_1 k_2) ∉ M_H × K`.\n*   This set is also maximal. Any element not in `M_H × K` is of the form `(h', k')` where `h' ∉ M_H`. Since `M_H` is maximal in `H`, `M_H ∪ {h'}` is not product-free. This implies there exist elements `x, y ∈ M_H ∪ {h'}` such that `xy ∈ M_H ∪ {h'}`. This relationship can be lifted to `G` to show that `(M_H × K) ∪ {(h', k')}` is not product-free.\n*   By a symmetric argument, if `M_K` is a maximal product-free set in `K`, then `H × M_K` is a maximal product-free set in `G`.\n\nNow, suppose `G` is a filled group. Let `⋃_i M_i = G \\ {e_G}`. If `H` and `K` are also filled, then the union of maximal sets in `G` contains `( (⋃ M_H) × K ) ∪ ( H × (⋃ M_K) )`. Since `H` and `K` are filled, this union becomes `( (H \\ {e_H}) × K ) ∪ ( H × (K \\ {e_K}) )`. This set consists of all pairs `(h, k)` where `h ≠ e_H` or `k ≠ e_K`, which is precisely `G \\ {(e_H, e_K)} = G \\ {e_G}`. This shows that if `H` and `K` are filled, then `H × K` is filled.\n\nThe converse is also true: if `H × K` is filled, then `H` and `K` must be filled.\nTherefore, a finite nilpotent group `G = P_1 × ... × P_k` is filled if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups `P_i` is filled.\n\n**Step 3: Characterizing Filled p-Groups**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to classifying which finite p-groups are filled. This is a non-trivial result from group theory and additive combinatorics. The classification relies on identifying p-groups that contain non-identity elements which cannot be placed in any maximal product-free set. According to research in this area (notably by A. Lucchini, C. Roney-Dougal, and others building on earlier work), the non-filled p-groups are very specific.\n\nA finite `p`-group `P` is **filled** if and only if it is **NOT** a member of the following two families of groups:\n\n1.  **The Generalized Quaternion Groups:** `Q_{2^n} = <x, y | x^{2^{n-1}}=e, y^2=x^{2^{n-2}}, y^{-1}xy=x^{-1}>` for `n ≥ 3`. This includes the quaternion group `Q_8` (`n=3`), `Q_{16}` (`n=4`), and so on.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** Note that `Q_4` is not a standard group, and `Q_8` (`n=3`) is the smallest member of this family. For `p≠2`, there are no such exceptions. So, any p-group for odd `p` that isn't in the next family is filled.\n\n2.  **Certain Cyclic p-Groups:** `C_{p^n}` where `p` is a Fermat prime and `n ≥ 2`.\n    *   A **Fermat prime** is a prime number of the form `2^(2^k) + 1`. The known Fermat primes are 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537.\n    *   **Let's analyze this condition:**\n        *   If `p=3` (which is a Fermat prime), `C_{3^n}` is NOT filled for `n ≥ 2`. This means `C_9, C_{27}, C_{81}, ...` are not filled. However, `C_3` is filled.\n        *   If `p=5` (a Fermat prime), `C_{5^n}` is NOT filled for `n ≥ 2`. So `C_{25}, C_{125}, ...` are not filled. `C_5` is filled.\n        *   If `p` is a prime that is **not** a Fermat prime (e.g., `p = 2, 7, 11, 13, ...`), then this condition does not apply. All cyclic p-groups `C_{p^n}` for these primes are filled.\n    *   **Careful Point 4:** The condition for `p=2` is only the generalized quaternion one. `p=2` is not a Fermat prime, so all cyclic 2-groups (`C_2, C_4, C_8, ...`) are filled.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the results of Step 2 and Step 3, we can characterize the finite filled nilpotent groups. A finite nilpotent group `G` is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. `G` is filled if and only if none of its Sylow subgroups are on the list of non-filled p-groups.\n\nThe finite filled nilpotent groups are those groups `G` such that in their Sylow decomposition `G ≅ P_1 × P_2 × ... × P_k`:\n\n*   For each Sylow 2-subgroup `P_i`, `P_i` is not a generalized quaternion group `Q_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 3`.\n*   For each Sylow p-subgroup `P_i` where `p` is a Fermat prime (3, 5, 17,...), `P_i` is not a cyclic group `C_{p^n}` with `n ≥ 2`.\n*   Sylow subgroups for primes that are not Fermat primes (7, 11, 13,...) can be any p-group.\n\nThis provides a complete classification.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if its Sylow p-subgroups do not belong to specific families of non-filled p-groups. A finite nilpotent group is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, G ≅ P₁ × P₂ × ⋯ × Pₖ. The group G is filled if and only if each Sylow subgroup Pᵢ is filled.\n\nThe classification for a p-group P to be filled is as follows:\n1.  If p = 2, P must not be a generalized quaternion group Q₂ₙ for any n ≥ 3.\n2.  If p is a Fermat prime (a prime of the form 2²ᵏ + 1, i.e., 3, 5, 17, 257, ...), P must not be a cyclic group Cₚⁿ for any n ≥ 2. For example, C₉, C₂₇, C₂₅, etc., are not filled.\n3.  If p is a prime that is not a Fermat prime (e.g., 7, 11, 13, ...), then any p-group P is filled.\n\nIn summary, a finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if none of its Sylow subgroups are a generalized quaternion group or a cyclic group of order pⁿ where p is a Fermat prime and n ≥ 2.>>>"
