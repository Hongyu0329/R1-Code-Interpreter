    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the origin of the current word \"sister\".**\nThe Modern English word \"sister\" does not come directly from its Old English ancestor. It is a borrowing from the Old Norse word *systir*. The Norse (Viking) invasions and settlements in England from the 8th to the 11th centuries led to a significant infusion of Old Norse words into the English language. The native English word and the Norse word were very similar, but over time the Norse form, *systir*, influenced and eventually replaced the original English one in the standard language.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the original Old English word.**\nThe native Old English word for \"sister\" was *sweostor*. It also had a common variant form, *swuster*. Both the Old English *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir* descended from the same Proto-Germanic root, **\\*swestēr**, which is why they were so similar.\n\n**Step 3: Hypothesize the word's development without Norse influence.**\nTo figure out what the modern word would be, we need to trace the natural phonetic evolution of the Old English word *sweostor*/*swuster* into Modern English, applying the sound changes that affected other native English words.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the path from Old English to Middle English.**\n*   The Old English form *sweostor* likely would have evolved, but the variant *swuster* gives us a clearer path. This form was already present in some Old English dialects.\n*   In the transition to Middle English, this form *swuster* simplified into *suster*. We have strong evidence for this, as the word \"suster\" was the most common form throughout the Middle English period, used by authors like Chaucer. The initial \"sw-\" sound simplified to \"s-\", a change that also happened in related languages like Dutch (*zuster*) and Frisian (*suster*).\n\n**Step 5: Trace the path from Middle English to Modern English.**\n*   Starting with the Middle English form *suster* (pronounced roughly \"soos-ter\").\n*   The key sound change here is the \"STRUT-split\" or \"short u unrounding\". In early Modern English, the short 'u' sound, pronounced /ʊ/ (as in \"put\"), shifted to the sound /ʌ/ (as in \"cut\") in most words.\n*   We see this change in countless native words: Middle English *sone* /sʊnə/ became \"son\" /sʌn/; Middle English *come* /kʊmə/ became \"come\" /kʌm/.\n*   Applying this change to *suster* /ˈsʊstər/, the vowel sound in the first syllable would change from /ʊ/ to /ʌ/.\n*   The final \"-er\" syllable, being unstressed, would be pronounced with a schwa (/ə/), just as it is in the modern word \"sister\".\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the final form.**\nFollowing the natural path of linguistic development for native English words, the Middle English *suster* would have evolved into a Modern English word spelled and pronounced **\"suster\"** (pronounced /'sʌstər/). This form did survive for a long time in various English dialects not as heavily influenced by the Norse-heavy dialect that became Standard English.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
