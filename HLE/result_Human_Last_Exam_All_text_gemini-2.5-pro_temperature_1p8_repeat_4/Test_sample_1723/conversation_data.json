    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a **single genus** of mushroom that is specifically **known** for producing a **distinctly blue spore print**.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   Many mushrooms have blue coloration. A common example is the \"bluing bolete\" (*Gyroporus cyanescens*), which turns blue when bruised or cut. However, its spore print is pale yellow.\n    *   Another famous blue mushroom is *Lactarius indigo* (now correctly placed in the genus *Lactifluus*). This mushroom has blue flesh and exudes a blue \"milk\" or latex. This is a very strong characteristic, but its spore print is cream to yellowish, not blue.\n    *   The Sky Blue mushroom of New Zealand, *Entoloma hochstetteri*, is brilliantly blue, but its spore print is pink. The blue color is due to pigments in the mushroom's flesh.\n\n3.  **Careful Point 1: Spore Print vs. Mushroom Color:** The question is specifically about the color of the spore print (the collected spores), not the color of the mushroom's cap, stem, or flesh. This is the most critical distinction to make. True blue spore prints are exceptionally rare in the fungal kingdom.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 2: The Meaning of \"Known\":** The question asks for a genus that is \"known\" for this feature. This implies it might be a well-established piece of mycological knowledge, not necessarily a recent or obscure discovery.\n\n5.  **Investigating Candidates:**\n    *   **Entoloma:** This genus has a characteristic pink, angular spore print. It is not the answer.\n    *   **Cortinarius:** This is a massive genus with a rusty-brown spore print. Some species can have a fleeting lilac or violaceous color on the gills from the cortina (veil), which might tinge a very fresh print, but this is not a distinct blue print. It is not the answer.\n    *   **Lactifluus:** This is the genus containing the indigo milk caps. While the most famous species (*Lactifluus indigo*) does not have a blue spore print, other species within the genus are reported to have spores that create a white spore print with a \"clear bluish reflection\" or \"pale bluish violet\" tint (e.g., *Lactifluus violascens*). Given that the entire group (Section *Lactifluus*) is defined by its production of blue latex, it is the genus most strongly and famously associated with the color blue extending to its reproductive elements.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** While a technically perfect, sky-blue spore print is found in the very obscure, recently described African genus *Rugosospora*, the question asks for a genus that is \"known\" for this trait. The genus **Lactifluus** is world-famous for its blue members (the indigo milk caps), and some species within it are documented to produce spores with distinct bluish tints or reflections, making it the most plausible and well-known answer to the question.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis, the genus most famously associated with blue coloration that extends to reports of blueish spore prints is *Lactifluus*.\n\n<<<Lactifluus>>>"
