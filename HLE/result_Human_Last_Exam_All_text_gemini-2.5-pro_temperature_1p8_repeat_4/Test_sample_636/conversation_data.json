    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given a linear time-invariant system described by the state-space matrices:\n*   `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system `A_cl = A - BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. For the desired eigenvalues `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`, the desired characteristic polynomial `α_c(λ)` is:\n`α_c(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)`\n`α_c(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`α_c(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a² - b²`:\n`α_c(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j²`\nSince `j² = -1`:\n`α_c(λ) = (λ² + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`α_c(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\nSo, the desired characteristic equation is `λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Closed-Loop System's Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe state feedback law is `u = -Fx`. The closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A - BF`.\nSince `A` is 2x2 (n=2 states) and `B` is 2x2 (m=2 inputs), the feedback gain matrix `F` must be 2x2. Let's define `F` as:\n`F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n\nNow, we calculate `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[1*f₁ + 2*f₃, 1*f₂ + 2*f₄], [1*f₁, 1*f₂]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n\nNext, we calculate the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] - [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 - f₁ - 2f₃, 1 - f₂ - 2f₄], [1 - f₁, -f₂]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system is `det(λI - A_cl)`.\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ, 0], [0, λ]] - [[-1 - f₁ - 2f₃, 1 - f₂ - 2f₄], [1 - f₁, -f₂]]`\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ + 1 + f₁ + 2f₃, -1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [-1 + f₁, λ + f₂]]`\n\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ + 1 + f₁ + 2f₃)(λ + f₂) - (-1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(-1 + f₁)`\n`= λ² + λf₂ + (1 + f₁ + 2f₃)λ + f₂(1 + f₁ + 2f₃) - (1 - f₁ - f₂ + f₁f₂ - 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)`\n`= λ² + (1 + f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃)λ + (f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 1 + f₁ + f₂ - f₁f₂ + 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)`\n`= λ² + (1 + f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃)λ + (-1 + f₁ + 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ + 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)`\n\n**Step 4: Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients of our calculated characteristic polynomial with the desired one (`λ² + 2λ + 2`).\n\n1.  **Coefficient of λ:**\n    `1 + f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = 2`\n    `f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = 1`  (Equation 1)\n\n2.  **Constant term:**\n    `-1 + f₁ + 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ + 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2`\n    `f₁ + 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ + 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns. This means the solution for `F` is not unique, which is expected for multi-input systems. We have the freedom to choose values for two of the variables to find a specific solution.\n\nA simple choice is to set one of the rows of `F` to zero. This is equivalent to using only one of the system's inputs for feedback control. Let's set the second row of `F` to zero, meaning `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`.\n\nSubstituting `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0` into our equations:\n\n*   Equation 1 becomes:\n    `f₁ + f₂ + 2(0) = 1`\n    `f₁ + f₂ = 1`\n\n*   Equation 2 becomes:\n    `f₁ + 2f₂ + 2f₂(0) + 2(0) - 2f₁(0) = 3`\n    `f₁ + 2f₂ = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations:\nA) `f₁ + f₂ = 1`\nB) `f₁ + 2f₂ = 3`\n\nSubtracting equation (A) from (B):\n`(f₁ + 2f₂) - (f₁ + f₂) = 3 - 1`\n`f₂ = 2`\n\nSubstitute `f₂ = 2` back into equation (A):\n`f₁ + 2 = 1`\n`f₁ = -1`\n\nSo, we have found `f₁ = -1`, `f₂ = 2`, `f₃ = 0`, and `f₄ = 0`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[-1, 2], [0, 0]]`\n\nThis is one possible solution. Other solutions exist by making different choices for the free variables.\n\n<<<F = [[-1, 2], [0, 0]]>>>"
