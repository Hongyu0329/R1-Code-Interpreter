    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most memory-efficient C program for the given problem and calculate the total memory used for its variables.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Analysis\nThe goal is to read a string representing a sum of numbers (specifically 1, 2, 3, and 4), sort these numbers in non-decreasing order, and print the new sum. The primary constraint is to achieve this with the minimum possible memory usage for variables in a C program.\n\n**Input:** A string `s` like \"3+2+1+4+1\".\n**Output:** The rearranged string \"1+1+2+3+4\".\n**Constraints:**\n*   Input contains only digits '1', '2', '3', '4' and the '+' character.\n*   Input string length is at most 1000 characters.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points for Memory Efficiency\n1.  **Algorithm Choice:** The numbers to be sorted are from a very small and fixed set {1, 2, 3, 4}. This is a classic scenario for **Counting Sort**, which is highly efficient in both time and space. Instead of storing all the numbers in a large array and then sorting, we can simply count the occurrences of each number.\n2.  **Input Handling:** The problem states \"The first line contains a non-empty string s\". This phrasing suggests that the standard approach is to read the entire string into a character buffer first, rather than processing it character-by-character with `getchar()`, which would otherwise save significant memory by avoiding the buffer. We will adhere to the standard interpretation and use a buffer.\n3.  **Data Types:** To minimize memory, we must select the smallest possible data type for each variable that can safely hold the required range of values.\n    *   For counters and loop variables, `int` (typically 4 bytes) is often overkill. We should consider `char` (1 byte) or `short` (2 bytes) if their ranges are sufficient.\n4.  **Auxiliary Variables:** We should avoid creating unnecessary variables. For example, storing the length of the string in a variable (`len`) can be avoided by checking for the null terminator `\\0` in the loop condition.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer (Memory Calculation)\n\nWe will design the program logic and calculate the memory required for each variable.\n\n1.  **Input Buffer (`s`):**\n    *   The problem specifies the input string `s` can be up to 1000 characters long.\n    *   To store this string in C, we need a `char` array of size 1001 to accommodate the 1000 characters plus the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   `char s[1001];`\n    *   Memory = `1001 * sizeof(char)` = `1001 * 1` = **1001 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Count Array (`counts`):**\n    *   We need to count the occurrences of four numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 4. An array of size 4 is perfect for this.\n    *   The maximum length of the string is 1000. The maximum number of terms in the sum is `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 500.5`, so at most 500 numbers. The highest possible count for any single number is 500.\n    *   A `char` type (range 0 to 255 for unsigned) is too small.\n    *   A `short` type (range -32,768 to 32,767) is sufficient and more memory-efficient than an `int`.\n    *   `short counts[4];`\n    *   Memory = `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Loop Variables (`i`, `j`):**\n    *   We need a loop to iterate through the input string `s` to count the numbers. The index `i` will go up to a maximum of 998. `for (i = 0; s[i] != '\\0'; i += 2)`\n    *   We need another nested loop for printing. The outer loop index (we can reuse `i`) goes from 0 to 3. The inner loop index `j` will go up to the maximum count of a number, which is 500.\n    *   For both `i` and `j`, a `short` is the most memory-efficient sufficient type.\n    *   `short i;` -> Memory = `sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n    *   `short j;` -> Memory = `sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\n4.  **Flag for Printing (`first`):**\n    *   To correctly print the '+' signs (i.e., not before the first number), we need a flag.\n    *   A boolean flag can be implemented with the smallest integer type, which is `char`.\n    *   `char first;`\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nLet's sum the memory usage of all variables required for the most memory-efficient implementation.\n\n*   Input buffer `s`: 1001 bytes\n*   Counters `counts`: 8 bytes\n*   Loop variable `i`: 2 bytes\n*   Loop variable `j`: 2 bytes\n*   Printing flag `first`: 1 byte\n\nTotal memory `m` = 1001 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 1014 bytes.\n\n<<<1014>>>"
