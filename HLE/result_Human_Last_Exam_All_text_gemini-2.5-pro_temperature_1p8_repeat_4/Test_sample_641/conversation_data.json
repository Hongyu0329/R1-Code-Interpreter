    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2, i.e., an element `x` such that `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`. We want to find the number of involutions in the group G = PSU(4, 997).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Group PSU(n, q)**\n\nThe group in question is the Projective Special Unitary Group `PSU(n, q)` with parameters `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\n\n1.  **Unitary Group U(n, q):** This is the group of `n x n` matrices `A` with entries in the finite field `GF(q^2)` that preserve a non-degenerate Hermitian form. This is equivalent to the condition `A * A^* = I`, where `A^*` is the conjugate transpose of `A` (transpose and then apply the Frobenius automorphism `x -> x^q`).\n2.  **Special Unitary Group SU(n, q):** This is a subgroup of `U(n, q)` containing matrices with determinant 1. `SU(n, q) = {A ∈ U(n, q) | det(A) = 1}`.\n3.  **Projective Special Unitary Group PSU(n, q):** This group is formed by taking the quotient of `SU(n, q)` by its center, `Z(SU(n, q))`.\n    `PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Center of SU(4, 997)**\n\nThe center `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices `λI` that are in `SU(n, q)`. This requires two conditions on `λ ∈ GF(q^2)`:\n1.  `(λI)(λI)^* = (λI)(λ^q I) = λ^(q+1) I = I`  => `λ^(q+1) = 1`.\n2.  `det(λI) = λ^n = 1`.\n\nThe elements `λ` must satisfy both `λ^n = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`. This means `λ` must be a `d`-th root of unity, where `d = gcd(n, q+1)`. The order of the center is `d`.\n\nFor our group `SU(4, 997)`:\n*   `n = 4`\n*   `q = 997`\n*   `d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998)`\n*   `998 = 2 * 499` (where 499 is a prime number).\n*   `gcd(4, 998) = gcd(2^2, 2 * 499) = 2`.\n\nSo, `|Z(SU(4, 997))| = 2`. The characteristic of the field `GF(997^2)` is 997 (an odd prime), so the two square roots of 1 are `1` and `-1`.\nThe center `Z = Z(SU(4, 997))` is `{I, -I}`.\n\n### **Step 3: Relate Involutions in PSU to Elements in SU**\n\nLet `π: SU(4, q) → PSU(4, q)` be the canonical projection `g ↦ gZ`. An element `t ∈ PSU(4, q)` is an involution if `t ≠ 1` and `t^2 = 1`.\n*   `t = gZ` for some `g ∈ SU(4, q)`.\n*   `t ≠ 1` means `gZ ≠ Z`, which implies `g ∉ Z`.\n*   `t^2 = (gZ)^2 = g^2 Z = Z`, which implies `g^2 ∈ Z`.\n\nTherefore, the preimages in `SU(4, q)` of the involutions in `PSU(4, q)` are the elements `g ∈ SU(4, q)` such that `g ∉ Z` and `g^2 ∈ Z`.\nLet `X = {g ∈ SU(4, q) | g^2 ∈ Z, g ∉ Z}`.\nThe map `π` is a `|Z|`-to-1 mapping from `X` to the set of involutions in `PSU(4, q)`. So, the number of involutions is `|X| / |Z|`.\n\nSince `Z = {I, -I}`, the condition `g^2 ∈ Z` splits into two disjoint cases:\n1.  **Case A:** `g^2 = I`, with `g ∉ {I, -I}`. These are the non-central involutions in `SU(4, q)`.\n2.  **Case B:** `g^2 = -I`. (Note that `g^2 = -I` implies `g ≠ I` and `g ≠ -I`, so `g ∉ Z`).\n\n### **Step 4: Count Elements in Case A (g² = I)**\n\nThese are involutions in `SU(4, q)`. Their conjugacy classes are determined by the dimension, `k`, of their (-1)-eigenspace. Since `g ∈ SU(4, q)`, we must have `det(g) = (-1)^k = 1`, which means `k` must be even. The possible non-zero values for `k` are `k=2` and `k=4`.\n*   **If k=4:** `g` is conjugate to `diag(-1,-1,-1,-1) = -I`. This element is in the center `Z`, so we do not count it.\n*   **If k=2:** `g` is conjugate to `diag(-1,-1,1,1)`. These are the non-central involutions. They form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`.\n\nThe number of such elements is the size of this conjugacy class, which is `|U(4, q)| / |U(2, q) x U(2, q)|`.\n*   `|U(n, q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} * Π_{i=1 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`\n*   `|U(4, q)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n*   `|U(2, q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)`\nThe size of the class is:\n`N_A = |U(4, q)| / |U(2, q)|^2 = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1) / [q(q+1)(q^2-1)]^2`\n`N_A = q^4(q^3+1)(q^4-1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1)) = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n\n### **Step 5: Count Elements in Case B (g² = -I)**\n\nThese are called quasi-involutions.\n*   **Existence:** Such elements `g` exist in `U(n,q)` if `n` is even and `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`. Here, `n=4` (even) and `q=997 = 4*249 + 1`, so `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`. Thus, these elements exist.\n*   **Determinant:** The eigenvalues of `g` are `i` and `-i` (where `i^2=-1`). Since `n=4` is even, say with `m` eigenvalues of `i` and `n-m` eigenvalues of `-i`, the structure of `g` requires `m=n/2=2`. The determinant is `i^2 * (-i)^2 = (-1)(-1) = 1`. So all such elements are in `SU(4, q)`.\n*   **Conjugacy Class:** These elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`. The centralizer of such an element in `U(4,q)` is isomorphic to `GL(2, q^2)`.\n*   **Number of elements:** The size of this class is `|U(4, q)| / |GL(2, q^2)|`.\n    *   `|GL(2, q^2)| = ((q^2)^2 - 1)((q^2)^2 - q^2) = (q^4-1)q^2(q^2-1)`.\n    `N_B = |U(4, q)| / |GL(2, q^2)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1) / [q^2(q^4-1)(q^2-1)]`\n    `N_B = q^4(q+1)(q^3+1) = q^4(q+1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1) = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`\n\n### **Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of preimages is `|X| = N_A + N_B`.\n`|X| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`\n\nFactor out the common term `q^4(q^2-q+1)`:\n`|X| = q^4(q^2-q+1) * [ (q^2+1) + (q+1)^2 ]`\n`|X| = q^4(q^2-q+1) * [ (q^2+1) + (q^2+2q+1) ]`\n`|X| = q^4(q^2-q+1) * [ 2q^2 + 2q + 2 ]`\n`|X| = q^4(q^2-q+1) * 2(q^2+q+1)`\n`|X| = 2q^4 * (q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)`\n\nUsing the identity `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2-b^2` with `a = q^2+1` and `b=q`:\n`|X| = 2q^4 * ((q^2+1)^2 - q^2) = 2q^4 * (q^4 + 2q^2 + 1 - q^2) = 2q^4(q^4+q^2+1)`\n\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is `|X| / |Z| = |X| / 2`.\nNumber of involutions = `[2q^4(q^4+q^2+1)] / 2 = q^4(q^4+q^2+1)`.\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`:\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `997^4(997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`.\n\n<<<997^4(997^4 + 997^2 + 1)>>>"
