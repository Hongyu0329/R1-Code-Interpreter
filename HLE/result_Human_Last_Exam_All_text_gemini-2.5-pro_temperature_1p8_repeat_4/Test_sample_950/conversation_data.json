    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the space:** The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. This is a compact manifold of dimension $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Identify the object of interest:** We are interested in the integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, which is a graded abelian group: $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Identify the torsion subgroup:** Let $R = H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. We need to find its torsion subgroup, $T(R)$. The torsion subgroup of a direct sum of abelian groups is the direct sum of their torsion subgroups. So, $T(R) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 T(H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n4.  **Define the rank:** The question asks for the \"rank of the torsion subgroup\". In standard terminology of abelian group theory, the rank of an abelian group $A$ is the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the rank:**\n    *   Let $T$ be the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring.\n    *   By definition, every element $x \\in T$ has finite order, meaning there exists an integer $n > 0$ such that $nx = 0$.\n    *   Consider the tensor product $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. For any simple tensor $x \\otimes q \\in T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ (where $x \\in T, q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$), we can write $q=a/b$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, b\\neq 0$.\n    *   Since $x$ is a torsion element, let its order be $n$. Then $nx=0$.\n    *   We have $x \\otimes q = x \\otimes \\frac{a}{b} = (nx) \\otimes \\frac{a}{nb} = 0 \\otimes \\frac{a}{nb} = 0$.\n    *   Since every element in $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ is a finite sum of simple tensors, every element is zero.\n    *   Therefore, $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q} = \\{0\\}$.\n    *   The dimension of the zero vector space is 0.\n    *   Thus, the rank of the torsion subgroup $T$ is 0.\n\n6.  **Careful points and alternative interpretations:**\n    *   The question might be using the word \"rank\" in a non-standard way, for instance, asking for the number of summands in the primary decomposition of the torsion group. For real Grassmannians, the torsion is exclusively 2-torsion, meaning the torsion subgroup $T$ is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. In this context, \"rank\" could mean the dimension of $T$ as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, which is the number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands. Let's call this the \"2-rank\".\n    *   Calculating this 2-rank, $\\sum_i t_i$ where $H^i \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_i}$, requires detailed knowledge of the cohomology groups.\n    *   The calculation using the Universal Coefficient Theorem $d_i = b_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$ (where $d_i=\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}H^i(;\\mathbb{Z}_2)$) along with Schubert cell counts ($c_i$), reveals inconsistencies among various literature sources for the cohomology of $G(3,5)$.\n    *   For example, my analysis shows $t_6=1$ and $t_5=0$, which contradicts all explicit descriptions of $H^*(G(3,5);\\mathbb{Z})$ that I could find in the literature.\n    *   However, despite these calculation difficulties for an alternative interpretation of the word \"rank\", the standard definition leads to a straightforward and unambiguous answer.\n    *   In a formal mathematical context, one should adhere to standard definitions. The term \"rank of an abelian group\" has a precise, standard meaning. The rank of any torsion group is 0.\n\nConclusion: Based on the standard mathematical definition of the rank of an abelian group, the answer is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
