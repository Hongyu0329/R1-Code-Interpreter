    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Coordinate System and the First Cube\nTo solve this problem, we first need to place the cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's define the first cube, Cube A, as the unit cube with one corner at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its edges aligned with the coordinate axes.\nThe region occupied by Cube A is defined by the inequalities:\n*   $0 \\le x \\le 1$\n*   $0 \\le y \\le 1$\n*   $0 \\le z \\le 1$\nThe side length of this cube is 1, and its volume is $1^3 = 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Shift Vector\nThe problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A by \"1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n*   **Main Diagonal:** For the cube we've defined, a main diagonal connects opposite vertices, for instance, the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the vertex at (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this main diagonal is $\\vec{d} = \\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle$.\n*   **The Shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is best interpreted as being shifted by a vector that is half the length of the main diagonal vector. This is a common phrasing in geometry problems and leads to a clean, symmetric result.\n*   **Shift Vector Calculation:** The shift vector, $\\vec{s}$, is therefore:\n    $\\vec{s} = \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{d} = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle = \\langle \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** An alternative interpretation could be a shift by a distance (length) of 1/2 in the direction of the main diagonal. This would result in a shift vector of $\\frac{1/2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle$. However, the first interpretation is more standard and relates the shift amount (1/2) directly to the geometry of the unit cube.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Second Cube\nCube B is the same as Cube A but shifted by the vector $\\vec{s}$. To find the region occupied by Cube B, we add the shift vector components to the coordinates of Cube A.\nThe region for Cube B is defined by:\n*   $0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\le x \\le 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{1}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{3}{2}$\n*   $0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\le y \\le 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{1}{2} \\le y \\le \\frac{3}{2}$\n*   $0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\le z \\le 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{1}{2} \\le z \\le \\frac{3}{2}$\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Region of Intersection\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region in space that satisfies the inequalities for both Cube A and Cube B simultaneously. We find this by finding the intersection of the coordinate ranges for each axis.\n\n*   **x-axis:** The intersection of the range $[0, 1]$ (from Cube A) and $[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}]$ (from Cube B) is $[\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$.\n*   **y-axis:** The intersection of the range $[0, 1]$ and $[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}]$ is $[\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$.\n*   **z-axis:** The intersection of the range $[0, 1]$ and $[\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}]$ is $[\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$.\n\nThe resulting intersection is a smaller cube defined by:\n*   $\\frac{1}{2} \\le x \\le 1$\n*   $\\frac{1}{2} \\le y \\le 1$\n*   $\\frac{1}{2} \\le z \\le 1$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection\nThe intersection is a cube. The length of each side of this intersection cube can be found by taking the difference between the upper and lower bounds of its coordinate ranges.\n*   Side length = $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the side length cubed:\n*   Volume = $(\\frac{1}{2})^3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
