    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Question**:\n    *   **Scaling Exponent $\\alpha$ for Specific Heat**: Near a continuous phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$, the specific heat $C$ behaves as a power law: $C \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}$. The exponent $\\alpha$ characterizes this singular behavior.\n    *   **Renormalization Group (RG) Theory**: This is the theoretical framework used to understand critical phenomena. It provides a systematic way to calculate critical exponents.\n    *   **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion**: This is a key computational technique within RG theory. It involves performing calculations in a dimension $d = d_c - \\epsilon$, where $d_c$ is the upper critical dimension and $\\epsilon$ is treated as a small expansion parameter.\n    *   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**: This is the dimension at which and above which mean-field theory correctly describes the critical exponents. For the class of models we are considering (like the Ising model, described by $\\phi^4$ theory), the upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$.\n    *   **Spatial Dimension $d=3$**: We need to find the exponent for a three-dimensional system. This means we will set $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$ in our final expression.\n\n2.  **Careful Points to Consider**:\n    *   **Choice of Model**: The question does not specify the universality class (e.g., Ising, XY, Heisenberg). The critical exponents depend on the symmetry of the order parameter, described by the number of components 'n'. The $\\epsilon$-expansion is performed for the general O(n)-symmetric $\\phi^4$ theory. Since a single numerical answer is expected, we will assume the most common and fundamental case: the Ising universality class, which corresponds to $n=1$.\n    *   **Hyperscaling Relation**: The critical exponents are not all independent. The hyperscaling relation $d\\nu = 2 - \\alpha$ provides a direct link between $\\alpha$, the spatial dimension $d$, and the correlation length exponent $\\nu$. This is a crucial tool for our calculation.\n    *   **Order of Expansion**: The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative series. We will work to the leading order (one-loop calculation), which is the standard interpretation of such a question unless specified otherwise.\n    *   **Validity of $\\epsilon=1$**: Using $\\epsilon=1$ in an expansion designed for small $\\epsilon$ is an approximation. However, the $\\epsilon$-expansion surprisingly yields results that are often in reasonable agreement with more precise methods, and the question specifically asks for the result *using* this method.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**Step 1: The Theoretical Basis**\nWe start with the O(n) universality class, described by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian ($\\phi^4$ theory). The upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. The calculation is performed in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Correlation Length Exponent $\\nu$**\nWithin the $\\epsilon$-expansion, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ is calculated by analyzing the RG flow near the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The standard result to the first order in $\\epsilon$ for the inverse of $\\nu$ is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\nu} = 2 - \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\nwhere 'n' is the number of components of the order parameter.\n\n**Step 3: Using the Hyperscaling Relation**\nThe hyperscaling relation connects $\\alpha$ and $\\nu$:\n$$ 2 - \\alpha = d\\nu $$\nWe need to solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = 2 - d\\nu $$\nSubstituting $d=4-\\epsilon$ and the expression for $\\nu$:\n$$ \\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon)\\nu $$\nTo proceed, we express $\\nu$ as a series in $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\nu = \\left(2 - \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{n+2}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right)^{-1} $$\nUsing the Taylor expansion $(1-x)^{-1} \\approx 1+x$ for small $x$:\n$$ \\nu \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{n+2}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right) $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculating $\\alpha$ to First Order in $\\epsilon$**\nNow substitute this expression for $\\nu$ back into the equation for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 2 - (4-\\epsilon) \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{n+2}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right) $$\nWe expand this expression and keep terms up to order $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 2 - \\left(2 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{n+2}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right) $$\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 2 - \\left[ 2 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\cdot 1 \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n$$ \\alpha \\approx -\\left(\\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\epsilon $$\nSimplifying the term in the parenthesis:\n$$ \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2(n+2) - (n+8)}{2(n+8)} = \\frac{2n+4-n-8}{2(n+8)} = \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} $$\nSo, the general expression for $\\alpha$ to first order in $\\epsilon$ is:\n$$ \\alpha = - \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon $$\n\n**Step 5: Obtaining the Final Answer**\nThe problem is set in $d=3$, so we have $\\epsilon = 4-d = 4-3=1$.\nAs discussed, we assume the Ising universality class, for which $n=1$.\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{3}{2(9)} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nThus, the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat in $d=3$ for the Ising model, calculated to leading order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion, is $1/6$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
