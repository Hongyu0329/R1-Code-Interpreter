    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\n*   **What it is:** Trisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a phonological rule in the history of English.\n*   **The Rule:** A long vowel becomes a short (lax) vowel if it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of the word).\n*   **Precondition:** For this rule to apply, the word must have at least three syllables, and the vowel in question must have been historically long.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word**\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Etymology:** From Old English *sūðerne*, which comes from *sūð* (\"south\").\n    *   **Historical Vowel:** The vowel in the first syllable was a long /u:/ (written as <ū>).\n    *   **Syllable Structure:** The Old English form *sū-ðer-ne* had three syllables, placing the long vowel in the antepenultimate position.\n    *   **Modern Pronunciation:** The modern word is `southern` /ˈsʌðərn/. The vowel /ʌ/ is a short vowel.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The long /u:/ was shortened because it was in the third-to-last syllable. `southern` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Etymology:** Related to the verb *derive*, which comes from Latin *dērīvāre*.\n    *   **Historical Vowel:** The root vowel was a long /i:/ (as can still be seen in the modern pronunciation of *derive* /dɪˈraɪv/, where the /aɪ/ diphthong developed from Middle English long /i:/).\n    *   **Syllable Structure:** Adding the suffix `-ative` creates a four-syllable word: `de-riv-a-tive`. The syllable in question (`-riv-`) is now the antepenultimate (third from the end).\n    *   **Modern Pronunciation:** The modern word is `derivative` /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/. The vowel /ɪ/ is a short vowel.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The long /i:/ shortened to /ɪ/ when the suffix was added. `derivative` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Etymology:** Related to the adjective *serene*, from Latin *serēnus*.\n    *   **Historical Vowel:** The vowel in the second syllable of *serene* was a long /e:/ (as heard in the modern pronunciation /səˈriːn/).\n    *   **Syllable Structure:** Adding the suffix `-ity` creates a four-syllable word: `se-ren-i-ty`. The syllable in question (`-ren-`) becomes the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Modern Pronunciation:** The modern word is `serenity` /səˈrɛnəti/. The vowel /ɛ/ is a short vowel.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The long /e:/ shortened to /ɛ/ due to its position in the longer word. `serenity` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Etymology:** From Old French *plaisant*, from the verb *plaisir* (\"to please\"). In Middle English, the word *plesen* (\"to please\") had a long vowel /ɛː/.\n    *   **Historical Vowel:** The vowel was historically long.\n    *   **Syllable Structure:** `pleasant` is a two-syllable word. The rule for trisyllabic laxing (requiring three or more syllables) does not apply.\n    *   **Modern Pronunciation:** The modern word is `pleasant` /ˈplɛzənt/. The vowel /ɛ/ is short.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Although the vowel did shorten, it was due to a different rule called \"pre-cluster shortening\" (shortening before a consonant cluster, here `-sant`). It **has not** undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Etymology:** From Medieval Latin *grātitūdō*, from *grātus* (\"thankful\").\n    *   **Historical Vowel:** The vowel in the Latin root was a long /a:/.\n    *   **Syllable Structure:** The word `gra-ti-tude` has three syllables. The vowel in question is in the antepenultimate syllable.\n    *   **Modern Pronunciation:** The modern word is `gratitude` /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/. The vowel /æ/ is a short vowel.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The historically long vowel shortened because it is in the third-to-last syllable. `gratitude` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Etymology:** From Old English *sceadu*.\n    *   **Historical Vowel:** The vowel in Old English *sceadu* was a short ash, /æ/.\n    *   **Syllable Structure:** A bisyllabic word.\n    *   **Modern Pronunciation:** The modern word is `shadow` /ˈʃædoʊ/. The vowel /æ/ is short.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The vowel was *never long* to begin with. Since trisyllabic laxing is a process that *shortens long vowels*, it could not have possibly applied to a word whose vowel was already short. Therefore, `shadow` **has not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Final Comparison**\nBoth `pleasant` and `shadow` have not undergone trisyllabic laxing. However, `shadow` is the most definitive example. The rule was entirely inapplicable because its core condition—the presence of a long vowel—was never met. For `pleasant`, the vowel was historically long but was shortened by a different phonological rule.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
