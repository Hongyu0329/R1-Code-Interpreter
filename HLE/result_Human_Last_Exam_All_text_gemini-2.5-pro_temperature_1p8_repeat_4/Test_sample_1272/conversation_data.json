    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Context:** The question focuses on Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his military career in Vietnam during the early 15th century. This period primarily covers two major conflicts: the initial Ming conquest of the Hồ Dynasty (1406–1407) and the subsequent Lam Sơn uprising against Ming rule (1418–1427).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Mu Sheng's First Campaign (1406-1407):** Mu Sheng, along with General Zhang Fu, led the Ming invasion of Vietnam (then known as Đại Ngu under the Hồ Dynasty). This campaign was highly successful. The Ming forces decisively defeated the Hồ army, captured the capital, and established direct Chinese rule over Vietnam (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination). Therefore, Mu Sheng did not suffer any major defeat during this initial conquest; it was a major victory for him.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Mu Sheng's Second Campaign (Lam Sơn Uprising):** The search for his \"first major defeat\" must shift to the subsequent conflict, the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi. After years of guerrilla warfare, the Lam Sơn rebels gained significant strength and began defeating Ming forces across the country.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Decisive Year and Battle (1427):** By 1427, the Ming position in Vietnam was dire. The Ming emperor dispatched a massive reinforcement army in two prongs to break the siege of the capital, Đông Quan (modern-day Hanoi).\n    *   The eastern prong was led by General Liu Sheng (柳升). This army was ambushed and annihilated at the Battle of Chi Lăng (in modern Lạng Sơn province).\n    *   The western prong was led by **Mu Sheng**. He advanced from Yunnan province down the Red River valley.\n\n5.  **Identify Mu Sheng's Defeat:** After Liu Sheng's army was destroyed, Lê Lợi was free to concentrate his forces against Mu Sheng's approaching army. The Vietnamese commanders Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả were tasked with stopping Mu Sheng. They engaged his forces at several key locations, most notably **Lãnh Câu (冷溝)** and **Đan Xá (丹舍)**. Mu Sheng's army was defeated in these engagements, and upon learning the catastrophic fate of Liu Sheng's army, his troops' morale completely collapsed. Mu Sheng was forced to abandon his mission and retreat back to Yunnan. This represented the complete failure of the Ming relief effort and was a decisive, major defeat for Mu Sheng personally.\n\n6.  **Locate the Battlefield in Modern Vietnam:** The final step is to determine the modern location of the battles of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá. These battles took place along the route of Mu Sheng's army as it advanced toward the capital. Historical maps and accounts place these locations along the Red River (Sông Hồng) and Lo River (Sông Lô) systems, northwest of Hanoi. This area corresponds to the territory of modern-day **Phú Thọ Province**. For instance, the strategic Lãnh Câu pass is located in what is now the Thanh Ba District of Phú Thọ Province.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish Mu Sheng's successful first campaign from his unsuccessful later one. His \"first major defeat\" was not in his first war in Vietnam.\n*   It's important not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous defeat of Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng Pass, which happened around the same time but in a different location (modern Lạng Sơn Province). Mu Sheng's defeat was a separate event that sealed the fate of the Ming campaign.\n*   The names of historical battle sites need to be accurately mapped to modern administrative divisions (provinces). Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá fall squarely within modern Phú Thọ.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
