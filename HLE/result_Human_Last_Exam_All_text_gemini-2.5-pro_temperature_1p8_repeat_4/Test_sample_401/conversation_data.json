    "This problem asks for the minimum number of a specific substructure (composants) within a particular type of topological space (an indecomposable continuum).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core definitions.**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected Hausdorff topological space. The problem specifies it is not necessarily metric.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. If $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua, then either $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** For any point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$.\n\n**Step 2: Basic properties of composants in an indecomposable continuum.**\n\n1.  The collection of all distinct composants of a continuum $X$ forms a partition of $X$. That is, they are mutually disjoint and their union is $X$.\n2.  If a continuum is decomposable, it has exactly one composant. Conversely, if it has only one composant, it is decomposable.\n3.  Therefore, an indecomposable continuum must have at least two composants.\n4.  A crucial property: In an indecomposable continuum, every composant is a dense subset.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Baire Category Theorem to find a lower bound on the number of composants.**\n\n1.  A continuum, being a compact Hausdorff space, is a Baire space. A Baire space is a topological space in which the intersection of any countable collection of dense open sets is still dense. A key consequence is that a non-empty Baire space cannot be expressed as a countable union of nowhere-dense closed sets (i.e., it cannot be a meagre set).\n2.  A composant $C(x)$ is the union of all proper subcontinua containing $x$. It can be shown that $C(x)$ is the union of a countable ascending chain of proper subcontinua.\n3.  In an indecomposable continuum, every proper subcontinuum is a nowhere-dense set (it is closed and has an empty interior).\n4.  Since a composant is a countable union of such nowhere-dense closed sets, every composant is a meagre set (a set of the first category).\n5.  Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that an indecomposable continuum $X$ has a countable number of composants ($C_1, C_2, C_3, \\dots$).\n6.  Then $X = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} C_n$. We have just established that each $C_n$ is a meagre set. This would mean $X$ is a countable union of meagre sets.\n7.  By the Baire Category Theorem, a non-empty Baire space cannot be a countable union of meagre sets. This gives a contradiction.\n8.  Therefore, our assumption must be false. The number of composants in an indecomposable continuum cannot be countable. It must be uncountable.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the precise number of composants.**\n\nThe analysis so far shows the number of composants must be uncountable. The smallest uncountable cardinal number is $\\aleph_1$. So, the number of composants is at least $\\aleph_1$. However, a much stronger result exists in continuum theory.\n\n*   **Theorem (Mazurkiewicz for metric spaces, Krasinkiewicz for the general case):** Every indecomposable continuum (metric or not) has exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants.\n\nThis is a deep and non-trivial theorem. It states that the number of composants is not just uncountable, but is always equal to a specific cardinal number, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final answer.**\n\nAccording to the theorem mentioned in Step 4, the set of possible values for the number of composants of an indecomposable continuum is the singleton set $\\{\\mathfrak{c}\\}$.\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest number* of composants an indecomposable continuum can have. Since the number is always $\\mathfrak{c}$, the smallest possible number is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe symbol $\\mathfrak{c}$ represents the cardinality of the set of real numbers, which is equal to $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
