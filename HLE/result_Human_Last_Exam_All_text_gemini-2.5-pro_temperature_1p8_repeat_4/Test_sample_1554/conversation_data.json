    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Must belong to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\" of philosophy.\n    *   **Key Contribution:** This philosopher is known for a specific conceptual analysis: \"decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential Polish school of logic and analytic philosophy active between the two World Wars. Key members included its founder Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. They were renowned for their clarity, rigor, and focus on logic, semantics, and epistemology.\n    *   **Hallmark (or Criterion):** In this context, a hallmark (from the German *Merkmal*) is a sign or a characteristic feature that allows us to recognize something or verify a state of affairs. For example, what is the hallmark of truth? What is the hallmark of a scientific theory?\n    *   **Symptoms and Signals:** This is the core distinction.\n        *   A **symptom** is generally understood as a *natural sign*. Its connection to what it signifies is based on a causal law or an observed empirical regularity. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. The connection is discovered, not invented.\n        *   A **signal** is generally understood as a *conventional sign*. Its connection to what it signifies is established by a rule, an agreement, or a definition created by humans. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"dog\" is a signal for the concept of a dog. The connection is stipulated or learned as part of a system (like language or a traffic code).\n\n3.  **Identify the Philosopher:**\n    *   The task is to find which philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School made this particular distinction central to their work. We can review the major figures.\n    *   While many in the school were interested in signs and meaning, the explicit and systematic decomposition of criteria/hallmarks into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" is a signature contribution of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** (1890–1963).\n    *   Ajdukiewicz was a leading logician and epistemologist within the school. He used this distinction extensively in his works on epistemology and the philosophy of language, such as in his influential book *Pragmatic Logic*.\n    *   For Ajdukiewicz, this distinction was a crucial tool for clarifying philosophical problems. By asking whether a proposed criterion for something (e.g., for truth) is supposed to be a symptom or a signal, one can expose ambiguities and advance the discussion. For instance, he analyzed whether certain sensations are symptoms of an external world or if linguistic expressions are merely signals based on meaning-rules.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Specificity:** The question is very specific. It's not just about who discussed signs, but who used this precise \"symptom/signal\" terminology to analyze the notion of a \"hallmark.\"\n*   **School Association:** The philosopher must be correctly identified as a member of the Lviv-Warsaw School. Ajdukiewicz was a student of the school's founder, Twardowski, and a central figure in its development.\n*   **Conceptual Accuracy:** It is important to correctly understand the distinction itself. A symptom relies on a natural (causal or correlational) link, while a signal relies on a conventional (rule-based) link. Ajdukiewicz's analysis hinges on this difference.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposes the notion of a hallmark into symptoms and signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This distinction is a cornerstone of his epistemological and semiotic analyses.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
