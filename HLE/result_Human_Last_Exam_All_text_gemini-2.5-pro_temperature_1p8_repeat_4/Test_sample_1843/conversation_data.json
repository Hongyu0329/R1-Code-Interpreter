    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks for the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ with a specific conductor $N=36036$ and a specific order of $6$.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n1.  **Dirichlet Character:** A homomorphism $\\chi: (\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\to \\mathbb{C}^\\times$.\n2.  **Conductor of a Character:** The smallest integer $d$ such that $\\chi$ is induced by a character modulo $d$.\n3.  **Primitive Character:** A character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ whose conductor is precisely $N$.\n4.  **Order of a Character:** The smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\chi^k$ is the principal character (i.e., $\\chi(n)^k=1$ for all $n$ with $\\gcd(n, N)=1$).\n5.  **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for Characters:** If $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is the prime factorization of $N$, then the group of characters modulo $N$, denoted $\\mathcal{X}_N$, is isomorphic to the direct product of the character groups modulo each prime power factor:\n    $\\mathcal{X}_N \\cong \\mathcal{X}_{p_1^{a_1}} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathcal{X}_{p_r^{a_r}}$.\n    This means any character $\\chi \\pmod N$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  A character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$ is **primitive modulo $N$** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n2.  The **order of $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$** is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n3.  To have $\\text{ord}(\\chi)=6$, we need $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)) = 6$. Since $6=2 \\times 3$, this means:\n    *   The order of each $\\chi_i$ must be a divisor of 6 (i.e., orders can be 1, 2, 3, 6).\n    *   At least one $\\chi_i$ must have an order divisible by 2.\n    *   At least one $\\chi_i$ must have an order divisible by 3.\n4.  The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ (if $d \\mid m$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$. The group of characters modulo a prime power $p^a$ is cyclic for $p$ odd, but not always for $p=2$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N=36036$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the problem**\nWe need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nLet's find the number of available primitive characters for each prime power factor, whose orders are divisors of 6.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each prime power factor**\n\n*   **Conductor $m=4=2^2$**: The group of characters mod 4 is of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one principal character (order 1, conductor 1) and one non-principal character (order 2). A character mod 4 is primitive if its conductor is 4. The principal character is not primitive. The character of order 2 has conductor 4.\n    *   Number of primitive characters: 1. Its order is 2. Since $2 \\mid 6$, this is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (it must have order 2).\n\n*   **Conductor $m=9=3^2$**: The group of characters mod 9 is of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character mod 9 is primitive if it is not induced by a character mod 3. The character group mod 3 has order $\\phi(3)=2$. So a primitive character mod 9 must have an order $d$ such that $d \\mid \\phi(9)=6$ but $d \\nmid \\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   The possible orders for primitive characters are divisors of 6 that are not divisors of 2. These orders are 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$. (Note: All choices have orders divisible by 3).\n\n*   **Conductor $m=7$**: The group of characters mod 7 is of order $\\phi(7)=6$. A character mod 7 is primitive if it is not the principal character (i.e., its order is greater than 1). We need the order to divide 6.\n    *   Possible orders: 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Conductor $m=11$**: The group of characters mod 11 is of order $\\phi(11)=10$. Primitive characters have orders $>1$. We need the order to divide 6.\n    *   Possible primitive orders must divide both 10 and 6. The only such order greater than 1 is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (it must have order 2).\n\n*   **Conductor $m=13$**: The group of characters mod 13 is of order $\\phi(13)=12$. Primitive characters have orders $>1$. We need the order to divide 6.\n    *   Possible orders: 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results**\n\nLet's find the total number of ways to choose one primitive character from each component group, such that its order divides 6.\nNumber of choices = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal tuples = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that for every one of these 100 combinations, the resulting character's order is exactly 6.\nLet the chosen characters be $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ and their orders be $(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$. Let $L = \\text{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$.\n\n1.  **Divisibility by 2:** From our analysis of mod 4, the character $\\chi_4$ must be chosen, and its order is $k_4 = 2$. Thus, $L$ is guaranteed to be divisible by 2.\n2.  **Divisibility by 3:** From our analysis of mod 9, the character $\\chi_9$ must have order $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. In either case, $k_9$ is divisible by 3. Thus, $L$ is guaranteed to be divisible by 3.\n3.  **Conclusion on L:** Since $L$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, $L$ must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\n4.  **Upper Bound on L:** By construction, we only chose characters whose orders divide 6. Thus, $k_m \\mid 6$ for all components $m \\in \\{4, 9, 7, 11, 13\\}$. This implies that their least common multiple, $L$, must also divide 6.\n\nSince $L$ is divisible by 6 and $L$ divides 6, we must have $L=6$.\nThis means every single one of the 100 combinations of primitive characters results in a character of order exactly 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$ is the total number of valid combinations we found.\n\nNumber = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
