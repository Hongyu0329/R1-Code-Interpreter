    "To determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*, we need to perform a careful analysis of the text.\n\n### Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\"\n\nThe first crucial step is to define what \"historical saint\" means in the context of John Milton, a 17th-century Puritan. Milton would not have adhered to the Roman Catholic process of canonization. For him, a \"saint\" (from the Greek *hagios*, \"holy one\") would be any revered, righteous, and divinely chosen individual from biblical history. Therefore, our search should focus on named figures from the Old Testament presented as patriarchs, prophets, or righteous men, who are part of the lineage of salvation history. We will exclude divine beings (God, the Son), angels (Michael, Raphael), and mythological figures. We will also exclude Adam and Eve, who are the central protagonists of the epic rather than historical figures mentioned in retrospect.\n\n### Step 2: A Systematic Search of *Paradise Lost*\n\nThe most likely place to find such names is in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of future human history. However, we must check the entire poem.\n\n*   **Books I-X**: These books primarily deal with the war in Heaven, the creation of the world, and the fall of Man. The main figures are God, the Son, Satan, various angels and demons, and Adam and Eve. A notable exception appears in **Book III**, where God, speaking of the covenant, mentions **Abraham** by name:\n    *   \"...so in his seed / All Nations shall be blest...\" (III.184-185), which is a clear reference, and later Michael explicitly names him.\n\n*   **Book XI**: Michael begins to show Adam the future.\n    *   He describes the story of Cain and **Abel**, though only Abel fits the definition of a saint. Abel is named later in Book XII, but the righteous man whose murder is shown here is clearly him.\n    *   Michael shows Adam a man \"so perfet and so just\" that God takes him to Heaven without him tasting death. This is **Enoch** (XI.665-671).\n    *   Michael then shows Adam the Great Flood and the \"one Son of light / In a dark Age...preacher of Righteousness\" who builds the Ark. This is **Noah** (XI.808-812).\n\n*   **Book XII**: Michael continues his narration of history.\n    *   **Abraham** is explicitly named as the patriarch chosen by God: \"...a chosen Father, ABRAHAM...\" (XII.113).\n    *   **Moses** is named as the great lawgiver who receives the Law on Sinai and leads the Israelites out of Egypt (XII.227-244).\n    *   **Joshua** is named as the successor to Moses: \"...JOSUA whom the Gentiles JESUS call...\" (XII.310).\n    *   **David** is named as the king from whose \"Royal Stock\" the Messiah will come (XII.323).\n    *   **Abel** is explicitly named in this book: \"...th' unrighteous King...shall slay / The Just, and set that murdrous CAIN above his ABEL.\" (XII.325-327)\n\n### Step 3: Compiling and Reviewing the List\n\nBased on the textual evidence, we can compile a definitive list of named historical saints.\n\n1.  **Abraham**: Patriarch, explicitly named in Books III and XII.\n2.  **Enoch**: Righteous man who walked with God, explicitly described and identified in Book XI.\n3.  **Noah**: Builder of the Ark and preacher of righteousness, described and identified in Book XI.\n4.  **Moses**: Prophet and lawgiver, explicitly named in Book XII.\n5.  **Abel**: The first martyr, explicitly named in Book XII.\n6.  **Joshua**: Leader of Israel, explicitly named in Book XII.\n7.  **David**: King and ancestor of the Messiah, explicitly named in Book XII.\n\n### Step 4: Careful Points and Exclusions\n\nIt is important to note who is *not* on the list.\n*   **The Virgin Mary**: She is referred to as \"a Virgin\" who will be the Messiah's mother (XII.368), but she is never mentioned by the name \"Mary.\"\n*   **New Testament Apostles**: Figures like Peter, Paul, and John are referred to collectively as \"Disciples\" or \"Apostles\" who spread the gospel after being filled with the Spirit (XII.485-502), but they are not named individually.\n*   **Old Testament Prophets**: Other major figures like Elijah, Isaiah, or Jeremiah are not mentioned by name. They are covered under the general term \"Prophecie\" or \"Prophets.\"\n*   **Solomon**: He is alluded to as David's \"Son\" who will build the Temple (XII.331), but he is not named.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter a step-by-step analysis of the text of *Paradise Lost* and applying a definition of \"saint\" appropriate to Milton's context, we find exactly seven such figures mentioned by name.\n\n<<<7>>>"
