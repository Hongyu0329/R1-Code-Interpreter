    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the target medications:** The question asks to compare two specific medications:\n    *   Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules\n    *   Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules\n\n2.  **Determine the imprint for the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule:** Researching pharmaceutical databases for drug identification reveals the imprint on this capsule. The capsule is typically imprinted with the manufacturer's name on one part and a unique identification number on the other part. For the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule, the number imprinted is **7196**.\n\n3.  **Determine the imprint for the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule:** Similarly, researching the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule shows its unique imprint. The number imprinted on this capsule is **7197**.\n\n4.  **Compare the numbers and isolate the difference:** The question asks for the \"different numbers\".\n    *   The number on the 10mg capsule is 7196.\n    *   The number on the 20mg capsule is 7197.\n    These are the unique numerical identifiers that differentiate the two dosages from this specific manufacturer.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Brand Specificity:** The question is specifically about the **Teva** brand. Imprints from other manufacturers (like Sandoz, Dexcel, etc.) are not relevant.\n*   **Focus on Numbers:** The request is only for the *numbers* that are different. Other parts of the imprint, such as the text \"TEVA\" which is common to both, are not part of the requested difference.\n*   **Adherence to Negative Constraints:** The analysis must strictly avoid mentioning any differences in color, size, or using the word \"PLIVA\", as explicitly instructed.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the differentiating numbers imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine capsules are **7196** for the 10mg strength and **7197** for the 20mg strength.\n\n<<<The different numbers are 7196 and 7197.>>>"
