    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the starting molecule.**\nThe molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means that out of the six carbons in the glucose molecule, the carbon at position 1 (the aldehyde carbon) and the carbon at position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. The other carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are the standard ¹²C isotope.\n\nGlucose structure and numbering:\n`¹³C1(CHO) — C2(CHOH) — C3(CHOH) — ¹³C4(CHOH) — C5(CHOH) — C6(CH2OH)`\n\n**Step 2: Understand the metabolic pathway in question.**\nThe question specifies the pathway as **glycolysis**. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. It is crucial to limit the analysis to only the reactions of glycolysis.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the fate of the carbon atoms during glycolysis.**\nThe overall net reaction of glycolysis is:\nGlucose (6 carbons) + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pᵢ → 2 Pyruvate (3 carbons each) + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n\n**Careful Point 1: Does glycolysis release CO₂?**\nLooking at the net reaction, the starting 6-carbon glucose molecule is converted into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n`6 carbons (in glucose) → 2 * 3 carbons (in pyruvate)`\nThere is no loss of carbon atoms during the entire process of glycolysis. No CO₂ is produced or released at any step of the glycolytic pathway. The pathway involves phosphorylation, isomerization, cleavage, and oxidation/phosphorylation, but no decarboxylation (removal of a carboxyl group as CO₂).\n\n**Careful Point 2: Distinguishing glycolysis from subsequent pathways.**\nCarbon dioxide is released in later stages of cellular respiration, but not during glycolysis itself.\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction):** This step converts each pyruvate molecule into acetyl-CoA and releases one molecule of CO₂.\n*   **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** This cycle takes the acetyl-CoA and releases two more molecules of CO₂ per acetyl-CoA.\n\nThe question strictly asks about **glycolysis**, not the entire process of glucose oxidation.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nSince no CO₂ is released during the process of glycolysis, it is impossible for any ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules to be released. The ¹³C labels from the original glucose molecule are conserved within the structures of the two pyruvate molecules formed at the end of glycolysis.\n\n*   The ¹³C at C1 of glucose ends up as the methyl carbon (C3) of one pyruvate molecule.\n*   The ¹³C at C4 of glucose ends up as the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\nHowever, neither of these carbons is released as CO₂ *during glycolysis*.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n1.  The process is glycolysis.\n2.  Glycolysis converts a 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvates.\n3.  No carbon atoms are lost in the form of CO₂ during this process.\n4.  Therefore, the number of CO₂ molecules (labeled or unlabeled) released is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
