    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Object and its Defining Properties:**\n    The question asks for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a **Calabi-Yau Link**. This link is described as the set of solutions to a polynomial equation within an ambient space defined by a set of weights. The term \"Calabi-Yau\" is a crucial technical property. For a hypersurface defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial in a weighted projective space, the Calabi-Yau condition implies a specific relationship between the polynomial's degree and the weights of the space.\n\n2.  **Extract the Data from the Problem:**\n    *   **Ambient Space:** The space is defined by 5 complex variables $(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)$.\n    *   **Weights:** The corresponding weights are given as $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n    *   **Polynomial:** The equation is given by $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Calabi-Yau Condition:**\n    A link associated with a hypersurface in a weighted projective space is called a \"Calabi-Yau Link\" if the degree of its defining quasi-homogeneous polynomial, `d`, is equal to the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$. This condition is equivalent to the associated Sasakian manifold being Sasaki-Einstein, which in turn means its basic first Chern class is zero.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Sum of the Weights:**\n    We sum the given weights:\n    $\\sum w_i = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 + w_5 = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Degree `d`:**\n    Based on the Calabi-Yau condition, the degree `d` of the defining polynomial must be equal to the sum of the weights.\n    Therefore, $d = \\sum w_i = 225$.\n\n6.  **Careful Point: Verify Consistency of the Provided Polynomial:**\n    Let's check if the given polynomial is indeed quasi-homogeneous with the required degree $d=225$. We calculate the weighted degree for each monomial:\n    *   `deg(z_1^8 z_3)` = 8 * $w_1$ + 1 * $w_3$ = 8 * 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225.\n    *   `deg(z_1^4 z_2^3 z_3)` = 4 * $w_1$ + 3 * $w_2$ + 1 * $w_3$ = 4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224.\n    *   `deg(z_1 z_2^7)` = 1 * $w_1$ + 7 * $w_2$ = 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = 225.\n    *   `deg(z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4 z_5)` = $w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5$ = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225.\n    *   `deg(z_2 z_3^4)` = 1 * $w_2$ + 4 * $w_3$ = 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = 225.\n    *   `deg(z_4^3 z_5)` = 3 * $w_4$ + 1 * $w_5$ = 3 * 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225.\n    *   `deg(z_5^3)` = 3 * $w_5$ = 3 * 75 = 225.\n\n    We observe that one monomial, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, has a degree of 224, while all others have the expected degree of 225. This indicates a typographical error in the provided polynomial. However, the problem statement's explicit use of the term \"Calabi-Yau Link\" is the defining characteristic we must follow. This term dictates that $d = \\sum w_i$, so we proceed with $d=225$. The specific form of the polynomial does not affect the calculation of this invariant, which depends only on the weights and the degree.\n\n7.  **State the Formula for the Crawley-Nordström Invariant:**\n    The Crawley-Nordström invariant, `cn(Y)`, for the link `Y` of a weighted homogeneous singularity is given by the formula:\n    $cn(Y) = \\frac{1}{2d} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} w_i - d \\right)$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Invariant:**\n    We substitute the values we have determined into the formula:\n    *   $d = 225$\n    *   $\\sum w_i = 225$\n\n    $cn = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 225} (225 - 225)$\n    $cn = \\frac{1}{450} (0)$\n    $cn = 0$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for any Calabi-Yau link is, by definition, zero. This is because the Calabi-Yau condition ($d = \\sum w_i$) causes the term $(\\sum w_i - d)$ in the invariant's formula to vanish.\n\n<<<0>>>"
