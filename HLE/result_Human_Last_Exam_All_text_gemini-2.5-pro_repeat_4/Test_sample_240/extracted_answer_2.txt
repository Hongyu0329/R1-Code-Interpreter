The primary reasons a functional MRI coil might not show resonance when probed are that it is either in a default, actively detuned "safe" state for protection during RF transmission, or it is an intentionally low-Q (heavily damped) design, common in phased arrays, where the resonance is too broad and shallow to be easily detected. Less common but possible reasons include placing the probe in a magnetic field null or a mismatch between the unbalanced probe and a balanced coil circuit.
