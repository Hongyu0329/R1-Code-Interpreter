    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Belonging to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\" of philosophy.\n    *   **Key Action:** Decomposing or analyzing a concept.\n    *   **Concept Analyzed:** \"Hallmark\" (a characteristic sign or feature).\n    *   **Components of the Decomposition:** \"Symptoms\" and \"Signals\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was a prominent school of logic and analytical philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (1918-1939).\n    *   Key figures include its founder Kazimierz Twardowski, and his students like Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   The school was known for its emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and the analysis of language.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction: \"Symptoms\" vs. \"Signals\"**\n    *   This distinction is a fundamental topic in semiotics (the theory of signs).\n    *   A **symptom** is generally understood as a *natural sign*. It is connected to what it signifies by a natural, often causal, relationship. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. The connection is not based on human convention.\n    *   A **signal** is generally understood as a *conventional* or *intentional sign*. It is created or used deliberately to communicate a message or to trigger a specific behavior. Its meaning is based on a rule, agreement, or code. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; a referee's whistle is a signal to stop play.\n\n4.  **Connect the Distinction to the Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   The task is to find which philosopher from this school made this specific analysis. The analysis of signs and meaning was a central concern for many members, but one philosopher is particularly known for this area.\n    *   While many in the school worked on logic, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** was a leading figure in epistemology, semantics, and the philosophy of language.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz developed a detailed theory of signs, which he called *oznaki* (a term that can be translated as \"signs,\" \"marks,\" or \"hallmarks\").\n    *   In his works, most notably in *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), he provides a classification of signs. His primary division is between **natural signs** (*znaki naturalne*) and **conventional signs** (*znaki konwencjonalne*).\n    *   He explicitly identifies **symptoms** (*symptomy*) as the primary example of natural signs, where the sign is causally linked to the object it signifies.\n    *   He then analyzes conventional signs, a major category of which are **signals** (*sygnały*), which are signs produced with the intention of influencing a recipient's behavior.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who systematically analyzed the broader notion of a sign/hallmark (*oznaka*) by distinguishing between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (which include signals). His work perfectly matches the description in the question.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   The term \"hallmark\" is a reasonable English translation for the Polish word *oznaka*, which Ajdukiewicz used as the general term for \"sign\" or \"mark.\"\n*   The distinction is fundamental to Ajdukiewicz's pragmatic philosophy of language and his theory of signs.\n*   While other philosophers (like Charles Sanders Peirce) also made similar distinctions, the question specifically asks for a member of the Lviv-Warsaw School. Within that group, Ajdukiewicz is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
