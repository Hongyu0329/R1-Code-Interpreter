    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\nSPDC is a quantum optical process rooted in nonlinear optics. In this process, a high-energy \"pump\" photon, passing through a suitable nonlinear optical medium, spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons, conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. This process must adhere to two fundamental conservation laws:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The energy of the pump photon must equal the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons (`ħω_p = ħω_s + ħω_i`).\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum (Phase-Matching):** The momentum of the pump photon must equal the sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons (`ħk_p = ħk_s + ħk_i`).\n\nCrucially, SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical effect**. The strength of this effect in a material is described by its second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Material Requirement for SPDC**\n\nThe fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit a second-order nonlinear optical effect (and thus have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ in the electric-dipole approximation) is that its crystal structure must **lack a center of inversion**. Materials with a center of inversion are called \"centrosymmetric,\" while those without are \"non-centrosymmetric.\" In a centrosymmetric material, the bulk χ⁽²⁾ is identically zero due to symmetry constraints. Therefore, the primary question to answer is: \"Are free-standing boron nanosheets centrosymmetric?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Properties of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are 2D allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single, stable honeycomb structure, borophene is highly polymorphic, meaning it can exist in many different atomic arrangements.\n*   **Synthesis and Common Phases:** The most common and stable phases of borophene synthesized experimentally (typically on a silver substrate) are the **β₁₂** and **χ₃** phases.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis of Common Phases:**\n    *   The β₁₂ phase has a rectangular unit cell and belongs to the space group *Pmmn*.\n    *   The χ₃ phase also has a rectangular unit cell and belongs to the space group *Cmcm*.\n    *   Both of these space groups (*Pmmn* and *Cmcm*) describe **centrosymmetric** crystal structures. They possess a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Physics of SPDC with the Properties of Borophene**\n\nSince the common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic bulk (or more accurately, in-plane) χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Based on this primary consideration, an ideal, perfect, free-standing boron nanosheet would **not** be expected to exhibit SPDC through the dominant electric dipole mechanism.\n\n### List of Careful Points and Nuances\n\n1.  **Centrosymmetry is Key:** The central point is the symmetry of the material. As the common phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, they fail the most fundamental requirement for a strong χ⁽²⁾ response.\n\n2.  **The \"Surface\" of a 2D Material:** For any material, inversion symmetry is broken at its surface. For an atomically thin 2D material, the entire sheet can be considered a \"surface.\" This can lead to a non-zero *surface* χ⁽²⁾. However, for the centrosymmetric phases of borophene, the in-plane symmetry still strongly suppresses the nonlinear response, making it significantly weaker than in materials that are non-centrosymmetric in their bulk form (like hexagonal boron nitride or MoS₂).\n\n3.  **Imperfections:** Real-world nanosheets are not perfect. Defects, edges, wrinkles, or strain can locally break the inversion symmetry of the lattice. These imperfections could potentially act as sites for a weak second-order nonlinear response. However, this response would be weak, non-uniform, and not characteristic of the material itself, leading to extremely inefficient SPDC, if any.\n\n4.  **Metallic Nature:** Most phases of borophene are predicted and observed to be **metallic**. This presents another significant obstacle.\n    *   **High Optical Absorption:** Metals strongly absorb light over a broad spectrum. This means the incident pump photons, as well as any generated signal/idler photons, would be quickly absorbed. High linear absorption is detrimental to nonlinear processes like SPDC, which require a significant interaction length.\n    *   **Screening Effect:** The free electrons in a metal can screen the incident electromagnetic field of the light, which dampens the nonlinear polarization and further suppresses nonlinear optical effects.\n\n5.  **Higher-Order Effects:** In centrosymmetric materials, weak second-order effects can sometimes arise from higher-order multipole contributions (like electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole interactions). However, these effects are typically several orders of magnitude weaker than the electric dipole contributions found in non-centrosymmetric materials and are generally negligible for practical applications like SPDC.\n\n### Final Conclusion with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Requirement Check:** SPDC requires a non-centrosymmetric material with a significant χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  **Borophene Symmetry Check:** The common, stable phases of borophene (β₁₂ and χ₃) are centrosymmetric.\n3.  **Primary Conclusion:** Due to its centrosymmetry, ideal borophene has a χ⁽²⁾ of zero and should not exhibit SPDC.\n4.  **Secondary Obstacle Check:** Borophene is metallic, leading to high absorption and screening, which would severely inhibit any nonlinear optical process, even if symmetry allowed for it.\n5.  **Overall Assessment:** The combination of an intrinsically centrosymmetric crystal structure and a metallic nature makes free-standing boron nanosheets extremely poor candidates for exhibiting spontaneous parametric downconversion. Any potential signal arising from defects or surface effects would be exceptionally weak and inefficient.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that they would not be expected to exhibit this phenomenon in any significant way.\n\n<<<No>>>"
