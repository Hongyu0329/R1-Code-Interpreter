    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question.**\nThe question asks to determine the part of speech of the first word in the sentence: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure.**\nThe sentence is \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n- The first word is \"Fat\".\n- The second word is \"people\".\n- The word \"Fat\" is placed directly before the word \"people\".\n\n**Step 3: Determine the part of speech of the surrounding words.**\n- The word \"people\" is a noun. It refers to a group of persons.\n- The word \"Fat\" is used to describe or modify the noun \"people\". It specifies a characteristic of the people being discussed.\n\n**Step 4: Define the relevant parts of speech.**\n- **Adjective:** A word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun (e.g., \"a *red* car,\" \"*tall* people\").\n- **Noun:** A word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea (e.g., \"dog,\" \"city,\" \"happiness\"). \"Fat\" can be a noun, as in \"cooking with fat.\"\n- **Verb:** A word that expresses action or a state of being (e.g., \"run,\" \"is\"). \"Fat\" is not typically a verb.\n- **Adverb:** A word that modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb (e.g., \"run *quickly*,\" \"*very* tall\").\n- **Conjunction:** A word used to connect clauses or sentences or to coordinate words in the same clause (e.g., \"and,\" \"but,\" \"if\").\n\n**Step 5: Apply the definitions to the word \"Fat\" in the given sentence.**\n- In the phrase \"Fat people,\" the word \"Fat\" is providing more information about the noun \"people.\" It is describing them.\n- This function aligns perfectly with the definition of an adjective.\n- Although the rest of the sentence (\"eat accumulates\") is grammatically unusual, it does not change the relationship between \"Fat\" and \"people\". The word \"Fat\" is still functioning as a modifier for the noun \"people\".\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the answer choices.**\n- A. Verb: \"Fat\" is not expressing an action here.\n- B. Noun: \"Fat\" is not acting as a person, place, or thing; it is describing one.\n- C. Adjective: \"Fat\" is describing the noun \"people\". This is the correct choice.\n- D. Adverb: \"Fat\" is not modifying a verb, adjective, or another adverb.\n- E. Conjunction: \"Fat\" is not connecting words or clauses.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" in the sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" functions as an adjective because it modifies the noun \"people\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
