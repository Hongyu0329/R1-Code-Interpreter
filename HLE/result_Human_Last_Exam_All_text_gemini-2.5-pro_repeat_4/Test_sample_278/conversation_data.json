    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve.**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nfor $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nThe parameter `b` has a piecewise definition:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $b=1$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$.\n\nLet's analyze these two parts of the curve separately to understand the overall shape of the figure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first part of the curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$).**\nIn this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\n\n*   These are the standard parametric equations for a circle. We can verify this by noting that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n*   As `t` varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n    *   When $t=0$, $(x,y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n    *   When $t=\\pi/2$, $(x,y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n    *   When $t=\\pi$, $(x,y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   Since $\\sin t \\ge 0$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the y-values are always non-negative. This part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   The range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$.\n*   The range of y-values is $[0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second part of the curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$).**\nIn this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5 \\sin t$\n\n*   These equations describe an ellipse. We can see this by rearranging: $x^2 = \\cos^2 t$ and $(y/5)^2 = \\sin^2 t$. Adding these gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n*   As `t` varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n    *   As $t \\to \\pi^+$, $(x,y) \\to (\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$. This point connects smoothly with the end of the first part.\n    *   When $t=3\\pi/2$, $(x,y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n    *   As $t \\to 2\\pi^-$, $(x,y) \\to (\\cos(2\\pi), 5\\sin(2\\pi)) = (1, 0)$. This point connects smoothly with the start of the first part.\n*   Since $\\sin t \\le 0$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the y-values are always non-positive. This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\n*   The range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$.\n*   The range of y-values is $[-5, 0]$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the bounding box of the entire figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the entire curve. This defines a bounding rectangle.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:** For both parts of the curve, the x-values are given by $x = \\cos t$. The range of $\\cos t$ over $[0, 2\\pi]$ is $[-1, 1]$. So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$.\n*   **Y-coordinates:**\n    *   From the first part (the semi-circle), the y-values range from 0 to 1. The maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   From the second part (the semi-ellipse), the y-values range from -5 to 0. The minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n*   Combining both parts, the total range for y is $[-5, 1]$.\n\nThe width of the bounding rectangle is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe height of the bounding rectangle is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the smallest circumscribing square and its area.**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that contains this figure must have a side length, `s`, that is greater than or equal to both the width and the height of the bounding rectangle.\n$s \\ge W = 2$\n$s \\ge H = 6$\n\nTo satisfy both conditions, the side length of the square must be at least the maximum of the two dimensions.\n$s_{min} = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest square that can outcircle (circumscribe) the figure has a side length of 6.\n\nThe area of this square is:\nArea = $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$."
