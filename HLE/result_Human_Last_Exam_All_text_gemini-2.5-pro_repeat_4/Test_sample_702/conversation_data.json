    "Answering this question requires analyzing the connectivity of a specific map in algebraic topology, which connects concepts like loop spaces, smash products, and their homotopy groups.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map\n\n*   **Domain:** $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^k$ is the loop space of the $k$-sphere.\n    *   $\\wedge$ is the smash product.\n    *   $\\Sigma$ is the reduced suspension.\n*   **Codomain:** $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\cong S^{10}$, the codomain is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   **The Map:** $f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" points to a standard construction in homotopy theory, often denoted by $\\lambda$ or related to the dual EHP sequence or the James-Hopf invariant. We don't need the explicit construction, but we need to know its properties, which are well-studied.\n\n### Step 2: Define connectivity\n\nA map $f: A \\to B$ is said to be **$k$-connected** if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A, a_0) \\to \\pi_i(B, b_0)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism (surjection) for $i = k$. This is equivalent to saying that the homotopy fiber of $f$ is $(k-1)$-connected.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the homotopy groups of the domain and codomain\n\nTo determine the connectivity of $f$, we need to compare the low-dimensional homotopy groups of the domain $A$ and the codomain $B$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the factors:**\n    *   The space $\\Omega S^k$ is $(k-2)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of the smash product:**\n    *   If $X$ is $c_1$-connected and $Y$ is $c_2$-connected, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(c_1 + c_2 + 1)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2 + 4 + 1) = 7$-connected.\n*   **Connectivity of the domain:**\n    *   The suspension $\\Sigma X$ of a $c$-connected space $X$ is $(c+1)$-connected.\n    *   The domain $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected. This means $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n*   **Connectivity of the codomain:**\n    *   The codomain $B = \\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$-connected. This means $\\pi_i(B) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n\nSince both spaces are 8-connected, the map $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ is an isomorphism ($0 \\to 0$) for $i < 9$. Therefore, the connectivity of $f$ is at least 9.\n\n### Step 4: Compare homotopy groups in higher dimensions\n\nWe need to check the behavior of $f_*$ on $\\pi_i$ for $i \\ge 9$. This requires knowing the homotopy groups and properties of the map $f_*$.\n\n*   **$\\pi_9(f)$:**\n    *   $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since $\\Omega S^k$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{k-1}$ in a range of dimensions, we can approximate $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\approx \\pi_8(S^3 \\wedge S^5) = \\pi_8(S^8) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is a homomorphism $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. The map $f$ is a fundamental map in this context, and it is known to induce an isomorphism of degree $\\pm 1$ on the first non-trivial homotopy group. So, $\\pi_9(f)$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   Since $\\pi_9(f)$ is an isomorphism, the connectivity is at least 10.\n\n*   **$\\pi_{10}(f)$:**\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(A) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\approx \\pi_9(S^8) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. (The generator is related to the Hopf map $\\eta_8$).\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. (The generator is related to the Hopf map $\\eta_{10}$).\n    *   The map $f_*: \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B)$ is a homomorphism $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This map is known to be an isomorphism, sending the generator to the generator.\n    *   Since $\\pi_{10}(f)$ is an isomorphism, the connectivity is at least 11.\n\n*   **$\\pi_{11}(f)$:**\n    *   $\\pi_{11}(A) = \\pi_{11}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\approx \\pi_{10}(S^8) = \\mathbb{Z}_{24}$.\n    *   $\\pi_{11}(B) = \\pi_{11}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{12}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The map $f_*: \\pi_{11}(A) \\to \\pi_{11}(B)$ is a homomorphism $\\mathbb{Z}_{24} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This map is known to be the natural projection, which is surjective (an epimorphism) but not injective.\n    *   Since $\\pi_{11}(f)$ is an epimorphism, the definition of connectivity is satisfied for $k=11$.\n\n*   **$\\pi_{12}(f)$:**\n    *   For the connectivity to be 12, $\\pi_{11}(f)$ would need to be an isomorphism. As we have just seen, it is not.\n    *   Therefore, the connectivity cannot be 12.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe map $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i<11$ and an epimorphism for $i=11$. Based on the definition of connectivity, the connectivity of the map is 11. This result is consistent with known theorems in unstable homotopy theory regarding this specific map."
