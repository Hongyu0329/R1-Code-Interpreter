    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific ship with several qualifying criteria:\n*   **Nationality:** French.\n*   **Action:** Sunk.\n*   **Perpetrator:** A German U-boat.\n*   **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This period covers roughly September 1939 to June 21, 1940.\n*   **Measurement:** The \"largest\" ship determined by its displacement.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The distinction between warships and merchant ships must be considered, as both are \"French ships\".\n*   The timeframe is critical. Events after the armistice, such as the attack on Mers-el-KÃ©bir, are not relevant.\n*   The metric is \"displacement\" (the weight of the ship), not Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of volume. While GRT is often used as a proxy for size, displacement is the specific metric requested. For different types of ships (e.g., tanker vs. passenger liner), the ratio of displacement to GRT can vary significantly.\n\n**Step 2: Research and Initial Filtering**\nFirst, we must determine if any major French warships were sunk by U-boats in this period.\n*   The French Navy (Marine Nationale) did not lose any of its capital ships (battleships or heavy cruisers) to U-boat attacks before the armistice.\n*   The largest French warship sunk by a U-boat in this period was the submarine *Doris* (Q135), sunk on May 9, 1940, by *U-9*. Its surfaced displacement was only 552 tons.\n*   Therefore, the answer must be a merchant vessel, as their tonnage is generally much higher than that of a submarine.\n\n**Step 3: Identify and Compare Merchant Ship Candidates**\nNext, we search for large French merchant ships sunk by U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940. A list of notable sinkings, ranked by tonnage, is required. The most common metric available is Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n\n*   **Candidate 1:** The passenger/cargo ship **Bretagne**.\n    *   Sunk: 14 October 1939 by *U-45*.\n    *   Size: 10,108 GRT.\n*   **Candidate 2:** The passenger liner **Brazza**.\n    *   Sunk: 28 May 1940 by *U-37*.\n    *   Size: 10,387 GRT.\n*   **Candidate 3:** The tanker **Sheherazade**.\n    *   Sunk: 1 June 1940 by *U-46*.\n    *   Size: 13,467 GRT.\n\n**Step 4: Final Analysis Based on Displacement**\nNow we compare these candidates using the specific metric of \"displacement\".\n1.  Based on GRT (volume), the *Sheherazade* is clearly the largest of the three.\n2.  We must now consider displacement (weight). A ship's displacement consists of its own weight (lightship tonnage) plus the weight of its cargo, fuel, and supplies (deadweight tonnage).\n    *   For passenger liners like the *Bretagne* and *Brazza*, their fully loaded displacement is often relatively close to their GRT.\n    *   For a tanker like the *Sheherazade*, its primary purpose is to carry dense liquid cargo (oil). Its deadweight tonnage (cargo capacity) is very high. The *Sheherazade* had a deadweight capacity of around 20,100 tons. When fully loaded, its total displacement would be its lightship weight plus this cargo, resulting in a displacement significantly higher than its 13,467 GRT figure, estimated to be over 26,000 tons.\n3.  This confirms that the *Sheherazade* was not only the largest by internal volume (GRT) but also, by a very wide margin, the largest by weight (displacement).\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll criteria from the question are met by this ship:\n*   **Ship:** *Sheherazade*\n*   **Nationality:** French\n*   **Action & Perpetrator:** Sunk by U-boat (*U-46*)\n*   **Timeframe:** Sunk on June 1, 1940, before the June 22 armistice.\n*   **Size:** Largest by displacement (and also by GRT) among all French ships sunk by U-boats in the specified period.\n\n<<<Sheherazade>>>"
