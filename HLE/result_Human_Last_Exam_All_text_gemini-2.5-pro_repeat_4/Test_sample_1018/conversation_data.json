    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understanding Simplicial Volume and Key Formulas**\n\nThe simplicial volume of a closed, oriented $n$-manifold $M$, denoted by $\\|M\\|$, is a topological invariant that measures the \"size\" of the manifold in a homological sense. To solve this problem, we need two fundamental results from the theory of simplicial volumes, primarily due to Gromov.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Simplicial Volume of Hyperbolic Surfaces**\n    For an oriented, closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$, its simplicial volume depends on the genus:\n    *   If $g=0$ ($\\Sigma_0 \\cong S^2$) or $g=1$ ($\\Sigma_1 \\cong T^2$), the fundamental group is amenable, which implies $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 0$.\n    *   If $g \\ge 2$, the surface $\\Sigma_g$ admits a complete hyperbolic metric (a metric of constant curvature -1). For such surfaces, the simplicial volume is non-zero and can be calculated using its Euler characteristic, $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$. The formula is:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = -2\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$\n    The Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$ is given by $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$. Substituting this in, we get:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = -2(2-2g) = 4g - 4 = 4(g-1)$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Product Formula**\n    For a product of two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ (of dimension $m$) and $N$ (of dimension $n$), the simplicial volume of the product manifold $M \\times N$ is given by:\n    $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$\n    This formula holds if $\\|M\\| \\neq 0$ and $\\|N\\| \\neq 0$. If either factor has zero simplicial volume, the product's simplicial volume is also zero.\n\n**2. Calculating the Simplicial Volume of the Factor Manifolds**\n\nThe problem asks for the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. Let's first compute the simplicial volume of each factor.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{31}$:**\n    The genus is $g=31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, this is a hyperbolic surface.\n    Using the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{17}$:**\n    The genus is $g=17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, this is also a hyperbolic surface.\n    Using the same formula:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\n**3. Applying the Product Formula**\n\nNow we can compute the simplicial volume of the product manifold $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n*   Let $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   The dimension of $M$ is $m=2$.\n*   The dimension of $N$ is $n=2$.\n*   We have $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 120$ and $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 64$. Since neither is zero, we can apply the product formula.\n\nThe formula is $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$.\nSubstituting our values:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{2+2}{2} \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Binomial Coefficient Calculation**\n    First, we calculate the binomial coefficient:\n    $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Final Arithmetic**\n    Now, we perform the multiplication:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$\n    $= 720 \\times 64$\n    $= 46080$.\n\nThus, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 46080.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{46080}$.\n<<<46080>>>"
