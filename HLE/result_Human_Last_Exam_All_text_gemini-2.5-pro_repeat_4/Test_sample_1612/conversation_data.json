    "To accurately determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we must follow a clear, step-by-step process.\n\n### Step 1: Define \"Triple Crown\"\nIn Major League Baseball, there are two types of Triple Crowns: one for batting and one for pitching.\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player wins the batting Triple Crown by leading their league (American League or National League) in three specific categories in a single season:\n    1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n    2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n    3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher wins the pitching Triple Crown by leading their league in three key categories in a single season:\n    1.  **Wins (W)**\n    2.  **Strikeouts (SO)**\n    3.  **Earned Run Average (ERA)**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Ambiguity of the Question\nThe question \"How many triple crowns winners are there\" can be interpreted in a few ways:\n*   Is it asking for batting winners, pitching winners, or both?\n*   Is it asking for the number of unique players who have won (e.g., Ted Williams counts as one winner), or the number of times it has been won (e.g., Ted Williams' two wins count as two)?\n\n**Careful Point:** In common baseball parlance, \"The Triple Crown\" almost always refers to the **batting Triple Crown**, as it is a rarer and more celebrated achievement. The term \"winner\" typically refers to a unique individual. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is to count the **number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.**\n\n### Step 3: List and Count the Batting Triple Crown Winners\nWe will list all the players who have won the batting Triple Crown in either the National League (NL), American League (AL), or the American Association (AA), which is recognized as a major league for the period it existed.\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878, NL)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887, AA)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894, NL)\n4.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901, AL)\n5.  **Ty Cobb** (1909, AL)\n6.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912, NL)\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 & 1925, NL)\n8.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, AL)\n9.  **Chuck Klein** (1933, NL)\n10. **Lou Gehrig** (1934, AL)\n11. **Joe Medwick** (1937, NL)\n12. **Ted Williams** (1942 & 1947, AL)\n13. **Mickey Mantle** (1956, AL)\n14. **Frank Robinson** (1966, AL)\n15. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, AL)\n16. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, AL)\n\n### Step 4: Final Count and Conclusion\nNow we count the number of unique players from the list above.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won the Triple Crown twice. When counting unique \"winners,\" each is only counted once.\n*   **Careful Point:** In 1933, there were two different winners: Jimmie Foxx in the AL and Chuck Klein in the NL. Both are counted as unique winners.\n\nCounting the distinct names on the list gives us a total of **16** unique players.\n\n*For completeness:*\n*   The batting Triple Crown has been won a total of **18** times.\n*   The pitching Triple Crown has been won by **27** unique players a total of **39** times.\n\nBased on the most common interpretation of the question, the final answer is the number of unique batting Triple Crown winners.\n\n<<<16>>>"
