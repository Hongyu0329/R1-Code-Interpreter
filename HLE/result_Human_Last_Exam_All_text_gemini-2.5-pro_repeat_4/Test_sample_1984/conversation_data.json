    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nAn equilibrium point of the differential equation $x'(t) = f(x)$ is a value of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. These are the constant solutions to the differential equation.\nWe need to solve the equation:\n$$ -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out a $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term inside the parentheses is a perfect square trinomial: $x^{2} - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n1.  $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n2.  $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can analyze the sign of the function $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$ in the neighborhood of $x^*$. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is:\n*   **Stable** if solutions starting near $x^*$ approach $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This happens if $f(x) > 0$ for $x < x^*$ and $f(x) < 0$ for $x > x^*$ (in the immediate neighborhood).\n*   **Unstable** if solutions starting near $x^*$ move away from $x^*$. This happens if $f(x) < 0$ for $x < x^*$ and $f(x) > 0$ for $x > x^*$.\n*   **Semi-stable** if solutions on one side of $x^*$ approach it, while solutions on the other side move away from it.\n\nLet's analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$. The term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative.\n\n*   **Analysis for x = 0:**\n    *   If $x$ is slightly less than 0 (e.g., $x = -0.1$), then $-x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = (-x)(x-1)^2 = (\\text{pos})(\\text{pos}) > 0$. This means $x(t)$ increases towards 0.\n    *   If $x$ is slightly greater than 0 (e.g., $x = 0.1$), then $-x$ is negative and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = (-x)(x-1)^2 = (\\text{neg})(\\text{pos}) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ decreases towards 0.\n    Since solutions on both sides of $x=0$ move towards $x=0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **Analysis for x = 1:**\n    *   If $x$ is slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), then $-x$ is negative and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = (-x)(x-1)^2 = (\\text{neg})(\\text{pos}) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from 1.\n    *   If $x$ is slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), then $-x$ is negative and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = (-x)(x-1)^2 = (\\text{neg})(\\text{pos}) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards 1.\n    Since solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as **semi-stable**.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of stable equilibrium points**\n\nBased on the stability analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expression**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression, we get:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
