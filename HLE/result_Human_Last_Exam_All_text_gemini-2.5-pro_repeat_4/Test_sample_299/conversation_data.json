    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the fundamental properties of the function.**\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$.\n    Since the exponential function $y=e^x$ is strictly increasing, it is injective. Thus, $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:**\n    A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is injective must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Composition and Monotonicity:**\n    The function $g(x) = e^x$ is strictly increasing.\n    If $f$ is strictly increasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x))=e^x$.\n    If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing (the composition of two decreasing functions is increasing). This is also consistent with $f(f(x))=e^x$.\n    So, we must analyze both cases.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case where $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n\n1.  A strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. This means its range is $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n2.  Since the range is $\\mathbb{R}$, there must exist a unique real number $c$ such that $f(c) = 0$.\n3.  Using the original equation for $x=c$: $f(f(c)) = e^c \\implies f(0) = e^c$.\n4.  From the original equation, we can deduce a commutation property.\n    $f(f(f(x))) = f(e^x)$\n    $f(f(f(x))) = e^{f(x)}$\n    Therefore, $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n5.  Let's use this property for $x=c$: $f(e^c) = e^{f(c)} = e^0 = 1$.\n6.  Now we have three values: $f(c)=0$, $f(0)=e^c$, and $f(e^c)=1$.\n7.  Let's check for consistency with the fact that $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n    *   If $c = 0$, then $f(0)=0$. The original equation gives $f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0$. But $f(f(0))=e^0=1$. This leads to the contradiction $0=1$. So $c \\ne 0$.\n    *   If $c < 0$, then since $f$ is strictly decreasing, $c<0 \\implies f(c) > f(0)$. Substituting the values, we get $0 > e^c$. This is a contradiction, as $e^c > 0$ for all real $c$.\n    *   If $c > 0$, we have the ordered points $0 < c$. For any real $c$, $e^c > c$. Also, for $c>0$, $e^c > 1$. So we have the ordered set of points $0 < c < e^c$. Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, we must have $f(0) > f(c) > f(e^c)$. Substituting the values, we get $e^c > 0 > 1$. While $e^c>0$ is true, the inequality $0>1$ is a clear contradiction.\n\nSince all possible cases for a strictly decreasing function lead to a contradiction, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions satisfying the given equation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case where $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n\n1.  Let's analyze the behavior of $f$ at infinity.\n    *   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} e^x = \\infty$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} e^x = 0$. Let $a = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$. This implies $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = 0$.\n2.  The limit $a$ must be a finite real number. If $a = -\\infty$, then $f$ would be a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. But $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = 0$ would contradict the fact that for an increasing bijection, this limit must be $-\\infty$.\n3.  Since $f$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $f(a) = \\lim_{y \\to a} f(y) = 0$.\n4.  The range of the strictly increasing function $f$ is $(\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x), \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)) = (a, \\infty)$.\n5.  This means that for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f(x) \\in (a, \\infty)$, so $f(x) > a$.\n6.  Applying this to $x=a$, we get $f(a) > a$. Since $f(a)=0$, this implies $0 > a$, so $a$ must be a negative number.\n7.  We can now establish a framework for constructing such functions $f$. A function $f$ in this class is determined by:\n    a) A choice of a real number $a < 0$.\n    b) A choice of a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi: [a, 0] \\to [f(a), f(0)]$.\n8.  Let's find $f(0)$. Using the original equation at $x=a$: $f(f(a)) = e^a \\implies f(0) = e^a$.\n9.  So, for any $a<0$, we must choose a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ that maps the interval $[a, 0]$ to the interval $[0, e^a]$, with the boundary conditions $\\phi(a)=0$ and $\\phi(0)=e^a$.\n10. Once $a$ and $\\phi$ are chosen, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   For $x \\in [a, 0]$, we define $f(x) = \\phi(x)$.\n    *   For $x \\in (-\\infty, a)$, we must have $f(f(x)) = e^x$. The range of $f$ on this interval is $(a, 0)$. On $(a, 0)$, $f$ is defined as $\\phi$. So $\\phi(f(x)) = e^x$, which implies $f(x) = \\phi^{-1}(e^x)$.\n    *   For $x > 0$, we can use the commutation property $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ to define $f$ recursively. Any $x>0$ can be written as $x = \\exp(\\ln(x))$. So $f(x) = \\exp(f(\\ln x))$. By repeatedly taking logarithms, any positive $x$ can be related to a value in $(-\\infty, 0]$, where $f$ has already been defined.\n11. This construction yields a valid, continuous, strictly increasing function $f$ satisfying $f(f(x))=e^x$ for any valid choice of $a$ and $\\phi$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the cardinality of the set of solutions.**\n\n1.  The set of solutions corresponds to the set of possible choices for $(a, \\phi)$.\n2.  The choice for $a$: $a$ can be any negative real number. The set of negative real numbers has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., of $\\mathbb{R}$).\n3.  The choice for $\\phi$: For any fixed $a<0$, we need to choose a continuous, strictly increasing function from $[a,0]$ to $[0, e^a]$.\n    *   There is at least one such function (e.g., the straight line connecting $(a,0)$ and $(0, e^a)$).\n    *   In fact, there is a continuum of choices. We can start with the linear function and add a small \"bump\" function that is zero at the endpoints. The set of such bump functions has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, for each choice of $a$, there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $\\phi$.\n4.  The total number of solutions is the number of pairs $(a, \\phi)$. This is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n5.  The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. The set of solutions is a subset of this set, so its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n6.  Since we have shown that there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions, the cardinality of the set of solutions must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum (the same as the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$).\n\n<<<c>>>"
