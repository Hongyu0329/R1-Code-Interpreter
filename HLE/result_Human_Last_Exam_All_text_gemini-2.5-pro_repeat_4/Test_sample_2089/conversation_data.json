    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Film Type:** It must be an Oscar-nominated film. This is a critical filter.\n    *   **Character Action:** A character says the specific words \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **Setting of Action:** This happens while the character is boarding a bus.\n    *   **Consequence:** This action seals the character's fate, implying it leads directly to their capture or death.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Films and Scenes:**\n    The combination of these specific elements (Oscar nomination, bus, \"Thank you,\" sealed fate) points strongly to one particular movie. We will analyze the scene in detail.\n\n3.  **Identify the Film, Character, and Context:**\n    *   **Film:** *No Country for Old Men* (2007).\n    *   **Oscar Status:** The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four, including Best Picture, making it a highly prominent Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   **Character:** Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin).\n    *   **Context:** Moss is on the run after taking a briefcase containing two million dollars from the site of a drug deal gone bad. He is being relentlessly pursued by the hitman Anton Chigurh and a group of Mexican cartel members.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specific Scene:**\n    *   Moss is at a bus depot, attempting to flee to El Paso, Texas.\n    *   To avoid looking suspicious with an open container of beer, he gives the can to another man waiting for a bus.\n    *   This seemingly minor act of caution backfires. The Mexican cartel members arrive and ask that man if he has seen Moss. The man points Moss out just as he is walking toward his bus.\n    *   Moss, oblivious to being identified, proceeds to get on the bus. As the driver helps him or tells him to watch his step, Moss politely says, **\"Thank you.\"**\n\n5.  **Connect the Action to the Consequence (\"Sealing His Fate\"):**\n    *   The act of getting on that bus is what seals Llewelyn's fate. The cartel members now know exactly where he is going.\n    *   They follow the bus to El Paso, track him to his motel, and kill him there off-screen.\n    *   While the phrase \"Thank you\" itself is not what gives him away (the man with the beer does that), it is spoken during the pivotal, fateful moment of boarding the bus. The entire sequence—being identified and then getting on the bus—is the point of no return for him. The simple, polite phrase stands in stark, ironic contrast to the violent end that this action precipitates.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Causality:** The question states the character seals his fate *by saying* \"Thank you.\" In this case, the phrase is part of the larger, fatal action of boarding the bus. The entire sequence is inextricably linked.\n*   **Oscar Nomination:** Verifying that *No Country for Old Men* won the Oscar for Best Picture confirms it meets the primary criterion of the question.\n*   **Excluding Other Films:** Other famous scenes in Oscar-nominated films might come to mind but do not fit all the criteria. For instance, a famous death scene in *The Departed* takes place in an elevator, not on a bus. The specificity of the user's question makes *No Country for Old Men* the correct answer.\n\n<<<No Country for Old Men>>>"
