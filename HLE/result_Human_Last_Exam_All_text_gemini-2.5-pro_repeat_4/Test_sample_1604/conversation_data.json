    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Artist and Scope of Work:**\n    The artist is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933), a famous British painter known for her military scenes. The task is to survey her paintings and identify the historical battles they represent.\n\n2.  **List Key Paintings and the Battles Depicted:**\n    We will create a list of Lady Butler's notable battle paintings and identify the specific historical event each one portrays. A careful point here is to distinguish between the date the painting was created and the date of the event it depicts. The question concerns the date of the battle itself.\n\n    *   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (Painted 1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n    *   ***Scotland Forever!*** (Painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, which occurred on **June 18, 1815**.\n    *   ***The Roll Call*** (Painted 1874): Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle was fought on **November 5, 1854**.\n    *   ***Balaclava*** (Painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, also during the Crimean War, on **October 25, 1854**.\n    *   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (Painted 1880): Depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War, which took place on **January 22–23, 1879**.\n    *   ***Floreat Etona!*** (Painted 1898): Depicts an incident during the Battle of Laing's Nek in the First Boer War on **January 28, 1881**.\n    *   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (Painted 1885): Depicts the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War on **September 13, 1882**.\n    *   ***The Camel Corps*** (Painted c. 1890s): Depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition during the Mahdist War. A key battle of this campaign was the Battle of Abu Klea on **January 17, 1885**.\n    *   ***The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916*** (Painted 1917): This painting depicts a specific cavalry charge during the Senussi Campaign of World War I. The battle, known as the Action at Agagia, took place on **February 26, 1916**.\n\n3.  **Compare the Historical Dates of the Battles:**\n    Now, let's list the years of the events to find the latest one:\n    *   Battle of Quatre Bras: 1815\n    *   Battle of Waterloo: 1815\n    *   Battle of Inkerman / Balaclava: 1854\n    *   Battle of Rorke's Drift: 1879\n    *   Battle of Laing's Nek: 1881\n    *   Battle of Tel El Kebir: 1882\n    *   Battle of Abu Klea: 1885\n    *   Action at Agagia: **1916**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    By comparing the dates of the historical events depicted in her paintings, the Action at Agagia in 1916 is clearly the latest. This World War I battle occurred significantly later than the Victorian-era conflicts for which Lady Butler is most famous.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** It is crucial not to confuse the date a work was painted with the historical date of the event. For example, *Scotland Forever!* was painted in 1881, but the Battle of Waterloo it depicts was in 1815.\n*   **Comprehensive Search:** A less famous painting might hold the answer. In this case, *The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia* is less iconic than *The Roll Call* or *Scotland Forever!*, but it portrays the latest event.\n*   **Specificity of the Title:** The title of the painting, *The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916*, explicitly provides the date of the event, making it a key piece of evidence.\n\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Action at Agagia.\n\n<<<The Action at Agagia>>>"
