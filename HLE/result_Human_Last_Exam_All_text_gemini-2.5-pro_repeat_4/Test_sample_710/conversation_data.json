    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number N.\n\n**Step 1: Define the set of numbers**\n\nThe numbers are of the form $a_n = 2n^2+3n+1$ for positive integers $n \\ge 1$.\nLet's factor the expression: $a_n = (2n+1)(n+1)$.\nLet's list the first few elements of this set, which we'll call $S$:\n$a_1 = (2(1)+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6$\n$a_2 = (2(2)+1)(2+1) = 5 \\times 3 = 15$\n$a_3 = (2(3)+1)(3+1) = 7 \\times 4 = 28$\n$a_4 = (2(4)+1)(4+1) = 9 \\times 5 = 45$\n$a_5 = (2(5)+1)(5+1) = 11 \\times 6 = 66$\n$a_6 = (2(6)+1)(6+1) = 13 \\times 7 = 91$\n$a_7 = (2(7)+1)(7+1) = 15 \\times 8 = 120$\n$a_8 = (2(8)+1)(8+1) = 17 \\times 9 = 153$\nThe set is $S = \\{6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest integer $N$ such that any integer $M \\ge N$ can be written as a sum of one or more *distinct* elements from the set $S$. This is equivalent to finding the largest integer that *cannot* be represented as such a sum, let's call it $g$. Then, $N = g+1$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of the set using modular arithmetic**\n\nA powerful way to check if all large numbers can be formed is to see if all possible remainders modulo some integer can be generated. The smallest element is 6, so let's analyze the elements of $S$ modulo 6.\n$a_n = 2n^2+3n+1 \\pmod{6}$\n$a_1 = 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$\n$a_2 = 15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$\n$a_3 = 28 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}$\n$a_4 = 45 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$\n$a_5 = 66 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$\n$a_6 = 91 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$\n$a_7 = 120 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$\n$a_8 = 153 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$\n\nThe sequence of residues modulo 6 is periodic. Let's check the period.\n$a_{n+k} - a_n = (2(n+k)^2+3(n+k)+1) - (2n^2+3n+1) = 4nk + 2k^2 + 3k$.\nFor this difference to be $0 \\pmod 6$, we need $4nk + 2k^2 + 3k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$.\nIf $k=6$, the difference is $24n + 72 + 18 = 24n + 90$, which is always divisible by 6. So the sequence of residues is periodic with period 6.\nThe set of residues of the elements of $S$ is $\\{0, 1, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the residues of the sums**\n\nLet $C(S)$ be the set of all possible sums of distinct elements of $S$.\nTo form a sum with a certain residue modulo 6, we must sum the residues of the chosen elements.\nThe available residues from $S$ are $R = \\{0, 1, 3, 4\\}$.\nCan we form all residues from 0 to 5 by summing distinct elements from $R$?\n- 0 is available.\n- 1 is available (from $a_6, a_{12}, \\dots$).\n- 3 is available (from $a_2, a_4, \\dots$).\n- 4 is available (from $a_3, a_9, \\dots$).\n- To get 2: We can try summing elements. $1+...$ no, $3+...$ no, $4+...$ no. Let's try more sums. $1+3+4 = 8 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$. So we need to use elements with residues 1, 3, and 4.\n- To get 5: We can try summing elements. $1+4=5$. So we need to use elements with residues 1 and 4.\n\n**Step 4: Find the smallest sums for residues 2 and 5**\n\nAny sum that results in a residue of 2 or 5 modulo 6 must involve an element $a_n$ where $a_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ or $a_n \\equiv 4 \\pmod 6$ (or other combinations).\nThe key is that to get a residue of 2 or 5, the sum must involve an element with residue 1 or 4, as sums of {0, 3} only produce {0, 3}.\nLet's find the smallest sum that is congruent to 5 mod 6.\n- We need a sum of residues to be 5. The simplest is $1+4=5$.\n- The smallest element with residue 1 is $a_6=91$.\n- The smallest element with residue 4 is $a_3=28$.\n- The smallest sum with residue 5 is therefore $a_3 + a_6 = 28 + 91 = 119$.\n- Any other combination would be larger (e.g., $a_3+a_{12}$ or $a_9+a_6$).\n- Any integer $M < 119$ with $M \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$ cannot be formed. The largest such number is $119 - 6 = 113$.\n\nLet's find the smallest sum that is congruent to 2 mod 6.\n- We need a sum of residues to be 2. The simplest is $1+3+4=8 \\equiv 2$.\n- The smallest element with residue 1 is $a_6=91$.\n- The smallest element with residue 3 is $a_2=15$.\n- The smallest element with residue 4 is $a_3=28$.\n- The smallest sum with residue 2 is therefore $a_2 + a_3 + a_6 = 15 + 28 + 91 = 134$.\n- Any integer $M < 134$ with $M \\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$ cannot be formed. The largest such number is $134 - 6 = 128$. Other unrepresentable numbers are 122, 116, etc.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the largest unrepresentable number**\n\nFrom Step 4, we have identified several unrepresentable numbers:\n- 113 (since $113 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$ and $113 < 119$)\n- 122 (since $122 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$ and $122 < 134$)\n- 128 (since $128 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$ and $128 < 134$)\n- 133 (since $133 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, wait, let's re-verify)\nLet's check 133. $133=119+14$. $133=a_3+a_6+14$. 14 is not in C(S).\n$133 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$. `133-91=42`. `42` is not a sum of `{6,15,28,45,66}`.\nThe largest unrepresentable number based on the modular argument appears to be the largest number $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$ that is less than 134. This would be $134-2=132$? No, $134-6=128$.\nLet's check the number immediately preceding the smallest sum of residue 2.\nThe smallest sum $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$ is 134. Thus, any number $M < 134$ with $M \\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$ cannot be formed. The largest such number is 128.\nThe smallest sum $\\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$ is 119. Thus, any number $M < 119$ with $M \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$ cannot be formed. The largest such number is 113.\nBetween 113 and 128, the number 128 is larger.\n\nHowever, we need to consider all unrepresentable numbers. The largest one will define $N$.\nThe largest unrepresentable number we've found so far is 128. Could there be a larger one with a different residue?\nFor example, let's check 133. $133 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$.\nTo form 133, we can try `sum = 133`.\n- `133 - a_7 = 133 - 120 = 13`. (13 is not representable).\n- `133 - a_6 = 133 - 91 = 42`. To make 42 from `{6,15,28,45,66}`: `42=28+14` (no), `42=15+27` (no), `42=6+36` (no). So 42 is not representable from the remaining set.\nIt appears 133 is not representable.\nSince 134 is representable ($a_2+a_3+a_6$), 133 is the largest unrepresentable number.\n\n**Step 6: Final determination of N**\n\nThe largest integer that cannot be written as a sum of distinct elements of $S$ is $g=133$.\nTherefore, the smallest number $N$ such that any number $\\ge N$ can be written as such a sum is $g+1$.\n$N = 133 + 1 = 134$.\n\nFinal check:\n- Largest unrepresentable number seems to be 133.\n- Smallest number $N$ is 134.\n\nFinal computation of smallest sums for each residue mod 6:\n- Res 0: 6 ($a_1$)\n- Res 1: 91 ($a_6$)\n- Res 2: 134 ($a_2+a_3+a_6$)\n- Res 3: 15 ($a_2$)\n- Res 4: 28 ($a_3$)\n- Res 5: 119 ($a_3+a_6$)\n\nAny number $M \\ge 134$ can be written as a sum. We don't provide a full proof here, but it relies on the fact that once we have sums for all residues, and the gaps between available numbers of a given residue are not too large, we can form all sufficiently large numbers. The number 133 is the largest unrepresentable number found through this analysis."
