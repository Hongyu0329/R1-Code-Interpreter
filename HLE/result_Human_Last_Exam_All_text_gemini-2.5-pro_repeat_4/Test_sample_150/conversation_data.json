    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided program against the problem's requirements, followed by an efficiency analysis of an optimal C implementation.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Requirements\n\n1.  **Initial State:** A variable `x` starts at 0.\n2.  **Input:** An integer `n` followed by `n` lines, each containing a \"statement\".\n3.  **Statement:** A statement is a string consisting of one variable `X` and one operation (`++` or `--`).\n4.  **Key Constraint:** \"The operation and the variable can be written in any order.\" This implies there are four possible valid statements:\n    *   Increment operations: `++X` and `X++`\n    *   Decrement operations: `--X` and `X--`\n5.  **Task:** Execute all `n` statements and print the final value of `x`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Submitted Java Program\n\n1.  **Initialization:** `int tresult = 0;` correctly initializes the counter variable corresponding to `x`.\n2.  **Looping:** `while (t-- > 0)` correctly iterates `n` times.\n3.  **Input Reading:** `String test = inpt.next();` correctly reads each statement string.\n4.  **Core Logic:**\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\")) { tresult++; }`\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\")) { tresult--; }`\n5.  **Flaw Identification:** The logic only checks for the substrings `\"++X\"` and `\"--X\"`. It fails to handle the other two valid cases specified by the problem: `X++` and `X--`. If the input is `X++`, `test.contains(\"++X\")` is false, so `tresult` is not incremented. The same issue exists for `X--`.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided program is **incorrect** as it does not handle all possible valid inputs.\n\n### Step 3: Design an Optimal C Solution and Analyze its Efficiency\n\nSince the provided program is incorrect, we must design a correct and efficient C program to determine the requested metrics (`x` and `y`). \"Efficient\" implies the fastest execution time (fewest operations) and the least memory usage.\n\n**Optimal Logic:**\nThe key to an efficient solution is to find the simplest possible way to distinguish an increment operation from a decrement operation. All four statement strings (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`) are three characters long. Let's inspect the characters at each position:\n\n*   Position 0: Can be `+`, `X`, or `-`.\n*   Position 1: Can be `+`, `X`, or `-`.\n*   Position 2: Can be `+`, `X`, or `-`.\n\nNotice that the character at the middle position (index 1) is always unique to the operation type:\n*   For `++X` and `X++`, the character at index 1 is `+`.\n*   For `--X` and `X--`, the character at index 1 is `-`.\n\nTherefore, we only need to check the character at index 1 of the input string to decide whether to increment or decrement `x`.\n\n**Efficiency Metrics:**\n\n1.  **x (Smallest number of character comparisons for 100 instructions):**\n    *   For each of the 100 input statements, our optimal logic reads the string and performs exactly **one** character comparison (e.g., `if (statement[1] == '+')`).\n    *   Total comparisons for 100 instructions = 100 instructions × 1 comparison/instruction = **100**.\n    *   This is the minimum possible, as at least one part of the input must be inspected to make a decision.\n    *   Therefore, `x = 100`.\n\n2.  **y (Smallest memory size in Bytes):**\n    *   To solve this problem, we need to store a few pieces of information. The memory usage is the sum of the sizes of the variables required. On a typical system:\n        *   An `int` to store the number of statements, `n`. (4 bytes)\n        *   An `int` to store the final value of `x`. (4 bytes)\n        *   A character buffer to read each statement string. The string is 3 characters long, so we need a buffer of size 4 to include the null terminator (`\\0`). `char statement[4];` (4 bytes)\n    *   Minimal memory size = (size of `n`) + (size of `x`) + (size of buffer) = 4 + 4 + 4 = **12 bytes**.\n    *   Therefore, `y = 12`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe final answer should be in the format `Nx+y`.\n*   The program is incorrect, so we start with `N`.\n*   The value of `x` is 100.\n*   The value of `y` is 12.\n\nCombining these parts gives the final answer.\n\n<<<N100+12>>>"
