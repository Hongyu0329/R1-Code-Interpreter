The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial. Due to the Sun's rotation combined with the outward flow of the solar wind, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) forms a Parker Spiral. At 1 AU (the location of L1), the angle between the magnetic field and the radial direction is typically around 45 degrees.

The justification for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., in an RTN or GSE coordinate system) to calculate helicity is an **approximation** based on **Taylor's "frozen-in flow" Hypothesis**. This hypothesis assumes that the solar wind speed is much higher than the wave speed, so the time variations measured by a stationary spacecraft are primarily due to spatial structures being swept past it by the radial solar wind flow.

Therefore, the analysis is performed in a coordinate system aligned with the solar wind flow (which is radial) as a matter of convenience and simplification. However, this is not a physically rigorous approach for determining the intrinsic properties of the wave. A more accurate analysis would require transforming the magnetic field data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system or using Minimum Variance Analysis (MVA) to find the wave's natural propagation direction and calculate helicity in the plane perpendicular to it. Using a radial-based system measures a projection of the true helicity, which can lead to an underestimation of its magnitude.
