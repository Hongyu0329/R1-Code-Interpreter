    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Notation: 6-311G****\n    The notation `6-311G**` is for a Pople-style basis set. We need to understand what each part of the name means:\n    *   **G**: Stands for Gaussian, meaning the basis functions are Gaussian-type orbitals (PGFs).\n    *   **Hyphen (-)**: Separates the description of the core atomic orbitals from the valence atomic orbitals.\n    *   **`6-`**: This part describes the core orbitals. Each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is constructed from a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **`-311`**: This part describes the valence orbitals. It indicates a \"triple-split\" valence basis. This means each valence orbital is described by three CGFs.\n        *   The first CGF (the \"inner\" part) is constructed from **3** PGFs.\n        *   The second CGF (the \"middle\" part) is constructed from **1** PGF.\n        *   The third CGF (the \"outer\" part) is constructed from **1** PGF.\n    *   **`**` (two asterisks)**: These denote the addition of polarization functions.\n        *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a single set of d-type polarization functions to \"heavy\" atoms (i.e., all atoms other than H and He). These are typically uncontracted, meaning they consist of **1** d-type PGF.\n        *   The second asterisk (`*`) adds a single set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms (and He). These are also uncontracted, consisting of **1** p-type PGF.\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points and Dependencies**\n    *   **Atom Dependence**: The number of primitive Gaussians is not a single value for the entire basis set; it depends on the specific chemical element. The interpretation of the notation differs for hydrogen versus heavier atoms.\n    *   **Heavy Atoms vs. Hydrogen**: The `6-` notation applies to the core electrons of heavy atoms. Hydrogen has no core electrons, so its treatment is different. The two asterisks also apply to different types of atoms.\n    *   **Shared Exponents**: For Pople basis sets, the s- and p-orbitals in the same valence shell (e.g., 2s and 2p) are built from sets of primitive Gaussians that share the same exponents.\n\n3.  **Calculate Primitives for a Representative Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)**\n    Let's analyze a second-row atom like Carbon (C), which has core electrons (1s) and valence electrons (2s, 2p).\n    *   **Core (1s orbital)**: Described by the `6-` part. This contributes **6 PGFs**.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals)**: Described by the `-311` part.\n        *   The 2s orbital is a valence orbital. The total number of s-type primitives for it is the sum of the digits: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 s-type PGFs**.\n        *   The 2p orbitals are also valence orbitals and share exponents with the 2s orbital. Thus, there are also 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 p-type PGFs**.\n    *   **Polarization (first `*`)**: Since Carbon is a heavy atom, the first `*` applies. It adds one uncontracted d-type PGF. This contributes **1 d-type PGF**. The second `*` does not apply to Carbon.\n    *   **Total for Carbon**: 6 (from 1s) + 5 (from 2s) + 5 (from 2p) + 1 (from d-pol) = **17 PGFs**.\n\n4.  **Calculate Primitives for a Hydrogen Atom**\n    Now let's analyze a Hydrogen (H) atom.\n    *   **Valence (1s orbital)**: Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital. The `-311` description is applied directly to it. The number of s-type primitives is 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 s-type PGFs**.\n    *   **Polarization (second `*`)**: The second `*` applies to hydrogen. It adds one uncontracted p-type PGF. This contributes **1 p-type PGF**. The first `*` does not apply to Hydrogen.\n    *   **Total for Hydrogen**: 5 (from 1s) + 1 (from p-pol) = **6 PGFs**.\n\n5.  **Acquire the Final Answer**\n    The question is ambiguous as it does not specify an atom. The number of primitives is 17 for a second-row heavy atom and 6 for a hydrogen atom. In the context of computational chemistry questions, if an atom is not specified, the question usually refers to a representative heavy atom (like Carbon or another second-row element) where the main features of the basis set structure (core/valence split) are apparent. The addition of functions for hydrogen is seen as a further specification. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is to provide the number of primitives for a standard second-row heavy atom.\n\nFinal calculation for a second-row heavy atom:\n*   Core 1s primitives: 6\n*   Valence 2s primitives: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n*   Valence 2p primitives: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\n*   d-Polarization primitives: 1\n*   Total = 6 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 17\n\n<<<17>>>"
