**Management Plan:** The appropriate management follows a phased approach. **Phase 1 (Emergency):** Immediate medical referral to manage her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%), followed by dental emergency care including wound debridement, suturing, and prescription of antibiotics and analgesics. Replantation is not an option due to the 28-hour delay. **Phase 2 (Interim):** Fabrication of a temporary acrylic removable partial denture to maintain aesthetics and space while healing occurs. **Phase 3 (Definitive):** After 3-6 months and confirmation of stabilized diabetes, the most appropriate definitive treatment is a Removable Partial Denture (RPD).

**Cells of Interest:** The most critical cells are the **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells** on the roots of the avulsed teeth; their non-viability after 28 hours dictates that replantation will fail. Other key cells are **osteoblasts**, **osteoclasts**, and **fibroblasts** for healing the sockets, and **inflammatory cells** (neutrophils, macrophages) for the initial trauma response.

**Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Type and Material:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture**. The framework should be made of **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr)** alloy for strength and rigidity, with acrylic teeth and a pink acrylic base for aesthetics.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:** The **left second premolar** and **left central incisor** (the teeth adjacent to the gap) will be used for support via rests and clasps.
    *   **Stabilizing Abutments:** The **right canine** an
