    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Object and the Goal**\n    *   $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. This means $X$ is defined by the zero set of a generic homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n    *   Since $X$ is a hypersurface in the 3-dimensional complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, $X$ is a complex manifold of dimension 2.\n    *   As a real manifold, $X$ has dimension $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   Since $X$ is a projective variety, it is a compact manifold. As a complex manifold, it is also orientable.\n    *   The goal is to find the rank of the third homotopy group of $X$, denoted as $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X))$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part, which is equivalent to the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem**\n    The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem relates the topology of a complex submanifold to the ambient space. For a smooth hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups up to a certain degree.\n    *   **Theorem Statement (Homotopy version):** For a smooth complex hypersurface $X$ of dimension $m$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^{m+1}$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^{m+1}$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^{m+1})$ for $k < m$.\n    *   **Application:** In our case, $X$ has complex dimension $m=2$. The theorem implies that $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 2$.\n    *   For $k=1$, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n    *   The complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is simply connected for all $n \\ge 1$. Thus, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. This is a crucial intermediate result: **$X$ is simply connected.**\n\n3.  **Apply the Rational Hurewicz Theorem**\n    The Hurewicz theorem relates homotopy groups to homology groups. The rational version of this theorem is particularly powerful for computing ranks.\n    *   **Theorem Statement:** For any simply connected topological space $Y$, the Hurewicz map $h_n: \\pi_n(Y) \\to H_n(Y;\\mathbb{Z})$ induces an isomorphism between the rationalized groups: $\\pi_n(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_n(Y; \\mathbb{Q})$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n    *   **Application:** Since we have shown that $X$ is simply connected, we can apply this theorem. For $n=3$, we have:\n        $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n    *   By definition, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is the dimension of the vector space $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. The dimension of $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is the third Betti number, $b_3(X)$.\n    *   So, we have the equality: $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$. The problem is now reduced to computing the third Betti number of $X$.\n\n4.  **Apply Poincaré Duality**\n    Poincaré duality provides a relationship between the Betti numbers of a compact, orientable manifold.\n    *   **Theorem Statement:** For a compact, orientable, $d$-dimensional manifold $M$, the Betti numbers satisfy $b_k(M) = b_{d-k}(M)$.\n    *   **Application:** We established that $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-dimensional manifold (so $d=4$). Applying Poincaré duality, we get:\n        $b_3(X) = b_{4-3}(X) = b_1(X)$.\n    *   This means the third Betti number is equal to the first Betti number. Our task is now to compute $b_1(X)$.\n\n5.  **Compute the First Betti Number $b_1(X)$**\n    We can compute $b_1(X)$ using the information we already have.\n    *   The first Betti number $b_1(X)$ is the rank of the first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   From Step 2, we know that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. By the standard Hurewicz theorem, the first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$. Since $\\pi_1(X)$ is the trivial group, its abelianization is also trivial. Thus, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n    *   Alternatively, we could use the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for homology, which states that $H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})$ for $k < 2$. For $k=1$, we get $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})=0$, it follows that $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n    *   Since $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, its rank, $b_1(X)$, is 0.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    By chaining the results from the previous steps, we can find the final answer.\n    *   From Step 3: $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$.\n    *   From Step 4: $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$.\n    *   From Step 5: $b_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 0$.\n\n### List of Careful Points:\n*   The smoothness of the hypersurface is essential to ensure it is a manifold and that the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem applies.\n*   The fact that $X$ is a projective variety implies it is compact, which is a condition for Poincaré duality.\n*   The fact that $X$ is a complex manifold implies it is orientable, another condition for Poincaré duality.\n*   The dimension of $X$ as a real manifold is 4, which is crucial for the application of Poincaré duality ($b_3 = b_{4-3} = b_1$).\n*   The simple-connectedness of $X$ is the key to using the rational Hurewicz theorem to relate the rank of $\\pi_3$ to $b_3$.\n*   The degree of the hypersurface (quintic, i.e., degree 5) does not affect this particular calculation. The result holds for any smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The degree would be important for calculating other invariants like the second Betti number $b_2(X)$. For a quintic, one can calculate the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)=55$, leading to $b_2(X) = \\chi(X)-2 = 53$, but this is not needed to answer the question.\n\nThe final result is obtained through a solid chain of reasoning based on fundamental theorems of algebraic topology and geometry."
