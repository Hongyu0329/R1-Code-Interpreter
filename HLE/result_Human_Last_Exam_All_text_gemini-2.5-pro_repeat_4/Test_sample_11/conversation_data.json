    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A specific statute (law).\n    *   **Jurisdiction:** The modern State of Israel (i.e., post-1948).\n    *   **Key Concept:** The statute must be the *first* to *explicitly introduce* the concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*).\n    *   **Exclusions:** The final answer must not start with \"the\" and must not include the year the statute was enacted.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination of Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   A common answer might be the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is famous for establishing \"good faith\" as a general, overarching principle in Israeli contract law (in Sections 12 and 39). However, the question asks for the *first* statute, and 1973 is relatively late in Israel's legislative history. Therefore, we must look for earlier laws.\n    *   Another possibility is pre-state law that was absorbed into Israeli law, such as the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance**. This Mandate-era law does contain the concept of a \"holder in due course\" who must take an instrument \"in good faith.\" While it was part of the law of the State of Israel from its inception, it was not a statute passed by the Israeli Knesset. The question's wording, \"to explicitly introduce,\" strongly implies an original legislative act by the modern state's legislature, not the adoption of a pre-existing colonial-era law.\n\n3.  **Chronological Search for Original Knesset Legislation:**\n    *   We need to search for original laws passed by the Knesset that contain the explicit term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n    *   **The 1970s:** We've already established the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973 is likely too late.\n    *   **The 1960s:** This was a decade of major original Israeli legislation.\n        *   The **Land Law, 1969**, uses \"good faith\" in the context of competing property transactions.\n        *   The **Agency Law, 1965**, requires an agent to act in \"good faith.\"\n        *   The **Standard Contracts Law, 1964**, mentions acts \"not in good faith.\"\n        *   The **Appraisers Law, 1962**, requires an appraiser to act \"in good faith.\"\n        All of these are valid instances, but we are seeking the *first* one. The Appraisers Law of 1962 is the earliest of this group.\n\n4.  **Searching in the 1950s:**\n    *   We must continue our search into the first full decade of Israeli statehood.\n    *   A thorough review of early legislation reveals a key statute from this period.\n    *   The **Key Money Law, 1958** (חוק דמי מפתח, תשי\"ח-1958) was enacted to regulate a specific type of tenancy payment. Section 38 of this law deals with a landlord refusing to consent to a transfer of the lease. It gives the court the power to grant permission for the transfer if the landlord's refusal was \"not in good faith\" (שלא בתום-לב).\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   The Key Money Law was passed in 1958, which predates the Appraisers Law (1962) and all other candidates from the 1960s and 1970s.\n    *   It is an original piece of legislation passed by the Knesset.\n    *   It explicitly uses the term \"good faith.\"\n    *   Therefore, it is the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith.\"\n    *   As per the instructions, the answer should be the name of the statute without the definite article (\"the\") or the year.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **\"Introduce\" vs. \"Adopt\":** The distinction between a new law passed by the Knesset \"introducing\" a concept and the state \"adopting\" pre-existing Mandate-era law that already contained the concept is crucial. The question points to the former.\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Most Famous\":** It is important not to confuse the first statute with the most famous or most significant one. The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, made good faith a foundational principle of civil law, but it was not the first law to use the term.\n*   **Specificity:** The concept had to be \"explicitly\" in the statute's text, not merely implied or developed later by courts.\n*   **Formatting:** The final answer must adhere to the strict formatting rules provided in the prompt.\n\n<<<Key Money Law>>>"
