    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure**\n\n*   **Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge or a path.\n*   **10 Nodes:** The total number of nodes in the graph is `n = 10`.\n*   **Simplest Configuration:** The most standard and simplest configuration for a barbell graph with an even number of nodes (`2k`) is to have two cliques of size `k` connected by a single edge. In this case, `2k = 10`, so each clique is a complete graph of `k = 5` nodes.\n*   **Structure Summary:** The graph consists of two `K_5` (complete graphs with 5 nodes each). Let's call them Clique A and Clique B. A single edge connects one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B.\n*   **Bottleneck Edge:** This single connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\". It is the only bridge between the two dense communities.\n*   **Bridge Nodes:** The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge are called \"bridge nodes\". Let's call them node `u` (in Clique A) and node `v` (in Clique B).\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process**\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a two-stage random sampling process that occurs in each step:\n1.  A node `i` is selected uniformly at random from all `n` nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/n`.\n2.  Node `i` then selects one of its neighbors, `j`, uniformly at random. If node `i` has `d(i)` neighbors (its degree), the probability of choosing any specific neighbor `j` is `1/d(i)`.\n\nAn edge is \"sampled\" if it is the one chosen for the gossip exchange.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Degrees of the Bridge Nodes**\n\nTo find the probability, we need the degrees of the two bridge nodes, `u` and `v`.\n*   **Degree of node `u` (in Clique A):**\n    *   Node `u` is part of a `K_5` clique. In this clique, it is connected to the other `5 - 1 = 4` nodes.\n    *   Additionally, node `u` is connected to node `v` in Clique B via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the total degree of node `u` is `d(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Degree of node `v` (in Clique B):**\n    *   By symmetry, node `v` is also part of a `K_5` clique and connected to the bridge node `u`.\n    *   Its degree is also `d(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n\nThe bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events happens in a single step of the gossiping algorithm:\n1.  Node `u` is selected first, and then it chooses its neighbor `v`.\n2.  Node `v` is selected first, and then it chooses its neighbor `u`.\n\nWe calculate the probability of each event and add them together.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 1 (u is chosen, then v):**\n    *   Probability of choosing node `u` from `n=10` nodes: `P(u) = 1/10`.\n    *   Probability of `u` choosing neighbor `v` from its `d(u)=5` neighbors: `P(v | u) = 1/d(u) = 1/5`.\n    *   `P(Event 1) = P(u) * P(v | u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 2 (v is chosen, then u):**\n    *   Probability of choosing node `v` from `n=10` nodes: `P(v) = 1/10`.\n    *   Probability of `v` choosing neighbor `u` from its `d(v)=5` neighbors: `P(u | v) = 1/d(v) = 1/5`.\n    *   `P(Event 2) = P(v) * P(u | v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n    *   `P(bottleneck edge sampled) = P(Event 1) + P(Event 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50`.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nSimplifying the resulting fraction gives the final answer.\n`P = 2/50 = 1/25`\n\nAs a decimal, this is `0.04`.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
