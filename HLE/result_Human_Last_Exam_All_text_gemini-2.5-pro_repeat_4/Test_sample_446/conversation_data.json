    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Recognition Motif:** The question asks about peptides binding to integrin receptors. The most fundamental and widely recognized binding motif for a large family of integrins is the tripeptide sequence **RGD** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid). This sequence is found in extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin.\n\n2.  **Examine the Answer Choices:** All five peptide choices (A, B, C, D, E) contain the core RGD sequence. This indicates that the correct answer depends on the influence of the amino acids *flanking* the RGD motif, not just the presence of the motif itself.\n\n3.  **Consider the Importance of Conformation:** The affinity and specificity of an RGD-containing peptide for an integrin receptor are critically dependent on the three-dimensional conformation of the RGD loop. The flanking residues dictate this conformation. For high-affinity binding, the RGD sequence must be presented in a specific, constrained structure, typically a type of β-turn.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Role of Flanking Residues, Especially Proline:**\n    *   **Proline (P)** is a unique amino acid because its cyclic side chain restricts the rotation of the peptide backbone. This property makes it a potent \"turn-inducer.\" When placed C-terminal to the RGD sequence, it can help lock the peptide into the β-turn conformation that is optimal for receptor binding.\n    *   **Serine (S)** is a small, polar amino acid often found in turn regions and is the natural residue following the RGD in fibronectin.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Each Peptide based on Structure-Activity Principles:**\n    *   A. RGDMAA: Lacks any strong turn-inducing residues in the critical positions following the RGD sequence.\n    *   B. **RGDSPSS**: This peptide contains the sequence **RGDSP**. The Serine-Proline (SP) dipeptide immediately following the RGD is a classic and well-studied motif. The proline residue in the +2 position relative to Aspartate (D) is known to be highly effective at inducing the required β-turn conformation. This sequence closely mimics the RGD loop of fibronectin and is known to be a high-affinity ligand for integrins like α5β1 and αvβ3.\n    *   C. RGDLTTP: While it contains Proline, the sequence RGDLT is generally less effective at forming the ideal conformation compared to RGDSP.\n    *   D. RGDQVSK: Lacks Proline and does not have a sequence known to strongly promote the necessary turn structure.\n    *   E. RGDARGG: Lacks Proline. The presence of multiple flexible Glycine (G) residues might even increase the conformational entropy, making it less likely to adopt the specific, high-affinity binding conformation.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The peptide **RGDSPSS** contains the RGDSP motif, which is well-established in scientific literature as a potent inhibitor of integrin-mediated cell adhesion due to its ability to form a stable, high-affinity binding conformation. Therefore, it is the most likely peptide among the choices to bind an integrin receptor with high affinity in an in vitro assay.\n\n<<<B>>>"
