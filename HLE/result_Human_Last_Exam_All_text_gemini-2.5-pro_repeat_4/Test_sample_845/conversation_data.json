    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Statement:** The question is based on the statement: \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats.\"\n2.  **Identify the Key Information:**\n    *   **Technology Used:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture data.\n    *   **Data Captured:** The raw data is \"beat-to-beat intervals.\"\n    *   **The Goal:** The question asks for the specific name of the \"value\" or \"interval\" that occurs between two consecutive heartbeats.\n3.  **Relate to Physiology:** A heartbeat is a complex event. In cardiology, the most prominent spike in an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, representing ventricular depolarization, is called the \"R-wave.\" The time between two consecutive R-waves is the fundamental measurement used for HRV.\n4.  **Connect to the Technology (PPG):** While an ECG measures electrical activity (R-waves), a PPG measures changes in blood volume (the pulse wave). The time between the peaks of two consecutive pulse waves corresponds to the time between two heartbeats.\n5.  **Synthesize and Determine the Terminology:**\n    *   The time measured between two consecutive heartbeats is the fundamental unit for all HRV calculations.\n    *   In the context of ECG (the gold standard), this is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   In the context of PPG, it is more technically called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** or **Peak-to-Peak (P-P) interval**.\n    *   However, in the field of HRV analysis, the term **R-R interval** is widely and universally used as the standard term for the time between heartbeats, even when the data is collected via PPG. It is the most common and recognized name for this value.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **R-R Interval vs. IBI:** While \"Inter-beat Interval\" (IBI) is technically more accurate for PPG data, \"R-R interval\" is the industry-standard and most widely understood term for the beat-to-beat interval in HRV analysis, regardless of the sensor used.\n*   **Individual Value vs. HRV Metric:** The question asks for the name of the *individual interval* between two beats, not the statistical metrics calculated from a series of these intervals (like RMSSD, SDNN, pNN50, etc.). These metrics *describe* the variability, but the R-R interval *is* the underlying value measured.\n*   **NN Interval:** A closely related term is \"NN interval\" (Normal-to-Normal interval). This refers to a series of R-R intervals that have been filtered to remove abnormal beats (arrhythmias, artifacts). For calculation, NN intervals are used, but the fundamental value being measured is still the R-R interval.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The question asks for the name of the value measured between heartbeats.\n2.  This value is a duration, specifically the time interval between one beat and the next.\n3.  The most common and standard term for this interval in the context of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the **R-R interval**.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
