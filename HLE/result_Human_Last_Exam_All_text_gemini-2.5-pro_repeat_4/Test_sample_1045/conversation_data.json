    "Of course. Let's break down this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe goal is to determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions (which are also known as basis functions) for a calculation on the toluene molecule (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atom count of toluene.**\nToluene has the chemical formula C₇H₈.\nThis means the molecule consists of:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation for each type of atom.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n*   **For a Carbon (C) atom (a second-row element):**\n    *   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The `6-` part of the name indicates that the core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF). This single CGF is formed by combining 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). This gives us **1 CGF for the core**.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The `-31` part indicates that the valence shell is \"split\" into two parts, meaning each valence orbital is represented by two basis functions of different sizes (an inner and an outer part).\n        *   The inner valence orbitals are described by one set of CGFs. For carbon, this includes one s-type function (for 2s) and three p-type functions (for 2px, 2py, 2pz). Each of these CGFs is built from 3 PGFs (the `3` in `-31`). This gives us 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs for the inner valence**.\n        *   The outer valence orbitals are described by a second set of CGFs. This also includes one s-type function and three p-type functions. Each of these CGFs is a single, uncontracted PGF (the `1` in `-31`). This gives us 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs for the outer valence**.\n    *   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n*   **For a Hydrogen (H) atom (a first-row element):**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons; its 1s orbital is its valence orbital. The notation `-31` applies to this valence orbital.\n    *   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The 1s orbital is split into two basis functions.\n        *   An inner, more contracted part, built from 3 PGFs (the `3` in `-31`). This gives **1 CGF**.\n        *   An outer, more diffuse part, built from a single PGF (the `1` in `-31`). This gives **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene molecule.**\nNow we multiply the number of functions per atom by the number of atoms of that type in the molecule and sum the results.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:**\n    *   (Number of C atoms) × (Number of CGFs per C atom) = 7 × 9 = **63 CGFs**\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:**\n    *   (Number of H atoms) × (Number of CGFs per H atom) = 8 × 2 = **16 CGFs**\n\n**Step 4: Sum the contributions to find the final answer.**\n*   Total CGFs = (CGFs from Carbon) + (CGFs from Hydrogen)\n*   Total CGFs = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Atom Count:** Always start by correctly identifying the number of each type of atom in the molecule (C7H8 for toluene).\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Understand that the notation (e.g., 6-31G) is interpreted differently for first-row elements (like H) and second-row elements (like C). Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the entire notation applies to its valence shell.\n3.  **Split Valence:** The \"split\" in a split-valence basis set like 6-31G refers to representing the valence shell with more than one basis function per atomic orbital, allowing for more flexibility in describing chemical bonding. For 6-31G, the valence shell is described by two functions (an inner and an outer one).\n4.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for *contracted* functions (CGFs), which are the basis functions used in the calculation. Do not confuse these with the underlying *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs) from which they are built.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n*   Number of Carbon atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 8\n*   Functions per Carbon atom (6-31G) = 9\n*   Functions per Hydrogen atom (6-31G) = 2\n*   Total Functions = (7 * 9) + (8 * 2) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
