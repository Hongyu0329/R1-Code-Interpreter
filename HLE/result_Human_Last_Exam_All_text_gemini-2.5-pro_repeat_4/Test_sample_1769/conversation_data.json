    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the core of the question\nThe question asks for a hypothetical Modern English word. It presents a counterfactual scenario: what if the Norse (Vikings) had not invaded and settled in England between the 7th and 12th centuries? To answer this, we must understand the origin of our current word \"sister\" and determine what the native English word would have evolved into without outside influence.\n\n### Step 2: Trace the etymology of the current word \"sister\"\n*   The Modern English word **sister** comes from the Middle English *sister* or *suster*.\n*   This Middle English form was not a direct evolution of the native Old English word. Instead, it was borrowed from, or heavily influenced by, the Old Norse word **systir**.\n*   The Old Norse *systir* and the original Old English word are **cognates**, meaning they both descend from the same ancient root, the Proto-Germanic word **\\*swestēr**.\n*   The key takeaway is that our modern word \"sister\" is a result of Norse linguistic influence. The presence of the \"i\" vowel and the hard \"s\" sound (as opposed to a more complex vowel sound) are characteristic of the Norse form taking precedence.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the native Old English word for \"sister\"\n*   Before the Norse influence became dominant, the Anglo-Saxons had their own word for sister. This word was **sweostor**.\n*   It was pronounced roughly as \"sweh-os-tor\". This is the word that would have continued its natural evolution in a timeline without Norse contact.\n\n### Step 4: Project the phonological evolution of \"sweostor\" into Modern English\nTo figure out what *sweostor* would have become, we need to apply the known rules of sound change that transformed Old English into Middle and then Modern English.\n\n1.  **Initial Consonant Cluster (`sw-`):** This cluster was stable in English, as seen in words like *swan*, *swim*, and *swing*. It likely would have remained.\n\n2.  **The Vowel Sound (`-eo-`):** This is the most complex part. The Old English diphthong *eo* had several different evolutionary paths depending on the sounds around it. In the case of *sweostor*, the presence of the preceding `w` would have had a rounding effect on the vowel.\n    *   A very common development for the *eo* sound, especially when influenced by a `w`, was for it to become `u`. We see this exact parallel in another Old English word: *sweord* (sword) became Middle English *swurd* and then Modern English *sword* (with the `u` sound represented by the letter `o`).\n    *   Following this strong precedent, Old English *sweostor* would have most likely evolved into Middle English **swuster**.\n\n3.  **The Loss of `w`:** In the `sw-` cluster, the `w` sound was sometimes lost, especially before a rounded vowel like `u`. For example, the modern pronunciation of *sword* is /sɔːrd/, without a /w/ sound. Similarly, the Old English word *swilc* became *such*. Following this pattern, Middle English *swuster* would likely simplify further to **suster**. This form is in fact attested in many English dialects that were less affected by Norse influence and preserved the native word.\n\n4.  **Final Evolution to Modern English:** The Middle English word *suster* would then undergo the Great Vowel Shift. The vowel `u` (pronounced like the \"u\" in \"put\") would shift to `ʌ` (the \"u\" sound in \"cut\" or \"duster\").\n    *   Therefore, the Middle English **suster** (pronounced \"sooster\") would become the Modern English **suster** (pronounced \"suh-ster,\" rhyming with \"duster\" or \"muster\").\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **The \"i\" is Norse:** The most telling sign of Norse influence in the word \"sister\" is the \"i\" vowel, which comes directly from the Old Norse *systir*. A purely English evolution would not have produced this vowel.\n*   **Dialectal Evidence:** The survival of the form *suster* in various English dialects for many centuries is powerful evidence that this was the natural, native development of the word before the Norse-influenced *sister* became the standard.\n*   **Cognates vs. Direct Descendants:** It is crucial to distinguish between a cognate (a related word from another language) and a direct descendant. \"Sister\" is a borrowed cognate that replaced the native direct descendant of the Proto-Germanic word.\n*   **Analogical Changes:** The evolution of *sweord* to *sword* provides a strong and direct analogy for the likely evolution of *sweostor*.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English *sweostor* would have undergone a natural series of sound changes. The most probable result, supported by phonological rules and surviving dialectal forms, would be the word **suster**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
