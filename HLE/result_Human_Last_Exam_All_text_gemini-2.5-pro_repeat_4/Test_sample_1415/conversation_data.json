    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\nThe integral we need to evaluate is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx.\nThis integral is in the form of ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx.\nLet's use the substitution method. Let u = f(x). Then, the differential du = f'(x) dx.\nSubstituting these into the integral gives:\n∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + C\nReplacing u back with f(x), we get:\n∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx = ln|f(x)| + C.\nIn our specific problem, f(x) is F₃(x). So, the antiderivative of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln|F₃(x)|.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Definite Integral**\nWe need to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n∫[a, b] g(x) dx = G(b) - G(a), where G'(x) = g(x).\nHere, g(x) = F₃'(x)/F₃(x) and the antiderivative G(x) = ln|F₃(x)|.\nSo, the definite integral is:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this can be written as:\nV = ln( |F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)| )\n\n**Step 3: Define and Evaluate F₃(x) at the limits x=0 and x=1**\nThe functions are defined as follows:\nF₀(x) = x\nF₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\nF₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\nF₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\nNow, we evaluate F₃(x) at x = 0:\nF₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\nSince sin(0) = 0 and e⁰ = 1:\nF₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\nNext, we evaluate F₃(x) at x = 1 (remembering that x is in radians):\nF₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 4: Check the sign of F₃(x) on the interval [0, 1]**\nFor x in the interval [0, 1], the value of sin(x) is between sin(0) = 0 and sin(1) ≈ 0.841.\nSince sin(x) ≥ 0 on this interval, e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1.\nTherefore, 1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe natural logarithm of a number greater than or equal to 2 is always positive. So, F₃(x) > 0 for x in [0, 1].\nThis means we can drop the absolute value signs: |F₃(x)| = F₃(x).\nThe value of the integral V is:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )\nSubstituting the expressions for F₃(1) and F₃(0):\nV = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the numerical value of V**\nWe need to use a calculator to find the numerical value. Ensure the calculator is in radian mode.\n1.  sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098\n2.  e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.84147098) ≈ 2.3197748\n3.  1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.3197748\n4.  F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.3197748) ≈ 1.2009724\n5.  F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931472\n6.  V = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) ) ≈ ln( 1.2009724 / 0.6931472 ) ≈ ln(1.732604)\n7.  V ≈ 0.549658\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final requested value**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.549658 = 5496.58\nThe closest integer to 5496.58 is 5497.\n\n<<<5497>>>"
