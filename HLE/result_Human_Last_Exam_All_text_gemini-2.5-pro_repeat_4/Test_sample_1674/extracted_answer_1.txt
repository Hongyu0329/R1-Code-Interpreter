Yes, the theory can not hold. The original theory relies on inverting the system based on the transmission matrix `T` of the random medium. A birefringent medium introduces an additional, polarization-dependent phase transformation, represented by a matrix `B`. The new system's medium is described by the product `B*T` (or `T*B`), which is different from `T`. An inversion procedure based on `T^-1` is no longer valid for the new system, as it fails to account for the polarization transformation introduced by `B`. This fundamentally alters the input-output relationship in a way the original theory cannot predict or reverse.
