    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Conductor\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   The number is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Next, we factor 7657. Let's try small prime divisors. $7657$ is not divisible by 7 or 11.\n*   Dividing by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Finally, we factor 589. $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$. We check primes up to 23.\n*   Dividing by 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   The primes 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all distinct.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The conductor $d$ is a square-free integer. This is a crucial property that simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nAccording to the Chinese Remainder Theorem for Dirichlet characters, any character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free number $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\dots \\chi_{p_k}$.\nIn our case, $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for Primitivity and Order\nWe are looking for characters that are **primitive** and have **order 6**.\n\n*   **Primitivity Condition:** A character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_p$ with a square-free modulus $d = \\prod p$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_p$ is primitive. A character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if it is not the principal character (the character that is 1 for all inputs coprime to $p$). This is equivalent to saying that the order of $\\chi_p$ must be strictly greater than 1.\n    *   So, we must have $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_p) > 1$ for each $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n\n*   **Order Condition:** The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_7), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\n    We are given that this order must be 6.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Component Character Orders\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, the order of each component character, $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6. The divisors of 6 are $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\nCombining this with the primitivity condition ($\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_p) > 1$), the possible orders for each $\\chi_p$ are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe number of characters of a specific order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by $\\phi(k)$ (Euler's totient function), provided that $k$ divides the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p)=p-1$.\n\nLet's check if orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible for each prime factor:\n*   For $p=7$: $p-1 = 6$. The orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ all divide 6.\n*   For $p=13$: $p-1 = 12$. The orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ all divide 12.\n*   For $p=19$: $p-1 = 18$. The orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ all divide 18.\n*   For $p=31$: $p-1 = 30$. The orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ all divide 30.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** For all four prime factors of $d$, characters of order 2, 3, and 6 exist. This symmetry simplifies the counting.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Number of Valid Characters\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that each $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_p) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and their lcm is exactly 6.\n\nA robust way to count this is to first count all combinations where the orders divide 6, and then subtract the combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6.\n\n1.  **Total combinations where orders divide 6 (and are > 1):**\n    For each prime $p$, the number of available characters is the sum of the number of characters of order 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total choices for each $\\chi_p$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are four primes, the total number of tuples $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ where each component has order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n2.  **Subtract combinations where lcm is a proper divisor of 6:**\n    The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. Since all orders are greater than 1, the lcm cannot be 1. So we only need to subtract cases where the lcm divides 2 or 3.\n\n    *   **Case A: lcm divides 3.**\n        This happens if and only if the order of every component character divides 3. Since orders must be > 1, this means $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_p) = 3$ for all $p$.\n        The number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        The number of such tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n    *   **Case B: lcm divides 2.**\n        This happens if and only if the order of every component character divides 2. Since orders must be > 1, this means $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_p) = 2$ for all $p$.\n        The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        The number of such tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The set of characters whose orders all divide 3 is disjoint from the set whose orders all divide 2. Therefore, we can simply add the counts for these two \"bad\" cases.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations where orders divide 6, minus the number of combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6.\n    Number = (Total combinations) - (lcm divides 3) - (lcm divides 2)\n    Number = $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nFinal check using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (via Mobius inversion on the lattice of divisors):\nLet $A(k)$ be the number of characters of order exactly $k$. Let $F(k)$ be the number of characters of order dividing $k$.\n$A(6) = F(6) - F(3) - F(2) + F(1)$.\n*   $F(6)$: Number of characters where order divides 6. Each component order is in $\\{2,3,6\\}$. Number of choices for each is $5$. Total $5^4=625$.\n*   $F(3)$: Number of characters where order divides 3. Each component order is $3$. Number of choices for each is $2$. Total $2^4=16$.\n*   $F(2)$: Number of characters where order divides 2. Each component order is $2$. Number of choices for each is $1$. Total $1^4=1$.\n*   $F(1)$: Number of characters where order divides 1. Order is 1. Not primitive. Total $0$.\n$A(6) = 625 - 16 - 1 + 0 = 608$.\nThe result is consistent."
