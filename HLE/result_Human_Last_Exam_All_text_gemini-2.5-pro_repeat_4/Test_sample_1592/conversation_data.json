    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step 1: Locate Waskaganish\nFirst, we need to pinpoint the location of the Waskaganish gathering place.\n*   Waskaganish is a Cree community in Quebec, Canada.\n*   It is located on the south shore of the Rupert River, near where it flows into the southeastern part of James Bay.\n*   Its approximate coordinates are 51.48째 N latitude, 78.76째 W longitude.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories\nNext, we identify the provinces and territories that share a border with Quebec.\n*   **Ontario:** To the west and southwest of Quebec. The border runs south from James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** To the north. This territory includes the land north of Quebec and also all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east of Quebec.\n*   **New Brunswick:** To the southeast of Quebec.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Proximity to Waskaganish\nNow, we evaluate the distance from Waskaganish to each of these neighboring provinces and territories. The question asks for the closest one.\n\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador & New Brunswick:** Looking at a map of Canada, these provinces are located far to the east and southeast of Waskaganish, respectively. The distances are in the range of many hundreds of kilometers. They are not strong candidates.\n\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands in James Bay. The largest and most prominent island in James Bay is Akimiski Island. While this island is geographically closer to the Ontario mainland coast, it is politically part of Nunavut. The distance from Waskaganish on the southeastern coast of James Bay, across the water to the nearest point on Akimiski Island, is approximately 140 kilometers (about 87 miles).\n\n*   **Ontario:** The border between Quebec and Ontario runs north-south, reaching the southern coast of James Bay just west of Waskaganish. Waskaganish is located at approximately 78.76째 W longitude. The land border with Ontario to the south of James Bay is a straight line along the 79.52째 W longitude meridian. The straight-line distance from Waskaganish to this land border to its southwest is only about 55-60 kilometers (about 34-37 miles). The closest point of the Ontario mainland, across a small stretch of Hannah Bay (part of James Bay), is even closer.\n\n### Step 4: Compare and Conclude\nBy comparing the distances, we can draw a conclusion.\n*   Distance to Ontario border: ~55-60 km.\n*   Distance to Nunavut (Akimiski Island): ~140 km.\n*   Distances to Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick are significantly greater.\n\nThe shortest distance from Waskaganish to a province or territory outside of Quebec is to the border of Ontario.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Geographic vs. Political Boundaries:** It's crucial to use the official political boundaries. The islands in James Bay belonging to Nunavut are a key detail.\n*   **\"Closest\" Definition:** The analysis assumes \"closest\" means the shortest straight-line distance (\"as the crow flies\") to the border of the province or territory.\n*   **Location Precision:** Using the precise location of Waskaganish and the borders is important for an accurate comparison.\n*   **Exclusion Clause:** The question explicitly states \"outside of Quebec,\" which is why we are considering only the neighboring provinces and territories.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Ontario is the closest province or territory to Waskaganish.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
