    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the total memory used for its variables.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n*   **Input:** A string representing a mathematical sum, like \"3+2+1\".\n*   **Content:** The string only contains digits '1', '2', '3' and the '+' character.\n*   **Task:** Rearrange the numbers in the sum so they are in non-decreasing (sorted) order.\n*   **Output:** Print the new, sorted sum, like \"1+2+3\".\n*   **Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". We need to find the total memory `m` in bytes used by the variables in this program.\n*   **Input Size:** The input string `s` is at most 1000 characters long.\n\n### Step 2: Devising a Solution Strategy\n\nThere are two main approaches to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Counting Sort:** Iterate through the input string, count the occurrences of each number ('1', '2', '3'), and then construct the output string by printing the numbers in order according to their counts.\n2.  **In-Place Sort:** Extract the numbers from the input string into an array (or the beginning of the input string buffer itself), sort this array of numbers, and then print them, adding '+' between them.\n\nTo find the *most* memory-efficient solution, we need to analyze the memory usage of the variables for each approach.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Memory Requirements\n\nWe will assume a standard C environment where:\n*   `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n*   `sizeof(short)` = 2 bytes\n*   `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n\nThe most significant memory usage will be for the input string buffer. Since the string can be up to 1000 characters long, we need an array to hold it, plus one extra byte for the null terminator (`\\0`).\n\n*   **Input Buffer:** `char s[1001];` -> **1001 bytes**. This is a necessary variable for both approaches.\n\nNow, let's analyze the additional variables required for each strategy, aiming to use the smallest possible data types.\n\n#### Analysis of Approach 1: Counting Sort\n\nThis method counts the numbers and then prints them.\n1.  **Input Buffer:** `char s[1001];` -> **1001 bytes**.\n2.  **Counters:** We need to count the occurrences of '1', '2', and '3'. The maximum length of the string is 1000. The numbers appear at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), so the maximum number of terms is `(1000 / 2) + 1 = 501`. This count easily fits into a `short` type (which can hold values up to 32,767).\n    *   `short count1, count2, count3;` -> 3 * `sizeof(short)` = 3 * 2 = **6 bytes**.\n3.  **Loop Variable:** A variable is needed to loop through the input string. The index will go up to 1000, which also fits in a `short`.\n    *   `short i;` -> `sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n4.  **Printing Flag:** To avoid printing a `+` before the first number, we can use a small flag variable. A `char` is sufficient.\n    *   `char is_first_term = 1;` -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**Total Memory (Counting Sort):** 1001 + 6 + 2 + 1 = **1010 bytes**.\n\n#### Analysis of Approach 2: In-Place Sort\n\nThis method reuses the input buffer to store and sort the numbers.\n1.  **Input Buffer:** `char s[1001];` -> **1001 bytes**.\n2.  **Extraction & Sorting:** We first move all digits to the beginning of the `s` buffer. Then, we sort this section of the buffer. A simple sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort can be used.\n3.  **Variables needed:**\n    *   A variable to track the number of digits found. This will not exceed 501, so a `short` is fine. `short num_count;` -> **2 bytes**.\n    *   Loop variables for sorting. A nested loop (like in Bubble Sort) needs two index variables. We can use `short` for these as well. `short i, j;` -> 2 * `sizeof(short)` = **4 bytes**.\n    *   A temporary variable for swapping characters during the sort. A `char` is perfect for this. `char temp;` -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**Total Memory (In-Place Sort):** 1001 + 2 (for `num_count`) + 4 (for `i`, `j`) + 1 (for `temp`) = **1008 bytes**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Final Answer\n\nComparing the two approaches:\n*   Counting Sort Memory: 1010 bytes\n*   In-Place Sort Memory: 1008 bytes\n\nThe **In-Place Sort** approach is more memory-efficient by 2 bytes. It avoids the need for three separate counter variables by cleverly reusing the input buffer space.\n\nTherefore, the total memory `m` used for variables in the most memory-efficient C program for this problem is the sum of the sizes of the variables required for the in-place sort method.\n\n*   `char s[1001]` -> 1001 bytes\n*   `short num_count` -> 2 bytes\n*   `short i` -> 2 bytes\n*   `short j` -> 2 bytes\n*   `char temp` -> 1 byte\n*   **Total `m` = 1001 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 1008 bytes.**\n\n<<<1008>>>"
