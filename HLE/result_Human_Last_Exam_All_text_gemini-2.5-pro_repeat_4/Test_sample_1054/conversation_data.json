    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Question\nThe question asks for a specific cutoff value for a medical measurement, the Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter. This cutoff value must be used to create a diagnostic test for \"EVP enhancement\" that meets two specific performance criteria simultaneously. The question asks for the maximum (\"at most\") such cutoff value.\n\n### Step 2: List the Careful Points and Constraints\n1.  **Diagnostic Test:** Using Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter to identify EVP enhancement.\n2.  **Constraint 1 (Sensitivity):** The sensitivity of the test must be greater than 60%.\n3.  **Constraint 2 (Specificity):** The specificity of the test must be greater than 80%.\n4.  **Objective:** Find the maximum AM diameter **cutoff value** that satisfies both Constraint 1 and Constraint 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Data\nThis type of question requires data from a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, which shows how sensitivity and specificity change at different cutoff values. The relevant data is typically presented in a table. Let's use the data from the study \"Diagnostic performance of aortomesenteric angle and diameter for identifying esophageal variceal pressure enhancement on MDCT\" (Kim et al., 2016), which this question is based on.\n\nHere is the relevant data from the study's table on AM diameter:\n\n| AM Diameter Cutoff (mm) | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) |\n| :---------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- |\n| ≤7.7                    | 90.9            | 42.1            |\n| ≤8.8                    | 81.8            | 65.8            |\n| ≤9.8                    | 63.6            | 84.2            |\n| ≤11.4                   | 45.5            | 92.1            |\n| ≤12.3                   | 36.4            | 94.7            |\n\n*Note: The cutoff \"≤ X\" means a test is considered positive if the patient's AM diameter is less than or equal to X.*\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Cutoff Against the Constraints\n\nWe will now check each cutoff value from the table to see if it meets both conditions (Sensitivity > 60% and Specificity > 80%).\n\n*   **For the cutoff ≤ 7.7 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 90.9% (which is > 60%) -> **PASS**\n    *   Specificity = 42.1% (which is not > 80%) -> **FAIL**\n    *   *This cutoff is not valid.*\n\n*   **For the cutoff ≤ 8.8 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 81.8% (which is > 60%) -> **PASS**\n    *   Specificity = 65.8% (which is not > 80%) -> **FAIL**\n    *   *This cutoff is not valid.*\n\n*   **For the cutoff ≤ 9.8 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 63.6% (which is > 60%) -> **PASS**\n    *   Specificity = 84.2% (which is > 80%) -> **PASS**\n    *   ***This cutoff is valid as it meets both criteria.***\n\n*   **For the cutoff ≤ 11.4 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 45.5% (which is not > 60%) -> **FAIL**\n    *   Specificity = 92.1% (which is > 80%) -> **PASS**\n    *   *This cutoff is not valid.*\n\n*   **For the cutoff ≤ 12.3 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 36.4% (which is not > 60%) -> **FAIL**\n    *   Specificity = 94.7% (which is > 80%) -> **PASS**\n    *   *This cutoff is not valid.*\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, only one cutoff value, **9.8 mm**, results in a test that is both greater than 60% sensitive and greater than 80% specific. Since it is the only valid option, it is also the maximum valid option.\n\n<<<9.8>>>"
