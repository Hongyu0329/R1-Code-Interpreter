    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**The user wants me to find the next number in the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence and look for a simple pattern.**\nFirst, let's write down the sequence and the options.\nSequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nOptions: A. 291, B. 285, C. 171, D. 167\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the differences between consecutive terms (First-Order Differences).**\nThis is a common method for finding the pattern in a sequence.\n*   `a₂ - a₁ = 11 - 2 = 9`\n*   `a₃ - a₂ = 23 - 11 = 12`\n*   `a₄ - a₃ = 51 - 23 = 28`\n*   `a₅ - a₄ = 119 - 51 = 68`\n\nThe sequence of differences is: 9, 12, 28, 68. This sequence is not a simple arithmetic or geometric progression.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sequence of differences to find its underlying pattern.**\nLet's call the difference sequence D = {9, 12, 28, 68, ...}. We will try to find a relationship between the terms in D.\n*   Relationship between 9 and 12: `12 = 9 + 3`\n*   Relationship between 12 and 28: `28 = 12 * 2 + 4`\n*   Relationship between 28 and 68: `68 = 28 * 2 + 12`\n\n**Careful Point:** Notice that a consistent pattern emerges from the second term of the difference sequence (D). The pattern is: `D(n) = 2 * D(n-1) + C(n)`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the pattern of the numbers being added (the C(n) sequence).**\nFrom the previous step, we found the added numbers are 4 and 12.\n*   The sequence of added numbers C is: 4, 12, ...\n*   This is a simple geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term (`4 * 3 = 12`).\n\n**Step 5: Extrapolate the patterns to find the next terms.**\n1.  **Find the next term in the C sequence:** The next term will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n2.  **Find the next term in the difference sequence (D):** Using the pattern `D(n) = 2 * D(n-1) + C(n)`, the next difference `D(5)` will be:\n    `D(5) = 2 * D(4) + 36`\n    `D(5) = 2 * 68 + 36`\n    `D(5) = 136 + 36 = 172`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence.**\nThe missing term is the last given term (119) plus the next difference we just calculated (172).\n*   Missing Term = `a₅ + D(5)`\n*   Missing Term = `119 + 172`\n*   Missing Term = `291`\n\nThe result 291 matches option A.\n\n**Alternative Method Confirmation:**\nLet's check for a pattern of the form `a(n) = 3 * a(n-1) - X`.\n*   `a₃ = 23`, `3 * a₂ = 3 * 11 = 33`. So, `23 = 33 - 10`.\n*   `a₄ = 51`, `3 * a₃ = 3 * 23 = 69`. So, `51 = 69 - 18`.\n*   `a₅ = 119`, `3 * a₄ = 3 * 51 = 153`. So, `119 = 153 - 34`.\nThe numbers being subtracted are 10, 18, 34. Let's look at the differences in this sequence:\n*   `18 - 10 = 8`\n*   `34 - 18 = 16`\nThis is a geometric progression (8, 16, ...), so the next difference is `16 * 2 = 32`. The next number to subtract will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\nLet's calculate the missing term:\n*   `a₆ = 3 * a₅ - 66`\n*   `a₆ = 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
