    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** The question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n    *   **For what item:** A single-dose container ampule.\n    *   **What is the event:** From the time of puncture (or being opened/broken).\n    *   **What is the environment:** A sterile environment (implying an ISO Class 5 environment or better).\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** The date and/or time after which a preparation shall not be used, stored, or transported. It is determined from the time the preparation is compounded or the container is entered.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container:** A container holding a quantity of sterile drug intended for a single use. It does not contain an antimicrobial preservative.\n    *   **Ampule:** A sealed glass container that is broken at the neck to access its contents. Once opened, an ampule cannot be resealed, making it an open system.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** An environment meeting specific air quality standards, typically ISO Class 5, designed to prevent microbial contamination during sterile compounding.\n\n3.  **Consult Governing Standards:**\n    *   The primary standard for sterile compounding in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations\".\n\n4.  **Apply the Standard to the Specifics:**\n    *   USP <797> has specific rules for handling single-dose containers. It is crucial to distinguish between different types of single-dose containers, particularly vials and ampules.\n    *   **For Single-Dose Vials:** When a single-dose *vial* (with a rubber stopper) is punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment, its contents may be used for up to 12 hours.\n    *   **For Single-Dose Ampules:** An ampule is different. Once it is broken open, it is an open system exposed to the environment. It cannot be resealed to maintain sterility. Because of this high risk of contamination, USP <797> mandates that opened ampules must be handled differently.\n\n5.  **Determine the Rule for Ampules:**\n    *   According to USP <797>, the contents of an opened single-dose ampule must be used **immediately**.\n    *   The term \"immediately\" in this context means there is no allowance for storage. The required dose should be withdrawn, and any remaining contents must be discarded right away.\n    *   An opened ampule cannot be stored for any period, even in an ISO Class 5 environment. Therefore, it is not assigned a BUD for storage.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ampule vs. Vial:** This is the most critical distinction. The rules for a single-dose vial (up to 12-hour BUD in ISO 5) are often confused with the rules for an ampule. An ampule's physical nature (inability to be resealed) dictates the stricter rule.\n*   **\"Puncture\" vs. \"Opened\":** For an ampule, \"puncture\" is equivalent to breaking it open.\n*   **The Environment Doesn't Change the Rule:** Even though the ampule is opened in a high-quality sterile environment (ISO Class 5), the rule for immediate use still applies because it's an open, unsealable container.\n*   **No Storage Permitted:** The concept of a BUD implies a permissible storage period. For an opened ampule, there is no permissible storage period. The mandate is for immediate use and disposal of any unused portion.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis of USP <797> guidelines, a single-dose ampule, once opened, does not have a BUD for storage. It must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded.\n\n<<<According to USP <797> guidelines, a single-dose ampule, once opened (punctured), must be used immediately. It cannot be stored for any period, and any unused portion must be discarded. Therefore, it is not assigned a time-based Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for storage.>>>"
