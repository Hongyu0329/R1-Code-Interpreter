    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n1.  **\"Christian theologian\":** The individual must be a recognized thinker within the Christian tradition.\n2.  **\"first developed\":** This points to an early, foundational figure, not a later commentator or modern scholar. The originator of the ideas is key.\n3.  **\"specialized terminology\":** The theologian must have created specific terms or concepts, not just discussed the ideas in general language.\n4.  **\"describe changes in the laws of nature\":** The terminology must address how the regular, observable patterns of the physical world can be suspended, altered, or superseded.\n5.  **\"applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus\":** The terminology must be able to explain a miracle where a fundamental biological law is set aside.\n6.  **\"and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall\":** The terminology must also be able to explain the theological concept that the entire created order was negatively affected by the sin of Adam and Eve (e.g., introduction of death, decay, futility).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nBased on the history of Christian thought, several major figures dealt with miracles and the nature of creation.\n*   **Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130 – c. 202):** An early church father who wrote extensively about creation and redemption, but he didn't develop a systematic philosophical terminology for the laws of nature in the way the question implies.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430):** A foundational theologian for the Western Church. He wrote extensively on creation (in his commentary on Genesis), miracles (in *The City of God*), and the effects of the Fall. He is a very strong candidate.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274):** A medieval scholastic who systematically integrated Aristotelian philosophy with Christian doctrine. He developed a highly detailed classification of miracles and a theory of primary and secondary causality. He is also a strong candidate, but he came much later than Augustine.\n*   **John Calvin (1509 – 1564):** A key figure in the Protestant Reformation. He affirmed these doctrines but his primary focus was not on developing new philosophical terminology for how natural law operates.\n*   **C.S. Lewis (1898 – 1963):** A modern apologist who wrote the book *Miracles*. While his work is relevant, he is a recent figure building on a long tradition and thus not the one who \"first developed\" the core concepts.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Strongest Candidate, Augustine of Hippo**\nLet's check Augustine against the criteria.\n1.  **Christian Theologian:** Yes, one of the most influential in history.\n2.  **First Developed:** He is a very early figure who systematically addressed these issues, predating Aquinas by over 800 years.\n3.  **Specialized Terminology:** Yes. Augustine's key concept here is that of **\"seminal reasons\"** (*rationes seminales* or *logoi spermatikoi*). He argued that God, at the initial creation, embedded latent potentialities or \"seeds\" for all things that would ever come into being. The normal, predictable operation of nature is the unfolding of these seeds according to a regular pattern.\n4.  **Describe Changes in Laws of Nature:** Augustine used this framework to explain miracles. A miracle is not God acting *against* nature (*contra naturam*) in an absolute sense, because that would mean God is acting against His own will. Rather, a miracle is an event that is *beyond* the usual course of nature (*praeter cursum naturae*). It is the activation by God's direct will of a \"seminal reason\" that would not have sprouted in the ordinary course of events. This terminology allows for \"changes\" without implying that God's creation is flawed or that God is contradicting Himself.\n5.  **Applicable to the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth fits this model perfectly. God, by His direct will, activated the potential for a human being to be formed in Mary's womb without the ordinary process of sexual reproduction. It was an event *praeter cursum naturae*.\n6.  **Applicable to Alterations at the Fall:** Augustine is arguably the most important theologian on the doctrine of the Fall. He taught that the Fall fundamentally altered the state of humanity and the natural world. The introduction of death, disease, and \"thorns and thistles\" can be understood within his framework as a change in the conditions under which the \"seminal reasons\" operate. The created order, originally good, now operates in a state of corruption and futility because of sin, a change in its relationship with God and its own internal harmony.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nWhile Thomas Aquinas later developed a more rigid system of classifying miracles based on causality, **Augustine of Hippo** was the first to develop a sophisticated and specialized theological framework with specific terminology (*rationes seminales*, the distinction between *contra naturam* and *praeter cursum naturae*) that could account for both unique miraculous events like the virgin birth and a systemic change in the operation of nature resulting from the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
