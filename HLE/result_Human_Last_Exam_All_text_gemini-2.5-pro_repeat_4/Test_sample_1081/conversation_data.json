    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the nature of the group G**\n\n*   The question specifies that $G$ is a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   Reductive groups over a field are classified by their type (given by a Dynkin diagram) and additional data related to the Galois action on the diagram.\n*   The Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. This is a crucial point because it implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ is necessarily of the \"split\" or \"Chevalley\" type. There are no \"twisted\" forms for $E_8$.\n*   Therefore, $G$ is the split group of type $E_8$, and its group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points is denoted by $E_8(q)$.\n\n**Step 2: State the general formula for the number of rational maximal tori**\n\n*   We are looking for the number of maximal tori of $G$ that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A torus $T$ is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ if it is stable under the standard Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure on $G$.\n*   There is a well-established formula for this number in the theory of finite groups of Lie type. For a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by:\n    $$ N = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n    where $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the finite group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$, and $T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of a maximally split torus $T_0$.\n*   **Careful point:** Since our group $G$ is split, any split maximal torus is a maximally split torus. This formula is a non-trivial result, often derived by summing over all conjugacy classes of tori or by analyzing the rational points of the variety of maximal tori, $G/N(T_0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the order of the finite group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q) = E_8(q)$**\n\n*   The order of a finite group of Lie type is given by a general formula involving the rank, the number of positive roots, and the degrees of the fundamental invariants of its Weyl group.\n*   For a split group of type $E_8$:\n    *   The rank is $r = 8$.\n    *   The dimension of the group is 248. The number of roots is $248 - 8 = 240$. The number of positive roots is $N = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n    *   The degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ are: $d_1=2, d_2=8, d_3=12, d_4=14, d_5=18, d_6=20, d_7=24, d_8=30$.\n*   The order of $E_8(q)$ is given by the Chevalley-Steinberg formula:\n    $$ |E_8(q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i} - 1) $$\n    Substituting the values for $E_8$:\n    $$ |E_8(q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1) $$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the order of the group of rational points of a split maximal torus $T_0$**\n\n*   A split maximal torus $T_0$ of rank 8 is isomorphic over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ to the direct product of 8 copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$.\n    $$ T_0 \\cong (\\mathbb{G}_m)^8 $$\n*   The group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $T_0$ is therefore isomorphic to the direct product of 8 copies of the multiplicative group of the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    $$ T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times)^8 $$\n*   The order of the multiplicative group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $|\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times| = q-1$.\n*   Thus, the order of $T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is:\n    $$ |T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final number**\n\n*   Now, we substitute the orders calculated in Step 3 and Step 4 into the formula from Step 2:\n    $$ N = \\frac{|E_8(q)|}{|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\n*   To simplify this expression, we can factor out $(q-1)$ from each term $(q^{d_i}-1)$ in the numerator:\n    $$ N = q^{120} \\left(\\frac{q^2-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^8-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{12}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{14}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{18}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{20}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{24}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{30}-1}{q-1}\\right) $$\n*   Using the identity for the sum of a geometric series, $\\frac{q^k-1}{q-1} = 1 + q + q^2 + \\dots + q^{k-1}$, we obtain the final expression as a product of polynomials in $q$.\n\nThe exact number is the resulting polynomial expression in the variable $q$.\n\n***\n\n<<<q^{120} \\frac{(q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8}>>>"
