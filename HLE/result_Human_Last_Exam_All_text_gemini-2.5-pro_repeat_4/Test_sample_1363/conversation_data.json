    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing where the couple turns to their left. It's a foundational step in most of the dances listed.\n*   **Overturn:** To turn more than the standard, prescribed amount for a given figure. For example, if a standard turn is 3/8 of a circle, an overturned version might be 1/2 of a circle.\n*   **Technique:** This refers to the fundamental principles and mechanics of a specific dance style. This includes aspects like footwork (heel vs. toe leads), rise and fall, body sway, posture, Contrary Body Movement (CBM), and the overall character of the movement (e.g., smooth vs. staccato).\n*   **\"Impossible without disregarding the technique\":** This is the key phrase. It means that the very act of overturning the turn would force a dancer to violate one or more of the core technical rules of that dance. The question is not about whether it's physically possible to turn more, but whether it can be done while still executing the dance *correctly*.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Dance Option**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This is a swing dance with continuous rotation. The standard Reverse Turn rotates a full 360 degrees over 6 steps. While the dance is highly structured around this specific amount of turn, and overturning would disrupt the rhythm and flow, it is not technically *impossible*. A dancer could use more swing and power to turn slightly more. It would be poor form and break the character of the dance, but the fundamental mechanisms of swing and rotation still exist to allow it.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** This is the quintessential \"swing dance,\" characterized by pendulum swing, rise and fall, and body sway. Overturning figures, including the Reverse Turn, is a common and accepted part of advanced choreography and floorcraft (navigating around other couples). The technique of sway and swing is precisely what allows for this flexibility in the amount of turn. Therefore, it is definitely possible to overturn a Reverse Turn without disregarding the technique.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** This dance is fundamentally different from the others.\n    *   **Key Technique:** It has **no rise and fall** and **no body sway**. The movement is grounded, sharp, and staccato, often described as a \"cat-like\" walk. The feet are kept in close contact with the floor. Turns are executed with controlled body rotation and precise foot placements, not with momentum from swing.\n    *   **The Impossibility:** To overturn a Reverse Turn in Tango, a dancer would need to generate extra rotation. In swing dances, this is done with more swing, sway, and rise. Since these actions are forbidden in Tango technique, a dancer would have to resort to actions that violate the technique, such as creating a \"swing\" action, lifting the feet improperly for a pivot, or breaking the characteristic grounded walk. The core mechanics of the dance do not provide a legitimate way to add significant extra rotation. Thus, it's impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn *while maintaining correct Tango technique*.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, this is a swing dance known for its smooth, continuous, and gliding motion. It uses sway and CBM to create its character. Similar to the Waltz, overturning turns is a common and technically sound method used for floorcraft and creating different choreographic effects. The fundamental technique allows for it.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is a dynamic and fast swing dance. Its technique incorporates walks, runs, chasses, and hops. The high energy and speed demand flexibility in figures. Overturning turns is not only possible but often necessary to navigate the floor at speed and transition between different energetic patterns. The technique fully supports variations in the amount of turn.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the Analysis**\n\nThe swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) all possess the technical mechanics (sway, swing, rise and fall) that allow a dancer to increase or decrease the amount of rotation in a turn as a variation or for floorcraft. The European Tango, by contrast, explicitly forbids these mechanics. Its technique is based on a grounded, progressive walk with no swing. This lack of swing mechanics makes it impossible to generate the extra momentum needed to overturn a Reverse Turn without breaking the fundamental rules of the dance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
