    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **$X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable:** It cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Hereditarily Indecomposable:** Every subcontinuum of $X$ is also indecomposable. This is a very strong property. The pseudo-arc is a key example of such a space.\n    *   **Metric:** There is a distance function defined on $X$. This implies $X$ is separable.\n*   **$x \\in X$:** We remove a single point from $X$.\n*   **$Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** This is the space we are working with. Since $X$ is compact and $\\{x\\}$ is closed, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact space.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification of $Y$ ($\\beta Y$):** This is the largest possible compactification of $Y$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder ($R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$):** This is the set of points added to $Y$ to form $\\beta Y$.\n*   **Composants of the Remainder:** We need to find the number of composants of the space $R$. A composant of a point $p$ in a continuum $K$ is the set of all points that lie in some proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing $p$. The entire space $K$ is partitioned into its composants.\n*   **Maximum Possible Number:** The properties of $X$ are given, but $X$ itself is not a specific, unique space. We need to find the maximum number of composants that can occur for any valid choice of $X$.\n\n**2. Characterize the Remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$**\n\n*   **Is $R$ a continuum?**\n    1.  An indecomposable continuum like $X$ has no cut-points. Therefore, removing a single point $x$ leaves the space connected. So, $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected.\n    2.  For a connected, locally compact, non-compact space, its Stone-Cech remainder is a continuum if and only if the space has exactly one \"end\". A space like $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a continuum, has precisely one end.\n    3.  Therefore, the remainder $R$ is a continuum (a compact, connected, non-empty space).\n\n*   **Is $R$ metrizable?**\n    1.  A theorem states that the Stone-Cech remainder of a locally compact space $Y$ is metrizable if and only if $Y$ is $\\sigma$-compact.\n    2.  A space is $\\sigma$-compact if it is a countable union of compact sets.\n    3.  Let $d$ be the metric on $X$. The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ can be written as the union $Y = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty K_n$, where $K_n = \\{p \\in X \\mid d(p, x) \\ge 1/n\\}$. Each $K_n$ is a closed subset of the compact space $X$, and is therefore compact.\n    4.  Since $Y$ is $\\sigma$-compact, its remainder $R$ is metrizable.\n    5.  So, $R$ is a **metric continuum**.\n\n**3. Determine the Upper Bound on the Number of Composants**\n\n*   For any metric continuum $K$, the number of its composants is at most $c$, the cardinality of the continuum ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n*   **Reasoning:** Every composant is an $F_\\sigma$ set (a countable union of closed sets). A separable metric space (which any metric continuum is) has a countable basis for its topology. This implies it has at most $c$ open sets, and thus at most $c$ closed sets and at most $c$ $F_\\sigma$ sets. Since distinct composants are disjoint, there can be at most $c$ of them.\n*   Therefore, the number of composants of $R$ is at most $c$.\n\n**4. Find an Example to Achieve the Maximum**\n\n*   To show that $c$ is the maximum possible number, we need to find a specific hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ for which the remainder has exactly $c$ composants.\n*   **Choice of $X$:** Let $X$ be the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is the prime example of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n*   **A Key Theorem:** A well-known theorem in continuum theory by D.P. Bellamy states that if $P$ is a pseudo-arc and $p \\in P$, then the remainder $\\beta(P \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (P \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is itself homeomorphic to a pseudo-arc.\n*   **Composants of the Remainder:**\n    1.  If we take $X$ to be the pseudo-arc, the remainder $R$ is also a pseudo-arc.\n    2.  The pseudo-arc is an indecomposable continuum.\n    3.  A classical theorem by Kuratowski states that any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $c$ composants.\n    4.  Therefore, for this choice of $X$, the remainder $R$ has $c$ composants.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   We have shown that the number of composants of the remainder $R$ is at most $c$.\n*   We have also shown that by choosing $X$ to be the pseudo-arc, the number of composants of the remainder $R$ is exactly $c$.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is $c$.\n\nThe number $c$ is also known as the cardinality of the continuum, which is equal to $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum possible number of composants is $c$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
