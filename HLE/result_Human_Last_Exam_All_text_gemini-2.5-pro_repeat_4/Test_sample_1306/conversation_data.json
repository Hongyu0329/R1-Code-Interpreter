    "Answering this question requires understanding the representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let's denote this algebra by $u_q$. The category of its indecomposable finite-dimensional representations is denoted by $C$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the algebra and its representation type\nThe algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is the algebra generated by $E, F, K$ with relations $E^3=F^3=0$, $K^3=1$, $KEK^{-1}=q^2E$, $KFK^{-1}=q^{-2}F$, and $[E,F]=\\frac{K-K^{-1}}{q-q^{-1}}$.\nThe representation theory of this algebra is well-known. It is of **tame representation type**. This means that for each dimension, the indecomposable modules fall into a finite number of discrete isomorphism classes and a finite number of one-parameter families.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the indecomposable representations\nThe set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable $u_q$-modules, which are the objects of the category $C$, can be partitioned into two main types:\n1.  **A discrete, countable family of indecomposable modules:** These are often called the modules of the principal block or the \"discrete part\". This set is infinite and corresponds to a component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of type $\\mathbb{Z}A_\\infty$.\n2.  **A continuous family of indecomposable modules:** This set consists of a family of so-called \"tubes\", parameterized by the points $\\lambda$ of the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$. For each $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$, there is a tube $T_\\lambda$, which is a countable set of indecomposable modules $\\{M_{k, \\lambda}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 1}}$.\n\n### Step 3: Classify the irreducible representations\nThe irreducible representations (also called simple modules) are the indecomposable modules that have no proper non-trivial submodules. The classification of simple $u_q$-modules is as follows:\n1.  **From the discrete part:** There are exactly two simple modules in the discrete family.\n    *   $L_1$: The trivial module of dimension 1.\n    *   $L_2$: A simple module of dimension 2.\n2.  **From the continuous part:** The modules at the \"mouth\" of the tubes are simple.\n    *   For each $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$, the module $M_{1, \\lambda}$ is a simple module of dimension 3.\n\nAll other indecomposable modules are reducible. Specifically:\n*   In the discrete part, all modules other than $L_1$ and $L_2$ are reducible. This is an infinite set of modules with dimensions growing indefinitely.\n*   In each tube $T_\\lambda$, the modules $M_{k, \\lambda}$ for $k > 1$ are reducible. The dimension of $M_{k, \\lambda}$ is $3k$. Thus, for each $\\lambda$, there is an infinite sequence of reducible indecomposable modules of dimensions $6, 9, 12, \\dots$.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the \"percentage\"\nThe question asks for the percentage of the objects of $C$ that are irreducible. The set of objects of $C$ (isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules) is infinite, so a standard percentage calculation is not possible. We must interpret this question in terms of a density or a limit. A natural approach is to consider the proportion of irreducible modules up to a given dimension $D$, and then take the limit as $D \\to \\infty$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of isomorphism classes of modules at each dimension $d$.\n*   **Irreducible modules:**\n    *   At $d=1$: one module ($L_1$).\n    *   At $d=2$: one module ($L_2$).\n    *   At $d=3$: a one-parameter family $\\{M_{1, \\lambda}\\}_{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1}$, i.e., an uncountably infinite set of modules.\n    *   At $d>3$: there are no irreducible modules.\n\n*   **All indecomposable modules:**\n    *   At any dimension $d$, there is a finite number of indecomposable modules belonging to the discrete part.\n    *   If $d$ is a multiple of 3, say $d=3k$, there is also a one-parameter family of indecomposable modules $\\{M_{k, \\lambda}\\}_{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1}$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the limit\nTo handle the continuous families, let's count the number of one-parameter families at each dimension.\nLet $c(d)$ be the number of one-parameter families of indecomposable modules at dimension $d$.\nLet $c_{irr}(d)$ be the number of one-parameter families of irreducible modules at dimension $d$.\n\nFrom our classification:\n*   $c(d) = 1$ if $d$ is a multiple of 3 ($d=3, 6, 9, \\dots$).\n*   $c(d) = 0$ if $d$ is not a multiple of 3.\n\n*   $c_{irr}(d) = 1$ if $d=3$.\n*   $c_{irr}(d) = 0$ if $d \\neq 3$.\n\nThe total number of one-parameter families of indecomposable modules up to dimension $D$ is:\n$N_{fam}(D) = \\sum_{d=1}^{D} c(d) = \\lfloor D/3 \\rfloor$.\n\nThe total number of one-parameter families of irreducible modules up to dimension $D$ is:\n$N_{fam, irr}(D) = \\sum_{d=1}^{D} c_{irr}(d) = 1$ for $D \\ge 3$.\n\nThe percentage can be understood as the limit of the ratio of these counts as the dimension $D$ goes to infinity:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\lim_{D \\to \\infty} \\frac{N_{fam, irr}(D)}{N_{fam}(D)} \\times 100\\% $$\nFor $D \\ge 3$, this ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lfloor D/3 \\rfloor} $$\nAs $D \\to \\infty$, the denominator $\\lfloor D/3 \\rfloor$ goes to infinity, so the limit is 0.\n$$ \\lim_{D \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\lfloor D/3 \\rfloor} = 0 $$\n\nTherefore, 0% of the objects of $C$ are irreducible in this natural sense. The reducible indecomposable modules vastly \"outnumber\" the irreducible ones."
