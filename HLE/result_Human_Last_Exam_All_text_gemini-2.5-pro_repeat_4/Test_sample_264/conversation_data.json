    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Define a Coordinate System and Place the First Cube**\n\nTo analyze the problem, we first set up a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's place the first cube, Cube A, in a standard position with one corner at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its edges aligned with the coordinate axes.\n\n*   **Cube A:** Occupies the region defined by the inequalities:\n    *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\nThe volume of Cube A is `1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand and Apply the Shift for the Second Cube**\n\nThe problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to the first one.\n\n*   **Main Diagonal:** The main diagonal of Cube A connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **v** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Shift Vector:** A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" means that the displacement is described by the vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This means every point in Cube B is shifted by 1/2 in the x-direction, 1/2 in the y-direction, and 1/2 in the z-direction relative to the corresponding point in Cube A.\n*   **Position of Cube B:** To find the region occupied by Cube B, we add the shift vector **s** to the coordinates of Cube A.\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Region of Intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the set of all points (x, y, z) that satisfy the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We need to find the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:**\n    *   Cube A: `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   Cube B: `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   The intersection of these two intervals is `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **For the y-coordinate:**\n    *   Cube A: `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   Cube B: `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   The intersection of these two intervals is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **For the z-coordinate:**\n    *   Cube A: `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n    *   Cube B: `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n    *   The intersection of these two intervals is `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\nThe resulting intersection is a shape defined by these new combined inequalities.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n\nThe region of intersection is defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\nThis describes a smaller cube. Let's find its side lengths:\n*   Length in x-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length in y-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Length in z-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths.\n*   Volume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Coordinate System Setup:** Placing the first cube at the origin with axis-aligned edges is the most critical step for simplifying the problem.\n2.  **Interpreting the \"Shift\":** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is key. The most standard interpretation in this context is a coordinate-wise shift, resulting in a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). An alternative interpretation (a shift of distance 1/2 in the direction of <1,1,1>) would lead to an irrational shift vector `(1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))` and a much more complex answer, which is unlikely for a problem of this type.\n3.  **Intersection Logic:** The intersection of two geometric regions is found by finding the intersection of their defining constraints. For axis-aligned boxes, this means finding the overlap of the coordinate intervals for each axis independently.\n4.  **Final Shape:** It's important to recognize that the intersection of two cubes (which are axis-aligned boxes) is also an axis-aligned box (in this case, another cube).\n\nThe final volume of the intersection is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
