    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where the schema $S$ contains $4$ unary predicates.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates, which we can denote as $S = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. A structure $\\mathcal{M}$ over this schema consists of a universe of discourse $U$ and interpretations for each predicate, which are subsets of the universe: $P_1^{\\mathcal{M}}, P_2^{\\mathcal{M}}, P_3^{\\mathcal{M}}, P_4^{\\mathcal{M}} \\subseteq U$.\n\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of first-order logic. Formulas in this language are constructed using:\n    *   Atomic formulas: $P_i(x)$, where $P_i \\in S$ and $x$ is a variable.\n    *   Logical connectives: Conjunction ($\\land$), True ($\\top$), False ($\\bot$).\n    *   Quantifier: Existential quantifier ($\\exists$).\n    *   Negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), implication ($\\to$), and universal quantification ($\\forall$) are not allowed.\n\n*   **Concept and Concept Class**: In this context, a concept is a set of elements from the universe defined by a formula with one free variable. For a given structure $\\mathcal{M}$, a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ defines the concept $C = \\{a \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(a)\\}$. The set of all such concepts definable by formulas in our logic fragment, within the structure $\\mathcal{M}$, is the concept class $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\n*   **VC Dimension of a Logic**: The VC dimension of a logic fragment $L$ is defined as the supremum of the VC dimensions of the concept classes formed over all possible finite structures.\n    $\\text{VCdim}(L) = \\sup \\{ \\text{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}) \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\text{ is a finite S-structure} \\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Concept Class $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$\n\nLet's fix an arbitrary finite structure $\\mathcal{M} = (U, P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4)$. We need to determine the set of concepts $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ that can be defined by formulas in our logic fragment.\n\nA general formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with one free variable $x$ can be written in the form:\n$\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas.\n\nSince the predicates are unary, each atomic formula involves only one variable. We can group the atoms by the variable they contain:\n$\\psi(x, \\bar{y}) = \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)\\right) \\land \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_1} P_i(y_1)\\right) \\land \\dots \\land \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_m} P_i(y_m)\\right)$\n\nApplying the existential quantifiers, the formula becomes:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)\\right) \\land \\exists y_1\\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_1} P_i(y_1)\\right) \\land \\dots \\land \\exists y_m\\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_m} P_i(y_m)\\right)$\n\nLet's analyze this form:\n*   The first part, $\\psi_0(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)$, depends on the free variable $x$.\n*   Each subsequent part, $\\chi_j = \\exists y_j\\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_j} P_i(y_j)\\right)$, is a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\n\nIn the fixed structure $\\mathcal{M}$, each sentence $\\chi_j$ is either true or false.\n*   $\\chi_j$ is true if the set $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_j} P_i^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is non-empty.\n*   $\\chi_j$ is false if the set $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_j} P_i^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is empty.\n\nSo, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to:\n*   $\\psi_0(x)$ if all sentences $\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_m$ are true in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n*   $\\bot$ (false) if at least one sentence $\\chi_j$ is false in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nTherefore, any set definable by a formula in our logic fragment within the structure $\\mathcal{M}$ must be either the empty set $\\emptyset$ (defined by $\\bot$) or a set defined by a simple conjunction of predicates applied to $x$. These are sets of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^{\\mathcal{M}}$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Note that when $I = \\emptyset$, the intersection is the entire universe $U$, which can be defined by the formula $\\top$.\n\nThe concept class for a fixed structure $\\mathcal{M}$ is:\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}} = \\left\\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^{\\mathcal{M}} \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\right\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Maximum VC Dimension\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible VC dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ by choosing the structure $\\mathcal{M}$ (i.e., the universe $U$ and the predicate interpretations $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$) cleverly.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nThe number of distinct concepts in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is at most the number of possible index sets $I$, which is $2^4 = 16$. For a concept class $\\mathcal{H}$ to shatter a set $X$, it must be able to generate all $2^{|X|}$ subsets of $X$. Thus, we must have $2^{|X|} \\le |\\mathcal{H}|$.\nIn our case, $2^{|X|} \\le 16$, which implies $|X| \\le 4$.\nThis means the VC dimension is at most 4, for any structure $\\mathcal{M}$. So, $\\text{VCdim}(\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]) \\le 4$.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists at least one structure $\\mathcal{M}$ for which $\\text{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}) \\ge 4$. This requires us to find a structure and a set $X$ of size 4 that can be shattered by the corresponding concept class $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\nLet's construct such a structure.\n*   Let the universe be $U = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4\\}$.\n*   Let the set to be shattered be $X = U$.\n*   Define the predicate interpretations $P_i^{\\mathcal{M}}$ as follows:\n    $P_i = U \\setminus \\{u_i\\}$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n    *   $P_1 = \\{u_2, u_3, u_4\\}$\n    *   $P_2 = \\{u_1, u_3, u_4\\}$\n    *   $P_3 = \\{u_1, u_2, u_4\\}$\n    *   $P_4 = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$\n\nNow, we must show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists an index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ such that $Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i$.\n\nLet $Y$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$. Consider its complement, $X \\setminus Y$. Let $J$ be the set of indices of the elements in the complement:\n$J = \\{j \\mid u_j \\in X \\setminus Y\\}$.\n\nNow, let's choose our index set for the intersection to be $I = J$. Let's compute the resulting concept:\n$\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i = \\bigcap_{j \\in J} P_j = \\bigcap_{j \\in J} (U \\setminus \\{u_j\\})$\nUsing de Morgan's laws, this is equivalent to:\n$U \\setminus \\left(\\bigcup_{j \\in J} \\{u_j\\}\\right)$\nBy definition of $J$, this is:\n$U \\setminus (X \\setminus Y)$\nSince $X=U$, this simplifies to:\n$X \\setminus (X \\setminus Y) = Y$\n\nSo, for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can generate it by choosing $I = \\{j \\mid u_j \\notin Y\\}$. This shows that the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered by the concept class $\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ for this specific structure $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\nTherefore, for this structure, $\\text{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_{\\mathcal{M}}) = |X| = 4$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have established two points:\n1.  The VC dimension is at most 4.\n2.  There exists a structure for which the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\nThe VC dimension of the logic is the supremum over all structures. Thus, the VC dimension is 4. This result generalizes: for a schema with $k$ unary predicates, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is $k$."
