    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (or square) lattice, a quantity denoted as a(10). This is a classic problem in combinatorics and statistical physics. A direct enumeration for 10 steps is highly complex, so we will build the logic step-by-step from smaller numbers of steps to understand the process, and then use the known, computationally-derived result for n=10.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A 2D grid of points (x, y) where x and y are integers.\n*   **Walk:** A sequence of connected points on the lattice, starting from an origin, say (0,0). Each step connects a point to one of its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step SAWs starting from the origin.\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The lattice is symmetrical. We can often calculate the number of walks starting in one direction (e.g., positive x) and multiply by 4.\n*   **Reversal:** A step cannot immediately reverse the previous step, as that would revisit the previous point. This is the simplest self-avoiding constraint.\n*   **Traps:** The primary difficulty in counting is that a walk can form a \"trap\" where its endpoint is adjacent to a point visited earlier in the walk (other than the immediately preceding point). This reduces the number of possible next steps.\n*   **Parity Rule:** A key observation is that after `k` steps from the origin (0,0) to a point (x,y), the sum of the coordinates `x+y` has the same parity as `k`. Consequently, two points on a walk, `p_i` and `p_j`, can only be adjacent if the number of steps between them, `|i-j|`, is an odd number. This helps in identifying possible traps.\n\n### Acquiring the Answer Step-by-Step\n\n*   **a(0):** A 0-step walk is just the starting point itself. There is only **1** such walk.\n    *   `a(0) = 1`\n\n*   **a(1):** From the origin (0,0), we can take one step in 4 possible directions: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All are valid.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):** For each of the 4 initial steps, the second step cannot reverse the first one. This leaves 3 possible directions for the second step.\n    *   `a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):** We extend the 12 2-step walks. For any 2-step walk (e.g., (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0) or (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)), the endpoint is not adjacent to the origin. Thus, no new traps are formed. Each of the 12 walks has 3 valid, non-reversing extensions.\n    *   `a(3) = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n*   **a(4):** We extend the 36 3-step walks. Here, traps become possible. An endpoint `p_3` can be adjacent to the origin `p_0` (since `3-0=3` is odd).\n    *   **Walks without traps:** Most 3-step walks do not end next to the origin. They have 3 valid extensions.\n    *   **Walks with traps:** Some 3-step walks form a shape like (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1). The endpoint `p_3=(0,1)` is adjacent to the origin `p_0=(0,0)`. There are 8 such walks (a C-shape or U-shape, which can be rotated and reflected).\n    *   For these 8 \"trapped\" walks, the endpoint has two neighbors already on the path (`p_2` and `p_0`), leaving only `4 - 2 = 2` possible extensions.\n    *   The remaining `36 - 8 = 28` walks are not trapped and have `4 - 1 = 3` extensions.\n    *   `a(4) = (8 * 2) + (28 * 3) = 16 + 84 = 100`\n\n*   **a(5):** We extend the 100 4-step walks. The endpoint `p_4` can form a trap if it is adjacent to a previous point `p_k` where `4-k` is odd. The only possibility is `k=1`.\n    *   We need to count the number of 4-step walks where the endpoint `p_4` is adjacent to `p_1`.\n    *   There are two shapes for such walks: a \"U-turn\" on a 2x1 rectangle (e.g., (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(2,1)->(1,1)), and a \"U-turn\" on a 2x2 square (e.g., (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(2,0)).\n    *   A careful count shows there are 8 of each shape, for a total of 16 such walks.\n    *   These 16 walks have only 2 extensions. The other `100 - 16 = 84` walks have 3 extensions.\n    *   `a(5) = (16 * 2) + (84 * 3) = 32 + 252 = 284`\n\n*   **a(6) to a(10):**\n    This method of counting trap configurations becomes exceedingly complex for each subsequent step. There is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). The values are known from large-scale computer enumerations. Following the established sequence:\n    *   `a(6) = 780`\n    *   `a(7) = 2,172`\n    *   `a(8) = 5,916`\n    *   `a(9) = 16,268`\n    *   `a(10) = 44,100`\n\nThe final answer is the known value for a(10).\n\n<<<44100>>>"
