    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of `X = C^(15)`, where `C` is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n### Step 1: Relate the Néron-Severi group of X to the Jacobian of C\n\nLet `C` be a smooth projective curve of genus `g` over the complex numbers. Let `C^(d)` be its d-th symmetric power, which is the space of effective divisors of degree `d` on `C`. `X` is the variety `C^(15)` with `g=3`. The Néron-Severi group `NS(X)` is the group of line bundles on `X` modulo algebraic equivalence, and its rank `ρ(X)` is the Picard number of `X`.\n\nLet `J(C)` be the Jacobian of `C`, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g`. There is a standard result in the theory of algebraic curves that relates the Picard group of `C^(d)` to the Picard group of `J(C)`.\n\n**Theorem (Kempf, Kleiman-Laksov):** For `d ≥ 2g - 1`, the map `u_d^*: Pic(J(C)) → Pic(C^(d))` induced by the Abel-Jacobi map `u_d: C^(d) → J(C)`, combined with a certain natural line bundle on `C^(d)`, gives an isomorphism:\n`Pic(C^(d)) ≅ Pic(J(C)) ⊕ Z`\n\nThis isomorphism respects the subgroups of line bundles algebraically equivalent to zero (`Pic^0`). Therefore, it induces an isomorphism on the Néron-Severi groups:\n`NS(C^(d)) ≅ NS(J(C)) ⊕ Z`\n\nTaking the ranks of these finitely generated abelian groups, we get a formula for the Picard numbers:\n`ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** We must check if this theorem applies to our case.\nHere, `g = 3` and `d = 15`. The condition is `d ≥ 2g - 1`.\n`15 ≥ 2(3) - 1 = 5`.\nThe condition holds, so we can use the formula: `ρ(X) = ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`.\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for `ρ(J(C))` where `C` is a curve of genus 3.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the range of the Picard number of J(C)\n\n`J(C)` is an abelian variety of dimension `g=3`. The Picard number `ρ(J(C))` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^(1,1)(J(C))`. For an abelian variety of dimension `g`, we have `h^(1,1) = g^2`.\nSo, `1 ≤ ρ(J(C)) ≤ h^(1,1)(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9`.\nThe rank is at least 1 because `J(C)` is projective and the class of any ample divisor (like the principal polarization) is non-trivial in `NS(J(C))`. We now need to check if the bounds 1 and 9 are attained for some genus 3 curves.\n\n### Step 3: Find the smallest possible rank of NS(J(C))\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs for a \"very general\" curve `C`. A very general curve in the moduli space `M_3` of genus 3 curves has the property that its Jacobian `J(C)` is a simple abelian variety with the smallest possible endomorphism ring, `End(J(C)) = Z`.\n\nFor such an abelian variety, the Néron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` is generated by the class of the principal polarization `[Θ]`. This is a consequence of the Hodge conjecture for very general abelian varieties.\nThus, `NS(J(C)) ≅ Z`, and its rank is `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The existence of such curves is a standard fact in the theory of moduli of abelian varieties. The locus of curves whose Jacobians have endomorphisms other than integers is a proper analytic subvariety of the moduli space `M_3`.\n\nSo, the minimum possible value is `ρ_min(J(C)) = 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Find the largest possible rank of NS(J(C))\n\nThe largest possible rank `ρ(J(C)) = 9` is achieved when `J(C)` has the maximal number of independent algebraic 2-cycles, which saturates the bound `h^(1,1)(J(C))`. This phenomenon is associated with abelian varieties with complex multiplication (CM).\n\nWe need to see if there exists a genus 3 curve `C` such that `ρ(J(C)) = 9`. This occurs if `J(C)` is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves with complex multiplication.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** An isogeny `φ: A → B` between abelian varieties induces an injective map `φ^*: NS(B) → NS(A)` with a finite cokernel. This implies that the ranks are equal: `ρ(A) = ρ(B)`. So, if `J(C)` is isogenous to an abelian variety `A`, we can compute `ρ(A)` instead of `ρ(J(C))`.\n\nConsider the abelian variety `A = E^3 = E × E × E`, where `E` is an elliptic curve. The Picard number of a product of abelian varieties `A_1 × ... × A_n` is given by `ρ(∏ A_i) = ∑_i ρ(A_i) + ∑_{i<j} rank Hom(A_i, A_j)`.\nFor `A = E^3`, this becomes:\n`ρ(E^3) = 3 ρ(E) + 3 rank Hom(E, E) = 3 ρ(E) + 3 rank End(E)`\n\nFor any elliptic curve `E`, `NS(E)` is generated by the class of a point, so `ρ(E) = 1`. Thus:\n`ρ(E^3) = 3(1) + 3 rank End(E) = 3 + 3 rank End(E)`\n\nTo maximize this value, we must choose an elliptic curve `E` with the largest possible endomorphism ring rank. This occurs when `E` has Complex Multiplication (CM), in which case `End(E)` is an order in an imaginary quadratic field, and `rank_Z End(E) = 2`.\n\nFor a CM elliptic curve `E`, `ρ(E^3) = 3 + 3(2) = 9`.\n\n**Careful Point 4:** We must confirm that there exists a genus 3 curve `C` whose Jacobian is isogenous to `E^3` for some CM elliptic curve `E`. A well-known example is the Fermat quartic curve:\n`C: x^4 + y^4 = 1`\nThis is a curve of genus `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`. Its Jacobian, `J(C)`, is isogenous to `E^3`, where `E` is the elliptic curve `y^2 = x^3 - x`, which has CM by the ring of Gaussian integers `Z[i]`.\n\nTherefore, for the Fermat quartic curve, `ρ(J(C)) = ρ(E^3) = 9`. This shows that the maximum possible value is attained.\nSo, the maximum possible value is `ρ_max(J(C)) = 9`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nNow we can compute the smallest and largest possible ranks for `ρ(X) = ρ(C^(15))`.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:**\n    `ρ_min(X) = ρ_min(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Largest Rank:**\n    `ρ_max(X) = ρ_max(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
