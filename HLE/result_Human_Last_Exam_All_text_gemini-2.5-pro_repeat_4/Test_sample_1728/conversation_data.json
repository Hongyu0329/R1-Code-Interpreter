    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of the given graph \\( G \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of the \"sum of graphs\"\nThe term \"sum of graphs\" can have multiple meanings in graph theory. The most standard and common interpretation is the **graph join**, often denoted by the `+` symbol. Let's analyze the problem using this definition.\n\n*   **Graph Join (\\(H_1 + H_2\\))**: Given two graphs \\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\) with disjoint vertex sets, their join \\(H_1 + H_2\\) is formed by taking the union of their vertex and edge sets, and then adding all possible edges between any vertex of \\(H_1\\) and any vertex of \\(H_2\\).\n*   **The Graph G**: In this problem, \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\). Let these cycles be \\(C_n^1\\), \\(C_n^2\\), and \\(C_n^3\\). Assuming the \"sum\" is the join, we have \\(G = C_n^1 + C_n^2 + C_n^3\\). The vertex sets of the three cycles are considered disjoint.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the chromatic number of a graph join\nA fundamental property of the chromatic number relates to the join operation. For any two graphs \\(H_1\\) and \\(H_2\\), the chromatic number of their join is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\n\\(\\chi(H_1 + H_2) = \\chi(H_1) + \\chi(H_2)\\)\n\nThis property extends to the join of multiple graphs. For our graph \\(G\\), this means:\n\\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n^1 + C_n^2 + C_n^3) = \\chi(C_n^1) + \\chi(C_n^2) + \\chi(C_n^3)\\)\n\nSince all three graphs are cycles of the same length \\(n\\), their chromatic numbers are identical. Let's denote \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) as the chromatic number of a cycle of length \\(n\\). The formula simplifies to:\n\\(\\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n)\\)\n\n### Step 3: Determine the chromatic number of a cycle (\\(C_n\\))\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph \\(C_n\\) depends on the parity of its length \\(n\\). We must have \\(n \\ge 3\\) for a cycle to exist.\n\n*   **Case A: \\(n\\) is even** (\\(n \\ge 4\\))\n    An even cycle is a bipartite graph. This means its vertices can be colored with just two colors. Therefore, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\) for even \\(n\\).\n\n*   **Case B: \\(n\\) is odd** (\\(n \\ge 3\\))\n    An odd cycle is not a bipartite graph. If you try to color it by alternating two colors, the last vertex will be adjacent to vertices of both colors, requiring a third color. Therefore, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\) for odd \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the maximal chromatic number of G\nThe question asks for the **maximal** chromatic number of \\(G\\). This means we need to find the maximum value that \\(\\chi(G)\\) can take, considering all possible values of \\(n \\ge 3\\). We can calculate \\(\\chi(G)\\) for the two cases from Step 3.\n\n*   **If \\(n\\) is even**:\n    \\(\\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\).\n\n*   **If \\(n\\) is odd**:\n    \\(\\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9\\).\n\nComparing the two possible values for \\(\\chi(G)\\), the maximum is 9. This maximum value is achieved whenever \\(n\\) is an odd integer (\\(n \\ge 3\\)).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Ambiguity of \"Sum\"**: The most critical point is the interpretation of \"sum\". The graph join is the standard definition, and its properties lead to a clean and direct solution. An alternative interpretation, like the union of cycles on the same vertex set, leads to a more complex problem with a different answer (which can be shown to be 7). Given the typical context of such problems, the join operation is the most likely intended meaning.\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle**: Correctly recalling that \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) is 2 for even \\(n\\) and 3 for odd \\(n\\) is essential.\n3.  **Maximization over n**: The question asks for the single maximal value. This requires evaluating the result for different types of \\(n\\) and selecting the largest one.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis using the standard definition of graph sum (join), the maximal chromatic number is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
