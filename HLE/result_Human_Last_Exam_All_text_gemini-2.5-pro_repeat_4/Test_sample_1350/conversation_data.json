    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks to identify a specific character within William Morris's novel *The House of the Wolfings*. The criteria for this character are:\n1.  They must have visited a Roman city or have direct knowledge of Roman life.\n2.  They must describe Roman religious practices or foundation myths.\n3.  This description must be recognizable to the reader as the story of Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **The Source Text:** The answer must be found specifically within *The House of the Wolfings*, not other works by Morris or general knowledge about the Goths and Romans.\n2.  **The Character's Perspective:** The character is a Goth, not a Roman. Therefore, their description of the myth will be from an outsider's point of view. They would not use the names \"Romulus\" and \"Remus\" but would describe the key events and figures in a way that corresponds to the myth.\n3.  **Key Elements of the Myth:** To identify the correct passage, we must look for references to core elements of the Romulus and Remus story: twins (or \"two brethren\"), a she-wolf that nurses them, the founding of a great city, and fratricide (one brother killing the other).\n4.  **Character's Backstory:** The character who provides this information would logically be one who has had direct contact with the Roman world. This could be a traveler, a merchant, or, most likely in the context of the book, a former captive or slave.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Characters:** We need to find a character with knowledge of Roman ways. The central conflict in the book is between the Goths (the Wolfings) and the invading Roman legions. While many characters fight the Romans, only a few have deep, firsthand knowledge of their culture.\n\n2.  **Focus on the Most Likely Candidate:** There is one prominent character whose backstory makes him the definitive expert on the Romans within the tribe: **Otter**. Otter was captured as a boy and spent many years as a thrall (slave) in the Roman Empire before escaping and returning to his people. Because of this, he is often called upon to provide intelligence about Roman customs, tactics, and beliefs.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Scene:** In Chapter IV, titled \"The Old Thrall of the Romans tells a Tale,\" the Wolfings are gathered in their great hall, and Otter is asked to speak about the nature of the Romans they are about to fight.\n\n4.  **Analyze Otter's Description:** In his speech, Otter describes the origin of the Romans to explain their warlike and merciless nature. He tells the assembly that the Romans' \"first father\" was one of **two brethren**. He explicitly states that these brethren were not nursed by a human mother but were \"suckled by a **She-wolf**.\" He goes on to recount how one of these brothers slew the other in a quarrel over the founding of their great city. He refers to the Romans as the \"Wolf-suckled kindred.\"\n\n5.  **Confirm the Connection to Romulus and Remus:**\n    *   \"Two brethren\" = The twins, Romulus and Remus.\n    *   \"Suckled by a She-wolf\" = The iconic image of the myth where the abandoned twins are nursed by a she-wolf.\n    *   One brother slaying the other = Romulus killing Remus.\n    *   The founding of a great city = The legend is the foundation myth of Rome.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Otter's tale perfectly matches the key elements of the Romulus and Remus myth, viewed through the lens of a Gothic tribesman. Therefore, Otter is the character who visited a Roman city (as a thrall) and described their religious/foundation myth in a way readers recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
