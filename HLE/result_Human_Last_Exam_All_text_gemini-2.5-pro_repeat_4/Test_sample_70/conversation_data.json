    "Answering this question requires applying concepts from linear algebra to the visual representation of national flags. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Flag Description:** The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red field. The cross is off-center, shifted towards the hoist side. It consists of two colors: red and white.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** We can imagine the flag as a grid of pixels, which forms a matrix. Each color corresponds to a numerical value. Let's assign the value `r` to red and `w` to white.\n3.  **Maximizing the Rank:** The question states we must choose values for the colors to maximize the rank. The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). For a flag with `k` colors, the rank can be at most `k`. Since the Danish flag has 2 colors, its maximum possible rank is 2.\n4.  **Calculating the Rank:** Let's see if rank 2 is achievable. We need to find at least two rows (or columns) that are linearly independent.\n    *   Consider a row that falls entirely on the horizontal bar of the white cross. This row vector will be `v1 = [w, w, w, ..., w]`.\n    *   Consider a row that passes through the red field above or below the horizontal bar. This row will intersect the vertical part of the white cross. This row vector will be `v2 = [r, r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r]`.\n    *   For these two vectors to be linearly independent, one cannot be a scalar multiple of the other. Let's assume `v2 = c * v1` for some scalar `c`.\n        *   This would mean `[r, r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r] = c * [w, w, ..., w] = [c*w, c*w, ..., c*w]`.\n        *   This requires `r = c*w` and `w = c*w`.\n        *   If we choose a non-zero value for `w` (e.g., `w=1`), the second equation gives `c=1`. Substituting this into the first equation gives `r = w`.\n        *   However, red and white are distinct colors, so we must assign them different numerical values (`r â‰  w`). This leads to a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, the vectors `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent. Since we found two linearly independent rows, and the maximum possible rank is 2, the rank of the Danish flag is exactly 2.\n\n### Step 2: Identify African Flags with Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for flags of African nations that also have a maximal rank of 2. We can categorize flags based on their design:\n\n1.  **Flags with Rank 1:** These are flags whose color patterns are arranged in a way that all rows (or columns) are linearly dependent. The most common examples are flags with simple horizontal or vertical stripes.\n    *   **Examples:** Nigeria (Green-White-Green vertical stripes) or Gabon (Green-Yellow-Blue horizontal stripes). In these flags, every row (for vertical stripes) or column (for horizontal stripes) is a combination of constant color vectors, which are all scalar multiples of the vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. Thus, they only span a one-dimensional space. Their rank is 1.\n\n2.  **Flags with Rank > 1:** These are flags with more complex geometries, such as crosses, central emblems, triangles, or diagonal bands, which create linearly independent row/column patterns. We need to find those whose maximal rank is exactly 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of African Flags\n\nWe will now analyze the flags of African nations to find those with a rank of 2.\n\n**A) Flags with 2 Colors and Complex Geometry:**\nA flag with 2 colors and a design more complex than simple stripes will have a rank of 2. The logic is identical to that of the Danish flag: the complex geometry will create at least two different row/column patterns that are linearly independent.\n*   **Morocco:** Red field with a green pentagram. Has \"all-red\" rows and \"red-and-green\" rows. These are linearly independent. **Rank = 2.**\n*   **Somalia:** Blue field with a white star. Has \"all-blue\" rows and \"blue-and-white\" rows. These are linearly independent. **Rank = 2.**\n*   **Tunisia:** Red field with a central white disk containing red symbols. Has \"all-red\" rows and \"red-and-white\" rows. These are linearly independent. **Rank = 2.**\n\n**B) Flags with More Than 2 Colors but a Rank of 2:**\nSome flags have three or more colors, but their geometric arrangement creates linear dependencies that limit their maximal rank to 2.\n*   **Madagascar:** Three colors (White, Red, Green). It has a vertical white stripe and two horizontal stripes (red over green).\n    *   The columns are of two types: `c1 = [w, w, ..., w]^T` (in the white part) and `c2 = [r, ..., r, g, ..., g]^T` (in the red/green part).\n    *   The entire column space is spanned by these two linearly independent vectors. Therefore, the **Rank = 2.**\n*   **Burundi:** Three colors (Red, Green, White). A white saltire (diagonal cross) divides the field into red and green areas, with a white circle in the center.\n    *   A row through the top green area, a row through the central white horizontal bar, and a row through the bottom red area are linearly dependent (`v_green + v_red = k * v_white`). The space is spanned by any two of these. Therefore, the **Rank = 2.**\n*   **Senegal:** Three colors (Green, Yellow, Red). It has three vertical stripes, but the central yellow stripe contains a green star.\n    *   The column space is spanned by the \"all-green\" column vector, the \"all-red\" column vector, and the \"yellow-and-green\" column vector. The \"all-green\" and \"all-red\" vectors are just multiples of an all-1s vector `u`. The column space is `span(u, c_yellow_and_green)`. This is a two-dimensional space. **Rank = 2.**\n*   **Niger:** Three colors (Orange, White, Green). It has three horizontal stripes, but the central white stripe contains an orange circle.\n    *   By the same logic as Senegal (but analyzing rows instead of columns), the row space is spanned by the all-1s vector `u` and the \"white-and-orange\" row vector. **Rank = 2.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (Rank 2) are those with complex geometries that result in exactly two linearly independent row or column patterns. Our analysis identifies the following countries:\n\n*   **Morocco**\n*   **Somalia**\n*   **Tunisia**\n*   **Madagascar**\n*   **Burundi**\n*   **Senegal**\n*   **Niger**\n\n<<<Burundi, Madagascar, Morocco, Niger, Senegal, Somalia, Tunisia>>>"
