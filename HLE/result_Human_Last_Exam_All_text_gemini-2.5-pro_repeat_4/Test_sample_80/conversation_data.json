    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and the Goal**\n\n*   The board is a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n*   The pieces are bishops.\n*   The bishops can only be placed on the **edge squares**.\n*   The condition is that no bishop can attack another (i.e., no two bishops can share a diagonal).\n*   The objective is to place the **maximum possible number** of bishops under these rules.\n*   The final question asks for the number of **empty edge squares**, not the number of bishops placed.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\n\nThe edge squares are all the squares in the first and last rows (rank 1 and rank 8) and the first and last columns (file 'a' and file 'h').\n*   Number of squares in Row 1 = 8\n*   Number of squares in Row 8 = 8\n*   Number of squares in File 'a' (excluding the already counted corners a1 and a8) = 6\n*   Number of squares in File 'h' (excluding the already counted corners h1 and h8) = 6\n*   **Total number of edge squares** = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = **28**.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a Strategy to Maximize the Number of Bishops**\n\nTo place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we should try to place them as densely as possible. A powerful strategy is to fill an entire edge first and then see what spaces are left.\n\n*   Let's place bishops on all squares of a single edge, for example, the top row (rank 8). This gives us **8 bishops** on squares a8, b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8, and h8. Since they are all on the same row, none of them can attack each other, so this is a valid starting placement.\n\n**Step 4: Determine which Other Edge Squares are Attacked**\n\nNow, we need to figure out which of the remaining 20 edge squares (on rows 1, file 'a', and file 'h') are attacked by the 8 bishops we just placed on row 8.\n\n*   **Attacks on the opposite edge (Row 1):** A bishop at (file, 8) can attack a square at (file', 1) only if the distance between them is the same horizontally and vertically. The vertical distance is |8-1|=7.\n    *   The bishop on **a8** (file 1) attacks **h1** (file 8), since |1-8|=7.\n    *   The bishop on **h8** (file 8) attacks **a1** (file 1), since |8-1|=7.\n    *   No other bishops on row 8 can attack any squares on row 1. So, 2 squares on row 1 are attacked.\n\n*   **Attacks on the side edges (File 'a' and File 'h'):**\n    *   The bishop on **b8** attacks **a7**.\n    *   The bishop on **c8** attacks **a6**.\n    *   The bishop on **d8** attacks **a5**.\n    *   The bishop on **e8** attacks **a4**.\n    *   The bishop on **f8** attacks **a3**.\n    *   The bishop on **g8** attacks **a2**.\n    *   This covers all 6 interior squares on file 'a'.\n    *   Similarly, for file 'h': the bishops from **b8** to **g8** attack all the interior squares from **h2** to **h7**.\n\n*   **Summary of attacked squares:** The 8 bishops on row 8 attack the squares a1, h1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, and h7. That's a total of 2 + 6 + 6 = 14 other edge squares.\n\n**Step 5: Place More Bishops on the Unoccupied, Safe Squares**\n\nWe started with 28 edge squares. We placed 8 bishops on row 8. We found that 14 other edge squares are now attacked.\n\n*   The squares on row 1 that are **not** occupied and **not** attacked are: b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1. There are **6** such squares.\n*   Can we place bishops on all 6 of these squares? Yes. Since they are all on the same row, they do not attack each other. Furthermore, they do not attack the bishops on row 8 (as only the corner squares a1/h1 and a8/h8 can interact diagonally).\n*   So, we can add 6 more bishops.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Maximum Number of Bishops and the Final Answer**\n\n*   Maximum number of bishops = 8 (on row 8) + 6 (on row 1) = **14**.\n*   This is a known maximum for non-attacking bishops on an 8x8 board, and this specific arrangement shows it's possible to achieve it using only edge squares.\n\n*   The question asks for the number of edge squares that **lack bishops**.\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Number of bishops placed = 14\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total Squares - Placed Bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n*   Total edge squares: 28\n*   Maximum placed bishops: 14\n*   Edge squares lacking bishops: 28 - 14 = 14\n\n<<<14>>>"
