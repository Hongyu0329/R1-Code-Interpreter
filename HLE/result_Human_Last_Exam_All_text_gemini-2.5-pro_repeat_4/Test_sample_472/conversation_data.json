    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n**1. Syllabification and Natural Vowel Lengths**\nFirst, we break the line into syllables and identify the natural length of each vowel.\n*   `et`: one syllable.\n*   `ti-bi`: two syllables, both with short `i`.\n*   `be-ne`: two syllables, both with short `e`.\n*   `es-se`: two syllables, both with short `e`.\n*   `so-li`: two syllables. `o` is long, `i` is short.\n*   `quom`: one syllable.\n*   `si-bi`: two syllables, both with short `i`.\n*   `sit`: one syllable, short `i`.\n*   `ma-le`: two syllables, both with short vowels.\n\n**2. Determining Syllable Length by Position**\nA syllable is long \"by position\" if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or a double consonant (x, z). These consonants can be within the same word or at the start of the next.\n\n*   `et`: The vowel `e` is followed by `t`. The next word, `tibi`, starts with `t`. So, the syllable `et` is followed by two consonants (`t` + `t`) and is **Long (L)**.\n*   `ti`: The vowel `i` is followed by a single consonant `b`. **Short (S)**.\n*   `bi`: The vowel `i` is followed by a single consonant `b` from the next word. **Short (S)**.\n*   `be`: The vowel `e` is followed by a single consonant `n`. **Short (S)**.\n*   `ne`: The vowel `e` is followed by a single consonant `s` from the next word. **Short (S)**.\n*   `es-` (from `esse`): The vowel `e` is followed by the double consonant `ss`. **Long (L)**.\n*   `-se` (from `esse`): The vowel `e` is followed by a single consonant `s` from the next word. **Short (S)**.\n*   `so-` (from `soli`): This syllable contains a naturally long vowel `ō`. **Long (L)**.\n*   `-li` (from `soli`): The vowel `i` is followed by `qu` (a single consonant sound) from the next word. **Short (S)**.\n*   `quom`: The vowel `o` is followed by `m`. The next word, `sibi`, starts with `s`. So, the syllable `quom` is followed by two consonants (`m` + `s`) and is **Long (L)**.\n*   `si`: The vowel `i` is followed by a single consonant `b`. **Short (S)**.\n*   `bi`: The vowel `i` is followed by a single consonant `s` from the next word. **Short (S)**.\n*   `sit`: The vowel `i` is followed by `t`. The next word, `male`, starts with `m`. So, the syllable `sit` is followed by two consonants (`t` + `m`) and is **Long (L)**.\n*   `ma`: The vowel `a` is followed by a single consonant `l`. **Short (S)**.\n*   `le`: The final syllable of the line. It is short by nature and treated as **Short (S)** in the final foot.\n\n**3. Assembling the Full Pattern**\nThe sequence of long and short syllables is:\nL S S S S L S L S L S S L S S\n\n**4. Grouping into Feet (Iambic Senarius)**\nThe line is an iambic senarius, which consists of six feet. The basic foot is an iamb (S L), but substitutions are very common in the playwright Plautus. We will group the syllables into six valid feet.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti bi` -> **L S S** (Dactyl). A valid substitution for an iamb in the first foot.\n*   **Foot 2:** `be ne es-` -> **S S L** (Anapest). A valid substitution for an iamb.\n*   **Foot 3:** `-se so-` -> **S L** (Iamb). The basic foot of the meter.\n*   **Foot 4:** `-li quom` -> **S L** (Iamb). The basic foot of the meter.\n*   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` -> **S S L** (Anapest). A valid substitution for an iamb.\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma le` -> **S S** (Pyrrhic). A valid substitution for the final iamb, as the last syllable of the line is \"anceps\" (can be long or short).\n\nThis scansion fits the rules of Plautine meter perfectly.\n\nFinal Answer Construction:\nWe will now write out the L/S pattern for each foot, separated by a space.\nFoot 1: L S S\nFoot 2: S S L\nFoot 3: S L\nFoot 4: S L\nFoot 5: S S L\nFoot 6: S S\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L S L S S L S S>>>"
