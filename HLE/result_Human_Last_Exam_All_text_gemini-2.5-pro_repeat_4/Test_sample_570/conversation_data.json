    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane.\nLet `L` be the set of all lines with equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\nThe condition is that `K` must have a non-empty intersection with every line in `L`.\nWe want to find the minimum possible area of `K`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Condition on the Convex Domain\nA line `l` with equation `n · x = c` (where `n` is a normal vector and `x=(x,y)`) intersects a convex set `K` if and only if the values of `n · x` for `x` in `K` span across `c`. That is:\n`inf_{x ∈ K} (n · x) ≤ c ≤ sup_{x ∈ K} (n · x)`\n\nLet `h_K(n) = sup_{x ∈ K} (n · x)` be the support function of `K`. The infimum can be expressed as `inf_{x ∈ K} (n · x) = -sup_{x ∈ K} (-n · x) = -h_K(-n)`.\n\nFor a line `px + qy = 1`, we have `n = (p, q)` and `c = 1`. The condition is:\n`-h_K(-p, -q) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(p, q)`\n\nThis must hold for all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`.\nLet `v = (p, q)`. The condition is `-h_K(-v) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(v)`.\n\nNow, if `(p, q)` are coprime, then `(-p, -q)` are also coprime. So we must also satisfy the condition for the line `(-p)x + (-q)y = 1`, which is `-h_K(p, q) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(-p, -q)`.\n\nCombining the conditions for `v=(p,q)` and `-v=(-p,-q)`:\nFrom `h_K(v) ≥ 1` and `-h_K(v) ≤ 1` (i.e., `h_K(v) ≥ -1`), we get `h_K(v) ≥ 1`.\nFrom `h_K(-v) ≥ 1` and `-h_K(-v) ≤ 1` (i.e., `h_K(-v) ≥ -1`), we get `h_K(-v) ≥ 1`.\n\nSo, for any convex domain `K` satisfying the problem's conditions, its support function must satisfy `h_K(v) ≥ 1` and `h_K(-v) ≥ 1` for every primitive integer vector `v = (p, q)`.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Candidate Domain and an Upper Bound for the Area\nLet's test a simple shape. Consider the square `S` defined by `|x| ≤ 1, |y| ≤ 1`. This is the square with vertices at `(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,1)`. Its area is 4.\nThe range of `px + qy` for `(x,y)` in this square is `[-|p|-|q|, |p|+|q|]`. For a line `px+qy=1` to intersect `S`, we need `-|p|-|q| ≤ 1 ≤ |p|+|q|`. Since `p,q` are coprime, they are not both zero, so `|p|+|q| ≥ 1`. This condition holds. So the square `S` works. The minimal area is at most 4.\n\nLet's try a smaller candidate. Consider the diamond shape `D` defined by `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`. This is the convex hull of the points `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. Its area is `(1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\nLet's check if `D` intersects every line `px+qy=1`. The range of `px+qy` over the vertices of `D` is `[min(p, q, -p, -q), max(p, q, -p, -q)]`. This range is `[-max(|p|,|q|), max(|p|,|q|)]`.\nFor the line to intersect `D`, we need `-max(|p|,|q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|,|q|)`. This is equivalent to `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1`. Since `p,q` are coprime, they cannot both be zero, so this condition holds.\nThus, the diamond `D` with area 2 is a valid convex domain. This tells us the minimal area is at most 2.\n\n### Step 4: Establishing a Lower Bound for the Area\nTo prove that 2 is the minimal area, we must show that any valid convex domain `K` must have an area of at least 2.\n\n1.  Consider the following four lines from the set `L`:\n    *   `x = 1` (p=1, q=0)\n    *   `x = -1` (p=-1, q=0)\n    *   `y = 1` (p=0, q=1)\n    *   `y = -1` (p=0, q=-1)\n    All these pairs `(p,q)` are coprime.\n\n2.  The convex domain `K` must intersect each of these four lines. This means there must exist points `z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4` in `K` such that:\n    *   `z_1` is on the line `x = 1`.\n    *   `z_2` is on the line `x = -1`.\n    *   `z_3` is on the line `y = 1`.\n    *   `z_4` is on the line `y = -1`.\n\n3.  Since `K` is a convex set, it must contain the convex hull of any set of points within it. Therefore, `K` must contain the convex hull of these four points: `conv({z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4})`.\n\n4.  This implies that the area of `K` is at least the area of `conv({z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4})`.\n    `Area(K) ≥ Area(conv({z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4}))`.\n\n5.  The four lines `x=±1, y=±1` form a square, let's call it `Q`, defined by `[-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`. The area of `Q` is `2 × 2 = 4`. The four points `z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4` all lie on the boundary of this square `Q`.\n\n6.  There is a known geometric theorem: The minimum area of the convex hull of four points, one on each side of a square, is half the area of the square. This minimum is achieved when the points are the midpoints of the sides of the square.\n\n7.  The midpoints of the sides of the square `Q` are `(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)`. The convex hull of these four points is the diamond `D` we considered earlier, which has an area of 2.\n\n8.  Therefore, for any choice of `z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4` on the sides of the square `Q`, the area of their convex hull is at least 2.\n    `Area(conv({z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4})) ≥ 2`.\n\n9.  Combining the points, we have `Area(K) ≥ Area(conv({z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4})) ≥ 2`.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nWe have shown two things:\n1.  There exists a convex domain, the diamond `|x|+|y| ≤ 1`, which satisfies the condition and has an area of 2.\n2.  Any convex domain that satisfies the condition must have an area of at least 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area of such a convex domain is exactly 2."
