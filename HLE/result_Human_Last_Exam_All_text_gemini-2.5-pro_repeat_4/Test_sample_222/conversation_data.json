    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Define the target sequence and its DFT\nLet the new 8-point sequence be denoted by `y(n)`.\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\nThis sequence can be formally defined by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n*   `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3` (the even-indexed terms of `y` are from `x`)\n*   `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3` (the odd-indexed terms of `y` are from `h`)\n\nThe question asks for the **4-point DFT** of this **8-point sequence** `y(n)`. When the DFT length `M` is smaller than the sequence length `N`, the standard interpretation is to compute the DFT of a time-aliased version of the sequence.\n\nLet `z(n)` be the 4-point time-aliased sequence derived from the 8-point sequence `y(n)`. It is defined as:\n`z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nA key property of the DFT states that the `M`-point DFT of a time-aliased sequence `z(n)` (obtained from an `N`-point sequence `y(n)` where `N` is a multiple of `M`) is equal to the decimated (downsampled) version of the `N`-point DFT of `y(n)`. In our case, `N=8` and `M=4`.\n\nLet `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)` and `Z(k)` be the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`. The property gives us:\n`Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the 8-point DFT Y(k) to the given 4-point DFTs X(k) and H(k)\nThe 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is defined as:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)` where `W_N = e^(-j*2*π/N)`\n\nWe can split the summation into even and odd indices of `n`:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0 to 3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nSubstitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_8^k * W_8^(2mk)`\n\nUsing the property `W_8^2 = W_4`, the equation becomes:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{m=0 to 3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * Σ_{m=0 to 3} h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n\nThe summations are the definitions of the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`. So, we get:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\nThis formula allows us to compute `Y(k)` using the given `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the required values of Y(k)\nWe need to find `Z(k) = Y(2k)`, which means we need to calculate `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Remember the inputs: `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]` and `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n*   We only need `X(0)`, `X(2)`, `H(0)`, and `H(2)`.\n*   We need the twiddle factors: `W_8^0`, `W_8^2`, `W_8^4`, `W_8^6`.\n    *   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2*π*2/8) = e^(-j*π/2) = -j`\n    *   `W_8^4 = e^(-j*2*π*4/8) = e^(-j*π) = -1`\n    *   `W_8^6 = e^(-j*2*π*6/8) = e^(-j*3*π/2) = j`\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n*   **For k=0 (to find Z(0)):**\n    `Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0 mod 4) + W_8^0 * H(0 mod 4)`\n    `Z(0) = X(0) + 1 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k=1 (to find Z(1)):**\n    `Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2 mod 4) + W_8^2 * H(2 mod 4)`\n    `Z(1) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For k=2 (to find Z(2)):**\n    `Z(2) = Y(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4)`\n    `Z(2) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k=3 (to find Z(3)):**\n    `Z(3) = Y(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4)`\n    `Z(3) = X(2) + (j) * H(2) = -1 + (j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nThe resulting 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is composed of the four values calculated above.\n`Z(k) = {Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)}`\n\n`Z(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
