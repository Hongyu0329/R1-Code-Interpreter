The analytical solution for the density profile is given by the function:
$$ \frac{\rho(x)}{\rho_0} = 1 + \sqrt{\frac{e^{4x/(3L)}}{e^{4x/(3L)}+3}} $$
where $\rho_0$ is the ambient density and $L = \frac{\kappa}{\rho_0 M c_0 C_v}$ is the ambient conductive length scale. The origin $x=0$ is defined as the point where $\rho = 1.5 \rho_0$.
