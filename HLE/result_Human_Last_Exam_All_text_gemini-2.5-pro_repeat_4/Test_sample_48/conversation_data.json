    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of states in the minimal deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) for the given language.\n\n**1. Understand the Regular Expression**\n\nThe language $L$ is defined by the regular expression:\n$L = ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*$\n\nLet's simplify this by defining sub-expressions:\n*   Let $X = (b | c)$. This represents any single character that is not 'a'. $X^*$ is any string without 'a'.\n*   Let $Y = (a | bc | cb | bbb)$. This is a set of allowed substrings. $Y^*$ is any sequence of these substrings.\n*   Let $Z = (ba | bba | ca)$. This is another set of allowed substrings.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the regular expression for $L$ as:\n$L = (X^* a Y^* Z)^* X^* a Y^*$\n\nLet's define two main building blocks:\n*   $B_1 = X^* a Y^* = (b|c)^* a (a|bc|cb|bbb)^*$\n*   $B_2 = Z = (ba|bba|ca)$\n\nSo, the language can be expressed as $L = (B_1 B_2)^* B_1$.\n\nThis structure tells us that any string in $L$ is formed by concatenating zero or more blocks of type $B_1 B_2$, followed by one block of type $B_1$. This implies that any string in $L$ is also in $B_1$ or ends with a suffix that is in $B_1$.\n\n**2. Constructing the DFA by Analyzing Prefixes**\n\nWe will build the states of the DFA by considering the equivalence classes of prefixes. A state in the DFA corresponds to a set of prefixes that require the same set of suffixes to form a valid string in $L$.\n\n*   **State $S_0$ (Initial State):**\n    This state represents prefixes that have not yet seen the character 'a', or prefixes that have just completed a $B_1 B_2$ block. These are prefixes of the form $(b|c)^*$ or strings in $(B_1 B_2)^k$ for $k \\ge 1$. From this state, we need to see a full string from $L$ to have an accepting word. For a prefix $w$ in this class, $wz \\in L$ if and only if $z \\in L$. The empty string $\\epsilon$ is in this class. Since $\\epsilon \\notin L$, this state is non-accepting.\n    *   If we read 'b' or 'c', we still haven't seen an 'a', so we remain in state $S_0$.\n    *   If we read 'a', we have now seen the 'a' that starts a $B_1$ block. We transition to a new state, $S_1$.\n\n*   **State $S_1$ (Accepting State):**\n    This state represents prefixes that are themselves valid strings in $L$. These are prefixes of the form $(B_1 B_2)^* B_1$. Since these strings are in $L$, $S_1$ is an accepting state.\n    *   On 'a': The string 'a' is in $Y$. If we have a string $w \\in L$ and we append 'a', the new string $wa$ is also in $L$ (since $wa \\in (B_1 B_2)^* B_1 a \\subseteq (B_1 B_2)^* B_1 Y^* = (B_1 B_2)^* B_1$). So, we stay in $S_1$.\n    *   On 'b': We have a prefix ending in 'b'. This could be the start of 'bc' or 'bbb' from $Y$, or 'ba' or 'bba' from $Z$. This requires a new state to remember we've seen a 'b'. Let's call it $S_b$.\n    *   On 'c': This could be the start of 'cb' from $Y$ or 'ca' from $Z$. This requires a new state, $S_c$.\n\n*   **State $S_b$ (Intermediate State):**\n    This state represents prefixes from $S_1$ followed by 'b' (e.g., 'ab'). This state is non-accepting.\n    *   On 'a': The suffix 'ba' is in $Z$. The prefix is now of the form $(B_1 B_2)^* B_1 (ba)$, which is a complete $B_1 B_2$ block. Such a prefix behaves like $\\epsilon$, so we transition to $S_0$.\n    *   On 'c': The suffix 'bc' is in $Y$. The prefix is now of the form $(B_1 B_2)^* B_1 (bc)$, which is a string in $L$. So, we transition to the accepting state $S_1$.\n    *   On 'b': We now have a suffix 'bb'. This could be the start of 'bbb' from $Y$ or 'bba' from $Z$. We need another state to remember 'bb', let's call it $S_{bb}$.\n\n*   **State $S_{bb}$ (Intermediate State):**\n    This state represents prefixes from $S_1$ followed by 'bb' (e.g., 'abb'). This state is non-accepting.\n    *   On 'a': The suffix 'bba' is in $Z$. The prefix is now a complete $B_1 B_2$ block. Transition to $S_0$.\n    *   On 'b': The suffix 'bbb' is in $Y$. The prefix is now in $L$. Transition to $S_1$.\n    *   On 'c': The sequence 'bbc' is not a prefix of any valid continuation from $Y$ or $Z$. This leads to a dead state. Let's call it $S_d$.\n\n*   **State $S_c$ (Intermediate State):**\n    This state represents prefixes from $S_1$ followed by 'c' (e.g., 'ac'). This state is non-accepting.\n    *   On 'a': The suffix 'ca' is in $Z$. The prefix is now a complete $B_1 B_2$ block. Transition to $S_0$.\n    *   On 'b': The suffix 'cb' is in $Y$. The prefix is now in $L$. Transition to $S_1$.\n    *   On 'c': The sequence 'cc' is not a prefix of any valid continuation. Transition to the dead state $S_d$.\n\n*   **State $S_d$ (Dead/Trap State):**\n    This state represents prefixes that can never be completed to a string in $L$. Any transition from this state will loop back to itself. This state is non-accepting.\n\n**3. Minimizing the DFA**\n\nWe have constructed a DFA with 6 states: $\\{S_0, S_1, S_b, S_{bb}, S_c, S_d\\}$. Now we must check if this is minimal by identifying and merging equivalent states. Two states are equivalent if they have the same accepting status and for every input symbol, they transition to equivalent states.\n\n*   **Accepting vs. Non-Accepting:** $S_1$ is the only accepting state, so it's in its own class.\n    Partition 0: $\\{S_1\\}, \\{S_0, S_b, S_{bb}, S_c, S_d\\}$\n\n*   **Distinguishing Non-Accepting States:** We use the table-filling algorithm.\n    *   $S_d$ is a dead state, while all others can reach the accepting state $S_1$. So $S_d$ is distinct.\n    *   $S_0$ is distinct from $S_b, S_{bb}, S_c$ because on input 'a', $S_0$ transitions to $S_1$ while the others transition to $S_0$.\n    *   $S_b$ is distinct from $S_{bb}$ and $S_c$ because on 'c', $S_b \\to S_1$ (accepting), while $S_{bb} \\to S_d$ and $S_c \\to S_d$ (non-accepting).\n\n*   **Comparing $S_{bb}$ and $S_c$:**\n    Let's examine their transitions:\n    *   On 'a': $S_{bb} \\to S_0$ and $S_c \\to S_0$. (Same destination state)\n    *   On 'b': $S_{bb} \\to S_1$ and $S_c \\to S_1$. (Same destination state)\n    *   On 'c': $S_{bb} \\to S_d$ and $S_c \\to S_d$. (Same destination state)\n\nSince for every input symbol, $S_{bb}$ and $S_c$ transition to the same state, they are indistinguishable and therefore equivalent. We can merge them into a single state.\n\n**4. Final Count of States**\n\nAfter merging the equivalent states $S_{bb}$ and $S_c$, the minimal DFA has the following states:\n1.  $[S_0]$: The initial state.\n2.  $[S_1]$: The single accepting state.\n3.  $[S_b]$: The state reached from $[S_1]$ on input 'b'.\n4.  $[S_{bb}, S_c]$: The merged state.\n5.  $[S_d]$: The dead state.\n\nThus, the minimal DFA that recognizes the language $L$ has 5 states.\n\nFinal check of the states:\n1.  **q0 (Initial):** Represents prefixes in $(b|c)^*$.\n2.  **q1 (Accepting):** Represents prefixes that are valid words in L.\n3.  **q_b:** Represents prefixes like $w \\cdot b$ where $w \\in L$.\n4.  **q_m:** Represents prefixes like $w \\cdot c$ or $w \\cdot bb$ where $w \\in L$. (This is the merged state).\n5.  **q_d (Dead):** Represents prefixes that cannot be extended to a valid word.\n\nThe total number of states is 5.\n\nFinal Answer is 5. This corresponds to choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
