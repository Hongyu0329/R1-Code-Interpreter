    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and its orientation.**\nThe tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Each face is an equilateral triangle. The tank is standing on one of its faces, which means this face is horizontal and serves as the base.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"half-filled with water\" condition.**\nWhen a container is half-filled, the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the container. The surface of the water in a stationary tank under gravity is always a horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the concept of symmetry.**\nA regular icosahedron is a highly symmetric object. One of its key properties is that it has a center of symmetry (also known as a point of inversion). This means that for any point on the icosahedron, there is a corresponding point directly opposite it, at the same distance from the center.\nA plane that passes through this center of symmetry will divide the icosahedron into two identical pieces with equal volume.\nSince the water fills half the volume, the water's surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the symmetry of the water surface shape.**\nThe water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by cutting the icosahedron with this central, horizontal plane.\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** Because the icosahedron is standing on a triangular face, the vertical axis passing through the center of the base and the center of the opposite top face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Since the water surface is perpendicular to this axis, the shape of the surface must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Central Symmetry:** As established in Step 3, the plane of the water surface contains the icosahedron's center of symmetry. Therefore, the resulting 2D shape must also be centrally symmetric (i.e., it has 2-fold rotational symmetry).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the symmetries to identify the shape.**\nA two-dimensional shape that possesses both 3-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry about the same point must have 6-fold rotational symmetry. The simplest polygon with 6-fold rotational symmetry is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Step 6: Confirm the shape by considering the structure.**\n*   The plane cutting through the center of the icosahedron (parallel to a face) will intersect some of the icosahedron's 30 edges.\n*   A detailed analysis of the icosahedron's vertex and edge arrangement reveals that this specific central plane intersects exactly 6 edges.\n*   Due to the overall symmetry of the icosahedron, these 6 intersection points are equidistant from the center and are separated by equal angles of 60 degrees.\n*   These 6 points form the vertices of a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen the icosahedron tank is half-filled, the water level is at the central plane of the icosahedron. The cross-section of the icosahedron at this plane is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
