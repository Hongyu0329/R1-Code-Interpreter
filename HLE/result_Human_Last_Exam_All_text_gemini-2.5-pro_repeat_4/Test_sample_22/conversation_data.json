    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Phenotype:** A measurable characteristic of an individual, such as height, blood pressure, or risk for a disease.\n    *   **SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism):** A common type of genetic variation at a single position in a DNA sequence.\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter that quantifies the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of all the SNPs being considered (e.g., all common SNPs across the genome). It represents the *theoretical upper limit* of predictive power if we knew the true effect size of every single SNP. It is the ceiling of what is possible to predict using a linear model of these SNPs.\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is calculated by summing up an individual's genotypes at many SNPs, with each SNP's contribution weighted by its estimated effect size.\n    *   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is measured by how well the PGS predicts the phenotype in a *new, independent sample* (one not used to create the PGS). It is typically quantified as the R-squared (R²), which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS.\n\n2.  **Compare the Concepts:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical maximum. It assumes we have perfect information about the true, underlying effect of every SNP on the phenotype.\n    *   **PGS Predictive Ability (R²_PGS):** This is a practical, realized measure. The weights used in a PGS are not the true, unknown effect sizes. Instead, they are *estimates* derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n3.  **Identify Sources of Discrepancy:**\n    The core of the question lies in why the practical measure (R²_PGS) would differ from the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP). The primary reason is that the effect size estimates from a GWAS are imperfect. This imperfection arises from several factors:\n    *   **Finite Sample Size:** GWAS are conducted on a finite number of individuals. This means there is statistical noise (sampling error) in the estimation of each SNP's effect size. A PGS built with these noisy estimates will be less accurate than one built with the true (but unknown) effects.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** Genes are inherited in blocks, so SNPs that are physically close to each other are often correlated. This makes it difficult for a GWAS to pinpoint the exact causal SNP and its precise effect, as the signal is spread across multiple correlated SNPs.\n    *   **Statistical Methods:** The methods used to select SNPs and assign weights for a PGS (e.g., clumping and thresholding, or more advanced Bayesian methods) are approximations and cannot perfectly reconstruct the true genetic architecture.\n    *   **Population Differences:** The GWAS sample (where weights are learned) and the prediction sample (where the PGS is tested) may have subtle differences in genetic ancestry, LD patterns, or environmental factors, which can reduce the PGS's accuracy.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Relationship:**\n    Because the PGS is built using *estimated* and therefore imperfect weights from a finite GWAS, its predictive ability will be an attenuated version of the theoretical maximum. The `h²_SNP` represents the \"ceiling\" of what's possible, and the `R²_PGS` represents how close we can get to that ceiling with current data and methods. As GWAS sample sizes increase, the effect size estimates become more accurate, and the `R²_PGS` gets closer to `h²_SNP`, but it cannot exceed it. For any real-world scenario with a finite GWAS sample, there will be estimation error, ensuring that the predictive ability of the PGS is lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Necessarily lower\":** This is a strong claim. The only hypothetical scenario where `R²_PGS` could equal `h²_SNP` is if the discovery GWAS had an infinite sample size, leading to perfect estimation of the true effect sizes. Since this is impossible in practice, the predictive ability is, for all practical purposes, necessarily lower.\n*   **SNP Heritability vs. Total Heritability:** It's important to remember that `h²_SNP` is itself a lower bound for the total narrow-sense heritability (`h²`), as it only includes variance from common SNPs, not rare variants or other structural variations. The question correctly compares the PGS to its proper ceiling, `h²_SNP`.\n*   **Out-of-Sample Prediction:** The concept of \"predictive ability\" correctly implies testing the PGS in an independent sample to avoid inflation from overfitting.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe statement is correct. The SNP heritability defines the theoretical maximum variance that can be explained by the considered SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical predictor built from estimated data (from a GWAS) which is inherently noisy due to finite sample sizes. This estimation error means the predictive performance of the PGS will always be less than the theoretical maximum.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
