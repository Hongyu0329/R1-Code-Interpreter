    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key historical figure and context.**\nThe question asks about the Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his first major defeat in what is now Vietnam. This points to the period of the Ming dynasty's occupation of Vietnam (known as Jiaozhi province, 1407–1427) and the subsequent Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mu Sheng's campaigns in Vietnam.**\nMu Sheng was involved in two major phases of Ming military action in Vietnam:\n1.  **The initial invasion (1406-1407):** Mu Sheng, along with Zhang Fu, led the successful invasion that overthrew the Hồ dynasty. This campaign was a victory for the Ming, so his first major defeat did not occur here.\n2.  **The Lam Sơn Uprising (1418-1427):** After the initial conquest, Mu Sheng was tasked with governing and suppressing local resistance. The most significant resistance was the Lam Sơn uprising. Mu Sheng led several campaigns against the Lam Sơn forces, but it was during the final, decisive phase of this war that he suffered a catastrophic defeat.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the specific battle constituting his \"first major defeat\".**\nWhile Mu Sheng had engaged Lê Lợi's forces before with mixed results, his most significant and undeniable defeat occurred in 1427. In that year, the Ming Emperor sent two large relief armies to crush the rebellion once and for all.\n*   One army, led by Liu Sheng, advanced from Guangxi.\n*   The second army, led by Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan down the Clear River (Sông Lô).\n\nThe Vietnamese plan was to destroy Liu Sheng's army first. They did so spectacularly at the Battle of Chi Lăng (in modern Lạng Sơn Province) in October 1427, where Liu Sheng was killed and his 100,000-man army was annihilated.\n\n**Step 4: Locate Mu Sheng's defeat.**\nUpon hearing the news of Liu Sheng's complete destruction, Mu Sheng's army, which had advanced along the Clear River, lost its morale and began to retreat. The Vietnamese forces, led by commanders Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, seized the opportunity to attack Mu Sheng's retreating army. They were ambushed and routed at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá. Mu Sheng barely escaped with his life, abandoning all his supplies, equipment, and heavy weaponry. This was a decisive military disaster and qualifies as his first truly major defeat.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the modern province corresponding to the battlefield.**\nThe battles of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá took place along the Clear River (Sông Lô). The section of the river where Mu Sheng's army was advancing and subsequently defeated is located in the territory of modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province**. This province lies northwest of Hanoi and was on the direct invasion route from Yunnan.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy tracing Mu Sheng's military career in Vietnam, we can identify his first major defeat as the rout of his army at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in 1427. Historical and geographical sources place these battle sites within the modern-day borders of Tuyên Quang Province.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
