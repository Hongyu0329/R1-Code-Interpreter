No, it is not true. The second postulate is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first postulate alone. The deduction requires the additional assumption that Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism are fundamental laws of physics that must be invariant, which was not a given. The second postulate is an independent, empirical statement that provides the crucial physical content needed to select the correct transformation laws (Lorentz transformations) for spacetime.
