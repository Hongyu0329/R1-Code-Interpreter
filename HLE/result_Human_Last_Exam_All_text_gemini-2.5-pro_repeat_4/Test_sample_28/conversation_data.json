    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Definitions\n\n*   **Domain (X):** A set of points of size $|X| = T$.\n*   **Hypothesis Class ($H_{z-ones}$):** This is a set of functions (hypotheses) $h: X \\to \\{0,1\\}$. The defining constraint for any function $h$ in this class is that the number of points mapped to 1 is exactly $z$. That is, $|\\{x \\in X : h(x)=1\\}| = z$.\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   $T$: The size of the domain, a positive integer.\n    *   $z$: A positive integer representing the exact number of points to be labeled '1'.\n*   **Goal:** Determine the VC dimension of $H_{z-ones}$ in terms of $z$ and $T$.\n*   **VC Dimension:** The VC dimension of a hypothesis class is the size of the largest set of points that the class can *shatter*. A set of points $S$ is shattered if the class can produce every possible binary labeling on $S$.\n\nFor the class $H_{z-ones}$ to be non-empty, we must be able to choose $z$ points from $T$ points, which requires $z \\le T$. If $z > T$, the class is empty, and its VC dimension is -1. We will assume $1 \\le z \\le T$ for the main analysis.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's find the size $m$ of the largest set $S \\subseteq X$ that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$.\n\n#### Part A: Proving a Lower Bound (VCdim $\\ge m'$)\n\nWe want to find the largest value $m'$ for which we can guarantee that any set $S$ of size $m'$ can be shattered.\n1.  Let $S$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$ with $|S| = m$.\n2.  To shatter $S$, we must be able to realize any of the $2^m$ possible labelings on $S$.\n3.  Consider an arbitrary labeling on $S$. Let this labeling assign '1' to $k$ points in $S$ and '0' to the other $m-k$ points. The number $k$ can be any integer from $0$ (all '0's) to $m$ (all '1's).\n4.  To realize this labeling with a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, we must satisfy the class constraint: the total number of points labeled '1' in the entire domain $X$ must be exactly $z$.\n5.  Since we have already assigned '1' to $k$ points within $S$, we must assign '1' to exactly $z-k$ points in the complement set $X \\setminus S$.\n6.  The number of points available in the complement set is $|X \\setminus S| = T - m$.\n7.  For a valid hypothesis to exist, we must be able to choose $z-k$ points from the $T-m$ available points in $X \\setminus S$. This is only possible if the number of points to choose is between 0 and the number of available points. That is:\n    $0 \\le z-k \\le T-m$\n8.  This condition must hold for **every possible labeling** of $S$, which means it must hold for **all possible values of $k$ from $0$ to $m$**. We check the condition at the extreme values of $k$:\n    *   **Check $k_{max}=m$:** The labeling is \"all ones\". We need $0 \\le z-m$. This simplifies to $m \\le z$.\n    *   **Check $k_{min}=0$:** The labeling is \"all zeros\". We need $z-0 \\le T-m$. This simplifies to $m \\le T-z$.\n9.  For a set of size $m$ to be shattered, both conditions must hold: $m \\le z$ and $m \\le T-z$. This is equivalent to $m \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n10. This shows that any set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least this value.\n    **VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\ge \\min(z, T-z)$**\n\n#### Part B: Proving an Upper Bound (VCdim $\\le m'$)\n\nNow we need to show that no set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z) + 1$ can be shattered. We can do this by finding just one labeling that cannot be generated by any hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$.\n1.  Let $S$ be a set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z) + 1$.\n2.  We consider two cases, depending on which term determines the minimum.\n\n    *   **Case 1: $z \\le T-z$**\n        In this case, $\\min(z, T-z) = z$. So we test a set $S$ of size $m = z+1$.\n        Consider the labeling that assigns '1' to all $z+1$ points in $S$.\n        Any hypothesis $h$ that could generate this labeling must have $h(x)=1$ for all $x \\in S$. The total count of points labeled '1' by $h$ would be at least $z+1$.\n        However, every hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ must label exactly $z$ points as '1'. Since $z+1 > z$, no such hypothesis exists.\n        Therefore, this \"all ones\" labeling cannot be generated, and a set of size $z+1$ cannot be shattered.\n        This means VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le z = \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: $z > T-z$**\n        In this case, $\\min(z, T-z) = T-z$. So we test a set $S$ of size $m = (T-z)+1$.\n        Consider the labeling that assigns '0' to all $m$ points in $S$.\n        A hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ generating this must have $h(x)=0$ for all $x \\in S$. To satisfy the class constraint, $h$ must label exactly $z$ points as '1'. All these points must come from the complement set $X \\setminus S$.\n        The number of points available in the complement set is $|X \\setminus S| = T - |S| = T - ((T-z)+1) = z-1$.\n        We need to choose $z$ points to label '1' from a set of only $z-1$ available points, which is impossible.\n        Therefore, this \"all zeros\" labeling cannot be generated, and a set of size $(T-z)+1$ cannot be shattered.\n        This means VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le T-z = \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n3.  In both cases, we have shown that no set of size $\\min(z, T-z) + 1$ can be shattered. This establishes the upper bound.\n    **VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le \\min(z, T-z)$**\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower bound from Part A and the upper bound from Part B, we have:\n$\\min(z, T-z) \\le$ VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nThis forces the equality:\nVCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $= \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nThis result is valid for $1 \\le z \\le T$.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
