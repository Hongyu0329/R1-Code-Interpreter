    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Two Formulations of LASSO**\n\nThe question presents two common ways to formulate the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression problem.\n\n*   **Formulation 1 (Constraint Form):**\n    (Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ) = argmin ‚àë·µ¢(y·µ¢ ‚Äî Œ± ‚Äî ‚àë‚±ºŒ≤‚±ºx·µ¢‚±º)¬≤\n    subject to ‚àë‚±º |ùõΩ‚±º| ‚â§ ùë°\n    This formulation minimizes the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) under the constraint that the L1 norm of the coefficient vector `Œ≤` does not exceed a budget `t`.\n\n*   **Formulation 2 (Penalized or Lagrangian Form):**\n    (Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ) = argmin {‚àë·µ¢(y·µ¢ ‚Äî Œ± ‚Äî ‚àë‚±ºŒ≤‚±ºx·µ¢‚±º)¬≤ + Œª‚àë‚±º |ùõΩ‚±º|}\n    This formulation minimizes a composite objective function, which is a sum of the RSS and a penalty term. The penalty term is the L1 norm of the coefficient vector `Œ≤` scaled by a tuning parameter `Œª`.\n\nThe question asks if it is **always strictly true** that these two formulations are equivalent. Equivalence here means that for any solution found using one formulation (for a specific `t` or `Œª`), there exists a corresponding parameter in the other formulation (`Œª` or `t`) that yields the exact same set of solutions. The notation `(Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ) = argmin...` refers to the set of all solutions that minimize the expression.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Relationship and Potential for Equivalence**\n\nThe relationship between constrained optimization and its Lagrangian (penalized) form is a fundamental concept in convex optimization. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions establish a formal link. In principle, for convex problems like this one, the two formulations are very closely related. For every `t`, there's a corresponding `Œª`, and vice-versa, that leads to the same solution.\n\nHowever, the question uses the strong phrase \"always strictly true\". This requires us to look for edge cases or conditions where the equivalence might fail. The key issue arises when the solution to the optimization problem is not unique.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the Case of Non-Unique Solutions**\n\nThe RSS term, `‚àë·µ¢(y·µ¢ ‚Äî Œ± ‚Äî ‚àë‚±ºŒ≤‚±ºx·µ¢‚±º)¬≤`, is a convex function, but it is not *strictly* convex if the design matrix `X` is not of full column rank. This happens, for example, when the number of predictors `p` is greater than the number of observations `n` (`p > n`), or when there is perfect multicollinearity among predictors.\n\nLet's analyze what happens in such a case:\n1.  **OLS Solution (`Œª=0`):** When `Œª=0`, Formulation 2 reduces to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). If the OLS solution is not unique, there is a whole set (an affine subspace) of coefficient vectors `Œ≤` that give the same minimum RSS. Let's call this set `S_OLS`.\n2.  **LASSO Solution:** The LASSO solution (for both formulations) must be one of these OLS solutions that also satisfies the constraint or minimizes the penalty.\n3.  **The Breakdown of Equivalence:** Let's construct a simple example. Suppose the set of OLS solutions is the line `Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 1`. This is the solution set for Formulation 2 with `Œª=0`. Now, consider Formulation 1. If we set `t = 1`, the constraint is `|Œ≤‚ÇÅ| + |Œ≤‚ÇÇ| ‚â§ 1`. The solutions to this constrained problem must minimize the RSS (i.e., lie on the line `Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 1`) while also satisfying the constraint. The points that satisfy both conditions are the line segment connecting `(1, 0)` and `(0, 1)`.\n4.  **Comparison:** The solution set for Formulation 2 with `Œª=0` is the entire line `Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 1`. The solution set for Formulation 1 with the corresponding `t=1` is only a segment of that line. Since the solution sets are not identical, the equivalence is not \"strictly true\".\n\nTherefore, the statement in the question is **False**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\nNow we must choose the best explanation from the given options.\n\n*   **A, C, D:** These options claim the path of coefficients is not continuous or has jumps. This is incorrect. A key property of the LASSO/LARS algorithm is that the coefficient path `ùõΩÃÇ(Œª)` is a continuous (and piecewise-linear) function of `Œª`. So, these options are based on a false premise.\n*   **B, H, I:** These options mention the continuity of the path but use flawed reasoning. For example, B and H incorrectly claim the sum of absolute values might not be continuous, which is false since it's a sum of continuous functions. I presents a non-sequitur (\"False because [something that would support it]\").\n*   **F:** This option claims the statement is \"Strictly true\", which we've shown to be false.\n*   **G, J:** These options introduce an irrelevant condition on `Œ±` and `Œ≤`.\n*   **K:** This option claims \"True in general...\". Since the statement is technically false, this is an incorrect starting point.\n*   **E:** \"False in general, but often true in practice\". This is the most accurate description.\n    *   **\"False in general\"**: This is correct. As demonstrated, the strict equivalence breaks down in cases of non-uniqueness.\n    *   **\"but often true in practice\"**: This is also a fair statement. In many well-behaved scenarios (e.g., `p < n` and `X` is full rank), the solutions are unique, and the two formulations are used interchangeably because they produce the same result. The cases where it fails are specific, though important.\n\nBy eliminating all other options based on incorrect premises or flawed logic, option E remains as the best choice. It correctly identifies the statement's truth value and provides a reasonable high-level summary of the situation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
