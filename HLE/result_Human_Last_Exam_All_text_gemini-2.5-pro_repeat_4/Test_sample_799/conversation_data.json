    "This problem asks for the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set contained within the interval [0, 1]. Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set of numbers $A$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are unique, up to the order of summation. Formally, for any elements $a, b, c, d \\in A$, the equation $a+b = c+d$ implies that the set of summands must be the same, i.e., $\\{a, b\\} = \\{c, d\\}$. This means either ($a=c$ and $b=d$) or ($a=d$ and $b=c$).\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(A)$, is a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. It generalizes the standard notion of dimension (0 for points, 1 for lines, etc.) to non-integer values. For any set $A \\subseteq [0, 1]$, its Hausdorff dimension is a number between 0 and 1, i.e., $0 \\le \\dim_H(A) \\le 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the maximum dimension\n\nTo find a lower bound, we need to construct a Sidon set in $[0, 1]$ with a large Hausdorff dimension. A common method to construct such fractal sets is using a Cantor set-like construction.\n\n1.  **General Idea:** We construct a set $C(N, D)$ consisting of numbers in $[0, 1]$ whose base-$N$ expansions only contain digits from a specific set $D \\subset \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$. The Hausdorff dimension of such a set is given by $\\dim_H(C(N,D)) = \\frac{\\log|D|}{\\log N}$.\n\n2.  **Imposing the Sidon Property:** For $C(N, D)$ to be a Sidon set, we need to ensure that if $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in C(N, D)$ satisfy $x_1+x_2 = x_3+x_4$, then $\\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{x_3, x_4\\}$. A straightforward way to ensure this is to choose the digit set $D$ and the base $N$ such that additions in base $N$ do not involve \"carries\".\n    *   Let $x_i = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty d_{i,k} N^{-k}$, where $d_{i,k} \\in D$.\n    *   $x_1+x_2 = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (d_{1,k}+d_{2,k})N^{-k}$.\n    *   If we ensure that the sum of any two digits from $D$ is less than the base $N$ (i.e., $\\max(D)+\\max(D) < N$), then the base-$N$ representation of the sum $x_1+x_2$ has digits $(d_{1,k}+d_{2,k})$.\n    *   In this \"no-carry\" regime, $x_1+x_2=x_3+x_4$ is equivalent to $d_{1,k}+d_{2,k}=d_{3,k}+d_{4,k}$ for all $k$.\n    *   If we also require the digit set $D$ to be a Sidon set of integers, then $d_{1,k}+d_{2,k}=d_{3,k}+d_{4,k}$ implies $\\{d_{1,k},d_{2,k}\\}=\\{d_{3,k},d_{4,k}\\}$, which in turn implies $\\{x_1,x_2\\}=\\{x_3,x_4\\}$.\n\n3.  **Maximizing the Dimension:** Our goal is to maximize $\\dim_H = \\frac{\\log|D|}{\\log N}$ subject to the conditions:\n    a) $D \\subset \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$ is a Sidon set of integers.\n    b) Let $d_{max} = \\max(D)$. We need $2d_{max} < N$.\n\n    From number theory, it is known that it's possible to construct dense Sidon sets. For a large integer $M$, there exists a Sidon set $D \\subset \\{0, 1, \\ldots, M\\}$ with size $|D| \\sim \\sqrt{M}$.\n    Let's use this. Let $|D|=m$. Then we can find such a set with $d_{max} \\approx m^2$.\n    To satisfy condition (b), we must choose $N > 2d_{max} \\approx 2m^2$.\n    The dimension of the resulting Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is:\n    $\\dim_H = \\frac{\\log m}{\\log N} \\approx \\frac{\\log m}{\\log(2m^2)} = \\frac{\\log m}{2\\log m + \\log 2}$.\n    As we let $m \\to \\infty$, this ratio approaches $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n    $\\lim_{m\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\log m}{2\\log m + \\log 2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThis construction shows that we can create Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimensions arbitrarily close to $1/2$. Therefore, the maximum possible dimension must be at least $1/2$.\n\n### Step 3: Establish an upper bound for the maximum dimension\n\nNow we must show that no Sidon set can have a Hausdorff dimension greater than $1/2$. This is a well-known result in the field, and a common proof strategy relies on discretizing the set.\n\n1.  **Discretization:** Let $A \\subset [0,1]$ be a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension $s = \\dim_H(A)$. For a large integer $N$, we can discretize the set $A$ by mapping each point $x \\in A$ to the integer $\\lfloor Nx \\rfloor$. Let's call the resulting set of integers $A_N = \\{ \\lfloor Nx \\rfloor : x \\in A \\}$. $A_N$ is a subset of $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$.\n\n2.  **Relating Dimensions:** The size of the discretized set $|A_N|$ is related to the (box-counting) dimension of $A$. For \"well-behaved\" sets, including those with positive Hausdorff measure, we have $|A_N| \\approx N^s$ for large $N$.\n\n3.  **From Real to Integer Sidon Sets:** If $A$ is a Sidon set, what can we say about $A_N$? Suppose we have $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4 \\in A_N$ such that $n_1+n_2 = n_3+n_4$. Each $n_i$ corresponds to some $x_i \\in A$.\n    From $n_i = \\lfloor Nx_i \\rfloor$, we have $Nx_i - 1 < n_i \\le Nx_i$.\n    Summing these inequalities, we find $|(x_1+x_2) - (x_3+x_4)| < 2/N$.\n    If $A$ is a compact Sidon set, the differences between distinct sums $|(a+b)-(c+d)|$ are bounded away from zero by some value $\\eta > 0$. If we choose $N > 2/\\eta$, the condition $|(x_1+x_2) - (x_3+x_4)| < 2/N$ implies that $x_1+x_2 = x_3+x_4$. Since $A$ is a Sidon set, this means $\\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{x_3, x_4\\}$. This in turn implies $\\{n_1, n_2\\} = \\{n_3, n_4\\}$, provided $N$ is large enough to prevent different pairs from being mapped to the same integers.\n    This shows that $A_N$ is essentially a Sidon set of integers. A more rigorous argument confirms this intuition.\n\n4.  **Bounding the Size:** A classical result in additive number theory states that the maximum size of a Sidon set contained in $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$ is at most $\\sqrt{N} + O(N^{1/4})$. So, we must have $|A_N| \\lesssim \\sqrt{N}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Combining the results from discretization and number theory, we get:\n    $N^s \\approx |A_N| \\lesssim \\sqrt{N} = N^{1/2}$.\n    This inequality $N^s \\lesssim N^{1/2}$ can only hold for all large $N$ if $s \\le 1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ cannot exceed $1/2$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the lower bound from Step 2 and the upper bound from Step 3, we conclude that the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in $[0, 1]$ is exactly $1/2$.\n\n>>>1/2"
