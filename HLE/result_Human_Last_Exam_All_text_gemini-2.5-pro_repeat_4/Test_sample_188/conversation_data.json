    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the maximum possible length (in characters) of the secret message hidden in the Ching book.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Encoding Medium (The Ching):**\n    *   The Ching contains a sequence of symbols.\n    *   Total number of symbols in the Ching = 9999.\n    *   The symbols are of the \"yinyang-wuxing\" type.\n    *   \"yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n    *   \"wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (e.g., wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of unique, distinct symbols that can be formed is `2 * 5 = 10`. This is the size of our \"encoding alphabet\".\n\n3.  **Analyze the Message Alphabet (from The Shu):**\n    *   The secret message is written using characters found in the Shu.\n    *   The Shu is written using a specific set of 120 common Chinese characters.\n    *   This means the \"message alphabet\" consists of 120 unique characters.\n\n4.  **Determine the Encoding Scheme:**\n    *   We need to figure out how many symbols from the Ching are required to represent one character of the secret message. This is a classic information theory problem.\n    *   Let `k` be the number of symbols from the Ching used to encode a single character.\n    *   Since there are 10 unique types of symbols in the Ching, `k` symbols can form `10^k` unique combinations or \"codewords\".\n    *   To represent all 120 characters of the message alphabet, the number of available combinations must be greater than or equal to the number of characters.\n    *   So, we must find the smallest integer `k` that satisfies the inequality: `10^k >= 120`.\n    *   Let's test values for `k`:\n        *   If `k = 1`, `10^1 = 10`. This is less than 120, so 1 symbol is not enough.\n        *   If `k = 2`, `10^2 = 100`. This is still less than 120, so 2 symbols are not enough.\n        *   If `k = 3`, `10^3 = 1000`. This is greater than 120, so 3 symbols are sufficient to uniquely represent each of the 120 characters.\n    *   Therefore, each character of the secret message is encoded by a sequence of **3** symbols from the Ching.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:**\n    *   The Ching provides a total of 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each character of the message requires 3 of these symbols.\n    *   The maximum length of the message is the total number of available symbols divided by the number of symbols needed per character.\n    *   Maximum Message Length = `Total Symbols in Ching` / `Symbols per Character`\n    *   Maximum Message Length = `9999 / 3 = 3333`.\n\n### Careful Points and Irrelevant Information\n\n*   **Size of the Shu book (~3000 characters):** This is irrelevant. The crucial piece of information is the size of the *alphabet* used, which is 120 characters, not the total length of the book.\n*   **Computer Vision Recognition Time (12 ms):** This information relates to the process of reading the Shu book, not decoding the message in the Ching. It is irrelevant to calculating the message's length.\n*   **Computation Time (10 ns for integers, 30 ns for floats):** This is technical \"noise\" and has no bearing on the combinatorial problem of determining the message length. It is designed to be a distraction.\n*   **Exactness:** The problem states the Ching has *exactly* 9999 symbols. This number is precise and should be used as such. Since 9999 is perfectly divisible by 3, we don't need to worry about any leftover symbols.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe final calculation is straightforward:\nTotal available symbols: 9999\nSymbols required per message character: 3\nMaximum message length = 9999 / 3 = 3333 characters.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
