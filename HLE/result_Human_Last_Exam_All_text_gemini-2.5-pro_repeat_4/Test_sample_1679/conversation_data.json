    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Entity:** A \"Luxor Obelisk\".\n    *   **Event:** Depicted on-screen.\n    *   **Qualification:** In a film that won the Academy Award for \"Best Picture\".\n    *   **Constraint:** The very \"first\" one in chronological order of wins.\n\n2.  **Identify the \"Luxor Obelisk\":**\n    It's crucial to know what and where the Luxor Obelisks are. There are two obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n    *   One remains standing at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n    *   The other, known as the \"Obélisque de Louxor,\" was moved to Paris in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde**.\n    Therefore, the film in question must feature a scene in either Luxor, Egypt (at the temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n\n3.  **Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners:**\n    We must start from the first award ceremony and check the setting of each winning film until we find a match.\n\n    *   **1927/1928 - *Wings***: Set primarily during World War I in France. While it features French locations, it is focused on aerial combat and military encampments, not Parisian landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   **1928/1929 - *The Broadway Melody***: Set in New York City.\n    *   **1929/1930 - *All Quiet on the Western Front***: Set during World War I from the German perspective.\n    *   **1930/1931 - *Cimarron***: Set in Oklahoma, USA.\n    *   **1931/1932 - *Grand Hotel***: Set in Berlin, Germany.\n    *   **1932/1933 - *Cavalcade***: Set in London, UK.\n    *   **1934 - *It Happened One Night***: Set in the USA.\n    *   **1935 - *Mutiny on the Bounty***: Set primarily at sea and on Tahiti.\n    *   **1936 - *The Great Ziegfeld***: Set in New York City.\n    *   **1937 - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This is a strong candidate. The film is a biopic of the famous French writer Émile Zola and is set almost entirely in France, primarily Paris. A key sequence in the film is Zola's grand funeral procession. Historically, the procession passed through major Parisian sites. In the film, wide shots establishing the massive scale of the funeral clearly show the procession at the **Place de la Concorde**, with the Luxor Obelisk visible.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Finding:**\n    Since we are looking for the *first* winner, and we have found a confirmed depiction in the 1937 winner, *The Life of Emile Zola*, we can conclude our search. No earlier Best Picture winner has scenes set in either Luxor or the Place de la Concorde.\n\n5.  **Note Subsequent Winners (for context):**\n    Other later Best Picture winners also depict the Parisian obelisk, including:\n    *   ***An American in Paris*** (1951): The famous final ballet sequence features a stylized Place de la Concorde with the obelisk.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days*** (1956): The journey includes a stop in Paris where landmarks are shown.\n    *   ***Gigi*** (1958): Features many on-location scenes in Paris.\n    However, *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) precedes all of them.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **The existence of two obelisks:** The query could have been satisfied by a film set in Egypt or Paris.\n*   **The meaning of \"depict\":** The obelisk does not need to be a plot point; it simply needs to be visually present on screen. In *The Life of Emile Zola*, it appears in an establishing shot.\n*   **Chronological order is key:** The question is about the \"first\" winner, making the year of the win the most critical sorting factor.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition:\nBy analyzing the Best Picture winners in order, *The Life of Emile Zola*, which won the award for 1937 at the 10th Academy Awards, is the first film to meet the criteria by showing the Luxor Obelisk in Paris's Place de la Concorde.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
