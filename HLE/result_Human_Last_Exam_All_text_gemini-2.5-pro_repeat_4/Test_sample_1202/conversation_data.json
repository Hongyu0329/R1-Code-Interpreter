    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe core of the question is to identify the primary evolutionary mechanism that explains two things happening to a gene after it has been duplicated:\n*   **Retention:** Both copies of the gene are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than one copy being lost. The most common fate of a duplicate gene is to become a non-functional pseudogene and eventually be deleted, so a specific mechanism is needed to explain its retention.\n*   **Divergence:** The two gene copies accumulate differences in their DNA sequence, leading them to have different functions or expression patterns.\n\nThe question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism among the choices provided.\n\n**2. Analyze the Answer Choices:**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"overwritten\" by the sequence of another homologous gene copy. This mechanism leads to **homogenization** (making the genes more similar), which is the opposite of divergence. Therefore, it does not explain the divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one of the duplicate genes accumulates disabling mutations (e.g., stop codons, frameshifts) and becomes non-functional. While this is a very common *fate* for a duplicate gene, it is a mechanism of gene **loss**, not gene **retention**. The question asks for a mechanism that retains both copies.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, after duplication, one copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely **new, beneficial function**. Positive selection then acts to preserve this new gene. This mechanism explains both retention (the original copy is essential, and the new copy provides a new advantage) and divergence (the new copy's sequence changes to support its new function). This is a valid and important mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model), the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (e.g., it was active in two different tissues). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that degrade a different sub-function. For example, copy A loses the ability to function in tissue 1 but retains function in tissue 2, while copy B loses function in tissue 2 but retains it in tissue 1. Now, both copies are required to perform the complete set of the original ancestral functions. This mechanism explains both retention (losing either copy would now be disadvantageous) and divergence (the sequences diverge as they specialize).\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species that fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is a species-level process, not a molecular mechanism that acts on individual genes within a genome.\n\n**3. Compare the Plausible Options (C and D):**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the \"most likely\" one.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** requires a rare event: a mutation that creates a new, beneficial function. Until this happens, the duplicate gene is redundant and at high risk of being lost through pseudogenization.\n*   **Subfunctionalization**, on the other hand, can happen through a more common and passive process. It relies on random, degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations, which occur much more frequently than gain-of-function mutations. By partitioning the ancestral functions, it provides a neutral pathway for preserving both gene copies from being lost. Once preserved, they are free to diverge further.\n\nBecause subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events and provides a ready mechanism to protect the duplicate gene from immediate loss, many evolutionary biologists consider it to be a more frequent or likely pathway for the initial preservation and subsequent retention of duplicate genes than neofunctionalization. It effectively acts as a \"holding station\" that prevents pseudogenization and allows for long-term survival of both copies. For this reason, it is often considered the \"most likely\" mechanism among the choices for explaining the widespread retention of duplicate genes.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nSubfunctionalization provides a robust and common mechanism for preserving duplicate genes by partitioning ancestral functions, relying on frequent degenerative mutations. This makes it a highly likely driver for the retention and divergence of a large number of duplicated genes observed in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
