    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms\n\nThe question asks for the integer $n$ for which any \"tame functor\" $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable, given that $J$ is an upper semilattice.\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** A partially ordered set (poset) $J$ where for any two elements $x, y \\in J$, their least upper bound (or join), denoted $x \\vee y$, exists in $J$. From a category theory perspective, this means $J$, viewed as a category, has products for any pair of objects. A key property of a non-empty upper semilattice is that its Hasse diagram is connected (when viewed as an undirected graph).\n\n*   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(x)$ to each element $x \\in J$ and a linear map $f(x \\to y): f(x) \\to f(y)$ for each relation $x \\le y$ in $J$, respecting composition. The collection of all such functors forms an abelian category, denoted $[J, \\text{Vect}_K]$, which is equivalent to the category of left modules over the incidence algebra $K[J]$.\n\n*   **n-resolvable:** An object $M$ in an abelian category is called $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. That is, there exists an exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective object. The smallest such $n$ is the projective dimension of $M$, denoted $pd(M)$. The question asks for a uniform bound $n$ that works for *all* tame functors on *any* such poset $J$. This is related to the global dimension of the underlying category.\n\n*   **Tame Functor:** This is the most crucial and ambiguous term. \"Tame\" usually describes a representation *type* of an algebra or a poset, not an individual object (functor/module). The tame/wild dichotomy, established by Drozd, classifies representation theories into three types: finite, tame, and wild.\n    *   **Finite type:** Finitely many indecomposable representations.\n    *   **Tame type:** Infinitely many indecomposables, but for each dimension $d$, they can be classified by a finite number of 1-parameter families.\n    *   **Wild type:** The classification problem is as hard as classifying pairs of matrices up to similarity, which is considered unsolvable.\n\nGiven the phrasing, there are two main interpretations for \"tame functor\":\n1.  **Interpretation A:** \"Tame\" refers to the poset $J$. The question is about *any* functor $f$ where the poset $J$ is of tame representation type.\n2.  **Interpretation B:** \"Tame functor\" refers to a specific class of functors, namely those that constitute the \"tame\" part of the representation theory. In the Auslander-Reiten theory of tame algebras, the indecomposable modules are divided into preprojective, preinjective, and **regular** modules. The regular modules are the ones that form the 1-parameter families (tubes), and are thus considered the quintessentially \"tame\" objects.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Interpretation A\n\nUnder this interpretation, we are looking for an upper bound on the projective dimension of any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is any tame upper semilattice. This is equivalent to finding the supremum of the global dimensions of the categories $[J, \\text{Vect}_K]$ over all such $J$.\n\n*   For a finite poset $J$, the global dimension of the category $[J, \\text{Vect}_K]$ (or the incidence algebra $K[J]$) is equal to the length of the longest chain in $J$. Let's denote this by $L(J)$.\n*   So, the question becomes: What is $\\sup \\{L(J) \\mid J \\text{ is a tame upper semilattice}\\}$?\n*   Consider a simple chain poset $C_m = \\{c_1 < c_2 < \\dots < c_m\\}$. The length of the longest chain is $m-1$.\n    *   Is $C_m$ an upper semilattice? Yes, for any $c_i, c_j$, their join is $c_{\\max(i,j)}$.\n    *   Is $C_m$ of tame type? Yes, it is of *finite* representation type for any finite $m$, and finite type is a special case of tame type.\n*   The global dimension of $K[C_m]$ is $m-1$. Since we can choose $m$ to be arbitrarily large, there is no finite upper bound on the global dimension. This means there is no universal integer $n$ for which *every* functor on *any* tame upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable.\n\nThis interpretation leads to a contradiction with the premise of the question that such a finite $n$ exists. Therefore, Interpretation A is likely incorrect.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Interpretation B\n\nThis interpretation assumes \"tame functor\" is a non-standard term for a **regular indecomposable representation**. Let's see where this leads.\n\n*   The question becomes: What is the projective dimension of a regular representation of a tame poset $J$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice?\n*   There is a key theorem in the representation theory of posets, due to Nazarova and Zavadskij. It states:\n    *   **Theorem:** If $P$ is a finite poset of tame representation type, then the projective dimension of any regular representation of $P$ is at most 1. That is, if $M$ is a regular indecomposable module over $K[P]$, then $pd(M) \\le 1$.\n*   This theorem provides a direct answer. If a \"tame functor\" is a regular representation, then it is 1-resolvable. If it is a direct sum of such representations, its projective dimension is also at most 1.\n*   This interpretation resolves the issue found in Step 2. It provides a specific, finite value for $n$.\n*   What is the role of the \"upper semilattice\" condition? It might be a condition to ensure the poset is well-behaved (e.g., connected) for the theory to apply cleanly, or it could be extraneous information, as the theorem holds for all tame posets. The result does not depend on this property.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nInterpretation B is the only one that leads to a coherent answer that matches the format of the question. The ambiguity of the term \"tame functor\" is best resolved by associating it with the technical meaning of regular representations in the context of tame algebras.\n\n*   A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is interpreted as a regular representation of the poset $J$.\n*   According to a theorem by Nazarova and Zavadskij, any regular representation of a poset of tame representation type has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n*   Therefore, any such functor is 1-resolvable.\n\nThe number $n$ is 1."
