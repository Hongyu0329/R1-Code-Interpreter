The final answer is a threshold signature scheme based on the BLS signature scheme. It uses a Pedersen VSS-based Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol for creating key shares. The signing protocol is a single round where each of the $t$ participating signers broadcasts a partial signature $\sigma_i = H(m)^{s_i}$. An aggregator then verifies each partial signature against the signer's public key share, and combines them using Lagrange interpolation to produce the final signature $\sigma = \prod (\sigma_i)^{\lambda_i}$. This design is correct, its signing protocol is more efficient than two rounds, and its security proof provides a tight reduction to the CDH problem in the Random Oracle Model.
