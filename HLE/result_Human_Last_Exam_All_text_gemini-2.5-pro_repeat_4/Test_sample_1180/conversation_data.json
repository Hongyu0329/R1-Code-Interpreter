    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the Curve and its Initial Model:**\n    The curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$. We consider this equation as a model over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The valuation $v$ is normalized by $v(2)=1$.\n\n2.  **Reduction modulo 2:**\n    Reducing the equation modulo 2, we get $z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, which in characteristic 2 is $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0$. The special fiber of this model is a double line $z=1$ in the affine plane $\\mathbb{A}^2_{\\mathbb{F}_2}$. This indicates that the model has bad reduction, and since the special fiber is non-reduced, the reduction is not semistable. The curve $C$ has potentially good or semistable reduction.\n\n3.  **Find a more suitable model:**\n    To analyze the reduction, we perform a change of variables. Let $z = 1+2Y$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    $(1+2Y)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $1 + 4Y + 4Y^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $4Y(Y+1) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n    $2Y(Y+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$\n    Let's rename the variables to $X, Y$. The equation becomes $2Y^2 + 2Y = X^5 + X^3$. This equation defines a new model $\\mathcal{C}'$ of the curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the special fiber of the new model:**\n    The special fiber $\\bar{\\mathcal{C}}'$ of this new model is obtained by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n    $0 \\equiv X^5 + X^3 \\pmod{2}$\n    $0 \\equiv X^3(X^2+1) \\pmod{2}$\n    In characteristic 2, this becomes $X^3(X+1)^2 = 0$.\n    The special fiber is a union of two components in the $(X,Y)$-plane over $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n    -   $C_1$: The line $X=0$, with multiplicity 3.\n    -   $C_2$: The line $X=1$, with multiplicity 2.\n    This model is regular in the affine plane, but its special fiber is still not a normal crossings divisor because the components have multiplicities greater than 1.\n\n5.  **Interpret \"thickness of the double point\":**\n    In the context of stable reduction of curves, a component of the special fiber with multiplicity 2 is often called a \"double fiber\" or a \"double component\". The resolution of such a component in the process of finding the stable model often leads to a chain of projective lines ($\\mathbb{P}^1$). The \"thickness\" of the double component (or \"double point\" in a broader sense) refers to the number of these $\\mathbb{P}^1$s in the chain, minus one. For a chain of length $m+1$, the thickness is $m$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the thickness:**\n    The calculation of the thickness of a double component is a standard procedure in the theory of arithmetic surfaces. For a component of multiplicity 2 in the special fiber over a discrete valuation ring with uniformizer $\\pi$, the local model often takes a form from which the thickness can be computed.\n    Let's analyze the model $\\mathcal{C}': 2Y^2 + 2Y = X^5+X^3$ near the double component $C_2: X=1$.\n    Let $X=1+u$. Substituting this into the equation:\n    $2Y^2+2Y = (1+u)^5 + (1+u)^3$\n    The right hand side can be expanded as a power series in $u$:\n    RHS = $(1+5u+10u^2+...) + (1+3u+3u^2+...) = 2+8u+13u^2+...$\n    So, $2(Y^2+Y) = 2+8u+...$\n    $Y^2+Y = 1+4u+\\frac{13}{2}u^2+...$\n    This equation describes the behavior of the model over the formal neighborhood of the component $X=1$.\n\n    A key insight comes from comparing this to a semistable model. A model is \"more\" semistable if the valuations of its coefficients are smaller. Our equation $2(Y^2+Y) = X^5+X^3$ is \"off\" from being semistable by the factor of 2 on the left hand side. If the equation were $Y(Y+1) = X^5+X^3$, its reduction mod 2 would be $Y(Y+1)=X^3(X+1)^2$, which is a union of 4 lines intersecting.\n    The presence of the factor $2$ on the LHS indicates the source of the non-semistable behavior. The valuation of this factor, $v(2)=1$, measures how \"thick\" the singularity is.\n\n    In more advanced terms, the thickness $m$ of a double component is given by a formula. For $p \\neq 2$, this is typically $m = v(D)-1$, where $D$ is the discriminant of a quadratic equation on the component. For $p=2$, the calculation is more involved. However, for a local equation of the form $\\pi(Y^2+Y) = f(X)$, where $v(\\pi)=1$ and $f(X)$ has integral coefficients, the thickness of the degenerate fiber is often related to the valuation of $\\pi$.\n\n    In our case, the equation $2(Y^2+Y) = X^5+X^3$ can be seen as having the parameter $\\pi=2$ creating the double component structure. The \"thickness\" of the singularity caused by this parameter is its valuation.\n    The thickness of the double point (which corresponds to the component $C_2$ with multiplicity 2) is $v(2)=1$."
