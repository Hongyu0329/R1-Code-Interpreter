    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the man's last name.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** The man is called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the poet Andrei Voznesensky. This points to a historical figure who was an explorer or navigator and was the subject of one of Voznesensky's works. The description is poetic, suggesting someone who brought something new and positive, not just a conqueror.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** Voznesensky also wrote the line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This is a crucial piece of information. It indicates that the man's burial place was lost or unknown for a significant period. He likely died far from home or was buried in a place that was later destroyed or forgotten.\n\n3.  **Connect the clues to Voznesensky's work:** The quotes are from the libretto of the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). Andrei Voznesensky wrote the poetry for this opera. The opera tells the story of a real Russian historical figure.\n\n4.  **Identify the historical figure:** The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764–1807).\n    *   He fits the \"sailor\" description perfectly, as he was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and a diplomat who undertook a famous voyage to Spanish California.\n    *   His story involves a tragic romance, which aligns with the poetic and emotional tone of the descriptions.\n\n5.  **Analyze the third clue and verify it against the figure's life:** The question of his grave's location \"emerged in the late 1980s\".\n    *   Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while returning from his journey. He was buried at the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n    *   During the Soviet era, the cathedral was demolished, and the cemetery was paved over, causing the exact location of his grave to be lost for decades. This explains Voznesensky's line about the missing grave.\n    *   In the late 1980s, fueled by the popularity of the rock opera and the new era of *Glasnost* (openness) in the Soviet Union, there was a surge of interest in finding Rezanov's resting place. Historical and archaeological efforts pinpointed the presumed location of his grave. A memorial was subsequently placed there. This timeline perfectly matches the clue.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll clues point to Nikolai Rezanov, the Russian explorer and subject of Voznesensky's libretto for \"Juno and Avos\". The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
