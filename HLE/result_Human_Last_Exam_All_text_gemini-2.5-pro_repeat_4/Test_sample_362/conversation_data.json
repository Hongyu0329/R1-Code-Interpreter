    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Carbonyl compound:** Pivalaldehyde. The prefix \"pival-\" refers to the pivaloyl group, which contains a tert-butyl group ((CH₃)₃C-) attached to a carbonyl. Since it's an aldehyde, the carbonyl carbon is also bonded to a hydrogen. The structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide.\n        *   \"triphenyl-l5-phosphane\" indicates a triphenylphosphine group, PPh₃.\n        *   \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\" describes the carbon chain attached to the phosphorus. \"Ethylidene\" means a two-carbon group attached by a double bond, =CH-CH₃. The \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" part means a 2-chlorophenyl group is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene moiety.\n        *   Therefore, the structure of the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where the chlorine is at the ortho (2-) position on the phenyl ring.\n\n2.  **Understand the Wittig Reaction:**\n    *   The Wittig reaction is a powerful method to synthesize alkenes. It involves the reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with a phosphorus ylide.\n    *   The core transformation is the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom (C=O) with the carbon group from the ylide (=CR¹R²).\n    *   The overall reaction is: R³R⁴C=O + Ph₃P=CR¹R² → R³R⁴C=CR¹R² + Ph₃P=O (triphenylphosphine oxide).\n\n3.  **Apply the Reaction to the Specific Reactants:**\n    *   We are reacting pivalaldehyde, (CH₃)₃C-CHO, with the ylide, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl).\n    *   The C=O of the pivalaldehyde will be replaced by the =CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl) group from the ylide.\n    *   The two parts that will form the new double bond are:\n        *   From pivalaldehyde: (CH₃)₃C-CH=\n        *   From the ylide: =CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)\n    *   Combining these gives the alkene product with the structure: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl).\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism):**\n    *   The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n    *   **Stabilized ylides** (with electron-withdrawing groups like -C=O, -CN on the ylidic carbon) typically give the E (trans) alkene.\n    *   **Unstabilized ylides** (with electron-donating groups like alkyl groups on the ylidic carbon) typically give the Z (cis) alkene as the major product, especially under salt-free conditions.\n    *   In our ylide, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl), the ylidic carbon (=CH-) is attached to a hydrogen and a -CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl) group. This substituent is an alkyl-type group, not an electron-withdrawing group. Therefore, this is an **unstabilized ylide**.\n    *   The reaction of an unstabilized ylide with an aldehyde is expected to produce the Z-isomer as the major product.\n    *   To assign the Z configuration, we look at the priorities of the groups on each side of the new double bond ((CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-R, where R is -CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)).\n        *   On the left carbon: The tert-butyl group ((CH₃)₃C-) has higher priority than the hydrogen (H).\n        *   On the right carbon: The -CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl) group has higher priority than the hydrogen (H).\n    *   In the Z-isomer, the two high-priority groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n\n5.  **Name the Final Product:**\n    *   The main chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain. Numbering from the end that gives the double bond the lowest number starts from the phenyl side.\n        1-(2-chlorophenyl)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)=CH(4)-C(CH₃)₃(5) gives pent-2-ene.\n    *   The substituents are a 2-chlorophenyl group at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 4.\n    *   The full name, including the stereochemistry, is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\nThe Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane results in the formation of an alkene by replacing the carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde with the alkylidene part of the ylide. The ylide is unstabilized, leading predominantly to the Z-isomer of the alkene. The product is named (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<The product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene."
