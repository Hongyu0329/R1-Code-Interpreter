    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The question asks to identify a specific person whose **lectures** were **cited** by Albert Einstein in his **1905 paper on Brownian motion**. Each of these components—\"lectures,\" \"cited,\" and the specific \"1905 paper\"—is a critical constraint.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper**: The paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers. Its German title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Examine the Paper for Citations**: A careful review of the original 1905 paper reveals that it is famously self-contained and has almost no citations to the work of other scientists. This was characteristic of some of Einstein's major papers from that year, where he built his arguments from fundamental principles.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 1: The Addendum**: The paper does contain a note, an addendum (\"Nachtrag\" in German), which was added in proof after the main body was written. In this note, Einstein acknowledges having recently seen the experimental work of Henry Siedentopf and Richard Zsigmondy, citing their 1904 paper in *Annalen der Physik*.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a formal citation, but it refers to an experimental *paper*, not to *lectures*. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria of the question.\n\n5.  **Careful Point 2: The Meaning of \"Lectures\" and Intellectual Influence**: The most important theoretical foundation for Einstein's paper was the field of statistical mechanics, which was pioneered by **Ludwig Boltzmann**. Boltzmann's seminal work was published in a two-volume book titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" (Lectures on Gas Theory)**. Einstein studied this work intensely and used its principles as the basis for his own work on statistical physics.\n\n6.  **Careful Point 3: Citations in Preceding Papers**: While Einstein did **not** cite Boltzmann in the 1905 Brownian motion paper itself, he explicitly cited Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" in his earlier papers on the foundations of statistical mechanics published in 1902, 1903, and 1904. These earlier papers laid the direct groundwork for the 1905 paper.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The premise of the question is technically flawed because the 1905 paper on Brownian motion contains no citations to anyone's lectures. However, the question almost certainly alludes to the primary intellectual source for the paper. The theoretical framework Einstein used comes directly from Ludwig Boltzmann's work, which was famously published as \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" and which Einstein had cited in his immediately preceding work. Therefore, the person whose lectures formed the undeniable foundation for the paper is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of the intellectual origins and foundation of the paper, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
