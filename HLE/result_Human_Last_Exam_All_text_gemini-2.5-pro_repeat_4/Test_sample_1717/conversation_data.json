    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, based on Terraria's source code mechanics.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:**\n    First, we need the fundamental health value of the Eye of Cthulhu. In Normal Mode with a single player, its health is **2800**. This is the base value upon which all other calculations are built.\n\n2.  **Apply Expert Mode Scaling (Single Player):**\n    In Expert Mode, boss stats are increased. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its health for a single player is set to **3640**. This is a specific value for this boss, representing a 1.3x multiplier on its Normal Mode base health (`2800 * 1.3 = 3640`).\n\n3.  **Apply Multiplayer Health Scaling:**\n    Terraria increases boss health for each player in a world. The formula for this scaling depends on the game mode.\n    *   In Normal Mode, health increases by 35% of the base health for each additional player.\n    *   In Expert Mode, this bonus is increased to **50%** of the *Normal Mode base health* for each player beyond the first.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Per-Player Health Bonus:**\n    The health bonus for each additional player in Expert Mode is 50% of the Normal Mode base health (2800).\n    *   Health Bonus = `2800 * 0.50 = 1400`\n    So, for every player after the first, 1400 health is added to the boss's total.\n\n5.  **Formulate the General Health Equation:**\n    Let `H` be the total health and `N` be the number of players. The formula is:\n    `H(N) = (1-Player Expert Health) + (Health Bonus per Additional Player) * (Number of Additional Players)`\n    `H(N) = 3640 + 1400 * (N - 1)`\n    This can be simplified:\n    `H(N) = 3640 + 1400N - 1400`\n    `H(N) = 2240 + 1400N`\n\n6.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Scenario:**\n    The question asks for the health with an infinite number of players (`N → ∞`). Looking at our formula `H(N) = 2240 + 1400N`, as `N` approaches infinity, the health `H(N)` also approaches infinity.\n    *   `lim (N→∞) (2240 + 1400N) = ∞`\n\n7.  **Consider the \"According to the Source Code\" Constraint:**\n    This is the most critical point. While the mathematical formula yields infinity, the game itself has technical limitations. In the source code of Terraria (written in C#), the variables that store NPC health (`NPC.life` and `NPC.lifeMax`) are **32-bit signed integers** (`int`).\n\n8.  **Identify the Technical Limit:**\n    A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. Any attempt to store a number larger than this will result in an \"integer overflow,\" which would cause unpredictable behavior (like the health wrapping around to a large negative number).\n    The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is `2^31 - 1`.\n    *   Maximum Value = **2,147,483,647**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mathematical formula for health scaling would increase indefinitely with more players. However, the game engine's architecture imposes a hard cap. The health value cannot exceed the maximum value of the data type used to store it. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can have is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
