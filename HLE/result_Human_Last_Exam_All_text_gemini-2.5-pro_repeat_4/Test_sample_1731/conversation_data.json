    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Interpretation of the Question using Large Deviation Theory**\n\nThe question asks for the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a photon gas, using the concepts of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state of a system under given constraints. Large Deviation Theory (LDT) provides a mathematical framework to determine the probability of macroscopic states.\n\n*   A macroscopic state can be described by an empirical distribution (e.g., the fraction of particles at each energy level).\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability of an empirical distribution. It states that the probability of observing an empirical distribution `q` is related to an entropy-like term. For a system of indistinguishable particles like bosons, the relevant \"entropy\" is the Boltzmann entropy for bosons, which counts the number of microscopic arrangements (microstates) corresponding to a given macroscopic configuration (macrostate).\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability of the sample mean of random variables deviating from its expected value. In our context, this relates to the constraint on the mean energy of the system. The system is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature `T`, which means its average energy is fixed.\n\nCombining these ideas, the probability of observing a macrostate described by an occupation number distribution `{n_i}` is governed by a rate function that is equivalent to the Helmholtz free energy, `F = E - TS`. The equilibrium state is the one that minimizes this rate function. The `E` term is related to the Cramer-Chernoff principle (enforcing the energy constraint), and the `-TS` term is related to the Boltzmann-Sanov principle (the entropic contribution to the probability).\n\nTherefore, the problem is to find the distribution `{n_i}` that minimizes the free energy and then use this equilibrium distribution to calculate the system's total mean energy `U` and entropy `S`.\n\n**2. System Properties and Key Formulas**\n\n*   **System**: A gas of photons in a volume `V` at thermal equilibrium at temperature `T`.\n*   **Particles**: Photons are bosons. A key property is that their total number is not conserved, which implies their chemical potential is zero (`μ = 0`).\n*   **Energy and Entropy**: The mean energy `U` and entropy `S` of a boson gas are given by summing over all possible energy states `i` with energy `ε_i` and degeneracy `g_i`:\n    *   Mean Energy: `U = Σ_i n_i ε_i`\n    *   Entropy (for bosons): `S = k_B Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i) ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i ln(n_i) - g_i ln(g_i) ]`\n    where `n_i` is the number of particles in energy level `i`.\n\n**3. Finding the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nTo find the equilibrium values, we minimize the Helmholtz free energy `F = U - TS`. This is equivalent to maximizing `S/k_B - βU` (where `β = 1/(k_B T)`) with respect to the occupation numbers `n_i`.\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to `n_i` and setting it to zero:\n`∂/∂n_i (S/k_B - βU) = 0`\n`∂/∂n_i [ln( (n_i + g_i)! / (n_i! g_i!) ) - β n_i ε_i] = 0`\nUsing Stirling's approximation (`ln(x!) ≈ x ln(x) - x`):\n`∂/∂n_i [ (n_i+g_i)ln(n_i+g_i) - n_i ln(n_i) - β n_i ε_i ] = 0`\n`ln(n_i + g_i) + 1 - ln(n_i) - 1 - βε_i = 0`\n`ln( (n_i + g_i) / n_i ) = βε_i`\n`1 + g_i / n_i = exp(βε_i)`\n`n_i / g_i = 1 / (exp(βε_i) - 1)`\n\nThis is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average occupation number per state (`<n> = n_i/g_i`) for photons (`μ=0`).\n\n**4. Continuous Spectrum and Density of States**\n\nFor photons in a 3D box of volume `V`, the energy levels are quasi-continuous. We replace the sum over states with an integral over energy, using the density of states `g(ε)`. The number of available states for photons (with two polarization states) in the energy interval `[ε, ε + dε]` is:\n`g(ε)dε = (V ε² / (π² ħ³ c³)) dε`\nwhere `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**5. Calculation of Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nThe total mean energy `U` is obtained by integrating the energy of photons over all possible energies:\n`U = ∫₀^∞ ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) dε`\n`U = ∫₀^∞ ε * (1 / (exp(βε) - 1)) * (V ε² / (π² ħ³ c³)) dε`\n`U = (V / (π² ħ³ c³)) ∫₀^∞ (ε³ / (exp(βε) - 1)) dε`\n\nTo solve the integral, we make the substitution `x = βε`, so `ε = x/β` and `dε = dx/β`:\n`∫₀^∞ (ε³ / (exp(βε) - 1)) dε = ∫₀^∞ ((x/β)³ / (exp(x) - 1)) (dx/β) = (1/β⁴) ∫₀^∞ (x³ / (exp(x) - 1)) dx`\n\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function: `∫₀^∞ (x^(s-1) / (exp(x) - 1)) dx = Γ(s)ζ(s)`. For `s-1=3`, we have `s=4`.\n`∫₀^∞ (x³ / (exp(x) - 1)) dx = Γ(4)ζ(4) = 3! * (π⁴/90) = 6 * (π⁴/90) = π⁴/15`\n\nSubstituting back into the expression for `U`:\n`U = (V / (π² ħ³ c³)) * (1/β⁴) * (π⁴/15) = (V π² / (15 ħ³ c³ β⁴))`\nSince `β = 1/(k_B T)`:\n`U = (V π² k_B⁴ / (15 ħ³ c³)) T⁴`\nThis is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**6. Calculation of Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nThe entropy can be calculated using the thermodynamic relation `S = (U - F)/T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy. For a system with `μ=0`, `F` is equal to the grand potential `Ω = -k_B T ln(Z)`, where `Z` is the grand partition function.\n\n`ln(Z) = -Σ_i g_i ln(1 - exp(-βε_i))`\nIn the continuum limit:\n`ln(Z) = -∫₀^∞ g(ε) ln(1 - exp(-βε)) dε = - (V / (π² ħ³ c³)) ∫₀^∞ ε² ln(1 - exp(-βε)) dε`\n\nWe solve the integral using integration by parts, with `u = ln(1 - exp(-βε))` and `dv = ε² dε`. This gives:\n`∫₀^∞ ε² ln(1 - exp(-βε)) dε = - (β/3) ∫₀^∞ (ε³ / (exp(βε) - 1)) dε = - (β/3) * (π⁴ / (15β⁴)) = -π⁴ / (45β³)`\n\nSubstituting back into `ln(Z)`:\n`ln(Z) = - (V / (π² ħ³ c³)) * (-π⁴ / (45β³)) = (V π² / (45 ħ³ c³ β³))`\n\nNow, we find the free energy `F`:\n`F = -k_B T ln(Z) = -(1/β) ln(Z) = -(1/β) * (V π² / (45 ħ³ c³ β³)) = -(V π² / (45 ħ³ c³ β⁴))`\n`F = -(V π² k_B⁴ / (45 ħ³ c³)) T⁴`\n\nFinally, we calculate the entropy `S`:\n`S = (U - F) / T = (1/T) [ (V π² k_B⁴ T⁴ / (15 ħ³ c³)) - (-(V π² k_B⁴ T⁴ / (45 ħ³ c³))) ]`\n`S = (1/T) [ (3/45 + 1/45) * (V π² k_B⁴ T⁴ / (ħ³ c³)) ]`\n`S = (1/T) [ (4/45) * (V π² k_B⁴ T⁴ / (ħ³ c³)) ]`\n`S = (4 V π² k_B⁴ / (45 ħ³ c³)) T³`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy `U` and entropy `S` of a photon gas in a volume `V` at temperature `T` are:\n\n**Mean Energy (U):**\n`U = (π² V k_B⁴ / (15 ħ³ c³)) T⁴`\n\n**Entropy (S):**\n`S = (4 π² V k_B⁴ / (45 ħ³ c³)) T³`\n\nwhere `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nMean Energy: $U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^4$\nEntropy: $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 \\hbar^3 c^3} T^3$\n>>>"
