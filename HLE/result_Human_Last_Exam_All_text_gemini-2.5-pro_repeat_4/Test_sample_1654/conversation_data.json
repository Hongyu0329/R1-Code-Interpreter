    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The goal is to count the number of distinct times Anton Chekov describes or mentions an action involving the coat of the police superintendent, Otchumyelov, in the short story \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Symbolism:** The question correctly notes that the coat is a key symbol. Otchumyelov's actions with his coat—taking it off when he's flustered and trying to appease someone powerful, and putting it on when he feels authoritative and severe—directly reflect his changing allegiances and spineless mentality. Therefore, any mention of him taking it off, putting it on, or wearing it is a significant descriptive act.\n\n3.  **Break Down the Story's Narrative to Track the Coat:** We must go through the story chronologically and pinpoint every moment the coat is mentioned.\n\n    *   **Instance 1: The Introduction.**\n        The story begins by introducing Otchumyelov.\n        *   **Description:** He is walking across the market square in a \"new overcoat.\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the first mention. It establishes his official appearance and authority.\n\n    *   **Instance 2: The First Shift in Opinion.**\n        Otchumyelov initially takes a hard line against the dog. But when someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, he immediately changes his tune and becomes flustered.\n        *   **Description:** Feeling suddenly hot, he tells his subordinate, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the second mention. The physical act of removing the coat symbolizes him shedding his authoritative stance to become subservient.\n\n    *   **Instance 3: The Second Shift in Opinion.**\n        Someone else in the crowd then says that the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov's attitude reverses again.\n        *   **Description:** He feels a sudden chill and says, \"Put on my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad... there's a wind getting up.... I am cold.\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the third mention. Putting the coat back on represents the return of his false authority and severity.\n\n    *   **Instance 4: The Third Shift in Opinion.**\n        The policeman Yeldyrin muses that it still *could* be the General's dog. This renewed possibility of a connection to power makes Otchumyelov panic again.\n        *   **Description:** He exclaims, \"You take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the fourth mention. He once again sheds his coat, mirroring his shift back to a fawning and fearful state.\n\n    *   **Instance 5: The Fourth Shift in Opinion.**\n        The General's cook, Prohor, appears and states definitively that the dog does not belong to the General. Otchumyelov is relieved to be able to act tough again.\n        *   **Description:** After scolding Prohor, he turns to the policeman and says, \"Put my coat on.\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the fifth mention. The coat goes back on as his official, intimidating persona is restored.\n\n    *   **Instance 6: The Final Resolution.**\n        Just as the matter seems settled, Prohor adds that the dog belongs to the General's brother, who has recently arrived. Otchumyelov's entire demeanor changes to one of delight and tenderness toward the \"darling\" dog.\n        *   **Description:** The story concludes as \"Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat and continues on his way across the market-square.\"\n        *   **Analysis:** This is the sixth and final mention. He wraps the coat around himself not out of cold or authority, but as a final act of restoring his composure after the confusing ordeal, now secure in the knowledge that he has sided with the powerful.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"Describe\":** In this literary context, \"describing the coat\" is not limited to adjectives. It includes any action where the coat is the central object (putting on, taking off, wrapping), as these actions are Chekov's primary method of describing Otchumyelov's state of mind.\n*   **Consistency Across Translations:** While the exact wording might vary (e.g., \"overcoat,\" \"greatcoat\"), the number of times the action occurs remains consistent across standard English translations of the original Russian text.\n*   **Counting Distinct Moments:** Each instance represents a separate, deliberate choice by Chekov to use the coat to illustrate a shift in the character's psychology. We are counting these distinct narrative moments.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy tracking the narrative and counting each distinct moment Chekov uses the coat to symbolize Otchumyelov's changing mentality, we arrive at the following count:\n1.  Initial appearance in the coat.\n2.  Taking the coat off.\n3.  Putting the coat on.\n4.  Taking the coat off again.\n5.  Putting the coat on again.\n6.  Wrapping the coat at the end.\n\nThe total number of times is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
