    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Type of Differential Equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis equation is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We can see that it is possible to group all terms involving $x$ on one side of the equation and all terms involving $t$ on the other side. This means the equation is **separable**.\n\n**2. Separate the Variables**\nTo separate the variables, we divide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply both sides by $dt$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n*   **Careful Point:** When we divide by $x^2$, we are implicitly assuming that $x(t) \\neq 0$. We should check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. Substituting this into the original equation gives $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which simplifies to $0=0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant (or equilibrium) solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the zero solution, and it is safe to divide by $x^2$.\n\n**3. Integrate Both Sides**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   The left-hand side integral:\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} $$\n*   The right-hand side integral:\n    $$ \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t $$\nCombining these results and adding a single constant of integration, $C$, we get the general solution in implicit form:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant C**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation to solve for $C$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n*   **Careful Point:** Be very careful with the signs. $-\\frac{1}{(-8)}$ becomes $+\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**5. Write the Particular Solution**\nNow, substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Solve for x(t) explicitly (optional but good practice)**\nTo find the final answer, we don't strictly need the explicit form of $x(t)$, but it can be helpful. Let's solve for $x$:\nFirst, multiply by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = -(\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nThen, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 8:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{8}{8(-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8})} = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1} $$\n\n**7. Calculate x(1)**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution. We can use the implicit form from step 5, as it might be simpler.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nFind a common denominator (8) for the right side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nNow, solve for $x(1)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n*   **Careful Point:** Ensure the arithmetic is correct, especially when combining fractions and handling signs.\n\nThe final answer is $\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
