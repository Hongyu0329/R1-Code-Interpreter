    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a hereditary algebra of Dynkin type $A_3$, and it is representation-finite.\n\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules can be denoted by $M_{ij}$ for $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$, representing the module with support on vertices $\\{i, i+1, \\dots, j\\}$ and identity maps on the arrows. There are $\\frac{3(4)}{2}=6$ such modules:\n*   $S_1 = M_{11}$: The simple module at vertex 1. This is also the injective module $I_1$.\n*   $S_2 = M_{22}$: The simple module at vertex 2.\n*   $S_3 = M_{33}$: The simple module at vertex 3. This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n*   $M_{12}$: This is the injective module $I_2$.\n*   $M_{23}$: This is the projective module $P_2$.\n*   $M_{13}$: This is both the projective module $P_1$ and the injective module $I_3$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules\nThe question uses modern terminology from $\\tau$-tilting theory.\n*   **Support $\\tau$-tilting module**: An $A$-module $T$ is a support $\\tau$-tilting module if it can be written as $T=M \\oplus P$, where $P$ is a projective $A$-module and $M$ is a $\\tau$-rigid $A$-module (i.e., $\\text{Hom}_A(M, \\tau M) = 0$) such that $\\text{Hom}_A(M, P) = 0$ and the number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands of $T$ is equal to the number of simple $A$-modules (which is 3). For algebras of type $A_n$, there are $C_{n+1}$ support $\\tau$-tilting modules. For $A_3$, this is $C_4=14$.\n*   **Slice module**: A slice module is a tilting module whose endomorphism algebra is isomorphic to the path algebra of the same underlying graph ($A_3$ in this case) with some orientation. There are 4 possible orientations of the $A_3$ graph ($1-2-3$):\n    1.  $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$\n    2.  $1 \\leftarrow 2 \\leftarrow 3$\n    3.  $1 \\to 2 \\leftarrow 3$\n    4.  $1 \\leftarrow 2 \\to 3$\n    Thus, there are 4 slice modules among the 14 support $\\tau$-tilting modules.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Phrasing of the Question\nThe question asks for \"the unique $\\tau$-tilting module which is not a slice\". Since there are 14 support $\\tau$-tilting modules and only 4 are slices, there are 10 non-slice modules. The use of the word \"unique\" implies that the sought-after module has a special property that distinguishes it from all other 13 modules, including the other 9 non-slice modules.\n\n### Step 4: Identify a Candidate Module with a Unique Property\nLet's consider the module $T = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3$, which is the direct sum of all non-isomorphic simple modules. Let's analyze its properties.\n\n*   **Is it a support $\\tau$-tilting module?**\n    To verify this, we need the Auslander-Reiten translation $\\tau$. For the linear orientation of $A_3$, the action of $\\tau$ on simple modules is: $\\tau S_1 = 0$ (since $S_1$ is injective), $\\tau S_3 = 0$ (since $S_3$ is projective), and $\\tau S_2 = S_3$.\n    Let's decompose $T$ as $M \\oplus P$. Since $S_3=P_3$ is a projective summand, we can choose $P=S_3$ and $M=S_1 \\oplus S_2$.\n    Now we check the conditions for $(M,P)$ being a support $\\tau$-tilting pair:\n    1.  $|M| + |P| = 2 + 1 = 3$. (Correct number of summands)\n    2.  $P=S_3$ is projective. (Correct)\n    3.  $M=S_1 \\oplus S_2$ must be $\\tau$-rigid. We compute $\\tau M = \\tau S_1 \\oplus \\tau S_2 = 0 \\oplus S_3 = S_3$. We check $\\text{Hom}_A(M, \\tau M) = \\text{Hom}_A(S_1 \\oplus S_2, S_3)$. This is 0, since there are no non-zero maps from $S_1$ or $S_2$ to $S_3$. So $M$ is $\\tau$-rigid. (Correct)\n    4.  $\\text{Hom}_A(M, P) = \\text{Hom}_A(S_1 \\oplus S_2, S_3) = 0$. (Correct)\n    Thus, $S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3$ is indeed a support $\\tau$-tilting module.\n\n*   **Is it a slice module?**\n    A module is a slice module if its endomorphism algebra is a path algebra of $A_3$. Let's compute $\\text{End}_A(T)$:\n    $\\text{End}_A(S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3) \\cong \\begin{pmatrix} \\text{Hom}(S_1,S_1) & \\text{Hom}(S_2,S_1) & \\text{Hom}(S_3,S_1) \\\\ \\text{Hom}(S_1,S_2) & \\text{Hom}(S_2,S_2) & \\text{Hom}(S_3,S_2) \\\\ \\text{Hom}(S_1,S_3) & \\text{Hom}(S_2,S_3) & \\text{Hom}(S_3,S_3) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    For the linear quiver $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$, $\\text{Hom}_A(S_i, S_j) = 0$ for $i \\ne j$. So,\n    $\\text{End}_A(T) \\cong \\begin{pmatrix} k & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & k & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & k \\end{pmatrix} \\cong k \\times k \\times k$.\n    This is a semisimple, commutative algebra. The path algebra of any orientation of $A_3$ is not semisimple (it has non-zero radical). Therefore, $S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3$ is not a slice module.\n\n*   **Is it unique in this regard?**\n    The property that its endomorphism algebra is commutative (and even semisimple) is unique among all 14 support $\\tau$-tilting modules. Any other support $\\tau$-tilting module must contain at least one non-simple indecomposable module $M_{ij}$. Any such module allows for non-trivial homomorphisms to or from other simple or non-simple indecomposable modules in a way that makes the endomorphism algebra non-commutative. For example, any support $\\tau$-tilting module containing $M_{12}$ and $S_2$ would have $\\text{Hom}(M_{12}, S_2) \\ne 0$ but $\\text{Hom}(S_2, M_{12}) = 0$. The module $S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3$ is the only support $\\tau$-tilting module whose indecomposable summands are pairwise orthogonal (i.e., $\\text{Hom}(X,Y)=0$ for any two distinct summands $X,Y$). This makes it uniquely non-slice in a very strong sense.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe module $S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3$ is a support $\\tau$-tilting module. It is not a slice module because its endomorphism ring is semisimple. This property is unique among all support $\\tau$-tilting modules for this algebra, justifying the phrasing of the question.\n\n<<<S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus S_3>>>"
