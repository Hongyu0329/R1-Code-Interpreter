    "This problem involves finding sufficient conditions for the existence of a special type of fixed point for a system of three functions. The solution is typically found by applying a generalization of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem to a product space.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem and Clarify Assumptions**\n\nFirst, we must precisely define the components of the problem.\n\n*   **Functions and Spaces:** We are given three sets, X, Y, and Z, and three functions. There appears to be a typo in the question, as the function `G` is listed twice with different domains. We will assume the standard convention for such problems and correct the second `G` to `H`. The functions are therefore:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe goal is to find a set of conditions on the spaces X, Y, Z and the functions F, G, H that guarantees at least one such point `(x, y, z)` exists.\n\n**Step 2: Reformulate as a Single Fixed Point Problem**\n\nThe system of three equations can be simplified by considering it as a single fixed point equation in a larger space.\n\n*   **Product Space:** We define a product space `S = X × Y × Z`. An element in this space is a triplet `p = (x, y, z)`.\n*   **Combined Operator:** We define a single operator `T: S → S` that combines the actions of F, G, and H:\n    `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n*   **Equivalence:** A fixed point of this operator `T` is a point `p = (x, y, z)` such that `T(p) = p`. Expanding this equation gives:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`\n    `(F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x)) = (x, y, z)`\n    This is precisely the system of equations defining an FGH-tripled fixed point. Therefore, finding conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point is equivalent to finding conditions for the operator `T` to have a fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Fixed Point Theorem**\n\nThe most powerful tool for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point is the Banach Fixed Point Theorem (also known as the Contraction Mapping Principle). This theorem requires two main conditions:\n\n1.  The space `S` must be a **complete metric space**.\n2.  The operator `T` must be a **contraction mapping** on `S`.\n\n**Step 4: Establish Conditions on X, Y, Z, F, G, H**\n\nWe now translate the abstract requirements of the Banach theorem into concrete conditions on our original spaces and functions.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Complete Metric Space**\n    *   For the product space `S = X × Y × Z` to be a complete metric space, each of its component spaces must be a complete metric space. Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be the respective metric spaces.\n    *   We define a metric on `S`, for example, the sum metric:\n        `d((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   If `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete, then the product space `S` with this metric is also complete.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Contraction Mapping**\n    *   The operator `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `p1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2, z2)` in `S`, the following inequality holds:\n        `d(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ k * d(p1, p2)`\n    *   Let's expand this inequality using our definitions of `T` and `d`:\n        `d_X(F(x1,...), F(x2,...)) + d_Y(G(y1,...), G(y2,...)) + d_Z(H(z1,...), H(z2,...)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n    *   To satisfy this, we impose Lipschitz-type conditions on F, G, and H. We assume there exist non-negative constants (`α`, `β`, `γ`) such that:\n        1.  `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α1*d_X(x1, x2) + α2*d_Y(y1, y2) + α3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n        2.  `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ β1*d_Y(y1, y2) + β2*d_X(x1, x2)`\n        3.  `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ γ1*d_Z(z1, z2) + γ2*d_Y(y1, y2) + γ3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n    *   Summing these three inequalities gives an upper bound for the left-hand side of the contraction inequality:\n        `d(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ (α1 + β2 + γ3)d_X(x1, x2) + (α2 + β1 + γ2)d_Y(y1, y2) + (α3 + γ1)d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   For this to be a contraction, we need the sum on the right to be less than or equal to `k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` for some `k < 1`. A sufficient way to ensure this is to require that the coefficient of each distance term is less than `k`. A simpler, sufficient condition is that the maximum of these coefficient sums is less than 1.\n    *   Let `L_x = α1 + β2 + γ3`, `L_y = α2 + β1 + γ2`, and `L_z = α3 + γ1`.\n    *   The final condition is `max(L_x, L_y, L_z) < 1`.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Typo Assumption:** The analysis is based on the critical assumption that the second function `G:Z*Y*X→Z` in the question was a typo for `H:Z*Y*X→Z`. If this is not the case, the analysis would change slightly (replacing H with a second function named G), but the methodology remains the same.\n2.  **Definition of the Fixed Point:** The structure of the fixed point equations (`F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, etc.) depends entirely on the specified domains and codomains of the functions. The analysis strictly follows the given (and corrected) structure, which is non-standard compared to typical tripled fixed point literature where variables are often cyclically permuted.\n3.  **Choice of Theorem:** The conditions are derived from the Banach Fixed Point Theorem. This provides *sufficient* conditions, not necessarily *necessary* ones. Other theorems (like Brouwer's or Schauder's fixed point theorems) could yield different conditions under different assumptions (e.g., continuity and compactness instead of a contraction on a complete metric space).\n4.  **Completeness is Essential:** The requirement that X, Y, and Z be *complete* metric spaces is fundamental. Without completeness, the sequence generated by iterating the operator `T` might be a Cauchy sequence but fail to converge to a point *within* the space, meaning no fixed point would exist.\n5.  **Uniqueness:** A major advantage of using the Banach Fixed Point Theorem is that it guarantees the fixed point is not only existent but also **unique**.\n6.  **Choice of Metric:** The final inequality on the Lipschitz constants was derived using a sum metric on the product space `X × Y × Z`. Using a different but equivalent metric (like a max or Euclidean-type metric) would lead to a similar, though potentially differently expressed, final condition.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are based on the Banach Contraction Mapping Principle. They are as follows:\n\n**1. Conditions on the Spaces:**\nThe sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty **complete metric spaces** equipped with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`, respectively.\n\n**2. Conditions on the Functions:**\nThe functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy specific Lipschitz continuity conditions. This means there must exist non-negative constants `α_i, β_i, γ_i` such that for any two points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in the domain:\n\n*   For `F: X × Y × Z → X`:\n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α1*d_X(x1, x2) + α2*d_Y(y1, y2) + α3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n\n*   For `G: Y × X × Y → Y`:\n    `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ β1*d_Y(y1, y2) + β2*d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n*   For `H: Z × Y × X → Z`:\n    `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ γ1*d_Z(z1, z2) + γ2*d_Y(y1, y2) + γ3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n**3. The Overall Contraction Condition:**\nThe Lipschitz constants from the previous step must collectively satisfy the following inequality:\n`max( (α1 + β2 + γ3), (α2 + β1 + γ2), (α3 + γ1) ) < 1`\n\nIf these three sets of conditions are met, there exists a unique tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` in `X × Y × Z`.\n\n<<<\nSufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point `(x,y,z)` satisfying `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z` are:\n\n**1. Space Requirement:**\n*   `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are non-empty **complete metric spaces**.\n\n**2. Function (Lipschitz) Requirement:**\n*   There exist non-negative constants `α1, α2, α3`, `β1, β2`, and `γ1, γ2, γ3` such that for all relevant points in the domains:\n    *   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α1*d_X(x1, x2) + α2*d_Y(y1, y2) + α3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ β1*d_Y(y1, y2) + β2*d_X(x1, x2)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ γ1*d_Z(z1, z2) + γ2*d_Y(y1, y2) + γ3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n**3. Contraction Requirement:**\n*   The sum of the Lipschitz constants must satisfy the inequality:\n    `max( (α1 + β2 + γ3), (α2 + β1 + γ2), (α3 + γ1) ) < 1`\n>>>"
