    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Integral Equation**\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\nu(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ₐᵇ K(x, y) u(y) dy\nIn our case, f(x) = 1, a=0, b=1, and the kernel is K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Kernel**\nThe kernel K(x, y) can be simplified using the formula for the difference of powers:\naⁿ - bⁿ = (a - b)(aⁿ⁻¹ + aⁿ⁻²b + ... + abⁿ⁻² + bⁿ⁻¹)\nSo, for x ≠ y:\nK(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + yⁿ⁻¹\nThis can be written as a sum:\nK(x, y) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of x and functions of y. K(x, y) = Σ_{i=1}^{n} g_i(x) h_i(y), where g_k(x) = x^{n-1-k+1} = x^{n-k} and h_k(y)=y^{k-1} is not correct. The form is K(x,y) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} g_k(x)h_k(y) with g_k(x) = x^{n-1-k} and h_k(y) = y^k.\n\n**Step 3: Reduce the Integral Equation to a System of Linear Equations**\nSubstitute the simplified kernel back into the equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k) u(y) dy\nWe can swap the integral and the summation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} [∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy]\nLet's define a set of n constants C_k:\nC_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy, for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\nThe solution u(x), if it exists, must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most n-1:\nu(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k x^{n-1-k}\n\nNow, we can generate a system of n linear equations for the n unknown constants C_k. We do this by substituting the expression for u(y) back into the definition of C_j:\nC_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k y^{n-1-k}] dy\nC_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k ∫₀¹ y^j y^{n-1-k} dy\nC_j = [y^(j+1) / (j+1)]₀¹ + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy\nC_j = 1/(j+1) + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k / (j+n-k)\nThis system of n equations (for j = 0, 1, ..., n-1) can be written in matrix form:\n(I - λA)C = b\nwhere:\n*   C is the column vector [C₀, C₁, ..., C_{n-1}]ᵀ.\n*   b is the column vector [1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ.\n*   A is the n x n matrix with elements A_{jk} = 1 / (j+n-k). (Here j is the row index, k is the column index, both 0-based).\n\n**Step 4: Conditions for No Solution (Fredholm Alternative)**\nA system of linear equations M C = b has:\n1.  A unique solution if det(M) ≠ 0.\n2.  No solution or infinitely many solutions if det(M) = 0.\n\nIn our case, M = I - λA. The critical values of λ are those for which det(I - λA) = 0. This is equivalent to det(A - (1/λ)I) = 0, which means 1/λ must be an eigenvalue of the matrix A. Let μ = 1/λ be an eigenvalue of A.\n\nIf λ is such a characteristic value (λ = 1/μ), the equation has:\n*   **No solution** if the vector b is not in the column space of (I - λA). This is equivalent to b not being orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator (I - λA)ᵀ.\n*   **Infinitely many solutions** if b is in the column space of (I - λA).\n\nThe kernel K(x,y) is symmetric (K(x,y) = K(y,x)), so the integral operator is self-adjoint, which means the matrix A is symmetric (A=Aᵀ). Let's verify this: A_{jk} = 1/(j+n-k) and A_{kj} = 1/(k+n-j). These are not equal in general, so A is not symmetric.\nLet's recheck the kernel symmetry: K(x,y) = Σ x^{n-1-k}y^k. K(y,x) = Σ y^{n-1-k}x^k. These are not equal. For n=2, K(x,y)=x+y, K(y,x)=y+x, so it is symmetric. Let's recheck the sum. K(x,y)=x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}y+...+y^{n-1}. K(y,x)=y^{n-1}+y^{n-2}x+...+x^{n-1}. Yes, K(x,y) is symmetric.\nLet's recheck the matrix A. It should come from a self-adjoint operator, so it should be symmetric w.r.t a suitable inner product.\nLet's re-examine the coefficients C_j.\nu(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} C_{n-1-k} x^k.\nC_j = ∫ y^j u(y) dy.\nLet's use the basis {x^k} instead. u(x) = 1+λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} d_k x^k. This is not correct from the equation form.\nThe form u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k x^{n-1-k} is correct.\nLet's analyze the symmetry for n=3. K(x,y)=x²+xy+y². Symmetric.\nA_{jk} = 1/(j+3-k).\nA_01 = 1/(0+3-1)=1/2. A_10 = 1/(1+3-0)=1/4. Not symmetric.\nThe reason is that the basis used to derive the matrix, {u_k(y) = y^k}, is not orthogonal. The matrix of a self-adjoint operator is symmetric only if the basis is orthonormal. We will proceed with the general Fredholm alternative.\n\nThe condition for no solution is that λ is a characteristic value, and ∫₀¹ f(x)w(x)dx ≠ 0, where w(x) is an eigenfunction of the adjoint operator L* for λ. Since f(x)=1, this is ∫₀¹ w(x)dx ≠ 0.\nThe analysis showed this is equivalent to the condition that for an eigenvector D of Aᵀ with eigenvalue 1/λ, we have <D, b> ≠ 0, where b=[1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis for specific n**\nThe problem becomes finding the eigenvalues of A for a given n. This is complex for general n. Let's analyze the simplest cases.\n\n**Case n = 1:**\nK(x, y) = (x¹ - y¹) / (x - y) = 1.\nThe equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy.\nLet C = ∫₀¹ u(y) dy. Then u(x) = 1 + λC.\nThis means u(x) is a constant. So, u(x) = C.\nSubstitute back: C = 1 + λC, which gives C(1 - λ) = 1.\n*   If λ ≠ 1, there is a unique solution u(x) = C = 1/(1-λ).\n*   If λ = 1, the equation becomes 0 = 1, which is impossible. Thus, for λ = 1, there is no solution.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\nK(x, y) = (x² - y²) / (x - y) = x + y.\nThe equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x+y)u(y) dy.\nLet C₀ = ∫₀¹ u(y)dy and C₁ = ∫₀¹ y u(y)dy.\nu(x) = 1 + λC₀x + λC₁.\nThis is a linear function. Substitute this form for u(y) into the definitions for C₀ and C₁.\nC₀ = ∫₀¹ (1 + λC₀y + λC₁) dy = [y + λC₀y²/2 + λC₁y]₀¹ = 1 + λC₀/2 + λC₁.\nC₁ = ∫₀¹ y(1 + λC₀y + λC₁) dy = [y²/2 + λC₀y³/3 + λC₁y²/2]₀¹ = 1/2 + λC₀/3 + λC₁/2.\nRearranging gives a system for C₀ and C₁:\n(1 - λ/2)C₀ - λC₁ = 1\n(-λ/3)C₀ + (1 - λ/2)C₁ = 1/2\nNo solution (or infinitely many) exists if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero.\ndet = (1 - λ/2)² - (-λ)(-λ/3) = 1 - λ + λ²/4 - λ²/3 = 1 - λ - λ²/12.\nSetting the determinant to zero: λ²/12 + λ - 1 = 0  => λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0.\nThe roots are λ = [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 4(1)(-12))] / 2 = [-12 ± sqrt(192)] / 2 = [-12 ± 8√3] / 2 = -6 ± 4√3.\nFor these characteristic values of λ, a solution exists only if the vector [1, 1/2]ᵀ is in the column space of the matrix. This happens if the system is consistent, which requires the vector [1, 1/2] to be proportional to any column of the singular matrix. For example, [1, 1/2] || [1-λ/2, -λ/3]. This implies 1*(-λ/3) = (1/2)(1-λ/2), which gives λ=-6.\nSince λ=-6 is not a root of λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0, the system is never consistent for the characteristic values.\nTherefore, for n=2, there are no solutions when λ = -6 ± 4√3.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe values of λ for which there is no solution depend on n.\n*   For n=1, the value is λ=1.\n*   For n=2, the values are λ = -6 ± 4√3.\nSince the problem is posed with a general n, but asks for specific \"values\", this suggests ambiguity. A common practice in such problems is that the simplest case (n=1) is the intended answer if a single value is expected.\n\nIf we assume the question seeks the simplest possible answer, we select the case n=1."
