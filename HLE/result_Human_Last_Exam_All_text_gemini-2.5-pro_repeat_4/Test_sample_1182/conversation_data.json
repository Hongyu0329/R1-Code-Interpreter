    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial model and its reduction**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The coefficients are in the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, so this equation defines an integral model $\\mathcal{C}$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nTo understand the reduction, we consider the equation modulo 2. The residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$\nThis is equivalent to $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. The special fiber $\\mathcal{C}_0$ is the line $y=x$ with multiplicity 2. This is a non-reduced scheme, and therefore the model $\\mathcal{C}$ is not regular, and the reduction is unstable. We need to find a better model of the curve.\n\n**Step 2: Find a better model through a change of variables**\n\nThe presence of branch points with negative 2-adic valuation often suggests a change of coordinates. Let's find the valuations of the branch points, which are the roots of $f(x)=0$ and the point at infinity.\n$f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$. One root is $x=0$.\nLet $p(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. The Newton polygon for $p(x)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation gives the valuations of its roots. The vertices of the polygon are $(i, v_2(a_i))$ for $p(x) = \\sum a_i x^i$.\nThe points are (0,3), (1,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,3). The lower convex hull has two segments:\n1.  From (0,3) to (1,0), with slope -3. This corresponds to one root $r_1$ with $v_2(r_1) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  From (1,0) to (4,3), with slope 1. This corresponds to three roots $r_2, r_3, r_4$ with $v_2(r_i) = -(1) = -1$.\n\nThe roots having negative valuations suggests that the model can be improved by the substitution $x=z/2$.\nLet $x=z/2$. The equation $y^2=f(x)$ becomes:\n$y^2 = 8(z/2)^5 + 4(z/2)^4 + 4(z/2)^3 + (z/2)^2 + 8(z/2)$\n$y^2 = z^5/4 + z^4/4 + z^3/2 + z^2/4 + 4z$\nTo make the coefficients integral, we multiply by 4:\n$4y^2 = z^5 + z^4 + 2z^3 + z^2 + 16z$\nLet $Y=2y$. We get a new model $\\mathcal{C}'$ for a curve birational to $C$:\n$Y^2 = z^5 + z^4 + 2z^3 + z^2 + 16z$\nLet's call the polynomial on the right $h(z)$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the new model $\\mathcal{C}'$**\n\nThe branch points of this new model are $z=2x$. Their valuations are $v_2(2r_1)=1+3=4$, and $v_2(2r_i)=1-1=0$ for $i=2,3,4$. The other branch points are $z=0$ and $z=\\infty$. All finite branch points are now in the ring of integers of some extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\nLet's look at the reduction of $\\mathcal{C}'$ modulo 2:\n$Y^2 \\equiv z^5 + z^4 + z^2 \\pmod 2$\n$Y^2 \\equiv z^2(z^3 + z^2 + 1) \\pmod 2$\nThe polynomial $P(z) = z^3+z^2+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ since $P(0)=1$ and $P(1)=1$.\nThe special fiber $\\mathcal{C}'_0$ is an irreducible curve over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Let's analyze its singularity. The equation is of the form $Y^2=z^2(\\text{...})$, which signals a singularity at $(z,Y)=(0,0)$. The tangent cone at $(0,0)$ is given by the lowest degree terms, $Y^2-z^2=0$, which is $(Y-z)^2=0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This is a cusp.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of a plane curve with only a cusp as singularity is given by $p_a = g_{norm} + \\delta$, where $g_{norm}$ is the genus of its normalization and $\\delta$ is the delta-invariant of the singularity. For a cusp, $\\delta=1$.\nThe normalization of $Y^2 = z^2(z^3+z^2+1)$ is obtained by the substitution $W=Y/z$, leading to the curve $W^2 = z^3+z^2+1$. This is an elliptic curve (genus 1), since $z^3+z^2+1$ has distinct roots.\nSo, the arithmetic genus of the special fiber $\\mathcal{C}'_0$ is $p_a(\\mathcal{C}'_0) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe genus of the generic fiber $C$ is $g = \\lfloor(\\deg f - 1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor=2$.\nSince the arithmetic genus of the special fiber of $\\mathcal{C}'$ equals the genus of the generic fiber, it is possible that $\\mathcal{C}'$ is a minimal regular model. For this to be true, the model $\\mathcal{C}'$ must be regular.\n\n**Step 4: Check if the model $\\mathcal{C}'$ is regular**\n\nA model given by $F(z,Y)=0$ is regular if there are no points $(z_0, Y_0)$ on the model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ for which the partial derivatives $\\partial F/\\partial z$ and $\\partial F/\\partial Y$ are both zero modulo 2.\nHere, $F(z,Y) = Y^2 - (z^5 + z^4 + 2z^3 + z^2 + 16z)$.\n$\\partial F / \\partial Y = 2Y \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ for any $Y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n$\\partial F / \\partial z = -(5z^4 + 4z^3 + 6z^2 + 2z + 16)$.\nThe only singularity on the special fiber is at $(0,0)$. We only need to check points on the model that reduce to $(0,0)$, i.e., points $(z_0, Y_0)$ with $v_2(z_0) \\ge 1$ and $v_2(Y_0) \\ge 1$.\nFor such a point, $v_2(5z_0^4) \\ge 4$, $v_2(4z_0^3) \\ge 5$, $v_2(6z_0^2) \\ge 3$, $v_2(2z_0) \\ge 2$, and $v_2(16)=4$. All terms in $\\partial F / \\partial z$ are divisible by 2.\nThus, for any point $(z_0, Y_0)$ on the model reducing to $(0,0)$, both partial derivatives vanish modulo 2. This means the model $\\mathcal{C}'$ is singular.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure of the stable reduction**\n\nSince the model $\\mathcal{C}'$ is singular, we must resolve its singularities to find the minimal regular model and thus the stable reduction. The singularity is at the point that reduces to the cusp $(0,0)$ of the special fiber.\nThe resolution of this singularity will replace the singular point with one or more components. The original component (the strict transform of $\\mathcal{C}'_0$) will become smooth, i.e., it will become its normalization, the elliptic curve $E: W^2=z^3+z^2+1$.\nThe full special fiber of the stable model, $\\mathcal{C}_{s,0}$, will consist of the elliptic curve $E$ and a set of rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$s) arising from the resolution process.\nThe arithmetic genus of the stable fiber must be equal to the genus of the original curve, which is 2. Let the stable fiber consist of $M$ components with genera $g_i$, and let $\\delta$ be the total number of double points (intersections between components). Assuming the components form a tree structure (no loops), the arithmetic genus is given by the formula:\n$p_a(\\mathcal{C}_{s,0}) = \\sum g_i + \\delta - M + 1$.\nSetting $p_a=2$, we have $2 = \\sum g_i + \\delta - M + 1$.\n\nIn our case, one component is an elliptic curve $E$ (so $g_1=1$), and the other $M-1$ components are rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$s, so $g_i=0$ for $i>1$).\n$2 = 1 + \\sum_{i=2}^{M} 0 + \\delta - M + 1$\n$2 = 2 + \\delta - M$\n$\\delta = M$.\n\nThe number of double points is equal to the number of components.\nThe simplest configuration is that the singularity resolution introduces a single rational curve, say $P_1$. Then the stable fiber consists of two components: the elliptic curve $E$ and the rational curve $P_1$ ($M=2$).\nIn this case, $\\delta = M = 2$.\nThe stable reduction would consist of an elliptic curve and a rational curve intersecting at two points. This is a stable curve of arithmetic genus $p_a = g_E + g_{P_1} + \\delta - M + 1 = 1 + 0 + 2 - 2 + 1 = 2$.\nThis is a very common type of stable reduction for a genus 2 curve. The number of double points in this configuration is the number of intersection points, which is 2.\n\nFinal conclusion: The stable reduction consists of an elliptic curve and a rational curve intersecting at two points. The number of double points is the number of these intersections."
