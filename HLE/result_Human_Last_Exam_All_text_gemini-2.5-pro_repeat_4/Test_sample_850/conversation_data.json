    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes (point groups) that simultaneously satisfy three conditions:\n1.  They must be **achiral**.\n2.  They must be **non-polar**.\n3.  They must have the **correct symmetry for optical activity**.\n\n**2. Analyze Condition 1: Achiral Symmetry**\n*   An object or crystal structure is **achiral** if it is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   In terms of symmetry elements, a crystal class is achiral if its point group contains at least one **improper rotation axis** ($\\bar{n}$).\n*   Improper rotation axes include an **inversion center** ($i$, which is equivalent to $\\bar{1}$) and a **mirror plane** ($m$, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$).\n*   Of the 32 crystal classes, 21 are achiral.\n\n**3. Analyze Condition 3: Symmetry for Optical Activity**\n*   **Optical activity** is the phenomenon where a material rotates the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light that passes through it.\n*   The fundamental symmetry requirement for a material to exhibit natural optical activity is that it must be **chiral**.\n*   A chiral object or crystal structure is one that is **not** superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   In terms of symmetry elements, a crystal class is chiral if its point group **lacks all improper rotation axes**. This means it has no inversion center and no mirror planes.\n*   There are 11 chiral crystal classes that permit optical activity: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, and 432.\n\n**4. Identify the Contradiction**\n*   From the analysis above, we see a direct contradiction:\n    *   Condition 1 requires the crystal class to be **achiral**.\n    *   Condition 3 requires the crystal class to be **chiral**.\n*   By definition, a crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time. These two categories are mutually exclusive and partition the 32 crystal classes completely.\n\n**5. Analyze Condition 2: Non-Polar Symmetry**\n*   A crystal class is **polar** if it has at least one unique direction (a polar axis) that is not mapped onto its opposite by any symmetry operation in the group. This allows for properties like pyroelectricity.\n*   There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n*   A **non-polar** crystal class is any of the remaining 22 classes that are not polar. This includes all 11 centrosymmetric classes (which have an inversion center) and 11 other non-polar classes.\n\n**6. Synthesize and Conclude**\n*   The question asks for the set of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions. This is equivalent to finding the intersection of three sets: {Achiral Classes} ∩ {Non-Polar Classes} ∩ {Chiral Classes}.\n*   Because the set of achiral classes and the set of chiral classes are disjoint (their intersection is the empty set), the intersection of all three sets must also be the empty set.\n*   Therefore, there are no crystal classes that can simultaneously be achiral and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Strict Definitions:** The solution relies on the strict, universally accepted definitions of chirality and optical activity in crystallography. Optical activity requires chirality.\n*   **Distinction from other phenomena:** It's important not to confuse the requirement for optical activity (chirality) with the requirement for other optical effects like second-harmonic generation (SHG) or the Pockels effect. These effects require the crystal to be **non-centrosymmetric** (lacking an inversion center), which is a less strict condition than chirality. There are non-centrosymmetric classes that are achiral (e.g., class m, class $\\bar{4}$), but these are not optically active.\n*   **Contradictory Premise:** The question is based on a contradictory premise. It is likely designed to test the understanding that optical activity and achirality are mutually exclusive properties.\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, no crystal class can satisfy the given conditions.\n\n<<<No crystal classes satisfy all these conditions, as the requirements of being \"achiral\" and having the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" (which implies being chiral) are mutually exclusive.>>>"
