    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the solution to an equation written with Roman numerals: `XXIV/CCC - CXXXI = ?`. The answer needs to be in modern numbers.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution**\n\n1.  **Convert Roman Numerals to Modern Numbers:**\n    *   **XXIV**: 'X' represents 10, and 'IV' represents 4 (5 - 1). So, XXIV = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24.\n    *   **CCC**: 'C' represents 100. So, CCC = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\n    *   **CXXXI**: 'C' is 100, 'X' is 10, and 'I' is 1. So, CXXXI = 100 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 131.\n\n2.  **Rewrite the Equation with Modern Numbers:**\n    Substituting the converted values into the original equation, we get:\n    `24 / 300 - 131 = ?`\n\n3.  **Solve the Equation:**\n    We must follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means we perform division before subtraction.\n    *   **Step 3a: Division**\n        Calculate the value of `24 / 300`.\n        `24 ÷ 300 = 0.08`\n    *   **Step 3b: Subtraction**\n        Now, substitute the result back into the equation.\n        `0.08 - 131`\n        `0.08 - 131 = -130.92`\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Roman Numeral Conversion:** Ensure the rules for Roman numerals are applied correctly, especially the subtractive principle (like IV = 4).\n*   **Order of Operations:** It is crucial to perform the division (`/`) before the subtraction (`-`). A common mistake would be to calculate `300 - 131` first, which would be incorrect.\n*   **Decimal Calculation:** The division `24 / 300` results in a decimal, which must be calculated accurately.\n*   **Negative Result:** The subtraction results in a negative number, as a smaller number (0.08) is being subtracted by a larger number (131).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution to the equation is -130.92.\n\n<<<-130.92>>>"
