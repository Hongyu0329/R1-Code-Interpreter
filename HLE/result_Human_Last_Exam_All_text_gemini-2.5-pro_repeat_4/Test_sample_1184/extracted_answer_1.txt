**1. Hotspots for Interaction (Binding to alpha-1 subunit):**
The primary interaction site on the beta-1 subunit is a hydrophobic groove within its Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain. Based on structural analysis and using the residue numbering for human CACNB1b (UniProt P27744-1), the key hotspot residues are:
*   **Y246 (Tyrosine)**
*   **L299 (Leucine)**
*   **V303 (Valine)**
*   **M370 (Methionine)**
*   **V374 (Valine)**
*   **I377 (Isoleucine)**
*   **A381 (Alanine)**

**2. Hotspots for Gating Modulation (Fine-tuning of alpha-1 subunit):**
Gating modulation occurs at multiple levels.
*   **Modulation of Activation:** The fundamental modulation of voltage-dependent activation is a direct result of binding. Therefore, the same interaction hotspots listed above (**Y246, L299, V303, M370, V374, I377, A381**) are also the primary hotspots for modulating channel activation.
*   **Fine-tuning of Inactivation Kinetics:** The N-terminus of the beta-1b isoform is a critical region for slowing the rate of channel inactivation. Key hotspot residues within this region are:
    *   **D8 (Aspartate)**
    *   **D13 (Aspartate)**
