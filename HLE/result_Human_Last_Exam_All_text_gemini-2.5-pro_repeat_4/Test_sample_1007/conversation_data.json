    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify a classical ballet step where the configuration of the legs (which foot is in front, which is in back, and the position itself, e.g., fifth position) is identical at the beginning and at the end of the movement. We will assume the starting position for these steps is the standard fifth position.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Answer Choices:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a jump where the legs beat and change position three times in the air (resulting in six movements). The sequence is: open, cross behind, open, cross in front, open, cross behind.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The number \"six\" indicates three changes. An odd number of changes means the starting and ending front foot will be different. Therefore, the position changes.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** The dancer performs an *échappé* (a jump opening from fifth to second position) and then jumps back to fifth. The word *battu* means the legs beat together as they close, and *changé* explicitly means \"changed.\"\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term *changé* in the name of the step is a direct indicator that the feet change position.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** The name means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one foot out (e.g., the back foot slides to the side), jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air to land on both feet simultaneously in fifth position. In a basic, non-traveling *assemblé* (an *assemblé sur place*), the legs return to their original configuration.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the exact same fifth position they started in (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** While there are variations of *assemblé* that do change the feet (like *assemblé dessus* or *dessous*), the fundamental, unmodified step does not. Among the given choices, it is the one whose basic form ends as it began.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Glissade* means \"to glide,\" and *derrière* means \"behind.\" The dancer glides the back foot out to the side, transfers weight, and then closes the front foot *behind* the other into fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Because the foot that was in front closes to the back, the feet have now switched places. The dancer ends in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The instruction *derrière* dictates that the closing leg moves to the back, forcing a change of the front foot.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Often begins in fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative jump, similar to a *pas de chat*, but with a small circle (*rond de jambe*) from each leg in the air.\n    *   **Ending Position:** A *gargouillade* can be performed either with a change of feet (*changé*) or without (*sans changer*). However, it very commonly finishes with the feet changed. It is not as reliably \"unchanged\" as a basic *assemblé*.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Due to its complexity and common variations that involve changing feet, it's not the most definitive answer for a step that ends in its starting position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter analyzing each step, the *assemblé* (in its fundamental form) is the only step on the list that is designed to start and end in the exact same leg position. The other steps either inherently involve a change of feet (Entrechat six, Glissade derrière) or explicitly state it in their name (Échappé battu changé).\n\n<<<C>>>"
