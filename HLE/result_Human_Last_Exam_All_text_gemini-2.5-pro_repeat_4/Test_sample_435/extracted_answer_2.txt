Based on the evidence that interleukin-15 promotes the survival, persistence, and functional fitness of memory T cells, it would be predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit an increased release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
