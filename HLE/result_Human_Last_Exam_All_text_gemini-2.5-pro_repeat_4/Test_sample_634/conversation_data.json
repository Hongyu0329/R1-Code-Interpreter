    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n*   P1(s) = [ s² + s,  -s   ]\n            [ -s² - 1, s²  ]\n\n*   P2(s) = [ s,       0    ]\n            [ -s - 1,  1    ]\n\n**2. Definition of GCRD**\n\n*   A polynomial matrix R(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n*   G(s) is a **common right divisor** of P1 and P2 if it is a right divisor of both.\n*   G(s) is the **greatest common right divisor** if any other common right divisor D(s) is also a right divisor of G(s) (i.e., G(s) = H(s)D(s) for some polynomial matrix H(s)).\n\n**3. Method for Finding the GCRD**\n\nThe standard method for finding the GCRD of two polynomial matrices is to use the matrix Euclidean algorithm. This involves performing elementary row operations on the stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] to reduce it to a simpler form, typically a row-echelon form.\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by forming the matrix M(s) and reducing it. The non-zero rows of the final reduced matrix form the GCRD.\n\nM(s) = [ P1(s) ] = [ s² + s,  -s   ]  (R1)\n       [ P2(s) ]   [ -s² - 1, s²  ]  (R2)\n                   [ s,       0    ]  (R3)\n                   [ -s - 1,  1    ]  (R4)\n\n**4. Performing Row Reduction**\n\nOur goal is to simplify this 4x2 matrix. A good strategy is to use a row with a constant entry (like the '1' in R4) to eliminate entries in other rows.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The '1' in R4 at position (4,2) is very useful. We can use it to create zeros in the second column of the other rows.\n\n*   **Step 1: Eliminate the entry in R1, column 2.**\n    We can add `s` times R4 to R1.\n    `R1_new = R1 + s * R4`\n    `R1_new = [s² + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    `R1_new = [s² + s - s(s+1), -s + s]`\n    `R1_new = [s² + s - s² - s, 0] = [0, 0]`\n    This is a significant simplification. The first row is a polynomial multiple of the fourth row (`R1 = -s * R4`). This means R1 is redundant in the set of rows that generate the module, and we can replace it with a zero row.\n\n*   **Step 2: Eliminate the entry in R2, column 2.**\n    We can subtract `s²` times R4 from R2.\n    `R2_new = R2 - s² * R4`\n    `R2_new = [-s² - 1, s²] - s² * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    `R2_new = [-s² - 1 - s²(-s-1), s² - s²]`\n    `R2_new = [-s² - 1 + s³ + s², 0] = [s³ - 1, 0]`\n\n*   **Step 3: The matrix after the first round of reductions.**\n    After these operations, the set of rows generating the same module is equivalent to:\n    [ 0,         0   ]\n    [ s³ - 1,    0   ]\n    [ s,         0   ]\n    [ -s - 1,    1   ]\n\n    We can ignore the zero row. Let's reorder the non-zero rows for clarity:\n    [ -s - 1,    1   ]  (rA = R4)\n    [ s³ - 1,    0   ]  (rB = R2_new)\n    [ s,         0   ]  (rC = R3)\n\n*   **Step 4: Reduce the rows with zeros in the second column.**\n    We now have two rows, rB and rC, which have non-zero entries only in the first column. We can apply the standard Euclidean algorithm for scalar polynomials to their first elements: `s³ - 1` and `s`. We want to find `gcd(s³ - 1, s)`.\n    By polynomial division: `s³ - 1 = s² * (s) - 1`.\n    The remainder is -1. Thus, `gcd(s³ - 1, s) = gcd(s, -1) = 1`.\n    This means we can obtain a row `[1, 0]` by taking a suitable polynomial linear combination of rB and rC.\n    Specifically, `1 = s² * (s) - (s³ - 1)`.\n    So, `s² * rC - rB = s² * [s, 0] - [s³ - 1, 0] = [s³ - (s³ - 1), 0] = [1, 0]`.\n    Let's call this new row `rD = [1, 0]`.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final reduction.**\n    Our new set of generating rows is:\n    [ -s - 1,    1   ]  (rA)\n    [ 1,         0   ]  (rD)\n    (rB and rC are now redundant as they can be generated from rD).\n\n    Now, use rD to simplify rA.\n    `rA_new = rA + (s+1) * rD`\n    `rA_new = [-s - 1, 1] + (s+1) * [1, 0]`\n    `rA_new = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 + 0] = [0, 1]`\n    Let's call this new row `rE = [0, 1]`.\n\n*   **Step 6: The final result.**\n    The final simplified basis for the row space is given by the rows rD and rE.\n    rD = [1, 0]\n    rE = [0, 1]\n    Assembling these into a matrix gives the GCRD.\n\n    G(s) = [ 1, 0 ]\n           [ 0, 1 ]\n\nThis is the identity matrix, I.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the 2x2 identity matrix. When the GCRD is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the matrices P1 and P2 are said to be **right coprime**.\n\n>>> [1, 0; 0, 1]"
