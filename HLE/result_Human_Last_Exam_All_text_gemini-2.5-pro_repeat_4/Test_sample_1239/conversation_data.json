    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: The Equations of Motion\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$) describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. For a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ and a pressure field $p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, we have set the constant density $\\rho=1$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ is a non-zero constant. We consider the homogeneous case with no external forces. A symmetry of these equations is a transformation of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that maps any solution to another solution. The set of all such symmetries forms a Lie group, and its dimension is the number of independent parameters (or generators) needed to describe these transformations.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Symmetries and their Dimensions\n\nWe identify the continuous transformations that leave the equations invariant and count the number of independent generators for each.\n\n1.  **Time Translation (1-dimensional)**\n    The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$ (they are autonomous). This leads to a symmetry under time shifts:\n    $t \\rightarrow t' = t + \\epsilon_0$\n    This is a one-parameter group of transformations.\n    *Dimension = 1*\n\n2.  **Spatial Translations (3-dimensional)**\n    The equations have constant coefficients and are defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they are invariant under spatial shifts (translations):\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$\n    where $\\mathbf{a}$ is an arbitrary constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This gives three independent translations, one for each spatial direction.\n    *Dimension = 3*\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations (3-dimensional)**\n    The equations are written using vector calculus operators ($\\nabla, \\nabla^2, \\cdot$), which are invariant under rotations. The transformations are:\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$\n    $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$\n    where $R$ is a rotation matrix belonging to the special orthogonal group $SO(3)$. The group of rotations in 3D has three independent generators (e.g., rotations about the x, y, and z axes).\n    *Dimension = 3*\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts (3-dimensional)**\n    The equations obey the principle of Galilean relativity. A transformation to a coordinate system moving with a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$ is a symmetry:\n    $t \\rightarrow t' = t$\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t$\n    $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$\n    The constant boost velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$ is an arbitrary vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, providing three independent transformations.\n    *Dimension = 3*\n\n5.  **Scaling Transformation (1-dimensional)**\n    The Navier-Stokes equations possess a specific scaling (or dilation) symmetry. If $(\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t), p(\\mathbf{x}, t))$ is a solution, then so is the scaled version for any real parameter $\\alpha > 0$:\n    $t \\rightarrow t' = \\alpha^2 t$\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x}' = \\alpha \\mathbf{x}$\n    $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u}' = \\alpha^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$\n    $p \\rightarrow p' = \\alpha^{-2} p$\n    This is a one-parameter family of transformations. The specific exponents are fixed by the requirement that all terms in the momentum equation scale in the same way.\n    *Dimension = 1*\n\n### Step 3: Total Dimension Calculation\n\nThe total dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is the sum of the dimensions of all the independent symmetry groups identified above. This set of symmetries is known to be the complete (maximal) finite-dimensional symmetry group for the 3D case.\n\nTotal Dimension = (Time Translation) + (Space Translations) + (Rotations) + (Boosts) + (Scaling)\nTotal Dimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Equation Form:** The analysis assumes the homogeneous Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The presence of boundaries, external forces, or variable viscosity would reduce the number of symmetries.\n*   **Role of Viscosity:** The viscous term $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ is crucial. For the inviscid Euler equations ($\\nu=0$), the symmetry group is infinite-dimensional. The viscosity term breaks this larger group, leaving the finite-dimensional 11-parameter group.\n*   **Spatial Dimension:** The result is specific to $\\mathbb{R}^3$. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the symmetry group is infinite-dimensional even with viscosity, due to the vorticity equation having additional symmetries.\n*   **Pressure Transformation:** The pressure $p$ is a dependent variable whose transformation is determined by the requirement that the full system of equations remains invariant under the transformation of the other variables.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy systematically identifying all known continuous symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and summing their respective dimensions, we arrive at the total dimension of the corresponding Lie group.\n\n*   Time shifts: 1 parameter\n*   Space shifts: 3 parameters\n*   Rotations: 3 parameters\n*   Galilean boosts: 3 parameters\n*   Scaling: 1 parameter\n\nSumming these up: $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\n<<<11>>>"
