    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has a vertex set V with |V| = 5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices that preserves adjacency.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A graph G is 2-vertex-connected if it has at least 3 vertices, is connected, and remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. A vertex whose removal disconnects a connected graph is called a **cut vertex** or an **articulation point**. Therefore, a graph with 3 or more vertices is 2-vertex-connected if and only if it is connected and has no cut vertices.\n\n### **Step 2: Establish Key Properties and Strategy**\n\n1.  **Minimum Degree:** A necessary condition for a graph to be 2-vertex-connected is that the minimum degree of any vertex must be at least 2 (δ(G) ≥ 2). If a vertex `v` had degree 1, its only neighbor `u` would be a cut vertex (since removing `u` would isolate `v`). Our graphs have 5 vertices, so this condition applies.\n2.  **Minimum Edges:** For a graph on 5 vertices where every vertex has a degree of at least 2, the sum of degrees is at least 5 * 2 = 10. Since the sum of degrees is twice the number of edges (2m), we have 2m ≥ 10, which means m ≥ 5. So, we only need to search for graphs with 5 or more edges.\n3.  **Strategy:** We will enumerate all nonisomorphic simple graphs on 5 vertices, grouped by their number of edges (m), starting from m=5. For each graph, we will check if it meets the criteria: connected and has no cut vertices.\n\n### **Step 3: Systematic Enumeration and Analysis**\n\nThe maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\n*   **m = 5 edges:**\n    *   The only degree sequence for a graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges where all degrees are at least 2 is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n    *   The only connected graph with this degree sequence is the **Cycle graph C5**.\n    *   **Check:** C5 is connected. Removing any vertex results in a path P4, which is connected. Thus, C5 has no cut vertices.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **m = 6 edges:**\n    *   We look for connected graphs with 6 edges and min degree ≥ 2.\n    *   **Graph 1: C5 with one chord.** Adding an edge to C5 results in a graph with degree sequence (3, 3, 2, 2, 2). This graph is 2-connected (removing any vertex leaves a connected graph).\n    *   **Graph 2: The complete bipartite graph K2,3.** This graph also has 6 edges and degree sequence (3, 3, 2, 2, 2). It is not isomorphic to C5+chord because K2,3 contains no odd cycles (it's bipartite), while C5+chord contains triangles (C3). K2,3 is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **m = 7 edges:**\n    *   The number of nonisomorphic graphs with 7 edges is the same as the number with C(5,2) - 7 = 3 edges. There are 4 nonisomorphic graphs with 3 edges (P4 U K1, K1,3 U K1, C3 U 2K1, P3 U K2). We can analyze their complements.\n    *   A useful theorem: A vertex `v` is a cut vertex of a graph `G'` if and only if the induced subgraph on `V-v` of its complement, `G[V-v]`, is connected.\n    *   **Graph 1: Complement of P4 U K1.** Let G = P4({1,2,3,4}) U {5}. The subgraph G[V-{5}] is P4, which is connected. Therefore, vertex 5 is a cut vertex in the complement graph. Not 2-connected.\n    *   **Graph 2: Complement of K1,3 U K1.** This graph has a vertex of degree 1 and is thus not 2-connected.\n    *   **Graph 3: Complement of C3 U 2K1.** Let G = C3({1,2,3}) U {4,5}. For any vertex `v`, the subgraph G[V-v] is disconnected. For example, G[V-{4}] consists of a C3 and an isolated vertex. Since no G[V-v] is connected, the complement graph has no cut vertices. It is also connected. This graph is 2-connected.\n    *   **Graph 4: Complement of P3 U K2.** Let G = P3({1,2,3}) U K2({4,5}). For any vertex `v`, the subgraph G[V-v] is disconnected. Therefore, the complement graph has no cut vertices and is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **m = 8 edges:**\n    *   The number of graphs with 8 edges is the same as the number with 2 edges. There are 2 nonisomorphic graphs with 2 edges.\n    *   **Graph 1: Complement of P3 U 2K1.** Let G = P3({1,2,3}) U {4,5}. For any vertex `v`, the subgraph G[V-v] is disconnected. Therefore, the complement is 2-connected.\n    *   **Graph 2: Complement of 2K2 U K1.** Let G = 2K2({1,2},{3,4}) U {5}. For any vertex `v`, G[V-v] is disconnected. Therefore, the complement is 2-connected. (This graph is also known as the wheel graph W5).\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **m = 9 edges:**\n    *   The number of graphs with 9 edges is the same as the number with 1 edge. There is only 1 graph with 1 edge: K2 U 3K1.\n    *   **Graph 1: Complement of K2 U 3K1.** This is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). Removing any vertex leaves a connected subgraph (either K4 or K4-e). This graph is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **m = 10 edges:**\n    *   There is only one graph with 10 edges: the **complete graph K5**.\n    *   **Check:** K5 is 4-vertex-connected, which is greater than 2.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1 graph\n*   m=6: 2 graphs\n*   m=7: 2 graphs\n*   m=8: 2 graphs\n*   m=9: 1 graph\n*   m=10: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9.\n\nThere are 9 such graphs.\n\n<<<9>>>"
