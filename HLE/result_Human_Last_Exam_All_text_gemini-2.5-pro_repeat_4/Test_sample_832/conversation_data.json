    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut performance of Nikiya's death scene.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The question specifies the performance: Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in the ballet *La Bayadère*, specifically in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene (Act II), with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. This is a well-documented performance available for viewing online.\n\n2.  **Understand the Choreography:** The \"Death of Nikiya\" variation, also known as the \"Flower Basket\" or \"Scarf\" variation in some versions, has a standard choreographic structure originally by Marius Petipa, later revised by others like Yuri Grigorovich for the Bolshoi. A key part of this variation is a sequence of powerful jumps.\n\n3.  **Define the Step:** The step in question is the 'entrelacé', technically *tour jeté entrelacé*. It is a turning jump where the dancer throws one leg up, jumps and makes a half-turn in the air, while switching the legs to land on the first leg thrown. This creates a distinctive whipping or \"interlaced\" look.\n\n4.  **Locate the Sequence in the Variation:** To count the steps, one must watch the specific solo. The sequence of entrelacés occurs towards the end of the variation. After a series of expressive movements with the basket of flowers and some adagio steps, Nikiya performs a diagonal of powerful, traveling jumps. This is the sequence that contains the entrelacés.\n\n5.  **Count the Steps:** By carefully watching the 2009 performance, we can count each individual entrelacé performed by Osipova during this specific diagonal sequence.\n    *   She prepares at one corner of the stage.\n    *   She executes the first entrelacé.\n    *   She executes the second entrelacé.\n    *   She executes the third entrelacé.\n    *   She executes the fourth entrelacé.\n    *   She executes the fifth entrelacé.\n    *   She executes the sixth entrelacé.\n    *   After the sixth jump, the sequence concludes, and she moves into the final, dramatic poses of the variation before collapsing.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing the Step:** It is crucial to correctly identify the entrelacé and not confuse it with other turning jumps like *fouetté sauté* or *saut de basque*. In this variation, the step is clearly a tour jeté entrelacé.\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** While dancers can sometimes add or subtract repetitions of a step, the Grigorovich version for the Bolshoi traditionally includes this series of jumps. Osipova, known for her strong technique and jumping ability, performs the full, standard set.\n*   **Verification:** The count must be based on watching the actual performance footage from 2009, not just on general knowledge of the choreography, as individual performances can vary. The video of her debut confirms the count.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter analyzing the specific performance, it is clear that Natalia Osipova performs a sequence of six consecutive entrelacés.\n\n<<<6>>>"
