    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (the square in front of the Pantheon).\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed by the city administration.\"\n    *   **Timeframe:** The removal happened \"in 1950.\"\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Research Strategy:**\n    *   The most famous features of the square are the Pantheon itself and the Fontana del Pantheon (the fountain with the obelisk). Neither of these was removed.\n    *   The question mentions an \"architectural feature.\" This could be part of a building, a structure in the square, or even infrastructure.\n    *   The date, 1950, is a crucial clue. It points to post-WWII modernization efforts that were common in many European cities. This often involved changes to transportation infrastructure.\n\n3.  **Careful Points and Elimination of Incorrect Answers:**\n    *   **The Pantheon's Bell Towers:** A very common point of confusion is the pair of bell towers that were added to the Pantheon's facade by Bernini in the 17th century. They were mockingly called \"the donkey's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino). However, these were removed much earlier, in 1883, not 1950. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n    *   **The Fountain:** The Fontana del Pantheon, designed by Giacomo Della Porta with the obelisk added later, is a permanent fixture and was not removed in 1950.\n    *   **Surrounding Buildings:** While buildings change over time, there was no major removal of a unique architectural building or feature from the perimeter of the square in 1950.\n\n4.  **Focusing on the 1950 Timeframe and Infrastructure:**\n    *   Investigating the history of Rome's public transport reveals that the city had an extensive tram network in the first half of the 20th century.\n    *   Historical photographs from the 1920s, 30s, and 40s clearly show tram tracks running directly through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    *   This was indeed a unique feature: the tram line made a complete loop *around* the central fountain, allowing trams to turn around in the square. This created a very distinctive, circular track in the heart of the historic piazza.\n    *   Following World War II, Rome's city administration began dismantling many tram lines in the historic center to ease traffic congestion and make way for buses and cars. The line through Piazza della Rotonda was one of those decommissioned, and the tracks were paved over around 1950.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe unique architectural feature that existed in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal in 1950 was the circular tramway track that looped around the central fountain.\n\n<<<The circular tramway track>>>"
