    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct verses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the specific range of verses (*abyat*, singular: *bayt*) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are listed.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Poem and its Structure**\nThe poem is *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. It is a foundational text on Islamic creed, structured as a short poem for easy memorization. It covers the pillars of faith (*Iman*), including the belief in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and Divine Decree. The section on the Messengers is where we expect to find the list of prophets.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Section on the Prophets**\nBefore listing the prophets by name, the author first establishes the obligation to know them. This is a key point to identify the starting verse. The verse preceding the list states that a detailed account of 25 prophets is binding upon every accountable person. In standard editions of the poem, this is **bayt 29**:\n\n> **تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ ... كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ**\n> (A detailed account of twenty-five is binding... upon every accountable person, so verify and take this gain.)\n\nThis verse acts as an introduction to the list, but it does not contain any names itself. Therefore, the listing must begin in the very next verse.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Starting Verse of the List**\nThe verse immediately following the introduction (bayt 29) is **bayt 30**. This verse begins listing the prophets, starting with Adam (عليه السلام).\n\n> **هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ ... صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ**\n> (They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with... Salih and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.)\n\nThis is definitively the start of the list.\n\n**Step 5: Follow the List to Find the Ending Verse**\nWe must now follow the sequence of verses until the last prophet's name is mentioned.\n\n*   **Bayt 31** continues the list:\n    > **لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ... يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى**\n    > (Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, as well as... Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub, follow their example.)\n\n*   **Bayt 32** continues the list:\n    > **شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ... ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ**\n    > (Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, and al-Yasa'... Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.)\n\n*   **Bayt 33** concludes the list:\n    > **إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا**\n    > (Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya... 'Isa and Taha [a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ], the Seal; leave misguidance.)\n\nThe last name mentioned is **Taha (طه)**, which refers to the final prophet, Muhammad (ﷺ). This verse completes the list of 25 prophets.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the End of the List**\nTo confirm that the list ends at bayt 33, we examine the next verse, **bayt 34**:\n\n> **عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ ... وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الأَيَّامُ**\n> (Upon them be peace and blessings... and upon their families, as long as the days endure.)\n\nThis verse gives a general blessing upon all the prophets mentioned and their families. It does not introduce any new names, confirming that the list concluded in the previous verse.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** The numbering of the *abyat* can sometimes vary slightly between different prints, but the range of verses for the prophets is consistently these four specific couplets. The numbering used here (starting the list at 30 and ending at 33) is the most standard and widely accepted.\n2.  **Introductory Verse:** It is important not to include the verse that mentions the *number* of prophets (bayt 29) as part of the list itself, as the question asks for the verses where the *names* are mentioned.\n3.  **Concluding Verse:** It is also important not to include the verse that sends blessings upon the prophets (bayt 34) in the final range, as it does not list any names.\n4.  **\"Taha\":** The name used for Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) in the poem is \"Taha\", which is one of his names/titles derived from the opening letters of Surah Taha in the Qur'an.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe names of the prophets in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* are mentioned starting from **bayt 30** and ending at **bayt 33**.\n\n<<<From bayt 30 to bayt 33>>>"
