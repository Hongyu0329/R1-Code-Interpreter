    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Board and Attacks**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. We can represent the squares with coordinates `(r, c)` where `r, c` are integers from 0 to 4.\n*   **Toroidal Attacks:** Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if any of the following conditions are met (all arithmetic is modulo 5):\n    1.  `r1 = r2` (same row)\n    2.  `c1 = c2` (same column)\n    3.  `r1 - c1 = r2 - c2` (same main diagonal)\n    4.  `r1 + c1 = r2 + c2` (same anti-diagonal)\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the number of ways to choose 4 distinct squares `(r_i, c_i)` for `i=1,2,3,4` such that no two queens attack each other. This means for any pair of queens, all four conditions above must be false. Consequently, the 4 rows (`r_i`), 4 columns (`c_i`), 4 main diagonals (`r_i - c_i`), and 4 anti-diagonals (`r_i + c_i`) must all be distinct sets of values.\n\n**Step 2: Using Symmetry to Simplify the Problem**\n\nThe toroidal board has a high degree of symmetry. Any arrangement can be translated to 24 other unique positions (since the board has 25 squares). We can simplify the problem by first fixing the position of one queen and then multiplying the result appropriately.\n\nLet's fix the first queen, Q1, at the square `(0, 0)`.\nThe total number of solutions `W` can be found using the formula:\n`W = (Number of solutions with a queen at (0,0)) * 25 / 4`\nThis formula works because each unique configuration of 4 queens will be counted 4 times (once for each queen being hypothetically \"fixed\" at `(0,0)` by a translation), and there are 25 possible starting squares. This relies on the fact that no 4-queen configuration on a 5x5 toroidal board has translational symmetry, which is true because the size of any translational orbit (5) does not divide the number of queens (4).\n\n**Step 3: Finding Available Squares for the Remaining Queens**\n\nWith Q1 at `(0,0)`, the other three queens cannot be placed on:\n*   Row 0: `r = 0`\n*   Column 0: `c = 0`\n*   Main Diagonal: `r - c = 0 (mod 5)`, which means `r = c`\n*   Anti-Diagonal: `r + c = 0 (mod 5)`, which means `r = -c` or `r = 5-c`\n\nWe need to find the squares `(r, c)` where `r, c âˆˆ {1, 2, 3, 4}` that do not satisfy `r = c` or `r = 5-c`.\nLet's list them:\n*   For `r=1`: `c` cannot be 1 or 4. Allowed `c` are 2, 3. Squares: `(1,2), (1,3)`.\n*   For `r=2`: `c` cannot be 2 or 3. Allowed `c` are 1, 4. Squares: `(2,1), (2,4)`.\n*   For `r=3`: `c` cannot be 3 or 2. Allowed `c` are 1, 4. Squares: `(3,1), (3,4)`.\n*   For `r=4`: `c` cannot be 4 or 1. Allowed `c` are 2, 3. Squares: `(4,2), (4,3)`.\n\nThis gives us a set `S` of 8 available squares for the remaining 3 queens:\n`S = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3)}`\n\n**Step 4: Counting Non-Attacking Arrangements of 3 Queens on the Available Squares**\n\nWe need to choose 3 squares from `S` such that no two attack each other. Let's analyze the attack relationships within `S`. We can think of this as finding an independent set of size 3 in a graph where the 8 squares are vertices and an edge connects two squares if they are on the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nLet's partition the 8 squares into two sets:\n*   `A = {(1,2), (2,4), (3,1), (4,3)}`\n*   `B = {(1,3), (2,1), (3,4), (4,2)}`\n\nLet's test for attacks within set `A`:\n*   Take `(1,2)` and `(2,4)`: rows (1,2), cols (2,4), diags (4,3), anti-diags (3,1). No attack.\n*   A full check reveals that no two squares within set `A` attack each other. `A` is an independent set.\n\nLet's test for attacks within set `B`:\n*   A full check reveals that no two squares within set `B` attack each other. `B` is an independent set.\n\nNow let's check for attacks between a square in `A` and a square in `B`:\n*   Take `(1,2)` from `A`.\n    *   vs `(1,3)` in `B`: attack (same row 1).\n    *   vs `(2,1)` in `B`: attack (same anti-diag `r+c=3`).\n    *   vs `(3,4)` in `B`: attack (same main diag `r-c=4`).\n    *   vs `(4,2)` in `B`: attack (same col 2).\nSo, `(1,2)` attacks all squares in `B`. A full analysis shows that every square in `A` attacks every square in `B`. The graph of attacking relationships between these 8 squares is a complete bipartite graph `K_4,4` with partitions `A` and `B`.\n\nAn independent set of vertices in a complete bipartite graph must be entirely contained within one of the partitions. We need to find an independent set of size 3.\n*   We can choose 3 squares from set `A`. The number of ways is `C(4, 3) = 4`.\n*   We can choose 3 squares from set `B`. The number of ways is `C(4, 3) = 4`.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to place the 3 non-attacking queens on the 8 available squares is `4 + 4 = 8`. This means there are 8 solutions that include a queen at `(0,0)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2:\n`W = (Number of solutions with a queen at (0,0)) * 25 / 4`\n`W = 8 * 25 / 4`\n`W = 200 / 4`\n`W = 50`\n\nAlternative Method Confirmation:\nIt is a known result in combinatorics that every configuration of 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board can be extended to a configuration of 5 non-attacking queens. The number of 5-queen solutions on a 5x5 toroidal board is 10. From each 5-queen solution, we can obtain `C(5, 4) = 5` different 4-queen solutions by removing one queen. Since any two 5-queen solutions intersect at most at one point, all these generated 4-queen solutions are unique. This gives a total of `10 * 5 = 50` solutions, confirming the result.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
