    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Mathematical Objects and the Goal\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** This is a finite set of points, say $X = \\{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\\}$, equipped with a distance function $d(p_i, p_j)$ that satisfies the following conditions for all points $x, y, z \\in X$:\n    1.  $d(x, y) \\ge 0$ (non-negativity)\n    2.  $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$ (identity of indiscernibles)\n    3.  $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ (symmetry)\n    4.  $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ (strong triangle inequality or ultrametric inequality). This is a stronger condition than the usual triangle inequality.\n\n*   **Banach Space (B):** This is a vector space (over the real or complex numbers) with a norm $\\| \\cdot \\|$, which is complete with respect to the metric induced by the norm, $d(u, v) = \\|u - v\\|$. The \"cardinality $K$\" simply refers to the number of points in the space $B$. For any non-zero Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, this cardinality is infinite. The trivial space $\\{0\\}$ is a Banach space of cardinality $K=1$.\n\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** This is a function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances. For every pair of points $p_i, p_j \\in X$, the distance between their images in $B$ must be equal to their distance in $X$. Mathematically, this means:\n    $\\|f(p_i) - f(p_j)\\|_B = d_X(p_i, p_j)$.\n    A key property of an isometry is that it must be injective (one-to-one). If $f(p_i)=f(p_j)$, then $\\|f(p_i)-f(p_j)\\|=0$, which implies $d_X(p_i,p_j)=0$, and thus $p_i=p_j$.\n\n*   **The Goal:** The question asks for the \"smallest possible number\" of such isometric embeddings. This means we need to consider all possible finite ultrametric spaces $X$ and all possible Banach spaces $B$, count the number of embeddings for each pair $(X, B)$, and find the minimum among all these counts.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Number of Embeddings\n\nLet $N(X, B)$ be the number of isometric embeddings from $X$ into $B$. Since $N(X, B)$ is a count of functions, it must be a non-negative integer ($0, 1, 2, ...$). The smallest possible value this number can take is therefore at least 0.\n\nTo find the minimum, we can ask: Is it possible for $N(X, B)$ to be 0? If we can find even one pair $(X, B)$ for which there are no isometric embeddings, then the minimum possible number is 0.\n\n### Step 3: Construct an Example with Zero Embeddings\n\nLet's try to find a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ such that $X$ cannot be isometrically embedded into $B$.\n\n1.  **Choose a specific finite ultrametric space (X):**\n    Consider a space $X$ with three points, $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$, where the distance between any two distinct points is 1. So, $d(p_1, p_2) = 1$, $d(p_2, p_3) = 1$, and $d(p_1, p_3) = 1$.\n    *   **Careful point:** We must verify this is an ultrametric space. We need to check the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$. For our space, this means checking $1 \\le \\max(1, 1)$, which is true. So, $X$ is a valid finite ultrametric space.\n\n2.  **Choose a specific Banach space (B):**\n    Let's choose a simple, well-known Banach space. Let $B$ be the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, with the standard norm $\\|v\\| = |v|$. The induced metric is the usual distance $d(a, b) = |a - b|$. $\\mathbb{R}$ is a complete normed vector space, so it is a Banach space.\n\n3.  **Attempt to find an isometric embedding:**\n    Suppose an isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ exists. Let the images of the points be $x_1 = f(p_1)$, $x_2 = f(p_2)$, and $x_3 = f(p_3)$. According to the definition of an isometric embedding, the distances must be preserved:\n    *   $|x_1 - x_2| = d(p_1, p_2) = 1$\n    *   $|x_2 - x_3| = d(p_2, p_3) = 1$\n    *   $|x_1 - x_3| = d(p_1, p_3) = 1$\n\n4.  **Check for contradiction:**\n    The points $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are on the real line. Let's order them, for instance, $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$. (The argument holds for any other ordering).\n    *   From $x_1 < x_2$, the condition $|x_1 - x_2| = 1$ becomes $x_2 - x_1 = 1$.\n    *   From $x_2 < x_3$, the condition $|x_2 - x_3| = 1$ becomes $x_3 - x_2 = 1$.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the distance between $x_1$ and $x_3$. Using the properties of real numbers:\n        $|x_1 - x_3| = x_3 - x_1 = (x_3 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   This result, $|x_1 - x_3| = 2$, directly contradicts the required condition that $|x_1 - x_3| = 1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of the example:**\n    The assumption that an isometric embedding exists leads to a contradiction. Therefore, no such embedding of our chosen space $X$ into $\\mathbb{R}$ can exist. For this specific pair $(X, B)$, the number of isometric embeddings is $N(X, B) = 0$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have found an example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0. Since the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, and we have shown that the number can be 0, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\n*   **Careful point on cardinality K:** The problem mentions a \"Banach space of cardinality K\". Our choice $B=\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $K=\\mathfrak{c}$ (the continuum). The argument works. We could also choose $B=\\{0\\}$ (cardinality $K=1$) and try to embed any $X$ with more than one point and non-zero distance, which also results in 0 embeddings. The specific value of $K$ does not change the fact that 0 is an achievable number.\n\n<<<0>>>"
