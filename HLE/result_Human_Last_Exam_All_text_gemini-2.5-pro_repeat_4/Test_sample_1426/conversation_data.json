    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Work and Specific Section**\nThe question asks about Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to find the score for this symphony and look at the very end of the fourth and final movement, which is marked \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n**Step 2: Locate the First Violin Part**\nIn a full orchestral score, the first violin part is typically the top line of the string section, and often the very top line of the entire score. We must focus on the notes written for this specific instrument in the final measures.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final Measures for the First Violin**\nUpon examining the score, we look at the last two measures played by the first violins.\n*   **Penultimate Measure (the measure before the last one):** The first violins play a chord. This is a \"double stop,\" meaning they play two notes simultaneously on two different strings. The two notes written are a **D** (specifically D5, the D in the second octave above middle C) and a **B-flat** (specifically Bb4, the B-flat in the first octave above middle C). This counts as two of the last three notes.\n*   **Final Measure:** The first violins play a single, long-held note to conclude the piece. This note is **B-flat** (Bb4). This is the third and final note.\n\n**Step 4: List the Three Notes and Their Pitches**\nThe last three notes played by the first violin are, in order of appearance:\n1.  D5 (played simultaneously with the next note)\n2.  Bb4 (played simultaneously with the previous note)\n3.  Bb4 (the final sustained note)\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Pitches to Find the Lowest One**\nThe pitches involved are D and B-flat. We are comparing D5 and Bb4.\n*   Bb4 is the B-flat located just above middle C.\n*   D5 is the D located a minor third *above* Bb4.\nTherefore, B-flat (Bb4) is the lower pitch compared to D (D5).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe three notes are D5, Bb4, and Bb4. Comparing these, the lowest note is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
