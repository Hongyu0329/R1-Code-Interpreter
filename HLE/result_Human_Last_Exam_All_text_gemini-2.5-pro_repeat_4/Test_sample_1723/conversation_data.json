    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific mushroom **genus**. The defining characteristic provided is that it is the **only one known** to produce a **distinctly blue spore print**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand \"Spore Print\"**\nA spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology. It is made by placing a mushroom cap, gills or pores down, on a surface (often paper) and allowing its microscopic spores to fall and create a visible deposit. The color of this deposit is a key taxonomic feature and is generally consistent at the genus level, though with some exceptions.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Spore Print Colors**\nMost mushroom spore prints fall into a common range of colors:\n*   **White/Cream:** Very common (e.g., *Amanita*, *Lepiota*, *Tricholoma*)\n*   **Pink/Salmon:** (e.g., *Pluteus*, most *Entoloma*)\n*   **Brown:** A wide range from yellowish-brown to rusty-brown to dark chocolate brown (e.g., *Cortinarius*, *Galerina*, *Agaricus*)\n*   **Black/Purple-Brown:** (e.g., *Coprinellus*, *Panaeolus*, *Stropharia*, *Psilocybe*)\n*   **Ochres/Yellows:** (e.g., *Hebeloma*)\n*   **Olive:** (e.g., many Boletes)\n\nA blue spore print is exceptionally rare, which is why the question specifies it's a unique characteristic of a single genus.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Genus**\nResearching mushroom genera with unusual spore colors quickly points to the genus *Entoloma*. While the vast majority of species in this large and diverse genus have a characteristic angular spore shape and produce a pink spore print, a small and distinct group within *Entoloma* is famous for producing blue spores.\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing Spore Print from Bruising Color.** Many mushrooms, such as those in the genus *Psilocybe* (magic mushrooms) or many species of *Boletus*, bruise or stain blue when handled or damaged. However, this is a chemical reaction in the mushroom's flesh and is completely different from the color of its spores. *Psilocybe* species have a purple-brown to black spore print, and boletes typically have an olive-brown spore print. The question is specifically about the **spore print**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Not all species in the genus have this trait.** It is critical to note that only a fraction of species within the genus *Entoloma* produce blue spores. This group is often classified within the section *Cyanula*. However, the question asks for the **genus** that is known to have this capability, and *Entoloma* is the only one.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Shade of Blue.** The \"blue\" color of the spore print can range from a sky-blue to a grayish-blue or greenish-blue. It is nonetheless a distinct blue color, unlike any other spore prints.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Confirmation of \"Single Genus\".** Mycology literature confirms that, to date, *Entoloma* remains the only known genus of gilled mushrooms that contains species with a true blue spore print, making it a unique and defining feature for that specific subgroup.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the genus in question.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  The question asks for a single genus of mushroom.\n2.  The unique identifier is a \"distinctly blue spore print\".\n3.  Standard mushroom spore print colors do not include blue, making this feature extremely rare.\n4.  The genus *Entoloma* is widely cited in mycological resources as the sole genus containing species that produce blue spores.\n5.  While most *Entoloma* species have pink spores, the genus as a whole is the only one known to produce this blue variant.\n\nThe name of the genus is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
