    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question:**\n    *   **\"Tonic chord\":** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It is the chord built on the first note of the scale and is designated by the Roman numeral 'I' in a major key or 'i' in a minor key. For example, in the key of A minor, the tonic chord is A minor (Am).\n    *   **\"Minor fifth chord\":** This refers to the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale, which is a minor chord. This is designated by the Roman numeral 'v'.\n    *   **\"Chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\":** This means the song's opening progression is i -> v (in a minor key) or I -> v (in a major key).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:**\n    *   In a **minor key**, this progression is quite natural. For example, in the key of A minor, the scale is A-B-C-D-E-F-G. The tonic chord (i) is A minor (A-C-E). The fifth degree is E, and the chord built on it is E minor (E-G-B). So, the progression is **Am -> Em**.\n    *   In a **major key**, the chord on the fifth degree (the dominant) is naturally major (V). A minor fifth (v) would be a \"borrowed\" chord, typically from the parallel minor key, creating a more melancholic sound. For example, in G major, the progression would be **G -> Dm**.\n\n3.  **Search Through the Beatles' Discography:** We need to find a song that begins with this specific i -> v (or I -> v) progression.\n\n    *   Let's consider songs in minor keys first, as the i -> v progression is more common.\n    *   A prime candidate is the song **\"Things We Said Today\"** from the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n    *   **Key:** The song is in the key of A minor.\n    *   **Tonic (i):** The tonic chord is A minor (Am).\n    *   **Minor Fifth (v):** The fifth degree of A minor is E. The minor chord on this note is E minor (Em).\n    *   **Introduction and Verse:** The song starts with a few stark, anticipatory strums of the A minor chord. Then, the first line of the verse begins:\n        *   \"You say...\" is sung over the **A minor** (i) chord.\n        *   \"...you will love me...\" is sung over the **E minor** (v) chord.\n    *   This represents a clear and immediate jump from the tonic (i) to the minor fifth (v) right at the start of the song's main theme.\n\n4.  **Verify Against Other Songs:**\n    *   \"Michelle\" (in F minor) starts on the tonic (Fm) but moves to C#maj7 and then C7 (V), not Cm (v).\n    *   \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" (in A minor) starts with a descending bassline over an Am chord (Am -> Am/G -> D/F#), not a jump to Em.\n    *   \"Eleanor Rigby\" (in E minor) starts on a C major chord (VI), not the tonic.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe song \"Things We Said Today\" is in the key of A minor. It begins with an introductory A minor chord (the tonic, i), and the first chord change in the verse is to E minor (the minor fifth, v). This perfectly matches the description given in the question.\n\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
