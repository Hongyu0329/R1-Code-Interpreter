    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**1. Analyze the Integral and Identify the Dominant Contribution**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nWe are interested in the behavior of this integral for small positive values of $\\epsilon$ (i.e., as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + p(x)$, where $p(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$.\n\nThe integrand $\\frac{1}{D(x, \\epsilon)}$ will become very large if the denominator $D(x, \\epsilon)$ becomes very small. This occurs when $p(x)$ is close to zero. We need to find the points where $p(x)=0$ within the integration interval $[0, 15.00]$.\n\nThe polynomial can be factored as $p(x) = x^{5.0}(9.0 + 5.0 x + 9.0 x^{3.0})$.\nFor $x > 0$, the term $(9.0 + 5.0 x + 9.0 x^{3.0})$ is always positive. Therefore, $p(x) > 0$ for $x \\in (0, 15.00]$.\nAt the lower limit of integration, $x=0$, we have $p(0) = 0$.\n\nThis means the denominator approaches $\\epsilon$ as $x \\to 0$. For small $\\epsilon$, the integrand becomes very large in a small neighborhood around $x=0$. This region near $x=0$ will provide the dominant contribution to the integral.\n\n**2. Approximate the Integrand for Small x**\n\nSince the dominant contribution comes from the region where $x$ is small, we can approximate the polynomial $p(x)$ by its leading term for $x \\to 0$.\nThe term with the lowest power of $x$ is $9.0 x^{5.0}$.\nSo, for small $x$, we have the approximation:\n$p(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0} \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$\n\nThe integral can then be approximated as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n**3. Extend the Integration Limit**\n\nThe value of the approximated integral is determined by the behavior of the integrand for small $x$, where $\\epsilon$ and $9.0x^{5.0}$ are comparable. For larger $x$ (e.g., $x=15.00$), the term $9.0x^{5.0}$ is much larger than $\\epsilon$, and the contribution to the integral is small.\nThis allows us to extend the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ without significantly changing the leading-order behavior of the integral. The error introduced by this extension is of a lower order in $\\epsilon$ than the dominant term we are seeking.\nSo, our approximation becomes:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n**4. Evaluate the Approximate Integral**\n\nWe can solve this integral using a change of variables. Let's make a substitution to simplify the denominator.\nLet $t = \\frac{9.0 x^{5.0}}{\\epsilon}$. This implies $x^{5.0} = \\frac{\\epsilon t}{9.0}$.\nTaking the fifth root, we get $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} t^{1/5}$.\nNow, we find the differential $dx$:\n$dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} t^{-4/5} dt$.\n\nThe limits of integration for $t$ are:\n- When $x=0$, $t=0$.\n- When $x \\to \\infty$, $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nNow substitute these into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon t} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} \\frac{1}{5} t^{-4/5} \\right] dt$\nFactor out $\\epsilon$ from the denominator:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1 + t)} \\left[ \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9.0^{1/5}} \\frac{1}{5} t^{-4/5} \\right] dt$\n\nNow, group the terms involving $\\epsilon$ and the constants:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{\\epsilon \\cdot 5 \\cdot 9.0^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{-4/5}}{1+t} dt$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9.0^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{-4/5}}{1+t} dt$\n\n**5. Use the Beta Function to Evaluate the Final Integral**\n\nThe remaining integral is a standard integral representation of the Beta function:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{z-1}}{1+u} du = B(z, 1-z)$\nwhere $B(z,w)$ is the Beta function. This integral is also related to the Gamma function $\\Gamma(z)$ by the formula:\n$B(z, 1-z) = \\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$\n\nIn our case, the exponent of $t$ is $-4/5$. We set $z-1 = -4/5$, which gives $z = 1 - 4/5 = 1/5$.\nSo, the value of our integral is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{-4/5}}{1+t} dt = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Formula**\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9.0^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\nThis gives the final analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThe exponent can also be written as a decimal: $-4/5 = -0.8$. The constant coefficient is $C = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$."
