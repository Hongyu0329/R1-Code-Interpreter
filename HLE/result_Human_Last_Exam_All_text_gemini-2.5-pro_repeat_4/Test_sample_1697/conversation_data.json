    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting compound is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring attached to a carboxamide group, -C(=O)N-.\n    *   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. This gives the -C(=O)N(C₂H₅)₂ group. This group is located at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n    *   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is attached to position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\n    The structure has two key functional groups on the benzene ring: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at C1 and the dimethylamino group at C3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step: Deprotonation (Lithiation)**\n    *   **Reagents:** `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) and `TMEDA` (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) in `THF` (tetrahydrofuran).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is standard for a **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base capable of removing a proton (deprotonation) directly from an aromatic ring. The site of deprotonation is directed by certain functional groups on the ring, known as Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs). `TMEDA` is a chelating agent that complexes with the lithium ion (Li⁺), breaking up sec-BuLi aggregates and increasing its reactivity. It also helps to stabilize the resulting aryllithium intermediate.\n    *   **Identifying the Directing Groups and the Site of Lithiation:** Both the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) are powerful DMGs. They direct the deprotonation to their adjacent (ortho) positions.\n        *   The -CONEt₂ group at C1 directs to positions C2 and C6.\n        *   The -NMe₂ group at C3 directs to positions C2 and C4.\n    *   **Cooperative Directing Effect:** The proton at the C2 position is *ortho to both directing groups*. This makes the C2 proton significantly more acidic than the protons at C4 (ortho to only -NMe₂) or C6 (ortho to only -CONEt₂). Furthermore, the lithium ion can be chelated by both the carbonyl oxygen of the amide and the nitrogen of the amino group, forming a stable six-membered ring-like transition state. This geometry strongly favors the abstraction of the proton at C2.\n    *   **Intermediate Product:** The reaction selectively removes the hydrogen atom from the C2 position and replaces it with a lithium atom, forming an aryllithium intermediate: **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step: Electrophilic Quench**\n    *   **Reagent:** `Methyl iodide` (CH₃I).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile, with a strong negative charge localized on the C2 carbon. Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The C2-Li bond will act as a carbanion and attack the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group.\n    *   **Transformation:** The lithium atom at C2 is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    The overall reaction sequence results in the regioselective substitution of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the starting material with a methyl group. The structure of the final product is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The most critical point is determining where the deprotonation occurs. The presence of two DMGs at positions 1 and 3 creates a highly activated C-H bond at position 2, leading to exceptional regioselectivity.\n*   **Reagent Roles:** It is important to understand the specific role of each reagent: `sec-BuLi` as the strong base, `TMEDA` as the activator/stabilizer, and `CH₃I` as the electrophile (methyl source).\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via a two-step sequence: 1) formation of a nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate through DoM, followed by 2) reaction of this intermediate with an electrophile.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
