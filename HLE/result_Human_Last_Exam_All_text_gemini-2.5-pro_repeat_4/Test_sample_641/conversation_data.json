    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We are asked to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group PSU(4, q)**\nLet $q=997$. The group is $G = \\text{PSU}(4, q) = \\text{SU}(4, q) / Z(\\text{SU}(4, q))$.\n-   $\\text{SU}(4, q)$ is the special unitary group, which consists of $4 \\times 4$ matrices $A$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that $A A^{*T} = I$ and $\\det(A) = 1$. Here $A^{*T}$ is the conjugate transpose, where conjugation is the Frobenius automorphism $x \\mapsto x^q$.\n-   $Z(\\text{SU}(4, q))$ is the center of $\\text{SU}(4, q)$. It consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^4 = 1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. The order of the center is $\\gcd(4, q+1)$.\n-   For $q=997$, the order of the center is $\\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\n-   Thus, the center is $Z = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate involutions in PSU(4, q) to elements in SU(4, q)**\nAn element $x \\in \\text{PSU}(4, q)$ is an involution if $x \\neq 1$ and $x^2 = 1$. Let $x = gZ$ where $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$ and $Z$ is the center.\n-   $x \\neq 1$ means $gZ \\neq Z$, which implies $g \\notin Z$.\n-   $x^2 = 1$ means $(gZ)^2 = Z$, which implies $g^2 Z = Z$, so $g^2 \\in Z$.\nSo, we need to count the number of cosets $gZ$ such that $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\setminus Z$ and $g^2 \\in Z$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the preimages in SU(4, q)**\nLet $S = \\{g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\setminus Z \\mid g^2 \\in Z\\}$. Since $Z=\\{I, -I\\}$, the condition $g^2 \\in Z$ means either $g^2=I$ or $g^2=-I$.\nLet $T_1 = \\{g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\mid g^2=I\\}$ and $T_2 = \\{g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\mid g^2=-I\\}$.\nThe set $S$ consists of elements from $T_1$ and $T_2$ that are not in the center $Z$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the set $T_2 = \\{g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\mid g^2=-I\\}$**\nLet $g \\in T_2$. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $g$, then $\\lambda^2=-1$. As $g$ is a unitary matrix, its eigenvalues must also satisfy the condition $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$.\nFrom $\\lambda^2=-1$, we have $\\lambda^{q+1} = (\\lambda^2)^{(q+1)/2} = (-1)^{(q+1)/2}$.\nFor this to be 1, $(q+1)/2$ must be an even integer. This means $q+1$ must be a multiple of 4, or $q \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\nIn our case, $q = 997$. We have $997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1$, so $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nFor $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, $(q+1)/2$ is odd, so $\\lambda^{q+1}=-1$. This contradicts the condition $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$.\nTherefore, for $q=997$, there are no matrices in $\\text{U}(4, q)$ (and thus in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$) such that $g^2=-I$.\nSo, $T_2$ is empty.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the set $T_1 = \\{g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\mid g^2=I\\}$**\nThese are elements of order 1 or 2. An element $g$ with $g^2=I$ is diagonalizable, with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. Let the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 1 be $k$. The eigenvalues are $(1, ..., 1, -1, ..., -1)$.\nThe determinant is $(-1)^{4-k}$. Since $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$, we must have $\\det(g)=1$. This implies $4-k$ must be even. Possible values for $k$ are $0, 2, 4$.\n-   **k=4:** The eigenvalues are $(1,1,1,1)$. This corresponds to the identity matrix, $g=I$. There is 1 such element.\n-   **k=0:** The eigenvalues are $(-1,-1,-1,-1)$. This corresponds to the matrix $g=-I$. There is 1 such element.\n-   **k=2:** The eigenvalues are $(1,1,-1,-1)$. These are the true involutions that are not in the center. These elements form a single conjugacy class in $\\text{SU}(4,q)$. The size of this class is given by $|C| = \\frac{|\\text{SU}(4, q)|}{|C_{\\text{SU}(4, q)}(g)|}$, where $g$ is a representative of the class.\n    The centralizer of such an element $g$ in $\\text{U}(4, q)$ is isomorphic to $\\text{U}(2, q) \\times \\text{U}(2, q)$. The size of the centralizer in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$ is $(q+1)|\\text{SU}(2, q)|^2$.\n    The size of the conjugacy class is:\n    $|C| = \\frac{|\\text{SU}(4, q)|}{(q+1)|\\text{SU}(2, q)|^2} = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)$.\nSo, the total number of elements in $T_1$ is $1+1+|C| = 2 + q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the number of involutions in PSU(4, q)**\nThe set of preimages of involutions is $S = \\{g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q) \\setminus Z \\mid g^2 \\in Z\\}$.\nSince $T_2$ is empty, we only need to consider $g^2=I$.\n$S = \\{g \\in T_1 \\mid g \\notin Z\\}$.\nThe elements in $T_1$ are $I$, $-I$, and the elements of the class $C$. Both $I$ and $-I$ are in the center $Z$.\nSo $S$ is precisely the set of elements in the conjugacy class $C$.\n$|S| = |C| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)$.\nThe number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4, q)$ is the number of distinct cosets $gZ$ with $g \\in S$.\nFor any $g \\in S$, we have $g \\neq -g$ (since $g$ is not the zero matrix and the characteristic is not 2). Also, if $g \\in S=C$, then $-g$ is also in $C$ (as it has the same eigenvalues). So the coset $gZ = \\{g, -g\\}$ consists of two distinct elements from $S$.\nTherefore, the number of involutions is $|S|/|Z| = |S|/2$.\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)$.\n\n**Step 7: Compute the final value for q=997**\nWe substitute $q=997$ into the formula:\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (997^2+1) \\cdot (997^2-997+1)$.\n-   $q = 997$\n-   $q^2 = 997^2 = 994009$\n-   $q^4 = (994009)^2 = 988053848081$\n-   $q^2+1 = 994010$\n-   $q^2-q+1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013$\n\nNumber = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 988053848081 \\cdot 994010 \\cdot 993013$\nNumber = $988053848081 \\cdot 497005 \\cdot 993013$\nNumber = $988053848081 \\cdot (497005 \\cdot 993013)$\nNumber = $988053848081 \\cdot 493536835065$\nNumber = $486791173602998635483082305$"
