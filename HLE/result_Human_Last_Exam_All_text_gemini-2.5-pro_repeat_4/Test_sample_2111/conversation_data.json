    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Key Figure:** Fernand Braudel, a renowned historian known for his emphasis on large-scale, long-term history (*la longue dur√©e*) and global perspectives.\n    *   **Quoted Figure:** Paul Morand, a French author and diplomat.\n    *   **Core Metaphor:** Something \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\" A sphere is a three-dimensional representation of a globe, symbolizing totality and a worldwide scope.\n    *   **Subject of the Metaphor:** A \"particular conceptual entity.\"\n    *   **Clarifying Example:** This entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This part is slightly tricky. It suggests that while a nation is an example, the entity itself is something broader that contains or frames the nation.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:**\n    *   The reference comes from the preface to Fernand Braudel's major work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*, specifically in the first volume, *The Structures of Everyday Life*.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Context of the Quote:**\n    *   In the preface, Braudel argues against the limitations of traditional, event-focused history that centers on the nation-state. He advocates for a \"total history\" that considers geography, economics, and social structures over long periods and across the entire globe.\n    *   He discusses the difficulty of defining what a \"country\" or \"nation\" is in historical terms. To make his point about the need for a broader perspective, he brings in Paul Morand.\n\n4.  **Identify the Exact Quote:**\n    *   Braudel first quotes Morand as saying, \"to be of one's country is by all means to be of one's time.\" He then introduces the key quote for our question.\n    *   The direct quote from Paul Morand that Braudel uses is: **\"A history of the world is a history that has to be written as if inscribed on a sphere.\"**\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Interpret:**\n    *   The \"conceptual entity\" that must be inscribed on the sphere (the globe) is **\"a history of the world.\"**\n    *   The phrase in the question, \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation,\" refers to Braudel's argument. He is saying that to properly understand the history of any single part (like a nation), you must place it within the context of the whole (the world). Therefore, the history of a nation is an example that demonstrates the need for this global, \"spherical\" approach. The entity being inscribed is not the nation itself, but the all-encompassing history that gives the nation its meaning.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe conceptual entity that Braudel, quoting Morand, argues should be inscribed within a sphere is a history of the world. This approach is necessary to understand any component part of that history, such as the history of a single nation.\n\n<<<A history of the world>>>"
