    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The noble gases are a group of chemical elements in group 18 of the periodic table. They are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is also a noble gas, but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally and is therefore not considered in this context.\n\n2.  **Understand the Scope: \"Rarest on Earth\"**: The question specifies the abundance on Earth (\"terrestrial matter\"), not in the universe. The abundance of elements on Earth is very different from their cosmic abundance. The question also specifies \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter,\" which means we should consider the total mass of each noble gas relative to the total mass of the Earth (atmosphere, oceans, crust, mantle, core).\n\n3.  **Consider the Main Reservoir of Noble Gases on Earth**: For all noble gases except Radon and some Helium, the primary reservoir on Earth is the atmosphere. Their concentrations in the crust and oceans are extremely low in comparison. Therefore, comparing their atmospheric abundances is a very effective way to determine their relative rarity.\n\n4.  **List the Abundances of Noble Gases in Earth's Atmosphere**: The approximate abundances of noble gases in dry air by volume are:\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% (9,340 parts per million, ppm)\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** ~0.0018% (18.18 ppm)\n    *   **Helium (He):** ~0.00052% (5.24 ppm)\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** ~0.00011% (1.14 ppm)\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.0000087% (0.087 ppm or 87 parts per billion, ppb)\n    *   **Radon (Rn):** Extremely low and variable. Its concentration is on the order of 1 part in 10^21, which is about 1 x 10^-19 ppm.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Data**:\n    *   From the atmospheric data alone, we can see a clear trend of decreasing abundance. Argon is the most abundant, followed by Neon, Helium, Krypton, and Xenon.\n    *   Radon's concentration is orders of magnitude lower than any other noble gas.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the \"Careful Points\"**:\n    *   **Radioactivity of Radon**: Radon is the rarest because it is a radioactive element with a very short half-life (the most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days). It is continuously produced by the radioactive decay of radium (which itself comes from the decay of uranium) in the Earth's crust, but it also decays away very quickly. This means that at any given moment, the total amount of Radon present on the entire planet (in the crust and atmosphere combined) is incredibly small, estimated to be only a few tens of kilograms.\n    *   **Other Reservoirs**: While Helium is also produced by radioactive decay in the crust and significant amounts are trapped in natural gas reserves, its total mass on Earth is still vastly greater than the total mass of Radon. The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is estimated to be about 2 trillion kilograms (2 x 10^12 kg). This is immensely larger than the ~20-30 kg of Radon present on the entire planet.\n    *   **The year 2002**: The relative abundances of the stable noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are constant over human timescales. The concentration of Radon is in a steady state (rate of production equals rate of decay), so its average abundance would not have been significantly different in 2002 compared to today. Therefore, the year is not a critical factor in the answer.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nComparing the total estimated mass of each noble gas on Earth, Radon is by far the rarest. Its extreme rarity is a direct consequence of its radioactivity and short half-life, which prevents it from accumulating in any significant quantity.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
