    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific physicist based on a set of clues. Let's break down these clues:\n1.  **A physicist:** The person is a scientist specializing in physics.\n2.  **Better known for work in the microscopy field:** Their primary fame comes from contributions to microscopy.\n3.  **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery:** The discovery is related to the formation of images in optics. A \"real image\" is one formed by the convergence of light rays.\n4.  **After it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker:** The discovery was not planned but was sparked by an accident involving a non-scientist.\n5.  **Cleaning concave mirrors:** This detail specifies the context of the accident. Concave mirrors are curved mirrors that can form real images.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues and Formulate a Search Strategy**\nThe most distinctive clue is the anecdote about the custodial worker. This is a very specific story that is likely associated with only one major discovery. The other clues (microscopy, optical effect, concave mirrors) help to narrow down the field and confirm the identity. We should look for a famous discovery in microscopy that has this particular origin story.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Potential Candidates**\nLet's consider famous figures in the history of microscopy and optics.\n*   **Antonie van Leeuwenhoek & Robert Hooke:** Pioneers of microscopy. However, there are no widely known stories connecting their discoveries to a janitor or concave mirrors. Their work predates many of the more complex optical theories.\n*   **Ernst Abbe:** Famous for his work on the diffraction limit of microscopes. His work was highly theoretical and mathematical. The anecdotal story does not fit his methodical, theory-driven approach.\n*   **Frits Zernike:** A Dutch physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953. His major contribution was the invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**. This perfectly fits the clue of being \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" The phase-contrast method is an \"optical effect\" that makes transparent objects (like living cells) visible by converting phase differences in light into brightness differences in the image.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Anecdote for Frits Zernike**\nNow, let's see if the story about the custodial worker matches Frits Zernike.\n*   The story of Zernike's discovery of phase contrast often includes a key anecdote. While studying diffraction gratings with a telescope (which uses a concave mirror), he was puzzled by faint, ghostly secondary images.\n*   A custodian was tasked with cleaning the laboratory's concave mirrors. In the process, the worker accidentally left a greasy smudge on a mirror.\n*   When Zernike used the smudged mirror in his experiment, he was stunned to see that the previously faint, ghostly images were now sharp and high in contrast.\n*   He realized the smudge, being a thin, semi-transparent film, had acted as a crude **phase plate**. It delayed the light passing through it just enough to make the phase differences visible. This accidental observation provided the crucial insight he needed to intentionally design a proper phase plate, which is the heart of the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nAll the clues in the question point directly to Frits Zernike.\n*   **Physicist:** Yes.\n*   **Microscopy work:** Yes, Nobel Prize for the phase-contrast microscope.\n*   **Optical effect:** Yes, the phase-contrast effect.\n*   **Custodial worker accident:** Yes, the story of the smudged mirror is a key part of his discovery narrative.\n*   **Concave mirrors:** Yes, the experiment where the observation was made involved concave mirrors.\n\nTherefore, the physicist described is Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
