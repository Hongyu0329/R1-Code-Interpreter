    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression to find the Church integer `n` it represents and then calculate `log_2(n)`.\n\n**1. Understand the SKI Combinators and Church Numerals**\n\n*   **S Combinator:** `S f g x = f x (g x)`\n*   **K Combinator:** `K x y = x`\n*   **I Combinator:** `I x = x`\n*   **Church Numeral `c_n`:** A function that takes another function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x` for `n` times. `c_n f x = f^n(x)`.\n    *   `c_0 f x = x`\n    *   `c_1 f x = f(x)`\n    *   `c_2 f x = f(f(x))`\n\n**2. Useful Derived Combinators and Operations**\n\n*   **B (Composition):** `B = S(KS)K`. It composes two functions: `B f g x = f(g(x))`.\n*   **U (Self-application):** `U = S(I)(I)`. It applies an argument to itself: `U x = x x`.\n*   **Multiplication:** `MUL c_m c_n = B c_m c_n`. `(B c_m c_n) f x = c_m(c_n f) x = (f^n)^m(x) = f^{m*n}(x)`.\n*   **Exponentiation:** `POW c_m c_n = c_n c_m`. `(c_n c_m) f x = (c_m^n f) x`. This means applying the function `c_m` to `f`, `n` times. `c_m(c_k f) = c_{m*k} f`. So `c_n c_m = c_{m^n}`.\n\n**3. Deconstruct the Given Expression**\n\nThe expression is: `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break it down into smaller parts. Note that SKI expressions are left-associative, so `A B C` means `((A B) C)`.\n\n*   **Identify `c_2`:**\n    *   First, `S(K(S))(K)` is `S(KS)K`, which is the `B` combinator. The parentheses around `S` are often for clarity.\n    *   The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `S(B)(I)`. Let's evaluate it.\n    *   `S B I f x = B f (I f) x = B f f x = f(f(x)) = c_2 f x`.\n    *   So, `S(S(B))(I) = c_2`.\n\n*   **Identify `Q`:**\n    *   The sub-expression `S(I)(I)` is `U`, the self-application combinator.\n    *   The other major sub-expression is `Q = S(S(B))(U) = S(B)(S(I)(I))`.\n\n*   **Rewrite the Expression:**\n    *   Substituting `c_2` and `Q`, the main expression becomes:\n        `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(c_2)))(Q))`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Expression assuming it's a single, fully-applied combinator**\n\nFor the expression `E` to represent a single value (a Church numeral `n`), it must be a combinator with all its arguments supplied. The top-level combinator is `S`, which takes three arguments. The parsing must be `S(x)(y)(z)`.\n\n*   `x = I`\n*   `y = S(I)`\n*   `z = S(I)(K(c_2))(Q)`\n\nLet's evaluate `z` first.\n*   `z = S I (K c_2) Q` (due to left-associativity)\n*   `z = I Q (K c_2 Q)` (applying `S I k = I k (I k)`) No, `S x y z = x z (y z)`.\n*   `S I (K c_2) Q = I Q (K c_2 Q) = Q (c_2)`.\n*   So, `z = Q c_2`.\n\nNow, let's figure out what `Q c_2` is.\n*   `Q = S B U`.\n*   `Q c_2 = (S B U) c_2`.\n*   Applying `S` to its three arguments (`B`, `U`, `c_2`), we get: `S B U c_2 = B c_2 (U c_2)`.\n*   `U c_2 = c_2 c_2 = c_{2^2} = c_4`.\n*   So, `Q c_2 = B c_2 c_4`.\n*   Applying `B`: `(B c_2 c_4) f x = c_2 (c_4 f) x`.\n*   `c_4 f` is `f^4`. `c_2 (f^4)` applies the function `f^4` twice: `(f^4)^2 = f^8`.\n*   So, `(B c_2 c_4) f x = f^8(x) = c_8 f x`.\n*   Therefore, `z = Q c_2 = c_8`.\n\nNow we can evaluate the full expression `E`.\n*   `E = S I (S I) c_8`\n*   Applying `S` to its arguments (`I`, `S I`, `c_8`): `E = I c_8 ( (S I) c_8 )`.\n*   `E = c_8 ( (S I) c_8 )`.\n*   Let's evaluate the part in the parenthesis: `(S I) c_8 = I c_8 (I c_8) = c_8 c_8`.\n*   Using the exponentiation rule `c_m c_n = c_{n^m}`, we get `c_8 c_8 = c_{8^8}`.\n*   Substitute this back into the expression for `E`: `E = c_8 (c_{8^8})`.\n*   Applying the exponentiation rule again: `c_8 (c_{8^8}) = c_{(8^8)^8}`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nThe expression `E` represents the Church numeral `n` where:\n*   `n = (8^8)^8 = 8^{8 \\times 8} = 8^{64}`\n\nWe need to find `log_2(n)`.\n*   `n = 8^{64} = (2^3)^{64} = 2^{3 \\times 64} = 2^{192}`.\n*   `log_2(n) = log_2(2^{192}) = 192`.\n\nThe final answer is 192.\n\n<<<192>>>"
