    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group: Generalized Quaternion Group of Size 128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$, denoted $Q_{2^n}$, is given by the presentation:\n$Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, x^{2^{n-2}} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor this question, the size of the group is 128. Since $128 = 2^7$, we have $n=7$. The group is $Q_{128}$.\nThe presentation for $Q_{128}$ is:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nKey properties of this group:\n*   The order of the group is $|G| = 128$.\n*   The element $x$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64, which is a maximal subgroup of $G$.\n*   The elements of $G$ can be written in the form $x^i$ or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\n*   The center of the group is $Z(G) = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle = \\{1, x^{32}\\}$, which is the unique subgroup of order 2.\n*   For any element of the form $g = x^i y$, its square is $g^2 = (x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i(yx^i y^{-1})y^2 = x^i(x^{-i})y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$. This means any element not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ has order 4.\n\n**2. Define \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is not universally standard, but its common technical meaning refers to the $k$-th power subgroup of a group $G$, denoted $G^k$. This subgroup is defined as:\n$G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$\nThis is the subgroup generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form for all integers $k$.\n\n**3. Calculate the k-th Power Subgroups, $G^k$**\n\nTo find the subgroup $G^k$, we need to compute the $k$-th power of every element in $G$. We can split the elements of $G$ into two types: those in $\\langle x \\rangle$ and those not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Elements of the form $x^i$**: $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. The set of all such powers generates the subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n*   **Elements of the form $x^i y$**: We need to analyze $(x^i y)^k$. This depends on whether $k$ is even or odd.\n    *   We know $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   **If k is even**, let $k=2m$. Then $(x^i y)^k = ((x^i y)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\n    *   **If k is odd**, let $k=2m+1$. Then $(x^i y)^k = ((x^i y)^2)^m (x^i y) = (x^{32})^m (x^i y) = x^{32m} x^i y$, because $x^{32}$ is in the center of $G$.\n\nNow we can determine the structure of $G^k$ based on the parity of $k$.\n\n**Case A: k is odd**\nLet $k=2m+1$.\n$G^k = \\langle \\{ (x^i)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\} \\cup \\{ (x^j y)^k \\mid 0 \\le j < 64 \\} \\rangle$\n$G^k = \\langle \\{ x^{ik} \\}, \\{ x^{32m} x^j y \\} \\rangle$\n1.  The first set of generators, $\\{x^{ik}\\}$, generates $\\langle x^k \\rangle$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. Thus, $\\langle x^k \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$. So, $G^k$ contains the entire subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  The second set of generators includes the element for $j=0$, which is $x^{32m}y$.\n3.  Since $G^k$ contains $\\langle x \\rangle$, it contains $x$ and all its powers. Therefore, it contains $(x^{32m})^{-1} = x^{-32m}$.\n4.  Since $G^k$ is a group, it must be closed under multiplication. So it contains the element $(x^{-32m})(x^{32m}y) = y$.\n5.  Because $G^k$ contains both $x$ and $y$, it must contain the entire group they generate, which is $G = Q_{128}$.\nSo, for any odd integer $k$, $G^k = G$. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n\n**Case B: k is even**\nLet $k=2m$.\n$G^k = \\langle \\{ (x^i)^k \\}, \\{ (x^j y)^k \\} \\rangle$\n$G^k = \\langle \\{ x^{ik} \\}, \\{ x^{32m} \\} \\rangle$\n1.  The first set of generators $\\{x^{ik}\\}$ generates the subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n2.  The second set of generators consists of just one element, $x^{32m}$. Let's relate this to $k$. Since $k=2m$, we have $32m = 16(2m) = 16k$. So the element is $x^{16k}$.\n3.  Thus, $G^k = \\langle x^k, x^{16k} \\rangle$.\n4.  Since $x^{16k} = (x^k)^{16}$, the element $x^{16k}$ is already in the cyclic subgroup generated by $x^k$.\n5.  Therefore, for any even integer $k$, $G^k = \\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n\nNow we need to count how many distinct subgroups of the form $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ exist for even $k$.\nThe subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64 are of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of 64. Two subgroups $\\langle x^a \\rangle$ and $\\langle x^b \\rangle$ are identical if and only if $\\gcd(a, 64) = \\gcd(b, 64)$.\nSo we need to find the number of possible values for $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ where $k$ is an even number.\nSince $k$ is even, $k=2m$ for some integer $m$. Then $d = \\gcd(2m, 64)$. This implies that $d$ must be an even divisor of 64.\nThe divisors of $64 = 2^6$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\nThe even divisors of 64 are: $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\nEach of these even divisors gives a distinct subgroup:\n*   $d=2$: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n*   $d=4$: $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n*   $d=8$: $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n*   $d=16$: $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n*   $d=32$: $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n*   $d=64$: $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nThese are **6** distinct subgroups.\n\n**4. Final Count**\n\nWe combine the results from the two cases:\n*   From odd values of $k$, we get 1 subgroup: $Q_{128}$.\n*   From even values of $k$, we get 6 distinct subgroups: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the numbers from both cases.\nTotal number = 1 + 6 = 7.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Definition of the Group:** It's essential to use the correct presentation and properties of $Q_{128}$.\n*   **Definition of Power Subgroup:** The most crucial point is correctly interpreting \"power subgroup\" as $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$. Other interpretations like \"cyclic subgroup\" would lead to a different answer (39 in this case).\n*   **Parity of k:** The structure of $g^k$ for $g \\notin \\langle x \\rangle$ is fundamentally different for even and odd $k$, which dictates the structure of $G^k$.\n*   **Cyclic Subgroup Properties:** Counting the distinct subgroups $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ relies on the property that subgroups of a cyclic group are determined by the divisors of its order, and specifically for $\\langle x^k \\rangle \\le \\langle x \\rangle$, its structure depends on $\\gcd(k, 64)$.\n*   **Completeness:** We have considered all integers $k$ by splitting them into odd and even cases, ensuring no possibilities are missed.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n1.  Identify the group as $G = Q_{128}$.\n2.  Define power subgroups as $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n3.  For any odd $k$, we showed $G^k = G$. This accounts for one subgroup.\n4.  For any even $k$, we showed $G^k = \\langle x^k \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n5.  Since $k$ is even, $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ must be an even divisor of 64.\n6.  The even divisors of 64 are $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n7.  These 6 distinct divisors give 6 distinct subgroups: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\langle x^{64} \\rangle=\\{1\\}$.\n8.  The total number of power subgroups is the single subgroup from the odd case plus the six subgroups from the even case.\n9.  Total = $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\n<<<7>>>"
