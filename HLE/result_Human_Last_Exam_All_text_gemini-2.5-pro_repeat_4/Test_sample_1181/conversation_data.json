    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The character is defined by a particular feeling: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This detail is very specific and points to a particular line of dialogue or a moment of character reflection in the film.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and Their Motivations**\nLet's consider each character from the answer choices in the context of the film's plot and themes.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist, a psychologist sent from Earth to the Solaris station. The film opens with him on Earth, surrounded by nature, including the sounds of water and foliage. Since he has just left Earth, the memory of these sounds would be very fresh for him. While he experiences profound psychological turmoil, it's related to his past guilt concerning his wife, Hari, not shame over forgetting Earthly sounds.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is not a human but a \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created by the sentient ocean of Solaris from Kris's memories. She has no authentic experience or memory of Earth. Her journey is about discovering her own nature and consciousness, not about nostalgia for a planet she has never known. Therefore, she could not miss or be ashamed of missing something she never had.\n\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** Snaut is one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He has been in space for a long time and has become cynical, weary, and philosophical about humanity's purpose in the cosmos. He often serves as a mouthpiece for the film's existential themes, reflecting on their isolation and detachment from Earth. A character who has been away for a long time and feels his humanity slipping away is a prime candidate for expressing this kind of sentiment.\n\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** Sartorius is the other surviving scientist. He is portrayed as cold, detached, and rigorously scientific. He views the \"visitors\" as a mere phenomenon to be studied and eliminated. He actively rejects emotional responses and would likely see nostalgia for Earth as a contemptible weakness, not something to be ashamed of missing.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Gibarian is the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. He only appears in a pre-recorded video message and as a \"visitor\" to Kris. In his video, he is terrified and desperate, warning Kris about the station. His focus is on the immediate, frightening reality of Solaris, not on nostalgic shame.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThere is a key conversation in the film between Kris and Snaut in the station's library. During this philosophical discussion about their purpose and isolation, Snaut reflects on how long he has been away from Earth. He says the following line (or a close translation): \"I'm ashamed to say I've forgotten so much. Do you remember the sound of rustling leaves?\" This dialogue directly matches the question. Snaut is the one who explicitly expresses shame over his memory of Earth fading.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Evidence**\nThe direct evidence from the film's dialogue confirms that Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to miss (or more accurately, to have almost forgotten) the sound of rustling leaves. This aligns perfectly with his character's role as the long-serving, weary philosopher of the station who mourns their collective loss of connection to their home world.\n\n<<<C>>>"
