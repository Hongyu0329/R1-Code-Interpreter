    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the phonological development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti` into its descendant forms in several Germanic languages.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **PIE Root and Laryngeals:** The form `*seh₂gieti` contains the laryngeal `*h₂`. The cognates Latin `sāgīre` and Hittite `sākizzi` confirm that the sequence `*eh₂` before a consonant results in a long vowel `*ā`. Therefore, the effective PIE root form is `*sāg-`.\n2.  **PIE Verbal Formation:** The suffix `*-ie/o-` (in its zero-grade form `*-ye-` before the thematic vowel) marks this as a present tense verb that will become a Class I weak verb in Germanic languages. The ending `*-ti` is the 3rd person singular active present indicative.\n3.  **Grimm's Law:** This is the first major sound shift that defines the Germanic family. It affects the PIE stop consonants.\n4.  **Verner's Law:** This law is a supplement to Grimm's Law, voicing fricatives when the original PIE accent did not fall on the immediately preceding syllable. In this case, the accent in `*-ye/o-` presents was on the root, so Verner's Law does not apply to the consonants in the ending.\n5.  **Germanic Vowel Shifts:** PIE vowels underwent systematic changes in Proto-Germanic. Notably, PIE `*ā` becomes PGmc `*ō`.\n6.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The high front vowel `i` or semivowel `j` in the suffixes of Class I weak verbs causes the back vowel of the root (`*ō` in this case) to shift to a front vowel. This process and its results differ slightly in each daughter language.\n7.  **High German Consonant Shift:** This second major sound shift differentiates Old High German from the other West Germanic languages (like Old English) and North Germanic (Old Norse).\n8.  **Language-Specific Developments:** Each language has its own unique changes regarding the treatment of suffixes, endings, and unstressed vowels.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** `*sāg-ye-ti` (simplified from `*seh₂gieti`)\n*   **Apply Grimm's Law:**\n    *   `s` remains `s`.\n    *   Voiced stop `*g` becomes voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   Voiceless stop `*t` becomes voiceless fricative `*þ` (written as þ).\n*   **Apply Vowel Shifts:**\n    *   Long `*ā` becomes long `*ō`.\n*   **Reconstruct the Verb Form:**\n    *   This is a Class I weak verb. The PIE suffix `*-yeti` becomes PGmc `*-ijiþ` in the 3rd person singular.\n    *   Combining the changes: `*sāg-ye-ti` → **`*sōkijiþ`**.\n    *   The infinitive would be `*sōkijaną`, which means 'to seek, to look for', a semantic shift from 'to give a sign'.\n\n**2. From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **PGmc Form:** `*sōkijiþ`\n*   **Apply I-Umlaut:** The `i/j` in the suffix fronts the root vowel `*ō` to a long front rounded vowel `*œ̄` (often written as `æ` in normalized Old Norse). So, `sōk-` → `sœk-` (`sæk-`).\n*   **Apply Phonological Simplifications:**\n    *   The `*-j-` is lost after a long root syllable (`sōk-` is long).\n    *   The medial vowel of the ending (`-i-`) is lost.\n    *   The 3rd person singular ending `*-þ` becomes `-r` in Old Norse. The full ending `*-iþ` develops into `-ir`.\n*   **Combine the changes:** `*sōkijiþ` → `*sœ̄kiþ` → **`sækir`**.\n\n**3. From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **PGmc Form:** `*sōkijiþ`\n*   **Apply Palatalization:** In the pre-Old English period, the velar `*k` was palatalized to `*ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/) when it came before the front semivowel `*j`.\n*   **Apply I-Umlaut:** The `i/j` fronts and unrounds the root vowel `*ō`. The process is `*ō` → `*œ̄` → `*ē`. So, `sōk-` → `sēċ-`.\n*   **Apply Changes to Endings:** The PGmc 3rd person singular ending `*-iþ` becomes `-eþ` or is syncopated to `-þ` in Old English.\n*   **Combine the changes:** `*sōkijiþ` → `*sœ̄ċiþ` → `*sēċiþ` → **`sēceþ`** (or the syncopated form `sēcþ`). The verb is attested as `sēcan`.\n\n**4. From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **PGmc Form:** `*sōkijiþ`\n*   **Apply the High German Consonant Shift:**\n    *   `*k` after a vowel becomes the voiceless fricative `*hh` (written `hh` or `ch`).\n    *   `*þ` at the end of the word becomes the voiced stop `*d`.\n*   **Apply OHG Vowel Shift:** The PGmc long `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German. So, `sōk-` → `suohh-`.\n*   **Apply Changes to Endings:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-it` in OHG (from pre-OHG `*-id`).\n*   **Apply I-Umlaut:** The `i` in the ending `-it` would cause umlaut of `uo` to `üe`. However, this change occurred late in the OHG period and was often not reflected in the spelling. The non-umlauted form is standard for Old High German texts.\n*   **Combine the changes:** `*sōkijiþ` → `*suohhid` → **`suohhit`**. The verb is attested as `suohhen`.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijiþ`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sækir`\n*   **Old English:** `sēceþ` (or `sēcþ`)\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhit`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijiþ; Old Norse: sækir; Old English: sēceþ; Old High German: suohhit>>>"
