    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question concerns the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*, a member of the Spinosauridae family. The specific anatomical feature is the \"lacrimal recess.\" The lacrimal is a bone in the skull that typically sits in front of the eye socket (orbit). A recess is a depression or fossa on a bone's surface. The question asks how many smaller depressions are *contained within* this main lacrimal recess.\n\n2.  **Consult Primary Scientific Literature:** To answer a specific anatomical question like this, it is essential to refer to the primary scientific papers that describe the fossil. The holotype (the original specimen upon which the species is based) of *Irritator challengeri* is designated SMNS 58022. The most comprehensive description of this skull is in the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In their paper, Sues et al. (2002) provide a detailed description of the skull bones. When describing the lacrimal, they note the presence of a large, deep fossa on its lateral (outer) surface. This is the lacrimal recess (also referred to as part of the antorbital fossa).\n\n4.  **Examine the Contents of the Lacrimal Recess:** The crucial part of the description for answering the question is what lies *inside* this recess. The paper states: \"The lacrimal recess houses **two** large, subcircular fenestrae, one located dorsal to the other.\"\n\n5.  **Interpret the Terminology:**\n    *   **Recess/Fossa:** A depression or hollow area on a bone.\n    *   **Fenestra:** A \"window\" or opening through a bone.\n    *   In this context, the two fenestrae are large openings situated within the broader depression of the lacrimal recess. These openings are the most significant features contained within the recess and are themselves surrounded by bony depressions. Therefore, they are the \"depressions\" that the lacrimal recess contains.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the definitive description of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull, the large lacrimal recess contains two distinct, smaller features, which are described as large fenestrae (openings).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Source Authority:** The answer relies entirely on the accuracy and detail of the primary scientific description. The Sues et al. (2002) paper is the authoritative source for the anatomy of the *Irritator* holotype.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** It's important to understand that a \"fenestra\" (opening) is located within a \"fossa\" or \"recess\" (depression). The question asks what the recess *contains*, and the answer is the two fenestrae.\n*   **Specificity:** The question is very specific to *Irritator challengeri*. While other spinosaurids have a similar skull structure, the exact number and arrangement of features can vary between species. The answer must be based on descriptions of *Irritator* itself.\n\nBy following these steps and consulting the primary scientific literature, we can confidently determine the number.\n\n<<<2>>>"
