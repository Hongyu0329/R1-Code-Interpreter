    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the system and its equilibrium points.**\n    The system of differential equations is given by:\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (5u^2(t) - 3u(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$\n    $u'(t) = u^2(t)(u(t) - 1)$\n    We are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n    Equilibrium points are found by setting $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n    From $u' = 0$, we have $u^2(u - 1) = 0$, which gives $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: u = 0**\n        Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n        $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n        So, one equilibrium point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n    *   **Case 2: u = 1**\n        Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n        $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1 - 1) = 0$\n        $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d + 1) = 0 \\implies d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n        So, two other equilibrium points are $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$.\n\n    The equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points using linearization.**\n    The Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n    $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   **At (1, 0):**\n        $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10 - 3)(0) - 3 + 4 & 4(0) + 5 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node.\n\n    *   **At (1, -1):**\n        $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10 - 3)(-1) - 3 + 4 & 4(-1) + 5 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7 - 3 + 4 & -4 + 5 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n    *   **At (0, 0):**\n        $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a degenerate case, and linearization is inconclusive.\n\n3.  **Identify the separatrices.**\n    A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of the phase space with different qualitative behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are always separatrices.\n    Our system has a saddle point at $(1, -1)$. We need to find its stable and unstable manifolds.\n\n4.  **Find the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1).**\n    We can find the trajectories by solving the differential equation for the phase portrait:\n    $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)}$\n    This is a Riccati equation for $d$ as a function of $u$. These are generally difficult to solve. However, we can test for a simple solution, such as a polynomial in $u$. Let's try to find an invariant curve of the form $d = f(u)$.\n    Let's test the specific functional form $d = -u^2$. If this is an invariant curve, its derivative with respect to time, $d'$, must be consistent with the system's equations.\n    If $d = -u^2$, then using the chain rule, $d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot u'(t)$.\n    Substitute $u'(t) = u^2(t)(u(t)-1)$:\n    $d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot [u^2(t)(u(t)-1)] = -2u^3(u-1) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\n    Now, let's substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original expression for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1 - u)$\n    $d' = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n    $d' = (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3$\n    $d' = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\n    Both expressions for $d'$ are identical. This confirms that the curve defined by the equation **$d = -u^2$** is an exact solution trajectory (an invariant curve) of the system.\n\n5.  **Verify that this curve is a separatrix.**\n    Let's check if this curve passes through any of the equilibrium points.\n    *   For $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. The curve passes through the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n    *   For $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n    A trajectory that connects to a saddle point is part of that saddle's stable or unstable manifold, and is therefore a separatrix.\n\n    Let's check the direction of flow on this curve. For $u \\in (0, 1)$, $u' = u^2(u-1) < 0$. This means that as time increases, $u$ decreases from 1 towards 0. Therefore, the trajectory on the curve $d = -u^2$ flows from the saddle point $(1, -1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$. This means that the curve segment for $u \\in [0, 1]$ is one of the two branches of the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n\n    Thus, the curve $d = -u^2$ is a separatrix of the system."
