    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total welfare.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Market Equilibrium:** The point where the supply and demand curves intersect. At this point, the quantity supplied ($Q_S$) equals the quantity demanded ($Q_D$), and the price is the same for both. Let's denote the equilibrium quantity as $Q_E$ and the equilibrium price as $P_E$.\n*   **Total Welfare (TW):** Also known as total surplus, it is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS).\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** The benefit consumers receive, calculated as the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price line, from $Q=0$ to $Q=Q_E$. The formula is:\n        $CS = \\int_0^{Q_E} P_D(Q) \\,dQ - P_E \\cdot Q_E$\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS):** The benefit producers receive, calculated as the area below the equilibrium price line and above the supply curve, from the minimum quantity produced to $Q=Q_E$. The formula is:\n        $PS = P_E \\cdot Q_E - \\int_{Q_{min}}^{Q_E} P_S(Q) \\,dQ$\n*   **Total Welfare Formula:** By adding CS and PS, the term $P_E \\cdot Q_E$ cancels out, giving a direct formula for Total Welfare:\n    $TW = CS + PS = \\int_0^{Q_E} P_D(Q) \\,dQ - \\int_{Q_{min}}^{Q_E} P_S(Q) \\,dQ$\n\n**2. Find the Domain of the Supply Function**\n\n*   The supply function is $P_S = \\ln(Q_S^3 - 2)$.\n*   **Careful Point:** The natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is only defined for $x > 0$. Therefore, we must have $Q_S^3 - 2 > 0$, which implies $Q_S^3 > 2$, or $Q_S > \\sqrt[3]{2}$.\n*   This means the supply curve starts at $Q_{min} = \\sqrt[3]{2} \\approx 1.2599$. This will be the lower limit for the producer surplus integral.\n\n**3. Find the Market Equilibrium ($Q_E, P_E$)**\n\n*   At equilibrium, $P_S = P_D$.\n    $\\ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$\n*   **Careful Point:** This equation is a transcendental equation, which means it cannot be solved algebraically for $Q$. We need to find the solution numerically.\n*   By testing values, we can narrow down the solution:\n    *   If $Q = 4$, $P_S = \\ln(4^3 - 2) = \\ln(62) \\approx 4.127$. $P_D = 18e^{-\\arctan(4)} \\approx 4.781$. Here, $P_D > P_S$.\n    *   If $Q = 5$, $P_S = \\ln(5^3 - 2) = \\ln(123) \\approx 4.812$. $P_D = 18e^{-\\arctan(5)} \\approx 4.558$. Here, $P_S > P_D$.\n*   This confirms the equilibrium quantity $Q_E$ lies between 4 and 5. Using a numerical solver (like the Newton-Raphson method or a computational tool), we find a more precise value:\n    $Q_E \\approx 4.69466$\n*   Now we find the equilibrium price $P_E$ by substituting $Q_E$ into either function:\n    *   $P_E = \\ln((4.69466)^3 - 2) \\approx \\ln(101.461) \\approx 4.620$\n    *   $P_E = 18e^{-\\arctan(4.69466)} \\approx 18e^{-1.35976} \\approx 4.621$\n*   The results are consistent. We'll use $Q_E \\approx 4.69466$ and $P_E \\approx 4.62$.\n\n**4. Set up the Integrals for Total Welfare**\n\n*   Using the formula $TW = \\int_0^{Q_E} P_D(Q) \\,dQ - \\int_{Q_{min}}^{Q_E} P_S(Q) \\,dQ$ with our values:\n    $TW = \\int_0^{4.69466} 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} \\,dQ - \\int_{\\sqrt[3]{2}}^{4.69466} \\ln(Q^3 - 2) \\,dQ$\n*   **Careful Point:** The antiderivatives of $e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$ and $\\ln(Q^3 - 2)$ are not elementary functions. Therefore, these definite integrals must also be calculated using numerical methods.\n\n**5. Calculate the Value of the Integrals**\n\n*   **Integral 1 (from Demand):**\n    $I_D = \\int_0^{4.69466} 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} \\,dQ$\n    Numerical evaluation gives: $I_D \\approx 28.515$\n*   **Integral 2 (from Supply):**\n    $I_S = \\int_{1.25992}^{4.69466} \\ln(Q^3 - 2) \\,dQ$\n    Numerical evaluation gives: $I_S \\approx 10.145$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Total Welfare**\n\n*   Total Welfare is the difference between the two integrals:\n    $TW = I_D - I_S \\approx 28.515 - 10.145 = 18.37$\n\nThe total welfare at the market equilibrium is approximately 18.37.\n\n<<<18.37>>>"
