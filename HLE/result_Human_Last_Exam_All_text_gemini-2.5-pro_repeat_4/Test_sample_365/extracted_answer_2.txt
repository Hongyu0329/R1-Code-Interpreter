The product is a bicyclic ketone containing a nine-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring (a bicyclo[7.3.0]dodecane derivative). The ketone group is located at the C2 position of the original norbornene framework, and a new double bond is formed between the original C1 and C6 positions. The 7,7-dimethoxy ketal and the 4'-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy) groups remain intact. The transformation occurs via a stereospecific anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement.
