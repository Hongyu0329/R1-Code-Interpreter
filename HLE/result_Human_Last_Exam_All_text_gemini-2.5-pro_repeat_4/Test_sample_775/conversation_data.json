    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Statement\nWe are given the following conditions:\n1.  $S = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$ is the unit square in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n2.  $A$ and $B$ are two subsets of the plane.\n3.  $A$ and $B$ are **closed** (in the topology of $\\mathbb{R}^2$).\n4.  $A$ and $B$ are **connected**.\n5.  Their union is the unit square: $A \\cup B = S$.\nThe question is to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection, $A \\cap B$.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Analysis and Simple Cases\nFirst, let's establish that $A$ and $B$ must be subsets of the square $S$. If a point $p$ is in $A$, then $p$ is in $A \\cup B$. Since $A \\cup B = S$, $p$ must be in $S$. Thus, $A \\subseteq S$ and similarly $B \\subseteq S$.\n\nLet's explore some simple configurations:\n*   **Case 1: One component.** Let $A = [0, 1/2] \\times [0,1]$ (the left half of the square) and $B = [1/2, 1] \\times [0,1]$ (the right half).\n    *   $A$ and $B$ are closed and connected.\n    *   $A \\cup B = S$.\n    *   $A \\cap B = \\{1/2\\} \\times [0,1]$. This is a line segment, which is connected. So, the number of components is 1.\n\n*   **Case 2: Attempting two components.** Let's try to make the intersection two disjoint line segments, for example, $L_1 = \\{1/3\\} \\times [0,1]$ and $L_2 = \\{2/3\\} \\times [0,1]$.\n    *   Let's try to define $A$ and $B$ such that their intersection is $L_1 \\cup L_2$.\n    *   A possible choice for $A$ would be the outer strips: $A = ([0, 1/3] \\times [0,1]) \\cup ([2/3, 1] \\times [0,1])$. This set is closed, but it is **not connected**.\n    *   To make $A$ connected, we must add a \"bridge\" between its two parts. For instance, we could add the bottom edge: $A' = A \\cup ([0,1] \\times \\{0\\})$. Now $A'$ is connected.\n    *   Let's define $B$ to be the middle strip: $B = [1/3, 2/3] \\times [0,1]$. This is closed and connected.\n    *   The union $A' \\cup B$ is the entire square $S$.\n    *   The intersection is $A' \\cap B = (\\{1/3\\} \\times [0,1]) \\cup (\\{2/3\\} \\times [0,1]) \\cup ([1/3, 2/3] \\times \\{0\\})$.\n    *   This intersection is connected because the two vertical lines are connected by the horizontal segment at the bottom. We are back to 1 component.\n\n### Step 3: The Apparent Contradiction with Topological Theorems\nThe simple examples suggest the answer might be 1. This is supported by a powerful theorem in topology:\n\n**Theorem (Sierpinski/Kuratowski on Unicoherence):** If a unicoherent continuum $X$ is the union of two closed, connected sets $A$ and $B$, then their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also connected.\n\nLet's check if the conditions of the theorem apply:\n*   **Continuum:** The unit square $S$ is compact and connected, so it is a continuum.\n*   **Unicoherent:** A space is unicoherent if it is connected and cannot be separated by any closed connected subset. A key property is that simply connected (or more generally, having a trivial first homology/cohomology group) Peano continua are unicoherent. The square is contractible, so it is a Peano continuum and it is unicoherent.\n*   **Sets A and B:** They are given as closed and connected.\n\nBased on this theorem, the intersection $A \\cap B$ must be connected, which would imply the maximum number of components is 1.\n\nThis leads to a paradox, as this is a well-known problem whose answer is not 1. This implies there must be a subtle flaw in the application of the theorem.\n\n### Step 4: Resolving the Contradiction - The Role of Local Connectedness\nThe flaw lies in a hidden assumption in the most common proofs of the unicoherence theorem. While the theorem is often stated as above, its standard proofs (e.g., using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence in singular homology) implicitly require stronger conditions on the sets $A$ and $B$ than just being closed and connected. Specifically, they might need to be \"tame\" in some way (e.g., being neighborhood deformation retracts).\n\nThe theorem holds if the sets $A$ and $B$ are also **locally connected**. However, the problem only states they are connected. A set can be connected without being locally connected. The classic example is the **Topologist's Sine Curve**: the graph of $y = \\sin(1/x)$ for $x \\in (0, 1]$, together with the segment $\\{0\\} \\times [-1, 1]$. This set is connected but is not locally connected at any point on the y-axis segment.\n\nBy using such \"pathological\" sets that are not locally connected, one can construct examples that bypass the theorem and result in a disconnected intersection.\n\n### Step 5: Construction for an Arbitrary Number of Components\nIt is possible to construct sets $A$ and $B$ that satisfy all the conditions of the problem, yet their intersection has any desired finite number of components, $N$.\n\nThe construction is technical, but the main idea is to create \"walls\" between regions using interlocking sets resembling the topologist's sine curve.\n\n**Sketch of construction for N components:**\n1.  Choose $N$ disjoint vertical line segments in the upper half of the square. Let these be the desired components of the intersection, e.g., $I_k = \\{x_k\\} \\times [1/2, 1]$ for $k=1, \\dots, N$.\n2.  Define $A$ and $B$ using graphs of functions that oscillate infinitely as they approach certain lines, creating connected but not locally connected sets.\n3.  For example, one can define a set $A$ that contains the left side of the square and is \"wired\" to be connected to regions to the left of each oscillating graph. Similarly, $B$ contains the right side of the square and is connected to regions to the right of the graphs.\n4.  The sets $A$ and $B$ can be made closed and connected. Their union can be made to be the entire square $S$.\n5.  Their intersection will be precisely the $N$ chosen line segments $I_k$, plus some other points where the closures meet. With careful construction, the intersection can be made to be exactly the union of the $N$ segments, which has $N$ components.\n\nSince we can construct an example for any finite integer $N$, there is no largest finite number of components. The number of components can be arbitrarily large. Therefore, the \"largest number\" must be understood as the supremum of all possible numbers of components.\n\nThe constructions can even be extended to produce a countably infinite number of components.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of connected components of the intersection can be any positive integer. There is no finite upper bound. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is infinity.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
