    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Book:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Action:** The main character gets married.\n*   **Information required:** The name of the character the main character marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist and main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a 21st-century man who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the relationships of the main character.**\nThroughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski is guided and protected by a powerful, post-human entity. His relationship with this entity is central to the plot. This being helps him navigate the complex and overwhelming reality of the far future.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate the concept of \"marriage\" within the novel's context.**\nThe world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a post-human one, where concepts like relationships and unions have evolved far beyond 21st-century norms. A \"marriage\" in this context is not a traditional ceremony but a much deeper, more complex form of bonding or merging. Adam Zamoyski, a \"stahs\" (Standard Human), forms such a union with his post-human guardian.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the name of the character with whom this union is formed.**\nThe post-human being who becomes Adam Zamoyski's guide, protector, and partner in this profound union is named Angelina. Their bond is the closest equivalent to marriage in the story, representing a complete partnership and merging of their fates.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The term \"marriage\" must be interpreted within the science-fiction context of the book. It is not a conventional marriage but a form of post-human union.\n*   The main character's name is Adam Zamoyski.\n*   The character he unites with is Angelina, a vastly superior post-human being. Their relationship is a core theme, exploring the connection between a baseline human and a god-like entity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the plot of the novel, the main character, Adam Zamoyski, enters into a deep, life-altering union, the equivalent of marriage, with the character Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
