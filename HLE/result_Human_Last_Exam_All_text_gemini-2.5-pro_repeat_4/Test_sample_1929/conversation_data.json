    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene), with the structure CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, with the structure CCl₂=CF₂. This is a substituted alkene.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and an alkene (known as a dienophile) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition, where the \"4\" refers to the four pi electrons of the diene and the \"2\" refers to the two pi electrons of the dienophile.\n\n2.  **Understand the Diels-Alder Mechanism:**\n    *   This is a concerted, pericyclic reaction, meaning all bond formation and bond breaking occurs in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n    *   The reaction forms a new six-membered ring.\n    *   Three pi bonds (two from the diene, one from the dienophile) are consumed.\n    *   Two new carbon-carbon single (sigma) bonds and one new carbon-carbon double (pi) bond are formed within the new ring.\n\n3.  **Construct the Product Structure:**\n    *   The four carbon atoms from butadiene and the two carbon atoms from 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene will form the six-membered ring.\n    *   The new double bond in the product will be between the central carbons (C2 and C3) of the original butadiene.\n    *   The terminal carbons of butadiene (C1 and C4) will form new single bonds with the two carbons of the dienophile.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexene derivative.\n    *   The substituents on the dienophile (two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms) will be attached to adjacent carbons in the newly formed cyclohexene ring. One carbon atom will have two chlorine atoms (a CCl₂ group), and the adjacent carbon will have two fluorine atoms (a CF₂ group).\n\n4.  **Consider Regiochemistry:**\n    *   The diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical.\n    *   The dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is unsymmetrical.\n    *   Because the diene is symmetrical, there is only one possible product. It does not matter which end of the diene attacks which end of the dienophile; both pathways lead to the exact same molecule.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product Name (IUPAC):**\n    *   The parent structure is a cyclohexene.\n    *   We number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers, C1 and C2.\n    *   Next, we number the remaining atoms in the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. Numbering in either direction from the double bond results in substituents at positions 4 and 5. The full locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n    *   Since the locant set is identical in both directions, we use alphabetical order of the substituents to decide the numbering. \"Dichloro\" comes before \"difluoro\".\n    *   Therefore, the CCl₂ group is assigned to position 4, and the CF₂ group is assigned to position 5.\n    *   The name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Reaction Identification:** Correctly identifying the reaction as a Diels-Alder is the most crucial step.\n*   **Diene Conformation:** The Diels-Alder reaction requires the diene to be in the *s-cis* conformation (where both double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond). Butadiene can easily adopt this conformation.\n*   **Symmetry:** Recognizing the symmetry of butadiene is key to determining that only one product is formed, simplifying the analysis.\n*   **Bond Changes:** Be clear about which bonds are broken (3 pi bonds) and which are formed (2 sigma bonds, 1 pi bond).\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature:** Following the systematic rules for naming the product confirms its unique structure and avoids ambiguity.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,3-butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. This forms a six-membered ring. The resulting product is a cyclohexene ring where the two sp³-hybridized carbons (that came from the dienophile) are adjacent. One of these carbons is bonded to two chlorine atoms, and the other is bonded to two fluorine atoms. Due to the symmetry of butadiene, only one product is possible. Following IUPAC rules, this product is named 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
