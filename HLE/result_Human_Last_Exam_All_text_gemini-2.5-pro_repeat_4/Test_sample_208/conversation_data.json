    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radius of the circle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nThe question asks for the radius of a large circle that can \"tightly pack\" fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius of one. This is a classic mathematical problem known as the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. \"Tightly packed\" means we are looking for the smallest possible large circle, which corresponds to the most efficient, space-saving arrangement of the fourteen smaller circles.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Optimal Arrangement**\nThe arrangement of the smaller circles determines the size of the larger container circle. For a given number of circles (N), there is one specific arrangement (or sometimes multiple arrangements with the same efficiency) that is the most compact. These optimal packings are often non-intuitive.\n\nFor N=14, the optimal packing has been mathematically proven and is well-documented. It does not consist of a simple symmetric pattern. The confirmed optimal arrangement for fourteen circles is:\n*   One circle at the center.\n*   A ring of five circles surrounding the central one.\n*   An outer ring of eight circles filling the gaps around the inner ring of five.\n\nThis structure can be denoted as a (1, 5, 8) arrangement.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** It's crucial not to assume a simple, visually pleasing arrangement. For instance, putting two circles in the middle and arranging twelve around them is *less* efficient than the (1, 5, 8) configuration. The optimal solution is the one that minimizes the radius of the container circle, which is the (1, 5, 8) layout.\n\n**Step 3: The Geometry of the Solution**\nThe radius of the large container circle (R) is determined by the small circle whose outmost point is farthest from the center of the container. For the (1, 5, 8) arrangement, this requires a complex geometric calculation.\n\n*   Let the radius of the small circles be `r = 1`.\n*   Let the radius of the large container circle be `R`.\n*   The center of the large circle is designated as the origin (0,0).\n*   The calculation would involve placing the centers of the 14 small circles on a coordinate plane, expressing their distances from each other (they must be at least `2r` apart) and from the container circle, and then minimizing the container's radius `R`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The geometry is not straightforward. The rings of 5 and 8 circles are not perfectly regular. The circles in the 5-ring, for example, are not spaced at equal 72° angles because they are pushed and pulled by both the central circle and the outer 8-ring to achieve the tightest fit. Performing this calculation from first principles is highly complex and beyond the scope of a standard problem.\n\n**Step 4: Using Established Mathematical Results**\nFor circle packing problems, mathematicians have computed and tabulated the ratio of the large circle's radius (R) to the small circle's radius (r) for various numbers of circles (N). We can rely on these established results.\n\nFor N=14, the accepted value for the radius ratio `R/r` is approximately:\n`R / r ≈ 3.484399...`\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Final Answer**\nWe are given that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`. We can now calculate the radius `R` of the large circle.\n\n*   `R = (R / r) * r`\n*   `R ≈ 3.484399... * 1`\n*   `R ≈ 3.484399...`\n\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\n\n*   The number is `3.484399...`\n*   The first four significant digits are `3`, `4`, `8`, and `4`.\n*   The fifth significant digit is `3`, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we don't change the fourth digit).\n\nTherefore, the radius of the large circle up to 4 significant digits is 3.484.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Pay close attention to the rounding instructions. \"4 significant digits\" means we count from the first non-zero digit. In `3.484399`, the significant digits are 3, 4, 8, 4, 3, 9, 9. The first four are 3, 4, 8, 4.\n\n<<<3.484>>>"
