    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Terms**\n\nTo answer the question \"How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\", we must first understand each term:\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The definition includes \"non-empty\". A single point is non-empty, compact, and connected, so it qualifies as a \"degenerate continuum\". The question does not specify \"non-degenerate\".\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means there is a homeomorphism from the space to a subset of $R^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if, for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism f from X to itself (an automorphism) such that f(x) = y. In simple terms, the space looks the same from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are not counting the spaces themselves, but the number of distinct \"shapes\" they can have. Two spaces are in the same class if they are homeomorphic (topologically equivalent).\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct topological types of objects that satisfy all three properties: being a continuum, being planar, and being homogeneous.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Potential Candidates**\n\nLet's examine potential candidates and see if they fit the criteria.\n\n1.  **The Point:**\n    *   **Continuum?** Yes. A single point is non-empty, compact, and connected. It is a degenerate continuum.\n    *   **Planar?** Yes. It's a point in the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous?** Yes, trivially. There's only one point, so the condition holds.\n    *   This gives us our **first homeomorphism class**.\n\n2.  **The Simple Closed Curve (e.g., the Circle, SÂ¹):**\n    *   **Continuum?** Yes. It is a non-empty, compact, and connected subset of the plane.\n    *   **Planar?** Yes, by definition.\n    *   **Homogeneous?** Yes. For any two points on a circle, a simple rotation of the circle (which is a homeomorphism) can map one point to the other.\n    *   *Careful Point:* Any space homeomorphic to a circle is a \"simple closed curve\". By the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem, these are precisely the curves that separate the plane into two connected components. Homogeneity is a topological property, so all simple closed curves are homogeneous.\n    *   This gives us our **second homeomorphism class**. It is distinct from the point because it is non-degenerate.\n\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:**\n    *   The pseudo-arc is a famous example in continuum theory. It is a snake-like, indecomposable continuum.\n    *   **Continuum?** Yes, by definition.\n    *   **Planar?** Yes, it can be embedded in the plane. A key property is that it does not separate the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous?** Yes. This is a deep theorem first proved by R. H. Bing.\n    *   *Careful Point:* Is it a new class? Yes. The pseudo-arc is not homeomorphic to the circle because the circle is locally connected everywhere, while the pseudo-arc is not locally connected at any point.\n    *   This gives us our **third homeomorphism class**.\n\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    *   This is another, more complex continuum constructed by \"replacing\" each point of a circle with a pseudo-arc in a continuous way.\n    *   **Continuum?** Yes.\n    *   **Planar?** Yes, it can be embedded in the plane. Unlike the pseudo-arc, it separates the plane into two components.\n    *   **Homogeneous?** Yes, this is another known result.\n    *   *Careful Point:* Is this a new class?\n        *   It is not homeomorphic to the point (it's non-degenerate).\n        *   It is not homeomorphic to the circle because it is not locally connected.\n        *   It is not homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc because the circle of pseudo-arcs separates the plane, while the pseudo-arc does not. Separation of the plane is a topological invariant for planar embeddings.\n    *   This gives us our **fourth homeomorphism class**.\n\n### **Step 3: The Classification Theorem**\n\nWe have found four distinct classes. Is the list complete? This question was a major research topic in topology. The work of several topologists, most notably R. H. Bing and J. T. Rogers, Jr., led to a complete classification.\n\nThe **Classification Theorem for Homogeneous Planar Continua** states that any homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of the four examples listed above.\n\nOther famous homogeneous continua are ruled out:\n*   **Solenoids:** These are homogeneous but are known to be non-planar.\n*   **The Menger Sponge/Curve:** This is homogeneous but is also non-planar.\n*   **The Pseudo-circle:** This is planar but was proven by J. T. Rogers, Jr. to be non-homogeneous.\n\nTherefore, the search is exhaustive, and no other possibilities exist.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\nBased on the analysis and the definitive classification theorem, there are exactly four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. They are:\n\n1.  The Point (degenerate)\n2.  The Simple Closed Curve (non-degenerate, locally connected)\n3.  The Pseudo-arc (non-degenerate, not locally connected, non-separating)\n4.  The Circle of Pseudo-arcs (non-degenerate, not locally connected, separating)\n\nThe total number of classes is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
