    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\n*   **Graph:** We are considering a single, simple, undirected graph `G`.\n*   **Vertices:** The graph `G` has exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. The \"size\" of a clique is the number of vertices in it.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** A clique of size `k` induces a complete subgraph `K_k`. The question asks for the number of different `k` for which a `K_k` exists as an induced subgraph. This is equivalent to asking for the number of different clique sizes present in the graph `G`.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist in any single graph `G` on 128 vertices.\n\n**2. Core Insight: The Structure of Clique Sizes**\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between different clique sizes within a single graph `G`.\n\n*   Let `ω(G)` denote the **clique number** of `G`, which is the size of the largest possible clique in `G`.\n*   By definition, `G` contains a clique of size `ω(G)`. Let's call this clique `C_max`.\n*   Now, consider any integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ ω(G)`. We can select any subset of `k` vertices from the largest clique `C_max`.\n*   Since every vertex in `C_max` is connected to every other vertex in `C_max`, any subset of its vertices will also have this property.\n*   Therefore, any subset of `k` vertices from `C_max` forms a clique of size `k`.\n*   This leads to a crucial conclusion: **If a graph `G` contains a clique of size `ω(G)`, it must also contain cliques of all integer sizes from 1 to `ω(G)`.**\n\n**3. Characterizing the Set of Clique Sizes**\n\n*   Based on the insight from Step 2, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G`, let's call it `S(G)`, must contain the set `{1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`.\n*   By the definition of `ω(G)` as the size of the *largest* clique, no clique of size greater than `ω(G)` can exist in `G`.\n*   Therefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in `G` is precisely `S(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\n**4. Rephrasing the Problem**\n\n*   The number of different clique sizes in `G` is the cardinality of the set `S(G)`, which is `|S(G)| = ω(G)`.\n*   The original question, \"determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes,\" is now simplified. It is equivalent to asking: **\"What is the maximum possible clique number `ω(G)` for a graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices?\"**\n\n**5. Solving the Simplified Problem**\n\n*   **Upper Bound:** The clique number `ω(G)` of a graph `G` on `n` vertices can never be greater than `n`. This is because a clique is a subset of the graph's vertices, and a subset cannot be larger than the set itself. For our case, `n = 128`, so `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n*   **Achievability:** We need to show that this upper bound can be reached. Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n*   In `K_{128}`, the entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique. Therefore, the clique number of this graph is `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The number of different clique sizes in any graph `G` on 128 vertices is equal to its clique number, `ω(G)`.\n*   The maximum possible value for `ω(G)` is 128.\n*   This maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`.\n*   For `G = K_{128}`, the set of clique sizes is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`, and the number of different sizes is 128.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Induced Subgraph vs. Clique:** The wording \"induced subgraphs\" is formal but does not change the essence of the problem. A set of `k` vertices forms a clique if and only if the subgraph they induce is a complete graph `K_k`.\n*   **\"Simultaneously Appear\":** This simply means all the clique sizes must be found within the same single graph, which is the foundation of our analysis.\n*   **Trivial vs. Non-Trivial Cliques:** The analysis includes cliques of size 1 (a single vertex) and size 2 (a single edge), which are valid. The consecutive nature of clique sizes `{1, 2, ..., k}` is the key, and this holds regardless of how small `k` is.\n\nThe problem, while sounding complex, simplifies to finding the maximum clique number on a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n<<<128>>>"
