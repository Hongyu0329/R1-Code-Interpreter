    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the \"true profession\" of a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault, which he concealed from British counterintelligence during WWII, leading them to suspect him of being a German spy.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Person:** Andre Vernault\n    *   **Nationality:** Belgian\n    *   **Status:** Refugee in the UK\n    *   **Time Period:** World War II\n    *   **Accusation:** Suspected German spy\n    *   **Reason for Suspicion:** He hid his real profession from interrogators.\n    *   **Goal:** Find out his real profession.\n\n3.  **Research and Information Gathering:** A search for \"Andre Vernault WWII spy\" or similar terms leads to historical accounts, notably in Ben Macintyre's well-researched book \"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies,\" which is based on declassified MI5 files.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Case of Andre Vernault:**\n    *   Vernault arrived in the UK in 1941 and was interrogated by MI5, the UK's domestic counterintelligence service.\n    *   Interrogators, like the officer Thomas \"Tin Eye\" Stephens, found Vernault's story inconsistent and evasive. He claimed to be a commercial artist.\n    *   In the high-stakes environment of WWII, any inconsistency or concealment was a major red flag for espionage. The British were on high alert for German *Abwehr* agents trying to infiltrate the country.\n    *   Vernault's evasiveness was not due to espionage training, but due to personal embarrassment. He believed his true profession was undignified and would not be taken seriously.\n\n5.  **Identify the True Profession:** According to the historical records, Andre Vernault's actual profession, which he was trying to hide, was that of a **lion tamer**. He had worked in a circus before the war. He felt this profession was ridiculous and would make him look foolish, so he invented a more respectable-sounding career as a commercial artist.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The irony of the situation is that Vernault's attempt to avoid embarrassment by lying about his job directly led British counterintelligence to believe he was a trained spy using a cover story. This resulted in his imprisonment as a suspected enemy agent. His true profession was lion tamer.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Context is key:** The paranoia and heightened security of wartime Britain are essential to understanding why a simple lie could lead to such serious consequences.\n*   **Human element:** The story highlights a very human motivation (embarrassment) being misinterpreted in a clinical, high-stakes intelligence environment.\n*   **Source reliability:** The information is confirmed in reputable historical works based on official, declassified government documents, making it a factual account.\n\nHis true profession was a lion tamer.\n\n<<<Lion tamer>>>"
