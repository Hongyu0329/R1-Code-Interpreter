    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Query**\nThe question asks for a specific Hollywood feature film with four distinct and mandatory elements:\n1.  **Production:** Produced by a major Hollywood film studio.\n2.  **Character:** The character involved is a teenager.\n3.  **Object:** The teenager is riding a pink bicycle.\n4.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination**\nLet's consider famous movies featuring teenagers and bikes.\n*   **E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982):** Features teenagers on bikes, but the bikes are not pink, and the iconic scene involves flying *over* government vehicles, not riding toward them.\n*   **Pretty in Pink (1986):** The title is promising, but the protagonist, a teenager, drives a pinkish car (a Karmann Ghia), not a pink bike.\n*   **It (2017):** Features a group of teens/pre-teens (the Losers' Club) who frequently use their bikes. They are pursued by a car driven by the bully Henry Bowers, but none of the bikes are pink, and they are generally fleeing from the car, not deliberately pedaling toward it in a confrontational manner.\n*   **Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985):** Features an iconic bicycle, but the bike is red, and the character Pee-wee Herman is an adult man-child, not a teenager.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Specific Action**\nThe action of pedaling *toward* an oncoming car suggests a scene of defiance, a game of \"chicken,\" or a display of newfound fearlessness or power. This points toward genres like drama, thriller, or horror.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Correct Film**\nConsidering all the specific elements together—a teenager, a distinctively pink bike, and a confrontation with a car—leads to a memorable scene in the 2011 horror-comedy remake **Fright Night**.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the Film Against All Criteria**\nLet's check if *Fright Night* (2011) meets all the conditions:\n1.  **Major Film Studio:** Yes. The film was produced by DreamWorks Pictures and distributed by Touchstone Pictures (a part of The Walt Disney Studios). These are major players in Hollywood.\n2.  **Teenager Character:** Yes. The scene involves the character \"Evil\" Ed Lee (played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who is a high school teenager.\n3.  **Pink Bike:** Yes. In the scene, after being turned into a vampire, Ed is shown riding a small, bright pink girl's bicycle, complete with handlebar streamers. The choice of bike is intentionally absurd and menacing.\n4.  **Pedals Toward Oncoming Car:** Yes. Ed is in the middle of a street at night on the pink bike. An oncoming car approaches and honks at him. Instead of moving, Ed stares down the driver and begins to pedal slowly and deliberately *toward* the car. The terrified driver is forced to swerve violently to avoid him, crashing the car off the side of the road. This scene perfectly matches the description.\n\nConclusion: The film that contains all the specified elements is the 2011 remake of *Fright Night*.\n\n<<<Fright Night (2011)>>>"
