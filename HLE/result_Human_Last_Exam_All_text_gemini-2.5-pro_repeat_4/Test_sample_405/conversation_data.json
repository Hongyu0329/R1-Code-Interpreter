    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to determine the number of different colors that can be observed in the pure allotropes of the element phosphorus.\n\n2.  **List the Major Allotropes of Phosphorus:** Phosphorus exists in several different structural forms called allotropes. The most well-known and distinct allotropes are:\n    *   White Phosphorus\n    *   Red Phosphorus\n    *   Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus)\n    *   Black Phosphorus\n\n3.  **Determine the Color of Each Allotrope:**\n    *   **White Phosphorus ($P_4$):** When absolutely pure, this allotrope is a colorless or white, waxy solid. However, it is highly reactive and, upon exposure to light, it slowly converts to the more stable red phosphorus. This transformation gives its surface a distinct **yellow** color. Therefore, it is commonly observed as yellowish-white. We can consider \"white/yellow\" as one color category for this allotrope.\n    *   **Red Phosphorus:** This is a polymeric form of phosphorus. As its name implies, its color is **red**. The exact shade can vary from orange to dark, purplish-red depending on factors like particle size and method of preparation, but the fundamental color is red.\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):** This is a crystalline, polymeric form that is more stable than white phosphorus but less stable than black phosphorus. It has a distinct **violet** or deep purple color.\n    *   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus under standard conditions. It has a layered, crystalline structure similar to graphite. It is **black** and flaky with a metallic luster.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Colors:** Based on the analysis of the four main allotropes, we can list the following distinct colors:\n    1.  White / Yellow\n    2.  Red\n    3.  Violet\n    4.  Black\n\n    Counting these distinct color categories gives a total of four.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Purity and Observation:** The question asks for colors that \"can be observed\" in \"pure\" allotropes. For white phosphorus, while the pure form is white/colorless, the observed color is almost always yellow due to rapid degradation. Thus, \"yellow\" is a valid observed color for this pure allotrope.\n*   **Exclusion of Other Forms:**\n    *   **Brown Phosphorus:** This is generally considered an impure form, a mixture of red and black phosphorus, not a pure allotrope.\n    *   **Scarlet Phosphorus:** This is typically considered a finer, more reactive form of red phosphorus, not a fundamentally different allotrope. Its color is a shade of red.\n    *   **Diphosphorus ($P_2$):** This is a gaseous form stable only at very high temperatures and is not a solid with an observable color under normal conditions.\n    *   **2D Allotropes (e.g., Blue Phosphorus):** In modern materials science, 2D allotropes like \"blue phosphorus\" have been synthesized. However, questions in general chemistry typically refer to the classical, stable, bulk allotropes. Including these newer, specialized forms would change the answer, but the standard and most accepted answer is based on the four classical forms.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the four primary, well-established, and macroscopically observable allotropes of phosphorus, we identify four distinct colors.\n\n1.  **White/Yellow** (from White Phosphorus)\n2.  **Red** (from Red Phosphorus)\n3.  **Violet** (from Violet Phosphorus)\n4.  **Black** (from Black Phosphorus)\n\nTherefore, there are 4 observable colors in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n<<<4>>>"
