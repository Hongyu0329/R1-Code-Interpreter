    "Answering this question requires a systematic enumeration of all possible valid boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols that evaluate to true. The available symbols are {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\nThe standard operator precedence is `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest).\n\nWe can categorize the expressions into two main groups: those without parentheses and those with parentheses.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Expressions Without Parentheses\n\nWe identify all possible valid syntactic structures of length 5 that do not use `(` or `)`. Let `O` represent an operand (T or F), `B` a binary operator (& or |), and `U` the unary operator (!).\n\n1.  **Structure: `O B O B O`**\n    *   This has 3 operands and 2 binary operators.\n    *   Number of operand combinations: 2³ = 8.\n    *   Number of operator combinations: 2² = 4 (`&&`, `&|`, `|&`, `||`).\n    *   We count how many of the 32 total expressions are true:\n        *   `O & O & O`: True only for `T&T&T`. (1 case)\n        *   `(O & O) | O`: True if the third operand is T (4 cases), or if the first two are T and the third is F (1 case). Total: 5 cases.\n        *   `O | (O & O)`: True if the first operand is T (4 cases), or if the last two are T and the first is F (1 case). Total: 5 cases.\n        *   `O | O | O`: True unless all operands are F. 8 - 1 = 7 cases.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = **18**\n\n2.  **Structure: `!!O B O`**\n    *   Equivalent to `O B O`. There are 2 operands and 1 binary operator.\n    *   `O & O`: True only for `T&T`. (1 case: `!!T&T`)\n    *   `O | O`: True for `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. (3 cases: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`)\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n3.  **Structure: `O B !!O`**\n    *   Equivalent to `O B O`. Same logic as the previous case.\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n4.  **Structure: `!O B !O`**\n    *   `!O & !O`: True only if both `!O` are true, meaning both `O` are F (`!F&!F`). (1 case)\n    *   `!O | !O`: True unless both `!O` are false, meaning both `O` are T. True for 3 of 4 operand pairs. (3 cases)\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n5.  **Structure: `!!!!O`**\n    *   `!!!!` is a double negation of a double negation, so `!!!!O` is equivalent to `O`.\n    *   True only if `O` is T (`!!!!T`). (1 case)\n    *   Total for this structure: **1**\n\n**Total for expressions without parentheses:** 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = **31**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Expressions With Parentheses\n\nThese expressions must contain one pair of `(` and `)`. We classify them by their overall structure.\n\n1.  **Structure: `( E )` where `E` has length 3.**\n    *   `E = OBO`: The inner expression `OBO` must be true.\n        *   `O&O` is true for `T&T` (1 case) -> `(T&T)`\n        *   `O|O` is true for `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T` (3 cases) -> `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`\n        *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n    *   `E = !!O`: The inner `!!O` is true if `O` is T. (1 case: `(!!T)`)\n    *   `E = (O)`: The inner `(O)` is true if `O` is T. (1 case: `((T))`)\n\n2.  **Structure: Unary operator applied to a parenthesized expression.**\n    *   `!(E)`: `(E)` must have length 4, which is not possible as it requires `E` to have length 2. Wait, the total length is 5, so `1 + len((E)) = 5`, so `len((E)) = 4`. This implies `E` has length 2. Valid length-2 expressions are `!O`.\n        *   Structure `!(!O)`: True if `!O` is F, which means `O` is T (`!(!T)`). (1 case)\n    *   `!!(E)`: `(E)` must have length 3, so `E` has length 1.\n        *   Structure `!!(O)`: True if `O` is T (`!!(T)`). (1 case)\n\n3.  **Structure: Binary operator connects a parenthesized and a non-parenthesized part.**\n    The structure is `E1 B E2`, where one part has parentheses. Total length is 5.\n    *   `O B (E)` where `(E)` has length 3. So `E` has length 1.\n        *   `E=O`: `O B (O)`. Equivalent to `O B O`. (4 true cases)\n        *   `E=!O` is not possible, as `(!O)` has length 3, so `E` has length 1.\n    *   Let's be more precise with symbols. `O B (E)` is `O B (X)`. `X` is `O` or `!O`? No, `E` must be a valid expression of length 1, so `E` is `O`.\n    *   Structure `O B (!O)`: `O B (!O)` is a valid structure of length 5.\n        * `O & (!O)`: True if `O=T` and `!O=T`. `T&(!F)` is T. (1 case)\n        * `O | (!O)`: True unless `O=F` and `!O=F`. True for `T|(!T)`, `T|(!F)`, `F|(!F)`. (3 cases)\n        * Total: **4**\n    *   Structure `(O) B O`: Equivalent to `O B O`. (4 true cases)\n    *   Structure `(!O) B O`: Symmetric to `O B (!O)`. (4 true cases)\n\nLet's re-tally the parenthesized expressions to avoid confusion and double-counting.\n*   `(OBO)`: **4**\n*   `(!!O)`: **1**\n*   `((O))`: **1**\n*   `!(!O)`: **1**\n*   `!!(O)`: **1**\n*   `(O)BO`: **4** (e.g., `(T)&T`)\n*   `OB(O)`: **4** (e.g., `T&(T)`)\n*   `(!O)BO`: **4** (e.g., `(!F)&T`)\n*   `OB(!O)`: **4** (e.g., `T&(!F)`)\n\n**Total for expressions with parentheses:** 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **24**\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation\n\nTotal True Expressions = (Without Parentheses) + (With Parentheses)\nTotal = 31 + 24 = 55\n\n<<<55>>>"
