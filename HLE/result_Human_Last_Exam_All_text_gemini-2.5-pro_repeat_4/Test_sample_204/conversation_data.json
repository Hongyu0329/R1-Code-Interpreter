    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)`\n\nThe vector field `n` is defined in 3D space `(x, y, z)`. Let's break down its components.\nFirst, we use cylindrical coordinates `(rho, f, z)` where `rho = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and `f = atan2(y, x)`.\n\n1.  **`f = atan2(y, x)`**: This is the standard azimuthal angle `phi` in cylindrical or spherical coordinates.\n2.  **`r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z*z)`**: In cylindrical coordinates, this is `r2 = sqrt((rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2)`. This term represents a distance. Specifically, `r2` is zero when `z=0` and `rho^2 = 0.5`. This defines a circle in the xy-plane with radius `rho = 1/sqrt(2)`. `r2` is a measure of distance from any point `(x,y,z)` to this circle.\n3.  **`G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`**: This is a scalar function `G(x,y,z)`. Let's analyze its range:\n    *   When a point is on the circle (`r2 = 0`), `G = PI * exp(0) = PI`.\n    *   When a point is infinitely far from the circle (`r2 -> infinity`), `G = PI * exp(-inf) = 0`.\n    *   So, the function `G` maps `R^3` to the range `(0, PI]`.\n4.  **`nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`, `ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`, `nz = cos(G)`**: This is the standard spherical representation of a unit vector `n`. The angle `G` acts as the polar (colatitudinal) angle `theta`, and `f` is the azimuthal angle `phi`. Thus, `n` is a map from the space `R^3` to the surface of a unit sphere `S^2`.\n\nThe problem asks for the Hopf charge of this map `n: R^3 -> S^2`. Topologically, we can compactify `R^3` to `S^3` by adding a point at infinity. The map becomes `n: S^3 -> S^2`. The Hopf charge is an integer that classifies such maps, representing the element of the homotopy group `pi_3(S^2) = Z`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Hopf Charge using the Linking Number Definition\n\nThe Hopf charge `Q_H` is defined as the linking number of the preimages of two regular values (points) on the target sphere `S^2`.\n\n1.  **Choose two points on S^2**: Let's choose the North Pole `P_N = (0, 0, 1)` and the South Pole `P_S = (0, 0, -1)`.\n\n2.  **Find the preimage of the South Pole (`P_S`)**:\n    The South Pole corresponds to `nz = -1`.\n    `cos(G) = -1`. Since `G` is in `(0, PI]`, this implies `G = PI`.\n    From the definition of `G`, `PI = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, which gives `exp(-10 * r2) = 1`.\n    This means `r2 = 0`.\n    From the definition of `r2`, `(rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = 0`.\n    This holds if and only if `z = 0` and `rho^2 - 0.5 = 0`.\n    So, the preimage of the South Pole is the circle `C_S` defined by `x^2 + y^2 = 0.5` and `z = 0`.\n\n3.  **Find the preimage of the North Pole (`P_N`)**:\n    The North Pole corresponds to `nz = 1`.\n    `cos(G) = 1`. Since `G` is in `(0, PI]`, this is only possible if `G` approaches `0`.\n    `G -> 0` implies `exp(-10 * r2) -> 0`, which means `r2 -> infinity`.\n    The preimage of the North Pole is the set of points at infinity in `R^3`. In the compactified `S^3` space, this is a single point.\n\n4.  **Calculate the linking number**: To find the Hopf charge, we can find the linking number of the preimage of the South Pole (`C_S`) and the preimage of any other point, for example, a point on the equator of `S^2`.\n    Let's find the preimage of an equatorial point `P_E = (cos(f_0), sin(f_0), 0)`.\n    This requires `nz = cos(G) = 0`, which means `G = PI/2`.\n    It also requires `f = f_0`.\n    The condition `G = PI/2` implies `PI/2 = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, so `exp(-10 * r2) = 1/2`.\n    Taking the natural log, `-10 * r2 = -ln(2)`, so `r2 = ln(2) / 10`.\n    The preimage `C_E` is the curve defined by `f = f_0` and `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    The condition on `r2` is `(rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`.\n    This curve `C_E` is a closed loop in the half-plane defined by `f=f_0`.\n\n5.  **Determine the linking number `Lk(C_E, C_S)`**: We can calculate this by counting how many times the curve `C_E` passes through the disk `D_S` bounded by the circle `C_S`.\n    *   The disk `D_S` is `x^2 + y^2 <= 0.5, z = 0`. Let's give `C_S` the standard counter-clockwise (CCW) orientation, so the normal vector to `D_S` is `n = (0, 0, 1)`.\n    *   The curve `C_E` intersects the `z=0` plane when `(rho^2 - 0.5)^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`, which means `rho^2 - 0.5 = +/- ln(2)/10`.\n        *   `rho^2 = 0.5 + ln(2)/10`. This point is outside the disk `D_S`.\n        *   `rho^2 = 0.5 - ln(2)/10`. This point is inside the disk `D_S`.\n    *   So, the loop `C_E` passes through the disk `D_S` exactly once.\n    *   To find the sign of the linking, we check the direction of passage. Let's parameterize `C_E` with a parameter `t`: `rho^2 - 0.5 = (ln(2)/10)cos(t)` and `z = (ln(2)/10)sin(t)`. The intersection with the disk `D_S` occurs when `rho^2 < 0.5`, which means `cos(t)` must be negative. The intersection with the `z=0` plane is at `t=PI`.\n    *   The velocity component in the z-direction is `v_z = dz/dt = (ln(2)/10)cos(t)`.\n    *   At the intersection point `t=PI`, `v_z = (ln(2)/10)cos(PI) = -ln(2)/10 < 0`.\n    *   The curve is passing through the disk in the negative z-direction. The normal to the disk is in the positive z-direction. Since the velocity vector and the normal vector are in opposite directions, the sign of the intersection is `-1`.\n    *   Therefore, the linking number is `Lk(C_E, C_S) = -1`.\n\n### Step 3: Alternative Analysis via Map Decomposition\n\nThe Hopf charge of a map `n: S^3 -> S^2` can be understood by decomposing `n` into a standard map and a map on `S^2`. Let `h: S^3 -> S^2` be the canonical Hopf map, which has `Q_H(h) = 1`. Any other map `n` can be written as `n = g . h`, where `g: S^2 -> S^2`. The Hopf charge of `n` is then `Q_H(n) = deg(g) * Q_H(h) = deg(g)`.\n\n1.  **Analyze the map `g`**: The map `n` is given in spherical coordinates `(G, f)`. Let the standard coordinates on `S^2` be `(theta, phi)`. The canonical Hopf map `h` would map `R^3` to `S^2` such that the polar angle `theta` increases from `0` to `PI` as we move radially outwards from the core circle.\n2.  **Our map `n`**: The polar angle is `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`. As `r2` goes from `0` to `infinity`, `G` goes from `PI` down to `0`. This means the polar angle is traversed in the reverse direction compared to the standard convention.\n3.  **The map `g`**: The induced map on the sphere is `g(theta, phi) = (PI - theta, phi)`. In Cartesian coordinates `(nx, ny, nz)`, this corresponds to `nx' = sin(PI-theta)cos(phi) = sin(theta)cos(phi)`, `ny' = sin(PI-theta)sin(phi) = sin(theta)sin(phi)`, and `nz' = cos(PI-theta) = -cos(theta)`. So, `g(nx,ny,nz) = (nx,ny,-nz)`. This is a reflection across the equatorial plane of `S^2`.\n4.  **Degree of `g`**: A reflection is an orientation-reversing map. Its degree is `deg(g) = -1`.\n5.  **Hopf charge of `n`**: `Q_H(n) = deg(g) * Q_H(h) = (-1) * 1 = -1`.\n\nBoth methods of analysis consistently yield a Hopf charge of -1. The specific form of the Whitehead formula involves integrals of differential forms that are subtle to compute due to singularities (\"Dirac strings\"), but the result of the integration must match the topological linking number. The linking number is unambiguously -1. While some physics literature might adopt a convention where this configuration is assigned a charge of +1, a direct calculation based on the standard definitions of linking number and map degree gives -1.\n\nFinal Answer should be the result of the analysis.\n\n<<< -1 >>>"
