    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Compound and Synthesis Method:** The question asks about the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$). The most common, direct, and efficient method for producing $XeF_4$ is the reaction of elemental Xenon (Xe) gas with elemental Fluorine ($F_2$) gas.\n\n2.  **Write the Chemical Equation:** The balanced chemical reaction for the formation of Xenon tetrafluoride is:\n    $Xe(g) + 2F_2(g) \\rightarrow XeF_4(s)$\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** Xenon is a noble gas, which means it is chemically very inert and unreactive. For it to form chemical bonds, a significant amount of energy, known as activation energy, must be supplied.\n    *   **Fluorine ($F_2$):** Fluorine is the most electronegative and reactive element, but the reaction with inert Xenon still requires specific conditions.\n    *   **The reaction is exothermic**, meaning it releases heat once it starts, but it requires a high initial temperature to overcome the activation energy barrier.\n\n4.  **Consider the Role of Temperature in Synthesis:**\n    *   **Low Temperatures (e.g., 78 °C, 0 °C, -78 °C):** At these temperatures, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules is insufficient to overcome the activation energy. The collision frequency and energy are too low for a reaction to occur at any practical or \"efficient\" rate. Therefore, options D, E, and F are not viable for this thermal synthesis method.\n    *   **Moderate to High Temperatures:** Heat is used to provide the necessary activation energy. The specific temperature is crucial because it influences which xenon fluoride product is formed.\n        *   **Synthesis of $XeF_2$:** Typically occurs with an excess of Xenon at around 400 °C.\n        *   **Synthesis of $XeF_4$:** Requires a specific molar ratio of reactants (typically 1 part Xe to 5 parts $F_2$ to ensure there is enough fluorine but not a huge excess). The established and optimal temperature for this synthesis is **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a good rate to be considered efficient.\n        *   **Synthesis of $XeF_6$:** Requires a large excess of fluorine (e.g., 1 part Xe to 20 parts $F_2$) and higher temperatures (around 500-600 °C) and pressures.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on Efficiency:**\n    *   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is too high for the efficient production of $XeF_4$. It would favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride ($XeF_6$), especially if the fluorine concentration is not perfectly controlled.\n    *   **B. 400 C:** This is the textbook, standard temperature for the efficient laboratory and industrial synthesis of pure $XeF_4$. It provides sufficient activation energy for the reaction to proceed efficiently without promoting the formation of $XeF_6$.\n    *   **C. 200 C:** While some reaction might occur, the rate would be significantly slower than at 400 °C, making the process far less efficient and impractical for producing significant quantities.\n    *   **D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C:** These temperatures are far too low for the thermal reaction to be initiated.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The term **\"efficiently\"** is key. It implies a method that produces a good yield in a reasonable amount of time. This points directly to the established, standard synthesis conditions.\n*   The question asks for the **\"coldest temperature\"** at which this efficient production can occur. This means we are looking for the lower boundary of the optimal temperature range.\n*   Different xenon fluorides ($XeF_2$, $XeF_4$, $XeF_6$) have different optimal synthesis conditions (reactant ratios, temperature, pressure). 400 °C is specifically associated with the efficient production of $XeF_4$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the established chemical principles for the synthesis of noble gas compounds, 400 °C is the standard and efficient temperature required to produce Xenon tetrafluoride. Lower temperatures are not efficient, and higher temperatures favor other products. Therefore, 400 °C is the coldest temperature among the choices at which $XeF_4$ can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
