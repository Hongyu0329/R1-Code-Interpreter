    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific character from a specific episode of a web cartoon.\n    *   **Web Cartoon:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n    *   **Sub-series:** \"Teen Girl Squad\"\n    *   **Episode:** #15\n    *   **Event:** Junior prom\n    *   **Performer:** A cardboard cutout\n    *   **Identity:** A fictional singer\n\n2.  **Locate the Episode Content:** The episode in question is \"Teen Girl Squad Issue 15\". This episode's plot revolves around the four main girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) getting ready for and attending their Junior Prom.\n\n3.  **Identify the Performer Scene:** A key part of the prom is the musical entertainment. The episode addresses who is performing at the event.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Dialogue:** In the episode, the character Cheerleader excitedly announces the musical guest. Her line of dialogue is: \"I can't believe we got Cardboard Marzipan to play at our prom!\"\n\n5.  **Identify the Character:**\n    *   The dialogue explicitly names the performer as \"Cardboard Marzipan\".\n    *   Marzipan is a well-established main character in the greater \"Homestar Runner\" universe.\n    *   She fits the description of a \"fictional singer\" as she is often depicted as a musician, singer, and songwriter (for example, in the band Cool Tapes).\n\n6.  **Confirm the Details:** The scene then cuts to the prom's stage, where a literal cardboard cutout of the character Marzipan is standing next to a microphone. This confirms all the details of the question: a cardboard cutout of a fictional singer named Marzipan is the performer.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Name:** While the singer is Marzipan, the episode specifically refers to the performer as \"Cardboard Marzipan,\" which is the most precise answer based on the direct dialogue.\n*   **Fictional within Fictional:** The question asks for a *fictional singer*. Marzipan is a fictional character within the fictional universe of Homestar Runner, so this condition is met.\n*   **Source Verification:** The information comes directly from the visual and audio content of the specified episode, \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Marzipan>>>"
