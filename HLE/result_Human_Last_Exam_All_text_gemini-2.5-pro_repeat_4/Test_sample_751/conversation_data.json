    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe are given a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by the state-space equations:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nWe need to find a similarity transformation z = T*x that transforms the system into observer canonical form (A_o, C_o), where A_o = T*A*T⁻¹ and C_o = C*T⁻¹. The main goal is to determine the new output matrix, C_o.\n\n**Step 2: Check Observability and Determine Observability Indices**\nThe structure of the observer canonical form depends on the observability indices of the system (A, C). First, we must check if the system is observable. The observability matrix is given by O = [Cᵀ; (CA)ᵀ; (CA²)ᵀ]ᵀ.\n\nLet's denote the rows of C as c₁ᵀ and c₂ᵀ:\nc₁ᵀ = [0, 1, 0]\nc₂ᵀ = [1, 1, 0]\n\nWe compute the necessary matrix products:\nA = [[1, 1, 0],\n     [2, 1, 1],\n     [0, 2, 0]]\n\nc₁ᵀA = [0, 1, 0] * A = [2, 1, 1]\nc₂ᵀA = [1, 1, 0] * A = [3, 2, 1]\n\nNow, we form the full observability matrix O by stacking these rows and check its rank.\nO = [c₁ᵀ; c₂ᵀ; c₁ᵀA; c₂ᵀA; ...]\nTo check for observability, we only need to find n=3 linearly independent rows from this sequence. Let's select rows in the order c₁ᵀ, c₂ᵀ, c₁ᵀA, c₂ᵀA, ... and check for linear independence at each step.\n\n1.  c₁ᵀ = [0, 1, 0]\n2.  c₂ᵀ = [1, 1, 0]. This is linearly independent of c₁ᵀ.\n3.  c₁ᵀA = [2, 1, 1]. Let's check if {c₁ᵀ, c₂ᵀ, c₁ᵀA} are linearly independent.\n    We form a matrix with these rows and find its determinant:\n    det([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]) = 0*(1-0) - 1*(1-0) + 0 = -1.\n    Since the determinant is non-zero, these three vectors are linearly independent and form a basis for ℝ³.\n\nThe system is observable, and its rank is 3. The observability indices (ν₁, ν₂) are determined by how many rows associated with each output (c₁ and c₂) were needed.\n- We used c₁ᵀ and c₁ᵀA (2 rows) from the first output. So, ν₁ = 2.\n- We used c₂ᵀ (1 row) from the second output. So, ν₂ = 1.\nThe observability indices are {2, 1}. The sum is 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the system order.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Transformation Matrix T**\nThe transformation matrix T that converts the system to observer canonical form is constructed from the linearly independent rows we just identified. The rows must be ordered according to the observability indices.\nT = Q = [c₁ᵀ; c₁ᵀA^(ν₁-1); c₂ᵀ; ...]\nFor our indices {2, 1}, the matrix T is:\nT = [c₁ᵀ; c₁ᵀA; c₂ᵀ]\nT = [[0, 1, 0],\n     [2, 1, 1],\n     [1, 1, 0]]\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Inverse of the Transformation Matrix, T⁻¹**\nTo find the new matrices A_o and C_o, we need T⁻¹.\nFirst, find the determinant of T:\ndet(T) = 0*(1*0 - 1*1) - 1*(2*0 - 1*1) + 0*(...) = 1.\nNext, find the adjugate of T:\nadj(T) = [[-1, 0, 1],\n          [ 1, 0, 0],\n          [ 1, 1, -2]]\nSince det(T) = 1, T⁻¹ is equal to the adjugate matrix:\nT⁻¹ = [[-1, 0, 1],\n       [ 1, 0, 0],\n       [ 1, 1, -2]]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the New Output Matrix C_o**\nThe new output matrix in observer canonical form is given by C_o = C*T⁻¹.\nC = [[0, 1, 0],\n     [1, 1, 0]]\nT⁻¹ = [[-1, 0, 1],\n       [ 1, 0, 0],\n       [ 1, 1, -2]]\n\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]\nC_o = [[(0)(-1)+(1)(1)+(0)(1), (0)(0)+(1)(0)+(0)(1), (0)(1)+(1)(0)+(0)(-2)],\n       [(1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(0)(1), (1)(0)+(1)(0)+(0)(1), (1)(1)+(1)(0)+(0)(-2)]]\nC_o = [[1, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 1]]\n\nThis resulting matrix C_o has the standard structure for an observer canonical form with observability indices {2, 1}, where the rows are unit vectors e₁ᵀ and e₃ᵀ (since ν₁=2, the second block starts at index ν₁+1=3).\n\n**Step 6: (Optional) Verify the new state matrix A_o**\nWe can also compute A_o = T*A*T⁻¹ and verify that it has the correct canonical structure and that its characteristic polynomial matches that of A.\nThe characteristic polynomial of A is det(sI - A) = s³ - 2s² - 3s + 2.\nA_o = T * A * T⁻¹ = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] * [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]\nA_o = [[2, 1, 1], [4, 5, 1], [3, 2, 1]] * [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]\nA_o = [[0, 1, 0],\n       [2, 1, 2],\n       [0, 1, 1]]\nThe characteristic polynomial of A_o is det(sI - A_o) = s³ - 2s² - 3s + 2, which matches the original. The structure is also a valid observer canonical form for indices {2, 1}.\n\nThe value of the new matrix C is C_o.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
