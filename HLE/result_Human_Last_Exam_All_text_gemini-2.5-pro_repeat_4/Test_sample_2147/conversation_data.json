    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian (1859-1943).\n*   **Action:** He \"frequently accused\" and \"denounced\" something.\n*   **Object of Accusation:** \"the Western culture of his time\".\n*   **Specific Phrase:** He called \"X-Ys\" a \"stagnant swamp\".\n*   **Clue:** The format \"X-Y\" suggests a two-word term, possibly hyphenated.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Pavel Milyukov's background and views.**\n*   Milyukov was a leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in Russia. While he admired Western political institutions (like constitutionalism and parliamentarianism), he was known to be culturally conservative.\n*   He held traditional, 19th-century academic tastes in art and culture. He was a vocal critic of modernism and the avant-garde movements that were emerging in the early 20th century.\n*   This creates a key distinction: he was politically progressive (for his time in Russia) but culturally conservative. His criticism was aimed at the *cultural* developments in the West, not its political structures.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the historical context of \"Western culture\" in the early 20th century.**\n*   The period from roughly 1890 to 1914 saw a radical break from traditional forms in the arts. In painting, this was the era of Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and the beginnings of Cubism.\n*   These new movements were highly controversial. They were often met with ridicule and hostility from the general public and established cultural critics who were accustomed to Realism and Impressionism.\n*   The term \"stagnant swamp\" is a powerful metaphor suggesting decay, corruption, and a lack of healthy, forward-flowing development. A cultural conservative like Milyukov would have seen these new art forms not as progress, but as a degenerate dead end.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the clues to identify \"X-Y\".**\n*   We are looking for a two-word term (\"X-Y\") representing a prominent Western cultural movement of the time that Milyukov would have detested.\n*   The most significant and controversial art movement that fits this description is **Post-Impressionism**. The term \"Post-Impressionists\" was coined by the British critic Roger Fry for an exhibition in London in 1910, which caused a massive scandal. It showcased artists like Paul CÃ©zanne, Paul Gauguin, and Vincent van Gogh.\n*   The Russian avant-garde movements, which Milyukov also criticized heavily (like the \"Jack of Diamonds\" group), were themselves deeply influenced by the French Post-Impressionists and Fauves. Therefore, criticizing the Russian avant-garde was, by extension, a criticism of its Western source.\n*   Milyukov, with his academic taste, would have viewed the subjective color, distorted forms, and emotional intensity of the Post-Impressionists as a betrayal of artistic tradition and a sign of cultural decay, fitting the \"stagnant swamp\" metaphor perfectly. The term \"Post-Impressionists\" fits the \"X-Y\" structure.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBy combining Milyukov's known cultural conservatism with the major artistic controversies of the early 20th century, we can confidently identify the group he was denouncing. His criticism was aimed at the radical new art movements emerging from the West.\n\nThe term \"X-Y\" is **Post-Impressionists**.\n\n<<<Post-Impressionists>>>"
