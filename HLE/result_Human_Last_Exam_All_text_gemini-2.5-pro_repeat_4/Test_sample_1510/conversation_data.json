    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 distinct two-dimensional crystallographic groups that describe all possible repeating patterns in a plane. They are formed by combining translations with point group operations (rotations and reflections).\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, the associated point group consists of the symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. It's what you see if you \"ignore\" the translational part of the symmetries. The point group determines the overall symmetry class of the pattern.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements it contains.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find how many of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group containing exactly two elements (i.e., order 2).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Point Groups of Order 2\n\nFirst, let's list the 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups and their orders:\n1.  **C1 (or 1):** Identity only. Order 1.\n2.  **C2 (or 2):** Identity and 180° rotation. **Order 2.**\n3.  **Cs (or m):** Identity and a single reflection. **Order 2.**\n4.  **C3 (or 3):** Rotations by 0°, 120°, 240°. Order 3.\n5.  **C4 (or 4):** Rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. Order 4.\n6.  **D2 (or 2mm):** 180° rotation and two reflections. Order 4.\n7.  **C6 (or 6):** Rotations by multiples of 60°. Order 6.\n8.  **D3 (or 3m):** A 3-fold rotation and three reflections. Order 6.\n9.  **D4 (or 4mm):** A 4-fold rotation and four reflections. Order 8.\n10. **D6 (or 6mm):** A 6-fold rotation and six reflections. Order 12.\n\nFrom this list, we can see that there are only two point groups of order 2: **C2** and **Cs**.\n\n### Step 3: Find Wallpaper Groups for Each Relevant Point Group\n\nNow we need to identify which of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to the point groups C2 and Cs.\n\n**A. Wallpaper groups with point group C2 (180° rotation):**\n*   There is only one wallpaper group whose highest order of rotation is 2-fold and has no reflectional symmetry.\n    *   **p2**: This group's symmetries consist of translations and 2-fold rotations. Its point group is C2.\n\n**B. Wallpaper groups with point group Cs (reflection):**\n*   These are groups that have reflectional symmetry but no rotational symmetry (other than the trivial 360° rotation). The reflectional symmetry can manifest as either a pure reflection or a glide reflection. For the point group, a glide reflection is treated as a simple reflection.\n    *   **pm**: This group has parallel lines of pure reflection. Its point group is Cs.\n    *   **pg**: This group has parallel lines of glide reflection. Its point group is also Cs.\n    *   **cm**: This group has alternating parallel lines of pure reflection and glide reflection. Its point group is also Cs.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Total Number of Groups\n\nFinally, we sum the number of groups we found in Step 3.\n*   Number of groups with point group C2 = 1 (p2)\n*   Number of groups with point group Cs = 3 (pm, pg, cm)\n\nTotal number of groups = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThese four groups are **p2, pm, pg, and cm**.\n\n<<<4>>>"
