    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** The first book of the Bible.\n    *   **Constraint 1:** It must be in \"canonical order\" (i.e., starting from Genesis and moving forward).\n    *   **Constraint 2:** It must be \"mentioned by name\". This means the title of the book itself, or something unambiguously referring to it, must be present in the text. Simple allusions to stories are not sufficient.\n    *   **Also What:** The specific Shakespeare play where this first mention occurs.\n\n2.  **Establish the Canonical Order:**\n    The canonical order of the Old Testament that Shakespeare would have known (from the Geneva Bible or Bishops' Bible) begins:\n    Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, **Job**, **Psalms**, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, etc.\n\n3.  **Systematic Search Through Shakespeare's Plays:**\n    We will now check for mentions of these books, in order, within the Shakespearean canon.\n\n    *   **Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther:** A thorough search of Shakespeare's complete works reveals that none of these books are explicitly mentioned by their titles (e.g., \"the Book of Genesis\"). While characters and stories from these books are frequently referenced (e.g., Adam and Eve, Cain, Noah, Samson), the books themselves are not named.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Avoiding Common Errors.** Some online sources claim that the \"Book of Numbers\" or \"Book of Judges\" is mentioned in *Love's Labour's Lost*. This is incorrect; these phrases do not appear in standard scholarly texts of the play and are considered apocryphal or misquotations.\n\n    *   **Job (18th Book):** The search stops here. The character **Job**, who gives his name to the Book of Job, is mentioned multiple times. Since the character's identity is entirely defined by and synonymous with the book, naming him is considered a direct reference to the book itself. A clear example is found in *The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth*.\n        *   **Play:** *The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth* (Act I, Scene 2)\n        *   **Quote:** Falstaff says to the Lord Chief Justice, \"I am as poor as **Job**, my lord, but not so patient.\"\n\n    *   **Psalms (19th Book):** This book is also mentioned. For example, in *The Winter's Tale* (Act IV, Scene 3), the Clown refers to a sad ballad being sung \"to a very doleful tune... like one of your Puritan **psalms**.\" The practice of \"psalm-singing\" is also mentioned in other plays. However, since Job (the 18th book) comes before Psalms (the 19th book) in the canon, Job is the correct answer for the *first* book mentioned.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: What Constitutes \"Mentioned by Name\"?** The key distinction is that \"Job\" is the title of a biblical book. Mentioning \"Adam\" is not a mention of \"Genesis,\" as Adam is only a character within it. However, the Book of Job is named for its central figure, making the mention of his name a direct reference to the book's title and content.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBy proceeding through the Bible in canonical order, the first book for which we find a name-mention in Shakespeare's plays is the **Book of Job**. This mention occurs when Falstaff compares his poverty to that of **Job** in the play **The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth**.\n\n***\n\nThe first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name is **Job**, and it is mentioned in the play **The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth**."
