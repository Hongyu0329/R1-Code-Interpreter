    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Movement - Cambré Derrière**\nA cambré is a bend of the body from the waist, in any direction. \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\" So, a cambré derrière is a backbend. The fundamental goal is to create a graceful arch in the upper and middle back while maintaining proper technique in the rest of the body.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Vaganova Method's Approach**\nThe Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, is known for its precision, strength, and logical progression.\n*   **Key Principle:** Stability and control.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** The bend is initiated from the upper back, lifting the sternum towards the ceiling. The most critical rule is that the **hips must remain directly over the feet**. They are not allowed to push backward as the upper body arches. This isolates the bend to the spine and requires immense core and back strength to prevent the lower back from compressing and to maintain balance. The line is pure and controlled, emphasizing spinal flexibility without altering the base of support.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Balanchine Method's Approach**\nThe Balanchine method (or style), developed by George Balanchine, is characterized by its speed, musicality, and dynamic, often off-balance lines.\n*   **Key Principle:** Line and dynamism.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** To achieve a visually deeper and more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine style allows or even encourages the **hips to be released backward**, moving behind the heels. This acts as a counterbalance, allowing the dancer to achieve a more extreme arch. It creates a different aesthetic line—a sweeping, broken line from head to hip to foot—compared to the Vaganova method's unbroken curve from the waist up.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices Based on the Comparison**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in arm and hand positions (port de bras) between the methods, this is not the primary, defining difference in the fundamental mechanics of the cambré derrière.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core mechanical difference. Vaganova insists on hips forward and square over the feet. Balanchine allows the hips to release backward. This fundamental difference in hip placement dictates the entire look, feel, and muscular execution of the movement.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is often faster, the tempo of a specific exercise like cambré is dictated by the musical accompaniment and the goal of the combination. Speed is not the defining technical difference between how the two styles execute this particular movement.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used, not the cause of the difference itself. The Balanchine version often *appears* to have a greater degree of backbend precisely *because* the hips are released. The more fundamental point of difference is the hip placement that allows for this.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head placement follows the line of the spine and the arms in a coordinated way. While there might be subtle stylistic nuances, it is not the main point of distinction compared to the radical difference in hip placement.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most significant and defining technical difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement of the hips. Vaganova prioritizes stability by keeping the hips forward, while Balanchine prioritizes a dramatic line by allowing the hips to release back.\n\n<<<B>>>"
