The bare Green's function in the frequency-energy eigenbasis, $G_0(k, \omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ as:
$G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta \, \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - \mu)}$
Here, $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal that enforces the correct time-ordering. The dependence is an inverse relationship where $\epsilon_k$ appears linearly in the denominator.
