    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Green's function, or propagator, describes the amplitude for a particle to travel from one spacetime point to another. The \"bare\" Green's function, $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a *non-interacting* system.\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, for a fermionic system, the Green's function is defined as a two-point correlation function of the fields, averaged over all possible field configurations weighted by the action of the system.\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x, t) \\bar{\\psi}(x', t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\psi(x, t)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(x', t')$ are the field operators (represented by Grassmann numbers in the path integral) that create/annihilate a particle.\n*   $\\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ is the functional measure over all possible field histories.\n*   $S_0$ is the action for the free, non-interacting system.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Action $S_0$ and Incorporate the Energy Eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$**\n\nThe action is the time integral of the Lagrangian, $S_0 = \\int dt \\, L_0$. For a non-interacting system, the Lagrangian density is given by $\\mathcal{L}_0 = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\partial_t - \\hat{H}_0)\\psi$, where $\\hat{H}_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian.\n\nThe problem states that $\\hat{H}_0$ has a set of known single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\{\\epsilon_k\\}$. This implies that there exists a basis of states $|k\\rangle$ (e.g., momentum eigenstates for a translationally invariant system) such that $\\hat{H}_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$.\n\nTo make the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ explicit, we must work in this energy eigenbasis. We perform a change of basis on our fields:\n1.  **Spatial Transformation:** Expand the field $\\psi(x, t)$ in the basis of eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | k \\rangle$:\n    $\\psi(x, t) = \\sum_k \\psi_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\n2.  **Temporal Fourier Transformation:** Transform from the time domain to the frequency domain:\n    $\\psi_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n\nSubstituting these into the action $S_0 = \\int dt d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x, t) (i\\partial_t - \\hat{H}_0) \\psi(x, t)$, the action becomes diagonal in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis. The operator $i\\partial_t$ becomes a multiplication by $\\omega$, and $\\hat{H}_0$ becomes a multiplication by its eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n\nThis form clearly shows that the kernel of the quadratic action in this basis is the simple function $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Green's Function by Evaluating the Path Integral**\n\nThe Green's function in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\langle \\psi_k(\\omega) \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\omega) \\rangle$. Because the action is quadratic, the path integral is a set of independent Gaussian integrals for each mode $(k, \\omega)$.\n\nThe general formula for a Gaussian integral over Grassmann variables with an action $S = \\sum_{ij} \\bar{\\eta}_i M_{ij} \\eta_j$ is:\n$\\langle \\eta_k \\bar{\\eta}_l \\rangle = (M^{-1})_{kl}$\n\nIn our case, the \"matrix\" $M$ is diagonal in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis, and from the expression for the action $iS_0 = i \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$, we can identify the matrix elements as $M_k(\\omega) = -i(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nThe inverse is simply:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = (M_k(\\omega))^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-i(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)} = \\frac{i}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Feynman Prescription ($i\\eta$) for Time-Ordering**\n\nThe expression above has a pole on the real axis at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. A proper definition of the time-ordered (Feynman) propagator requires a prescription for how to handle this pole during integration. This is achieved by adding an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\eta$, to the denominator. This small term correctly enforces causality by shifting the poles slightly off the real axis.\n\nThe sign of $i\\eta$ depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied relative to the Fermi level (with chemical potential $\\mu$).\n*   For an unoccupied state (a particle added above the Fermi sea, $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$), the pole is shifted to $\\epsilon_k - i\\eta$.\n*   For an occupied state (a hole created below the Fermi sea, $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$), the pole is shifted to $\\epsilon_k + i\\eta$.\n\nThese two cases can be combined into a single expression:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere $\\eta \\rightarrow 0^+$. This is the final expression for the bare Green's function.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Dressed:** This calculation is for the *bare* Green's function $G_0$ because it uses the non-interacting action $S_0$. In an interacting system, one would have a \"dressed\" Green's function $G$, which includes the effects of interactions, typically calculated using perturbation theory.\n2.  **Choice of Basis:** The simple functional dependence is only apparent in the basis where the single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ is diagonal (the energy-frequency basis). In real space, $G_0(x, t; x', t')$ is a complex superposition of all these modes.\n3.  **The $i\\eta$ Prescription:** The $i\\eta$ term is not a mere mathematical convenience; it is physically essential. It encodes the boundary conditions of the problem and ensures that positive-energy states propagate forward in time and negative-energy states (holes) propagate backward in time, which is the definition of the Feynman propagator.\n4.  **Fermions vs. Bosons:** The derivation shown is for fermions. A similar derivation for non-relativistic bosons yields an identical functional form. For relativistic bosons, the action involves a second-order time derivative, leading to a propagator that depends on $\\omega^2 - \\epsilon_k^2$. The question is general, but the dependence $1/(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ is the canonical answer for systems described by a Schrödinger-like equation.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0$ is the inverse of the operator $(i\\partial_t - \\hat{H}_0)$. By transforming to the basis where this operator is diagonal (the frequency-energy eigenstate basis), the operator becomes $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Therefore, the Green's function, being the inverse, must be proportional to $1/(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Including the necessary regularization for the pole gives the final functional form.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on a single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse linear relationship, found in the denominator of the expression for the propagator in the frequency-energy domain.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function in the frequency-energy eigenbasis, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ as:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nHere, $\\omega$ is the frequency, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal that enforces the correct time-ordering. The dependence is an inverse relationship where $\\epsilon_k$ appears linearly in the denominator.>>>"
