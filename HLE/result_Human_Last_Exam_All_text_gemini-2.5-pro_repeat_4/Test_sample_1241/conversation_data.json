    "This problem asks for the sum of steady-state probabilities $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$ for a system described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations. The steady state is the long-term behavior of the system, where the probabilities of being in each state no longer change with time.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the steady-state equations**\n\nIn the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $p_i = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} P_i(t)$. When the probabilities are constant, their time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$.\n\nApplying this condition to the given system of differential equations, we get a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1:\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the given rate constants**\n\nThe given values for the transition rates $\\lambda_{ij}$ are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nSubstituting these values into the algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_{0} + 0.65 p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 p_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) p_{1} + 0.392 p_{2} + 0.008 p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_{2} - 0.008 p_{3}$\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the system of equations**\n\nWe can solve this system by expressing $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 p_{0} = 0.65 p_{1} \\implies p_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_{1} = \\frac{650}{19} p_{1}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 p_{1} = (0.392 + 0.008) p_{2} \\implies 0.4 p_{1} = 0.4 p_{2} \\implies p_{2} = p_{1}$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 p_{2} = 0.008 p_{3} \\implies p_{3} = p_{2}$\n\nCombining the results from equations (3) and (4), we get $p_{3} = p_{2} = p_{1}$.\n\nSo, we have the following relationships:\n$p_0 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1$\n$p_2 = p_1$\n$p_3 = p_1$\n\n**Careful Point:** Note that equation (2) is linearly dependent on the others. We can verify this by substituting our findings:\n$0.019 (\\frac{650}{19} p_1) - (1.05)p_1 + 0.392(p_1) + 0.008(p_1)$\n$= 0.65 p_1 - 1.05 p_1 + 0.392 p_1 + 0.008 p_1$\n$= (0.65 - 1.05 + 0.392 + 0.008) p_1 = (-0.4 + 0.4) p_1 = 0$.\nThe equation is satisfied, confirming consistency.\n\n**Step 4: Use the normalization condition**\n\nNow we use the normalization equation (5) to find the value of $p_1$.\n$p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\nSubstitute the expressions in terms of $p_1$:\n$\\frac{650}{19} p_{1} + p_{1} + p_{1} + p_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) p_{1} = 1$\nTo add the numbers, we find a common denominator:\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + \\frac{3 \\times 19}{19}) p_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}) p_{1} = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} p_{1} = 1$\n$p_{1} = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the required probabilities**\n\nNow that we have $p_1$, we can find $p_0$.\n$p_0 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\n**Step 6: Compute the final answer**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which is $p_0 + p_1$.\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nThe numerical value is approximately $0.94625$. The exact fraction is $\\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe sum of the steady-state probabilities $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$ is calculated by summing the individual steady-state probabilities $p_0$ and $p_1$.\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\n<<<669/707>>>"
