    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific text—a \"book of manners\"—that was physically preserved in the same collection or manuscript as the poem \"Sir Launfal.\" This requires knowledge of the literary history and manuscript tradition of \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Correct \"Sir Launfal\"**\nThe question most likely refers to the Middle English romance *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. This is the version most commonly studied in the context of medieval manuscripts. There is a later poem, \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\" by James Russell Lowell (1848), but it would not have been preserved in a medieval manuscript alongside a period \"book of manners.\" Therefore, we will focus on Thomas Chestre's poem.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Manuscript**\nTo find what was \"preserved alongside\" *Sir Launfal*, we must identify the manuscript in which it survives. Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal* is preserved in a single, unique manuscript. This manuscript is known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, which is now housed in the British Library.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the Contents of the Manuscript**\nThe Cotton Caligula A.ii is a famous miscellany, meaning it contains a variety of different texts bound together. By examining the table of contents for this manuscript, we can find the other works it contains. Along with several other Middle English romances (like *Libeaus Desconus* and *Emaré*), the manuscript includes a text that fits the description of a \"book of manners.\"\n\n**Step 5: Identify the \"Book of Manners\"**\nWithin the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript, there is a poem on social etiquette and conduct. This type of work is known as a courtesy book or, as the question puts it, a \"book of manners.\" The specific title of this work in the manuscript is ***The Boke of Curtasye*** (often modernized as *The Book of Courtesy*). This text provides instruction on proper behavior, table manners, and the duties of a young man serving in a noble household.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the Final Answer**\n*   The poem *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre survives in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n*   This same manuscript also contains a text on etiquette and social conduct.\n*   This text is titled *The Boke of Curtasye*, or *The Book of Courtesy*.\n*   Therefore, *Sir Launfal* was preserved alongside *The Book of Courtesy*.\n\n<<<The Book of Courtesy>>>"
