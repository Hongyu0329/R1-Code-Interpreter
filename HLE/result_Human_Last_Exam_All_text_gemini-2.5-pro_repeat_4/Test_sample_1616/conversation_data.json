    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a historical sound change in English where a tense vowel (like the \"a\" in `sane`) becomes a lax vowel (like the \"a\" in `sanity`) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of the word).\n\n**2. Step-by-step analysis of each word:**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   The base word is `south`, which has a tense diphthong /aʊ/.\n    *   The derived word is `southern` (two syllables), where the vowel becomes the lax vowel /ʌ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** While laxing has occurred, the word only has two syllables. TSL requires three or more syllables. Therefore, this is not an example of TSL.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   The base word is `derive`, which has a tense diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   The derived word is `derivative` (de-riv-a-tive), which has four syllables. The vowel from `rive` is now in the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable and has become the lax vowel /ɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a classic example of TSL. The tense vowel /aɪ/ becomes lax /ɪ/ in the antepenultimate syllable.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   The base word is `serene`, which has a tense vowel /iː/ (the \"e\" sound).\n    *   The derived word is `serenity` (se-ren-i-ty), which has four syllables. The vowel from `rene` is now in the antepenultimate syllable and has become the lax vowel /ɛ/ (the \"e\" sound in \"serenity\").\n    *   **Analysis:** This is another classic example of TSL. The tense vowel /iː/ becomes lax /ɛ/ in the antepenultimate syllable.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   The base word is `please`, which has a tense vowel /iː/.\n    *   The derived word is `pleasant` (two syllables), where the vowel becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** Like `southern`, laxing has occurred, but the word only has two syllables. This type of shortening before a consonant cluster is not TSL.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   The related base form can be seen in `grateful`, with the tense vowel /eɪ/.\n    *   The derived word is `gratitude` (grat-i-tude), which has three syllables. The vowel in the first syllable, which is the antepenultimate syllable, is the lax vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an example of TSL. The tense vowel source /eɪ/ becomes lax /æ/ in the antepenultimate syllable.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   The etymological root is Old English `sceadu`, where the first vowel (`æ`) was already short and lax.\n    *   The modern word `shadow` has two syllables. The first vowel is /æ/, which is lax.\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has not undergone TSL for two key reasons. First, it only has two syllables. Second, and more importantly, the vowel in its first syllable was never tense to begin with, so it could not have been \"laxed.\" It was always lax.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nWhile `southern` and `pleasant` have also not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing (because they only have two syllables), they *have* undergone a different type of laxing process (tense vowel -> lax vowel). The word `shadow` is unique in this list because its stem vowel was never tense in the first place, so no laxing of any kind has occurred. It fails the conditions for TSL most fundamentally.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
