    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the definitions from the question.\n\n1.  **Finite Group (G):** A set with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element (`e`), every element has an inverse, and the set has a finite number of elements.\n2.  **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x` and `y` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be stated as the condition `S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset`, where `S \\cdot S = \\{s_1 s_2 \\mid s_1, s_2 \\in S\\}`.\n3.  **Maximum by inclusion Product-Free Set (M):** A product-free set `M` is called maximum by inclusion (or simply maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, if you add any element `g \\in G \\setminus M` to `M`, the resulting set `M \\cup \\{g\\}` is no longer product-free.\n4.  **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal product-free sets equals `G`. Let `\\mathcal{M}` be the collection of all maximal product-free sets in `G`. `G` is filled if `\\bigcup_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} M = G`.\n5.  **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. All finite abelian groups are nilpotent.\n\nThe goal is to identify all finite groups that are both nilpotent and filled.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of a product-free set.\n\nThe most critical point of the analysis involves the identity element, `e`, of the group `G`.\n\n*   Let's consider if the identity element `e` can ever belong to a product-free set `S`.\n*   According to the definition of a product-free set, if `x \\in S` and `y \\in S`, then `xy \\notin S`. This must hold for all pairs, including when `x = y`.\n*   Suppose `e` is an element of a set `S`. Let's test if `S` can be product-free. We can choose `x = e` and `y = e`. Both are in `S`.\n*   Their product is `xy = e \\cdot e = e`.\n*   For `S` to be product-free, this product, `e`, must not be in `S`.\n*   But we started with the assumption that `e` is in `S`. This is a contradiction.\n*   Therefore, the identity element `e` can never be an element of any product-free set.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the \"Filled Group\" condition.\n\n1.  From the analysis in Step 2, we know that `e \\notin S` for any product-free set `S`.\n2.  A maximal product-free set `M` is, by definition, a product-free set.\n3.  Therefore, the identity element `e` cannot be in any maximal product-free set `M`.\n4.  The union of all maximal product-free sets, `\\bigcup_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} M`, is a collection of elements from `G`, none of which can be the identity `e`.\n5.  This means the union of all maximal product-free sets is necessarily a subset of `G \\setminus \\{e\\}`.\n6.  The definition of a filled group states that this union must be equal to the entire group `G`.\n7.  This leads to the statement `G = \\bigcup_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} M \\subseteq G \\setminus \\{e\\}`.\n8.  For this to be true, `G` must be a subset of `G \\setminus \\{e\\}`. This would imply that the identity element `e` is not an element of `G` (`e \\notin G`), which contradicts the definition of a group.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion.\n\nThe definitions as stated in the problem lead to a logical contradiction for any group. No group `G` can be \"filled\" because the identity element `e` will always be missing from the union of its maximal product-free sets.\n\nThis applies to all finite groups, regardless of whether they are nilpotent or not. The condition of being nilpotent is irrelevant because no group whatsoever can satisfy the \"filled\" condition.\n\nTherefore, the set of finite filled groups is the empty set. Consequently, the set of finite filled nilpotent groups is also the empty set.\n\n***Note:*** *In some mathematical literature, a group is said to be \"filled\" or \"covered\" by its maximal product-free sets if the union is `G \\setminus \\{e\\}`. This is a different definition from the one given in the problem statement (\"fills G\"). Based strictly on the wording of the question, the conclusion that no such groups exist is the only logical one.*\n\n<<<There are no finite filled nilpotent groups.>>>"
