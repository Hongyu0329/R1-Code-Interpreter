    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We try to find a factorization by grouping terms.\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3) + (3x^2 + 18x - 6)$\nNotice the pattern in the coefficients of the first group and the second group.\nLet's try to factor out a common term. Notice that $x^2-2$ might be a factor.\n$3x^2 + 18x - 6 = 3(x^2+6x-2)$ - this doesn't look promising.\nLet's try another grouping:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 9x^3) - (2x^5 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^3(x^4 - 9) - 2x(x^4 - 9) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^3 - 2x)(x^4 - 9) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = x(x^2 - 2)(x^4 - 9) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow we can factor out the term $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2) [x(x^4 - 9) + 3]$\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2) (x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nSo, the polynomial $f(x)$ factors into two polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$: $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their Galois groups**\n\nThe roots of $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe polynomial $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3) are divisible by 3. The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\nSince $h(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\nTo determine which subgroup it is, we find the number of real roots of $h(x)$.\n$h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $h'(x)=0$, so $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\nLet's evaluate $h(x)$ at these critical points:\n$h(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)^{5/4} - 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(-36/5) + 3 < 0$.\n$h(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(9/5)^{5/4} + 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = -(9/5)^{1/4}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(36/5) + 3 > 0$.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $h(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots. The other two roots are a complex conjugate pair.\nA standard theorem states that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly two non-real roots has the symmetric group $S_p$ as its Galois group.\nHere $p=5$, so the Galois group of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G_h \\cong S_5$. The order of this group is $|S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field K**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields $K_g$ and $K_h$.\n$K = K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_5)$, where $\\alpha_i$ are the roots of $h(x)$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe group $G$ is equal to the direct product if and only if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe field $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension. The field $K_h$ contains a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\n$D = (-1)^{5(4)/2}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-4)^4(-9)^5) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\nFor $K_g \\subseteq K_h$, we would need $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This would require $-14863419 / 2$ to be the square of a rational number, which is clearly not the case.\nTherefore, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$. The order of $G$ is $|G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the normal subgroups of G**\n\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ such that $\\{1\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nLet $C_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$ are of two types:\n1.  **Product subgroups:** $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd C_2$ and $N_2 \\unlhd S_5$.\n    The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n    The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group), and $S_5$.\n    Excluding the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}\\times\\{e\\}$ (which corresponds to $L=K$) and the full group $C_2 \\times S_5$ (which corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$), we get the following proper non-trivial normal subgroups:\n    *   $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$. $|H_1| = 60$. Index $[G:H_1] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$. $|H_2| = 120$. Index $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_3| = 2$. Index $[G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$. $|H_4| = 2 \\times 60 = 120$. Index $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **\"Twisted\" or \"diagonal\" subgroups:** These subgroups are not direct products of subgroups of the factors. They arise from isomorphisms between factor groups of the components.\n    The only non-trivial factor group of $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    The factor groups of $S_5$ are $S_5/S_5 \\cong \\{e\\}$, $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$, $S_5/\\{e\\} \\cong S_5$, $A_5/A_5 \\cong \\{e\\}$, $A_5/\\{e\\} \\cong A_5$.\n    The only isomorphism between a factor group of $C_2$ and a factor group of $S_5$ is $\\phi: C_2/\\{e\\} \\to S_5/A_5$.\n    This gives rise to a normal subgroup $H_5 = \\{(c, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = c\\}$, where we identify $C_2$ with $\\{+1, -1\\}$. This is the kernel of the homomorphism $G \\to \\{+1,-1\\}$ defined by $(c, \\sigma) \\mapsto c \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$.\n    $H_5$ consists of pairs $(+1, \\text{even permutation})$ and $(-1, \\text{odd permutation})$.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: List the possible degrees**\n\nThe possible degrees of the normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of these normal subgroups:\n*   From $H_1$, degree is 4.\n*   From $H_2$, degree is 2.\n*   From $H_3$, degree is 120.\n*   From $H_4$, degree is 2.\n*   From $H_5$, degree is 2.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees is the set of these values.\nThe possible degrees are $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\nFinal check:\n- Degree 2 extensions correspond to normal subgroups of index 2. There are three such subgroups: $H_2, H_4, H_5$. The corresponding fields are $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D})$.\n- Degree 4 extension corresponds to the normal subgroup $H_1$ of index 4. The corresponding field is the compositum $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D})$.\n- Degree 120 extension corresponds to the normal subgroup $H_3$ of index 120. The corresponding field is $K_h$, the splitting field of $h(x)$.\n\nAll these degrees are possible.\n\nFinal list of possible degrees: 2, 4, 120.\n\n>>>\n2, 4, 120"
