    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\". In a fuzzy inference system, a rule has an \"IF\" part (antecedent) and a \"THEN\" part (consequent). The rule activation level refers to the result of applying the firing strength of the antecedent to the consequent fuzzy set. This is also known as the implication step.\n\n**2. Deconstruct the Given Information**\n\n*   **System Type:** The system uses an \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\". This is a very advanced type of fuzzy set that models a high degree of uncertainty. However, the problem provides simplified, crisp values, which means we can focus on the fundamental operation rather than the complex structure of a type-3 set.\n*   **Antecedent Firing Level:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This value represents the overall degree of truth of the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part) for a given input `x'`. It is the firing strength of the rule.\n*   **Consequent Membership:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This is the membership degree of a specific value `y_j` in the original consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` (the \"THEN\" part). It defines the shape of the output set before it is \"activated\" by the rule's firing strength.\n*   **Operation:** The problem specifies using a \"t-norm operation\" to combine the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership.\n\n**3. Identify the Careful Points**\n\n*   **Simplification:** The main point to be careful about is recognizing that the problem is a simplified representation. In a true interval type-3 system, both the antecedent firing level (`Phi_k(x′)`) and the consequent membership (`μG_k_j`) would be complex fuzzy sets (specifically, type-2 fuzzy sets), not single numbers. The calculation would be far more complex. The provision of single numbers (`0.7`, `0.9`) indicates that the question is testing the basic principle of rule activation.\n*   **Choice of T-norm:** A t-norm (triangular norm) is a class of functions used to model the logical AND operation in fuzzy logic. The problem does not specify *which* t-norm to use. The most common t-norms are:\n    *   **Minimum:** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   **Product:** `T(a, b) = a * b`\n    In the context of fuzzy rule-based systems, the **minimum** operator is the most standard and widely used t-norm for implication (rule activation), particularly in Mamdani-type inference systems. We will proceed using the minimum t-norm as the standard interpretation.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Operation**\nThe activation of the consequent set is calculated by applying the chosen t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the original consequent membership degree.\n\nActivation Level = T(`Phi_k(x′)`, `μG_k_j(y_j)`)\n\n**Step 2: Select the T-norm**\nAs discussed, we will use the most common t-norm, the minimum operator.\n\nActivation Level = `min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the Given Values**\nWe are given:\n*   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\nActivation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Result**\nThe minimum of 0.7 and 0.9 is 0.7.\n\nActivation Level = `0.7`\n\nThis result represents the membership value of `y_j` in the *new* fuzzy set that results from activating the rule. The original consequent set, which had a height of 0.9 at this point, is effectively \"clipped\" or \"chopped off\" at the level of the rule's firing strength, 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
