    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for Primitivity and Order\n1.  **Primitivity:** A character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ is primitive modulo $p^a$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n    We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be $6$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Primitive Characters for each Prime Power Factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters of a given order for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$. Let's denote the number of primitive characters modulo $m$ of order $d$ as $P(m, d)$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** For a prime $p$, a character modulo $p^a$ ($a \\ge 2$) is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo $p^{a-1}$. For $a=1$, a character is primitive if it's not the principal character (which has conductor 1). The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $k$ is $\\phi(d)$, provided $d|k$.\n\n1.  **Modulo $4 = 2^2$**:\n    *   The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$.\n    *   There is one character of order 1 (the principal character, conductor 1, not primitive) and one character of order 2.\n    *   The character of order 2 has conductor 4, so it is primitive.\n    *   $P(4, 2) = 1$.\n    *   For the lcm to be 6, the order of $\\chi_4$ must divide 6. Since its order must be 2, this condition is met.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (must be the primitive character of order 2).\n\n2.  **Modulo $9 = 3^2$**:\n    *   The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$.\n    *   The characters that are not primitive modulo 9 are those induced from modulo 3. The character group modulo 3 has order $\\phi(3)=2$, so the non-primitive characters have orders 1 and 2.\n    *   The primitive characters modulo 9 are those whose orders do not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. Since the possible orders divide $\\phi(9)=6$, the primitive characters must have orders 3 or 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $P(9, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $P(9, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$.\n\n3.  **Modulo $7$**:\n    *   The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n    *   All non-principal characters are primitive. We need characters whose order divides 6. All orders (2, 3, 6) divide 6.\n    *   $P(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $P(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $P(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n4.  **Modulo $11$**:\n    *   The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$.\n    *   All non-principal characters are primitive.\n    *   We need the order to divide 6. The common divisors of 10 and 6 (other than 1) is just 2.\n    *   So, we only need primitive characters of order 2.\n    *   $P(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1.\n\n5.  **Modulo $13$**:\n    *   The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n    *   All non-principal characters are primitive.\n    *   We need the order to divide 6. The common divisors of 12 and 6 (other than 1) are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   $P(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $P(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $P(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the results\nWe need to find the total number of combinations of these primitive component characters such that the lcm of their orders is 6.\nLet the orders of the chosen primitive characters be $(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$.\nFrom our analysis:\n*   $d_4 = 2$\n*   $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_{11} = 2$\n*   $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nLet's check the lcm condition: $\\text{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}) = 6$.\nThis condition is equivalent to:\n(a) The order of each component, $d_i$, must divide 6. (This is already incorporated in our selection of choices).\n(b) There must be at least one component whose order is divisible by 2.\n(c) There must be at least one component whose order is divisible by 3.\n\n*   Condition (b) is always satisfied because we must choose a primitive character $\\chi_4$, and its order is $d_4=2$.\n*   Condition (c) is always satisfied because we must choose a primitive character $\\chi_9$, and its order $d_9$ is either 3 or 6, both of which are divisible by 3.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Since any valid choice of primitive components has one component with order divisible by 2 and one with order divisible by 3, and all component orders are divisors of 6, the lcm of the orders will always be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_9$: $P(9,3) + P(9,6) = 2 + 2 = 4$\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_7$: $P(7,2) + P(7,3) + P(7,6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: $P(11,2) = 1$\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $P(13,2) + P(13,3) + P(13,6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$\n\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
