No, this approach is not valid because it fundamentally misunderstands the ecological function of mimicry.

The core function of a mimicry syndrome is to present a recognizable warning signal to potential **predators**. The success of the mimicry, and therefore the grouping of species into a "syndrome," is determined by how these predators perceive and generalize the signal. The primary predators of bumblebees are birds.

The proposed methodology has a critical flaw: it uses **human perception** as a proxy for **avian perception**. This is invalid for several key reasons:

1.  **Different Visual Systems:** Birds have tetrachromatic vision and can see ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas humans have trichromatic vision and cannot. Bumblebee color patterns often include UV components that are invisible to humans but are a crucial part of the signal for birds. Two species that appear identical to a human may look completely different to a bird.
2.  **Inaccurate Stimuli:** Standard photographs are designed for human vision and do not capture UV light. Therefore, the images shown to the undergraduates are an incomplete and potentially misleading representation of the signal that birds actually see.
3.  **Irrelevant Judges:** While the undergraduates are "untrained" in biology, their visual systems and cognitive processes are not those of a predator learning to avoid a sting. The "similarity" that matters is what causes a bird to generalize its avoidance behavior, not what a human ranks as visually similar in an abstract task.

Because the method fails to measure the warning signal as it is perceived by the relevant evolutionary agent (the predator), the resulting clusters would reflect human perceptual groupings, not the ecologically functional mimicry rings.
