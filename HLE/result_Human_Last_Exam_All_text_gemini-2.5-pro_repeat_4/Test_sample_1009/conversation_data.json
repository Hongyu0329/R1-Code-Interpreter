    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the described topological group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of the group G\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Topological group:** The group operations are continuous.\n2.  **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n3.  **First-countable:** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. This means the character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$.\n4.  **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n5.  **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** The space may not be $T_2$. This is a crucial detail.\n6.  **Goal:** Find the maximum possible weight of $G$, denoted $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group\n\nFor any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $H = G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group. Let $\\pi: G \\to H$ be the canonical projection map. The map $\\pi$ is continuous, surjective, and open.\n\nLet's examine the properties of $H$ based on the properties of $G$:\n*   **$H$ is a topological group.** This is a standard result.\n*   **$H$ is compact.** As the continuous image of a compact space $G$, $H$ is compact.\n*   **$H$ is first-countable.** Since $\\pi$ is an open map, the image of a local base at $e \\in G$ is a local base at the identity $eN \\in H$. As $G$ is first-countable, $H$ is also first-countable, so $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **$H$ is Hausdorff.** This is true by the construction of the quotient $G/\\overline{\\{e\\}}$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the weight of G to the weight of H\n\nLet's analyze the topology of $G$. Let $O$ be an arbitrary open set in $G$ and let $x \\in O$.\nSince $O$ is open, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of the identity $e$ such that $xU \\subseteq O$.\nBy definition, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}} = \\bigcap \\{V \\mid V \\text{ is an open neighborhood of } e\\}$.\nThis implies that $N \\subseteq U$.\nTherefore, $xN \\subseteq xU \\subseteq O$. The set $xN$ is the coset of $N$ containing $x$.\nThis shows that any open set $O$ in $G$ is a union of cosets of $N$. An open set is saturated with respect to the projection $\\pi$.\nThis means that the open sets in $G$ are precisely the preimages of the open sets in $H$. That is, a set $O \\subseteq G$ is open if and only if $O = \\pi^{-1}(V)$ for some open set $V \\subseteq H$.\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the topology of $G$ and the topology of $H$. If $\\mathcal{B}_H$ is a base for the topology of $H$, then $\\{\\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_H\\}$ is a base for the topology of $G$.\nConsequently, their weights are equal: $w(G) = w(H)$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the maximum possible weight of H\n\nNow the problem is reduced to finding the maximum possible weight of the compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group $H$. Let's use known cardinal inequalities for topological spaces.\n\n1.  **Arhangel'skii's Theorem for Hausdorff spaces:** For any Hausdorff space $X$, $|X| \\le 2^{L(X)\\chi(X)}$, where $L(X)$ is the Lindelöf number and $\\chi(X)$ is the character.\n    For our group $H$:\n    *   It is compact, hence Lindelöf ($L(H) = \\aleph_0$).\n    *   It is first-countable ($\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$).\n    Applying the theorem, we get:\n    $|H| \\le 2^{L(H)\\chi(H)} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n    So, any compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group has cardinality at most $\\frak c$.\n\n2.  **Relation between weight, density, and character:** For any non-discrete Hausdorff topological group $H$, the weight is given by $w(H) = d(H)\\chi(H)$, where $d(H)$ is the density of $H$.\n    *   Since $H$ is compact and Hausdorff, it cannot be discrete unless it is finite. If $H$ were finite, its topology would be discrete, making $\\chi(H)=1$ (unless $|H|=1$), but we know $\\chi(H)=\\aleph_0$. So $H$ is not discrete.\n    *   Using $\\chi(H)=\\aleph_0$, the formula becomes $w(H) = d(H) \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\max(d(H), \\aleph_0)$.\n\n3.  **Relation between density and cardinality:** For any Hausdorff space, the density is at most its cardinality, i.e., $d(H) \\le |H|$.\n\nCombining these facts:\n$d(H) \\le |H| \\le \\frak c$.\nThen, $w(H) = \\max(d(H), \\aleph_0) \\le \\max(\\frak c, \\aleph_0) = \\frak c$.\n\nSo, we have established that for any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be at most $\\frak c$.\n$w(G) = w(H) \\le \\frak c$.\n\n### Step 5: Show that the maximum weight $\\frak c$ is achievable\n\nTo prove that $\\frak c$ is the largest *possible* weight, we need to show that a group $G$ satisfying the given conditions can have weight $\\frak c$.\nBased on our analysis ($w(G)=w(H)$), this is equivalent to showing that there exists a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group $H$ with $w(H) = \\frak c$.\n\nThe existence of such a group is a non-trivial result from the field of topological groups, established in ZFC. For example, S. Koppelberg constructed a compact Boolean algebra whose Stone space is a compact Hausdorff space $H$ with $w(H)=\\frak c$ and $\\chi(H)=\\aleph_0$. Such a space (a generalized Cantor cube) has a natural group structure.\n\nLet's assume the existence of such a group $H$:\n*   $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with $w(H) = \\frak c$.\n*   From the relations above, this implies $d(H) = \\frak c$ and $|H| = \\frak c$.\n\nNow, let's construct our group $G$:\n*   Let $N$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (for example, a direct sum of cyclic groups). Endow $N$ with the indiscrete topology (the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $N$). $N$ is a compact, first-countable topological group.\n*   Define $G$ as the direct product $G = H \\times N$ with the product topology.\n\nLet's check if this $G$ satisfies all the conditions:\n1.  **Topological group:** The product of two topological groups is a topological group.\n2.  **Cardinality:** $|G| = |H| \\cdot |N| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n3.  **Compact:** The product of two compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem).\n4.  **First-countable:** $H$ is first-countable, and $N$ with the indiscrete topology is first-countable (a local base at any point is $\\{N\\}$). The product of two first-countable spaces is first-countable.\n5.  **Not Hausdorff:** Since $N$ is not Hausdorff (for $|N|>1$), the product $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the weight of this constructed group $G$:\nA base for the product topology on $G=H \\times N$ is given by sets of the form $U \\times V$, where $U$ is open in $H$ and $V$ is open in $N$. Since the only non-empty open set in $N$ is $N$ itself, a base for $G$ is given by $\\{U \\times N \\mid U \\text{ is in a base for } H\\}$.\nThis means $w(G) = w(H)$.\nSince we chose $H$ to have $w(H) = \\frak c$, the weight of our constructed group is $w(G) = \\frak c$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that the weight of any such group $G$ must be less than or equal to $\\frak c$. We have also shown that a weight of $\\frak c$ is achievable by constructing a valid group. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\frak c$."
