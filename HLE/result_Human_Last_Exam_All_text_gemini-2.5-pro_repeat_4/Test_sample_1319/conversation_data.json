    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the primary mountain and the scope of the question.\nThe question asks for the tallest *historical* mountain mentioned in the *Iliad*, explicitly excluding Mount Olympus. This means we must first identify all the real-world mountains named in the epic poem and then compare their modern-day elevations. Mount Olympus, the home of the gods, is the tallest mountain in Greece at approximately 2,918 meters (9,573 ft) and serves as our benchmark for first place.\n\n### Step 2: Search the text of the *Iliad* for mentions of other mountains.\nA thorough review of the *Iliad* reveals several named mountains or mountainous locations that are significant to the narrative.\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is mentioned frequently. It is located near Troy (in modern-day Turkey) and serves as a viewpoint for Zeus to watch the Trojan War. Its highest peak is called Gargarus.\n    *   *Mention:* In Book 8, Zeus travels to \"many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts... to Gargarus.\"\n*   **The Peak of Samothrace:** The island of Samothrace has a prominent mountain from which Poseidon watches the battle.\n    *   *Mention:* In Book 13, Poseidon \"sat and marvelled at the war and the fighting, on the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace.\"\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly, Greece, is famous as the source of the ash-wood for Achilles' spear.\n    *   *Mention:* In Book 16, Achilles' spear is described as \"the Pelian ash, which Cheiron had given to his dear father from the peak of Pelion.\"\n*   **Mount Athos:** This mountain is mentioned as a landmark during the goddess Hera's journey from Olympus to Mount Ida.\n    *   *Mention:* In Book 14, Hera's magical flight takes her over \"the snowy mountains of the horse-rearing Thracians... and from Athos she passed over the surging sea.\"\n\n**Careful Point:** Some might think of Mount Ossa, often associated with Pelion in the myth where giants piled Pelion on Ossa to reach Olympus. However, this myth is detailed in the *Odyssey* (Book 11), not the *Iliad*. Mount Ossa is not explicitly named in the *Iliad*.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the modern names and elevations of the candidate mountains.\nNow we need to find the heights of the mountains identified in Step 2.\n\n1.  **Mount Ida (Turkey):** Today known as **Kaz Dağı**. Its elevation is approximately **1,774 meters (5,820 ft)**.\n2.  **Peak of Samothrace:** The mountain on the island is named **Mount Fengari** (or Saos). Its elevation is approximately **1,611 meters (5,285 ft)**.\n3.  **Mount Pelion (Greece):** Retains its name, **Pelion** (Pilio). Its highest peak is Stavrovouni, with an elevation of approximately **1,624 meters (5,328 ft)**.\n4.  **Mount Athos (Greece):** Retains its name, **Mount Athos**. Its elevation is approximately **2,033 meters (6,670 ft)**.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the elevations to find the tallest.\nLet's list the candidates in order of height:\n\n1.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters\n2.  **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters\n3.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters\n4.  **Mount Fengari (Samothrace):** 1,611 meters\n\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest of these historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Athos.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is Mount Athos. It is mentioned in Book 14 as a landmark on Hera's journey. With an elevation of 2,033 meters (6,670 ft), it is taller than the other contenders mentioned in the epic, such as Mount Ida (1,774 m), Mount Pelion (1,624 m), and Mount Fengari on Samothrace (1,611 m).\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
