    "Answering the user's request to solve for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Understanding the Equation**: The equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$. The main complexity lies in the term $i^z$, which is a multi-valued complex exponentiation.\n    *   **Careful Point 1**: The term $a^b$ for complex $a,b$ is defined as $e^{b \\log a}$. The complex logarithm $\\log a$ is multi-valued.\n    *   Let's define the branches of $\\log i$. The general form of the complex logarithm is $\\log w = \\ln|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   For $w=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\operatorname{Arg}(i) = \\pi/2$.\n    *   So, $\\log i = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\n    *   Let's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then $\\log i = iC_k$.\n    *   The equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\log i} = e^{z \\cdot iC_k}$.\n\n2.  **Simplifying Transformation**: To make the equation more manageable, we can use a substitution. Let $z = -iw$.\n    *   Substituting $z = -iw$ into the equation:\n        $(-iw) \\cdot i = i^{-iw}$\n    *   LHS: $-i^2w = -(-1)w = w$.\n    *   RHS: $i^{-iw} = (i^i)^{-w} = (e^{i \\log i})^{-w}$. Using the branch $k$ for $\\log i$, we get:\n        $(e^{i \\cdot iC_k})^{-w} = (e^{-C_k})^{-w} = e^{wC_k}$.\n    *   The transformed equation is $w = e^{wC_k}$. This is a more standard form to analyze. Note that for each integer $k$, we get a different equation.\n\n3.  **Solving the Transformed Equation**: We need to solve $w = e^{wC_k}$ for $w \\in \\mathbb{C}$ for each $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Let $w = u+iv$, where $u,v \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   $u+iv = e^{(u+iv)C_k} = e^{uC_k}e^{ivC_k} = e^{uC_k}(\\cos(vC_k) + i\\sin(vC_k))$.\n    *   Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get a system of two equations for $u$ and $v$:\n        (1) $u = e^{uC_k} \\cos(vC_k)$\n        (2) $v = e^{uC_k} \\sin(vC_k)$\n\n4.  **Casework based on the nature of the solution `z`**: The original variable is $z=x+iy = -i(u+iv) = v-iu$.\n    *   This means the real part of $z$ is $x=v$, and the imaginary part is $y=-u$.\n    *   We can now analyze solutions based on $u$ and $v$.\n\n    *   **Case A: Real solutions for `z` ($y=0$)**\n        This corresponds to $u=0$.\n        The system becomes:\n        (1) $0 = e^0 \\cos(vC_k) \\implies \\cos(vC_k) = 0$.\n        (2) $v = e^0 \\sin(vC_k) \\implies v = \\sin(vC_k)$.\n        From $\\cos(vC_k)=0$, we have $vC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n        This implies $|\\sin(vC_k)|=1$, so from (2), $|v|=1$, meaning $v=1$ or $v=-1$.\n        If $v=1$: We need $1 = \\sin(C_k)$. This requires $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2m\\pi$ for some integer $m$. Since $C_k=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi$, this is satisfied if we choose $m=k$. Thus $v=1$ is a valid solution for any branch $k$. This gives $z=v-iu = 1-i(0) = 1$.\n        If $v=-1$: We need $-1 = \\sin(-C_k) = -\\sin(C_k)$, so $\\sin(C_k)=1$. This is the same condition as for $v=1$. Thus $v=-1$ is also a valid solution for any branch $k$. This gives $z=v-iu = -1-i(0) = -1$.\n        So, $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are solutions.\n\n    *   **Case B: Purely imaginary solutions for `z` ($x=0$)**\n        This corresponds to $v=0$.\n        The system becomes:\n        (1) $u = e^{uC_k} \\cos(0) \\implies u = e^{uC_k}$.\n        (2) $0 = e^{uC_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0=0$. This is always satisfied.\n        We need to solve the transcendental equation $u = e^{uC_k}$ for real $u$. This is equivalent to solving $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for $y=-u$.\n        Let's analyze $f(u) = e^{uC_k} - u$.\n        If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi > 0$. The minimum value of $f(u)$ can be found to be positive, so there are no real solutions for $u$.\n        If $k < 0$, then $C_k < 0$. The function $f(u)$ is strictly decreasing, and it goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, so there is exactly one real root $u_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n        The equation $u=e^{uC_k}$ can be solved using the Lambert W function. Let $\\alpha = -uC_k$. The equation becomes $\\alpha e^{\\alpha} = -C_k$. The solution is $\\alpha = W(-C_k)$.\n        So, $-uC_k = W(-C_k) \\implies u_k = -\\frac{W(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n        The corresponding $z$ solution is $z = v - iu = 0 - i u_k = i \\frac{W(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n        Since $k \\le -1$, $C_k < 0$, so $-C_k > 0$. We can write $-C_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) = 2|k|\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n        The solutions are $z_k = i \\frac{W(2|k|\\pi - \\pi/2)}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$ for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$.\n\n    *   **Case C: Other complex solutions ($x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0$)**\n        This corresponds to $u \\neq 0, v \\neq 0$.\n        The equation $w=e^{wC_k}$ can be rewritten as $\\zeta e^{-\\zeta} = C_k$, where $\\zeta = wC_k$.\n        It is a known result from complex analysis that for any non-zero complex number $C_k$, the equation $\\zeta e^{-\\zeta}=C_k$ has infinitely many complex solutions for $\\zeta$.\n        Each solution $\\zeta$ gives a solution $w = \\zeta/C_k$ and thus a solution $z=-iw = -i\\zeta/C_k$.\n        These solutions are distinct from the ones found in Cases A and B (which correspond to $\\zeta$ being purely imaginary or real, respectively).\n        For every integer value of $k$, a new infinite family of complex solutions arises. Describing them requires expressing the roots of $\\zeta e^{-\\zeta} = C_k$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ has multiple families of solutions, due to the multi-valued nature of complex exponentiation $i^z = e^{z \\log i}$, where $\\log i = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe solutions are categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **Real Solutions**: There are two real solutions which satisfy the equation for any choice of branch $k$:\n    *   $z=1$\n    *   $z=-1$\n\n2.  **Purely Imaginary Solutions**: There is an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions, with one solution for each integer $k \\le -1$. These solutions are given by:\n    *   $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(2|k|\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$\n    (where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function, defined by $W_0(x)e^{W_0(x)}=x$).\n    For example, for $k=-1$, the solution is $z_{-1} = i \\frac{W_0(3\\pi/2)}{-3\\pi/2}$.\n\n3.  **Other Complex Solutions**: For each integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there exists an infinite family of complex solutions $z=x+iy$ where $x\\neq 0$ and $y\\neq 0$. These solutions can be expressed in terms of the complex roots of the equation $\\zeta e^{-\\zeta} = C_k$, where $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. For each root $\\zeta_j$ of this equation, a solution to the original problem is given by $z_j = -i \\frac{\\zeta_j}{C_k}$. The previously listed real and imaginary solutions are special cases of this general form where $\\zeta_j$ is purely imaginary or real, respectively.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are given by the following sets:\n1. Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2. An infinite series of purely imaginary solutions: $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(2|k|\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n3. For each integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there is an infinite family of complex solutions of the form $z = -i\\frac{\\zeta}{C_k}$, where $C_k=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi$ and $\\zeta$ is a complex number satisfying $\\zeta e^{-\\zeta}=C_k$. The real and purely imaginary solutions above are special cases of this form.\n>>>"
