The solutions for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ are given by the following sets:
1. Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.
2. An infinite series of purely imaginary solutions: $z_k = i \frac{W_0(2|k|\pi - \frac{\pi}{2})}{\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi}$ for each integer $k \le -1$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
3. For each integer $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, there is an infinite family of complex solutions of the form $z = -i\frac{\zeta}{C_k}$, where $C_k=\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi$ and $\zeta$ is a complex number satisfying $\zeta e^{-\zeta}=C_k$. The real and purely imaginary solutions above are special cases of this form.
