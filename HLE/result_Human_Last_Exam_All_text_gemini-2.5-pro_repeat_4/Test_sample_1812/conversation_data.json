    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The question asks to compute the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Analyze the Contextual Information:** The question mentions this matrix is the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n    *   **Careful Point:** It's crucial to examine if the matrix entries depend on this information. The matrix `A` is given with constant integer values. Its entries do not contain \\( m_{1/2} \\) or any other variable. Therefore, the information about the \"Markov quiver\" and the specific value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) is extraneous context that does not affect the calculation. The problem simplifies to finding the determinant of the given constant matrix.\n\n3.  **Choose a Method for Calculating the Determinant:** There are several standard methods to find the determinant of a matrix.\n    *   Method A: Using properties of determinants (e.g., linear dependence of rows/columns).\n    *   Method B: Direct computation using the cofactor expansion or Sarrus's rule.\n    *   Method C: Finding the eigenvalues and multiplying them.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nWe will demonstrate the two most direct methods.\n\n**Method A: Using Linear Dependence**\n\n1.  **Examine the rows and columns of the matrix `A`.** A key property of a matrix that leads to a zero determinant is having linearly dependent rows or columns.\n2.  **Perform a column operation.** Let's add the second and third columns to the first column. The determinant of a matrix does not change when we add a multiple of one column to another. Let the columns be \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\). We perform the operation \\(C_1' = C_1 + C_2 + C_3\\).\n    *   The new first column \\(C_1'\\) will be:\n        \\[\n        \\begin{pmatrix} 2 + (-1) + (-1) \\\\ -1 + 2 + (-1) \\\\ -1 + (-1) + 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n        \\]\n3.  **The new matrix becomes:**\n    \\[\n    A' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    0 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    0 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n4.  **Calculate the determinant of the new matrix.** The determinant of a matrix with a column of zeros is always 0. This can be seen by cofactor expansion along the first column:\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = \\det(A') = 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 2 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = 0\n    \\]\n    *   **Careful Point:** Recognizing this linear dependence is the quickest way to solve the problem. The sum of the entries in each row is zero (e.g., Row 1: 2 - 1 - 1 = 0), which implies that the vector \\([1, 1, 1]^T\\) is in the null space of the matrix, meaning it is singular and its determinant is zero.\n\n**Method B: Direct Computation (Sarrus's Rule)**\n\n1.  **Apply the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:**\n    \\[\n    \\det\\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix} = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n    \\]\n2.  **Substitute the values from matrix `A`:**\n    *   a=2, b=-1, c=-1\n    *   d=-1, e=2, f=-1\n    *   g=-1, h=-1, i=2\n3.  **Calculate:**\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 2 - (-1) \\cdot (-1)) - (-1) \\cdot ((-1) \\cdot 2 - (-1) \\cdot (-1)) + (-1) \\cdot ((-1) \\cdot (-1) - 2 \\cdot (-1))\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (4 - 1) + 1 \\cdot (-2 - 1) - 1 \\cdot (1 - (-2))\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (3) + 1 \\cdot (-3) - 1 \\cdot (1 + 2)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\det(A) = 0\n    \\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix `A` is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
