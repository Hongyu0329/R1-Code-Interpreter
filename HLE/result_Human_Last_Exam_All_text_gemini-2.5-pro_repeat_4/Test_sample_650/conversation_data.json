    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initialization Step (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0;`: This is one assignment operation.\n    *   `x := n;`: This is one assignment operation.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: This involves one division and one assignment.\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;`: This involves one multiplication, one subtraction, and one assignment.\n    *   All these operations are basic arithmetic and assignment operations. Assuming they each take a constant amount of time, the total time for Step 1 is constant. We can denote this as `O(1)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Loop (Step 2):**\n    *   The algorithm's runtime is primarily determined by the `while` loop, which continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   **Work per Iteration (Step 2.1):** Inside each loop iteration, the following operations occur:\n        *   `i := i + 1;`: One increment/assignment.\n        *   `x := q;`: One assignment.\n        *   `q :=. ⌊x/c⌋;`: One division and one assignment.\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc`: One multiplication, one subtraction, and one assignment.\n        *   Similar to the initialization step, the work done inside a single iteration of the loop is a fixed number of basic operations. Therefore, the time complexity of one iteration is constant, `O(1)`.\n    *   **Number of Iterations:** To find the total time complexity of the loop, we must determine how many times it executes. We need to track the value of `q`.\n        *   Let the input number be `n`. Before the loop starts, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   In the first iteration, `x` becomes the old `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(old q)/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   In the second iteration, the new `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    *   **Loop Termination:** The loop terminates when `q` is no longer greater than 0 (i.e., `q ≤ 0`). This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`. This condition is satisfied when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   To find the number of iterations, we solve for `k`. Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides of `n < c^(k+1)` gives `log_c(n) < k+1`. This means the loop runs approximately `log_c(n)` times. More precisely, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` for `n ≥ c`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Time Complexity:**\n    *   The total time `T(n)` is the time for the initial step plus the total time for the loop.\n    *   `T(n) = (Time for Step 1) + (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)`\n    *   `T(n) = O(1) + ⌊log_c(n)⌋ × O(1)`\n    *   `T(n) = O(log_c(n))`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Result:**\n    *   In Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm does not matter if it is a constant, because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c ≥ 2` is a constant, `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Constant factors are omitted in Big-O notation.\n    *   Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Input Size:** The complexity is a function of the input value `n`. The base `c` is considered a constant parameter of the problem.\n2.  **Dominant Operations:** The `while` loop is the dominant part of the algorithm. The number of times it runs determines the overall complexity.\n3.  **Cost of Arithmetic:** The analysis assumes that basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction) on numbers the size of `n` or smaller take constant time. This is a standard convention for this level of algorithm analysis. A more detailed bit-level complexity analysis would yield a higher complexity (e.g., `O((log n)²)`) but is not typically what is meant unless specified.\n4.  **Logarithm Base:** The number of iterations is directly related to `log_c(n)`, but for the purpose of Big-O notation, the constant base `c` is irrelevant, and the complexity is expressed as `O(log n)`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The value of `q` is divided by `c` in each step. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0 is given by `log_c(n)`. Since each iteration takes constant time, the total time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`. In Big-O notation, constant bases of logarithms are ignored, so the complexity is `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
