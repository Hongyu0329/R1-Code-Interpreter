    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n    *   **Setting:** The description of wide boulevards in Vienna.\n    *   **Clue:** The surname of an English poet appears within this description.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Puzzle Type:** The question is a linguistic riddle. The key is not a direct quote but a pun or a wordplay that occurs specifically in the Russian language. The surname of the English poet must sound like a Russian word used in the context of describing \"wide boulevards\".\n\n3.  **Analyze the Contextual Phrase:** The essay describes \"wide boulevards\". In Russian, the word for \"wide\" is \"широкий\" (shirokiy). A very common way to emphasize the width of something is to use the comparative form, \"wider,\" which in Russian is **\"шире\"** (pronounced roughly *shee-ryeh*).\n\n4.  **Find the Homophonic Surname:** Now, we need to find an English poet whose surname, when pronounced in Russian, sounds like the word \"шире\" (shire).\n    *   Let's consider famous English poets: Shakespeare, Keats, Byron, Wordsworth, Wilde, Shelley.\n    *   The surname of the poet Percy Bysshe **Shelley** is transliterated and pronounced in Russian as **\"Шелли\"** (pronounced roughly *Sheh-llee*).\n\n5.  **Connect the Pun:** The Russian word for \"wider\" (**шире**) and the Russian pronunciation of the name **Shelley** (**Шелли**) are extremely similar-sounding (near-homophones). Therefore, when a Russian text describes the boulevards of Vienna as being \"wider\" (\"шире\"), a reader could easily hear the name \"Shelley.\" This is the wordplay the question refers to.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The English poet whose surname appears in the Russian description is Shelley, due to the phonetic similarity between the Russian word for \"wider\" (шире) and his name (Шелли).\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the surname of the English poet is identified through a linguistic pun in the Russian language.\n\n*   The description involves Vienna's **wide** boulevards.\n*   The Russian word for \"wider\" is **шире** (*shire*).\n*   This sounds phonetically like the surname of the English poet **Shelley**.\n\nThus, the surname is Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
