    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the geometric condition**\n\nThe question asks for the number of integer values for the side length $AC$ under the condition that there are two possible values for the side length $AB$. This scenario describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines for a triangle, often referred to as the Side-Side-Angle (SSA) case.\n\nIn triangle $ABC$, let the side lengths be $a = BC$, $b = AC$, and $c = AB$. We are given:\n*   Side $a = BC = S$\n*   Angle $\\angle B = 30^\\circ$\n*   Side $b = AC$ is the side we are examining.\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles (and thus two possible lengths for side $c=AB$), the length of the side opposite the given angle ($b=AC$) must be greater than the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$, but less than the length of the other given side ($a=BC$).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the inequality for the ambiguous case**\n\nLet's find the length of the altitude, $h$, from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$. In the right triangle formed by this altitude, we have:\n$h = a \\sin(\\angle B)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$h = S \\cdot \\sin(30^\\circ)$\nSince $\\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$, the altitude is:\n$h = S/2$\n\nThe condition for two possible triangles is $h < b < a$.\nSubstituting the expressions for our triangle:\n$S/2 < AC < S$\n\nThis inequality gives the range of possible values for the length of side $AC$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the numerical value of S**\n\nThe problem states that $S = SNYWR$. This is likely a cipher where letters represent numbers. A common convention in such problems is to use the alphabetical position of each letter (A=1, B=2, C=3, ...). Let's find the values for the letters in SNYWR:\n*   S is the 19th letter of the alphabet.\n*   N is the 14th letter of the alphabet.\n*   Y is the 25th letter of the alphabet.\n*   W is the 23rd letter of the alphabet.\n*   R is the 18th letter of the alphabet.\n\nA plausible interpretation is that $S$ is the sum of these numerical values.\n$S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18$\n$S = 33 + 25 + 23 + 18$\n$S = 58 + 23 + 18$\n$S = 81 + 18$\n$S = 99$\n\n**Careful Point:** The interpretation of \"SNYWR\" is the most crucial assumption. Without a specific value for S, a numerical answer cannot be computed. The sum of alphabetical positions is a standard and logical interpretation for this type of problem.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of integer values for AC**\n\nNow we substitute $S=99$ into the inequality we derived in Step 2:\n$99/2 < AC < 99$\n$49.5 < AC < 99$\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of $AC$ that satisfy this condition.\n*   The smallest integer greater than 49.5 is 50.\n*   The largest integer less than 99 is 98.\n\nSo, the possible integer values for $AC$ are $50, 51, 52, \\dots, 98$.\nTo count the number of integers in this inclusive range, we use the formula: (Last Value) - (First Value) + 1.\nNumber of values = $98 - 50 + 1$\nNumber of values = $48 + 1$\nNumber of values = 49\n\nThus, there are 49 possible integer values for the side length $AC$.\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   The condition for two triangles is $S/2 < AC < S$. Correct.\n*   The value of $S$ is determined to be 99. This is a reasonable interpretation. Correct.\n*   The resulting inequality is $49.5 < AC < 99$. Correct.\n*   The integer count for this range is $98 - 50 + 1 = 49$. Correct.\n\nThe analysis is complete and all steps are logically sound based on the interpretation.\n\n<<<49>>>"
