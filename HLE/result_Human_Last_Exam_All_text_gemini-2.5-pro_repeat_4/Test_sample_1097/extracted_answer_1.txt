The set M should be defined as a closed ball of radius R centered at the zero function in the Banach space of continuous functions on `[0, 1]` with the supremum norm, `C[0, 1]`.
`M = {u ∈ C[0, 1] | ||u||_∞ ≤ R}`
where `R` is a positive constant chosen to satisfy the two conditions `exp(R) ≤ 8R` and `R < ln(8)`.
