    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximum number of fixed points for the function $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the problem mathematically.**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\nThe condition that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$ means that both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions.\nA fixed point of the composite function $f(g(x))$ is a real number $x$ such that $f(g(x)) = x$.\nWe want to find the maximum possible number of these fixed points.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the equation for fixed points.**\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The fixed points are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\nSince $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3 and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\nA fundamental theorem of algebra states that a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots.\nTherefore, the function $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 3: Check if it is possible to achieve 9 fixed points.**\nTo show that 9 is the maximum number, we must demonstrate that it is possible to construct polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) = x$ has 9 distinct real solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the problem in terms of constructing a suitable function.**\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We need to show that there exists a function $h(x)$ that meets the following criteria:\n1.  $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n2.  The equation $h(x) = x$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n3.  $h(x)$ can be expressed as a composition $f(g(x))$, where $f$ and $g$ are degree 3 polynomials with $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n\nThe conditions on $f$ and $g$ imply a condition on $h(x)$. Using the chain rule, the derivative of $h(x)$ is $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nSince $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, their product $h'(x)$ must also be positive for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ must be a strictly increasing function.\n\nSo the problem is reduced to this: can we find a strictly increasing polynomial $h(x)$ of degree 9 that has 9 fixed points and is a composition of two strictly increasing degree 3 polynomials?\n\n**Step 5: Construct a degree 9 polynomial with 9 fixed points.**\nLet's construct a polynomial $h(x)$ that has 9 distinct fixed points, say at $x = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 9$.\nConsider the polynomial $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-9)$.\nNow, define a function $h(x)$ as $h(x) = x + \\epsilon P(x)$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small non-zero constant.\nThe fixed points of $h(x)$ are the solutions to $h(x) = x$, which is $x + \\epsilon P(x) = x$, or $\\epsilon P(x) = 0$. The roots of this equation are precisely $x = 1, 2, \\ldots, 9$. So, $h(x)$ has 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure the constructed polynomial is strictly increasing.**\nFor $h(x)$ to be strictly increasing, its derivative $h'(x)$ must be positive for all $x$.\n$h'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x + \\epsilon P(x)) = 1 + \\epsilon P'(x)$.\nThe derivative $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, $P'(x) \\to +\\infty$. Therefore, $P'(x)$ must have a global minimum value. Let this minimum value be $m$. Since the roots of $P'(x)$ interlace the roots of $P(x)$, $P'(x)$ must take on negative values, so $m < 0$.\nTo ensure $h'(x) > 0$, we need $1 + \\epsilon P'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This is equivalent to satisfying the condition at the minimum of $P'(x)$, i.e., $1 + \\epsilon m > 0$, which means $\\epsilon m > -1$.\nIf we choose $\\epsilon$ to be a positive number, we need $\\epsilon < -1/m$. Since $m$ is negative, $-1/m$ is positive. So we can choose a sufficiently small positive $\\epsilon$ (for example, $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2|m|}$) to satisfy the condition.\nWith such a choice of $\\epsilon$, $h(x) = x + \\epsilon P(x)$ is a strictly increasing polynomial of degree 9 with 9 distinct fixed points.\n\n**Step 7: Decomposition of the constructed polynomial.**\nThe final step is to confirm that this polynomial $h(x)$ can be written as a composition of two degree 3 polynomials, $f(g(x))$, where both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing.\nA non-trivial theorem on polynomial decomposition (related to Ritt's theorems and results by Bass and Connell) states that any strictly increasing polynomial of degree $d^2$ can be decomposed into a composition of two strictly increasing polynomials of degree $d$.\nIn our case, $h(x)$ is a strictly increasing polynomial of degree $9 = 3^2$. According to this theorem, it can be decomposed into $h(x) = f(g(x))$, where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing polynomials of degree 3. A strictly increasing polynomial of degree 3 must have a derivative that is always non-negative. With a small perturbation (which doesn't change the number of roots), we can ensure the derivatives are strictly positive.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that it's possible to construct a function $f(g(x))$ satisfying all the given conditions that has 9 fixed points. Since a degree 9 polynomial equation can have at most 9 roots, the maximum number of fixed points is 9."
