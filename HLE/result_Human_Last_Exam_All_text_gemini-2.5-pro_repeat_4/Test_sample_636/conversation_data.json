    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are given a linear system with state matrix `A` and input matrix `B`. We need to design a state feedback controller with gain `F`. The control law is assumed to be `u = Fx`, which results in a closed-loop system `x_dot = (A + BF)x`. The goal is to choose `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Define the System and Gain Matrices**\n\n*   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe state vector `x` is 2x1, and the input vector `u` is 2x1. The feedback law `u = Fx` requires the gain matrix `F` to be a 2x2 matrix. Let's define `F` as:\n`F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ = -1 ± j`.\nThe characteristic polynomial for a system with these eigenvalues is:\n`p_desired(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_desired(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`p_desired(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`p_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**4. Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl = A + BF`**\n\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`\n`BF = [[1*f11 + 2*f21, 1*f12 + 2*f22], [1*f11, 1*f12]]`\n`BF = [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n\nNow, add `A` to `BF`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f11 + 2*f21, 1 + f12 + 2*f22], [1 + f11, f12]]`\n\n**5. Find the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M` is given by `λ^2 - trace(M)λ + det(M) = 0`.\nLet's find the trace and determinant of `A_cl`:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21) + f12 = f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21) * f12 - (1 + f12 + 2*f22) * (1 + f11)`\n\nThe resulting characteristic polynomial `p_cl(λ)` is:\n`p_cl(λ) = λ^2 - (f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1)λ + [(-1 + f11 + 2*f21)f12 - (1 + f12 + 2*f22)(1 + f11)]`\n\n**6. Match the Coefficients**\n\nWe now equate the coefficients of our calculated polynomial `p_cl(λ)` with the desired polynomial `p_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   **Coefficient of λ:**\n    `-(f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1) = 2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1 = -2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 = -1` (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Constant term:**\n    `(-1 + f11 + 2*f21)f12 - (1 + f12 + 2*f22)(1 + f11) = 2` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f11`, `f12`, `f21`, `f22`). This means the solution is not unique. We can simplify the problem by making a reasonable assumption.\n\n**7. Simplify and Solve for F**\n\nLet's assume a simpler structure for `F` by setting the second row to zero. This corresponds to using only the first control input for feedback.\nLet `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`.\nOur gain matrix becomes `F = [[f11, f12], [0, 0]]`.\n\nNow, our equations simplify significantly.\nFrom Equation 1:\n`f11 + f12 + 2(0) = -1`\n`f11 + f12 = -1` (Equation 1')\n\nFrom Equation 2, with `f21=0` and `f22=0`:\n`(-1 + f11)f12 - (1 + f12)(1 + f11) = 2`\n`-f12 + f11*f12 - (1 + f11 + f12 + f11*f12) = 2`\n`-f12 + f11*f12 - 1 - f11 - f12 - f11*f12 = 2`\n`-f11 - 2*f12 - 1 = 2`\n`-f11 - 2*f12 = 3` (Equation 2')\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `f11 + f12 = -1`\n2.  `-f11 - 2*f12 = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`(f11 + f12) + (-f11 - 2*f12) = -1 + 3`\n`-f12 = 2`\n`f12 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f12 = -2` back into Equation 1':\n`f11 + (-2) = -1`\n`f11 = 1`\n\nSo, the elements of the gain matrix `F` are `f11 = 1`, `f12 = -2`, `f21 = 0`, `f22 = 0`.\n\n**8. Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nLet's check if this `F` gives the correct eigenvalues.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThe roots of this equation are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)) / 2 = -1 ± j`. The verification is successful.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Feedback Law Convention:** The problem uses `A + BF`. In many textbooks, the convention is `A - BK`, where `u = -Kx`. Always follow the notation given in the problem statement.\n2.  **Matrix Dimensions:** Ensure all matrix multiplications and additions are dimensionally correct. Here, `A, B, F` and `BF` must all be 2x2.\n3.  **Non-Uniqueness of Solution:** For multi-input systems (where `B` has more than one column), the pole placement problem generally has infinite solutions for `F`. Making a simplifying assumption (like setting a row or column of `F` to zero) is a valid strategy to find one of these solutions.\n4.  **Characteristic Polynomial Calculation:** Using the formula `λ^2 - trace(M)λ + det(M)` for a 2x2 matrix `M` is quicker and less prone to algebraic errors than expanding `det(λI - M)`.\n5.  **Controllability:** A solution for `F` that places the eigenvalues arbitrarily is only possible if the system `(A, B)` is controllable. For this problem, `det(B) = -2 ≠ 0`, which means `B` is full rank, guaranteeing controllability.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
