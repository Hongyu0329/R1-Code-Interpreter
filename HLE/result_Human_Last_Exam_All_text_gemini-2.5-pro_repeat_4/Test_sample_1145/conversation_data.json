    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and the Governing Equations**\n\nThe problem concerns a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, commonly known as a \"particle in a box\". The box has a length 'a', extending from x=0 to x=a.\n\n*   The state of the particle is described by its normalized wavefunction, ψ_n(x), where 'n' is the principal quantum number.\n    ψ_n(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n*   The probability density of finding the particle at a position x is given by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n*   The probability of finding the particle within a specific interval [x₁, x₂] is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    P(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] |ψ_n(x)|² dx\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Specific Conditions from the Question**\n\nWe are given the following specific conditions:\n*   The quantum state is **n = 2**.\n*   The interval of interest is from **x₁ = 0.495a** to **x₂ = 0.505a**.\n\nSubstituting n=2 into the probability density function, we get:\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability we need to calculate is:\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Interval and the Function**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The interval is centered at x = (0.495a + 0.505a)/2 = 0.5a.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** For the n=2 state, the wavefunction has a node (a point of zero probability) at the center of the box, x = a/2. We can check this:\n    |ψ₂(a/2)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2π(a/2)/a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = (2/a) * 0² = 0.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The interval width is Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a. This is a very small interval.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** Since the interval is very small and centered on a node (a minimum of the probability density), we expect the probability to be very small but not exactly zero. A simple approximation P ≈ |ψ(x_center)|² * Δx would yield 0, which is inaccurate. We must perform the integration.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Integration (Approximation Method)**\n\nSince the interval is very small, we can approximate the probability density function near the node at x=a/2 using a Taylor series expansion.\n\n1.  The function to expand is f(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a)sin²(2πx/a).\n2.  Expand around x = a/2. We need to find the derivatives:\n    *   f(a/2) = 0 (as shown above).\n    *   f'(x) = (2/a) * 2sin(2πx/a) * cos(2πx/a) * (2π/a) = (4π/a²)sin(4πx/a).\n        At x=a/2, f'(a/2) = (4π/a²)sin(2π) = 0.\n    *   f''(x) = (4π/a²) * cos(4πx/a) * (4π/a) = (16π²/a³)cos(4πx/a).\n        At x=a/2, f''(a/2) = (16π²/a³)cos(2π) = 16π²/a³.\n3.  The Taylor expansion of f(x) around x=a/2 is:\n    f(x) ≈ f(a/2) + f'(a/2)(x - a/2) + (f''(a/2)/2!)(x - a/2)²\n    f(x) ≈ 0 + 0 + (1/2)(16π²/a³)(x - a/2)²\n    f(x) ≈ (8π²/a³)(x - a/2)²\n\n4.  Now, integrate this simplified parabolic function over the interval:\n    P ≈ ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (8π²/a³)(x - a/2)² dx\n\n5.  To make the integration easier, let u = x - a/2. Then du = dx. The new integration limits are:\n    *   Lower limit: u₁ = 0.495a - a/2 = -0.005a\n    *   Upper limit: u₂ = 0.505a - a/2 = +0.005a\n    P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (8π²/a³) u² du\n\n6.  Evaluate the integral:\n    P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [u³/3] evaluated from -0.005a to 0.005a\n    P ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\n    P ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [ (0.005)³a³ - (-(0.005)³a³) ]\n    P ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [ 2 * (0.005)³a³ ]\n\n7.  The a³ terms cancel out, as expected for a probability.\n    P ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Numerical Answer**\n\nNow, we just need to compute the value.\n\n*   P ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (0.005)³\n*   P ≈ (16 * (3.14159)² / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   P ≈ (52.638) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   P ≈ 6.57975 x 10⁻⁶\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the probability is 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nFinal check: The result is a small, positive, dimensionless number, which is physically reasonable for the probability of finding a particle in a tiny interval around a node. The steps are logical and the calculation is verified.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
