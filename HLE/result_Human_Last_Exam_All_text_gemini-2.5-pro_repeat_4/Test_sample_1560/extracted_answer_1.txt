The final state of the system depends on the probabilistic outcome of measuring one of the ququints (e.g., ququint A) in the computational basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle, |2\rangle, |3\rangle, |4\rangle\}$. There are five possible outcomes. If the measurement result for ququint A is the state $|k\rangle$ (where k is an integer from 0 to 4), which occurs with a probability of 1/5, the state of the entire two-ququint system collapses to the product state $|k\rangle_A \otimes |k\rangle_B$. Consequently, the state of the second ququint (ququint B) is determined to be $|k\rangle_B$. The states of the two ququints are perfectly correlated.
