    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant concepts\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_H^3$)**: This is an abelian group whose elements are equivalence classes of oriented homology 3-spheres. Two homology 3-spheres $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are equivalent (homology cobordant) if there exists a 4-manifold $W$ (a homology cobordism) with boundary $\\partial W = Y_1 \\sqcup -Y_2$ such that the inclusions induce isomorphisms on integer homology. The group operation is connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure that modifies the 3-sphere $S^3$ along a knot $K$. An integral surgery is specified by an integer $p$, and the resulting 3-manifold is denoted $S_p^3(K)$.\n3.  **Homology Sphere Condition**: For the resulting manifold $S_p^3(K)$ to be a homology 3-sphere, its first homology group, $H_1(S_p^3(K);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|p|\\mathbb{Z}$, must be trivial. This requires $|p|=1$. Thus, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n4.  **Knots with at most four crossings**: We need to list all knots with a crossing number of 4 or less. These are:\n    *   **0 crossings**: The unknot ($0_1$).\n    *   **1 or 2 crossings**: None.\n    *   **3 crossings**: The right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil ($m(3_1)$).\n    *   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$), which is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n\n### Step 2: List the homology spheres obtained by surgery\nWe perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of the identified knots.\n\n1.  **Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(0_1) = S^3$\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(0_1) = S^3$\n    Both surgeries result in the standard 3-sphere, which is the identity element in $\\Theta_H^3$. This gives us one element.\n\n2.  **Right-handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**:\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(3_1)$: This is orientation-reversingly diffeomorphic to the Poincar√© homology sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. Let's call this manifold $M_1$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(3_1)$: This is the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. Let's call this manifold $M_2$.\n\n3.  **Left-handed Trefoil ($m(3_1)$)**:\n    We use the standard relation $S_p^3(m(K)) \\cong -S_{-p}^3(K)$, where $-Y$ denotes the manifold $Y$ with the opposite orientation.\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(m(3_1)) \\cong -S_{-1}^3(3_1) = -M_2$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(m(3_1)) \\cong -S_{+1}^3(3_1) = -M_1$.\n    These give the inverse elements of those from the right-handed trefoil.\n\n4.  **Figure-eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, so $m(4_1) \\cong 4_1$.\n    *   Let $M_3 = S_{+1}^3(4_1)$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(4_1) \\cong -S_{+1}^3(4_1) = -M_3$.\n    This gives one new manifold and its inverse.\n\n### Step 3: Consolidate the list of elements and check for duplicates\nThe set of elements generated is $\\{[S^3], [M_1], [M_2], [-M_2], [-M_1], [M_3], [-M_3]\\}$. This simplifies to the set $\\{ [S^3], \\pm[M_1], \\pm[M_2], \\pm[M_3] \\}$. To determine if these elements are distinct, we use homology cobordism invariants. The most common are:\n*   **Rohlin invariant ($\\mu$)**: A homomorphism $\\mu: \\Theta_H^3 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   **Casson invariant ($\\lambda$)**: A homomorphism $\\lambda: \\Theta_H^3 \\to \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **Heegaard-Floer d-invariants ($d$)**: A homomorphism $d: \\Theta_H^3 \\to \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nWe will use the triple of invariants $(\\mu, \\lambda, d)$ to distinguish the elements. For an element $[Y]$, the inverse $[-Y]$ has invariants $(\\mu(Y), -\\lambda(Y), -d(Y))$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the invariants for each generating element\nWe use standard formulas for these invariants for surgery on a knot $K$:\n*   $\\mu(S_{\\pm 1}^3(K)) \\equiv \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$.\n*   $\\lambda(S_{\\pm 1}^3(K)) = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_K''(1)$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial.\n*   $d(S_{+1}^3(K)) = -2\\tau(K)$, where $\\tau(K)$ is the Ozsvath-Szabo knot concordance invariant.\n*   $d(S_{-1}^3(K)) = 0$ if $\\text{Arf}(K)=1$.\n\n**Knot Invariants:**\n*   **$0_1$**: $\\text{Arf}=0, \\Delta''(1)=0, \\tau=0$.\n*   **$3_1$**: $\\text{Arf}=1, \\Delta''(1)=2, \\tau=1$.\n*   **$4_1$**: $\\text{Arf}=0, \\Delta''(1)=2, \\tau=0$.\n\n**Manifold Invariants:**\n1.  **$[S^3]$**: The identity element. Invariants: $(\\mu,\\lambda,d) = (0,0,0)$.\n\n2.  **$[M_1] = [S_{+1}^3(3_1)]$**:\n    *   $\\mu = \\text{Arf}(3_1) = 1$.\n    *   $\\lambda = +\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{3_1}''(1) = 1$.\n    *   $d = -2\\tau(3_1) = -2$.\n    *   Triple: $(1, 1, -2)$.\n\n3.  **$[M_2] = [S_{-1}^3(3_1)]$**:\n    *   $\\mu = \\text{Arf}(3_1) = 1$.\n    *   $\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{3_1}''(1) = -1$.\n    *   $d = 0$ (since $\\text{Arf}(3_1)=1$).\n    *   Triple: $(1, -1, 0)$.\n\n4.  **$[M_3] = [S_{+1}^3(4_1)]$**:\n    *   $\\mu = \\text{Arf}(4_1) = 0$.\n    *   $\\lambda = +\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{4_1}''(1) = 1$.\n    *   $d = -2\\tau(4_1) = 0$.\n    *   Triple: $(0, 1, 0)$.\n\n### Step 5: List all generated elements and their invariants\nNow we list the distinct elements and their invariant triples:\n1.  **$[S^3]$**: $(0,0,0)$\n2.  **$[M_1] = [S_{+1}^3(3_1)]$**: $(1,1,-2)$\n3.  **$[-M_1] = [S_{-1}^3(m(3_1))]$**: Invariants are $(1, -1, 2)$.\n4.  **$[M_2] = [S_{-1}^3(3_1)]$**: $(1,-1,0)$\n5.  **$[-M_2] = [S_{+1}^3(m(3_1))]$**: Invariants are $(1, 1, 0)$.\n6.  **$[M_3] = [S_{+1}^3(4_1)]$**: $(0,1,0)$\n7.  **$[-M_3] = [S_{-1}^3(4_1)]$**: Invariants are $(0, -1, 0)$.\n\n### Step 6: Count the distinct elements\nWe compare the invariant triples to see if they are distinct.\n1.  $(0,0,0)$\n2.  $(1,1,-2)$\n3.  $(1,-1,2)$\n4.  $(1,-1,0)$\n5.  $(1,1,0)$\n6.  $(0,1,0)$\n7.  $(0,-1,0)$\n\nAll seven of these triples are unique. Since the invariants $(\\mu, \\lambda, d)$ are well-defined for homology cobordism classes, manifolds with different invariant triples must represent different elements in the group $\\Theta_H^3$. Therefore, these seven elements are all distinct.\n\nThe elements are represented by:\n1.  The 3-sphere $S^3$.\n2.  $+1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil.\n3.  $-1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil.\n4.  $+1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil (which is the inverse of element 3).\n5.  $-1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil (which is the inverse of element 2).\n6.  $+1$ surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n7.  $-1$ surgery on the figure-eight knot (which is the inverse of element 6).\n\nCounting these distinct elements, we find there are exactly 7."
