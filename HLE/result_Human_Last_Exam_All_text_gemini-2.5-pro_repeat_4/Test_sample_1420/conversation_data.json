    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Physical Quantity and the Context**\n\nThe question asks for the scaling exponent `α` (alpha) associated with the specific heat, `C_V`. Near a critical point, the singular part of the specific heat of a system behaves according to a power law:\n`C_V ∝ |t|^(-α)`\nwhere `t = (T - T_c) / T_c` is the reduced temperature, and `T_c` is the critical temperature. The value of `α` is a critical exponent.\n\nThe method to be used is the **epsilon (ϵ) expansion**, a key technique in the **renormalization group (RG) theory** of critical phenomena.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Upper Critical Dimension (`d_c`)**\n\nThe epsilon expansion is a perturbative method performed around the **upper critical dimension**, `d_c`. This is the dimension above which the critical exponents take on their simple, classical mean-field theory values. For a wide class of systems described by the `O(n)` symmetric φ⁴ theory (which includes the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is:\n`d_c = 4`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The value of `d_c` depends on the nature of the interactions in the system. For standard ferromagnetic models with short-range interactions, `d_c = 4`.\n\n**Step 3: Defining the Expansion Parameter `ϵ`**\n\nThe epsilon expansion treats the deviation from the upper critical dimension as a small parameter, `ϵ`. It is defined as:\n`ϵ = d_c - d`\n\nThe problem specifies a spatial dimension `d = 3`. Therefore, the value of `ϵ` for this calculation is:\n`ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The epsilon expansion is formally an asymptotic series in `ϵ`. Using it for `ϵ = 1` is a significant extrapolation, as `1` is not infinitesimally small. However, this procedure often yields remarkably good approximations for critical exponents in `d=3` and is a standard technique.\n\n**Step 4: Using Hyperscaling and the RG Results for Exponents**\n\nWithin the RG framework, the critical exponents are not all independent but are related by so-called **hyperscaling relations**. The relevant relation for `α` is:\n`α = 2 - dν`\nwhere `ν` (nu) is the critical exponent for the correlation length `ξ` (`ξ ∝ |t|^(-ν)`).\n\nThe epsilon expansion provides expressions for the exponents as a power series in `ϵ`. The result for `ν` to the first order in `ϵ` for the `O(n)` model (where `n` is the number of spin components) is a classic result:\n`ν = 1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n\nNow, we substitute `d = 4 - ϵ` and the expression for `ν` into the hyperscaling relation to find `α`. We only need to work to the first order in `ϵ`.\n\n`α = 2 - (4 - ϵ) * ν`\n`α = 2 - (4 - ϵ) * [1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)]`\n\nExpanding the product and keeping terms up to order `ϵ`:\n`α = 2 - [4 * (1/2) + 4 * ((n+2) / (4(n+8))) * ϵ - ϵ * (1/2) + O(ϵ²)]`\n`α = 2 - [2 + (n+2) / (n+8) * ϵ - 1/2 * ϵ + O(ϵ²)]`\n`α = - [(n+2) / (n+8) - 1/2] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n\nCombining the terms inside the bracket:\n`α = - [(2(n+2) - (n+8)) / (2(n+8))] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n`α = - [(2n + 4 - n - 8) / (2(n+8))] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n`α = - [(n - 4) / (2(n+8))] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n`α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n\nThis is the general first-order result for `α` in the epsilon expansion.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Numerical Value for `d=3`**\n\nTo get the final answer, we need to substitute `ϵ = 1` and choose a value for `n`.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The question does not specify the system's symmetry (i.e., the value of `n`). In such cases, the standard convention is to use the simplest and most common model, which is the **Ising model**. The Ising model has a single spin component, so:\n`n = 1`\n\nSubstituting `ϵ = 1` and `n = 1` into our formula for `α`:\n`α = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8))`\n`α = 3 / (2 * 9)`\n`α = 3 / 18`\n`α = 1/6`\n\nAs a decimal, this is approximately `0.167`. This is the result for the specific heat exponent `α` in `d=3` as calculated from the first-order epsilon expansion for the Ising model universality class.\n\n(For completeness, for the XY model, n=2, `α = (4-2)/(2(2+8)) = 2/20 = 0.1`. For the Heisenberg model, n=3, `α = (4-3)/(2(3+8)) = 1/22 ≈ 0.045`.)\n\nSince the question asks for \"the\" scaling exponent, the most standard answer corresponds to the Ising model (`n=1`).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation Summary\n\n1.  **Identify parameters**: `d=3`, `d_c=4`, so `ϵ = d_c - d = 1`.\n2.  **Recall/Derive formula**: The first-order epsilon expansion gives `α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ϵ`.\n3.  **Specify model**: Assume the Ising model, `n=1`, as is standard when not specified.\n4.  **Calculate**: Substitute `n=1` and `ϵ=1` into the formula: `α = (4-1) / (2(1+8)) = 3/18 = 1/6`.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
