    "This problem asks for the computation of the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$. This is generally interpreted in the literature as finding the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number, denoted here as $\\alpha_{4/7}$, whose properties are linked to $m_{4/7}$ through the theory of the Markov and Lagrange spectra. The construction of the continued fraction of $\\alpha_{p/q}$ from the continued fraction of the rational number $p/q$ is a standard procedure in this field.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to compute this continued fraction.\n\n### Step 1: Find the continued fraction of the rational number 4/7\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the simple continued fraction of 4/7.\n1.  Start with the fraction 4/7. Since it's less than 1, the first term is 0. We then work with its reciprocal, 7/4.\n    $ \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} $\n2.  Now we take the reciprocal of the remainder, 3/4, which is 4/3.\n    $ \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} $\n3.  Finally, we take the reciprocal of the new remainder, 1/3, which is 3.\n    $ \\frac{3}{1} = 3 $\n\nThe sequence of integer parts gives the coefficients of the continued fraction.\nTherefore, the continued fraction for 4/7 is:\n$ \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] $\nWe denote the coefficients as $(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3)$. The length of the sequence of coefficients is $n=3$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The simple continued fraction for a rational number is unique if we require the last term to be greater than 1. For example, $[0; 1, 1, 3]$ is equivalent to $[0; 1, 1, 2, 1]$, but the standard form is the one with the shorter length. We will use the standard form $[0; 1, 1, 3]$.\n\n### Step 2: Construct the block sequence S\n\nNext, we use a standard construction rule (often attributed to Cohn or Freiman) to convert the sequence of coefficients $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$ into a new sequence of blocks, which will form the period of the final continued fraction.\n\nThe rule for creating a block $S_i$ from a coefficient $a_i$ is as follows:\n*   If $a_i = 1$, the block $S_i$ is $(1, 1)$.\n*   If $a_i > 1$, the block $S_i$ is formed by $a_i - 1$ twos, followed by $(1, 1)$. That is, $S_i = (\\underbrace{2, \\dots, 2}_{a_i-1 \\text{ times}}, 1, 1)$.\n\nApplying this rule to our coefficients $(1, 1, 3)$:\n*   For $a_1 = 1$: $S_1 = (1, 1)$.\n*   For $a_2 = 1$: $S_2 = (1, 1)$.\n*   For $a_3 = 3$: Since $3 > 1$, the block $S_3$ consists of $3-1=2$ twos, followed by $(1,1)$. So, $S_3 = (2, 2, 1, 1)$.\n\nNow, we concatenate these blocks to form the main sequence $S$:\n$S = S_1 S_2 S_3 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1)$.\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the final continued fraction\n\nThe final step is to assemble the periodic part of the continued fraction for $\\alpha_{4/7}$ using the sequence $S$ and its reverse, $S^R$. The rule for this assembly depends on the parity of $n$ (the number of coefficients in the continued fraction of the rational number).\n\n*   If $n$ is even, the continued fraction is $[0; \\overline{S, S^R}]$.\n*   If $n$ is odd, the continued fraction is $[0; \\overline{S, 2, S^R}]$.\n\nIn our case, for $4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]$, we have $n=3$, which is an odd number. Therefore, we use the rule for odd $n$.\n\nFirst, let's find the reverse of $S$:\n$S = (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1)$\n$S^R = (1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1)$\n\nNow, we form the periodic part by concatenating $S$, the number 2, and $S^R$:\nPeriod = $(S, 2, S^R) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1)$\n\nThe final continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$ is:\n$[0; \\overline{1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1}]$\n\n**Careful Point:** Different authors may present slightly different, though related, construction rules. The rule used here is a widely cited standard in the literature (e.g., as found on MathWorld, citing works by Cohn and Gbur).\n\nThe final answer is the continued fraction representation.\n$[0; \\overline{1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1}]$\n\n<<<[0; \\overline{1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1}]>>>"
