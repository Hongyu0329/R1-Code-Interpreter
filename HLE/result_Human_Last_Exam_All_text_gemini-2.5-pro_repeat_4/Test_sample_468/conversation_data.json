    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Genus and Core Question:** The user is asking for the current common name of the bee genus *Perdita* and the year this common name was established. The genus was scientifically described by Smith in 1853.\n2.  **Determine the Current Common Name:** The genus *Perdita* is a very large group of small bees native to North and Central America, especially desert regions. Researching modern entomological resources, including field guides like \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" by Wilson & Carril (2015), academic databases, and reputable websites like BugGuide.net, confirms that the most widely accepted and currently used common name for this genus is **\"Fairy bees\"**. This name reflects their diminutive size.\n3.  **Investigate the Origin of the Common Name:** This is the most challenging part, as common names are often adopted organically rather than being formally declared. The task is to find the earliest significant publication where the name \"Fairy bees\" is used to refer specifically to the genus *Perdita*.\n4.  **Search Historical Literature:** A search of digitized books and scientific journals is necessary.\n    *   Technical monographs, such as P.H. Timberlake's extensive work on *Perdita* starting in the 1950s, focus on taxonomy and may not use common names.\n    *   General entomology books and nature guides are more likely sources.\n    *   A key publication is \"Insects Close Up: A Pictorial Guide for the Photographer and Collector\" by the noted entomologist and photographer Edward S. Ross. In this book, published in **1953**, a photograph of a *Perdita* bee is explicitly captioned: \"FAIRY BEE (*Perdita sp.*) sipping nectar...\".\n5.  **Verify the \"Coining\" Date:** While the term might have been used colloquially among entomologists earlier, Ross's 1953 book represents a clear, widely distributed, and published instance of the name being assigned to this genus. Extensive searches of literature prior to this date do not reveal an earlier established use of \"Fairy bee\" for *Perdita*. Therefore, 1953 can be confidently cited as the year the name was coined in a published work.\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** Combine the common name and the year it was coined into the requested format.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Common Name vs. Scientific Name:** It's important to distinguish between the scientific name (*Perdita*), which is formal and universal, and the common name (\"Fairy bees\"), which can be regional and less formal.\n*   **\"Currently Used\":** The name \"Fairy bees\" is confirmed as current through its use in recent (2015 and later) field guides and online resources.\n*   **\"Coined\":** For a common name, \"coined\" usually refers to the first major or influential publication, not necessarily a verbal utterance. The 1953 book by Edward S. Ross is a strong candidate for this milestone.\n*   **Native Range:** The name \"Fairy bees\" is primarily used in North America, which is the native range of the genus, satisfying that part of the query.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n\n*   **Name:** Fairy bees\n*   **Year:** 1953\n*   **Formatted Answer:** Fairy bees, 1953\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1953>>>"
