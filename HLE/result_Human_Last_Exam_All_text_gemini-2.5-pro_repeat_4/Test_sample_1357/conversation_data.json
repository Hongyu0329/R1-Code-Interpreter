    "This problem asks for the number of combinatorial types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve $C$ under the condition that its Jacobian variety $J(C)$ has good reduction.\n\n### Step 1: Translate the condition on the Jacobian\n\nThe condition that the Jacobian $J(C)$ of a curve $C$ over a valuation field has good reduction imposes a strong restriction on the special fiber of the stable model of $C$. Let $\\mathcal{C}_k$ be the special fiber of the stable model. It is a stable curve of genus 4.\n\nA fundamental result by Raynaud states that $J(C)$ has good reduction if and only if the generalized Jacobian of the special fiber $\\mathcal{C}_k$ is an abelian variety. The generalized Jacobian $J(\\mathcal{C}_k)$ fits into an exact sequence:\n$0 \\to T \\to J(\\mathcal{C}_k) \\to A \\to 0$\nwhere $T$ is a torus and $A$ is an abelian variety. For $J(\\mathcal{C}_k)$ to be an abelian variety, the torus part $T$ must be trivial. The rank of the torus $T$ is equal to the first Betti number $b_1(\\Gamma)$ of the dual graph $\\Gamma$ of $\\mathcal{C}_k$.\n\nThe condition $T=\\{1\\}$ is equivalent to $b_1(\\Gamma)=0$. For a connected graph $\\Gamma$, $b_1(\\Gamma)=0$ if and only if $\\Gamma$ is a tree.\n\nSo, the problem is transformed into counting the number of combinatorial types of stable curves of genus 4 whose dual graph is a tree.\n\n### Step 2: The genus formula for a stable curve\n\nLet $\\mathcal{C}_k$ be a stable curve with $n$ irreducible components $C_1, \\dots, C_n$. Let $g'_i$ be the geometric genus of $C_i$ and $\\delta_{int,i}$ be the number of nodes on $C_i$ (self-intersections). The arithmetic genus of $C_i$ is $g_a(C_i) = g'_i + \\delta_{int,i}$.\nThe total arithmetic genus of $\\mathcal{C}_k$ is given by:\n$g(\\mathcal{C}_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g_a(C_i) + \\delta_{ext} - n + 1$\nwhere $\\delta_{ext}$ is the number of nodes connecting distinct components.\nWe are given $g(\\mathcal{C}_k) = 4$. Since the dual graph is a tree with $n$ vertices, it has $n-1$ edges. Thus, $\\delta_{ext} = n-1$.\nSubstituting this into the genus formula:\n$4 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (g'_i + \\delta_{int,i}) + (n-1) - n + 1$\n$4 = \\sum_{i=1}^n g'_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{int,i} = \\sum_{i=1}^n g'_i + \\delta_{int}$\nwhere $\\delta_{int} = \\sum \\delta_{int,i}$ is the total number of self-intersections.\n\n### Step 3: The stability condition\n\nA component $C_i$ which is a smooth rational curve (i.e., $g'_i=0$ and it has no self-intersections) is unstable if it meets the other components in fewer than three points. In our context, any rational component $C_i$ (i.e., $g'_i=0$) must have at least 3 nodes on it (including self-intersections and intersections with other components). Let $k_i$ be the total number of nodes on $C_i$. $k_i = \\delta_{int,i} + \\deg(v_i)$, where $\\deg(v_i)$ is the degree of the corresponding vertex in the dual graph. The stability condition is: if $g'_i=0$, then $k_i \\geq 3$.\n\n### Step 4: Systematically count the types by number of components $n$\n\nWe need to find all possible tree graphs, distributions of geometric genera $g'_i \\ge 0$ and self-intersections $\\delta_{int,i} \\ge 0$ that satisfy $\\sum g'_i + \\sum \\delta_{int,i} = 4$ and the stability condition.\n\n*   **n=1 (Irreducible curve):** The dual graph is a point (a tree).\n    $\\delta_{ext}=0$. The formula is $g'_1 + \\delta_{int,1} = 4$.\n    We can have the following partitions for $(g'_1, \\delta_{int,1})$:\n    (4,0), (3,1), (2,2), (1,3), (0,4). A rational curve ($g'_1=0$) with 4 nodes is stable.\n    This gives **5 types**.\n\n*   **n=2:** The dual graph is a line with 2 vertices (a tree), connected by one node.\n    $\\sum g'_i + \\delta_{int} = 4$. For $i=1,2$, if $g'_i=0$, we need $k_i = \\delta_{int,i} + 1 \\geq 3 \\implies \\delta_{int,i} \\geq 2$.\n    By systematically checking all partitions of 4 for $(g'_1, g'_2, \\delta_{int,1}, \\delta_{int,2})$ and applying the stability condition, we find **10 types**.\n\n*   **n=3:** The dual graph is a tree with 3 vertices. There are two such trees: a line (path graph $P_3$) and a star (claw graph $K_{1,2}$).\n    - **Line graph ($C_1-C_2-C_3$):** Degrees are (1,2,1). Stability requires: if $g'_1=0 \\implies \\delta_{int,1} \\geq 2$; if $g'_2=0 \\implies \\delta_{int,2} \\geq 1$; if $g'_3=0 \\implies \\delta_{int,3} \\geq 2$. Careful enumeration yields **9 types**.\n    - **Star graph ($C_c$ central, $C_{l1}, C_{l2}$ leaves):** Degrees are (2,1,1). Stability requires: if $g'_c=0 \\implies \\delta_{int,c} \\geq 1$; if $g'_{li}=0 \\implies \\delta_{int,li} \\geq 2$. Careful enumeration yields **9 types**.\n    Total for n=3 is $9+9=$ **18 types**.\n\n*   **n=4:** Dual graph is a tree with 4 vertices. There are two such trees: a line ($P_4$) and a star ($K_{1,3}$).\n    - **Line graph ($P_4$):** Degrees (1,2,2,1). Stability is restrictive. Only one configuration works: four genus 1 curves connected in a line with no self-intersections. This is **1 type**.\n    - **Star graph ($K_{1,3}$):** One central vertex (degree 3), three leaves (degree 1). Stability conditions are less restrictive for the central component. Enumeration yields **4 types**.\n    Total for n=4 is $1+4=$ **5 types**.\n\n*   **n=5:** Dual graph is a tree with 5 vertices. There are three such trees.\n    We need to find configurations satisfying $\\sum g'_i + \\delta_{int} = 4$ and stability.\n    - Partition $(g'_1,...,g'_5)=(1,1,1,1,0), \\delta_{int}=0$. The rational component must be on a vertex of degree $\\ge 3$. Trees with such vertices exist (star graph and \"fork\" graph). This gives **2 types**.\n    - Partition $(1,1,1,0,0), \\delta_{int}=1$. This requires a tree with vertices $v_4, v_5$ such that $\\deg(v_4) \\ge 2, \\deg(v_5) \\ge 3$. The fork graph works. This gives **1 type**.\n    Other partitions with more rational components or more nodes are impossible.\n    Total for n=5 is **3 types**.\n\n*   **n=6:** Dual graph is a tree with 6 vertices.\n    $\\sum g'_i + \\delta_{int} = 4$. The only possible partition with non-zero geometric genera for all components would have $\\sum g'_i \\ge 6$. Thus, there must be rational components.\n    The only possibility is the partition $(g'_1,...,g'_6)=(1,1,1,1,1,1)$ which gives sum of genera 6, too high.\n    We check partitions like $(1,1,1,1,0,0)$ with $\\delta_{int}=0$. This requires a tree on 6 vertices with two vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. Such a tree exists (the \"dumbbell\" graph). This gives **1 type**. All other possibilities fail the stability conditions.\n    Total for n=6 is **1 type**.\n\n*   **n=7:** Dual graph is a tree with 7 vertices.\n    $\\sum g'_i + \\delta_{int}=4$. Any configuration requires multiple rational components. For instance, $(1,1,1,1,0,0,0)$ with $\\delta_{int}=0$ requires a tree on 7 vertices with three vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. An analysis of the degree sum of a tree ($2(n-1)$) shows that no such tree exists. All other possibilities also fail.\n    Total for n=7 is **0 types**.\n\n*   **n > 7:** Similarly, no such stable curves exist.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSumming the number of types for each possible number of components:\n- n=1: 5 types\n- n=2: 10 types\n- n=3: 18 types\n- n=4: 5 types\n- n=5: 3 types\n- n=6: 1 type\n- n>=7: 0 types\n\nTotal number of types = $5 + 10 + 18 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 42$.\n\n<<<42>>>"
