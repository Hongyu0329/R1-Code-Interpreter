    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type:**\n    The reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a linear conjugated polyene. The formation of *cis* and *trans* isomer products (A and B) from this open-chain tetraene suggests an electrocyclic ring-closure reaction. The conjugated system involved is an octatetraene (from C2 to C9), which has 8 π-electrons. The substituents on the terminal carbons of the conjugated system (C2 and C9) are methyl groups. The reaction is an 8π electrocyclization to form *cis*- and *trans*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene.\n\n2.  **Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory / Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:**\n    *   **System:** The reacting system has 8 π-electrons. This is a system with 4n π-electrons, where n=2.\n    *   **Condition:** The reaction occurs under thermal conditions.\n    *   **FMO Analysis:** For a thermal reaction, the stereochemistry is governed by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO). For an 8π system (octatetraene), the HOMO is ψ₄.\n    *   **Symmetry of HOMO:** The molecular orbital ψ₄ of a linear polyene has terminal lobes with opposite signs (+ at one end, - at the other).\n    *   **Mode of Ring Closure:** To form a σ-bond, the orbitals must rotate to allow lobes of the same sign to overlap. Since the terminal lobes of the HOMO have opposite signs, the ring closure must proceed via a **conrotatory** motion (both ends rotate in the same direction, either both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n\n3.  **Analyze Reactant Conformations and Stereochemical Outcomes:**\n    The stereochemical outcome of the conrotatory closure depends on the ground-state conformation of the reactant. An open-chain polyene can adopt multiple conformations. For an 8π electrocyclization to occur, the molecule must adopt a shape that brings the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) close to each other. There are two major families of such conformations for this specific substrate:\n\n    *   **Conformer H (Helical):** This is a helical conformation where all the single bonds in the conjugated system (C3-C4, C5-C6, C7-C8) adopt an *s-cis* like arrangement. For the given \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) stereochemistry, this conformation places the terminal methyl groups in an \"out, in\" relationship (one methyl group points away from the helix axis, and the other points towards it).\n        *   **Outcome from H:** Applying the **conrotatory** motion to the (Me_out, Me_in) arrangement results in the two methyl groups ending up on opposite faces of the newly formed ring. This produces the **trans-isomer B**.\n\n    *   **Conformer T (Twisted):** This is a non-helical, more open, twisted conformation. While generally higher in energy than the helical conformer H, it also brings C2 and C9 into proximity. For the given \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) stereochemistry, this conformation can place both terminal methyl groups in an \"out, out\" relationship.\n        *   **Outcome from T:** Applying the **conrotatory** motion to the (Me_out, Me_out) arrangement results in the two methyl groups ending up on the same face of the newly formed ring. This produces the **cis-isomer A**.\n\n4.  **Predict the Ratio of Products using Transition State Analysis (Curtin-Hammett Principle):**\n    The two conformers, H and T, are in equilibrium. The reaction proceeds from both conformers through their respective transition states, TS(H) and TS(T).\n    *   `H ⇌ Reactant ⇌ T`\n    *   `H → TS(H) → trans-product (B)`\n    *   `T → TS(T) → cis-product (A)`\n    The ratio of products A/B is determined by the difference in the free energies of the two transition states (ΔΔG‡ = ΔG‡(A) - ΔG‡(B)), not the stabilities of the ground-state conformers. This is the Curtin-Hammett principle.\n\n    *   **FMO and Steric Analysis of Transition States:**\n        *   **TS(B) from Conformer H:** The helical conformer H is compact. The conrotatory motion required for cyclization introduces significant torsional and steric strain into this already constrained structure.\n        *   **TS(A) from Conformer T:** The twisted conformer T is more open and flexible. It can accommodate the conrotatory twisting motion with less steric hindrance and strain compared to the helical transition state.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Energies:** Due to lower steric strain, the transition state for the formation of the *cis*-isomer A, TS(A), is lower in energy than the transition state for the formation of the *trans*-isomer B, TS(B).\n        `ΔG‡(A) < ΔG‡(B)`\n\n5.  **Acquire the Final Answer:**\n    Since the activation energy for the formation of the *cis*-isomer A is lower than that for the *trans*-isomer B, the reaction leading to A is faster. Therefore, the **cis-isomer A is the major product**, and the **trans-isomer B is the minor product**. The ratio of A to B is greater than 1.\n    This specific reaction is a well-studied example in computational organic chemistry (pioneered by K. N. Houk). The calculations show a strong preference for the *cis* product. The predicted and experimentally observed ratio of A:B is approximately **9:1**.\n\nThe ratio of A to B is therefore 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
