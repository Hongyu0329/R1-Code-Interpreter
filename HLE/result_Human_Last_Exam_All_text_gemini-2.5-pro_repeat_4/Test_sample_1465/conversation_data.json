    "This question requires analyzing five different coiled-coil protein sequences and determining their likely oligomeric state (i.e., the number of helices that assemble together: dimer=2, trimer=3, tetramer=4, etc.). The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acids at the core positions of the heptad repeat, designated as 'a' and 'd'.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Heptad Repeat Register**\n\nA coiled-coil is characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern, `(abcdefg)n`. The core positions 'a' and 'd' are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. We need to find the correct phasing of this repeat for the given sequences. All sequences are 28 residues long, which corresponds to exactly four heptad repeats.\n\nLet's analyze the first sequence: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`.\nWe look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues that would fit the `a..d..` spacing.\nIf we assign the second residue ('I') as position 'a', then the fifth residue ('A') becomes position 'd'.\nThe register is `g(abcdefg)`.\nLet's check this phasing:\n-   **'a' positions:** 2, 9, 16, 23.\n-   **'d' positions:** 5, 12, 19, 26.\n\nApplying this to the first sequence:\n-   'a' residues are I, I, I, I. All are hydrophobic.\n-   'd' residues are A, A, A, A. All are hydrophobic.\nThis phasing is consistent and highly likely to be correct. We will use this register for all sequences.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each sequence based on its 'a' and 'd' residues**\n\nWe will use well-established rules from protein design studies (e.g., by Harbury, Alber, Kim, Woolfson) that link core residue identity to oligomeric state.\n\n1.  **Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n    *   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I (all Isoleucine)\n    *   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** A, A, A, A (all Alanine)\n    *   **Analysis:** The core composition is `a=I, d=A`. According to Harbury's rules, this combination of a beta-branched residue (I) at 'a' and a small residue (A) at 'd' strongly favors a **trimeric (3)** state.\n\n2.  **Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n    *   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, N, I (Isoleucine with one Asparagine)\n    *   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** L, L, L, L (all Leucine)\n    *   **Analysis:** The background pattern is `a=I, d=L`, which is a classic tetramer-forming motif. However, the single substitution of a polar Asparagine (N) at an 'a' position is a dominant feature. Asparagine at 'a' positions forms specific inter-helical hydrogen bonds that strongly favor and specify a parallel **dimeric (2)** structure.\n\n3.  **Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n    *   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I (all Isoleucine)\n    *   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** I, I, I, I (all Isoleucine)\n    *   **Analysis:** The core composition is `a=I, d=I`. Packing two layers of bulky, beta-branched Isoleucine residues is sterically optimal in a **trimeric (3)** arrangement.\n\n4.  **Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n    *   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I (all Isoleucine)\n    *   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** Q, Q, Q, Q (all Glutamine)\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a \"polar zipper\" with the polar residue Glutamine (Q) at all 'd' positions. While some Gln-containing cores can form tetramers, the outcome is context-dependent. Given the strong trimer-forming tendency of the `a=I` background (as seen in sequences 1 and 3), it is most likely that the Gln residues are accommodated within a **trimeric (3)** core rather than driving the formation of a higher-order oligomer.\n\n5.  **Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n    *   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I (all Isoleucine)\n    *   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** T, T, T, T (all Threonine)\n    *   **Analysis:** Here, the core contains Isoleucine at 'a' and another polar, beta-branched residue, Threonine (T), at 'd'. The combination of beta-branched residues at both 'a' and 'd' positions can create steric strain. A trimer might be too crowded. A pentamer (as seen in some Thr-zippers) is a possibility, but might be disfavored by the bulky `a=I` layer. A **tetrameric (4)** state offers a stable intermediate that can accommodate the steric bulk and allow favorable polar interactions of the Threonine hydroxyl groups in the core.\n\n**Summary of Oligomeric States:**\n\n*   Sequence 1: **3** (Trimer)\n*   Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 3: **3** (Trimer)\n*   Sequence 4: **3** (Trimer)\n*   Sequence 5: **4** (Tetramer)\n\nThe resulting sequence of oligomeric states is **3, 2, 3, 3, 4**. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
