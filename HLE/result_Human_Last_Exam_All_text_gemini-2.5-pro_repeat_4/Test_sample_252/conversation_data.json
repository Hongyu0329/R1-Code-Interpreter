    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n\n*   **\"Full spectral volume\":** This refers to a three-dimensional data cube, often denoted as `I(x, y, λ)`. It contains spatial information on two axes (x, y) and spectral information (wavelength, λ) on the third axis. This is also known as a hyperspectral image.\n*   **\"From a single image\":** This specifies a \"snapshot\" technique, where all the information required for the reconstruction is captured simultaneously in one exposure on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor).\n*   **\"Using computed tomography\":** This names the specific reconstruction method. Computed Tomography (CT) is a mathematical process used to reconstruct a volumetric object from its projections taken at different angles. The key idea is that multiple views are required for a successful reconstruction.\n*   **\"Minimum number of diffraction gratings\":** This is the core of the question. A diffraction grating is an optical element that splits and disperses light into its constituent wavelengths. We need to find the minimum number of these needed for the process to work.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the physical process (Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry - CTIS)**\n\nThe technique described is known as CTIS. Here's how it works:\n1.  Light from a scene is collected by an objective lens.\n2.  Before reaching the detector, the light passes through a special disperser, which is a diffraction grating.\n3.  This grating produces multiple copies of the image of the scene on the 2D detector. The central copy (the 0th diffraction order) is an undispersed, panchromatic (grayscale) image.\n4.  The other copies (±1st, ±2nd, etc., diffraction orders) are spectrally dispersed. The light from each point in the scene is spread out into a line of colors (a spectrum).\n5.  Each of these dispersed images can be mathematically treated as a 2D projection of the 3D `(x, y, λ)` data cube.\n6.  A computed tomography algorithm then takes these multiple projections from the single detector image and uses them to reconstruct the original 3D data cube.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the role of projections in Computed Tomography**\n\nA fundamental principle of CT is that for a good reconstruction of a 3D object, you need projections from many different angles. If you only have projections from one direction (or along one axis), the reconstruction problem is ill-posed. This results in severe artifacts and a loss of information, often called the \"missing cone problem\" in the Fourier domain. It would be impossible to construct a \"full\" volume.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the minimum number of gratings based on CT principles**\n\n*   **Case 1: One 1D diffraction grating.** A standard diffraction grating has a periodic structure in one dimension (like parallel lines). It disperses light along a single axis, perpendicular to the lines of the grating. While it produces multiple diffraction orders (projections), they are all dispersed along the same line. This is analogous to a medical CT scanner only taking pictures from the front and back, but not the sides. This set of projections is insufficient to fill the 3D Fourier space required for reconstruction, leading to the \"missing cone problem\". Therefore, a single 1D grating is not sufficient to construct a \"full spectral volume\".\n\n*   **Case 2: Two 1D diffraction gratings.** To solve the missing cone problem, we need projections along at least one other direction. This can be achieved by adding a second 1D grating, oriented orthogonally to the first (i.e., \"crossed gratings\"). This system provides two independent axes of dispersion. The resulting diffraction pattern on the detector is a 2D grid of spectrally dispersed images. We get horizontally dispersed images, vertically dispersed images, and diagonally dispersed images (from the combined effect of both gratings). This rich set of projections from different angles allows the computed tomography algorithm to successfully reconstruct the 3D data cube.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Physical vs. Functional:** The two crossed 1D gratings can be manufactured as a single physical component, typically called a 2D grating or a Computer-Generated Hologram (CGH). However, the question asks for the \"minimum number... necessary\". The necessity arises from the physical principle of tomography, which requires at least two independent dispersion axes to work correctly. A single 1D grating provides only one axis and is insufficient. The function of two gratings is the minimum requirement.\n*   **\"Full spectral volume\":** This wording implies a high-fidelity reconstruction, which is not possible with the limited information from a single 1D grating.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since one grating (in the sense of a 1D grating providing one dispersion axis) is insufficient, and two gratings (providing two independent dispersion axes) are sufficient, the minimum number necessary for the principle to work is two.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\n1.  The problem describes Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n2.  CTIS relies on the principles of computed tomography, which requires projections from multiple, distinct angles for reconstruction.\n3.  A single 1D diffraction grating provides projections along only one axis, which is insufficient for a full reconstruction (causes the \"missing cone problem\").\n4.  To get projections from different angles, a second, non-collinear dispersion axis is needed. This is provided by a second grating.\n5.  Therefore, the functional equivalent of two diffraction gratings is the minimum requirement to construct a full spectral volume using this method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
