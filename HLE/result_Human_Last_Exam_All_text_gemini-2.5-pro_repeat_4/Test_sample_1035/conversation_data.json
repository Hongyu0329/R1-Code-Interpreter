    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) for n = 35.\n\n*   **Complete Graph \\( K_n \\):** A graph with \\( n \\) vertices, where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Let its vertex set be \\( V_n \\). For this problem, \\( n = 35 \\).\n*   **Family of Bipartite Graphs:** A set of graphs, \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k\\} \\), where each \\( G_i \\) is a bipartite graph.\n*   **Covering all the edges of \\( K_n \\):** This means that for every edge \\( e \\) in \\( K_n \\), there is at least one graph \\( G_i \\) in the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) that contains the edge \\( e \\). Mathematically, \\( E(K_n) \\subseteq \\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(G_i) \\).\n*   **Number of vertices in a family:** This phrase is the most critical part to interpret correctly. Let \\( V_i = V(G_i) \\) be the vertex set of the graph \\( G_i \\). The \"family of graphs\" involves a collection of vertex sets. The total set of vertices used in the construction is the union of all these vertex sets, \\( V_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k V_i \\). The question is asking for the minimum possible size of this union, i.e., \\( \\min |V_{\\mathcal{F}}| \\).\n\n**2. Establish a Lower Bound**\n\nLet's find the absolute minimum number of vertices required.\n\n*   Let \\( V_n = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\} \\) be the set of vertices of \\( K_{35} \\).\n*   Consider any vertex \\( u \\in V_n \\). Since \\( n=35 \\ge 2 \\), \\( u \\) is an endpoint of at least one edge in \\( K_{35} \\), for example the edge \\( (u, v) \\) for some \\( v \\in V_n, v \\neq u \\).\n*   By the covering condition, this edge \\( (u, v) \\) must be present in at least one of the bipartite graphs in the family, say \\( G_i \\).\n*   For the edge \\( (u, v) \\) to be in \\( G_i \\), its endpoints \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) must be vertices of \\( G_i \\). This means \\( u \\in V(G_i) \\) and \\( v \\in V(G_i) \\).\n*   Therefore, \\( u \\) must be in the total vertex set of the family, \\( V_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\bigcup_{j=1}^k V(G_j) \\).\n*   Since this holds for any vertex \\( u \\in V_n \\), the entire vertex set of \\( K_n \\) must be a subset of the family's vertex set: \\( V_n \\subseteq V_{\\mathcal{F}} \\).\n*   This implies that the number of vertices in the family must be at least the number of vertices in \\( K_n \\). So, \\( |V_{\\mathcal{F}}| \\ge |V_n| = n \\).\n*   For \\( n=35 \\), we have \\( |V_{\\mathcal{F}}| \\ge 35 \\).\n\n**3. Show the Lower Bound is Achievable**\n\nNow, we need to show that it is possible to construct a family of bipartite graphs that covers \\( K_n \\) and uses exactly \\( n \\) vertices. This will prove that the minimum is \\( n \\).\n\n*   To achieve a total of \\( n \\) vertices, we can restrict all our bipartite graphs to use only the vertices from \\( K_n \\). That is, for every graph \\( G_i \\) in our family, \\( V(G_i) \\subseteq V_n \\). In this case, their union \\( V_{\\mathcal{F}} \\) will also be a subset of \\( V_n \\). Combined with the lower bound \\( V_n \\subseteq V_{\\mathcal{F}} \\), this means \\( V_{\\mathcal{F}} = V_n \\), and \\( |V_{\\mathcal{F}}| = n \\).\n*   We use a standard construction based on binary representations of vertex labels. This construction also shows the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed, a result known as the biclique covering number of \\( K_n \\), which is \\( \\text{bc}(K_n) = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n*   For \\( n=35 \\), the number of bipartite graphs needed is \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\). Since \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\), we have \\( 5 < \\log_2 35 < 6 \\), so \\( k = 6 \\).\n*   Let the vertex set be \\( V_{35} = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\} \\).\n*   Assign a unique 6-bit binary vector (a label) to each of the 35 vertices. This is possible because there are \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) unique 6-bit vectors available. For example, we can assign the binary representation of integers 0 to 34.\n*   We construct a family of \\( k=6 \\) bipartite graphs, \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4, G_5, G_6\\} \\).\n*   For each graph \\( G_j \\) (where \\( j \\) from 1 to 6), the vertex set is \\( V(G_j) = V_{35} \\).\n*   The graph \\( G_j \\) is defined by a partition of its vertices into two sets, \\( A_j \\) and \\( B_j \\), based on the \\( j \\)-th bit of their binary labels:\n    *   \\( A_j = \\{v \\in V_{35} \\mid \\text{the j-th bit of v's label is 0}\\} \\)\n    *   \\( B_j = \\{v \\in V_{35} \\mid \\text{the j-th bit of v's label is 1}\\} \\)\n*   The edges of \\( G_j \\) are all possible edges between a vertex in \\( A_j \\) and a vertex in \\( B_j \\). (This makes \\( G_j \\) a complete bipartite graph, also known as a biclique).\n*   Now, we must verify that this family covers all edges of \\( K_{35} \\). Consider any two distinct vertices, say \\( u \\) and \\( w \\), from \\( V_{35} \\). The edge is \\( (u, w) \\). Since \\( u \\) and \\( w \\) are distinct, their assigned binary labels must be different. This means their 6-bit labels must differ in at least one bit position. Let's say they differ at the \\( j \\)-th position.\n*   If they differ at the \\( j \\)-th position, one must have a 0 and the other a 1 at that position. By our construction of \\( G_j \\), this means one of the vertices is in \\( A_j \\) and the other is in \\( B_j \\).\n*   Therefore, the edge \\( (u, w) \\) is included in the graph \\( G_j \\).\n*   Since this holds for any pair of vertices, every edge of \\( K_{35} \\) is covered by at least one of the graphs in our family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\).\n*   The total set of vertices used in this construction is \\( V_{\\mathcal{F}} = \\bigcup_{j=1}^6 V(G_j) = \\bigcup_{j=1}^6 V_{35} = V_{35} \\).\n*   The total number of vertices is \\( |V_{\\mathcal{F}}| = |V_{35}| = 35 \\).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that at least 35 vertices are required, and we have constructed a valid covering that uses exactly 35 vertices. Therefore, the minimum number of vertices is 35.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimum number of vertices required is n. Let the family of bipartite graphs be \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, \\dots, G_k\\} \\) and let the vertex set of \\( K_n \\) be \\( V_n \\). The total set of vertices used by the family is \\( V_\\mathcal{F} = \\bigcup_i V(G_i) \\). For any edge \\( (u,v) \\in E(K_n) \\) to be covered by some \\( G_i \\), both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) must belong to \\( V(G_i) \\), and thus to \\( V_\\mathcal{F} \\). This implies \\( V_n \\subseteq V_\\mathcal{F} \\), so \\( |V_\\mathcal{F}| \\ge n \\). This lower bound of \\( n \\) is achievable by constructing a family of bipartite graphs whose vertex sets are all \\( V_n \\). A well-known construction uses \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) complete bipartite graphs on the vertex set \\( V_n \\) to cover all edges of \\( K_n \\). For \\( n=35 \\), this construction is valid and uses exactly 35 vertices. Thus, the minimum number of vertices is 35.\n\n<<<35>>>"
