    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Principles of Coiled-Coil Structure**\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices are coiled together like a rope. Their formation is driven by the packing of hydrophobic amino acid side chains into a core shielded from water. The primary sequence of a coiled-coil typically features a repeating seven-residue pattern, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Positions 'a' and 'd'**: These are the core positions. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues (like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), Alanine (A)). The side chains of these residues pack against each other in what is called a \"knobs-into-holes\" arrangement. The identity and size of the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n*   **Positions 'e' and 'g'**: These are often charged or polar residues located on the edge of the hydrophobic core. They can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between adjacent helices.\n*   **Positions 'b', 'c', and 'f'**: These are typically polar, solvent-exposed residues.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\nThe sequence is 30 amino acids long. Coiled-coils are often flanked by non-helical capping residues. The two Glycine (G) residues at the beginning and end are likely such caps. This leaves a core sequence of 28 residues, which corresponds perfectly to four heptad repeats (4 x 7 = 28).\n\nCore sequence: `EIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLK`\n\nWe need to find the correct `(abcdefg)` register. We do this by looking for a consistent pattern of hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions. Let's test the possible registers (or \"phases\"). A successful register will place hydrophobic residues consistently at positions 'a' and 'd'.\n\nLet's try a register where position 'a' is Alanine (A) and position 'd' is Leucine (L). This means 'a' and 'd' are separated by two residues (`a-x-x-d`). Let's scan the sequence for this pattern.\nThe first `A` is at position 4 of the full sequence, and the first `L` is at position 7. This fits the `a-x-x-d` pattern. Let's see if this register holds for the entire sequence.\n\nIf this register is correct, the 'a' and 'd' positions will repeat every 7 residues.\n*   **'a' positions**: 4, (4+7=)11, (11+7=)18, (18+7=)25\n*   **'d' positions**: 7, (7+7=)14, (14+7=)21, (21+7=)28\n\nNow, let's check the amino acids at these positions in the sequence:\n`G(1)E(2)I(3)**A(4)**Q(5)S(6)**L(7)**K(8)E(9)I(10)**A(11)**K(12)S(13)**L(14)**K(15)E(16)I(17)**A(18)**W(19)S(20)**L(21)**K(22)E(23)I(24)**A(25)**Q(26)S(27)**L(28)**K(29)G(30)`\n\n*   Residues at 'a' positions: A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25). This is a consistent pattern of **Alanine (A)**.\n*   Residues at 'd' positions: L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28). This is a consistent pattern of **Leucine (L)**.\n\nThis register is highly plausible because it creates a consistent hydrophobic core with Alanine at all 'a' positions and Leucine at all 'd' positions.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Core Packing to Oligomeric State**\nThe specific combination of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions dictates the preferred oligomeric state by optimizing packing efficiency.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices)**: Typically requires large hydrophobic residues at both 'a' and 'd' positions (e.g., L, I) to fill the core effectively. If 'a' were Alanine, a significant cavity or \"hole\" would be left in the core, making the dimer less stable.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices)**: The helices are packed more tightly with a more acute crossing angle than in dimers. This geometry is perfectly suited for a core where the 'a' position is occupied by a small residue (like **Alanine**) and the 'd' position is occupied by a large residue (like **Leucine**). The small 'a' residues pack neatly together in the center of the bundle without steric clash, while the large 'd' residues fill the remaining space. This `a=A, d=L` pattern is a classic design feature of trimeric coiled-coils.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices)**: Often formed by patterns opposite to the trimer-promoting one, such as having a large residue at 'a' (I or L) and a small one at 'd' (A or V). A core with `a=A, d=L` would likely be \"over-packed\" and sterically unfavorable for a tetramer, as the four large Leucine residues at the 'd' layer would clash.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe sequence has a clear heptad repeat with Alanine (A) consistently at the 'a' positions and Leucine (L) consistently at the 'd' positions. Based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing, this specific arrangement of a small hydrophobic residue at 'a' and a large hydrophobic residue at 'd' provides the most efficient and stable packing for a **trimeric** coiled-coil.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein would be 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
