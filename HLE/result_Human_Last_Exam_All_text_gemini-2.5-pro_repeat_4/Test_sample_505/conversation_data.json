    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Surface Codes\n\nA surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. It is defined on a two-dimensional lattice of physical qubits. Logical qubits are encoded in the non-local, topological properties of this lattice. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. For a standard planar code (a single rectangular patch), the topology is that of a disk.\n\n### Step 2: How Holes Encode Logical Qubits in a Planar Code\n\nA simple, hole-less patch of a planar surface code does not encode any logical qubits. To encode logical qubits, we introduce defects, which are often referred to as \"holes\" or \"punctures\".\n\n*   **A single patch (or a disk):** This has one outer boundary. The number of logical qubits `k` in a single connected surface is given by the formula `k = b - 1`, where `b` is the number of boundaries.\n*   **Without holes:** A single patch has only one boundary (the outer one). So, `b=1`, and `k = 1 - 1 = 0` logical qubits.\n*   **With holes:** Each hole we create inside the patch adds a new, inner boundary. If we create `h` holes in a single patch, the total number of boundaries becomes `b = 1 (outer) + h (inner)`.\n*   **Formula for a single patch:** The number of logical qubits `k` in a single patch with `h` holes is `k = b - 1 = (1 + h) - 1 = h`.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** This is a crucial takeaway. For a single patch of planar surface code, the number of logical qubits it can store is exactly equal to the number of holes created within it.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Systems with Multiple Patches\n\nThe question specifies \"two patches of surface code\". These patches are distinct and separate from each other.\n\n*   When you have multiple, disconnected patches of a code, the total number of logical qubits in the system is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch. This is because the logical operators of one patch are physically separated from the operators of another, and they will naturally commute.\n*   **Formula for multiple patches:** If we have `N` patches, and the `i`-th patch has `k_i` logical qubits, the total number of logical qubits is `k_total = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_N`.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The \"at most\" part of the question prompts us to consider how to distribute the resources (in this case, the holes) among the patches to maximize the total number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Principles to the Specific Problem\n\nLet's apply the rules from the previous steps to the given scenario:\n*   Number of patches = 2.\n*   Total number of holes = 2.\n\nLet `h_1` be the number of holes in the first patch and `h_2` be the number of holes in the second patch.\nLet `k_1` and `k_2` be the number of logical qubits in the first and second patches, respectively.\n\nFrom Step 2, we know:\n*   `k_1 = h_1`\n*   `k_2 = h_2`\n\nFrom Step 3, the total number of logical qubits is:\n*   `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = h_1 + h_2`\n\nThe problem states that the total number of holes is two:\n*   `h_1 + h_2 = 2`\n\nTherefore, the total number of logical qubits is:\n*   `k_total = 2`\n\n### Step 5: Verify the \"Maximum\" Condition\n\nWe need to check if the distribution of holes affects the total number of logical qubits. Since `h_1` and `h_2` must be non-negative integers, we can have the following distributions of the two holes:\n\n*   **Case A:** Both holes are in the first patch.\n    *   `h_1 = 2`, `h_2 = 0`\n    *   `k_1 = 2`, `k_2 = 0`\n    *   `k_total = 2 + 0 = 2`\n\n*   **Case B:** One hole is in each patch.\n    *   `h_1 = 1`, `h_2 = 1`\n    *   `k_1 = 1`, `k_2 = 1`\n    *   `k_total = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Case C:** Both holes are in the second patch.\n    *   `h_1 = 0`, `h_2 = 2`\n    *   `k_1 = 0`, `k_2 = 2`\n    *   `k_total = 0 + 2 = 2`\n\n**Careful Point 3:** In every possible configuration, the total number of logical qubits is exactly 2. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 2. The way the holes are distributed between the two patches does not change the total qubit count.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe number of logical qubits in a system of disconnected planar surface codes is equal to the total number of holes across all patches. Given two patches and a total of two holes, the total number of logical qubits is 2, regardless of how the holes are distributed between the patches.\n\n<<<2>>>"
