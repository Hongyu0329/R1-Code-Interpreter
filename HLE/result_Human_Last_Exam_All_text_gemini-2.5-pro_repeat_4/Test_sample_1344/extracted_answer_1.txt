The optimal combination is a **Zirconium (Zr)** metal center coordinated to a **Constrained Geometry Catalyst (CGC) ligand** (specifically, a silyl-bridged cyclopentadienyl-amido type ligand). This active complex should be supported on **silica (SiOâ‚‚) that has been pre-treated with methylaluminoxane (MAO)**, which serves as both the activator and a tether to the support.
