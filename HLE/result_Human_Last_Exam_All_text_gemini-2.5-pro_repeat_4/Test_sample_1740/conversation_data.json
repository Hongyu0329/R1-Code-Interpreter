    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe core of the question is to determine the total count of distinct members belonging to the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs that have been identified specifically in \"humans\" up \"to date\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify Careful Points and Potential Ambiguities**\n1.  **Definition of a \"Member\":** In the context of microRNA families, a \"member\" can be interpreted in two main ways:\n    *   **Distinct Mature miRNA:** This refers to the unique, functional mature miRNA sequences (e.g., let-7a, let-7b). This is the most common interpretation.\n    *   **Distinct Genes:** This refers to the individual genes in the genome that encode for these miRNAs. Sometimes, a single mature miRNA can be encoded by multiple genes at different locations in the genome (paralogs). For example, let-7a is encoded by three separate genes.\n    The question's phrasing \"members of the...family\" typically refers to the functionally distinct mature miRNA types.\n\n2.  **Authoritative Source:** The number of identified miRNAs can change with new research. Therefore, it is crucial to rely on the most current and authoritative source, which for microRNAs is the **miRBase database**. This database is the central, public repository for all published microRNA sequences and annotation.\n\n3.  **Species Specificity:** The let-7 family is highly conserved across many species, but the exact number of members can vary. The question specifically asks for the count in **humans** (*Homo sapiens*). For instance, some members like let-7h are found in other primates but not in humans.\n\n4.  **Family Inclusion Criteria:** The let-7 family includes microRNAs that share a highly similar \"seed sequence\" (nucleotides 2-8 of the mature miRNA), which determines their target genes. One member, **miR-98**, does not have \"let-7\" in its name but is considered a canonical member of the family due to its sequence and functional similarity.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Answer by Listing and Counting\n\nBased on the latest data from miRBase and established scientific consensus, we can list the distinct members of the let-7 family found in humans:\n\n1.  **let-7a**\n2.  **let-7b**\n3.  **let-7c**\n4.  **let-7d**\n5.  **let-7e**\n6.  **let-7f**\n7.  **let-7g**\n8.  **let-7i** (Note: there is no let-7h in humans)\n9.  **miR-98** (Structurally and functionally part of the let-7 family)\n\nCounting these distinct members gives a total of **9**.\n\n*Further Detail (Addressing the Gene Count):*\nWhile there are 9 distinct mature miRNA members, they are encoded by a total of 12 different genes in the human genome.\n*   **let-7a:** 3 genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, let-7a-3)\n*   **let-7f:** 2 genes (let-7f-1, let-7f-2)\n*   **let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98:** 1 gene each\nThis sums to 3 + 2 + 7 = 12 genes. However, the standard answer to \"how many members\" is the count of the distinct mature types, which is 9.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis confirms that by counting the distinct mature microRNA types, which is the standard convention for defining family \"members\", there are 9 identified members in the human let-7 family.\n\n<<<9>>>"
