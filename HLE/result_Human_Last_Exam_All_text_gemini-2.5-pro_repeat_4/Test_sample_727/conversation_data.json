    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chess position to determine the correct drawing move for Black.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Position and the Critical Moment**\nThe game has reached move 130. It is Black's turn to move. The position on the board is:\n*   **White:** King on h3, Rook on f5, Knight on h5, Pawn on e5.\n*   **Black:** King on e8, Queen on a2.\nThe move played in the actual game was 130...Qe6, which is stated to be a losing blunder. We need to find the alternative queen move that would have secured a draw for Black.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze White's Winning Plan**\nWhite's material advantage (Rook + Knight vs. Queen) is normally not enough to win, but the advanced pawn on e5 is a major threat. White's primary winning idea is to bring the king to a safer and more active square to support the pawn's advance. The key move White wants to play is `131. Kh4`.\n*   After `131. Kh4`, the White king is safer from checks on the h-file.\n*   The king on h4 supports the knight on h5.\n*   From h4, the king can later move to g5 to further support the pawn.\n*   With the king safe, White can push the pawn with `e6`, which severely restricts the Black king, and then use the rook and knight to deliver a decisive attack or force the pawn's promotion.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Why the Actual Move (130...Qe6) Lost**\nBlack played `130...Qe6?`. This move failed because it allowed White to execute the winning plan described above.\n*   The game continued: `131. Kh4!`. Now the White king is safe and active.\n*   Black has no good way to stop White's follow-up. The game continued `131...Qh6+ 132. Nh5 Qh7 133. e6!`.\n*   This sequence led to a completely winning position for White, as the Black king was trapped and White's pieces coordinated perfectly to win the game.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Alternative Queen Moves**\nThe main criterion for a good move for Black is whether it prevents White from playing `131. Kh4`. If a move allows `131. Kh4`, it is likely losing for the same reason `130...Qe6` was.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\n*   **Checks that allow the king to escape:**\n    *   `Qe2+`, `Qc2+`, `Qb2+`, `Qd2+`, `Qa1+`: All these checks are met by `131. Kh4`. The White king simply moves to h4, and Black is facing the same losing plan.\n    *   `Qh2+`: This check is met by `131. Kg4`. The king again escapes to an active square, and White will consolidate and win.\n\n*   **Quiet moves that don't stop the plan:**\n    *   `Qa3`, `Qa4`, `Qa5`, `Qa6`, `Qa7`, `Qa8`: None of these moves prevent White from playing the decisive `131. Kh4`. After `131. Kh4`, Black has no saving checks, and White proceeds with the winning plan (`e6`, etc.).\n\n*   **Moves that control the key square (g4):**\n    The only way to prevent `131. Kh4` is to control the g4 square. Two moves in the list do this: `Qf2` and `Qg2`. Let's compare them.\n    *   `D. Qf2`: This looks promising as it prevents `131. Kh4`. However, White has a subtle and strong reply: `131. Rf1!`. This move attacks the Black queen, forcing it to move. After Black plays `131...Qe2+` (the most natural response), White can now play `132. Kh4!`. The king has escaped, and Black is once again in a losing position.\n    *   **`C. Qg2`**: This is the correct move. It is the only move that effectively prevents the White king from moving to h4.\n        *   After `130...Qg2`, White cannot play `131. Kh4`.\n        *   White also cannot easily dislodge the queen from g2 (unlike the `Qf2` line where `Rf1` was possible).\n        *   If White tries to push the pawn with `131. e6`, Black's crucial defense is `131...Ke7!`. The Black king begins to escape towards the queenside (`...Kd6`, `...Kc6`). The White king is stuck on the h-file, where it remains a target for the Black queen. White cannot coordinate his pieces effectively to win, and the game will end in a draw by perpetual check or repetition of moves.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy preventing the White king from moving to h4, the move `130...Qg2` foils White's only winning plan. All other queen moves allow the king to escape, leading to a lost position for Black.\n\n<<<C>>>"
