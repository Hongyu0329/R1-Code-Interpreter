    "Answering this question requires understanding the relationship between the irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ and the partitions of $n$, and how to calculate the dimension of these irreps. For $n=25$, we are looking for the number of irreps with dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Irreps of $S_n$ and Partitions:** The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n\n2.  **Dimension of Irreps:** The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook-Length Formula. The formula is $d_\\lambda = n! / \\prod h_{ij}$, where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ of the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$.\n\n3.  **Key Property of Dimensions:** The dimension $d_\\lambda$ is generally smallest for partitions that are \"stretched out\" (i.e., have a very long first row or a very long first column) and largest for partitions that are \"central\" or \"square-like\". The partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ correspond to irreps of the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$.\n\n4.  **Systematic Search Strategy:** Instead of checking all 1958 partitions of 25, we can systematically search for partitions with small dimensions. We will search for partitions that are \"close to the edge\" of the partition lattice. These are partitions of the form $\\lambda = (n-k, \\pi)$, where $k$ is a small integer and $\\pi$ is a partition of $k$. These partitions have a large first row $\\lambda_1 = n-k$. By considering their conjugates, we also cover partitions with a large number of parts (i.e., a large first column).\n\n5.  **Enumeration:** We will check partitions based on the number of cells not in the first row, $k = 25 - \\lambda_1$. For each valid partition $\\lambda$, we check if $d_\\lambda < 500,000$. If it is, and $\\lambda$ is not self-conjugate ($\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$), we count two irreps (one for $\\lambda$ and one for $\\lambda'$). If it were self-conjugate, we would count one.\n\n*   **k=0:** $\\lambda=(25)$. $d_{(25)}=1$. Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, with $d_{(1^{25})}=1$. This pair gives **2** irreps.\n*   **k=1:** $\\lambda=(24,1)$. $d_{(24,1)}=n-1=24$. Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(2,1^{23})$. This pair gives **2** irreps.\n*   **k=2 (Partitions of 2):**\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)}=275$. This and its conjugate give **2** irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)}=276$. This and its conjugate give **2** irreps.\n*   **k=3 (Partitions of 3):**\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $d_{(22,3)}=2000$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)}=4025$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$: $d_{(22,1,1,1)}=2024$. (2 irreps)\n*   **k=4 (Partitions of 4):** All 5 partitions of 4 lead to valid irreps.\n    *   (21,4): $d=10350$; (21,3,1): $d=31350$; (21,2,2): $d=23750$; (21,2,1,1): $d=31625$; (21,1^4): $d=10626$.\n    *   This gives $5 \\times 2 = \\textbf{10}$ irreps.\n*   **k=5 (Partitions of 5):** All 7 partitions of 5 lead to valid irreps.\n    *   (20,5): $d=40480$; (20,4,1): $d=126500$; (20,3,2): $d=116280$; (20,3,1,1): $d=151800$; (20,2,2,1): $d=126500$; (20,2,1,1,1): $d=154440$; (20,1^5): $d=42504$.\n    *   This gives $7 \\times 2 = \\textbf{14}$ irreps.\n*   **k=6 (Partitions of 6):** We test partitions of 6.\n    *   (19,6): $d=123970$ (OK)\n    *   (19,5,1): $d=409925$ (OK)\n    *   (19,4,2): $d=453756$ (OK)\n    *   (19,3,3): $d=347425$ (OK)\n    *   (19,1^6): $d=134596$ (OK)\n    *   (19,4,1,1): $d=544506$ (> 500,000). Other partitions of 6 that are \"less stretched\" than (4,1,1) will also have dimensions greater than 500,000.\n    *   This gives $5 \\times 2 = \\textbf{10}$ irreps.\n*   **k=7 (Partitions of 7):**\n    *   (18,7): $d=303600$ (OK)\n    *   (18,1^7): $d=346104$ (OK)\n    *   (18,6,1): $d \\approx 1.14 \\times 10^6$ (> 500,000). All others will also be too large.\n    *   This gives $2 \\times 2 = \\textbf{4}$ irreps.\n*   **k=8 (Partitions of 8):**\n    *   (17,8): $d \\approx 6.0 \\times 10^5$ (> 500,000)\n    *   (17,1^8): $d \\approx 7.3 \\times 10^5$ (> 500,000)\n    *   No partitions for $k=8$ (or any $k>8$) will have dimensions less than 500,000.\n\n6.  **Final Count:** Summing up the number of irreps found:\n    *   k=0: 2\n    *   k=1: 2\n    *   k=2: 2 + 2 = 4\n    *   k=3: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n    *   k=4: 10\n    *   k=5: 14\n    *   k=6: 10\n    *   k=7: 4\n    *   None of the found partitions are self-conjugate, so each contributes 2 to the count.\n\n    Total number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 10 + 4 = 52$.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 52 irreducible representations of $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000."
