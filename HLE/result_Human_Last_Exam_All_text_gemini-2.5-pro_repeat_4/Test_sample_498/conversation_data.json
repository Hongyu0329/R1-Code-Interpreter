    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to determine the next letter.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation**\nThe given sequence is `ZXXCVYBN_`.\nAt first glance, most of these letters appear on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard. The bottom row of letters is `Z X C V B N M`. This suggests the pattern is related to the keyboard layout.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Pattern Structure**\nThe sequence does not simply follow the keyboard row. There are extra letters and letters that seem out of place (like `Y`). Let's test the hypothesis that the sequence is formed by interleaving two separate sequences.\nLet's call them Sequence A (containing letters at odd positions) and Sequence B (containing letters at even positions).\n\nOriginal Sequence: `Z X X C V Y B N _`\nSequence A: `Z, X, V, B, _`\nSequence B: `X, C, Y, N`\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing Sequence A**\nLet's analyze the letters in Sequence A: `Z, X, V, B`.\nNow, let's locate these on the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard:\n- `Z` is the 1st letter.\n- `X` is the 2nd letter.\n- `C` is the 3rd letter.\n- `V` is the 4th letter.\n- `B` is the 5th letter.\n- `N` is the 6th letter.\n- `M` is the 7th letter.\n\nSequence A consists of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th letters from this row. The pattern is as follows:\n- Take the first two letters: `Z, X`.\n- Skip the next letter: `C`.\n- Take the next two letters: `V, B`.\n- To continue the pattern, we would skip the next letter, which is `N`.\n- After skipping `N`, the next letter in the row is `M`.\n\nSo, the next letter in Sequence A should be `M`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing Sequence B**\nLet's look at Sequence B: `X, C, Y, N`. While these letters also have positions on the keyboard, their pattern is less obvious and appears to be the \"filler\" sequence that is interleaved with the more structured Sequence A. We may not need to decipher Sequence B's pattern to find the answer.\n\n**Step 5: Reconstructing the Main Sequence and Finding the Next Letter**\nLet's see if our analysis holds by reconstructing the original sequence.\n- Sequence A is `Z, X, V, B, M`.\n- Sequence B is `X, C, Y, N`.\n\nInterleaving them (A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3, A4, B4, A5...) gives:\n- `Z` (from A)\n- `X` (from B)\n- `X` (from A)\n- `C` (from B)\n- `V` (from A)\n- `Y` (from B)\n- `B` (from A)\n- `N` (from B)\n\nThis perfectly reconstructs the given sequence `ZXXCVYBN`. The next position in the interleaved sequence belongs to Sequence A. As determined in Step 3, the next letter in Sequence A is `M`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sequence is created by interleaving two sequences. The primary sequence follows a \"take two, skip one\" rule along the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard. The next letter in this primary sequence, and therefore the next letter in the overall sequence, is `M`.\n\n<<<M>>>"
