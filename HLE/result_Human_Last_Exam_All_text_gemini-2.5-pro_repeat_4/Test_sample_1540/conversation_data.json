    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient C solution and calculate the memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The primary task is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring the case of the letters. The strings are guaranteed to have the same length. The secondary task is to devise the most memory-efficient C program for this and calculate the total memory (`m`) used by its variables.\n\n2.  **Comparison Logic:**\n    *   Lexicographical comparison means comparing strings character by character from left to right.\n    *   The comparison stops at the first position where the two strings have different characters. The string with the smaller character at this position is considered lexicographically smaller.\n    *   The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means 'a' is equivalent to 'A', 'b' to 'B', and so on. Before comparing characters, they should be converted to a common case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase). The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is perfect for this.\n    *   If all characters are the same (after case conversion), the strings are considered equal.\n\n3.  **Memory Efficiency Strategy:**\n    *   A standard approach would be to declare two character arrays, read both strings into them, and then compare. For a maximum length of 100, this would require `char s1[101]` and `char s2[101]`, using `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the string buffers.\n    *   To be \"most memory-efficient,\" we must minimize the amount of data we store.\n    *   The input format specifies two separate lines. This means we must finish reading the first string before we can begin reading the second. Therefore, we **must** store the first string in memory to have it available for comparison.\n    *   However, we can avoid storing the entire second string. We can read the second string one character at a time and immediately compare it with the corresponding character of the stored first string. This eliminates the need for a second large buffer.\n\n4.  **The Most Memory-Efficient Algorithm:**\n    a.  Declare a character array `s1` of size 101 to store the first string (100 characters + 1 for the null terminator `\\0`).\n    b.  Read the first string from standard input into `s1`.\n    c.  Declare an integer variable `i` to use as an index, initialized to 0.\n    d.  Declare a character variable `c2` to hold each character read from the second string.\n    e.  Enter a loop that continues as long as we can read a character for the second string and haven't reached the end of the first string.\n    f.  Inside the loop:\n        i.  Read one character from the standard input into `c2`. A careful way to do this is using `scanf(\" %c\", &c2)`, where the leading space in the format string skips any whitespace (including the newline character left after reading the first string).\n        ii. Compare `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower(c2)`.\n        iii. If `tolower(s1[i])` is less than `tolower(c2)`, the first string is smaller. Print \"-1\" and terminate the program.\n        iv. If `tolower(s1[i])` is greater than `tolower(c2)`, the first string is larger. Print \"1\" and terminate the program.\n        v. If they are equal, increment `i` and continue the loop.\n    g.  If the loop finishes without finding any difference, the strings are equal. Print \"0\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Buffer Sizing:** String length is up to 100. In C, a string buffer needs an extra byte for the null terminator `\\0`. Thus, the minimum size for the buffer is `100 + 1 = 101`.\n*   **Input Handling:** `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` stops at the first whitespace and leaves it in the input stream. When reading the second string character-by-character with `scanf(\"%c\", ...)` or `getchar()`, this leftover whitespace (a newline `\\n`) must be handled. Using `scanf(\" %c\", ...)` is a robust way to skip it.\n*   **Data Types and Sizes:** To calculate memory usage, we must know the size of the data types. On typical competitive programming platforms (using a 32-bit or 64-bit compiler like GCC), we have:\n    *   `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n    *   `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n*   **Variable Scope:** We only need to count the memory for variables declared to solve the problem. Temporary values held in CPU registers (like the return value of a function call) are not typically counted as part of the variable memory footprint.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition (Calculating `m`)\n\nBased on the most memory-efficient algorithm described above, we identify the necessary variables and calculate their total size.\n\n1.  **`char s1[101];`**: To store the first string.\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n2.  **`int i;`**: To act as an index for `s1`.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n3.  **`char c2;`**: To store one character at a time from the second string.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\n\n`m = 101 (for s1) + 4 (for i) + 1 (for c2)`\n`m = 106` bytes.\n\nThis approach is minimal because storing the first string is unavoidable, and an index and a temporary character variable are the bare minimum needed for the comparison loop.\n\n<<<106>>>"
