No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Gödel's ontological proof operate in fundamentally different, non-overlapping domains. Quantum mechanics is a physical theory using Hilbert spaces and operators to model observable reality. Gödel's proof is a metaphysical argument within modal logic, based on axioms about abstract concepts like "positive properties" and "necessary existence." There is no way to translate the concepts of one system into the other in a meaningful, non-arbitrary way, making a proof impossible. Attempting to do so would be a category error.
