The two problems are:
1.  **The Problem of Contradictory Classification:** The JTB definition states that knowledge is a type of belief, meaning knowledge is a subset of belief. However, the problem's constraint establishes Knowledge and Belief as two mutually exclusive epistemic states. This creates a contradiction: to acquire Knowledge, one must have a Belief, but having a Belief precludes one from being in the state of Knowledge.
2.  **The Problem of Justificatory Foundation (Infinite Regress):** The justification for any piece of Knowledge must itself be held as either Knowledge or Belief. If it is a Belief, it is by definition not-Knowledge and thus an inadequate foundation (as it may be unjustified or false). If it is Knowledge, it too requires justification, leading to an infinite and impossible regress where every piece of knowledge must be justified by another piece of knowledge.
