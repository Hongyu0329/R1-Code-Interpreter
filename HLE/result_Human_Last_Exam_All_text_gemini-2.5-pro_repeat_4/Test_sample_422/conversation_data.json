    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Components\n1.  **Core Theory**: The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of Knowledge is assumed. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    *   P is true (T).\n    *   S believes P (B).\n    *   S is justified in believing P (J).\n2.  **Core Constraint 1**: We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are scenarios where a person has a justified true belief by sheer luck, and intuition suggests they don't actually have knowledge. We must find other problems.\n3.  **Core Constraint 2**: The only available epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This is a highly restrictive, artificial system. It implies that for any proposition P, a person's mental state towards it is either one of knowing P or one of believing P, but not both or something else. These two states are mutually exclusive.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Interaction of the Theory and Constraints\nThe main task is to see what logical issues arise when the JTB theory, which describes a relationship between knowledge and belief, is forced into a system where Knowledge and Belief are strictly separate outcomes.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Relationship between Knowledge and Belief**\n*   In the JTB definition, Knowledge is a *type* of belief. It is a subset of belief (the subset that is also true and justified).\n*   In the problem's constrained system, Knowledge and Belief are mutually exclusive categories. If your state is Knowledge, it cannot be Belief, and vice-versa.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Nature of Justification**\n*   The 'J' in JTB requires that a belief be supported by good reasons or evidence.\n*   The question then arises: what is the epistemic state of the believer towards those reasons themselves? According to the system's rules, the state regarding the justifying reasons must also be either \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\".\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Two Problems from the Analysis\n\n**Problem 1: The Problem of Contradictory Classification**\n\nThis problem arises from the conflict between how JTB defines the relationship between knowledge and belief and how the constrained system defines it.\n\n*   **JTB says:** Knowledge is a type of Belief (`Knowledge ⊂ Belief`). To have knowledge, you must first have the belief.\n*   **The System says:** Knowledge and Belief are mutually exclusive states (`Knowledge ∩ Belief = ∅`). If you are in the state of Belief, you cannot be in the state of Knowledge.\n*   **The Conflict:** The system creates a logical paradox. To achieve the state of \"Knowledge\", the JTB definition requires you to fulfill the \"Belief\" condition. However, the moment you are in the state of \"Belief\", the system's rules forbid you from being in the state of \"Knowledge\". Therefore, the conditions for achieving knowledge can never be met. The definition becomes incoherent within this system.\n\n**Problem 2: The Problem of Justificatory Foundation (An Infinite Regress)**\n\nThis problem arises when we question what justifies the belief in the first place.\n\n*   **The Setup:** According to JTB, to have Knowledge of a proposition P (`K(P)`), you must have a justification for it. Let's say your justification relies on another proposition, Q.\n*   **The Dilemma:** What is your epistemic state regarding this justifying proposition Q? According to the system's rules, it must be either Knowledge (`K(Q)`) or Belief (`B(Q)`).\n    *   **Case A: The justification is a \"Belief\" (`B(Q)`).** If your state regarding Q is Belief, then by definition of this system, it is *not Knowledge*. This means it fails at least one of the JTB conditions (it's either not true or not justified). A justification that is itself unjustified or false cannot serve as a valid foundation for Knowledge. Thus, `K(P)` is not possible.\n    *   **Case B: The justification is \"Knowledge\" (`K(Q)`).** If you know Q, then `K(Q)` itself must be a justified true belief. This means `K(Q)` requires its own justification, let's say proposition R. We now face the same dilemma for R: is it known or believed?\n*   **The Conclusion:** This forces an impossible choice. Either the chain of justification is built upon a mere \"Belief\", which is an inadequate foundation, or the chain consists of an infinite series of \"Knowledge\" states (`K(P)` is justified by `K(Q)`, which is justified by `K(R)`, and so on). A finite mind cannot possess an infinite chain of justifications. Therefore, under this system, no belief can ever be successfully justified.\n\n<<<The two problems are:\n1.  **The Problem of Contradictory Classification:** The JTB definition states that knowledge is a type of belief, meaning knowledge is a subset of belief. However, the problem's constraint establishes Knowledge and Belief as two mutually exclusive epistemic states. This creates a contradiction: to acquire Knowledge, one must have a Belief, but having a Belief precludes one from being in the state of Knowledge.\n2.  **The Problem of Justificatory Foundation (Infinite Regress):** The justification for any piece of Knowledge must itself be held as either Knowledge or Belief. If it is a Belief, it is by definition not-Knowledge and thus an inadequate foundation (as it may be unjustified or false). If it is Knowledge, it too requires justification, leading to an infinite and impossible regress where every piece of knowledge must be justified by another piece of knowledge.>>>"
