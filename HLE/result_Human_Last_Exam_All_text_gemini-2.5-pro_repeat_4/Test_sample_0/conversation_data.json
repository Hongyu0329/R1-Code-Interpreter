    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a theory in population ethics for evaluating the goodness of populations. It calculates the value of a population by summing up the \"utility contributions\" of each person. The contribution of a person with welfare level `w` is not simply `w`, but `w - c`, where `c` is a fixed \"critical level.\"\n\n*   **Value of a Population (P)** = Î£ (w_i - c) for every individual `i` in P.\n*   **Key Implication:** Adding a new person with welfare `w` to a population is considered a good thing only if `w > c`. If `w < c`, adding that person makes the population worse, even if their life is worth living (i.e., `w > 0`). If `w = c`, adding the person has a neutral effect on the population's value.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's impossibility theorems show that several intuitively desirable ethical principles for ranking populations cannot all be true at the same time. The sixth theorem uses the following set of conditions (or very similar formulations):\n\n1.  **Egalitarian Dominance:** If population A has the same number of people as population B, everyone in A is better off than their counterpart in B, and A has a more equal distribution of welfare, then A is better than B. (A simpler version, sufficient for our analysis, is that if A and B have the same size and A Pareto-dominates B, A is better).\n2.  **General Non-Extreme Priority:** For any welfare level `w`, there is some very large population of people enjoying a slightly lower welfare level (`w-`) that is better than a smaller population of people at welfare level `w`. This condition ensures that numbers matter; a large enough number of people can compensate for a small loss in individual welfare.\n3.  **Non-Elitism:** There is at least one welfare level `w` such that for any population consisting only of people at level `w`, adding one more person at a slightly lower level (`w-`) can result in a better population. This prevents a theory from saying that a population of \"elite\" individuals is always better than any larger population containing less-well-off people.\n4.  **Weak Non-Sadism:** An equally distributed population where everyone has positive welfare is better than an equally distributed population of the same size where everyone has negative welfare.\n5.  **Weak Quality Addition:** There is at least one situation where adding a person with positive welfare to a population makes the new population better.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Which Condition is Violated by Critical-Level Views\n\nLet's test a critical-level view (with `c > 0`) against each condition.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** Let population A and B have `N` people each. Let each person `i` in A have welfare `w_Ai` and each person `i` in B have `w_Bi`. If `w_Ai > w_Bi` for all `i`, then `(w_Ai - c) > (w_Bi - c)`. Summing over all `i`, the total value of A will be greater than the total value of B. Critical-level views satisfy this.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This condition states that for *any* welfare level `w`, we can find a sufficiently large population at a slightly lower welfare level that is better. Let's test this with a critical-level view.\n    *   Choose a welfare level `w` such that `0 < w < c` (i.e., a life worth living, but below the critical level).\n    *   Consider a population A with `n` people, all at welfare level `w`.\n        *   Value(A) = `n * (w - c)`. Since `w < c`, this value is negative.\n    *   Consider a population B with `m` people (`m > n`), all at a slightly lower welfare level `w-` (where `w- < w`).\n        *   Value(B) = `m * (w- - c)`. Since `w- < w < c`, `(w- - c)` is also negative, and it is *more negative* than `(w - c)`.\n    *   The condition requires that we can find an `m` large enough to make B better than A, meaning `Value(B) > Value(A)`.\n        *   `m * (w- - c) > n * (w - c)`\n    *   Since both `(w- - c)` and `(w - c)` are negative numbers, when we divide by them, we must flip the inequality sign. Let's rewrite it with positive numbers to be clearer. Let `k = c - w` and `j = c - w-`. Then `j > k > 0`. The inequality becomes:\n        *   `m * (-j) > n * (-k)`\n        *   `mj < nk`\n        *   `m < n * (k/j)`\n    *   Since `j > k`, the fraction `(k/j)` is less than 1. This means that for B to be better than A, its population `m` must be *smaller* than `n`. This directly contradicts the premise of the condition, which requires us to be able to find a *larger* population `m` that is better.\n    *   Therefore, critical-level views violate General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This requires that for *at least one* welfare level `w`, adding a person at a slightly lower level can be an improvement.\n    *   Let's choose a welfare level `w > c`. Let `w-` also be greater than `c`.\n    *   The value of adding a person with welfare `w-` is `(w- - c)`. Since `w- > c`, this value is positive. Adding this person increases the total value of the population.\n    *   Since we found such a case, critical-level views satisfy Non-Elitism.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** Let A be a population with positive welfare `w > 0` and B be a population of the same size with negative welfare `w' < 0`. Since `w > w'`, it follows that `(w - c) > (w' - c)`. Thus, the value of A is greater than the value of B. Critical-level views satisfy this.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This requires that adding a person with positive welfare (`w > 0`) can *sometimes* be an improvement. If we pick a person with welfare `w` such that `w > c` (which also means `w > 0`), their contribution `(w - c)` is positive, and adding them improves the population's value. Critical-level views satisfy this.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that critical-level views fail to meet the **General Non-Extreme Priority** condition. The failure occurs because for any welfare level below the critical level, creating larger populations is always judged to be worse than creating smaller populations, no matter how large the population gets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
