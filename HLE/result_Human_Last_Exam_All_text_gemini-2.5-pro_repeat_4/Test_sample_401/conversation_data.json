    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of composants in an indecomposable continuum, with the important clarification that the continuum is not necessarily metric.\n\n1.  **What is a continuum?**\n    In general topology, a continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The question explicitly states it is \"not necessarily metric,\" so we must use this general definition and not assume properties that hold only for metric spaces.\n\n2.  **What is an indecomposable continuum?**\n    A continuum $X$ is called decomposable if it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua (i.e., $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are continua, $A \\subsetneq X$, and $B \\subsetneq X$). If a continuum is not decomposable, it is called indecomposable.\n\n3.  **What is a composant?**\n    For a point $p$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $x \\in X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $x$. The relation \"$x$ is in the composant of $p$\" is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are the composants of the continuum. The set of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space.\n\n4.  **The Core Problem:**\n    The question is to find the minimum value for the cardinality of this partition (the number of composants) for any space $X$ that is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Composants vs. Components:** The question helpfully clarifies \"composants (not components)\". A component is a maximal connected subset. Since a continuum is itself connected, it has only one component: the space itself. Composants are a different, more subtle concept.\n2.  **Metric vs. Non-Metric:** This is the most crucial point. For *metric* indecomposable continua (like the pseudo-arc), a famous theorem by Mazurkiewicz shows that they must have uncountably many ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants. The argument relies on the Baire Category Theorem combined with the fact that in a metric space, each composant is a meagre set (a countable union of nowhere-dense sets). The question's \"not necessarily metric\" clause signals that this result may not apply and a different answer is possible.\n3.  **Properties of Composants in Indecomposable Continua:** In any indecomposable continuum, every composant is a dense subset. Also, any proper subcontinuum is a nowhere-dense set (its interior is empty).\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\n**Step 1: Establishing a Lower Bound**\n\nAn indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. We can prove this by showing the following theorem holds for all continua (metric or not):\n*Theorem: A continuum $X$ is indecomposable if and only if it has more than one composant.*\n\n*Proof Sketch:*\n*   If a continuum $X$ is decomposable (i.e., $X=A \\cup B$ for proper subcontinua $A, B$), then it has only one composant. For any two points $x,y \\in X$, one can show they belong to the same composant by using a point $z$ in the non-empty intersection $A \\cap B$. Both $x$ and $z$ lie in a proper subcontinuum ($A$ or $B$), and so do $y$ and $z$. By transitivity, $x$ and $y$ are in the same composant.\n*   The contrapositive is: if a continuum has more than one composant, it must be indecomposable.\n*   If a continuum $X$ is indecomposable, we can show it must have more than one composant. If it had only one, then for any point $p$, the union of all proper subcontinua containing $p$ would be the entire space $X$. This implies that the collection of all proper subcontinua of $X$ is a directed family (under set inclusion) whose union is $X$. However, a well-known theorem in general topology states that a compact space cannot be the union of a directed family of proper closed subsets. This provides a contradiction.\n\nFrom this theorem, we conclude that any indecomposable continuum must have at least **two** composants.\n\n**Step 2: Showing the Lower Bound is Achievable**\n\nThe lower bound of 2 is only the minimum possible value if there actually exists an indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants. In the context of metric spaces, such an object does not exist. However, in the more general non-metric setting, such continua have been constructed.\n\n*   In 1960, S. Mardešić constructed an example of a non-metric indecomposable continuum that has exactly two composants.\n*   In 1964, J. L. Cornette also published a (different) construction of a non-metric indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants.\n\nThe existence of these mathematical objects demonstrates that the number of composants can be as small as two.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\n1.  From Step 1, the number of composants in any indecomposable continuum must be greater than 1, so it must be at least 2.\n2.  From Step 2, the number 2 is an achievable value.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
