    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core requirements are to identify two languages that satisfy three conditions:\n    *   They are from two distinct Asian cultures.\n    *   These cultures have no history of direct contact that would explain linguistic borrowing.\n    *   The words for \"broom\", \"mom\", and \"dad\" are nearly identical or highly similar in both languages.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & The \"Mom/Dad\" Clue:**\n    *   The words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are a good starting point. Across many unrelated languages, these words (known as nursery words) are often formed from the simple sounds babies make, like /ma/, /pa/, /da/, /ba/. For example, `mama`, `papa`, `dada`, `baba`.\n    *   We need to find a pair of languages where the similarity is particularly striking and extends beyond this common phenomenon.\n    *   Let's examine Korean and Tamil (a major Dravidian language from Southern India and Sri Lanka).\n        *   **Mom:** In Korean, it's **엄마 (eomma)**. In Tamil, it's **அம்மா (amma)**. These are virtually identical.\n        *   **Dad:** In Korean, it's **아빠 (appa)**. In Tamil, it's **அப்பா (appa)**. These are identical.\n    *   This pair is an extremely strong candidate based on the first two words alone.\n\n3.  **Verifying the \"No Direct Contact\" Condition:**\n    *   **Language Family:** Korean belongs to the Koreanic language family (often treated as a language isolate). Tamil belongs to the Dravidian language family. These two families are genetically unrelated.\n    *   **Geography and History:** Korea is in East Asia, while the Tamil-speaking region is in South Asia. They are separated by thousands of kilometers. While there is a single, ancient legend of a princess from a distant land (\"Ayuta,\" which some speculate was in India) marrying a Korean king, this does not represent the kind of sustained, population-level contact required for borrowing such fundamental vocabulary.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Korean and Tamil satisfy the \"no direct contact\" condition.\n\n4.  **Finding the Third Word: \"Broom\"**\n    *   This is the crucial final step. The similarity in parental terms is remarkable, but the question requires a match for \"broom\" as well.\n    *   **Korean:** The word for \"broom\" is **비 (bi)**. It is pronounced like the English letter \"B\".\n    *   **Tamil:** The common word for broom is `thudaippam`. However, looking at the verb \"to sweep,\" we find **பெருக்கு (perukku)**. The Proto-Dravidian root for \"to sweep\" or \"broom\" is often reconstructed as **\\*piru**.\n    *   **Comparison:** Let's compare the Korean noun **bi** with the Tamil root **piru**.\n        *   **Korean:** `bi` (a bilabial stop `[b]` followed by a high front vowel `[i]`)\n        *   **Tamil Root:** `piru` (a bilabial stop `[p]` followed by a high front vowel `[i]` and then `[ru]`)\n    *   The core initial syllable of both words is phonetically very similar: `bi` and `pi-`. This is considered a \"high similarity\" in the context of linguistic coincidences, especially when paired with the near-identical words for \"mom\" and \"dad\".\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Coincidence vs. Relation:** While these similarities are striking, the overwhelming consensus among linguists is that they are a remarkable coincidence, not evidence of a shared linguistic ancestry. The grammatical structures and the rest of the vocabularies of Korean and Tamil are vastly different.\n*   **Word Choice:** The similarity for \"broom\" relies on comparing the modern Korean noun with an ancient reconstructed root or a modern verb in Tamil. The most common modern nouns for \"broom\" in Tamil are not as similar. However, the phonetic link through the verb \"to sweep\" is strong enough to satisfy the \"highly similar\" criterion for this type of question.\n*   **Pronunciation:** `Eomma` (Korean) and `Amma` (Tamil) are audibly very close. `Appa` is identical in both. `Bi` and `Piru` share the key `p/b` + `i` sound structure.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two languages that fit all the criteria are **Korean** and **Tamil**.\n\n*   **Languages:** Korean and Tamil.\n*   **Cultures:** Korean (East Asia) and Tamil/Dravidian (South Asia).\n*   **Words:**\n    *   **Mom:** 엄마 (eomma) vs. அம்மா (amma)\n    *   **Dad:** 아빠 (appa) vs. அப்பா (appa)\n    *   **Broom:** 비 (bi) vs. the root *piru (related to the verb \"to sweep\")\n\n<<<Korean and Tamil>>>"
