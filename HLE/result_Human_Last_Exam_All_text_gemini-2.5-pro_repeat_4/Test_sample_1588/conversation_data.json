    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula\n\nThe BCH formula provides a solution for Z in the equation $e^Z = e^X e^Y$, where X and Y are non-commuting variables (like matrices). The solution Z is expressed as an infinite series of nested commutators of X and Y.\n\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nHere, $Z_n(X, Y)$ is the sum of all terms of total degree n. A term's degree is the total number of X's and Y's it contains. For example:\n*   $Z_1 = X + Y$ (degree 1)\n*   $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$ (degree 2)\n*   $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [Y, X]]$ (degree 3)\n\n### Step 2: Connecting the Problem to Free Lie Algebras\n\nThe terms in the BCH expansion are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, X and Y, which we denote as L(X, Y). This algebra has a natural grading by degree:\n\n$L(X, Y) = \\bigoplus_{n=1}^{\\infty} L_n(X, Y)$\n\nwhere $L_n(X, Y)$ is the vector subspace spanned by all nested commutators of total degree n. The number of linearly independent commutators of degree n is the dimension of this subspace, denoted as $dim(L_n)$.\n\nThe BCH term $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a specific linear combination of a basis of $L_n(X, Y)$. It is a known result that for any basis of $L_n(X, Y)$, all the coefficients in the expression for $Z_n$ are non-zero. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients of order n is simply the dimension of the space $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\nOur task is to find the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10, which means we need to calculate the dimension of $L_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n### Step 3: Using Witt's Formula\n\nThe dimension of the n-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on k generators is given by Witt's formula:\n\n$dim(L_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nWhere:\n*   n is the degree (order), which is 10 in our case.\n*   k is the number of generators, which is 2 (X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors d of n.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n### Step 4: Applying Witt's Formula for n=10, k=2\n\n1.  **Identify the parameters:**\n    *   n = 10\n    *   k = 2\n\n2.  **Find the divisors of n=10:**\n    The divisors (d) are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = \\mu(2)\\mu(5) = (-1)(-1) = 1$ (10 is a product of two distinct primes)\n\n4.  **Substitute these values into Witt's formula:**\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d \\in \\{1,2,5,10\\}} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\n5.  **Calculate each term in the summation:**\n    *   For d=1: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1 \\cdot 1024 = 1024$\n    *   For d=2: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = -1 \\cdot 2^5 = -1 \\cdot 32 = -32$\n    *   For d=5: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = -1 \\cdot 2^2 = -1 \\cdot 4 = -4$\n    *   For d=10: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$\n\n6.  **Sum the terms and divide by n:**\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2)$\n    $dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} (990)$\n    $dim(L_{10}) = 99$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is equal to the dimension of the degree-10 subspace of the free Lie algebra on two generators. This dimension is calculated to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
