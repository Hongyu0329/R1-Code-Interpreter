No. Structurally, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not polysaccharides. They differ fundamentally in their monomeric units (nucleotide vs. monosaccharide), their backbone composition (sugar-phosphate vs. sugar-only), and the chemical bonds that link the monomers (phosphodiester bonds vs. glycosidic bonds).
