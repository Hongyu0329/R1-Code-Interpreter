Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. The tunneling phenomenon is determined by the potential energy surface and the reduced mass of the molecule, neither of which is affected by the nuclear spin of the hydrogen atoms. While the change from fermionic (spin-1/2) to bosonic (spin-0) hydrogen nuclei alters the allowed rotational states due to the Pauli principle, it does not eliminate the existence of the tunneling-split energy levels themselves. Both the upper and lower states of the inversion doublet would still have allowed rotational levels associated with them, so the tunneling splitting would persist.
