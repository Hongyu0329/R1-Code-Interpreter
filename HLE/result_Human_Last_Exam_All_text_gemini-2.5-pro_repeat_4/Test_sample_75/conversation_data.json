    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Scope of the \"Second Great War\":** The Second Great War is the name given to the galaxy-spanning conflict that takes place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). The war's central antagonist is the fallen Xel'naga, Amon, and his various forces. The war is not truly over until Amon is permanently defeated.\n\n2.  **Identify the Starting Point:** The war officially begins with the renewed Zerg Swarm invasion of the Terran Dominion. This event marks the beginning of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft lore timeline, this occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Ending Point:** The war concludes with the final and absolute destruction of Amon. While Amon's physical form is defeated at the end of the main *Legacy of the Void* campaign, his spirit endures in the Void. The final confrontation happens in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*.\n    *   The main *Legacy of the Void* campaign ends in the year **2506**.\n    *   The epilogue campaign takes place after a period of rebuilding. The story explicitly states there is a **two-year time skip** between the end of the main campaign and the events of the epilogue.\n    *   Therefore, the final battle against Amon in the Void occurs in the year 2506 + 2 = **2508**. This marks the definitive end of the Second Great War.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:** To find the total duration, we subtract the start year from the end year.\n    *   Start Year: 2504\n    *   End Year: 2508\n    *   Duration = 2508 - 2504 = **4 years**.\n\n5.  **Apply Rounding:** The question asks for the answer in years, rounded up. Since the calculated duration is a whole number (4), rounding it up does not change the value.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing from the First Great War:** The first Great War and the subsequent Brood War (2499-2500) are separate conflicts that occurred prior to the events of *StarCraft II*.\n*   **Including the Epilogue:** It is crucial to include the *Into the Void* epilogue in the calculation. The war against Amon, the primary conflict of the saga, is not resolved until his defeat in the epilogue. Excluding it would inaccurately shorten the war's timeline to just two years (2504-2506).\n*   **The Time Skip:** A key detail is the two-year gap between the main *Legacy of the Void* campaign and the epilogue, which places the war's conclusion in 2508, not 2506.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the total duration of the Second Great War is 4 years.\n\n<<<4>>>"
