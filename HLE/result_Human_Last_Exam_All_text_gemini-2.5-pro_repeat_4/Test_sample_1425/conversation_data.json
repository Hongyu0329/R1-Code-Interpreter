    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for the given system using the path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Grand Canonical Ensemble and Partition Function**\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble describes a system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir at constant temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. The partition function, Z, is defined as the trace of the density operator for this ensemble:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})})$\nwhere:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant).\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\text{Tr}(...)$ denotes the trace over a complete set of states.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Grand Canonical Hamiltonian for the Specific System**\n\nThe problem specifies that the system's Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. We substitute this into the general formula for the partition function. The operator in the exponent, often called the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K}$, is:\n$\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$\n\nTherefore, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})}) = \\text{Tr}(e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}})$\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Partition Function as a Path Integral**\n\nThe path integral formalism provides a method to calculate the trace. The partition function can be expressed as a functional integral over fields $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ and their complex conjugates $\\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$, where $\\tau$ is the imaginary time variable ($0 \\le \\tau \\le \\beta$).\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n\nThe action, $S$, is related to the operator in the exponent of the trace. For a system of non-interacting particles, the action is generally given by:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\hat{h} - \\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\nwhere $\\hat{h}$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator corresponding to the system Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Action for the Given System**\n\nFirst, we need to find the single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{h}$. The total Hamiltonian is given by $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. In second quantization, the number operator is $\\hat{N} = \\sum_k \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$, where $k$ labels a complete set of single-particle states (e.g., momentum states).\nSo, $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\sum_k \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$.\nBy comparing this with the general form $\\hat{H} = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger \\hat{a}_k$, we can identify the single-particle energy for each state $k$ as:\n$\\epsilon_k = -\\mu$\n\nNow, we can write the action for our specific grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$. The general expression for the action involves the term $(\\hat{h} - \\mu)$. In our case, this becomes:\n$\\epsilon_k - \\mu = (-\\mu) - \\mu = -2\\mu$\n\nThis term, $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$, is the single-particle grand canonical energy. For this system, it is constant for all modes: $\\xi_k = -2\\mu$.\n\nThe action can be decomposed into a sum over the independent modes $k$:\n$S = \\sum_k S_k = \\sum_k \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, a_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) a_k(\\tau)$\nHere, $a_k^*(\\tau)$ and $a_k(\\tau)$ are the field variables (Grassmann numbers for fermions, complex numbers for bosons) corresponding to the operators $\\hat{a}_k^\\dagger$ and $\\hat{a}_k$.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nSince the action is a sum over independent modes, the partition function factorizes into a product over the modes:\n$Z = \\prod_k Z_k = \\prod_k \\int \\mathcal{D}[a_k^*, a_k] e^{-S_k}$\n\nThe integral for a single mode $k$ is a standard result in many-body physics. The evaluation of this Gaussian path integral depends on the statistics of the particles (bosons or fermions). The general result for a single mode with grand canonical energy $\\xi_k$ is:\n*   For bosons: $Z_k = (1 - e^{-\\beta \\xi_k})^{-1}$\n*   For fermions: $Z_k = (1 + e^{-\\beta \\xi_k})$\n\nThis can be written compactly as $Z_k = (1 \\mp e^{-\\beta \\xi_k})^{\\mp 1}$, where the upper sign ($-$) is for bosons and the lower sign ($+$) is for fermions.\n\n**Step 6: Obtain the Final Result**\n\nWe now substitute our specific single-particle grand canonical energy, $\\xi_k = -2\\mu$, into this general formula:\n$Z_k = (1 \\mp e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)})^{\\mp 1} = (1 \\mp e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{\\mp 1}$\n\nThe total partition function is the product over all single-particle states $k$:\n$Z = \\prod_k Z_k = \\prod_k (1 \\mp e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{\\mp 1}$\n\nLet's write this out explicitly for each case:\n*   **For Bosons** (upper signs):\n    $Z_{\\text{bosons}} = \\prod_k (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1} = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n    (This result is physically meaningful only if $2\\beta\\mu < 0$, or $\\mu < 0$, to ensure convergence).\n*   **For Fermions** (lower signs):\n    $Z_{\\text{fermions}} = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinction between H and K**: It is crucial to distinguish the given Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ from the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N}$. This distinction is what leads to the factor of 2 in the final expression.\n2.  **Path Integral Action**: The correct form of the action must be used, which involves the single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$ derived from $\\hat{H}$.\n3.  **Particle Statistics**: The final result depends critically on whether the particles are bosons or fermions. The path integral for bosons uses commuting complex variables, while the one for fermions uses anti-commuting Grassmann variables, leading to different functional determinants.\n4.  **Index k**: The product $\\prod_k$ runs over a complete set of single-particle quantum states (e.g., momentum and spin). The result is a product over these modes because the Hamiltonian describes non-interacting particles.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles. We express the result for both bosons and fermions. The term $\\prod_k$ represents a product over all single-particle states $k$.\n\nFor a system of **bosons**:\n$Z = \\prod_k \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\nFor a system of **fermions**:\n$Z = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n\nThese two results can be written in a single compact form using the convention where the top sign is for bosons and the bottom sign is for fermions:\n$Z = \\prod_k (1 \\mp e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{\\mp 1}$\n\n<<<For bosons, the partition function is $Z = \\prod_k (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$. For fermions, the partition function is $Z = \\prod_k (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$. Here $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$ and the product is over all single-particle states $k$.>>>"
