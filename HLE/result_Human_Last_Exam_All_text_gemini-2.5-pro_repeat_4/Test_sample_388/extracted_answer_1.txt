The pharmacist should counsel Allison that taking Excedrin (which contains aspirin, an NSAID) while also taking Fluoxetine (an SSRI) significantly increases her risk of stomach bleeding. It would be safer for her to use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for her headache. Additionally, she should follow up with her doctor about the new headache, as it could be a side effect of her prescription medications.
