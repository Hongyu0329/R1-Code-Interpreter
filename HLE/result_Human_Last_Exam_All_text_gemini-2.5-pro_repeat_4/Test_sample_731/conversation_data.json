    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the semidihedral group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Semidihedral Group**\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 2^n, denoted SD_{2^n}, has the presentation:\nSD_{2^n} = <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2) - 1)>\n\nIn this problem, the size of the group is 512. Since 512 = 2^9, we have n = 9.\nThe group is G = SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}.\nThe presentation is:\nG = <r, s | r^(2^(9-1)) = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(9-2) - 1)>\nG = <r, s | r^256 = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>\n\nThe group G consists of 512 elements, which can be divided into two sets:\n1.  The cyclic subgroup <r> = {r^i | 0 <= i < 256}, which has 256 elements.\n2.  The coset s<r> = {sr^i | 0 <= i < 256}, which has 256 elements.\n\n**Step 2: Define a Power Subgroup**\n\nA subgroup H of a group G is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer m such that H is equal to the set of m-th powers of all elements in G. That is, H = G^m = {g^m | g ∈ G}. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the set G^m for different values of m**\n\nWe need to compute the set G^m for an integer m. The set G^m is the union of the sets of m-th powers of elements from <r> and s<r>.\nG^m = { (r^i)^m | 0 <= i < 256 } U { (sr^j)^m | 0 <= j < 256 }\n\nWe analyze the structure of G^m based on the parity of m.\n\n**Case 1: m is an odd integer**\n\n*   **Powers of elements in <r>:** The set of m-th powers of elements in <r> is { (r^i)^m } = { r^(im) }. Since <r> is a cyclic group of order 256, this set of powers forms the subgroup <r^m>. As m is odd, gcd(m, 256) = 1. Therefore, <r^m> = <r^1> = <r>. The entire cyclic subgroup <r> is generated.\n*   **Powers of elements in s<r>:** We need to compute (sr^j)^m. The order of the elements sr^j is either 2 (if j is even) or 4 (if j is odd).\n    *   If j is even, the order of sr^j is 2. Since m is odd, (sr^j)^m = sr^j.\n    *   If j is odd, the order of sr^j is 4. Since m is odd, (sr^j)^m is either sr^j (if m ≡ 1 mod 4) or (sr^j)^3 (if m ≡ 3 mod 4). In both subcases, the resulting set of elements { (sr^j)^m | j is odd } is the same as the original set { sr^j | j is odd }. This is because exponentiation by an odd number coprime to the order is a permutation of the elements of a cyclic group.\n*   **Combining the sets:** When m is odd, G^m = {r^i} U {sr^j} = G.\n    So, for any odd integer m, the power subgroup G^m is the group G itself. This gives us one power subgroup.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze G^m when m is an even integer**\n\nLet m = 2k for some integer k.\n\n*   **Powers of elements in <r>:** The set is { (r^i)^m } = <r^m> = <r^(gcd(m, 256))>.\n*   **Powers of elements in s<r>:** We compute (sr^j)^m = (sr^j)^(2k) = ((sr^j)^2)^k.\n    From the group relations, we can derive that (sr^j)^2 = r^(128j).\n    So, ((sr^j)^2)^k = (r^(128j))^k = r^(128jk).\n    *   If j is even (j=2p), then r^(128 * 2p * k) = r^(256pk) = 1 (the identity element).\n    *   If j is odd (j=2p+1), then r^(128 * (2p+1) * k) = r^(128k + 256pk) = r^(128k).\n    So, the set of m-th powers of elements in s<r> is {1, r^(128k)}.\n*   **Combining the sets:** G^m = <r^m> U {1, r^(128k)}.\n    We need to check if the element r^(128k) is already in the subgroup <r^m>.\n    Since m=2k, we have 128k = 64 * (2k) = 64m.\n    So, r^(128k) = r^(64m) = (r^m)^64. This element is indeed in <r^m>.\n    Therefore, for any even integer m, G^m = <r^m> = <r^(gcd(m, 256))>.\n\n**Step 5: Count the distinct power subgroups**\n\nWe have found all possible power subgroups:\n1.  G (when m is odd).\n2.  <r^d> where d = gcd(m, 256) for some even integer m.\n\nLet's find the number of distinct subgroups in the second case.\nSince m is even, d = gcd(m, 256) must be a multiple of gcd(2, 256) = 2.\nThe divisors of 256 are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256).\nThe even divisors of 256 are d ∈ {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}.\nFor each such d, we can choose m=d (which is even) to get gcd(m, 256) = d.\nSo, the possible subgroups are:\n<r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, <r^256>.\nNote that <r^256> = {1}, the trivial subgroup, which corresponds to m=256 (or m=0).\n\nThese 8 subgroups are all distinct cyclic subgroups of <r>.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the two cases:\n*   1 subgroup from the case where m is odd (the group G itself).\n*   8 distinct subgroups from the case where m is even (<r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^256>).\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nThe power subgroups are: G, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, and {1}.\n\n<<<9>>>"
