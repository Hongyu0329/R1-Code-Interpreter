    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the number of \"historical saints\" who are \"mentioned by name\" within the text of John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\". To answer this accurately, we must carefully define each component.\n\n*   **\"Historical Saint\"**: Milton was a devout Puritan, not a Catholic. His understanding of a \"saint\" would not be limited to figures canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. In the Protestant tradition, a \"saint\" (from the Greek *hagios*, meaning \"holy one\") refers to any true believer or righteous individual who is part of God's elect. For this analysis, a \"historical saint\" will be defined as any significant, righteous figure from the Old or New Testament narrative who is presented as part of God's plan for humanity's salvation. This includes progenitors, patriarchs, prophets, and apostles. Angels, being celestial beings, are excluded.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The figure must be explicitly named in the text. References to a figure by description or title alone (e.g., \"the Virgin,\" \"the Baptist\") are not sufficient unless their proper name is also given elsewhere. The name can be a variant spelling common in Milton's time (e.g., \"Noe\" for Noah).\n*   **\"In Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: This includes the entirety of the published work, which consists of the epic poem itself and the prose \"Arguments\" that Milton prefixed to each book in the second edition (1674). These arguments are part of the work and contain explicit mentions.\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Search and Enumeration\nThe majority of these figures are named in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael reveals future biblical history to Adam.\n\n**Old Testament Figures (Pre-Monarchy):**\n\n1.  **Adam**: Mentioned by name throughout the epic as the first man. He is a key historical figure who is ultimately promised redemption.\n2.  **Eve**: Mentioned by name throughout the epic as the first woman and is also promised redemption.\n3.  **Abel**: Named in Book XI. Michael shows Adam the story of the first murder, presenting Abel as the first righteous martyr. (\"...and in the field resides, / Two brethren, these, two colours in their coats, / Differing in trade, but not in hearts, I see...\") The story is told, and while the name is not in this direct quote, the context of the book makes it clear, referencing the story of Cain and Abel. His sacrifice is noted as accepted by God. The \"Argument\" of Book XI explicitly states \"the murder of **Abel** by Cain\".\n4.  **Enoch**: Named in Book XI. He is described as the \"onely just man alive\" of his time who \"walk'd with God\" and was taken directly to Heaven. (\"This was that **Enoch** of the seventh generation from thee...\")\n5.  **Noah**: Named as **Noe** (a common spelling of the time) in Book XI. He is the \"one Man found so perfet and so just\" chosen by God to survive the Great Flood and repopulate the Earth.\n6.  **Abraham**: Named in Book XII. Michael introduces him as the \"one faithful man\" from whom God will raise a great nation. (\"This Patriarch blest, / Whom faithful **ABRAHAM** due time shall call...\")\n7.  **Jacob**: He is named as **Israel** in Book XII, the name given to him after wrestling with the angel. (\"The Grand-son whose name **ISRAEL** he obtains / From that high Vision...\")\n8.  **Joseph**: Named in Book XII in the context of the Israelites' time in Egypt. (\"A new King rises, who knows not **JOSEPH**...\")\n9.  **Moses**: Named in Book XII. He is identified as the one who received the Law from God on Mount Sinai. (\"...the Law of God / Upon Mount Sinai giv'n by **Moses**' hand...\") He is also referenced earlier in Book I as \"Amram's son\".\n\n**Old Testament Figures (Monarchy/Prophets):**\n\n10. **David**: Named in Book XII. Michael prophesies a great king from whose \"Royal Stock\" the Messiah will come. (\"...That of the Royal Stock / Of **David** (so I name this King) shall rise / A Son...\")\n11. **Isaiah**: Named as **Isay** (a common spelling) in Book XII. He is mentioned as the prophet who foretold the coming of the Messiah. (\"His name shall be the Prince of Peace, foretold / By **Isay**...\")\n\n**New Testament Figures:**\n\n12. **Jesus**: The central figure of the Christian redemption story. While he is most often called \"the Son\" or \"Messiah\" in the verse, he is explicitly named **Jesus** in the prose \"Argument\" to Book III. Within the verse of Book XII, he is also given the prophetic name **Immanuel**. As the question asks for the number of individuals, these names all refer to one person.\n\n### Step 3: Review and Final Tally\nBy carefully searching the text according to the established definitions, we find the following named individuals who fit the criteria of \"historical saint\":\n\n1.  Adam\n2.  Eve\n3.  Abel\n4.  Enoch\n5.  Noah (Noe)\n6.  Abraham\n7.  Jacob (Israel)\n8.  Joseph\n9.  Moses\n10. David\n11. Isaiah (Isay)\n12. Jesus\n\nIt is important to note that many other significant biblical events are described, but the key figures are not always named. For instance, the stories of Joshua (making the sun stand still), Mary (the \"Virgin\"), and John the Baptist (the \"meaner hand\" who performs the baptism) are related without using their proper names. Therefore, they are not included in the count.\n\nThe final count of historical saints mentioned by name is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
