    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Chern Insulator:** A Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological insulator that exhibits a quantized Hall effect without an external magnetic field. Its defining topological property is the Chern number ($C$), which is an integer.\n*   **Chern Number (C):** The Chern number is a topological invariant of the bulk electronic band structure. It quantifies the topology of the system.\n*   **Physical Significance of the Chern Number:** The Chern number is directly related to the Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy}$) of the material through the formula:\n    $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n    where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n*   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** A Chern insulator with a non-zero Chern number $C$ will host $|C|$ gapless, chiral edge states on its boundary with a topologically trivial material (like a vacuum, where C=0). The sign of $C$ determines the direction of propagation (chirality) of these edge states.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the setup of the problem**\n\n*   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them System 1 and System 2.\n*   Both have a Chern number of 1: $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$.\n*   They are connected \"laterally\". This means they are placed side-by-side to form a larger, composite system. For electrical transport purposes, this configuration is equivalent to connecting two conductors in parallel.\n*   The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is a crucial point. It means the electrons can move freely between the two systems. The two insulators are not isolated but are strongly coupled to form a single, larger quantum system.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the principle of additivity of Hall conductivity**\n\n*   The question asks for the Chern number of the \"junction,\" which we interpret as the Chern number of the entire composite system.\n*   Since the Chern number is directly proportional to the Hall conductivity, we can determine the total Chern number by considering how the Hall conductivities of the two systems combine.\n*   When two conductors are placed in parallel (laterally), their total electrical conductance is the sum of their individual conductances. This principle applies to the Hall conductance as well.\n*   Therefore, the total Hall conductivity of the composite system ($\\sigma_{xy, \\text{total}}$) is the sum of the Hall conductivities of the individual systems ($\\sigma_{xy, 1}$ and $\\sigma_{xy, 2}$).\n    $\\sigma_{xy, \\text{total}} = \\sigma_{xy, 1} + \\sigma_{xy, 2}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total Chern number**\n\n*   Now, we substitute the relationship between Hall conductivity and the Chern number into the equation from Step 3.\n    $C_{\\text{total}} \\frac{e^2}{h} = C_1 \\frac{e^2}{h} + C_2 \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n*   We can cancel the fundamental constant term $\\frac{e^2}{h}$ from both sides of the equation. This gives us a simple rule for the addition of Chern numbers:\n    $C_{\\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2$\n*   Plugging in the given values for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n    $C_{\\text{total}} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Junction\":** The question asks for the Chern number of the \"junction\". A Chern number is a property of a bulk 2D system, not a 1D interface. Therefore, the question is asking for the effective Chern number of the combined 2D system.\n2.  **Importance of \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** If there were a significant barrier, the systems would be decoupled. We would have two separate Chern insulators, and it would not make sense to talk about a single Chern number for the combined entity. The negligible barrier ensures they form a single topological system.\n3.  **Interface States:** According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of chiral modes at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers $C_a$ and $C_b$ is given by $N = C_b - C_a$. In our case, at the interface between the two C=1 insulators, the number of net chiral edge modes is $N = C_2 - C_1 = 1 - 1 = 0$. This means there are no protected, net-propagating states at the internal junction. This is consistent with the two systems merging into a single topological phase with a uniform (or smoothly varying) bulk. The edge states of the composite system will only appear on its outer boundaries. The combined system, having $C_{total}=2$, will host two chiral edge states on its external boundary.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The system consists of two Chern insulators connected in parallel.\n2.  Chern number of the first insulator, $C_1 = 1$.\n3.  Chern number of the second insulator, $C_2 = 1$.\n4.  The Chern number of a composite system formed by joining two insulators in parallel is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\n5.  Total Chern Number, $C_{\\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
