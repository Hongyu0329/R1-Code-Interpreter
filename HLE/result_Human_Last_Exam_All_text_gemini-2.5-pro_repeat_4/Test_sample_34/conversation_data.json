    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack you should open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Scenario**\n\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the best position in poker, allowing us to play the widest range of hands profitably because we are guaranteed to act last post-flop.\n*   **Action:** Opening raise to 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard opening size.\n*   **Game Conditions:** 100BB deep cash game. The stack depth is standard.\n*   **Crucial Detail:** The game is **rake-free**. Rake is the fee the house takes from the pot. In a normal game, rake eats into the profitability of marginal hands. Without rake, the expected value (EV) of playing any given hand increases, meaning we should play a wider, more aggressive range of hands.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Hand Category \"Suited Jack\"**\n\n*   We are looking for a hand of the format Jxs, where 'x' is a card lower than a Jack.\n*   The possible hands, in descending order of general strength, are: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. (AJs, KJs, and QJs are premium hands and are not what the question implies by \"worst\").\n*   The value of these hands comes from three main sources:\n    1.  **High Card Strength:** The Jack provides decent high card value. The kicker ('x') also contributes. A higher kicker is better.\n    2.  **Flush Potential:** Being suited gives all these hands the ability to make a strong flush. The value of making *a* flush is similar across all these hands, though a higher kicker can sometimes be relevant.\n    3.  **Straight Potential:** The ability to make straights depends on how connected the two cards are. Closer cards (connectors like JTs) have much higher straight potential than widely gapped cards (like J2s).\n\n**Step 3: Rank the Suited Jack Hands**\n\n*   Based on the principles above, we can rank the hands.\n*   **JTs** is the strongest. It's a suited connector with the highest kicker. It makes many strong straights and flushes.\n*   As the kicker gets lower, the hand gets weaker. The straight potential also decreases. J9s (one-gapper) is strong. J8s (two-gapper) is still decent.\n*   The hands get progressively worse: J7s > J6s > J5s > J4s > J3s.\n*   **J2s** is the weakest hand in this category. It has the lowest possible kicker (the deuce) and the largest gap between the cards (9-gap), giving it the worst straight potential.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if the \"Worst\" Hand is a Profitable Open**\n\n*   The question is \"the worst suited jack you *should* open\". This implies we are looking for the hand with the lowest EV that is still a profitable open raise.\n*   In a standard 100BB cash game *with* rake, Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts show that the button should open a range of approximately 45-50% of hands. This range includes **all** suited Jacks, from JTs down to J2s.\n*   Now, consider the **rake-free** environment. The absence of rake makes every hand that was already profitable even *more* profitable. It also makes hands that were break-even or slightly losing (due to rake) become profitable opens.\n*   Therefore, if J2s is a standard open in a raked game, it is an even more clear and profitable open in a rake-free game. The opening range on the button in a rake-free game expands significantly, sometimes to 60% or more.\n*   Since all suited Jacks are profitable opens from the button in this scenario, the \"worst\" one that you should still open is simply the one with the lowest intrinsic value.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer**\n\n*   We have established that all suited Jacks (J2s through JTs) are profitable opens from the button.\n*   We have ranked these hands and identified J2s as the weakest among them due to its low kicker and poor straight potential.\n*   Therefore, J2s is the worst suited Jack that you should open from the button.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
