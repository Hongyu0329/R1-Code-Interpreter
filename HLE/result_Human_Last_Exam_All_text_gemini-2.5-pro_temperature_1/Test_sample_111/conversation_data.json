    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key figures and the date of the event.**\n    *   The question involves two historical figures: Geoffrey Chaucer, the renowned English poet, and Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt and a patroness of Chaucer.\n    *   The central event is the death of Blanche of Lancaster. We need to establish when this occurred. Historical records confirm that Blanche of Lancaster died on **12 September 1368**. The cause is widely believed to have been the plague. She died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n2.  **Determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location and role in 1368.**\n    *   To find out where Chaucer was, we must look at his biography around that year.\n    *   By 1367, Chaucer was established in the service of King Edward III of England. He was a member of the royal household, holding the rank of *esquire* (or *valettus*). This was a full-time position that placed him at the heart of the English court.\n    *   His role involved various duties, including diplomatic missions abroad. However, his primary base of operations and residence was in England, where the court was seated.\n    *   Records show that Chaucer was receiving his royal annuity (pension) during this period, which confirms his active service to the English crown.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the provided answer choices based on historical evidence.**\n    *   **A. Italy:** This is incorrect. Chaucer's first documented diplomatic mission to Italy did not occur until 1372-1373. Therefore, he could not have been in Italy in 1368.\n    *   **E. Scotland:** This is incorrect. There is no historical record or scholarly theory that places Chaucer in Scotland during this time.\n    *   **B. France:** This is a possibility, as Chaucer undertook several diplomatic missions to France during his career. Some biographers suggest he may have been on the continent during the summer of 1368. However, there is no definitive proof he was in France on the specific date of September 12, 1368. His duties were to the English court, and even if he was on a mission, it's most likely he would have been back in England by September, or at the very least, his official location was considered England.\n    *   **C. England:** This is the most likely answer. His official position was in the English royal household. Blanche of Lancaster, a prominent figure in that same court, died in England. Chaucer's famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, written shortly after her death as an elegy, strongly indicates his close connection to the court's affairs and its period of mourning in England. The weight of evidence firmly places his life and work in England during this time.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** While we do not have a diary entry from Chaucer for September 12, 1368, \"Unknown\" is not the best answer. Based on his established role, his patron's location, and his subsequent work, we can make a very strong and logical inference that he was in England. In historical questions of this nature, the most probable location based on available evidence is considered the correct answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on his position as an esquire in the royal court of Edward III, his known travel history (which excludes Italy and Scotland for that year), and the context of his poem *The Book of the Duchess*, the most historically accurate location for Geoffrey Chaucer at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death in September 1368 is England.\n\n<<<C>>>"
