    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the \"true profession\" of a specific individual, Andre Vernault. Key pieces of information provided are:\n*   **Who:** Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee.\n*   **When:** During World War II.\n*   **Where:** In the United Kingdom.\n*   **What happened:** He was wrongly suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence (MI5).\n*   **Why:** The suspicion arose because he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Central Mystery**\nThe mystery is the nature of his profession. It must have been something he felt was so compromising or shameful that he would risk being seen as a spy rather than admit to it. This suggests the profession was likely illegal, immoral, or socially taboo at the time.\n\n**Step 3: Research the Historical Case**\nThis is a specific historical event that can be researched in records and books about British intelligence during WWII. The case of Andre Vernault is a well-documented example used by historians to illustrate the challenges of vetting refugees and potential agents.\n*   Upon arriving in the UK, Vernault was interrogated by MI5. His evasive and dishonest answers about his background made his interrogators, particularly the famous spy-catcher Major R.W. \"Tin Eye\" Stephens, highly suspicious.\n*   His behavior fit the profile of a trained agent trying to hide their mission. He was lying, and MI5 assumed the lie was to cover up espionage activities.\n\n**Step 4: Uncover the True Profession and Motivation**\nHistorical accounts, notably in books like Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies,\" reveal the truth.\n*   Andre Vernault was not a spy. His true profession in Brussels was that of a **pimp** (or procurer of prostitutes).\n*   He concealed this fact because he was deeply ashamed of it and correctly assumed that the British authorities would take a very dim view of his activities. He feared he would be deported or imprisoned as an undesirable criminal if he told the truth.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nThe irony of the case is that Vernault's attempt to hide his non-political, criminal past made him appear to be a political enemy. His fear of being judged for his actual profession led him to act in a way that perfectly mimicked a spy, resulting in his internment as a suspected enemy agent. His true profession was not espionage, but one he considered too shameful to reveal.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nHis true profession, which he concealed from his interrogators, was that of a pimp.\n\n<<<Pimp>>>"
