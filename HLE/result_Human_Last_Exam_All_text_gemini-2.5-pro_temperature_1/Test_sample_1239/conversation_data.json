    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### **Step 1: Write down the equations**\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$) for a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ are:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:**\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n    (Here, density $\\rho$ is set to 1, and $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity).\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nThis is a system of 4 PDEs for 4 functions ($\\mathbf{u}=(u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and $p$) of 4 independent variables ($t, x_1, x_2, x_3$).\n\n### **Step 2: Define and identify the symmetries**\n\nA symmetry of these equations is a transformation of the independent and dependent variables that maps any solution to another solution. The set of all such continuous symmetries forms a Lie group. The dimension of this group is the number of independent parameters needed to specify a transformation near the identity, which is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators.\n\nWe can identify these symmetries by considering the physical principles underlying the equations.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$ (they are autonomous). This means they are invariant under a shift in time:\n    $t \\rightarrow t + s$\n    This is a one-parameter group of transformations.\n    **Dimension: 1**\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations are defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and their coefficients are constant. Thus, the physical laws are the same at all points in space. This implies invariance under spatial translations:\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$ for any constant vector $\\mathbf{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    This is a three-parameter group.\n    **Dimension: 3**\n\n3.  **Space Rotations:** The equations are isotropic, meaning there is no preferred direction in space. The differential operators $(\\nabla, \\nabla^2, \\cdot)$ and vector operations are invariant under rotations. The transformation acts on space and the vector field $\\mathbf{u}$:\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{u}$, where $R \\in SO(3)$ is a rotation matrix.\n    The group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$, is a three-parameter group.\n    **Dimension: 3**\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations obey Galilean relativity. If we switch to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$, the equations should retain their form. The transformation is:\n    $t \\rightarrow t$\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$\n    $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$\n    It can be verified that the momentum equation and the incompressibility condition are invariant under this transformation (the pressure $p$ remains unchanged). Since $\\mathbf{v}$ is an arbitrary constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this is a three-parameter group.\n    **Dimension: 3**\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry. If we scale the variables appropriately, the equations remain invariant. The correct scaling transformation is found to be:\n    $t \\rightarrow a^2 t$\n    $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow a \\mathbf{x}$\n    $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow a^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$\n    $p \\rightarrow a^{-2} p$\n    where $a$ is a positive real number. This is a one-parameter group of transformations.\n    **Dimension: 1**\n\n### **Step 3: Consider trivial or gauge symmetries**\n\nThe pressure $p$ only appears in the momentum equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This has an important consequence: the equations are invariant if we shift the pressure by a constant value:\n$p \\rightarrow p + c_0$\nThis transformation introduces another one-parameter symmetry group.\n**Dimension: 1**\n\n### **Step 4: Sum the dimensions**\n\nSumming the dimensions of all the independent one-parameter symmetries identified above gives the total dimension of the Lie group.\n\n*   Time translation: 1\n*   Space translations: 3\n*   Space rotations: 3\n*   Galilean boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n*   Pressure shift: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Infinite-dimensional symmetries:** The invariance of the equations under $p \\to p+c_0$ is a special case of a more general symmetry $p \\to p + f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is an arbitrary function of time. This implies that the full symmetry group is actually infinite-dimensional. However, in the context of classifying symmetries of differential equations, such \"gauge-like\" symmetries are often considered trivial or are eliminated by imposing boundary conditions or other physical constraints on the pressure. The standard question about \"the dimension of the Lie group\" refers to the maximal *finite-dimensional* point symmetry group.\n*   **Completeness:** The 12-dimensional group identified here is known from the classic works on symmetry analysis (e.g., by Lloyd, Ovsiannikov) to be the maximal finite-dimensional point symmetry group of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is the sum of the dimensions of the independent symmetry transformations. As calculated above, this sum is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
