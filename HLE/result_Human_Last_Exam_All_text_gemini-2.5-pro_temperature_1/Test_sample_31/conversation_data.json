    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be observed to uniquely distinguish between all 21 possible Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Pieces and Stickers\nIn the PLL step, the last layer (top layer) is already oriented, meaning the top face is a solid color. We only need to permute (rearrange) the last layer pieces.\n*   **Pieces:** There are 8 pieces in the last layer: 4 corners and 4 edges.\n*   **Stickers:** We are interested in the non-top-facing stickers, which are on the four side faces of the cube (e.g., Front, Right, Back, Left).\n    *   Each last layer edge has 1 side-facing sticker. Total: 4 edge stickers.\n    *   Each last layer corner has 2 side-facing stickers. Total: 8 corner stickers.\n    *   In total, there are 4 + 8 = 12 non-top-facing stickers on the last layer.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum number of these 12 stickers we need to see to know for sure which of the 21 PLL cases we have.\n\n### Step 2: The Parity Argument and Information Sufficiency\nA key property of the Rubik's Cube is that any legal move results in an even total permutation. The permutation of corners is either even or odd, and the permutation of edges is either even or odd. The sum of their parities must be even (i.e., they must have the same parity).\n*   (Corner Permutation Parity) + (Edge Permutation Parity) = Even\n\nThis property allows us to deduce the state of some pieces if we know the state of others. Let's see how many pieces we need to know the state of to determine the entire PLL.\n*   If we know the exact position and orientation of 7 of the 8 pieces, the position and orientation of the 8th piece is automatically determined.\n*   Let's try with 6 pieces. If we know the state of 6 pieces, what about the remaining 2? Let the known permutation of 6 pieces be P1, and the unknown permutation of the remaining 2 pieces be P2. The overall parity must be even. Parity(P1) + Parity(P2) = Even. This means Parity(P2) = Parity(P1). A permutation on 2 pieces can only be the identity (even parity) or a swap (odd parity). Since we can determine the required parity of P2 from P1, we can uniquely determine P2. It's either the identity or a swap.\n\nTherefore, knowing the exact position and orientation of any 6 of the 8 last layer pieces is sufficient to determine the entire permutation.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Stickers Needed to Identify Pieces\nNow, we find the minimum number of stickers needed to identify the state of 6 pieces. To minimize the number of stickers, we should choose the pieces that require the fewest stickers to identify.\n*   **To identify an edge piece:** An edge piece is defined by two colors (e.g., Yellow/Green). Its side sticker has one color (Green). Since all four last layer edges have distinct side colors (e.g., Green, Red, Blue, Orange), seeing this one sticker is enough to identify which edge piece is in that position. So, 1 sticker per edge.\n*   **To identify a corner piece:** A corner piece is defined by three colors (e.g., Yellow/Green/Orange). It has two side stickers (Green and Orange). If you only see one sticker (e.g., Green), you can't be sure which piece it is. For example, the Green/Orange corner and the Green/Red corner both have a Green sticker. To uniquely identify the corner and its orientation, you must see both of its side stickers. So, 2 stickers per corner.\n\nTo identify 6 pieces with the minimum number of stickers, we should choose all 4 edges and 2 corners.\n*   Stickers for 4 edges = 4 * 1 = 4 stickers.\n*   Stickers for 2 corners = 2 * 2 = 4 stickers.\n\nTotal stickers required = 4 + 4 = 8 stickers.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Sufficiency and Necessity\n**Sufficiency:** As proven above, seeing these 8 stickers allows us to fully identify 4 edges and 2 corners. This information is sufficient to deduce the state of the remaining 2 corners via the parity argument, thus identifying the PLL case uniquely. A valid set of 8 stickers would be: the 4 side-stickers of all four edges, and the 4 side-stickers of two adjacent corners (e.g., the front-left and front-right corners).\n\n**Necessity (Why not 7?):** If we try to see only 7 stickers, we cannot have full information for 6 pieces. For example, if we look at the 4 edge stickers and the stickers for one corner (4+2=6), plus one extra sticker from another corner, we cannot be sure of the identity of that second corner. The ambiguity in the state of even one piece breaks the chain of deduction based on parity. For any set of 7 stickers, it is possible to construct at least two different valid PLL cases that are consistent with those 7 stickers.\n\nA concrete example of ambiguity: Consider the scenario where the Front and Right faces appear to be solved. This requires observing 6 stickers. This single observation is consistent with three possible PLL cases: the solved state, a U-perm on the back-left, and an inverse U-perm on the back-left. To distinguish between these three, one must view at least one more sticker on the back or left faces. In some of these ambiguous situations, resolving the case requires knowing the state of a corner, which would require seeing two more stickers, bringing the total to 8. While some ambiguities can be solved with 7 stickers, there exist ambiguities that require 8. Since the question asks for a number that works for *all* cases, we must take the worst-case requirement.\n\nConclusion: 8 is sufficient, and 7 is not. Therefore, 8 is the minimum number of stickers that must be seen.\n\n>>>8"
