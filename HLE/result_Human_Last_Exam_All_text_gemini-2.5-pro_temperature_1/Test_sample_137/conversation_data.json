    "This problem asks for a Hurwitz number, which counts certain types of maps between surfaces. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem setup\n\n*   **Map:** We are considering ramified covers $f: \\mathbb{P}^1 \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$. These are holomorphic maps from the complex projective line (or Riemann sphere) to itself.\n*   **Degree (d):** The degree of the cover is $d=7$. This means that for a generic point $y \\in \\mathbb{P}^1$, its preimage $f^{-1}(y)$ consists of 7 distinct points.\n*   **Branch Points and Ramification Profiles:** The cover has exactly four branch points. The ramification profiles describe the structure of the fibers over these branch points. A partition $(p_1, p_2, ..., p_k)$ of $d$ means the fiber consists of $k$ points, and at these points the map locally looks like $z \\mapsto z^{p_i}$.\n    The given profiles are:\n    1.  $\\lambda_1 = (4,3)$\n    2.  $\\lambda_2 = (5,2)$\n    3.  $\\lambda_3 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$\n    4.  $\\lambda_4 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$\n\n### Step 2: Verifying the Riemann-Hurwitz Formula\n\nThe Riemann-Hurwitz formula relates the topological properties of the covering space, the base space, and the ramification data. For a cover $f: X \\to Y$ of degree $d$, the formula is:\n$\\chi(X) = d \\cdot \\chi(Y) - \\sum_{i} (d - |\\lambda_i|)$\nwhere $\\chi$ is the Euler characteristic and $|\\lambda_i|$ is the number of parts in the partition $\\lambda_i$ (i.e., the number of points in the fiber over the i-th branch point).\n\nFor our problem:\n*   Covering space $X = \\mathbb{P}^1$, so $\\chi(X) = 2$.\n*   Base space $Y = \\mathbb{P}^1$, so $\\chi(Y) = 2$.\n*   Degree $d = 7$.\n*   Ramification data:\n    *   $\\lambda_1=(4,3) \\implies |\\lambda_1|=2 \\implies d-|\\lambda_1| = 7-2=5$.\n    *   $\\lambda_2=(5,2) \\implies |\\lambda_2|=2 \\implies d-|\\lambda_2| = 7-2=5$.\n    *   $\\lambda_3=(2,1^5) \\implies |\\lambda_3|=6 \\implies d-|\\lambda_3| = 7-6=1$.\n    *   $\\lambda_4=(2,1^5) \\implies |\\lambda_4|=6 \\implies d-|\\lambda_4| = 7-6=1$.\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$2 = 7 \\cdot 2 - (5 + 5 + 1 + 1)$\n$2 = 14 - 12$\n$2 = 2$\nThe formula holds, confirming that such a cover can exist. The genus of the covering curve is 0, which corresponds to $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\n### Step 3: Translating to a Combinatorial Problem\n\nCounting such covers is equivalent to a problem in the symmetric group $S_d$. The Hurwitz number counts the number of ways to write the identity permutation as a product of permutations with specified cycle structures, corresponding to the ramification profiles.\nWe need to count the number of tuples of permutations $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ in $S_7$ such that:\n1.  $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_4 = \\text{id}$ (the identity permutation).\n2.  The cycle type of $\\sigma_i$ corresponds to the partition $\\lambda_i$.\n    *   `c(σ₁)` is (4,3).\n    *   `c(σ₂)` is (5,2).\n    *   `c(σ₃)` is (2,1,1,1,1,1), i.e., a single transposition.\n    *   `c(σ₄)` is (2,1,1,1,1,1), i.e., a single transposition.\n3.  The group $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$. (This corresponds to the cover being connected, which is required).\n\nA careful check shows that any such tuple of permutations will automatically generate a transitive group, so we do not need to impose this condition separately.\n\n### Step 4: Using the Formula for Double Hurwitz Numbers\n\nThis type of problem, with two arbitrary ramification profiles and several simple transpositions, is a known case called a \"double Hurwitz number\". There are established formulas to calculate them, often derived from character theory of the symmetric group or matrix models.\n\nThe relevant formula for the Hurwitz number $H$ of genus 0, with two specified profiles $\\mu_1, \\mu_2$ and $n$ simple transpositions, is:\n$H = \\frac{|C_{\\mu_1}| |C_{\\mu_2}|}{d!} \\sum_{\\lambda \\vdash d, \\, l(\\lambda) \\le n} \\binom{d-l(\\lambda)}{n-l(\\lambda)} \\chi^\\lambda(\\mu_1) \\chi^\\lambda(\\mu_2)$\n\nIn our case:\n*   $d=7$\n*   $n=2$ (two simple transpositions)\n*   $\\mu_1=(4,3)$ and $\\mu_2=(5,2)$\n*   $l(\\lambda)$ is the number of parts of the partition $\\lambda$.\n*   $\\chi^\\lambda(\\mu)$ is the value of the irreducible character of $S_d$ corresponding to partition $\\lambda$ on the conjugacy class corresponding to partition $\\mu$.\n*   $|C_\\mu|$ is the size of the conjugacy class.\n\n### Step 5: Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate Conjugacy Class Sizes:**\n    *   $|C_{(4,3)}| = \\frac{7!}{4 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{5040}{12} = 420$.\n    *   $|C_{(5,2)}| = \\frac{7!}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{5040}{10} = 504$.\n    *   $d! = 7! = 5040$.\n    *   The pre-factor is $\\frac{420 \\cdot 504}{5040} = \\frac{420}{10} = 42$.\n\n2.  **Perform the Sum:** The sum is over partitions $\\lambda$ of 7 with $l(\\lambda) \\le n=2$. These are $\\lambda \\in \\{(7), (6,1), (5,2), (4,3)\\}$. We need the character values of $S_7$ for these representations on the classes (4,3) and (5,2).\n\n    | $\\lambda$ | $l(\\lambda)$ | $\\chi^\\lambda_{(4,3)}$ | $\\chi^\\lambda_{(5,2)}$ | Term in Sum |\n    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n    | (7) | 1 | 1 | 1 | $\\binom{7-1}{2-1} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\binom{6}{1} \\cdot 1 = 6$ |\n    | (6,1) | 2 | 0 | -1 | $\\binom{7-2}{2-2} \\cdot 0 \\cdot (-1) = \\binom{5}{0} \\cdot 0 = 0$ |\n    | (5,2) | 2 | -1 | 1 | $\\binom{7-2}{2-2} \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 1 = \\binom{5}{0} \\cdot (-1) = -1$ |\n    | (4,3) | 2 | 2 | -1 | $\\binom{7-2}{2-2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-1) = \\binom{5}{0} \\cdot (-2) = -2$ |\n\n3.  **Calculate the sum:**\n    Sum = $6 + 0 + (-1) + (-2) = 3$.\n\n4.  **Final Result:**\n    $H = (\\text{pre-factor}) \\times (\\text{sum}) = 42 \\times 3 = 126$.\n\nThe Hurwitz number is 126. This counts the number of non-isomorphic covers with the specified ordered branch points.\n\n<<<126>>>"
