    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and oligomeric state (number of helices) of a coiled-coil are primarily determined by the packing of amino acid side chains at the core positions, which are the `a` and `d` positions. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues.\n\n2.  **Assign Heptad Positions to the Sequence:** The key to analyzing the sequence is to correctly identify which residues fall into the `a` and `d` positions. We look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues. In an alpha-helix, the `a` and `d` positions are separated by two residues (i.e., `a` is at position `i`, `b` at `i+1`, `c` at `i+2`, and `d` at `i+3`).\n    Let's examine the given sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n    The hydrophobic residues are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W).\n    Let's test possible assignments for the `a` and `d` positions:\n    *   Hypothesis: Let's assume the Alanine at position 4 (A4) is an `a` position.\n    *   If A4 is `a`, then the `d` position would be at 4 + 3 = 7. The residue at position 7 is Leucine (L7). This is a hydrophobic residue, so this assignment is plausible.\n    *   Let's check if this pattern continues throughout the sequence. The next `a` position would be at 4 + 7 = 11. The residue at position 11 is Alanine (A11). The next `d` position would be at 7 + 7 = 14. The residue at position 14 is Leucine (L14). This pattern holds.\n    *   Let's list all `a` and `d` positions based on this assignment:\n        *   **`a` positions:** A(4), A(11), A(18), A(25). All are Alanine.\n        *   **`d` positions:** L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28). All are Leucine.\n    *   This assignment reveals a highly regular and consistent hydrophobic core, strongly suggesting it is the correct one. The sequence consists of four complete heptads with this core pattern, flanked by a few residues at the start and end.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Core Residues for \"Knobs-into-Holes\" Packing and Oligomeric State:** The identity of the residues at the `a` and `d` positions dictates the oligomeric state due to packing efficiency (\"knobs-into-holes\" model).\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically formed when both `a` and `d` positions are occupied by large, bulky hydrophobic residues like Leucine or Isoleucine.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Often has a mixture of large and small hydrophobic residues. A common pattern is a large residue (like Ile or Leu) at the `a` position and a smaller one (like Ala or Val) or a beta-branched one (Ile, Val) at the `d` position.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** A very common and stable pattern for tetramers is having a small hydrophobic residue at the `a` position and a large hydrophobic residue at the `d` position.\n    *   **Pentamers and higher:** Often require more complex patterns, sometimes involving polar residues in the core to form hydrogen-bonding networks.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles to the Identified Pattern:**\n    *   Our sequence has **Alanine (a small residue) at all `a` positions**.\n    *   Our sequence has **Leucine (a large residue) at all `d` positions**.\n    *   This `a=small`/`d=large` pattern is a classic signature for a **tetrameric (4-helix) coiled-coil**. The four small Alanine side chains from the four helices can pack together very tightly in the center of the bundle, creating a stable hydrophobic core. The larger Leucine side chains at the `d` positions then splay out and pack efficiently into the grooves created between the adjacent helices. This specific arrangement provides excellent packing efficiency for a four-helix bundle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the identification of a consistent `(abcdefg)` heptad repeat where the core `a` positions are all Alanine (small) and the `d` positions are all Leucine (large), the principles of knobs-into-holes packing strongly indicate that this sequence will form a **tetramer**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
