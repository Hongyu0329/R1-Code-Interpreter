    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the SKI Combinator Expression\n\nThe given expression is:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\nTo analyze this, we first need to identify and simplify its constituent parts. The fundamental reduction rules for S, K, and I combinators are:\n*   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   `K x y = x`\n*   `I x = x`\n\n### Step 2: Identify Church Numerals and Operations\n\nThe problem states that the expression represents a Church numeral `n`. A Church numeral `c_n` is a function that takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times: `c_n f x = f^n(x)`.\n\nLet's identify the common combinator patterns for Church numerals and their operations within the expression.\n\n1.  **Successor Function (`SUCC`)**: The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is a standard definition of the successor function for Church numerals. If `c_n` is the Church numeral for `n`, then `SUCC c_n` reduces to `c_{n+1}`.\n    *   `SUCC = S(S(K(S))(K))`\n\n2.  **Basic Church Numerals**:\n    *   The combinator `I` is equivalent to the Church numeral `c_1`, because `I f x = f x`, which is one application of `f`.\n    *   Let's evaluate `S(I)(I)`:\n        `S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x) = f^2(x)`. This is the definition of `c_2`.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Sub-expressions**: Now we can simplify the two main arguments within the expression `E`.\n    *   Let `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`. This is `SUCC` applied to `I` (which is `c_1`). So, `A = SUCC(c_1) = c_2`.\n    *   Let `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`. This is `SUCC` applied to `S(I)(I)` (which is `c_2`). So, `B = SUCC(c_2) = c_3`.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Main Expression\n\nSubstituting `c_2` for `A` and `c_3` for `B`, the main expression `E` becomes:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(c_2))))(c_3)`\n\nThis expression has a nested, recursive structure. Let's analyze the `S(I)` combinator.\n`S(I) x y = I y (x y) = y (x y)`\n\nThe expression is of the form `( (S(I) X) Y )`, where function application is left-associative. Let's break down the evaluation from the outside in.\nLet `H_3 = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(c_2))))`.\nThe full expression is `H_3(c_3)`.\n\nLet's define `H_0 = K(c_2)`, `H_1 = S(I)(H_0)`, `H_2 = S(I)(H_1)`, and `H_3 = S(I)(H_2)`. We need to evaluate `H_3(c_3)`.\n\n*   `H_3(c_3) = (S(I) H_2) c_3 = I c_3 (H_2 c_3) = c_3 (H_2 c_3)`\n*   `H_2(c_3) = (S(I) H_1) c_3 = I c_3 (H_1 c_3) = c_3 (H_1 c_3)`\n*   `H_1(c_3) = (S(I) H_0) c_3 = I c_3 (H_0 c_3) = c_3 (H_0 c_3)`\n*   `H_0(c_3) = (K c_2) c_3 = c_2`\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Nested Exponentiations\n\nNow we substitute the results back. The key operation we encounter is the application of one Church numeral to another, like `c_m(c_n)`. This operation corresponds to exponentiation.\n\n**Exponentiation Rule**: In SKI combinator logic, `c_m c_n` (meaning `c_m` applied to `c_n`) is equivalent to the Church numeral `c_{n^m}`.\n*   `c_m c_n f x = (c_n^m f) x = f^{n^m} x`\n\nLet's apply this rule to our backward substitution.\n\n1.  `H_1(c_3) = c_3 (H_0 c_3) = c_3(c_2)`\n    Using the exponentiation rule with `m=3` and `n=2`, `c_3 c_2` represents the Church numeral for `2^3 = 8`.\n    So, `H_1(c_3) = c_8`.\n\n2.  `H_2(c_3) = c_3 (H_1 c_3) = c_3(c_8)`\n    Using the rule with `m=3` and `n=8`, `c_3 c_8` represents the Church numeral for `8^3 = (2^3)^3 = 2^9`.\n    So, `H_2(c_3) = c_{2^9}`.\n\n3.  `H_3(c_3) = c_3 (H_2 c_3) = c_3(c_{2^9})`\n    Using the rule with `m=3` and `n=2^9`, `c_3 c_{2^9}` represents the Church numeral for `(2^9)^3 = 2^{9 \\times 3} = 2^{27}`.\n    So, `H_3(c_3) = c_{2^{27}}`.\n\nThe entire expression `E` evaluates to the Church numeral `c_{2^{27}}`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nThe problem states that the expression is a Church integer `n`. From our analysis, we have found that:\n`n = 2^{27}`\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^{27}) = 27`\n\n<<<27>>>"
