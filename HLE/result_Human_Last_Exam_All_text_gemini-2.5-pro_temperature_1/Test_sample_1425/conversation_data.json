    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z for the given system using path integrals.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function, Z, for a quantum system is defined as the trace of the density matrix in the grand canonical ensemble:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\nwhere:\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   The trace (Tr) is taken over all states in the Fock space.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the Given Hamiltonian**\n\nThe problem specifies the Hamiltonian as $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. We substitute this into the general expression for Z. The operator in the exponent, known as the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{GC}$, becomes:\n$\\hat{H}_{GC} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$\n\nTherefore, the partition function is:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right] = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right]$\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Partition Function as a Path Integral**\n\nThe partition function Z can be expressed as a functional integral over coherent state fields (complex numbers $\\psi$ for bosons, Grassmann numbers $\\psi$ for fermions):\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\nwhere $S[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ is the Euclidean action of the system.\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Euclidean Action**\n\nThe Euclidean action for a general system with a single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ and chemical potential $\\mu$ is given by:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\hat{H}_0 - \\mu) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the imaginary time.\n\nTo find the action for our specific system, we first need to identify the single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$. The total Hamiltonian is given as $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. In second quantization, $\\hat{N} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(x) \\hat{\\psi}(x)$. So, $\\hat{H} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(x) (-\\mu) \\hat{\\psi}(x)$. By comparing this to the general form $\\hat{H} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(x) \\hat{H}_0 \\hat{\\psi}(x)$, we can identify the single-particle Hamiltonian as the constant operator $\\hat{H}_0 = -\\mu$.\n\nNow, we substitute this $\\hat{H}_0 = -\\mu$ into the general action formula:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + (-\\mu) - \\mu) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe path integral we need to solve is:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\exp\\left( -\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi(x, \\tau) \\right)$\n\nThis is a standard Gaussian path integral. The result of such an integral is given by the functional determinant of the operator in the action. The result depends on whether the particles are fermions or bosons.\n\n$Z = \\left[ \\det(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\right]^\\eta$\nwhere:\n*   $\\eta = +1$ for fermions (since the fields are Grassmann variables).\n*   $\\eta = -1$ for bosons (since the fields are complex variables).\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Determinant for Fermions and Bosons**\n\nThe logarithm of the partition function is given by $\\ln Z = \\eta \\text{Tr}[\\ln(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)]$. The trace is evaluated by summing over all single-particle states (e.g., momentum modes $k$) and all Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n$.\n$\\ln Z = \\eta \\sum_k \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$\n\nThe sum over Matsubara frequencies is a standard result from thermal field theory. Let's analyze the cases for fermions and bosons separately.\n\n*   **Case 1: Fermions ($\\eta = +1$)**\n    The Matsubara frequencies are $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$. The summation yields:\n    $\\ln Z_F = \\sum_k \\ln\\left(1 + e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}\\right)$\n    $\\ln Z_F = \\sum_k \\ln\\left(1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)$\n    Since the energy term is independent of the mode index $k$, if the system has $M$ independent single-particle modes (states), the sum becomes a simple multiplication by $M$:\n    $\\ln Z_F = M \\ln\\left(1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)$\n    Exponentiating both sides gives the partition function:\n    $Z_F = \\left(1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)^M$\n\n*   **Case 2: Bosons ($\\eta = -1$)**\n    The Matsubara frequencies are $\\omega_n = 2n\\pi/\\beta$. The summation yields:\n    $\\ln Z_B = - \\sum_k \\left[-\\ln\\left(1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}\\right)\\right]$\n    $\\ln Z_B = \\sum_k \\ln\\left(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)^{-1} = -\\sum_k \\ln\\left(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)$\n    This series converges only if $|e^{2\\beta\\mu}| < 1$, which implies $2\\beta\\mu < 0$, or $\\mu < 0$. This is a necessary condition for a system of bosons with constant energy levels.\n    Assuming $\\mu < 0$, for a system with $M$ modes:\n    $\\ln Z_B = -M \\ln\\left(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)$\n    Exponentiating both sides gives the partition function:\n    $Z_B = \\left(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)^{-M} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)^M}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe question does not specify whether the particles are fermions or bosons, so we provide the answer for both cases. Let $M$ be the total number of single-particle states in the system.\n\nFor a system of **fermions**:\n$Z_F = \\left(1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)^M$\n\nFor a system of **bosons** (with the condition $\\mu < 0$):\n$Z_B = \\left(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}\\right)^{-M}$\n\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n<<<For fermions, the partition function is $Z_F = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^M$. For bosons, it is $Z_B = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$, where $M$ is the number of single-particle modes and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.>>>"
