    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Wavefunction\nThe problem deals with a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well (a \"1D box\") of length 'a'. The box extends from x = 0 to x = a.\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem specifies the quantum state n = 2. So, the wavefunction for this state is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Probability Calculation\nThe probability of finding the particle in a specific interval [x₁, x₂] is calculated by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\nThe probability density for n=2 is:\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (√(2/a) * sin(2πx / a))² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)\n\nThe interval of interest is from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a.\nThe probability, P, is given by the definite integral:\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Integral\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric power-reduction identity: sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2.\nIn our case, θ = 2πx / a, so 2θ = 4πx / a.\nSubstituting this into the integral:\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [ (1 - cos(4πx / a)) / 2 ] dx\nP = (1/a) ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx\n\nNow, we perform the integration:\n∫ (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx = x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Definite Integral\nWe evaluate the result from the limits x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a.\nP = (1/a) * [ (x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)) ] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\nP = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a / 4π) * sin(4π(0.505a) / a)] - [0.495a - (a / 4π) * sin(4π(0.495a) / a)] }\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\nP = (1/a) * { (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a / 4π) * [sin(4π * 0.505) - sin(4π * 0.495)] }\nP = (1/a) * { 0.01a - (a / 4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }\nP = 0.01 - (1 / 4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the Trigonometric Terms\nWe use the identities sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ) and sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ).\nsin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstituting these back into the probability expression:\nP = 0.01 - (1 / 4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1 / 4π) * [2 * sin(0.02π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1 / 2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Numerical Value\nNow we compute the numerical value of this expression. We must use radians for the argument of the sine function.\n*   2π ≈ 6.283185\n*   0.02π ≈ 0.06283185\n*   sin(0.02π) ≈ 0.06282322\n*   1 / (2π) ≈ 1 / 6.283185 ≈ 0.159155\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula for P:\nP ≈ 0.01 - (0.159155) * (0.06282322)\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.0099986267\nP ≈ 0.0000013733\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Correct Wavefunction:** Ensure you use the correct wavefunction for the given quantum number (n=2).\n2.  **Probability Density:** The probability is based on the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, |ψ|².\n3.  **Integration Limits:** The limits of integration must correspond exactly to the given interval [0.495a, 0.505a].\n4.  **Approximation:** The interval is very small (width = 0.01a). One might be tempted to use the approximation P ≈ |ψ₂(x_c)|² * Δx. However, the interval is centered at x = 0.5a, which is a node for the n=2 state (sin(2π(0.5a)/a) = sin(π) = 0). This would incorrectly give a probability of 0. The probability density function is quadratic near the node, so this simple approximation fails. Direct integration is necessary.\n5.  **Numerical Precision:** The final calculation involves subtracting two very nearly equal numbers (0.01 and ~0.0099986). This is known as catastrophic cancellation and requires high precision to obtain an accurate result. Using a calculator is essential.\n6.  **Radians vs. Degrees:** All trigonometric calculations in physics formulas like this must be performed in radians.\n\nThe final calculated probability is approximately 1.373 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<1.373e-6>>>"
