    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Group:** A wallpaper group is one of the 17 possible mathematical groups that describe a two-dimensional repeating pattern, based on its symmetries (translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections).\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, the associated point group is the set of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. It is obtained by ignoring the translational components of the symmetries.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements (i.e., symmetry operations) it contains.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Point Groups of Order 2**\n\nWe need to find which of the 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups have exactly two symmetry operations (one of which is always the identity).\n\nThe 10 crystallographic point groups are:\n1.  **$C_1$ (or 1):** Order 1 (Identity only).\n2.  **$C_2$ (or 2):** Order 2 (Identity, 180째 rotation).\n3.  **$C_3$ (or 3):** Order 3.\n4.  **$C_4$ (or 4):** Order 4.\n5.  **$C_6$ (or 6):** Order 6.\n6.  **$D_1$ (or m):** Order 2 (Identity, one reflection).\n7.  **$D_2$ (or 2mm):** Order 4.\n8.  **$D_3$ (or 3m):** Order 6.\n9.  **$D_4$ (or 4mm):** Order 8.\n10. **$D_6$ (or 6mm):** Order 12.\n\nFrom this list, the point groups with an order of 2 are **$C_2$** and **$D_1$** (also known as **m**).\n\n**Step 3: Find Wallpaper Groups Associated with $C_2$ and $D_1$**\n\nNow we must identify which of the 17 wallpaper groups have $C_2$ or $D_1$ as their point group.\n\n**A. Wallpaper Groups with Point Group $C_2$ (or 2):**\nThese groups have a 180째 rotation as their highest order rotational symmetry and no reflection symmetries.\n\n1.  **p2:** This group is defined by 180째 rotational symmetry centers. Its point group is $C_2$.\n2.  **pgg (p2gg):** This group is defined by two perpendicular glide reflection axes. The composition of two perpendicular glide reflections results in a 180째 rotation. Therefore, its point group is $C_2$.\n\nThere are **2** wallpaper groups with point group $C_2$.\n\n**B. Wallpaper Groups with Point Group $D_1$ (or m):**\nThese groups have reflection as a symmetry, but no rotational symmetry higher than the identity (1-fold). The point group consists of the identity and a single reflection.\n\n1.  **pm:** This group has parallel reflection axes. Its point group is $D_1$.\n2.  **pg:** This group has parallel glide reflection axes. The point group ignores the translational component of the glide, leaving only a reflection. Its point group is $D_1$.\n3.  **cm:** This group has parallel reflection axes on a centered lattice. Its point group is $D_1$.\n\nThere are **3** wallpaper groups with point group $D_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Count**\n\nTo find the total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we add the counts from Step 3.\n\n*   Number of groups with point group $C_2$: 2\n*   Number of groups with point group $D_1$: 3\n\nTotal = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe five wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2 are p2, pgg, pm, pg, and cm. Therefore, there are a total of 5 such groups.\n\n<<<5>>>"
