    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific character in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying detail is a very particular sentiment: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This points to a character who is not only homesick but also reflects on the psychological implications of that homesickness.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and their Motivations**\nLet's consider each character from the answer choices in the context of the film:\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** He is the protagonist who has just arrived at the space station from Earth. The film's long opening sequence is dedicated to establishing his deep connection to Earth's nature (the dacha, the rain, the trees). While he is certainly nostalgic, he has only just begun his ordeal. The feeling of being \"ashamed\" after a long period of missing Earth is less likely to be his primary sentiment at this stage.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his deceased wife, created by the Solaris ocean. She has no genuine memories of Earth herself. Her existence and consciousness are entirely confined to the station and her interactions with Kris. Therefore, she could not miss something she has never truly experienced.\n*   **C. Snaut:** He is one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is world-weary, cynical, and highly philosophical. Having been isolated in space for a long time, he has had ample opportunity to reflect on humanity's purpose and the psychological toll of being so far from home. A poignant, reflective line about the shame of homesickness fits his character's role as the film's philosophical commentator.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** He is the other surviving scientist. Sartorius is portrayed as cold, pragmatic, and almost obsessively dedicated to the scientific mission. He views emotions and sentimentality as distractions from his work. It would be highly out of character for him to admit to, let alone analyze, a feeling like being ashamed of missing rustling leaves.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** He is the scientist who commits suicide before Kris's arrival. We only encounter him through his final, desperate video message. His state of mind is one of despair and warning, not a philosophical reflection on the nature of homesickness.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Dialogue**\nThe line in question is part of a key monologue delivered in the film. The character explains the paradox of space exploration: that humanity seeks to find new worlds but only truly wants to replicate Earth. He says:\n\n\"We are in the foolish position of a man who, striving for a goal, has forgotten it... We are only human in the sense that we are 'homesick'. And we are ashamed to be homesick. We are ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling.\"\n\nThis monologue is spoken by Dr. Snaut to Kris Kelvin. He is explaining the deep psychological malaise that has afflicted the station's crew after their long isolation. The shame comes from their perceived duty as stoic scientists and explorers, a role that they feel shouldn't allow for such \"earthly\" sentimentality.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the character analysis and the specific dialogue from the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. He articulates the profound and suppressed homesickness felt by those who have been long separated from their home world.\n\n<<<C>>>"
