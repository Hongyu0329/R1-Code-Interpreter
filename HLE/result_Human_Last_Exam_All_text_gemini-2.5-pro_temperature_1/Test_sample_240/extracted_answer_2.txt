The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance when tested with a VNA and a loop probe is due to its built-in protective and control circuitry. Most coils have active decoupling circuits (e.g., using PIN diodes) that detune the coil to protect it during the scanner's high-power transmit pulse. When the coil is on a bench and unpowered, this decoupling circuit is often in a default "safe" state, meaning the coil is intentionally non-resonant. Other major factors include: the coil's preamplifier being unpowered and thus damping the resonance; a geometric misalignment between the probe and coil magnetic fields preventing coupling; and the presence of advanced decoupling networks in phased-array coils that isolate the coil elements from external influences, including the test probe.
