    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\n*   **\"Academy Award for Best Picture winner\":** We must only consider films that have won this specific award.\n*   **\"first\":** The answer must be the earliest film on the chronological list of winners that meets the criteria.\n*   **\"depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen\":** The film must contain a visual of one of the two Luxor Obelisks.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their locations.**\nThere are two famous obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt. To answer the question, a film would need to show one of them.\n1.  One obelisk remains at the entrance to the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n2.  The other obelisk was transported to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\n\nTherefore, we need to search for the first Best Picture winner that features scenes shot or set in either Luxor, Egypt (at the temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically review the Best Picture winners.**\nWe will go through the winners year by year, checking their settings to see if they could plausibly feature one of the obelisks.\n\n*   **1927/28 - 1936:** Winners like *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Cimarron*, and *Grand Hotel* are set in places like the WWI front, Oklahoma, and Berlin. None are set in Paris or Luxor.\n*   **1937 - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This film is set in Paris, France. It is a potential candidate. However, the film's key public scenes, like the degradation of Captain Dreyfus, took place in the courtyard of the Ã‰cole Militaire, not the Place de la Concorde. While it might contain stock footage of Paris, there is no prominent or confirmed scene featuring the obelisk.\n*   **1938 - 1942:** Winners like *You Can't Take It with You* (New York), *Gone with the Wind* (American South), *Rebecca* (England), *How Green Was My Valley* (Wales), and *Mrs. Miniver* (England) do not have the correct setting.\n*   **1943 - *Casablanca***: The film is primarily set in Casablanca, Morocco. However, its famous opening montage traces the refugee route from occupied Paris to Casablanca. During this sequence, there is a clear shot of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, with the Luxor Obelisk plainly visible**. This makes *Casablanca* a confirmed candidate.\n*   **Post-1943 Winners:** Since we have a confirmed candidate from 1943, we only need to check if any earlier film also fits. As established, *The Life of Emile Zola* is the only possibility, but a depiction is not confirmed or central to the film. Later films set in Paris, like *An American in Paris* (1951) and *Gigi* (1958), or films set in Egypt, like *Ben-Hur* (1959), also feature relevant locations but came after *Casablanca*.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the findings.**\nBased on the chronological review, *Casablanca*, the winner for 1943, is the first film on the list of Best Picture winners to have a confirmed on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk (the one in Paris).\n\n<<<Casablanca>>>"
