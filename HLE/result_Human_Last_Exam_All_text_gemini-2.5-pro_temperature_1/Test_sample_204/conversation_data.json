    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe given vector field is `n = (nx, ny, nz)`, where:\n`f = atan2(y, x)`\n`r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z*z)`\n`G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n`nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis vector `n` is a unit vector (`nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = 1`) for all points `(x, y, z)` in 3D space. Thus, it defines a map from R³ to the 2-sphere S².\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant that classifies such maps. For the charge to be well-defined, the map must approach a constant value at infinity. Let's check this condition:\nAs `(x,y,z) -> infinity`, `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` or `|z|` goes to infinity.\nThis implies `r2 -> infinity`.\nThen `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) -> PI * 0 = 0`.\nSo, `n` approaches `(sin(0)cos(f), sin(0)sin(f), cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)`.\nSince the field is constant at infinity, we can consider R³ as being compactified to S³, and the map is topologically a map from S³ to S².\n\n### Step 2: Method of Calculation - Linking Number of Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` can be calculated as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere S².\n`H = Lk(n⁻¹(p₁), n⁻¹(p₂))`\nLet's choose two convenient points on S²:\n1.  The South Pole: `p₁ = (0, 0, -1)`\n2.  A point on the equator: `p₂ = (1, 0, 0)`\n\n### Step 3: Find the Preimage of the South Pole `p₁`\n\nThe preimage of `p₁ = (0, 0, -1)` is the set of points `(x, y, z)` where `n(x, y, z) = (0, 0, -1)`.\n`nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 0`\n`ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 0`\n`nz = cos(G) = -1`\n\nFrom `cos(G) = -1`, we get `G = (2k + 1)π` for an integer `k`.\nFrom the definition `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, we know that `0 < G <= π`.\nThe only possibility is `G = π` (for `k=0`).\n`π = π * exp(-10 * r2)` => `exp(-10 * r2) = 1` => `-10 * r2 = 0` => `r2 = 0`.\nFrom the definition of `r2`:\n`r2 = sqrt((x² + y² - 0.5)² + z²) = 0`\nThis requires both terms under the square root to be zero:\n1.  `z = 0`\n2.  `(x² + y² - 0.5)² = 0` => `x² + y² = 0.5`\n\nSo, the preimage of the South Pole is a circle in the `z=0` plane (the xy-plane) with radius `r = sqrt(0.5) = 1/√2`, centered at the origin. Let's call this circle `C₁`.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Preimage of the Equatorial Point `p₂`\n\nThe preimage of `p₂ = (1, 0, 0)` is the set of points `(x, y, z)` where `n(x, y, z) = (1, 0, 0)`.\n`nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1`\n`ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 0`\n`nz = cos(G) = 0`\n\nFrom `cos(G) = 0`, we get `G = π/2 + kπ`. Since `0 < G <= π`, the only possibility is `G = π/2`.\n`π/2 = π * exp(-10 * r2)` => `exp(-10 * r2) = 1/2` => `-10 * r2 = ln(1/2) = -ln(2)` => `r2 = ln(2) / 10`.\n\nFrom `sin(G)sin(f) = 0` and `G=π/2`, we have `sin(π/2)sin(f) = 0` => `sin(f) = 0`.\nFrom `sin(G)cos(f) = 1` and `G=π/2`, we have `sin(π/2)cos(f) = 1` => `cos(f) = 1`.\n`sin(f)=0` and `cos(f)=1` implies `f = 2kπ`.\nFrom `f = atan2(y, x)`, this means `y = 0` and `x > 0`.\n\nNow we use the condition on `r2`:\n`r2² = (ln(2)/10)²`\n`(x² + y² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`\nSubstituting `y=0`:\n`(x² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`\n\nSo, the preimage of `(1, 0, 0)` is a closed loop in the `y=0` plane (the xz-plane), restricted to `x>0`. Let's call this loop `C₂`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Linking Number `Lk(C₁, C₂)`\n\n*   `C₁` is a circle in the `xy`-plane.\n*   `C₂` is a loop in the `xz`-plane.\n*   The two curves lie in orthogonal planes.\n\nThe circle `C₁` pierces the `xz`-plane (the plane containing `C₂`) when `y=0`.\n`x² + 0² = 0.5` => `x = ±1/√2`.\nThe intersection points are `P = (1/√2, 0, 0)` and `Q = (-1/√2, 0, 0)`.\n\nThe loop `C₂` is restricted to `x>0`, so it cannot enclose the point `Q`. Let's check if it encloses `P`. The loop `C₂` is defined by `(x² - 0.5)² + z² = R²` where `R=ln(2)/10`.\nThe x-coordinates on the loop `C₂` range from `x_min = sqrt(0.5 - R)` to `x_max = sqrt(0.5 + R)`.\nThe x-coordinate of point `P` is `x_P = 1/√2 = sqrt(0.5)`.\nSince `R > 0`, we have `sqrt(0.5 - R) < sqrt(0.5) < sqrt(0.5 + R)`.\nThus, the point `P` lies on the x-axis segment enclosed by the loop `C₂`. This means the circle `C₁` passes through the loop `C₂` exactly once.\nTherefore, the magnitude of the linking number is `|Lk(C₁, C₂)| = 1`.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Sign of the Linking Number\n\nThe sign of the linking number depends on the orientation of the two curves. The orientation is induced by the map.\n1.  **Orientation of `C₁`**: The circle `C₁` is parametrized by the angle `f = atan2(y,x)`. The standard orientation is for `f` to increase from 0 to 2π, which is a counter-clockwise (CCW) traversal in the `xy`-plane. At the intersection point `P=(1/√2, 0, 0)`, the tangent vector to `C₁` points in the `+y` direction.\n\n2.  **Orientation of `C₂`**: The tangent vector `T` to `C₂` is given by the cross product of the gradients of the functions defining the curve, `T ∝ grad(f) × grad(G)`.\n    *   `grad(f)` points in the azimuthal direction (`+e_y` at `y=0`).\n    *   `grad(G) = (dG/dr₂) * grad(r₂)`. Since `G = π * exp(-10r₂)`, `dG/dr₂ = -10π * exp(-10r₂)` is negative.\n    *   Therefore, `T` is oriented opposite to `grad(f) × grad(r₂)`. `T ∝ - (grad(f) × grad(r₂))`.\n    *   The vector `grad(r₂)` is the outward normal to the loop `C₂` within the `xz`-plane. The direction `grad(f) × grad(r₂)` (i.e., `e_y × n_outward`) corresponds to a clockwise (CW) traversal.\n    *   Since `T` has an extra negative sign, the orientation of `C₂` is counter-clockwise (CCW) in the `xz`-plane (when viewed from `y>0`).\n\n3.  **Sign Calculation**: The linking number `Lk(C₁, C₂)` is given by the sign of the dot product of the tangent vector of `C₁` at the intersection point and the normal vector of the surface bounded by `C₂`.\n    *   Tangent to `C₁` at `P`: `v₁ = (0, 1, 0)`.\n    *   `C₂` is a CCW loop in the `xz`-plane. By the right-hand rule, the normal to the surface it bounds points in the `+y` direction: `n₂ = (0, 1, 0)`.\n    *   `Lk(C₁, C₂) = sign(v₁ ⋅ n₂) = sign((0, 1, 0) ⋅ (0, 1, 0)) = sign(1) = +1`.\n\nThe Hopf charge is `+1`."
