    "An analysis of the question is performed step-by-step to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Generalized Pair Correlation Function:** In the context of nuclear systems (like a reactor core), this function describes the correlation in the fluctuations of the neutron population at two different points in space and time. Let the neutron density at position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ be $N(\\vec{r}, t)$. The fluctuation from the mean density is $\\delta N(\\vec{r}, t) = N(\\vec{r}, t) - \\langle N(\\vec{r}, t) \\rangle$. The generalized pair correlation function is the covariance between fluctuations at two space-time points:\n        $C(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2) = \\langle \\delta N(\\vec{r}_1, t_1) \\delta N(\\vec{r}_2, t_2) \\rangle$\n        where $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes an ensemble average.\n\n    *   **Space-Time, Double Fourier Transform:** This is a mathematical operation that transforms the function from the real space-time domain $(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2)$ to the frequency-wavevector domain $(\\vec{k}_1, \\omega_1; \\vec{k}_2, \\omega_2)$. The transform takes the general form:\n        $S(\\vec{k}_1, \\omega_1; \\vec{k}_2, \\omega_2) = \\mathcal{F}_{\\vec{r}_1, t_1} \\mathcal{F}^*_{\\vec{r}_2, t_2} [C(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2)]$\n        where $\\mathcal{F}$ is the Fourier transform operator.\n\n2.  **Apply Physical Assumptions Common in Nuclear Criticality:**\n    *   **Stationarity:** It is almost always assumed that the underlying random processes in a reactor operating at a steady state are stationary. This means the correlation between two points in time depends only on the time difference, $\\tau = t_1 - t_2$, and not on the absolute times.\n        $C(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2) = C(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2, \\tau)$\n    *   **Impact of Stationarity:** When the Fourier transform with respect to time is performed on a function of $\\tau$, the result contains a Dirac delta function, $\\delta(\\omega_1 - \\omega_2)$. This means that for a stationary process, there are no correlations between different frequency components. The spectral function is non-zero only when $\\omega_1 = \\omega_2 = \\omega$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Resulting Function (The Name):**\n    *   The **Wiener-Khinchin theorem** is the fundamental principle that connects correlation functions to power spectra. The theorem states that the power spectral density of a random process is the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function.\n    *   This theorem is generalized to two different processes or signals. The Fourier transform of the **cross-correlation** function between two signals yields the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**.\n    *   In our case, the pair correlation function is a cross-correlation between the neutron density fluctuations at two different points, $\\vec{r}_1$ and $\\vec{r}_2$.\n    *   Therefore, the temporal Fourier transform of $C(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2, \\tau)$ gives the Cross-Power Spectral Density as a function of frequency $\\omega$ and the two spatial positions, $P(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2, \\omega)$.\n    *   $P(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} C(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2, \\tau) e^{-i\\omega\\tau} d\\tau$\n    *   This function, the CPSD, is a central quantity in nuclear reactor noise analysis. If $\\vec{r}_1 = \\vec{r}_2$, it becomes the **Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD)**.\n    *   The question also specifies a spatial Fourier transform. Performing a Fourier transform on the spatial variables $(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2)$ moves the CPSD into the wavevector $(\\vec{k})$ domain. The resulting function, $P(\\vec{k}_1, \\vec{k}_2, \\omega)$, is the CPSD in k-space. While this is a theoretical quantity useful for analysis, it does not have a separate common name. It is still referred to as a Cross-Power Spectral Density, specified as being in the wavevector domain.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  The question asks for the name of the *resulting function* after the transform, not a description of the mathematical process.\n2.  The term \"pair correlation\" implies a relationship between two distinct points, leading to a \"cross-\" spectrum rather than an \"auto-\" spectrum.\n3.  The assumption of stationarity is implicit in almost all discussions of power spectra in this field and is key to simplifying the problem to a function of a single frequency.\n4.  The fundamental name for the Fourier transform of a correlation function is a Power Spectral Density. The specific name depends on whether it's an autocorrelation (Auto-PSD) or a cross-correlation (Cross-PSD).\n5.  The addition of the spatial Fourier transform changes the domain of the function (from real space to k-space) but does not change its fundamental name or physical meaning as a measure of correlated power.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is the measure of how the correlated power between two points is distributed in frequency and wavevector space. In the nuclear criticality and reactor noise analysis community, this quantity is most commonly and accurately known as the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**.\n\n<<<Cross-Power Spectral Density>>>"
