**Management Procedures:**
1.  **Immediate:** Medical referral for stabilization of uncontrolled diabetes; wound debridement and irrigation of sockets; prescription of systemic antibiotics and chlorhexidine mouthwash; pain management; and suturing of soft tissues.
2.  **Interim:** Fabrication of an acrylic interim removable partial denture after initial healing to restore aesthetics and maintain space.
3.  **Definitive:** After 4-6 months of healing and confirmation of good glycemic control (HbA1c < 7%), fabrication of a definitive cast metal framework removable partial denture.

**Cells of Interest:**
The key cells are those involved in wound healing, whose function is impaired by diabetes:
*   **Immune cells:** Neutrophils and Macrophages (for infection control).
*   **Regenerative cells:** Fibroblasts (soft tissue), Osteoblasts (bone formation), Osteoclasts (bone remodeling), and Endothelial cells (blood vessel formation).

**Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Denture Type:** Initially, an **interim acrylic removable partial denture**, followed by a **definitive cast metal framework removable partial denture**.
*   **Material:** **Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA)** for the interim denture. A **Cobalt-Chromium alloy framework** with acrylic saddles and teeth for the definitive denture.
*   **Abutment Teeth:** The **left central incisor** and the **left second premolar**.
*   **Reason for Abutments:** They are the teeth adjacent to the edentulous space, providing the necessary support, stability, and retention for the prosthesis. Their own clinical and radiographic health must be verified first.
