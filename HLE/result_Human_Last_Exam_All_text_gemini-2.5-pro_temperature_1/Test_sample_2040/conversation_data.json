    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Material:** \"free-standing boron nanosheets\" (also known as borophene). This specifies the medium for light interaction. \"Free-standing\" is crucial as it implies the absence of a substrate that could influence its properties, particularly its symmetry.\n    *   **Process:** \"excited by incident light\". This is the input energy.\n    *   **Phenomenon:** \"spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)\". This is the specific optical effect we need to evaluate.\n\n2.  **Understand Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):**\n    *   SPDC is a **nonlinear optical process**.\n    *   In this process, one photon of higher energy (the \"pump\" photon, frequency ωₚ) interacts with a nonlinear material and spontaneously splits into two photons of lower energy (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons, frequencies ωₛ and ωᵢ).\n    *   This process must adhere to the laws of conservation of energy (ωₚ = ωₛ + ωᵢ) and momentum (k⃗ₚ = k⃗ₛ + k⃗ᵢ).\n    *   Crucially, SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear effect**. Its efficiency is governed by the material's **second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as χ⁽²⁾**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Requirement for a Second-Order Nonlinear Effect:**\n    *   A fundamental principle in nonlinear optics is that a material can only exhibit a second-order nonlinear response (i.e., have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾) if its crystal structure **lacks a center of inversion symmetry**. Such materials are called **non-centrosymmetric**.\n    *   In a material that possesses inversion symmetry (a **centrosymmetric** material), applying an inversion operation leaves the crystal structure unchanged. However, the electric field vector inverts (E⃗ → -E⃗). The induced second-order polarization P⃗⁽²⁾ is proportional to E⃗². Under inversion, P⃗⁽²⁾ must also invert (P⃗⁽²⁾ → -P⃗⁽²⁾) due to the material's symmetry. But the driving term is unchanged: E⃗² → (-E⃗)² = E⃗². The only way for the relationship P⃗⁽²⁾ ∝ E⃗² to be consistent with the symmetry requirement P⃗⁽²⁾(-E⃗) = -P⃗⁽²⁾(E⃗) is if the proportionality constant, χ⁽²⁾, is identically zero.\n    *   Therefore, the core of the question becomes: **Is the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric?**\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structure of Boron Nanosheets:**\n    *   Unlike graphene, which has a single, stable honeycomb structure, boron nanosheets (borophene) can exist in several different structural forms, known as polymorphs.\n    *   The most commonly studied and predicted stable forms of *free-standing* borophene are the **β₁₂** and **χ₃** phases.\n    *   Both the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases of borophene belong to the orthorhombic crystal system, and their space group is **Pmmn**.\n    *   A key feature of the Pmmn space group (No. 59) is that it **possesses a center of inversion symmetry**. Therefore, these common, stable forms of free-standing borophene are **centrosymmetric**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that requires a non-centrosymmetric material (χ⁽²⁾ ≠ 0).\n    *   The stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n    *   In centrosymmetric materials, χ⁽²⁾ is zero by symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, the primary mechanism for SPDC is absent in ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** This analysis applies to the ideal, perfect crystal structure. In a real sample, defects, strain, or finite size (edges) can locally break the inversion symmetry. This could, in principle, allow for a very weak, localized SPDC signal. However, this is not an intrinsic property of the bulk material, and the effect would be negligible compared to that in an intrinsically non-centrosymmetric material. The question asks what would be \"expected\", which points to the intrinsic, dominant behavior.\n2.  **Higher-Order Effects:** While the dominant electric-dipole contribution to χ⁽²⁾ is zero, extremely weak second-order effects can arise from higher-order multipole interactions (like electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole). These are typically many orders of magnitude smaller and are not what is generally meant when discussing SPDC.\n3.  **Other Polymorphs:** While β₁₂ and χ₃ are the most cited stable free-standing forms, it is theoretically possible for other, less stable, non-centrosymmetric polymorphs to exist. However, based on the current understanding of the material, the expectation for a generic \"boron nanosheet\" is based on its most stable forms.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, because the stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, they have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾ = 0). Since SPDC is a second-order process dependent on χ⁽²⁾, it is forbidden by symmetry in this material.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is because the most stable, commonly studied phases of borophene possess a crystal structure with inversion symmetry (they are centrosymmetric). Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that is forbidden by symmetry in centrosymmetric materials.>>>"
