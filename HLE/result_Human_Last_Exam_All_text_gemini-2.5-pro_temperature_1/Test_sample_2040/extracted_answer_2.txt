No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is because the most stable, commonly studied phases of borophene possess a crystal structure with inversion symmetry (they are centrosymmetric). Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process that is forbidden by symmetry in centrosymmetric materials.
