    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final binary pattern.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Cellular Automaton Rule 110**\n\nA one-dimensional cellular automaton consists of a line of cells, each having a state (in this case, 0 or 1). The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by a rule based on its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors (left and right).\n\nRule 110 is named after the binary representation of the number 110, which is `01101110`. This binary string defines the output for the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns, ordered from `111` down to `000`.\n\nHere is the explicit rule table:\n\n| Current Neighborhood (Left, Center, Right) | Next State of Center Cell |\n| :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |\n| `111`                                      | 0                         |\n| `110`                                      | 1                         |\n| `101`                                      | 1                         |\n| `100`                                      | 0                         |\n| `011`                                      | 1                         |\n| `010`                                      | 1                         |\n| `001`                                      | 1                         |\n| `000`                                      | 0                         |\n\n### **Step 2: Setting up the Simulation**\n\n*   **Initial State (Generation 0):** The starting pattern is a single cell in state 1, which we represent as the binary pattern `1`.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** We assume the line of cells is infinite and all cells outside the pattern are in state 0. This is known as a \"quiescent\" background.\n*   **Process:** To compute the next generation, we take the current pattern, add a '0' to both the left and right sides (to account for the influence of the quiescent background on the edges), and then apply Rule 110 to each 3-cell window to generate the new pattern.\n\n### **Step 3: Iterative Application of the Rule**\n\nLet's track the pattern for the first few generations to see how it evolves.\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n*   **Gen 1:** We evaluate the padded pattern `010`.\n    *   Left edge (from `001`): `1`\n    *   Center (from `010`): `1`\n    *   Right edge (from `100`): `0`\n    *   Result: `11`\n*   **Gen 2:** We evaluate the padded pattern `0110`.\n    *   From `001`: `1`\n    *   From `011`: `1`\n    *   From `110`: `1`\n    *   Result: `111`\n*   **Gen 3:** We evaluate `01110`.\n    *   From `001`: `1`\n    *   From `011`: `1`\n    *   From `111`: `0`\n    *   From `110`: `1`\n    *   Result: `1101`\n\nThis process is repeated for 20 generations. Manually calculating all 20 steps is tedious and prone to error. The key is to apply the rule table systematically.\n\n### **Step 4: The Complete 20-Step Simulation**\n\nExecuting the simulation for 20 steps yields the following sequence of patterns:\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n*   **Gen 1:** `11`\n*   **Gen 2:** `111`\n*   **Gen 3:** `1101`\n*   **Gen 4:** `11111`\n*   **Gen 5:** `110001`\n*   **Gen 6:** `1110011`\n*   **Gen 7:** `11010111`\n*   **Gen 8:** `111111101`\n*   **Gen 9:** `1100000111`\n*   **Gen 10:** `11100011001`\n*   **Gen 11:** `110100111011`\n*   **Gen 12:** `1111101101111`\n*   **Gen 13:** `11000111111001`\n*   **Gen 14:** `111001100001011`\n*   **Gen 15:** `1101011100011111`\n*   **Gen 16:** `11111110100110001`\n*   **Gen 17:** `110000011101110011`\n*   **Gen 18:** `111000110111010111`\n*   **Gen 19:** `1101001111101111101`\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation for Generation 20**\n\nTo get the 20th generation, we apply the rules to the padded 19th generation: `011010011111011111010`.\n\nApplying the rule table to each 3-cell window of this padded string gives the final pattern.\n\n*   `001` -> **1**\n*   `011` -> **1**\n*   `110` -> **1**\n*   `101` -> **1**\n*   `010` -> **1**\n*   `100` -> **0**\n*   `001` -> **1**\n*   `011` -> **1**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `110` -> **1**\n*   `101` -> **1**\n*   `011` -> **1**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `110` -> **1**\n*   `101` -> **1**\n*   `010` -> **1**\n\nAssembling these results gives the final binary pattern for the 20th generation.\n\n<<<11111011000111000111>>>"
