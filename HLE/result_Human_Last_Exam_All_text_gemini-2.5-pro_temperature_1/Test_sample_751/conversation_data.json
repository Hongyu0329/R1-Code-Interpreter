    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Duality**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time system described by state-space equations:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwhere:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to reduce this system to the observer canonical form using the principle of duality. Duality states that a system (A, C) is observable if and only if its dual system (A^T, C^T) is controllable. The observer canonical form of a system is the dual of the controller canonical form.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Construct the dual system (A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T).\n2.  Find a state transformation that converts the dual system into controller canonical form (CCF).\n3.  The dual of this transformation will convert the original system into observer canonical form (OCF).\n4.  Calculate the new output matrix C_o for the system in OCF.\n\n**Step 2: Handle the Multi-Output Nature**\n\nThe given system has two outputs (C is a 2x3 matrix), making it a Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) type system from an observability perspective. The dual system will have two inputs (B_d = C^T is 3x2). Canonical forms for multi-input/multi-output systems are complex. A standard approach for such problems is to select a single output (or input for the dual) that makes the system observable (or controllable) and base the transformation on this simpler SISO system.\n\nLet's check observability for each output row of C.\nc1 = [0, 1, 0]\nc2 = [1, 1, 0]\n\nWe will base our transformation on the first output, c1. The system to be made canonical is (A, c1).\n\n**Step 3: Construct and Analyze the Dual System**\n\nThe dual system for (A, c1) is (A_d, b_d):\nA_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nb_d = c1^T = [0, 1, 0]^T\n\nWe need to transform this system to Controller Canonical Form (CCF). First, we find the characteristic polynomial of A_d (which is the same as for A).\np(λ) = det(λI - A_d) = det([[λ-1, -2, 0], [-1, λ-1, -2], [0, -1, λ]])\np(λ) = (λ-1)[λ(λ-1) - 2] - (-2)[-λ]\np(λ) = (λ-1)(λ^2 - λ - 2) - 2λ\np(λ) = λ^3 - λ^2 - 2λ - λ^2 + λ + 2 - 2λ\np(λ) = λ^3 - 2λ^2 - 3λ + 2\n\nLet the characteristic polynomial be p(λ) = λ^3 + a_2λ^2 + a_1λ + a_0.\nSo, a_2 = -2, a_1 = -3, a_0 = 2.\n\n**Step 4: Define the Target Controller Canonical Form**\n\nThere are several forms for CCF. We will use the form whose dual (the OCF) has the output vector c_o = [1, 0, 0].\nThe CCF is (A_c, b_c):\nA_c = [[-a_2, -a_1, -a_0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]] = [[2, 3, -2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]\nb_c = [1, 0, 0]^T\n\nThe corresponding OCF is (A_o, c_o):\nA_o = A_c^T = [[2, 1, 0], [3, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 0]]\nc_o = b_c^T = [1, 0, 0]\n\n**Step 5: Find the Transformation Matrix for the Dual System**\n\nLet P be the transformation matrix such that z = P * z_c, where z is the state of the dual system and z_c is the state in CCF. P relates the two systems as:\nA_d * P = P * A_c\nb_d = P * b_c\n\nFrom b_d = P * b_c = [p1 p2 p3] * [1, 0, 0]^T, we get p1 = b_d.\np1 = [0, 1, 0]^T\n\nFrom A_d * P = P * A_c, we expand column by column:\nA_d * p1 = 2*p1 + p2  => p2 = (A_d - 2I) * p1\nA_d * p2 = 3*p1 + p3  => p3 = A_d * p2 - 3*p1\n\nCalculate p2:\np2 = ([[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] - [[2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2]]) * [0, 1, 0]^T\np2 = [[-1, 2, 0], [1, -1, 2], [0, 1, -2]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, -1, 1]^T\n\nCalculate p3:\nA_d * p2 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [2, -1, 1]^T = [0, 3, -1]^T\np3 = [0, 3, -1]^T - 3 * [0, 1, 0]^T = [0, 0, -1]^T\n\nSo, the transformation matrix for the dual system is P = [p1 p2 p3]:\nP = [[0, 2, 0], [1, -1, 0], [0, 1, -1]]\n\n**Step 6: Find the Transformation Matrix for the Original System**\n\nThe transformation matrix P_o that converts the original system (A, C) to OCF is the transpose of P:\nP_o = P^T = [[0, 1, 0], [2, -1, 1], [0, 0, -1]]\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the New Output Matrix C_o**\n\nThe new state is x_o = P_o * x, so x = P_o^-1 * x_o.\nThe new output equation is y(k) = C * x(k) = C * (P_o^-1 * x_o(k)).\nThe new output matrix is C_o = C * P_o^-1.\n\nWe need to find P_o^-1. We know P_o^-1 = (P^T)^-1 = (P^-1)^T. Let's find P^-1 first.\ndet(P) = -1 * det([[0, 2], [1, -1]]) = -1 * (-2) = 2.\nThe adjugate of P is Adj(P) = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, -2]].\nP^-1 = (1/det(P)) * Adj(P) = (1/2) * [[1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, -2]]\n\nNow, find P_o^-1 = (P^-1)^T:\nP_o^-1 = (1/2) * [[1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, -2]] = [[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]\n\nFinally, calculate C_o:\nC_o = C * P_o^-1 = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]\nC_o = [[0*0.5+1*1+0*0, 0*0.5+1*0+0*0, 0*0.5+1*0+0*(-1)],\n       [1*0.5+1*1+0*0, 1*0.5+1*0+0*0, 1*0.5+1*0+0*(-1)]]\nC_o = [[1, 0, 0],\n       [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]]\n\nThe first row of the new C matrix, [1, 0, 0], matches the canonical form c_o = b_c^T, which confirms our calculations are consistent.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]]>>>"
