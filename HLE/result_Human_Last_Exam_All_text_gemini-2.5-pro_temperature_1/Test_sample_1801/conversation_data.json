    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Company:** Enron\n    *   **Campaign:** \"Ask Why\"\n    *   **Year:** 2000\n    *   **People:** Two individuals\n    *   **Key characteristic:** Both are Nobel laureates.\n\n2.  **Understand the Context:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major corporate branding effort by Enron. Its purpose was to shift its public image from a staid energy pipeline company to a cutting-edge, innovative global corporation. The campaign featured various intellectuals and public figures, associating the Enron brand with forward-thinking and questioning the status quo. This context is deeply ironic given the company's subsequent collapse in 2001 due to massive, systemic accounting fraud.\n\n3.  **Identify the Individuals:** Research into this specific advertising campaign is required. The commercials featured several people, so the task is to find the two who were also Nobel laureates in Economics.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Laureate:** One of the prominent figures in the commercials was **Merton Miller**.\n    *   **Verification:** Merton Miller was an American economist.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must check his Nobel Prize status relative to the commercial's air date. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990. Since the commercial was in 2000, he was indeed a Nobel laureate at the time he was featured.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Second Laureate:** The other well-known economist featured in the campaign was **Paul Krugman**.\n    *   **Verification:** Paul Krugman is a prominent American economist and public intellectual.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical detail to get right. We must check the timing of his Nobel Prize. Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. The commercial aired in 2000. Therefore, at the time he appeared in the Enron ad, he was *not yet* a Nobel laureate. However, he is a Nobel laureate now. The question asks for two Nobel laureates who *were featured*, which means the individuals are now identified by that status. Both Miller and Krugman fit the description of being \"Nobel laureates\" who were in the ad.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The two individuals who fit the description are Merton Miller and Paul Krugman. Both are recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, and both were featured in Enron's \"Ask Why\" campaign in 2000. The key nuance is that Miller had already won his prize, while Krugman would win his eight years later.\n\n***\n\nThe two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials were:\n1.  **Merton Miller** (who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990)\n2.  **Paul Krugman** (who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008)\n\n<<<Merton Miller and Paul Krugman>>>"
