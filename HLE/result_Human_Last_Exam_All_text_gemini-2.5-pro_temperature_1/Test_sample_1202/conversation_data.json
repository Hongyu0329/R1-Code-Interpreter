    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts in the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the most likely mechanism that explains two key phenomena following a gene duplication event:\n*   **Retention:** After a gene is duplicated, the genome has two identical copies. Since one copy is usually sufficient, the other is redundant and can be lost (becoming a pseudogene) without any negative effect. \"Retention\" means that both copies are kept as functional genes over evolutionary time.\n*   **Divergence:** The two retained copies do not remain identical. They accumulate different mutations, causing their DNA sequences and, consequently, their functions or expression patterns to become different.\n\nSo, we are looking for a process that not only saves the second gene copy from being lost but also causes the two copies to evolve differently.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a DNA repair mechanism where one sequence of DNA replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, it tends to make the two copies more similar or identical. This process works *against* divergence. Therefore, it is not the mechanism responsible for divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process by which a gene copy becomes non-functional due to the accumulation of harmful mutations. This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene because the second copy is initially redundant and not protected by selective pressure. However, this describes the *loss* of a functional gene, not its **retention**. Therefore, it is the opposite of the process asked for in the question.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one duplicate copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a brand-new, beneficial function. Natural selection will then act to preserve both copies: one for the old, essential function and one for the new, advantageous function. This model successfully explains both **retention** (both genes are beneficial) and **divergence** (the second gene must change to gain a new function).\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) proposes that the original ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple different tissues/times (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that inactivate different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function A but keeps function B, while copy 2 loses function B but keeps function A. Now, both genes are required to perform the full range of the original gene's roles. This \"division of labor\" ensures the **retention** of both copies and leads to their **divergence** as they specialize.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a group of organisms into new forms filling different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for adaptive radiation, it is a population- or species-level phenomenon, not a molecular mechanism for retaining individual genes within a single genome. It operates at the wrong biological scale.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Most Plausible Mechanisms**\n\nWe are left with two strong candidates: Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D). Both are accepted models that explain both retention and divergence. The question asks which is \"most likely\". This requires a judgment on their relative probability.\n\n*   **Probability:** The key difference lies in the types of mutations required.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires a *gain-of-function* mutation, which creates a new beneficial function. Such mutations are considered to be very rare.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization** is driven by *loss-of-function* mutations, which degrade or inactivate part of a gene's function. These mutations are far more common than gain-of-function mutations.\n\n*   **Conclusion on \"Most Likely\":** Because subfunctionalization relies on more frequent mutational events (loss-of-function), it provides a more probable and passive pathway for preserving duplicate genes from being lost to pseudogenization. A duplicate gene doesn't need to \"get lucky\" and invent a new function; it is preserved simply by a complementary pattern of degradation. For this reason, many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization to be a more common, and thus more \"likely,\" mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n\nBased on the analysis, subfunctionalization is the mechanism that most likely accounts for the high frequency of retained duplicate genes because it is driven by common loss-of-function mutations, providing a more probable pathway for retention and divergence compared to the rare gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
