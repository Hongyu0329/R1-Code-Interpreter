    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Technology Used:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture beat-to-beat intervals. PPG measures changes in blood volume in the microvascular bed of tissue. Each peak in the PPG signal corresponds to a heartbeat.\n    *   **Measurements:** The system tracks Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Fundamental Data Point:** The core data captured is the \"beat-to-beat interval\". This is the time that elapses between two consecutive heartbeats (or pulse waves detected by PPG).\n    *   **The Core Question:** The question asks for the specific name of this \"value between heartbeats\" which is used to compute HRV.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Process:**\n    *   A sensor (PPG) detects a series of peaks, each representing a pulse wave from a heartbeat.\n    *   The system's software identifies the exact time of each peak.\n    *   It then calculates the time difference between consecutive peaks. For example, if Peak 1 occurs at time T1 and Peak 2 occurs at time T2, the interval is T2 - T1.\n    *   This results in a sequence of time intervals (e.g., 850 ms, 875 ms, 840 ms, 860 ms...).\n    *   HRV is not one of these individual values but a statistical measure of the *variation* within this sequence of values. For example, metrics like SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals) or RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) are calculated from this list of intervals.\n\n3.  **Identify the Terminology:**\n    *   The time duration between two consecutive heartbeats is the fundamental unit of measurement.\n    *   In the context of ECG (Electrocardiogram), this is famously called the **R-R Interval**, as it's the time between two consecutive \"R\" peaks in the QRS complex.\n    *   In the context of PPG, since there is no R-peak, a more general term is used. The most common and accurate term is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n    *   Another related term is **NN Interval (Normal-to-Normal Interval)**. This is a filtered version of the IBI or R-R interval list, where intervals caused by artifacts or ectopic beats (arrhythmias) have been removed. However, the raw measurement itself is the IBI.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **PPG vs. ECG:** The question specifies PPG. While the underlying physiological event (heartbeat) is the same, the signal source is different. Using \"R-R interval\" might be considered less precise for PPG, whereas \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" is universally applicable.\n*   **HRV vs. the Interval Itself:** It's crucial to distinguish between the *measure of variability* (HRV) and the *individual data points* used to calculate it. The question is asking for the name of the data point, not the final HRV metric (like RMSSD).\n*   **\"Value\" vs. \"Interval\":** The question uses the word \"value\". This refers to the numerical value of the time duration, measured in milliseconds (ms). The name for this specific measurement is the Inter-Beat Interval.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the value computed between heartbeats, which represents the time duration from one beat to the next and is used as the basis for all HRV calculations, is called the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
