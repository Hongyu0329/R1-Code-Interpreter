    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Understand the Terminology\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema (or signature) $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate is a property that an element of the domain can either have or not have. For an element $x$, $P_i(x)$ is either true or false.\n*   **$\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This denotes a fragment of First-Order Logic over the schema $S$.\n    *   $\\mathrm{FO}$: First-Order Logic.\n    *   $S$: The allowed predicates are $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n    *   $\\exists$: Only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$) is allowed. Universal quantifiers ($\\forall$) are not allowed.\n    *   $\\land$: Only the conjunction logical connective ($\\land$, AND) is allowed. Disjunction ($\\lor$) and negation ($\\neg$) are not allowed.\n    *   $\\top, \\bot$: The logical constants for \"true\" and \"false\" are allowed.\n*   **VC Dimension**: The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the expressive power of a set of classifiers (a hypothesis class). In this context, the classifiers are the concepts definable by the logical formulas.\n    *   **Concept**: A formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable defines a concept, which is the set of all elements $a$ in a given structure for which $\\phi(a)$ is true.\n    *   **Shattering**: A set of points $X = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_d\\}$ is said to be shattered by a class of formulas if for every possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a formula $\\phi(x)$ in the class and a structure $\\mathcal{A}$ such that the concept defined by $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathcal{A}$ separates $Y$ from $X \\setminus Y$. That is, for all $x \\in X$, $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi(x)$ if and only if $x \\in Y$.\n    *   **VC Dimension of a Logic**: The VC dimension of the logic is the size $d$ of the largest finite set $X$ that can be shattered. To find this, we need to find the maximum $d$ for which there exists *some* structure $\\mathcal{A}$ where a set of size $d$ is shattered by the formulas of the logic.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Formulas (Classifiers)\n\nThe formulas in our language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with one free variable $x$ are our classifiers. Let's analyze their structure.\nAny such formula $\\phi(x)$ is built from atomic formulas ($P_i(v)$ where $v$ is a variable) using only $\\land$ and $\\exists$.\n\nA general formula $\\phi(x)$ can be written in the form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv L(x) \\land C$\nwhere:\n1.  **$L(x)$** is a conjunction of all atomic formulas that contain the free variable $x$. Since we don't have equality, these are of the form $P_i(x)$. So, $L(x)$ is a conjunction of a subset of the available predicates applied to $x$. For example, $L(x)$ could be $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n2.  **$C$** is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). It's a conjunction of existentially quantified statements, like $\\exists y (P_2(y) \\land P_4(y))$. For any given structure, $C$ is either globally true or globally false.\n\nFor a fixed structure $\\mathcal{A}$, our hypothesis class (the set of definable concepts) is determined by these formulas. A formula $\\phi(x) = L(x) \\land C$ defines a concept. If the sentence $C$ is false in $\\mathcal{A}$, the formula is false for all $x$, defining the empty set concept ($\\emptyset$). If $C$ is true in $\\mathcal{A}$, the formula is equivalent to $L(x)$, and it defines the concept corresponding to $L(x)$.\n\nThe formula $\\top$ is always a true sentence. Therefore, for any local part $L(x)$, the formula $L(x) \\land \\top \\equiv L(x)$ is in our language. This means that for any structure $\\mathcal{A}$, our set of available classifiers always includes all concepts definable by formulas of the form $L(x)$.\n\nThe formulas of type $L(x)$ are conjunctions of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. There are $2^4 = 16$ such index sets, leading to 16 basic formulas (including the empty conjunction, which is $\\top$).\n\n### Step 3: Establish an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nTo shatter a set of $d$ points, we need to be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. This requires at least $2^d$ distinct classifiers.\nIn our case, the set of classifiers is generated by the 16 basic formulas of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. Regardless of the structure, these 16 formulas can define at most 16 distinct concepts.\nTherefore, to shatter a set of size $d$, we must have:\n$2^d \\le 16$\n$d \\le \\log_2(16)$\n$d \\le 4$\n\nThis proves that the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Step 4: Establish a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that it's possible to shatter a set of 4 points. This requires constructing a specific structure (a database instance) on 4 points where all $2^4 = 16$ subsets can be generated by our formulas.\n\nLet's choose a set of 4 points, $X = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. We need to define the truth values of the four predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ for each of these points.\n\nConsider the following structure $\\mathcal{A}$ with universe $X$:\nDefine $P_j(a_i)$ to be true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\nLet's represent this in a table where a `1` means true and a `0` means false:\n\n|        | $P_1$ | $P_2$ | $P_3$ | $P_4$ |\n| :----: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **a₁** |   0   |   1   |   1   |   1   |\n| **a₂** |   1   |   0   |   1   |   1   |\n| **a₃** |   1   |   1   |   0   |   1   |\n| **a₄** |   1   |   1   |   1   |   0   |\n\nNow, we need to show that for any target subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a formula $\\phi(x)$ that selects exactly the elements in $Y$.\nLet $J_Y = \\{j \\mid a_j \\notin Y\\}$ be the set of indices of the points we want to *exclude*.\nConsider the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_Y} P_j(x)$.\n\nLet's check if this formula works:\n1.  **Pick an element $a_i \\in Y$ (an element we want to select).**\n    This means $i \\notin J_Y$. We need to show that $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi_Y(a_i)$.\n    The formula is $\\bigwedge_{j \\in J_Y} P_j(a_i)$. For this to be true, $P_j(a_i)$ must be true for all $j \\in J_Y$.\n    By our construction, $P_j(a_i)$ is true if $i \\neq j$. Since $i \\notin J_Y$, for any $j \\in J_Y$, it is guaranteed that $i \\neq j$.\n    Therefore, $P_j(a_i)$ is true for all $j$ in the conjunction, and $\\phi_Y(a_i)$ is true.\n\n2.  **Pick an element $a_i \\notin Y$ (an element we want to exclude).**\n    This means $i \\in J_Y$. We need to show that $\\mathcal{A} \\not\\models \\phi_Y(a_i)$.\n    The formula is $\\bigwedge_{j \\in J_Y} P_j(a_i)$. For this to be false, we just need one part of the conjunction to be false.\n    Since $i \\in J_Y$, the predicate $P_i(x)$ is part of the conjunction.\n    We need to evaluate $P_i(a_i)$. By our construction, $P_i(a_i)$ is false.\n    Therefore, the conjunction is false, and $\\phi_Y(a_i)$ is false.\n\nThis construction works for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$. For example, to select $Y=\\{a_1, a_3\\}$, the excluded points are $\\{a_2, a_4\\}$, so $J_Y=\\{2,4\\}$. The formula is $\\phi(x) = P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$.\n*   For $a_1$: $P_2(a_1) \\land P_4(a_1)$ is $1 \\land 1 = 1$ (True).\n*   For $a_2$: $P_2(a_2) \\land P_4(a_2)$ is $0 \\land 1 = 0$ (False).\n*   For $a_3$: $P_2(a_3) \\land P_4(a_3)$ is $1 \\land 1 = 1$ (True).\n*   For $a_4$: $P_2(a_4) \\land P_4(a_4)$ is $1 \\land 0 = 0$ (False).\nThe formula correctly selects $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$.\n\nSince we can construct a formula for every one of the $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $X$, the set $X$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\n*   From Step 3, we know the VC dimension is at most 4.\n*   From Step 4, we know the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with a schema $S$ containing 4 unary predicates is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
