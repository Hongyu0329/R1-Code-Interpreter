    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we list the elements known as noble gases. In order of increasing atomic number, they are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Oganesson is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth and was first synthesized after 2002. Therefore, it is excluded from the analysis of naturally occurring \"terrestrial matter\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Measurement \"Percentage of All Terrestrial Matter\"**\nThe question asks for the rarest gas as a percentage of *all* of Earth's matter. This includes the atmosphere, crust, mantle, core, and oceans. The primary reservoir for noble gases on Earth is the atmosphere, so atmospheric concentration is the most important factor and a very good proxy for their overall relative abundance. The ranking of abundance in the atmosphere generally holds for the Earth as a whole. The specified year, 2002, is not a significant factor, as the natural abundances of these elements are stable over such timescales.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundances of Stable Noble Gases**\nLet's examine the abundances of the stable (or very long-lived) noble gases, primarily by looking at their concentration in dry air by volume:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** By far the most common, at approximately 9,340 parts per million (ppm), or 0.934%.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most common, at approximately 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most common, at approximately 5.2 ppm. It is continually produced by radioactive decay in the crust but also continually escapes into space due to its low mass.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Much rarer, at approximately 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the stable noble gases, at approximately 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Among the stable noble gases, Xenon is clearly the rarest. The analysis must now include the final candidate, Radon.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Abundance of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is fundamentally different from the other noble gases on the list because it is highly radioactive.\n*   **Radioactivity and Half-Life:** Radon's most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is formed from the radioactive decay of radium, which is part of the decay chain of uranium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Lack of Accumulation:** Because it decays so quickly, Radon does not accumulate in the atmosphere to any significant, stable concentration. Its presence is fleeting; it is continuously being created and destroyed.\n*   **Concentration:** The atmospheric concentration of Radon is extremely low and highly variable depending on location (e.g., proximity to uranium-bearing rocks). On average, its concentration is estimated to be on the order of 1 part in 10^21 (one part per sextillion), which is millions of times lower than Xenon's concentration.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The key difference is stability. The stable noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) have accumulated over geological time. Radon, due to its short half-life, has not. The total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any single moment is minuscule.\n\n**Step 5: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\nWhen comparing the abundances, we have:\n*   Abundance of Xenon (rarest stable noble gas): ~0.09 parts per million.\n*   Abundance of Radon (radioactive noble gas): ~1 part in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10^21).\n\nIt is clear that Radon's concentration is orders of magnitude lower than Xenon's. Therefore, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon is the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
