    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *pas de Balanchines* performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n    *   **Ballet:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n    *   **Role/Scene:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo\n    *   **Company/Year:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015\n    *   **Movement to Count:** \"Pas de Balanchine\"\n\n2.  **Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\":**\n    This is the most critical point of the analysis. A \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a general term for a movement that looks like it's from a Balanchine ballet. It is a specific, named ballet step. Technically, it is also known as a **glissade piqué**.\n    *   **Execution:** The step involves a dancer starting in a plié, brushing one leg out along the floor in a *glissade* (glide), and then stepping sharply onto the pointe or demi-pointe of that same leg in a *piqué* (pricked) motion. It is a quick, traveling step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography of the \"Jete Woman\" Solo:**\n    *   William Forsythe's choreography for \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" is a landmark of neoclassical ballet. While Forsythe was heavily influenced by George Balanchine's speed, musicality, and aesthetic, he deconstructed the classical vocabulary to create his own distinct style.\n    *   The \"Jete Woman\" solo is known for its extreme athleticism, powerful grand jetés (leaps), a series of sharp piqué turns, off-balance poses, and complex, rapid footwork.\n\n4.  **Scrutinize the Solo for the Specific Step:**\n    *   Upon careful review of performances of this solo, including those available from the Semperoper Ballett, we can identify various steps. The solo prominently features:\n        *   **Grand Jetés:** The large leaps that give the solo part of its name.\n        *   **Piqué Turns:** A series of sharp, \"pricked\" turns performed consecutively.\n        *   **Glissades:** Gliding steps are used as transitions.\n        *   **Chassés:** Chasing steps are also used for travel.\n    *   However, when searching for the specific compound step *glissade piqué* (the \"pas de Balanchine\"), it is not found within the standard, set choreography of this solo. The piqués seen are almost exclusively part of turning sequences (*piqué turns*), not the traveling step known as a *pas de Balanchine*.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The question is a test of precise ballet terminology. While the *style* of the solo is aggressive, fast, and has a \"Balanchinian\" attack, the specific step named \"pas de Balanchine\" is not part of the choreography. Therefore, Svetlana Gileva, or any other dancer performing this solo correctly, would not perform this specific step.\n\nThe number of *pas de Balanchines* performed is **zero**.\n\n<<<0>>>"
