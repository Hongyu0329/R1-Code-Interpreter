    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Context\nThe question is set within the framework of **finite-temperature quantum field theory** for a **neutral scalar field**. We are using the **functional integral representation** of the partition function, which is the cornerstone of the imaginary time (or Matsubara) formalism.\n\n*   **Finite Temperature:** This implies that time is compactified into a circle. We replace real time $t$ with imaginary time $\\tau = it$, where $\\tau$ has a period $\\beta = 1/T$ ($T$ is the temperature, and we set Boltzmann's constant $k_B=1$).\n*   **Neutral Scalar Field:** The field $\\phi(x)$ is real and transforms as a scalar under Lorentz transformations. Its dynamics are described by a Lagrangian.\n*   **Functional Integral:** The partition function $Z$ is calculated by integrating over all possible field configurations, weighted by a factor related to the action of that configuration. $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$.\n*   **Inner Product Notation:** The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ represents an inner product in the space of field configurations.\n\n### Step 2: The Euclidean Action for a Neutral Scalar Field\nFirst, we need the action $S_E[\\phi]$ that appears in the functional integral. We start with the standard Lagrangian in Minkowski spacetime for a scalar field with mass $m$ and a possible self-interaction term (e.g., $\\lambda \\phi^4$):\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial^\\mu \\phi) - \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 - V(\\phi)$\nwhere $V(\\phi)$ represents interaction terms like $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$.\n\nTo move to the finite-temperature formalism, we perform a Wick rotation to Euclidean spacetime: $t \\to -i\\tau$. The Euclidean action $S_E$ is given by:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$\nwhere the Euclidean Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2\\right) + V(\\phi)$\n\n### Step 3: Isolating the Quadratic Part and Defining the Operator $D_\\phi$\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ typically refers to the quadratic part of the action, which corresponds to the free theory (where $V(\\phi)=0$). Let's denote the free part of the action as $S_0[\\phi]$:\n$S_0[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\frac{1}{2}\\left((\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2\\right)$\n\nThe goal is to write this in the form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi)$. The inner product in this context is naturally defined as an integral over Euclidean spacetime:\n$(\\psi_1, \\psi_2) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\psi_1(\\vec{x},\\tau) \\psi_2(\\vec{x},\\tau)$\n\nTo get our action into this form, we need to perform integration by parts on the derivative terms.\n\n### Step 4: Integration by Parts\nLet's apply integration by parts to the $(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2$ and $(\\nabla \\phi)^2$ terms.\n\n1.  **Time derivative:** $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 = \\left[\\phi (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)\\right]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi)$\n2.  **Spatial derivative:** $\\int d^3x \\, (\\nabla \\phi)^2 = \\int d^3x \\, \\nabla \\cdot (\\phi \\nabla\\phi) - \\int d^3x \\, \\phi (\\nabla^2 \\phi)$\n\n### Step 5: Applying Boundary Conditions (Careful Point)\nThe boundary terms from the integration by parts must vanish.\n\n*   **Temporal Boundary:** In the imaginary time formalism for a bosonic field (like our neutral scalar), the field must be periodic in $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$. This means $\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) = \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau+\\beta)$. Consequently, $\\phi(\\vec{x}, 0) = \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\beta)$, and the derivative $\\partial_\\tau\\phi$ must also be periodic. This makes the boundary term $\\left[\\phi (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)\\right]_0^\\beta$ equal to zero.\n*   **Spatial Boundary:** We assume that the fields vanish at spatial infinity, $|\\vec{x}| \\to \\infty$. This is a standard physical requirement. The divergence theorem can be used to show that the spatial boundary term $\\int d^3x \\, \\nabla \\cdot (\\phi \\nabla\\phi)$ vanishes.\n\nWith the boundary terms gone, the free action becomes:\n$S_0[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\left[ \\phi(-\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi) + \\phi(-\\nabla^2 \\phi) + \\phi(m^2\\phi) \\right]$\n$S_0[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x},\\tau) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\vec{x},\\tau)$\n\n### Step 6: Identifying the Inner Product\nNow the free action is precisely in the form $S_0[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi)$.\n\n*   The operator is $D_\\phi = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$. This is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n*   The full inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is the integral expression itself.\n\nTherefore, the inner product is given by:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x},\\tau) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\vec{x},\\tau)$\n\nThis expression represents twice the free part of the Euclidean action for the scalar field. It is the central piece of the Gaussian functional integral that defines the free theory's partition function.\n\n---\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   The system is a neutral scalar field at finite temperature $T$.\n*   The calculation uses the functional integral in Euclidean spacetime, with imaginary time $\\tau$ compactified with period $\\beta = 1/T$.\n*   The action is split into a free (quadratic) part $S_0$ and an interaction part $S_{int}$.\n*   The quadratic part $S_0$ is manipulated via integration by parts, using periodic boundary conditions in time and vanishing fields at spatial infinity.\n*   This reveals the form $S_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, from which we identify the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature is given by the expression:\n$$\n(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x},\\tau) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\vec{x},\\tau)\n$$\nwhere $\\phi(\\vec{x},\\tau)$ is the scalar field, $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\\tau$ is the imaginary time, $m$ is the mass of the field, and the operator $D_\\phi = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. This expression is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_0[\\phi]$.>>>"
