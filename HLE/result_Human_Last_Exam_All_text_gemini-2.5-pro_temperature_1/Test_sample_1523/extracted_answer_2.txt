The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature is given by the expression:
$$
(\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \phi(\vec{x},\tau) \left( -\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2 \right) \phi(\vec{x},\tau)
$$
where $\phi(\vec{x},\tau)$ is the scalar field, $\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $\tau$ is the imaginary time, $m$ is the mass of the field, and the operator $D_\phi = -\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. This expression is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_0[\phi]$.
