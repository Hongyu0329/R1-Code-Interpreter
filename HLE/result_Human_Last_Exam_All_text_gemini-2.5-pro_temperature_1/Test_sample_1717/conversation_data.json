    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:**\n    First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. According to the game's data, for a single player in Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu's health is **3,640**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula:**\n    In Terraria's Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player in the world. The formula for this health scaling is:\n    `Total Health = Base Health × (1 + 0.35 × (Number of Players - 1))`\n    *   `Base Health` is the boss's health for one player (3,640 in this case).\n    *   `0.35` represents the 35% health increase per additional player.\n    *   `(Number of Players - 1)` accounts for the fact that the scaling only applies to players after the first one.\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Infinite Players\" Condition to the Formula:**\n    The question asks for the health with an *infinite* number of players. We can analyze this by looking at what happens to the formula as the \"Number of Players\" (let's call it `N`) approaches infinity (`N → ∞`).\n    `Total Health = 3640 × (1 + 0.35 × (N - 1))`\n    As `N` becomes infinitely large, the `(N - 1)` term also becomes infinitely large. Multiplying this by 0.35 and then by 3640 results in a value that also approaches infinity. Mathematically, the limit is infinite.\n\n4.  **Consider the Technical Limitations of the Game Engine:**\n    This is the most critical point. The question refers to the \"source code of the video game Terraria\". A computer program cannot store a truly infinite number. Values like health are stored in variables of a specific data type, which have a maximum possible value.\n    *   In Terraria's source code, the variable used to store the maximum health of an NPC (`NPC.lifeMax`) is a **32-bit signed integer** (often referred to as `int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer can store values from -2,147,483,648 to **2,147,483,647**.\n    *   Therefore, no matter how high the health calculation goes, the game engine cannot assign a value to the boss's health that is greater than the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer. Any calculation resulting in a higher number would be \"capped\" at this limit.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the mathematical formula for health scaling with an infinite number of players would yield an infinite result, the game's technical implementation provides a hard cap. The theoretical maximum health is limited by the maximum value of the data type used to store it in the source code.\n\n*   **Base Health (Expert, 1 Player):** 3,640\n*   **Health Scaling:** Increases with the number of players.\n*   **Limiting Factor:** The `NPC.lifeMax` variable is a 32-bit signed integer.\n*   **Maximum Value:** The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2,147,483,647.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can have is **2,147,483,647**.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
