    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks for the number of times Anton Chekhov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic of his changing mentality and servility. The task is to carefully read the story and count each distinct instance where the coat is mentioned or where an action involving the coat (putting it on, taking it off) is described.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key moments in the story involving the coat.**\nThe story's plot revolves around Otchumyelov's vacillating judgment about a dog bite, with his opinion changing each time he receives new information about the dog's owner. His physical reaction, symbolized by his coat, changes with his opinion.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a chronological count of each description/action.**\n\n1.  **First Instance:** At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov introduces the character and his attire.\n    *   **Description:** Otchumyelov is described as \"wearing a new **overcoat** and carrying a parcel under his arm.\" This establishes the coat as part of his official, imposing uniform.\n\n2.  **Second Instance:** The first shift in his attitude occurs when he hears the dog might belong to the powerful General Zhigalov.\n    *   **Description:** He becomes flustered and hot, saying to the policeman, \"Take my **coat** off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\" This action signifies his shedding of authority and his anxiety in the face of a potential superior.\n\n3.  **Third Instance:** A policeman then claims the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov's confidence returns.\n    *   **Description:** He suddenly feels a chill, saying, \"Put my **coat** on, Yeldyrin, my lad... there's a wind getting up... I am shivering.\" He literally puts his authority back on.\n\n4.  **Fourth Instance:** Another person in the crowd contradicts the policeman, insisting the dog does belong to the General.\n    *   **Description:** Otchumyelov immediately becomes hot and subservient again, ordering, \"Take my **overcoat** off, Yeldyrin...\" This is the second time he removes the coat out of fear of offending a person of high status.\n\n5.  **Fifth Instance:** The General's cook arrives and states that the dog is not theirs. Otchumyelov's authoritative stance returns once more.\n    *   **Description:** Feeling another \"breeze,\" he commands, \"Put my **coat** on, brother Yeldyrin.\" He is again cloaking himself in his official power.\n\n6.  **Sixth Instance:** In the final resolution, the cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother. Otchumyelov's tone becomes fawning. As he leaves the scene, his final action with the coat is described.\n    *   **Description:** He concludes his business and departs, \"...wrapping himself in his **greatcoat**, he goes on his way across the square.\" This final act shows him reassuming his official public image after the confusing incident is over.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The count is not just of the word \"coat\" but of each distinct descriptive moment or action involving the coat.\n*   Chekhov uses synonyms like \"overcoat,\" \"coat,\" and \"greatcoat,\" all referring to the same symbolic garment.\n*   Each of the six instances directly corresponds to a shift in Otchumyelov's thinking and his chameleon-like change in demeanor, confirming the coat's symbolic function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy tallying each distinct description or action involving the coat, from the initial introduction to the final act of wrapping himself in it, we arrive at a total of six instances.\n\n<<<6>>>"
