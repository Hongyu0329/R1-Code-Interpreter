    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Core Task:** The problem asks to compare two strings lexicographically.\n2.  **Input:** Two strings are provided, one on each line.\n3.  **String Properties:**\n    *   They consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n    *   They are guaranteed to be of the same length.\n    *   The length of each string is between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive.\n4.  **Comparison Rule:** The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means 'a' is treated as equal to 'A', 'b' to 'B', and so on.\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n6.  **Primary Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". We need to calculate the total memory in bytes (`m`) used by the variables in this optimal program.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Memory Efficiency:** The main goal is to minimize the amount of memory used by variables. A naive solution might store both strings in memory, but this is not optimal. Since `stdin` is a forward-only stream, we can't read from both strings simultaneously without storing at least one. The most efficient approach is to store the first string completely and then read the second string one character at a time, comparing as we go.\n2.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** For each pair of characters being compared, they must first be converted to a common case (either both lowercase or both uppercase). The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is suitable for this.\n3.  **Input Handling:** Reading input character by character (e.g., with `getchar()`) is a good way to manage memory. We need to handle the newline character (`\\n`) that separates the two input strings.\n4.  **Variable Sizing:** We must choose appropriate data types. For an index, an `int` is standard. For reading characters with `getchar()`, the variable must be an `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` value. The buffer for the first string must be large enough for the maximum length (100) plus a null terminator, so a size of 101 is required.\n5.  **Minimal Variable Set:** An optimal program will declare only the essential variables. By printing and exiting as soon as a difference is found, we can avoid using an extra variable to store the result.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Memory Analysis\n\nTo write the most memory-efficient C program, we will follow the strategy of storing only the first string.\n\n**1. Identify Necessary Variables:**\nA C program to implement this strategy needs the following variables:\n*   A character array to act as a buffer for the first string. Since the maximum length is 100, we need `char s1[101];` to store the characters and the terminating null character (`\\0`).\n*   A variable to read characters from the input stream. The `getchar()` function returns an `int`, so we need an `int` variable (e.g., `int c;`) to store its return value.\n*   An index to traverse the buffered first string (`s1`). An `int` (e.g., `int i;`) is the most common and efficient choice for an index on typical systems.\n\n**2. Proposed C Code Structure (for analysis purposes):**\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char s1[101];\n    int c;\n    int i = 0;\n\n    // Read the first string into the buffer s1\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        s1[i++] = (char)c;\n    }\n    s1[i] = '\\0'; // Null-terminate the string\n\n    // Reset index and compare with the second string\n    i = 0;\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        c = getchar(); // Read one character of the second string\n\n        // Perform case-insensitive comparison\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower((char)c)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit immediately\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower((char)c)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit immediately\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Calculate Memory Usage:**\nWe will assume standard data type sizes on a typical competitive programming platform (e.g., a 32-bit or 64-bit Linux system where `int` is 4 bytes).\n\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: This array holds 101 characters. The size of a `char` is 1 byte.\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n*   **`int c`**: This variable holds the integer value returned by `getchar()`. The size of an `int` is 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n*   **`int i`**: This variable is used as a loop index. The size of an `int` is 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nThe total memory used for variables is the sum of the memory for each declared variable.\nm = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `c`) + (memory for `i`)\nm = 101 + 4 + 4\nm = 109 bytes.\n\nThis represents the memory footprint for the variables in the most memory-efficient implementation.\n\n<<<109>>>"
