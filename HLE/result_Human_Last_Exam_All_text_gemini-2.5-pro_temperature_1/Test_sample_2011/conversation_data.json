    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the question\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\nLet `G = (V, E)` be a graph with `|V| = 128`.\nA **clique** is a subset of vertices `C ⊆ V` such that every two distinct vertices in `C` are adjacent. This is equivalent to saying the subgraph induced by `C`, denoted `G[C]`, is a complete graph `K_{|C|}`.\nThe **size of a clique** `C` is the number of vertices in it, `|C|`.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum value of `|S(G)|`, where `S(G) = {k | G contains a clique of size k}`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the set of clique sizes `S(G)`\n\nLet `ω(G)` be the **clique number** of `G`, which is the size of the largest clique in `G`.\nBy definition, `ω(G) = max(S(G))`.\n\nIf a graph `G` contains a clique `C` of size `k`, then `G[C]` is a complete graph `K_k`. Any subset of `C` of size `j` (where `1 ≤ j ≤ k`) is also a clique. This is because if all vertices in `C` are pairwise adjacent, then all vertices in any subset of `C` are also pairwise adjacent.\n\nThis implies that if `k ∈ S(G)`, then `j ∈ S(G)` for all `1 ≤ j ≤ k`.\nTherefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in `G` must be of the form `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`.\nThe number of different clique sizes is `|S(G)| = ω(G)`.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the problem simplifies to finding the maximum possible clique number `ω(G)` for a graph `G` on 128 vertices. The maximum possible clique in a graph with `n` vertices is `n`. This is achieved by the complete graph `K_n`. For `n=128`, the graph `K_{128}` has `ω(K_{128}) = 128`. Thus, `K_{128}` contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. The number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n### Step 3: Considering a more nuanced interpretation (Careful Points)\n\nThe phrasing \"analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points\" suggests that the problem might be more complex than the straightforward interpretation above. The initial interpretation leads to a somewhat trivial answer.\n\nA possible subtlety lies in the interpretation of \"different clique sizes\". The existence of a `K_k` automatically implies the existence of `K_j` for all `j < k`. One might argue that these smaller cliques are not \"fundamentally\" different, as they are contained within the larger one. This leads to an alternative interpretation where we count the sizes of **maximal cliques**.\n\nA **maximal clique** is a clique that cannot be extended by adding any other vertex from the graph. That is, `C` is a maximal clique if `C` is a clique, and for any vertex `v ∈ V \\ C`, the set `C ∪ {v}` is not a clique.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem under this interpretation: Determine the maximum possible number of different sizes of maximal cliques in a single graph on 128 vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing the number of maximal clique sizes\n\nLet `S_M(G)` be the set of sizes of maximal cliques in `G`. We want to maximize `|S_M(G)|`.\n\nTo construct a graph with many different maximal clique sizes, consider a graph `G` that is a disjoint union of several complete graphs:\n`G = K_{k_1} ∪ K_{k_2} ∪ ... ∪ K_{k_m}`\nThe total number of vertices in this graph is `n = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`.\n\nIn such a graph, a clique is entirely contained within one of the components. The maximal cliques of `G` are precisely the vertex sets of the components `K_{k_i}`. The sizes of these maximal cliques are `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`.\n\nTo maximize the number of *different* sizes, we should choose `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m` to be distinct positive integers. Our goal is to maximize `m`, the number of such distinct integers.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to a number theory question: Find the maximum number of distinct positive integers that sum to 128.\n`k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m = 128`, where `k_i > 0` and `k_i ≠ k_j` for `i ≠ j`.\n\nTo maximize `m` (the number of terms) for a fixed sum, the integers `k_i` should be as small as possible. So, we should choose the smallest distinct positive integers: `1, 2, 3, ...`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculation\n\nWe need to find the largest `m` such that the sum of the first `m` positive integers is at most 128.\nThe sum of the first `m` positive integers is `S_m = 1 + 2 + ... + m = m(m+1)/2`.\nWe must have `m(m+1)/2 ≤ 128`.\n`m(m+1) ≤ 256`.\n\nLet's test values of `m`:\n- If `m = 15`, `15 × (15+1) = 15 × 16 = 240`. Since `240 ≤ 256`, it is possible to have `m=15`.\n- If `m = 16`, `16 × (16+1) = 16 × 17 = 272`. Since `272 > 256`, it is not possible to have `m=16`.\n\nThe maximum number of distinct parts is 15.\n\nWe must also confirm that there exist 15 distinct positive integers that sum to exactly 128.\nThe minimum sum for 15 distinct positive integers is `1 + 2 + ... + 15 = 120`.\nWe have `128 - 120 = 8` \"leftover\" sum to distribute. We can add this amount to the 15 integers while keeping them distinct. For example, we can add 1 to each of the 8 largest integers:\nThe original set of sizes is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}`.\nAdding 1 to the largest 8 terms (`8` through `15`) gives the new set of sizes:\n`{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, (8+1), (9+1), (10+1), (11+1), (12+1), (13+1), (14+1), (15+1)}`\n`= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}`.\nThese are 15 distinct positive integers. Let's check their sum:\nSum = `(1+2+...+15) + 8 = 120 + 8 = 128`.\nThis confirms that we can find 15 such integers.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nWe can construct a graph `G` on 128 vertices that has 15 different sizes of maximal cliques. For example, the graph:\n`G = K_1 ∪ K_2 ∪ K_3 ∪ K_4 ∪ K_5 ∪ K_6 ∪ K_7 ∪ K_9 ∪ K_{10} ∪ K_{11} ∪ K_{12} ∪ K_{13} ∪ K_{14} ∪ K_{15} ∪ K_{16}`\nThis graph has `1+2+...+7+9+...+16 = 128` vertices. It has maximal cliques of 15 different sizes.\n\nIt is not possible to have 16 different maximal clique sizes, as the minimum number of vertices required would be `1+2+...+16 = 136`, which is more than 128.\nThis more nuanced interpretation seems more likely to be the intended question given the prompt's instructions.\n\n<<<15>>>"
