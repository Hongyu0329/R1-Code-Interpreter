    "An analysis of the connectivity of the map $\\sigma: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the spaces**\n\nThe map is $\\sigma: A \\to B$, where:\n*   The source space is $A = \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   The target space is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nWe can simplify the target space. The smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homeomorphic to $S^{10}$.\nSo, the target space is $B = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the target space B**\n\nThe connectivity of a space is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\nThe homotopy groups of a loop space are related to the homotopy groups of the original space by the formula $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) = \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\nFor the target space $B = \\Omega S^{10}$:\n$\\pi_i(B) = \\pi_i(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^{10})$.\n\nThe homotopy groups of a sphere $\\pi_k(S^n)$ are trivial for $k < n$.\nSo, $\\pi_{i+1}(S^{10}) = 0$ for $i+1 < 10$, which means $i < 9$.\nTherefore, $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^{10}) = 0$ for all $i \\le 8$.\nThis means the target space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is **8-connected**.\nThe first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the connectivity of the source space A**\n\nThe source space is $A = \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. We need to determine its connectivity by analyzing its constituent parts.\n\n1.  **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^4$**:\n    $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^4)$.\n    $\\pi_1(S^4) = 0$, so $\\pi_0(\\Omega S^4) = 0$ (path-connected).\n    $\\pi_2(S^4) = 0$, so $\\pi_1(\\Omega S^4) = 0$ (simply connected).\n    $\\pi_3(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$, so $\\pi_2(\\Omega S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    The lowest non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_2$. So, $\\Omega S^4$ is **1-connected**.\n\n2.  **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^6$**:\n    $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^6)$.\n    $\\pi_k(S^6) = 0$ for $k < 6$.\n    So $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^6) = 0$ for $i+1 < 6$, i.e., $i < 5$.\n    The lowest non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    So, $\\Omega S^6$ is **4-connected**.\n\n3.  **Connectivity of the smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$**:\n    There is a standard result in homotopy theory: if $X$ is $c_X$-connected and $Y$ is $c_Y$-connected (and they are CW-complexes), their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(c_X + c_Y + 1)$-connected.\n    Using the connectivities we found: $c_X = 1$ and $c_Y = 4$.\n    The connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $1 + 4 + 1 = 6$. So, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is **6-connected**.\n\n4.  **Connectivity of the suspension $\\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$**:\n    The suspension of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected.\n    Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 6-connected, its suspension $A = \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(6+1) = 7$-connected.\n    So, $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ for $i \\le 7$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy groups**\n\nWe need to know the first non-trivial homotopy group of the source space $A$.\nSince $A$ is 7-connected, we look at $\\pi_8(A)$.\nBy the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, the suspension map $E: \\pi_i(Z) \\to \\pi_{i+1}(\\Sigma Z)$ is an isomorphism for $i < 2k+1$, where $k$ is the connectivity of $Z$.\nHere $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$, with connectivity $k=6$. So $2k+1 = 13$.\nFor $i=7$, we have $7 < 13$, so the map $E: \\pi_7(Z) \\to \\pi_8(\\Sigma Z) = \\pi_8(A)$ is an isomorphism.\nBy the Hurewicz Theorem, since $Z$ is 6-connected, $\\pi_7(Z) \\cong H_7(Z)$.\nWe calculate the homology group using the KÃ¼nneth formula for smash products over $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n$\\tilde{H}_n(X \\wedge Y) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} (\\tilde{H}_p(X) \\otimes \\tilde{H}_q(Y)) \\oplus \\bigoplus_{p+q=n-1} \\text{Tor}(\\tilde{H}_p(X), \\tilde{H}_q(Y))$.\nFor $X = \\Omega S^4$, the first non-trivial reduced homology group is $H_2(\\Omega S^4)=\\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor $Y = \\Omega S^6$, the first non-trivial reduced homology group is $H_5(\\Omega S^6)=\\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor $H_7(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, the only non-zero term comes from the tensor product part with $p=2, q=5$. All other terms are zero because they involve a homology group of degree less than the first non-trivial one. The Tor terms are also zero as they involve free groups.\n$H_7(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_2(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $\\pi_8(A) \\cong \\pi_7(Z) \\cong H_7(Z) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the connectivity of the map $\\sigma$**\n\nA map $f: X \\to Y$ is said to be **k-connected** if the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f): \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection (epimorphism) for $i=k$. We seek the largest such $k$.\n\nLet's check the condition for our map $\\sigma: A \\to B$.\n\n*   **For $i < 8$**: We need $\\pi_i(\\sigma)$ to be an isomorphism.\n    *   For $i \\le 7$, we have $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ and $\\pi_i(B) = 0$. The map $\\pi_i(\\sigma): 0 \\to 0$ is an isomorphism. This holds.\n\n*   **For $i = 8$**: We need $\\pi_8(\\sigma)$ to be a surjection.\n    *   The source group is $\\pi_8(A) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The target group is $\\pi_8(B) = \\pi_8(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_9(S^{10})$. By the Freudenthal suspension theorem, $\\pi_9(S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_2(S^3) = 0$. So $\\pi_8(B) = 0$.\n    *   The map is $\\pi_8(\\sigma): \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$. This is the zero map, which is surjective. This holds.\n\nBased on the checks for $i \\le 8$, the map $\\sigma$ is at least 8-connected.\n\n*   **Is the map 9-connected?**\n    For a map to be 9-connected, $\\pi_i(\\sigma)$ must be an isomorphism for all $i < 9$. This means, in particular, that $\\pi_8(\\sigma)$ must be an isomorphism.\n    The map $\\pi_8(\\sigma): \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$ is not an isomorphism, as its kernel is $\\mathbb{Z}$, not the trivial group.\n    Since the condition fails for $i=8$, the map is not 9-connected.\n\nThe highest integer $k$ for which the map is $k$-connected is 8."
