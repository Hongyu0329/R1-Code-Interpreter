    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input Data and the Object of Study\nThe problem asks for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a \"Calabi-Yau Link\". This link is defined by a polynomial equation within an ambient space, which is a weighted projective space.\n\n*   **Polynomial Equation:** $F = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$\n*   **Ambient Space:** A 4-dimensional weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n*   **Weights:** $w = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\nThe link itself is the intersection of the affine variety defined by $F=0$ in $\\mathbb{C}^5$ with the unit sphere $S^9 \\subset \\mathbb{C}^5$. This link is a 7-dimensional manifold.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition and Homogeneity\nA hypersurface in a weighted projective space is called Calabi-Yau if the degree of the defining polynomial, $d$, is equal to the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$. The polynomial must be quasi-homogeneous, meaning all its monomials have the same weighted degree.\n\n1.  **Sum of Weights:**\n    $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    So, for the Calabi-Yau condition to hold, the degree $d$ must be 225.\n\n2.  **Weighted Degree of Monomials:** Let's calculate the degree of each term in the polynomial $F$.\n    *   `deg`(z₁⁸z₃) = 8 * w₁ + 1 * w₃ = 8 * 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₁⁴z₂³z₃) = 4 * w₁ + 3 * w₂ + 1 * w₃ = 4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224.\n    *   `deg`(z₁z₂⁷) = 1 * w₁ + 7 * w₂ = 1 * 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₁z₂z₃z₄z₅) = w₁ + w₂ + w₃ + w₄ + w₅ = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₂z₃⁴) = 1 * w₂ + 4 * w₃ = 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₄³z₅) = 3 * w₄ + 1 * w₅ = 3 * 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225.\n    *   `deg`(z₅³) = 3 * w₅ = 3 * 75 = 225.\n\n**Careful Point:** The second monomial, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, has a degree of 224, while all others have a degree of 225. This means the given polynomial is not quasi-homogeneous. In the context of such problems, this usually implies a typo in the problem statement. The intended polynomial should be quasi-homogeneous with degree $d = \\sum w_i = 225$. We will proceed by assuming that the invariant depends only on the weights and the degree, which would be true for any generic non-degenerate polynomial with these properties.\n\n### Step 3: The Crawley-Nordström Invariant and the Signature Formula\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant, $cn(K)$, for the 7-dimensional link manifold $K$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. It is defined in terms of the signature, $\\sigma$, of the 8-dimensional Milnor fiber, which is a manifold whose boundary is the link $K$. The formula is:\n$cn(K) = \\frac{\\sigma}{8} \\pmod 2$.\n\nTo compute this, we need to determine the value of $\\sigma$ modulo 16. A direct calculation of $\\sigma$ is very complex. However, we can relate it to the Milnor number, $\\mu$, of the singularity.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Milnor Number\nFor a generic (non-degenerate) quasi-homogeneous singularity defined by weights $(w_1, ..., w_n)$ and degree $d$, the Milnor number $\\mu$ is given by the formula:\n$\\mu = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{d}{w_i} - 1\\right)$.\n\nLet's compute this for our case ($n=5$, $d=225$):\n*   $\\frac{d}{w_1} - 1 = \\frac{225}{22} - 1 = \\frac{203}{22}$\n*   $\\frac{d}{w_2} - 1 = \\frac{225}{29} - 1 = \\frac{196}{29}$\n*   $\\frac{d}{w_3} - 1 = \\frac{225}{49} - 1 = \\frac{176}{49}$\n*   $\\frac{d}{w_4} - 1 = \\frac{225}{50} - 1 = \\frac{175}{50}$\n*   $\\frac{d}{w_5} - 1 = \\frac{225}{75} - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$\n\nNow, we multiply these values:\n$\\mu = \\frac{203}{22} \\times \\frac{196}{29} \\times \\frac{176}{49} \\times \\frac{175}{50} \\times 2$\n\nTo simplify, we factor the numbers:\n*   $203 = 7 \\times 29$\n*   $196 = 4 \\times 49 = 2^2 \\times 7^2$\n*   $176 = 16 \\times 11 = 2^4 \\times 11$\n*   $175 = 7 \\times 25 = 7 \\times 5^2$\n*   $22 = 2 \\times 11$\n*   $50 = 2 \\times 25 = 2 \\times 5^2$\n\nSubstituting these factors into the expression for $\\mu$:\n$\\mu = \\frac{7 \\times 29}{2 \\times 11} \\times \\frac{2^2 \\times 7^2}{29} \\times \\frac{2^4 \\times 11}{7^2} \\times \\frac{7 \\times 5^2}{2 \\times 5^2} \\times 2$\n\nNow we cancel terms between the numerator and denominator:\n$\\mu = \\frac{7 \\cdot \\cancel{29} \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot \\cancel{7^2} \\cdot 2^4 \\cdot \\cancel{11} \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cancel{5^2} \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot \\cancel{11} \\cdot \\cancel{29} \\cdot \\cancel{7^2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\cancel{5^2}}$\n$\\mu = \\frac{7 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 2^4 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{7^2 \\cdot 2^7}{2^2} = 7^2 \\cdot 2^5 = 49 \\times 32$\n$\\mu = 1568$.\n\n### Step 5: Relating the Signature to the Milnor Number\nFor singularities, there exist congruences relating the signature $\\sigma$ and the Milnor number $\\mu$. For surface singularities ($n=3$), a known result is $\\sigma \\equiv -\\mu \\pmod 8$. For Calabi-Yau 3-fold singularities ($n=5$, $d=\\sum w_i$), it is known that the signature $\\sigma$ is divisible by 8. Let's check if our calculated Milnor number is also divisible by 8:\n$1568 \\div 8 = 196$.\nYes, $\\mu \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. The relation $\\sigma \\equiv -\\mu \\pmod 8$ is consistent with this.\n\nTo find the Crawley-Nordström invariant, we need $\\sigma \\pmod{16}$. Let's assume the congruence extends, i.e., $\\sigma \\equiv -\\mu \\pmod{16}$. This is a reasonable conjecture in the absence of a more direct formula.\n\nLet's calculate $\\mu$ modulo 16:\n$1568 \\div 16 = 98$.\nSo, $\\mu = 1568 = 98 \\times 16 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nUsing our working assumption $\\sigma \\equiv -\\mu \\pmod{16}$:\n$\\sigma \\equiv -0 \\pmod{16} \\implies \\sigma \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\n\nThis means that $\\sigma$ is a multiple of 16. Let $\\sigma = 16k$ for some integer $k$.\nNow we can compute the Crawley-Nordström invariant:\n$cn(K) = \\frac{\\sigma}{8} \\pmod 2 = \\frac{16k}{8} \\pmod 2 = 2k \\pmod 2$.\nSince $2k$ is always an even number, $2k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nTherefore, the Crawley-Nordström invariant is 0."
