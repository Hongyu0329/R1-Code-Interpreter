    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"a joy-discovering sailor\"** - This poetic phrase, attributed to the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky, suggests the man was an explorer or someone associated with sea voyages who brought back something positive or was on a mission of goodwill and discovery.\n*   **Clue 2: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"** - This question, also from Voznesensky, is a powerful indicator that the man's burial place was unknown or lost for a significant period. It points to a historical mystery.\n*   **Clue 3: \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"** - This provides a specific historical timeframe for when the mystery of the grave was solved or when its location became known to the public. This timing coincides with the Glasnost era in the Soviet Union, a period when many historical truths were being uncovered.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues to Andrei Voznesensky's Work**\n\n*   The combination of a romantic sailor/explorer figure and a lost grave is strongly characteristic of Voznesensky's most famous work, the rock opera **\"Juno and Avos\"** (\"Юнона и Авось\"). He wrote the libretto for this immensely popular production which premiered in 1981.\n*   The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is a historical figure whose story fits the description perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Historical Figure**\n\n*   The central figure of \"Juno and Avos\" is Count **Nikolai Rezanov**, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer.\n*   **\"Sailor\"**: Rezanov was one of the commanders of Russia's first circumnavigation of the globe and the founder of the Russian-American Company, making the term \"sailor\" or explorer very fitting.\n*   **\"Lost Grave\"**: On his return journey from Russian America, Rezanov fell ill and died in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807. He was buried in the crypt of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, the cathedral was demolished by the Soviet authorities in the 20th century, and the exact location of his grave was lost.\n*   **\"Answer Emerged in the Late 1980s\"**: The huge success of \"Juno and Avos\" created massive public interest in Rezanov's fate. This spurred historical research and a public campaign to find and properly memorialize his grave. In the late 1970s and through the 1980s, during construction work on the former cathedral site, his presumed burial plot was located. The public answer to Voznesensky's poetic question truly \"emerged\" during this period as the story became widely known and the grave site was formally acknowledged.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The man described is Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The poetic descriptions are from Voznesensky's work about him. The story of his lost and later rediscovered grave perfectly matches the timeline given. The question asks for the man's last name.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The phrase \"joy-discovering sailor\" is a poetic interpretation of Rezanov's mission, which was to establish trade and diplomatic relations.\n*   The \"discovery\" in the late 1980s was more of a public and official re-acknowledgment and memorialization rather than a brand-new archaeological find, but it effectively answered the long-standing question for the public.\n*   The link to Voznesensky and his specific, highly famous work is the key to solving the riddle.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
