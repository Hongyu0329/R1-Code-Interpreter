    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atomic composition.**\nThe molecule is toluene. Its chemical structure is a benzene ring attached to a methyl group.\n- The benzene ring part is C6H5.\n- The methyl group is -CH3.\n- Combining these, the molecular formula is C7H8.\n- Therefore, a toluene molecule contains **7 Carbon (C) atoms** and **8 Hydrogen (H) atoms**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation and apply it to Carbon (C).**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. For a second-row atom like Carbon, the notation is interpreted as follows:\n-   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The \"**6-**\" indicates that the core 1s atomic orbital is described by a single **contracted** Gaussian function (CGF). This single CGF is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    -   Contribution from core (1s): **1 CGF**\n-   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The \"**-31**\" indicates that the valence shell is \"split\" into two parts. This means each valence atomic orbital is represented by two CGFs.\n    -   An \"inner\" valence CGF, constructed from **3** PGFs.\n    -   An \"outer\" valence CGF, constructed from **1** PGF.\n-   Carbon has one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz) in its valence shell.\n    -   For the 2s orbital: It is split into two functions. Contribution = **2 CGFs**.\n    -   For the 2p orbitals: Each of the three p-orbitals (px, py, pz) is split into two functions. Contribution = 3 orbitals * 2 CGFs/orbital = **6 CGFs**.\n-   **Total CGFs for one Carbon atom** = 1 (from 1s) + 2 (from 2s) + 6 (from 2p) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the 6-31G basis set notation to Hydrogen (H).**\nFor a first-row atom like Hydrogen, there are no core electrons, only the 1s valence orbital.\n-   The \"6-\" prefix does not apply.\n-   The \"**-31**\" part describes the splitting of the 1s valence orbital. Like with Carbon's valence orbitals, the 1s orbital is split into two CGFs.\n    -   An \"inner\" CGF from **3** PGFs.\n    -   An \"outer\" CGF from **1** PGF.\n-   **Total CGFs for one Hydrogen atom** = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8).**\nNow, we sum the contributions from all atoms in the molecule.\n-   Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**.\n-   Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**.\n-   **Total number of CGFs** = 63 + 16 = **79**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n-   Ensure the correct atom count for the molecule (7 C, 8 H for toluene).\n-   Correctly interpret the basis set notation for different types of atoms (core/valence for Carbon, valence-only for Hydrogen).\n-   Remember that the number of contracted Gaussian functions is equivalent to the total number of basis functions reported in a quantum chemistry software output for this calculation.\n-   Do not confuse contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) with primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). The question specifically asks for the former.\n\nThe final answer is the sum of the CGFs from all atoms in the molecule.\n\n<<<79>>>"
