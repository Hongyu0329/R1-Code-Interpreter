    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Must belong to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\" of philosophy and logic.\n    *   **Key Action:** \"decomposes\" or analyzes a concept.\n    *   **Concept Analyzed:** \"hallmark\" (This is likely a translation of a more specific philosophical term for a sign or indicator, such as the Polish *oznaka*).\n    *   **Components of the Decomposition:** \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was a highly influential school of Polish thought in the early 20th century, founded by Kazimierz Twardowski.\n    *   It is known for its focus on logic, semantics, analytical philosophy, and the philosophy of language.\n    *   Key figures include Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The answer must be one of these or a related figure.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Philosophical Distinction (Symptoms vs. Signals):**\n    *   The distinction between \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" is a classification of natural signs based on their causal and temporal relationship to the thing they signify.\n    *   A **symptom** is typically understood as an *effect* of the thing it indicates. It points to a past or present state of affairs. For example, a fever is a symptom of an ongoing illness. Smoke is a symptom of a fire that is currently burning.\n    *   A **signal**, in this specific philosophical context, is understood as a *cause* of a future event it indicates. It points to something that is about to happen. For example, a sharp drop in a barometer's reading is a signal of an impending storm.\n\n4.  **Connect the Distinction to a Philosopher from the School:**\n    *   We need to find which philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School made this specific analysis of natural signs.\n    *   While many in the school worked on language and logic, the philosopher most renowned for this particular semantic and epistemological classification of signs is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   In his works on language and meaning (e.g., \"Pragmatic Logic\"), Ajdukiewicz provides a detailed taxonomy of signs. He distinguishes between natural signs and conventional signs. Within the category of natural signs (*oznaki*), he makes the precise distinction between symptoms and signals.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the philosopher who analyzed the concept of a natural sign (referred to in the question as a \"hallmark\") and broke it down into the categories of **symptoms** (as effects pointing to the past/present) and **signals** (as causes pointing to the future).\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Translation:** The term \"hallmark\" is a slightly non-standard translation. The original Polish term used by Ajdukiewicz is often *oznaka*, which is more accurately translated as \"mark,\" \"indicator,\" or \"natural sign.\" However, the core concepts of \"symptom\" and \"signal\" are the key identifiers.\n*   **Causality:** The distinction hinges on the direction of causality and time. A symptom is an effect of its referent (illness -> fever). A signal is a cause of its referent (falling barometer -> storm, as part of a larger causal system).\n*   **School Focus:** While the entire school was analytical, Ajdukiewicz's work in semantics and epistemology makes him the prime candidate for this type of classification, which stands out from the more purely logical work of figures like Łukasiewicz or Tarski.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
