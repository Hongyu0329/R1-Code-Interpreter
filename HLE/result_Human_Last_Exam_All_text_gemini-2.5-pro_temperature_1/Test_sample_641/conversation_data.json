    "An involution in a group $G$ is an element $x$ of order 2, i.e., $x^2=1$ and $x \\neq 1$. We are asked to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Group PSU(n, q)**\n    The group $\\text{PSU}(n, q)$ is defined as the quotient group $\\text{SU}(n, q) / Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$, where $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ is the special unitary group and $Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$ is its center.\n    In our case, $n=4$ and $q=997$. Note that 997 is a prime number.\n    The center $Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^{\\gcd(n, q+1)} = 1$. The order of the center is $|Z| = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\n    For $\\text{PSU}(4, 997)$, we have $|Z| = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$.\n    Since $998 = 2 \\times 499$, $\\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\n    So, the center is $Z = \\{I, -I\\}$, where $I$ is the 4x4 identity matrix.\n\n2.  **Relating Involutions in PSU(4, q) to Elements in SU(4, q)**\n    An element $x=gZ \\in \\text{PSU}(4, q)$ is an involution if $(gZ)^2 = 1_G$ and $gZ \\neq 1_G$.\n    The condition $(gZ)^2 = g^2Z = Z$ means that $g^2 \\in Z$.\n    The condition $gZ \\neq Z$ means that $g \\notin Z$.\n    Since $Z=\\{I, -I\\}$, we are looking for the number of elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that:\n    a) $g^2=I$ and $g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}$, OR\n    b) $g^2=-I$. (Note that if $g^2=-I$, then $g$ cannot be in $Z$, as $I^2=I$ and $(-I)^2=I$).\n\n    Let $S_1 = \\{ g \\in \\text{SU}(4,q) \\mid g^2=I, g \\notin \\{I, -I\\} \\}$.\n    Let $S_2 = \\{ g \\in \\text{SU}(4,q) \\mid g^2=-I \\}$.\n    The total number of such pre-images $g$ is $|S_1| + |S_2|$.\n    Each involution in $\\text{PSU}(4, q)$ corresponds to a coset $gZ$, which has $|Z|=2$ elements.\n    Therefore, the number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4, q)$ is $\\frac{|S_1| + |S_2|}{2}$.\n\n3.  **Counting the elements in S1**\n    Elements in $S_1$ are the non-central involutions in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$. An involution in the unitary group $\\text{U}(4, q)$ is a semi-simple element whose eigenvalues are $\\pm 1$. Such an element $g$ is characterized by the dimension of its eigenspace for the eigenvalue +1, let's call it $k$. The eigenspace for -1 will have dimension $4-k$.\n    The determinant of such an element is $\\det(g) = 1^k \\cdot (-1)^{4-k} = (-1)^{4-k}$.\n    For $g$ to be in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$, we must have $\\det(g)=1$, which implies that $4-k$ must be an even number. Thus, $k$ must be even.\n    Possible values for $k$ are 0, 2, 4.\n    *   $k=4$: $g$ is the identity matrix $I$. This is in the center.\n    *   $k=0$: $g$ is the matrix $-I$. This is also in the center.\n    *   $k=2$: These are the non-central involutions. Their number, denoted $N(n, k, q)$, is the number of non-degenerate $k$-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional unitary space. For $n=4, k=2$, this number is:\n        $|S_1| = N(4, 2, q) = q^{k(n-k)} \\frac{\\prod_{i=n-k+1}^n (q^i - (-1)^i)}{\\prod_{i=1}^k (q^i - (-1)^i)} = q^{2(2)} \\frac{(q^3-(-1)^3)(q^4-(-1)^4)}{(q^1-(-1)^1)(q^2-(-1)^2)}$\n        $|S_1| = q^4 \\frac{(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4 \\frac{(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n4.  **Counting the elements in S2**\n    Elements in $S_2$ are those $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$ with $g^2=-I$. The eigenvalues of such $g$ must be $i$ or $-i$ (where $i^2=-1$).\n    For an element to be in a unitary group over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, if $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue, then $1/\\bar{\\lambda}$ must also be an eigenvalue with the same multiplicity. Here $\\bar{\\lambda} = \\lambda^q$.\n    For $q=997$, we have $997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. This implies that $i \\in \\mathbb{F}_{997} \\subset \\mathbb{F}_{997^2}$, so $\\bar{i} = i^q = i$.\n    The condition becomes: if $\\lambda=i$ is an eigenvalue, so is $1/\\bar{i} = 1/i = -i$. This is satisfied if the eigenvalues $i$ and $-i$ appear with the same multiplicity. For a 4x4 matrix, the eigenvalues must be $\\{i, i, -i, -i\\}$.\n    The determinant of such a matrix is $\\det(g) = i \\cdot i \\cdot (-i) \\cdot (-i) = i^2(-i)^2 = (-1)(-1)=1$. This means all such elements in $\\text{U}(4, q)$ are automatically in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$.\n    These elements form a single conjugacy class in $\\text{U}(4, q)$. The number of such elements is given by the size of this class:\n    $|S_2| = \\frac{|\\text{U}(4, q)|}{|C_{\\text{U}(4, q)}(g)|}$.\n    The centralizer $C_{\\text{U}(4, q)}(g)$ is known to be isomorphic to $\\text{GL}(2, q^2)$.\n    $|\\text{U}(4, q)| = q^{4(3)/2}(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1) = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$.\n    $|\\text{GL}(2, q^2)| = (q^{2 \\cdot 2}-1)(q^{2 \\cdot 2}-q^2) = (q^4-1)(q^4-q^2) = q^2(q^2-1)(q^4-1)$.\n    $|S_2| = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q^2(q^2-1)(q^4-1)} = q^4(q+1)(q^3+1)$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    The number of involutions in $\\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ is $\\frac{|S_1| + |S_2|}{2}$. Let $q=997$.\n    Number = $\\frac{1}{2} [q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q+1)(q^3+1)]$\n    Using $q^3+1 = (q+1)(q^2-q+1)$:\n    Number = $\\frac{1}{2} [q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)]$\n    Factor out the common term $q^4(q^2-q+1)$:\n    Number = $\\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1) [ (q^2+1) + (q+1)^2 ]$\n    Number = $\\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1) [ q^2+1 + q^2+2q+1 ]$\n    Number = $\\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1) [ 2q^2+2q+2 ]$\n    Number = $q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)$\n    Using the identity $(a-b)(a+b)=a^2-b^2}$ with $a=q^2+1, b=q$:\n    Number = $q^4((q^2+1)^2 - q^2) = q^4(q^4+2q^2+1 - q^2) = q^4(q^4+q^2+1)$.\n\n6.  **Numerical value**\n    We need to compute this value for $q=997$.\n    *   $q = 997$\n    *   $q^2 = 997^2 = 994,009$\n    *   $q^4 = (997^2)^2 = 994,009^2 = 988,053,892,081$\n    *   The expression is $q^4(q^4+q^2+1)$:\n        $988,053,892,081 \\times (988,053,892,081 + 994,009 + 1)$\n        $= 988,053,892,081 \\times (988,054,886,091)$\n        $= 976,246,395,568,581,456,133,071$"
