    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the manifold and its fundamental group**\n\nLet $\\Sigma = \\tau_5 K$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil knot $K$. We are considering the manifold $M$, which is the double branched cover of the 4-sphere $S^4$ branched over the knotted 2-sphere $\\Sigma$.\n\nThe fundamental group of a double branched cover is related to the fundamental group of the complement of the branch locus. For a double cover of a simply-connected manifold $X$ (like $S^4$) branched over a submanifold $L$ of codimension 2, the fundamental group of the cover $M$ is given by:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\Sigma) / \\langle\\langle m^2 = 1 \\rangle\\rangle $$\nwhere $m$ is any element representing a meridian of $\\Sigma$, and $\\langle\\langle m^2 = 1 \\rangle\\rangle$ denotes the normal subgroup generated by the relation $m^2=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the fundamental group of the complement of the twist-spun knot**\n\nThe fundamental group of the complement of a $k$-twist-spun knot, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_k K)$, can be described as an HNN extension of the knot group $G_K = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$. A presentation is given by:\n$$ \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_k K) = \\langle G_K, t \\mid t g t^{-1} = \\mu^k g \\mu^{-k} \\text{ for all } g \\in G_K \\rangle $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is an element of $G_K$ representing a meridian of the knot $K$.\n\nFor our problem, $K$ is the trefoil knot and $k=5$. The group of the trefoil knot, $G_K$, has the presentation:\n$$ G_K = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy \\rangle $$\nThe generators $x$ and $y$ correspond to meridians from a Wirtinger presentation. We can choose $\\mu = x$.\n\nSo, the fundamental group of the complement of $\\Sigma = \\tau_5 K$ is:\n$$ G_S = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\Sigma) = \\langle x, y, t \\mid xyx = yxy, \\, t g t^{-1} = x^5 g x^{-5} \\text{ for } g \\in \\{x, y\\} \\rangle $$\nLet's expand the relations involving $t$:\n1. For $g=x$: $txt^{-1} = x^5 x x^{-5} = x$. This means $t$ and $x$ commute: $tx=xt$.\n2. For $g=y$: $tyt^{-1} = x^5 y x^{-5}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the fundamental group of the double branched cover**\n\nWe now compute $\\pi_1(M)$ by taking the quotient of $G_S$ by the normal subgroup generated by $m^2=1$. The meridians of $\\Sigma$ correspond to the meridians of the original knot $K$. So we can set $m=x$. We add the relation $x^2=1$.\n\nThe group $\\pi_1(M)$, which we will call $\\pi$, has the presentation:\n$$ \\pi = \\langle x, y, t \\mid xyx = yxy, \\, tx=xt, \\, tyt^{-1} = x^5 y x^{-5}, \\, x^2=1 \\rangle $$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the presentation of the group $\\pi$**\n\nLet's simplify the relations using $x^2=1$, which implies $x=x^{-1}$.\n1.  The relation $x^5 = (x^2)^2 x = 1^2 x = x$ and $x^{-5}=x$.\n2.  The relation $tyt^{-1} = x^5 y x^{-5}$ becomes $tyt^{-1} = xyx$.\n3.  In the trefoil group $G_K=\\langle x, y \\mid xyx=yxy \\rangle$, the generators $x$ and $y$ are conjugate. Therefore, the relation $x^2=1$ implies that $y^2=1$ as well in the quotient group.\n4.  The relations on $x$ and $y$ are now $x^2=1$, $y^2=1$, and $xyx=yxy$. Multiplying $xyx=yxy$ by $y$ on the right gives $xyxy=yx$. Then multiplying by $x$ on the left gives $x(xyxy)=x(yx)$, which simplifies to $(xy)^2 = xyx$. Therefore $xy=x$, which implies $y=1$. This is incorrect. The relation $xyx=yxy$ with $x^2=1, y^2=1$ is equivalent to $(xy)^3=1$. The group generated by $x,y$ is the symmetric group $S_3$.\n    *   Let's check: $xyx=yxy \\implies (xyx)y=yxy^2=yx \\implies xyxy=yx$. Then $xyxyx=yxy$. So $y=yxy$. This implies $1=xy$, so $y=x$. This is incorrect.\n    *   Let's recheck the consequence of adding $x^2=1$. In $\\langle x,y|xyx=yxy\\rangle$, $y$ is conjugate to $x$ (e.g. $y=(xy)^{-1}x(xy)$). So $x^2=1 \\implies y^2=1$. The group $\\langle x,y | xyx=yxy, x^2=1 \\rangle$ is thus isomorphic to $\\langle x,y | x^2=1, y^2=1, xyx=yxy \\rangle$, which is a standard presentation for the symmetric group $S_3$.\n5.  Also, from $xyx=yxy$ and $x^2=1$, we have $tyt^{-1}=xyx=yxy$.\n\nSo, the simplified presentation for $\\pi$ is:\n$$ \\pi = \\langle x, y, t \\mid x^2=1, y^2=1, (xy)^3=1, \\, tx=xt, \\, tyt^{-1}=xyx \\rangle $$\nThe subgroup $H=\\langle x, y \\rangle$ is isomorphic to $S_3$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the structure of the group $\\pi$**\n\nThe relations show that $t$ acts on the subgroup $H=S_3$ by conjugation. Let $\\psi(g) = tgt^{-1}$. Then $\\psi(x)=x$ and $\\psi(y)=xyx$. This is an automorphism of $S_3$. The group $\\pi$ is a semidirect product $\\pi \\cong S_3 \\rtimes_\\psi \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's investigate this structure further. Define a new element $t' = xt$.\nLet's see how $t'$ commutes with the generators of $S_3$.\n1.  $[t', x] = t'x(t')^{-1}x^{-1} = (xt)x(xt)^{-1}x = xtxt^{-1}x^{-1}x = x(txt^{-1})x = x(x)x = x^3 = x$. This is not the commutator.\n    $t'x(t')^{-1} = (xt)x(xt)^{-1} = xtxt^{-1}x^{-1} = x(txt^{-1})x^{-1} = x(x)x^{-1} = x$. So $t'$ commutes with $x$.\n2.  $t'y(t')^{-1} = (xt)y(xt)^{-1} = xty(t^{-1}x^{-1}) = x(tyt^{-1})x^{-1} = x(xyx)x^{-1} = x(xyx)x = x^2yx^2 = y$. So $t'$ commutes with $y$.\n\nSince $t'$ commutes with both $x$ and $y$, it commutes with every element of the subgroup $H=S_3$.\nThe group $\\pi$ is generated by $\\{x, y, t\\}$. Since $t=x^{-1}t'=xt'$, the group is also generated by $\\{x, y, t'\\}$.\nThe relations between these generators are the relations for $S_3$ on $x,y$, and the fact that $t'$ is central.\nThis implies that $\\pi$ is isomorphic to the direct product of $S_3$ and the group generated by $t'$. Since $t$ has infinite order (as seen from the quotient $\\pi/S_3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$), $t'$ must also have infinite order.\nThus, $\\pi \\cong S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the minimal number of generators of $\\pi \\cong S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$**\n\nLet $d(G)$ be the minimal number of generators of a group $G$.\n1.  A lower bound for $d(\\pi)$ is the minimal number of generators of its abelianization, $\\pi_{ab}$.\n    $\\pi_{ab} = (S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z})_{ab} = (S_3)_{ab} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{ab}$.\n    The abelianization of $S_3$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    So, $\\pi_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    The minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ is 2. Thus, $d(\\pi) \\ge 2$.\n2.  We now check if $\\pi$ can be generated by 2 elements. We need to find a generating set $\\{g_1, g_2\\}$ for $S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Let's try to find generators of the form $(s_1, n_1)$ and $(s_2, n_2)$ where $s_i \\in S_3, n_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Consider the generating set $\\{ (x, 1), (y, 0) \\}$, where $x,y$ are the generators of $S_3$ (e.g., $x=(12), y=(23)$).\n    Let $G' = \\langle (x,1), (y,0) \\rangle$.\n    The subgroup of $G'$ consisting of elements with second component 0 is the normal closure of $\\langle (y,0) \\rangle$. This subgroup is generated by elements of the form $(x,1)^n (y,0) (x,1)^{-n} = (x^n y x^{-n}, 0)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    -   For $n=0$ (and any even $n$), we get $(y,0)$.\n    -   For $n=1$ (and any odd $n$), we get $(xyx, 0)$.\n    The set $\\{y, xyx\\}$ generates $S_3$. For example, if $x=(12), y=(23)$, then $xyx=(13)$. The transpositions $(23)$ and $(13)$ generate all of $S_3$.\n    So the subgroup of elements with second component 0 is $S_3 \\times \\{0\\}$.\n    Since we can generate all of $S_3 \\times \\{0\\}$ and we also have the element $(x,1)$, we can generate any element $(s,n) \\in S_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. For example, $(s,n) = (s (x^n)^{-1}, 0) \\cdot (x,1)^n$.\n    Therefore, $\\{ (x,1), (y,0) \\}$ is a generating set of size 2.\n\nSince $d(\\pi) \\ge 2$ and we found a generating set of size 2, the minimal number of generators is 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can directly show that the group $\\pi$ as presented before the isomorphism is generated by 2 elements. The set $\\{y, t\\}$ generates $\\pi$:\n1.  We have $y$ and $t$.\n2.  We can form $tyt^{-1} = xyx$.\n3.  We can then construct $x$ by the word $y(tyt^{-1})y = y(xyx)y$. In $S_3$, this evaluates to $y(yxy)y = y^2xy^2=x$.\n4.  Since we have constructed $x$, $y$, and we started with $t$, we have all the original generators of $\\pi$. Thus, $\\{y, t\\}$ is a generating set. This confirms $d(\\pi) \\le 2$.\n\nFinal conclusion: The minimal number of generators is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
