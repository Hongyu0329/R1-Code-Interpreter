    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist and Her Work**\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was a famous British painter renowned for her military scenes, particularly those involving the British Army during the Victorian era. The question asks for the latest *historical event* she depicted, not necessarily her last painting.\n\n**Step 2: List Major Battle Paintings by Lady Butler and their Historical Dates**\nWe need to compile a list of her famous paintings that portray specific historical battles and then find the date of each battle.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (Painted in 1875)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** The Battle of Quatre Bras.\n    *   **Historical Date:** June 16, **1815**. This was part of the Waterloo Campaign in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (Painted in 1881)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** The charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo.\n    *   **Historical Date:** June 18, **1815**.\n\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (Painted in 1879)\n    *   **Event Depicted:** The arrival of Dr. William Brydon at Jalalabad, the sole European survivor of a 16,500-strong column from the 1842 retreat from Kabul.\n    *   **Historical Date:** January **1842**, during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (Painted in 1874)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** The aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman.\n    *   **Historical Date:** November 5, **1854**, during the Crimean War.\n\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (Painted in 1880)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** The Battle of Rorke's Drift.\n    *   **Historical Date:** January 22–23, **1879**, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (Painted in 1882)\n    *   **Event Depicted:** The death of Lieutenant Robert Elwes at the Battle of Laing's Nek.\n    *   **Historical Date:** January 28, **1881**, during the First Boer War.\n\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (Painted in 1893)\n    *   **Event Depicted:** The Desert Column of the Gordon Relief Expedition.\n    *   **Historical Date:** January **1885**, during the Mahdist War in Sudan.\n\n*   ***The Charge of the 21st Lancers at Omdurman***\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** A famous cavalry charge during the Battle of Omdurman.\n    *   **Historical Date:** September 2, **1898**, during the Mahdist War.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Historical Dates**\nLet's list the years of the battles and events in chronological order to find the latest one:\n1.  **1815:** Battle of Quatre Bras / Battle of Waterloo\n2.  **1842:** Retreat from Kabul\n3.  **1854:** Battle of Inkerman\n4.  **1879:** Battle of Rorke's Drift\n5.  **1881:** Battle of Laing's Nek\n6.  **1885:** Gordon Relief Expedition\n7.  **1898:** Battle of Omdurman\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\nBy comparing the dates, it is clear that the Battle of Omdurman in **1898** is the latest historical event depicted in a major painting by Lady Butler from this list.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Distinguish Painting Date from Event Date:** It is crucial not to confuse the year a painting was created with the year the historical event it depicts occurred. For example, *Scotland for Ever!* was painted in 1881, but the Battle of Waterloo was in 1815.\n*   **Specificity of the Event:** The paintings often focus on a specific moment within a larger conflict (e.g., a specific regiment's action, a charge, or an aftermath), but the date of that specific battle is what matters.\n*   **Comprehensiveness:** The list includes her most famous works spanning her career, ensuring a high probability of including the one depicting the latest event. The Battle of Omdurman was a significant late-Victorian colonial battle, a natural subject for her.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Battle of Omdurman.\n\n<<<The Battle of Omdurman>>>"
