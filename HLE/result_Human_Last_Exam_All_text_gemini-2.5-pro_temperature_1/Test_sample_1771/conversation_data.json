    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti`.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form\n\n1.  **Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n2.  **Root:** `*seh₂g-`. This is the verbal root. The cognates provided (Hittite `sākizzi`, Latin `sāgīre`) confirm this root, meaning 'to track, seek out, perceive'.\n3.  **Structure:** The form is a present tense verb.\n    *   `*seh₂g-`: The root in e-grade.\n    *   `*-ie-`: A suffix used to form the present tense stem (a \"yo-present\").\n    *   `*-ti`: The 3rd person singular primary active ending.\n4.  **Phonology:**\n    *   `*s`: Voiceless alveolar sibilant.\n    *   `*e`: Mid front vowel.\n    *   `*h₂`: A laryngeal consonant. Its primary effect is \"a-coloring,\" meaning it changes an adjacent `*e` vowel to `*a`. Therefore, `*seh₂g-` was phonetically realized as `*sāg-`.\n    *   `*g`: Voiced velar stop.\n    *   `*t`: Voiceless dental stop.\n\nSo, the form going into the pre-Germanic stage is effectively `*sāgieti`.\n\n### Step 2: Trace into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\nSeveral major sound changes occur between late PIE and Proto-Germanic.\n\n1.  **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Consonant Shift):**\n    *   PIE `*g` (voiced stop) becomes PGmc `*k` (voiceless stop).\n    *   PIE `*t` (voiceless stop) becomes PGmc `*þ` (voiceless fricative).\n    *   PIE `*s` remains `*s` at the beginning of a word.\n2.  **Vowel Changes:**\n    *   PIE `*ā` (from `*eh₂`) becomes PGmc `*ō`.\n3.  **Morphological Changes (Verb System):**\n    *   The PIE `*-ie/o-` present tense verbs become Class 1 weak verbs in Germanic. The suffix marker for this class is `*-j-`.\n    *   The PIE 3sg ending `*-ti` becomes `*-þi` or `*-di` after Grimm's Law, and eventually simplifies to `*-iþ` in the 3sg present indicative for this verb class.\n4.  **Reconstruction of the PGmc form:**\n    *   Root: PIE `*sāg-` -> PGmc `*sōk-`.\n    *   Stem: This is a Class 1 weak verb, so the stem is `*sōkj-`.\n    *   3sg. Present Indicative Form: `*sōk-` + `*-j-` + `*-iþ` -> `*sōkiþ`. (The `*j` is often considered part of the stem and its effects are seen on the preceding vowel, but it is lost before the `*i` of the ending in the 3sg form). The infinitive would be `*sōkijaną`.\n\n**Proto-Germanic result:** `*sōkiþ`\n\n### Step 3: Trace into Daughter Languages\n\nFrom the Proto-Germanic form `*sōkiþ` (from stem `*sōkj-`), we trace the development into Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German. The key process affecting all three is **i-umlaut**, where the `*-j-` in the stem and/or the `*-i-` in the ending causes the back root vowel `*ō` to front.\n\n#### A. Old Norse (ON)\n\n1.  **I-umlaut:** The PGmc `*ō` is fronted by the following `/i/` or `/j/`. The result is `œ` (a front rounded vowel, /øː/).\n    *   `*sōk-` -> `*sœ̄k-`\n2.  **Ending:** The PGmc 3sg ending `*-iþ` regularly becomes `-r` in Old Norse.\n3.  **Result:** `*sōkiþ` -> `*sœ̄kiʀ` -> `sœ́kir`.\n\n**Old Norse result:** `sœ́kir`\n\n#### B. Old English (OE)\n\n1.  **I-umlaut:** The PGmc `*ō` is fronted and unrounded by the following `/i/` or `/j/`. The result is `ē`.\n    *   `*sōk-` -> `*sēk-`\n2.  **Palatalization:** The PGmc `*k`, when followed by a front vowel (like the newly formed `ē` or the original `j/i`), becomes the palato-alveolar affricate `ċ` (/tʃ/).\n    *   `*sēk-` -> `sēc-`\n3.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-eþ` or is syncopated to `-þ`.\n4.  **Result:** `*sōkiþ` -> `*sēkiþ` -> `sēceþ` (also written `sēċeþ`) or the contracted `sēcþ`.\n\n**Old English result:** `sēceþ` (or `sēcþ`)\n\n#### C. Old High German (OHG)\n\n1.  **Vowel Breaking:** Before other changes, PGmc `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   `*sōk-` -> `suok-` -> `suoh-` (spelling variant)\n2.  **Second (High German) Consonant Shift:** PGmc `*k` after a vowel becomes the voiceless fricative `hh` (/x/ or /xx/).\n    *   `suok-` -> `suohh-`\n3.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-it` in OHG.\n4.  **I-umlaut:** I-umlaut occurs in OHG, but it is later and less consistent across dialects than in OE or ON. The original form would not show it. The `*j` in the infinitive (`suohhen` from `*sōkijaną`) is preserved as a vowel `e`, and the 3sg form is constructed from the stem `suohh-` + the ending `-it`.\n5.  **Result:** `*sōkiþ` -> `suohhit`. (Later, i-umlaut would affect `uo` to produce `üe`, giving forms like `süehhit`, but `suohhit` is the classic form).\n\n**Old High German result:** `suohhit`\n\n### Final Summary of Developments\n\n*   **Proto-Indo-European:** `*seh₂gieti` (`*sāgieti`)\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkiþ`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœ́kir`\n*   **Old English:** `sēceþ` (or `sēcþ`)\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhit`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ\nOld Norse: sœ́kir\nOld English: sēceþ (or sēcþ)\nOld High German: suohhit>>>"
