    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB deep No-Limit Hold'em cash game.\n    *   **Rake:** Rake-free. This is a key detail. In a raked game, the most marginal hands become folds because the rake eats up the tiny profit margin. In a rake-free game, any hand with a slightly positive Expected Value (EV) is a correct open.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the best position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last post-flop, which allows you to realize your equity more effectively and open a very wide range of hands (typically 45-50%).\n    *   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size.\n    *   **Question:** Identify the *worst* suited jack (Jxs) that should be included in this opening range. \"Worst\" means the hand with the lowest profitability that is still a standard open.\n\n2.  **Ranking Suited Jacks:**\n    To find the worst suited jack, we first need to understand how they are ranked in terms of playability and profitability. All suited hands have the benefit of making flushes. The other key factors are high-card strength and connectedness (the ability to make straights).\n\n    *   **Premium/Strong Suited Jacks:** AJs, KJs, QJs. These are very strong hands, combining a high card with a jack and flush/straight potential.\n    *   **Strong Suited Connectors:** JTs. This is a premium suited connector, making the top end of many straights and strong flushes.\n    *   **Gapped Suited Connectors:** J9s, J8s, J7s. These hands are still very strong. As the gap between the Jack and the lower card increases, the straight potential decreases, making the hand slightly weaker. J9s is stronger than J8s, which is stronger than J7s.\n    *   **Weak Suited Jacks:** J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. These hands have very poor straight connectivity. Their value comes primarily from making a Jack-high flush or making top pair (Jack) with a very weak kicker.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Cutoff Point:**\n    We need to find the hand at the very bottom of this list that is still considered a standard open-raise from the button in our specified game.\n    *   A button opening range is very wide. In a rake-free setting, it's at its widest. GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solvers show that a button should open nearly all suited hands.\n    *   Let's compare the weakest candidates: J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    *   **J5s:** This hand has a slight edge over the others below it because the 5 can connect with low cards (A, 2, 3, 4) to make a \"wheel\" straight.\n    *   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These hands have progressively worse connectivity. Their low card offers very little value. Pairing a 4, 3, or 2 is rarely good, and the straight possibilities are minimal.\n    *   The primary value difference between J4s, J3s, and J2s is minuscule, but a hierarchy still exists. The lower the bottom card, the weaker the hand. Therefore, J2s is objectively the weakest hand in the entire Jxs category.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Given the aggressive nature of a button opening range, especially in a rake-free environment, GTO strategy dictates opening all suited jacks. The hand with the lowest high-card value (besides the Jack) and the worst connectivity is **J2s**. It is the last suited Jack to be added to the range and therefore the \"worst\" one that is still a profitable open-raise.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Rake is crucial:** If the question involved a typical live or online game with rake, the answer might change. The most marginal hands like J2s, J3s, etc., might become folds because the small profit they generate is negated by the rake.\n*   **Opponent Tendencies:** This analysis assumes a GTO vacuum. Against very aggressive 3-bettors in the blinds, you might tighten your range and fold the very bottom, including J2s. Conversely, against very passive opponents, you can open even wider.\n*   **Definition of \"Worst\":** The question asks for the worst hand you *should open*, implying it is a correct open, just the least profitable one among its peers. J2s fits this description perfectly.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
