    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, let's break down the definitions given in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a disk, a sphere, or more exotic spaces like the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. This is important to avoid trivial cases. Any nondegenerate continuum in a metric space has a cardinality of at least `c` (the cardinality of the continuum).\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the set of all points `q` in `X` for which there exists a *proper subcontinuum* of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space `X`. The set of all composants of `X` forms a partition of `X`.\n*   **Product of two nondegenerate continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X × Y` equipped with the product topology is also a continuum. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, so is `X × Y`.\n\nThe question asks for the **largest possible number** of a specific property (composants) of a space (`X × Y`) that can be constructed under given rules (`X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua).\n\n### Step 2: Key Theorems and Careful Points\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to connect the number of composants to the topological structure of the continuum. There are some crucial theorems in continuum theory that govern this relationship.\n\n1.  **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continua:**\n    *   A continuum `Z` is called **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. For example, the interval `[0, 1]` is decomposable because `[0, 1] = [0, 2/3] ∪ [1/3, 1]`.\n    *   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable. Examples include the pseudo-arc and the Knaster bucket-handle continuum.\n\n2.  **Number of Composants and Decomposability:** There is a direct link between these two concepts for metric continua.\n    *   **Theorem 1:** A metric continuum has **exactly one** composant if and only if it is decomposable. In a decomposable continuum, any two points can be connected by a proper subcontinuum.\n    *   **Theorem 2:** A metric continuum has **`c`** composants (where `c = 2^aleph_0` is the cardinality of the continuum) if and only if it is indecomposable.\n    *   **Careful Point:** For metric continua, the number of composants is not arbitrary. It's a dichotomy: the number is either 1 or `c`. There are no metric continua with, for instance, exactly 5 or a countably infinite number of composants.\n\n3.  **Decomposability of a Product Space:** The structure of the product space `X × Y` depends on the structure of `X` and `Y`.\n    *   **Theorem 3:** The product `X × Y` of two continua is **indecomposable** if and only if **both** `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n    *   **Corollary:** The product `X × Y` is **decomposable** if at least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\nWe want to find the largest possible number of composants for the product continuum `Z = X × Y`. Based on the theorems above, the possible number of composants for `Z` is either 1 or `c`. The largest of these is `c`. The task now is to show that this number is achievable.\n\n1.  **Goal:** To maximize the number of composants of `X × Y`, we need to make it have `c` composants.\n2.  **Condition for `c` composants:** According to Theorem 2, `X × Y` will have `c` composants if and only if it is an indecomposable continuum.\n3.  **Condition for `X × Y` to be indecomposable:** According to Theorem 3, `X × Y` is indecomposable if and only if both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable continua.\n4.  **Existence of required spaces:** The problem requires `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate. So, we must ask: do there exist nondegenerate indecomposable continua? Yes. A well-known example is the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a nondegenerate continuum that is indecomposable (and has several other remarkable properties).\n5.  **Construction:**\n    *   Let `X` be a pseudo-arc. It is a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Let `Y` be another pseudo-arc. It is also a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Consider their product `Z = X × Y`.\n6.  **Analysis of the constructed space:**\n    *   Since both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable, by Theorem 3, their product `Z = X × Y` is also an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Since `Z` is an indecomposable metric continuum, by Theorem 2, it has `c` composants.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** We have shown that it is possible to construct a product of two nondegenerate continua that has `c` composants. We also know that the only other possibility for the number of composants is 1 (which is achieved if, for example, `X = [0,1]` and `Y = [0,1]`, since their product, a square, is decomposable). Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is `c`.\n\n<<<c>>>"
