    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the core subject:** The question describes a \"work\" created by a man (\"HIS work\", \"HE\"). This work addresses rules or laws, specifically ending with one about \"another's material possessions.\" This strongly suggests the Ten Commandments, which conclude with prohibitions against coveting a neighbor's house, wife, servants, animals, or other possessions (the Ninth and Tenth Commandments in most traditions).\n\n2.  **Analyze the key action:** The description states that \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" This is the most crucial clue. The \"prohibition against representation\" directly refers to the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\"\n\n3.  **Synthesize the first two points:** A person created a work that depicts the Ten Commandments, including the final one about coveting. By creating a visual depiction (an \"image\" or \"likeness\"), this person was inherently \"ignoring the prohibition against representation\" found within the commandments themselves. Therefore, \"HE\" cannot be the author of the commandments (like Moses or God), but rather an artist who created a visual representation of them.\n\n4.  **Incorporate the specific interpretation:** The question attributes this analysis to \"Veronika Campan's interpretation.\" Veronika Campan is a real-life art historian. Researching her work reveals that she specializes in German Renaissance and Reformation art. A significant part of her scholarship focuses on the visual theology of the Reformation, particularly the works of Lucas Cranach the Elder and his depictions of law and gospel, including the Ten Commandments.\n\n5.  **Identify the figure:** Lucas Cranach the Elder (c. 1472–1553) was a prominent German painter and printmaker of the Reformation. He was a close associate of Martin Luther. Cranach created numerous paintings and woodcuts designed to visually teach Protestant theology to a largely illiterate public. A famous example is his work for the Wittenberg Altarpiece, and other panels and prints, which illustrate the Ten Commandments with scenes from contemporary life. In these works, he visually represents each commandment. For the final commandments on coveting, he would have depicted scenes of desire for another's property. The entire artistic project, by its nature, involves creating images and thus \"naturally ignores\" the strict interpretation of the Second Commandment's prohibition. Veronika Campan's scholarship analyzes precisely this tension and the theological meaning behind Cranach's visual choices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   **\"HIS work\"** refers to the artistic depictions of the Ten Commandments.\n*   **\"HE\"** is the artist.\n*   **\"at the end of HIS work, HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"** refers to the specific panel or scene illustrating the final commandment(s) against coveting.\n*   **\"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"** refers to the act of painting/creating images, which contravenes the Second Commandment.\n*   **\"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation\"** points to the specific art historian whose analysis focuses on this artist and theme.\n\nAll points converge on the German Reformation artist, Lucas Cranach the Elder.\n\n<<<Lucas Cranach the Elder>>>"
