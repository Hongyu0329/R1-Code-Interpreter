    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie \"Ovosodo\".\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the specific US city where the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves in the 1997 film \"Ovosodo\".\n\n2.  **Recall/Research the Film's Plot:** The film \"Ovosodo\" (Hard Boiled Egg) by Paolo Virzì primarily follows the life of the protagonist, Piero Mansani, in Livorno, Italy. A key secondary character is his best friend, Tommaso.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Character Tommaso's Arc:** Tommaso comes from a wealthy, intellectual family, contrasting with Piero's working-class background. Tommaso is portrayed as a restless and rebellious spirit. Throughout the film, he explores various paths, including traveling and music.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the \"Move to the US\" Event:** A significant event in the friendship and the plot is Tommaso's decision to leave Livorno and Italy to pursue his studies abroad. This is a turning point in the movie, highlighting the different paths the two friends take.\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific City:** To find the exact city, we need to refer to the film's script or detailed plot summaries. In the narrative, Tommaso announces he is leaving to study at a prestigious university in the United States. That university is specified as the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Protagonist vs. Secondary Character:** It's important to distinguish between the main character, Piero Mansani (played by Edoardo Gabbriellini), who stays in Livorno for most of the film, and his friend Tommaso (Marco Cocci), who is the one who moves.\n*   **Location Specificity:** The film explicitly mentions the destination. It's not just \"America\" or \"California\" in general; the city is named because of the university located there.\n*   **Character Motivation:** Tommaso's move to Berkeley is part of his character's journey of self-discovery and intellectual pursuit, which stands in contrast to Piero's more grounded, localized life experiences.\n\nBy following these steps and paying attention to the details of the plot, we can confidently determine the correct city.\n\n<<<Berkeley>>>"
