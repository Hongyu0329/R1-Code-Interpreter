    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Analyze the question step by step**\n\n1.  The user has provided a number sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\n2.  The goal is to find the pattern governing the sequence and determine the next number that should be in the parentheses.\n3.  We will test several common types of sequence patterns to find the correct one.\n\n**List all the careful points**\n\n1.  **Check for simple arithmetic progression:** Calculate the differences between consecutive terms. If the differences are constant, it's an arithmetic progression.\n2.  **Check for simple geometric progression:** Calculate the ratio between consecutive terms. If the ratio is constant, it's a geometric progression.\n3.  **Check for second-order differences:** If the first differences are not constant, calculate the differences of the differences. A constant second-order difference indicates a quadratic relationship.\n4.  **Check for complex recursive relationships:** The next term might be a function of the previous term(s), such as `a_n = k * a_{n-1} + C`, where C might also be a sequence.\n5.  **Check for patterns involving powers:** The terms might be related to powers of integers (e.g., n², n³, 2ⁿ).\n6.  **Be aware of patterns that don't start from the first term:** Sometimes, a rule only applies from the second or third term onwards.\n7.  **Verify the pattern:** Once a potential pattern is found, ensure it holds true for all the given numbers in the sequence.\n8.  **Perform calculations carefully:** Simple arithmetic errors can lead to the wrong conclusion.\n\n**Acquire the final answer with step by step analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Initial Sequence**\n    The given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\n*   **Step 2: Check for Simple Patterns**\n    *   Differences (First-order):\n        *   11 - 2 = 9\n        *   23 - 11 = 12\n        *   51 - 23 = 28\n        *   119 - 51 = 68\n        The differences (9, 12, 28, 68) are not constant, so it's not a simple arithmetic progression.\n    *   Ratios:\n        *   11 / 2 = 5.5\n        *   23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n        The ratios are not constant, so it's not a simple geometric progression.\n\n*   **Step 3: Explore Complex Recursive Relationships**\n    Let's test a relationship of the form `a_n = m * a_{n-1} + C_n`. Let's try `m=3`.\n    *   For the third term (`a_3 = 23`): `3 * a_2 = 3 * 11 = 33`. To get 23, we must subtract 10. So, `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`.\n    *   For the fourth term (`a_4 = 51`): `3 * a_3 = 3 * 23 = 69`. To get 51, we must subtract 18. So, `51 = 3 * 23 - 18`.\n    *   For the fifth term (`a_5 = 119`): `3 * a_4 = 3 * 51 = 153`. To get 119, we must subtract 34. So, `119 = 3 * 51 - 34`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the Pattern of the Subtracted Numbers**\n    We have found a consistent pattern starting from the third term: `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - k_n`.\n    The sequence of subtracted numbers, `k_n`, is: 10, 18, 34.\n    Let's find the pattern in this new sequence.\n\n*   **Step 5: Find the Pattern in the `k_n` Sequence**\n    Calculate the differences between the terms in the sequence (10, 18, 34):\n    *   18 - 10 = 8\n    *   34 - 18 = 16\n    The differences are 8 and 16. This is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2.\n\n*   **Step 6: Predict the Next Term in the `k_n` Sequence**\n    The next difference will be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n    Therefore, the next term in the `k_n` sequence will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\n\n*   **Step 7: Calculate the Next Term in the Original Sequence**\n    We can now find the missing term (`a_6`) using the established rule: `a_6 = 3 * a_5 - k_6`.\n    *   `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 357 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
