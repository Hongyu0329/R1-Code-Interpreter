    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**The System of Differential Equations:**\nLet $d=d(t)$ and $u=u(t)$. The system is given by:\n1.  $d' = 2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$\n2.  $u' = u^2(u-1)$\n\nWe are analyzing the system in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points are points $(u, d)$ where $d'=0$ and $u'=0$.\n\nFrom $u'=0$, we have $u^2(u-1) = 0$, which gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $0 = 2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0)$\n    $0 = 2d^2 \\implies d=0$.\n    So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $0 = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1)$\n    $0 = 2d^2 + 2d$\n    $0 = 2d(d+1) \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$ of the system. Let $f(u,d) = u^2(u-1)$ and $g(u,d) = 2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$.\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial f / \\partial u & \\partial f / \\partial d \\\\ \\partial g / \\partial u & \\partial g / \\partial d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ -3d+10ud-3u^2+4u^3 & 4d-3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic fixed point.\n\n*   **At (1, 0):** $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ -3+4 & -3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At (1, -1):** $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ 3-10-3+4 & -4-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Separatrix**\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are always separatrices. In this system, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\nThe stable manifold consists of trajectories that approach the saddle point as $t \\to \\infty$. The corresponding eigenvalue is $\\lambda_2=-2$. The eigenvector is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_2 I)v = 0$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 1-(-2) & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2-(-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThis gives $3v_u=0 \\implies v_u=0$. The eigenvector is tangent to the vertical direction $(0, 1)$. This corresponds to the line $u=1$. So, the stable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ is the line $u=1$.\n\nThe unstable manifold consists of trajectories that leave the saddle point (approaching it as $t \\to -\\infty$). The corresponding eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1=1$. The eigenvector is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_1 I)v = 0$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 1-1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThis gives $-6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is tangent to the direction $(1, -2)$. The slope of the unstable manifold at $(1, -1)$ is $-2$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the equation for the unstable manifold**\nWe look for a trajectory (an invariant curve) $d=h(u)$ that passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$ and has the correct tangent.\nLet's test a simple function. Consider the parabola $d = -u^2$.\n*   At $u=1$, $d = -1^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n*   The slope of this curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2(1)=-2$. This matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector.\n\nLet's verify if $d=-u^2$ is indeed a trajectory of the system. The slope of any trajectory is given by:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\nSubstitute $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side:\nNumerator: $2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u) = 2u^4 + (3u^3-5u^4) - u^3+u^4 = -2u^4 + 2u^3 = -2u^3(u-1)$.\nSo, the right-hand side becomes:\n$\\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$.\nThe left-hand side is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$.\nSince both sides are equal, $d=-u^2$ is an exact solution to the trajectory equation. This curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\nBeing the unstable manifold of the saddle point, the curve $d=-u^2$ is a fundamental separatrix of the system. It divides the phase plane into regions of distinct long-term behavior.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
