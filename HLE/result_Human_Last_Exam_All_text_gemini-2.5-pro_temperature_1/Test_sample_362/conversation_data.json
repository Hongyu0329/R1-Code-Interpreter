    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\nThe problem describes a Wittig reaction between two compounds:\n*   **The Carbonyl Compound:** Pivalaldehyde.\n    *   The prefix \"pival-\" refers to the pivaloyl group, which contains a tert-butyl group ((CH₃)₃C-).\n    *   The suffix \"-aldehyde\" indicates the presence of a -CHO functional group.\n    *   Therefore, the structure of pivalaldehyde is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n\n*   **The Wittig Reagent (Phosphorus Ylide):** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" indicates a triphenylphosphine group (PPh₃) bonded to another group, with phosphorus having a bonding number of 5, which corresponds to the ylide form P=C.\n    *   \"ethylidene\" refers to a two-carbon group with a double bond at the point of attachment, i.e., =CH-CH₃.\n    *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" is a substituent on the second carbon of the ethylidene group.\n    *   \"2-chlorophenyl\" is a phenyl ring with a chlorine atom at the ortho (position 2) position.\n    *   Combining these parts, the ylide structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where the chlorine is at position 2 of the phenyl ring.\n\n**2. Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. It involves the reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with a phosphorus ylide. The overall transformation can be thought of as an exchange of the doubly bonded oxygen atom of the carbonyl group with the doubly bonded carbon group of the ylide.\n\nThe general reaction is:\nR¹R²C=O + Ph₃P=CR³R⁴ → R¹R²C=CR³R⁴ + Ph₃P=O (triphenylphosphine oxide)\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Connectivity**\n\nApplying the general mechanism to our specific reactants:\n*   From pivalaldehyde, (CH₃)₃C-CHO, we get the (CH₃)₃C-CH= fragment.\n*   From the ylide, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(2-Cl-C₆H₄), we get the =CH-CH₂(2-Cl-C₆H₄) fragment.\n\nJoining these two fragments forms the new C=C double bond. The constitutional structure of the product is:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(2-Cl-C₆H₄)\n\n**4. Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Product (E/Z Isomerism)**\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the phosphorus ylide.\n*   **Stabilized ylides** (where the carbanion in the resonance form Ph₃P⁺-C⁻ is stabilized by an adjacent electron-withdrawing group, e.g., -C=O, -CN) typically yield the more stable **E-alkene** (trans) as the major product.\n*   **Unstabilized ylides** (where the carbanion is adjacent to hydrogen or alkyl groups) are more reactive and typically yield the **Z-alkene** (cis) as the major product under standard conditions (kinetic control).\n\nLet's analyze our ylide: Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(2-Cl-C₆H₄). The group attached to the ylidic carbon is a 2-chlorobenzyl group (-CH₂-Ar). This is an alkyl-type group and does not possess significant electron-withdrawing character to stabilize the adjacent carbanion. Therefore, this is an **unstabilized ylide**.\n\nSince the reaction involves an unstabilized ylide and an aldehyde, the major product will be the **Z-alkene**.\n\nTo assign the Z configuration, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the substituents on each carbon of the double bond:\n*   **On the first carbon of the double bond (from pivalaldehyde):** The substituents are a tert-butyl group (-C(CH₃)₃) and a hydrogen atom (-H). The tert-butyl group has higher priority.\n*   **On the second carbon of the double bond (from the ylide):** The substituents are a 2-chlorobenzyl group (-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)) and a hydrogen atom (-H). The 2-chlorobenzyl group has higher priority.\n\nIn the **Z-isomer**, the two higher-priority groups (tert-butyl and 2-chlorobenzyl) are on the same side of the double bond.\n\n**5. Name the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify the parent chain:** The longest carbon chain that includes the double bond has 5 carbons. The parent name is \"pentene\".\n    (CH₃)₃C–CH=CH–CH₂–(2-Cl-C₆H₄)\n2.  **Number the chain:** We number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant. Numbering from the end closer to the 2-chlorobenzyl group gives the double bond starting at C2.\n    ¹[CH₂–(2-Cl-C₆H₄)]–²[CH]=³[CH]–⁴[C(CH₃)₃]\n    So, it is a pent-2-ene.\n3.  **Identify and name the substituents:**\n    *   At position 1: a (2-chlorophenyl) group.\n    *   At position 4: two methyl groups (dimethyl).\n4.  **Assemble the name:** Combining the parts with the determined stereochemistry (Z) gives the final name.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\nIts structure is:\n```\n      H       C(CH3)3\n       \\     /\n        C = C\n       /     \\\n  Cl-Ph-CH2   H\n```\nwhere the two high-priority groups, 2-chlorobenzyl (-CH₂-Ph-Cl) and tert-butyl (-C(CH₃)₃), are on the same side of the double bond.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
