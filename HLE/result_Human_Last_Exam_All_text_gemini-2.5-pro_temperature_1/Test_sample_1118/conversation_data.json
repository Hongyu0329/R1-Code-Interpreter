    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific painting: a self-portrait by Curt Querner from 1933. It specifies the context: it was painted after he escaped the Gestapo. The key detail to find is the object he holds in his hand and its symbolic meaning as an item of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\nThe painting in question is Curt Querner's \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe), dated 1933. This confirms the year and the subject. Looking at images or descriptions of this painting is the next logical step.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the visual details of the painting.**\nIn this self-portrait, Querner presents himself with a very direct and defiant gaze. His face is tense and serious. In his hand, as the German title suggests, he is holding a simple tobacco pipe.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the symbolism in its historical context.**\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Context is Key.** 1933 was the year the Nazis and the Gestapo rose to power. Querner, known for his communist sympathies, was arrested. Painting this portrait after his release was an act of defiance in itself.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Symbolism of a Mundane Object.** The object is a pipe. A pipe is a common, personal item. In the context of persecution by an oppressive state, the act of holding onto and displaying such a personal, everyday object is a powerful statement.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Meaning of the Symbol.** By painting himself with his pipe, Querner is not showing a weapon or a political banner. Instead, he is asserting his own unbroken identity and individuality. The pipe symbolizes a return to his personal life, a quiet insistence on normality and personal freedom in the face of totalitarian control. It's a symbol of a spirit that refuses to be crushed, a quiet but firm form of resistance.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the final answer.**\nBased on the analysis of the painting's title, visual content, and historical context, the object Curt Querner holds in his hand as a symbol of resistance is a pipe.\n\n<<<A pipe>>>"
