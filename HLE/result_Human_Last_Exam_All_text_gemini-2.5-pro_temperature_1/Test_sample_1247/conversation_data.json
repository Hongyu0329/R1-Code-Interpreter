    "Answering this question requires analyzing permutations with a specific number of inversions and checking if they avoid a certain pattern.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:**\n    *   We are looking for the number of permutations of length \\(n=333\\).\n    *   These permutations must have exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions.\n    *   These permutations must avoid the pattern \\(1324\\).\n    *   The notation is \\(av_{n}^k(\\rho)\\), so we need to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\n2.  **Understand the concepts:**\n    *   A **permutation** \\(\\pi\\) of length \\(n\\) is an arrangement of the numbers \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\).\n    *   An **inversion** in \\(\\pi\\) is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)\\).\n    *   A permutation \\(\\pi\\) **avoids the pattern 1324** if there are no indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\).\n\n3.  **Analyze permutations with a small number of inversions:**\n    *   The number of inversions \\(k=3\\) is very small compared to the length of the permutation \\(n=333\\).\n    *   Permutations with few inversions are \"close\" to the identity permutation \\((1, 2, ..., n)\\). The identity permutation itself has 0 inversions and is 1324-avoiding.\n    *   The elements \\(\\pi(i)\\) that are not in their natural position \\(i\\) (i.e., \\(\\pi(i) \\neq i\\)) are few and typically localized. We call the set of these indices the \"support\" of the permutation relative to the identity.\n    *   A crucial observation: If a permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains a 1324 pattern, i.e., there exist \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) with \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\), then the pair of indices \\((i_2, i_3)\\) is an inversion in \\(\\pi\\), because \\(i_2 < i_3\\) and \\(\\pi(i_2) > \\pi(i_3)\\).\n\n4.  **Classify permutations with 3 inversions:**\n    For a large \\(n\\), permutations with 3 inversions can be classified by the structure of their support. The support is either a single block of consecutive integers or is composed of disjoint blocks.\n    *   **Case 1: The support is a single consecutive block.** The permutation is of the form \\((1, ..., i-1, \\pi', i+m, ...)\\) where \\(\\pi'\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{i, ..., i+m-1\\}\\) with 3 inversions. The minimal length \\(m\\) for a permutation to have 3 inversions is 3.\n        *   **m=3:** The only permutation of \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) with 3 inversions is \\(321\\). This corresponds to permutations of the form \\(\\pi_A = (..., i+2, i+1, i, ...)\\).\n        *   **m=4:** The permutations of \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) with 3 inversions are \\(1432, 2341, 2413, 3142, 4123\\). (Note: \\(3214\\) is not a permutation of \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) but \\((3,2,1)\\) acting on \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) followed by 4).\n            *   \\(\\pi_B\\) from \\(\\sigma=1432\\): \\((..., i, i+3, i+2, i+1, ...)\\)\n            *   \\(\\pi_C\\) from \\(\\sigma=2413\\): \\((..., i+1, i+3, i, i+2, ...)\\)\n            *   \\(\\pi_D\\) from \\(\\sigma=3142\\): \\((..., i+2, i, i+3, i+1, ...)\\)\n            *   \\(\\pi_E\\) from \\(\\sigma=4123\\): \\((..., i+3, i, i+1, i+2, ...)\\)\n            *   \\(\\pi_F\\) from \\(\\sigma=2341\\): \\((..., i+1, i+2, i+3, i, ...)\\)\n    *   **Case 2: The support consists of disjoint blocks.**\n        *   **inv=1 + inv=1 + inv=1:** Three disjoint transpositions of adjacent elements, like \\((..., i+1, i, ..., j+1, j, ..., k+1, k, ...)\\).\n        *   **inv=1 + inv=2:** One adjacent transposition and one block with 2 inversions. A block with 2 inversions acting on 3 elements can be \\(231\\) or \\(312\\). e.g., \\((..., i+1, i, ..., k+1, k+2, k, ...)\\).\n\n5.  **Check each class for the 1324 pattern:**\n    A detailed analysis shows that if the support of the permutation is not at one of the ends of \\(\\{1, ..., n\\}\\), a 1324 pattern can usually be constructed. For \\(n=333\\), we have plenty of elements before and after the support to form a pattern. The permutations that avoid 1324 are the \"boundary\" cases.\n\n    *   **Type A (\\(321\\)):** Avoids 1324 if \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-2\\).\n        1.  \\((3, 2, 1, 4, 5, ...)\\)\n        2.  \\((1, 2, ..., n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\)\n    *   **Type B (\\(1432\\)):** The boundary case \\(i=n-3\\) results in the permutation \\((1, ..., n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\). This is the same permutation as case A2. So, no new permutations.\n    *   **Type C (\\(2413\\)):** Avoids 1324 if \\(i=n-3\\).\n        3.  \\((1, 2, ..., n-4, n-2, n, n-3, n-1)\\)\n    *   **Type D (\\(3142\\)):** Boundary cases contain the 1324 pattern for \\(n \\ge 5\\). So, 0 avoiding permutations.\n    *   **Type E (\\(4123\\)):** Avoids 1324 if \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-3\\).\n        4.  \\((4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...)\\)\n        5.  \\((1, 2, ..., n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1)\\)\n    *   **Type F (\\(2341\\)):** Avoids 1324 if \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-3\\).\n        6.  \\((2, 3, 4, 1, 5, ...)\\)\n        7.  \\((1, 2, ..., n-4, n-2, n-1, n, n-3)\\)\n    *   **Disjoint supports (Case 2):** A detailed check shows that these permutations have a 1324 pattern unless they are of a specific structure, combining blocks at the very beginning and very end of the permutation.\n        *   inv=2 block at the start, inv=1 block at the end:\n            8.  \\((2, 3, 1, 4, ..., n, n-1)\\) (from \\(\\sigma_1=231, \\sigma_2=21\\))\n            9.  \\((3, 1, 2, 4, ..., n, n-1)\\) (from \\(\\sigma_1=312, \\sigma_2=21\\))\n        *   inv=1 block at the start, inv=2 block at the end:\n            10. \\((2, 1, 3, ..., n-2, n, n-3)\\) (from \\(\\sigma_1=21, \\sigma_2=231\\))\n            11. \\((2, 1, 3, ..., n, n-2, n-1)\\) (from \\(\\sigma_1=21, \\sigma_2=312\\))\n\n6.  **Count the avoiding permutations:**\n    Since \\(n=333\\) is large enough, all these boundary cases are distinct and valid. Summing them up:\n    *   Type A: 2 permutations\n    *   Type C: 1 permutation\n    *   Type E: 2 permutations\n    *   Type F: 2 permutations\n    *   Type H (disjoint): 4 permutations\n    Total = 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 11.\n\nThe number of such permutations is independent of \\(n\\) for \\(n\\) large enough (\\(n \\ge 6\\)).\n\nFinal list of the 11 types of permutations:\n1.  `(3,2,1,4,5,...,n)`\n2.  `(1,2,...,n-3,n,n-1,n-2)`\n3.  `(1,2,...,n-4,n-2,n,n-3,n-1)`\n4.  `(4,1,2,3,5,...,n)`\n5.  `(1,2,...,n-4,n,n-3,n-2,n-1)`\n6.  `(2,3,4,1,5,...,n)`\n7.  `(1,2,...,n-4,n-2,n-1,n,n-3)`\n8.  `(2,3,1,4,...,n,n-1)`\n9.  `(3,1,2,4,...,n,n-1)`\n10. `(2,1,3,...,n-2,n,n-3)`\n11. `(2,1,3,...,n,n-2,n-1)`\n\nAll these have 3 inversions and avoid the 1324 pattern.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
