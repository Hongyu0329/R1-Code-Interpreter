    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C.\n\n### Step 1: Relate the Néron-Severi group of X to the Jacobian of C\n\nLet C be a smooth projective curve of genus $g=3$. Let $X = C^{(15)}$ be its 15th symmetric power, which is the variety of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. The dimension of X is 15.\n\nThere is a natural map, the Abel-Jacobi map, from the symmetric power to the Jacobian variety of the curve:\n$u_d: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$\nwhich sends an effective divisor $D$ of degree $d$ to the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D - dP_0)$ in $J(C) = Pic^0(C)$, where $P_0$ is a fixed base point on C. The image variety is isomorphic to $Pic^d(C)$, which as a variety is isomorphic to $J(C)$.\n\nThe structure of this map depends on the relation between the degree $d$ and the genus $g$.\nIn our case, $d=15$ and $g=3$. We check the condition $d > 2g-2$.\n$15 > 2(3) - 2 = 4$.\nSince the degree $d=15$ is greater than $2g-2=4$, any line bundle $L$ of degree 15 on C is non-special. This means its first cohomology group vanishes: $h^1(C, L) = 0$.\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem, the dimension of the space of global sections is:\n$h^0(C, L) = \\deg(L) - g + 1 = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13$.\n\nThe fiber of the Abel-Jacobi map $u_{15}$ over a point corresponding to a line bundle $L$ is the projective space of effective divisors linearly equivalent to $L$, which is the complete linear system $|L| \\cong \\mathbb{P}^{h^0(C,L)-1}$.\nSince $h^0(C,L)=13$ is constant for all line bundles of degree 15, all fibers are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\nThis means that $X = C^{(15)}$ is a projective bundle over $J(C)$ (more precisely, over $Pic^{15}(C) \\cong J(C)$), with the fibers being isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\n\nFor a variety $E$ that is a $\\mathbb{P}^n$-bundle over a base variety $B$, the rank of the Néron-Severi group (the Picard number $\\rho$) is given by:\n$\\rho(E) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\nThe additional generator for the Néron-Severi group of $E$ comes from the hyperplane class of the fibers.\n\nApplying this to our problem, we have $X=C^{(15)}$ as a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over $J(C)$. Therefore,\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, $\\rho(J(C))$.\n\n### Step 2: Find the smallest possible rank of NS(J(C))\n\nThe Jacobian $J(C)$ of a genus 3 curve is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. The Néron-Severi group of any abelian variety is non-trivial, as it always contains the class of the polarizing divisor (the theta divisor). Thus, $\\rho(J(C)) \\ge 1$.\n\nFor a *generic* curve C of genus $g$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is simple and has the minimum possible number of endomorphisms, namely $End(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. These are the \"multiplication-by-n\" maps. The Rosati involution (induced by the principal polarization) acts as the identity on $\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, the group of symmetric endomorphisms is also $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of such a Jacobian is the rank of this group, which is 1.\n$\\rho(J(C)) = \\text{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 1$.\n\nThe locus of curves in the moduli space $M_3$ whose Jacobians have more endomorphisms than $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a proper, lower-dimensional subvariety. Thus, a generic genus 3 curve has a Jacobian with $\\rho(J(C))=1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1.\nThis gives the smallest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$:\n$\\min \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\min \\rho(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the largest possible rank of NS(J(C))\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of a $g$-dimensional abelian variety $A$, $\\rho(A)$, is bounded above by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A)$. For an abelian variety, $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$. So, $\\rho(A) \\le g^2$.\nFor our case, $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional abelian variety, so $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\nA classical result states that for a $g$-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety $A$, the maximum rank $\\rho(A) = g^2$ is achieved if and only if $A$ is isogenous to the $g$-fold self-product of an elliptic curve $E$ with complex multiplication (CM), i.e., $A \\sim E^g$.\n\nSo, the question becomes: does there exist a genus 3 curve $C$ such that its Jacobian $J(C)$ is isogenous to $E^3$ for some CM elliptic curve $E$?\nThe answer is yes. A well-known example is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation:\n$C: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$.\nThis is a smooth non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian, $J(C)$, is known to be isogenous to the product of three copies of the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - x$. This elliptic curve has complex multiplication by the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\nSo, for the Fermat quartic curve, $J(C) \\sim E^3$, and its Néron-Severi rank achieves the maximum possible value:\n$\\rho(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 9.\nThis gives the largest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$:\n$\\max \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\max \\rho(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Validity of the formula $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$**: This is crucial. It holds because for $d=15$ and $g=3$, we have $d > 2g-2$, which ensures that $C^{(d)}$ is a projective bundle over $J(C)$ with constant fiber dimension. For smaller $d$, the formula for $\\rho(C^{(d)})$ is different and more complex.\n2.  **Rank of NS group of an abelian variety**: The rank $\\rho(A)$ is the rank of the group of symmetric endomorphisms $End^s(A)$. For a generic Jacobian, this group is $\\mathbb{Z}$, giving $\\rho=1$.\n3.  **Maximum rank**: The upper bound $\\rho(A) \\le g^2$ is fundamental. The existence of a curve whose Jacobian achieves this bound is key to finding the maximum. The Fermat curve serves as an explicit example.\n4.  **Generic vs. Special Curves**: The rank of the Néron-Severi group is not constant over the moduli space of curves. Generic curves provide the minimum, while very special curves (often with large automorphism groups or whose Jacobians have complex multiplication) provide the maximum.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   The smallest possible rank of $NS(X)$ corresponds to a generic genus 3 curve C, for which $\\rho(J(C))=1$. This yields $\\rho(X) = 1+1=2$.\n*   The largest possible rank of $NS(X)$ corresponds to a special genus 3 curve C (like the Fermat quartic), for which $\\rho(J(C))$ achieves the maximum possible value of $3^2=9$. This yields $\\rho(X) = 9+1=10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2. The largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
