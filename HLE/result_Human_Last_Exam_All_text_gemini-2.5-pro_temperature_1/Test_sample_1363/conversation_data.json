    "An analysis of the question requires understanding the core techniques of each dance style mentioned, specifically concerning the execution of a \"reverse turn\" and the concept of \"overturning\" it.\n\n**Step 1: Define \"Reverse Turn\" and \"Overturn\"**\nA \"Reverse Turn\" is a standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left. \"Overturning\" means to execute more rotation than is standard for the figure. The key part of the question is identifying the dance where this overturning is \"impossible... without disregarding the technique.\" This implies that in one specific dance, the fundamental principles are so rigid that adding extra rotation breaks the very definition of how movement in that dance is supposed to be performed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each dance style based on its core technique.**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:** These four dances belong to the \"swing\" category of ballroom dance.\n    *   **Core Technique:** Their technique is characterized by continuous, flowing movement, pendulum swing in the legs and body, rise and fall, and body sway. These elements work together to create momentum that travels down the line of dance.\n    *   **Turning Mechanism:** Turns are executed progressively over several steps, using body rotation (CBM - Contrary Body Movement) and sway to facilitate the turn. The feet swing into place.\n    *   **Overturning a Reverse Turn:** In these swing dances, overturning a reverse turn is a common and often necessary variation. Dancers can use more sway, more body turn, and adjust their foot placement to achieve extra rotation, for example, to navigate a corner on the dance floor. While it requires skill, it is an extension of the existing technique, not a violation of it. The principles of swing, sway, and flow are still applied, just to a greater degree. Therefore, it is possible to overturn a reverse turn in these dances without fundamentally disregarding the technique.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:**\n    *   **Core Technique:** Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. It is a \"staccato\" dance. Key technical points include:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept flat, with bent knees maintaining a constant level.\n        *   **No Sway:** Body sway as seen in the swing dances is not used.\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, clipped, and precise.\n        *   **Footwork:** Feet are picked up and placed, not swung. There is a sense of \"marching\" or \"stalking.\" When feet come together, they often \"collect\" rather than close with weight change.\n    *   **Turning Mechanism:** Turns in Tango are executed more like sharp swivels or pivots. The foot placement for each step is extremely precise to allow for the clipped, staccato turn. For example, in an Open Reverse Turn, the leader's second step (RF) is placed to the side and slightly back, a very specific position that facilitates the exact amount of turn required.\n    *   **Overturning a Reverse Turn:** If one were to attempt to overturn a Tango reverse turn, it would require adding more rotation than the precise foot placements allow. To achieve this extra rotation, a dancer would be forced to introduce a swinging action with the leg and foot, use body sway, or introduce a flowing momentumâ€”all of which are direct violations of the core Tango technique. The sharp, staccato character would be lost, and the movement would cease to be \"Tango.\" The precise collection and placement of feet would be impossible, leading to a loss of balance and a breakdown of the figure's mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\nWhile overturning is a possible and accepted variation in the swing dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), doing so in Tango requires abandoning its fundamental technical principles (staccato action, no swing, no sway). Therefore, it is in the European Tango that it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
