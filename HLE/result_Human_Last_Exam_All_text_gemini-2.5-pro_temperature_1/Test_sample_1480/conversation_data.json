    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**\n    *   **System Type:** Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS).\n    *   **Given Value 1:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This value, `Phi_k(x′)`, represents the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule for a specific input `x'`.\n    *   **Given Value 2:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This value represents the membership degree of a specific point `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` (the \"THEN\" part) of the k-th rule.\n    *   **Required Operation:** Use a \"t-norm operation\".\n\n2.  **Understand the Fuzzy Inference Process**\n    In a fuzzy rule-based system (like Mamdani or TSK), the overall output of a single rule is determined by combining the firing strength of its \"IF\" part with the membership function of its \"THEN\" part. This combination step is called fuzzy implication, and it is almost always performed using a t-norm operator. The result gives the \"activated\" or \"fired\" consequent fuzzy set for that rule.\n\n3.  **Context of Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Sets (IT3 FS)**\n    *   An IT3 FS is a highly complex type of fuzzy set where membership grades themselves are Interval Type-2 fuzzy sets. This means that any calculation, including firing strength and membership values, would typically result in an interval of intervals, requiring four separate calculations for the lower and upper bounds of the lower and upper memberships.\n    *   However, the question provides single crisp numbers (`0.7` and `0.9`). This is a strong indication that the problem has been simplified to focus on the fundamental operation, or we are being asked to calculate just one of the many values that would be computed in a full IT3 FLS.\n    *   Therefore, we can treat this as a Type-1 fuzzy logic problem for the purpose of the calculation, as the core operation remains the same.\n\n4.  **Applying the T-Norm Operation**\n    *   A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logical \"AND\". The two most common t-norms used in fuzzy systems are:\n        1.  **Minimum (min):** `t-norm(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n        2.  **Algebraic Product (product):** `t-norm(a, b) = a * b`\n    *   The question asks for the \"rule activation level\" by applying a t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership value. This corresponds to the fuzzy implication step.\n    *   The standard and most common t-norm used for this purpose is the **minimum** operator.\n\n5.  **Calculation**\n    *   **Antecedent Firing Strength:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n    *   **Consequent Membership:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n    *   **T-norm (using minimum):** `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   **Result:** `0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of \"Rule Activation Level\":** This term can sometimes refer only to the antecedent firing strength (`Phi_k(x′)`). However, the explicit instruction to \"use a t-norm operation\" with two provided values makes it clear that a combination of the two values is required.\n2.  **Simplification of IT3 FS:** The problem's context is IT3 FS, but the provided data is simple (crisp numbers). One must recognize this is a simplified version of the problem and apply the fundamental fuzzy operation without getting lost in the full complexity of IT3 FS theory.\n3.  **Choice of T-Norm:** While the minimum operator is the standard choice, another valid t-norm is the algebraic product, which would yield `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`. In the absence of specific instructions, the minimum operator is the conventional choice for this type of problem.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe rule activation level, in the context of firing a rule's consequent, is calculated by applying a t-norm to the antecedent's firing strength and the consequent's membership degree.\n\n*   Activation = t-norm(`Phi_k(x′)`, `μG_k_j(y_j)`)\n*   Using the standard minimum t-norm:\n*   Activation = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   Activation = `0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
