    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define a Coordinate System and Place the First Cube**\n\nTo analyze the problem geometrically, we first establish a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard position. We can define Cube A as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\nThis is a unit cube with one vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its edges aligned with the coordinate axes. Its side length is 1, and its volume is `1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Shift and Place the Second Cube**\n\nThe problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to the first one by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n\n*   **Main Diagonal:** For Cube A in our chosen position, the main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Interpreting the Shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most commonly interpreted in such problems to mean a displacement by a vector that is 1/2 times the main diagonal vector.\n    *   Shift vector **s** = (1/2) * **d** = 1/2 * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n*   **Position of Cube B:** Since Cube B is identical to Cube A but shifted by the vector **s**, every point in Cube B is shifted by (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) from its original position in Cube A. Therefore, Cube B is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Region of Intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the conditions for *both* Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we find the intersection of the coordinate ranges for each dimension.\n\n*   **x-dimension:** We need the values of x that are in both the interval `[0, 1]` (from Cube A) and `[1/2, 3/2]` (from Cube B). The overlap is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **y-dimension:** We need the values of y that are in both `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`. The overlap is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **z-dimension:** We need the values of z that are in both `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`. The overlap is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nSo, the intersection is a region defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n\nThe region of intersection is itself a cube. We can find its side lengths from the ranges calculated in the previous step.\n\n*   Side length in x-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in y-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in z-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of the \"Shift\":** The most critical point is interpreting the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The interpretation used here (a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)) is standard for such problems and leads to a simple, rational answer. An alternative interpretation (a shift of distance 1/2 in the direction of the diagonal) would result in an irrational and much more complex answer, which is unlikely to be the intention.\n2.  **Coordinate System Choice:** Placing the first cube at `[0, 1]^3` simplifies the calculations for the coordinates of both the shifted cube and the intersection.\n3.  **Intersection of Ranges:** The intersection of two axis-aligned boxes is another axis-aligned box. Its dimensions are found by intersecting the corresponding 1D intervals. The intersection of intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` is `[max(a, c), min(b, d)]`.\n4.  **Geometric Intuition:** The corner of the second cube (the one that was at the origin) is moved to (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), which is the exact center of the first cube. The intersection is the octant of the first cube that lies in the positive direction from its center. Since a unit cube has a volume of 1, this octant has a volume of 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
