    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which Beatles song starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology**\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. In a major key, it's a major chord (represented by the Roman numeral I). In a minor key, it's a minor chord (represented by i).\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is the specific chord in question. In a major key, the naturally occurring chord on the fifth degree is major (V). A minor fifth chord (v) would be a \"borrowed\" chord, often taken from the parallel minor key. In a natural minor key, the chord on the fifth degree is naturally a minor chord (v).\n*   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct and immediate change from one chord to the next, right at the beginning of the song.\n\nSo, we are looking for a song that starts with one of two possible progressions:\n1.  **i → v:** A minor tonic chord moving to a minor fifth chord (e.g., in the key of A minor, this would be an A minor chord moving to an E minor chord).\n2.  **I → v:** A major tonic chord moving to a minor fifth chord (e.g., in the key of C major, this would be a C major chord moving to a G minor chord). This is less common.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm and Analyze Candidate Songs**\n\nLet's consider Beatles songs that are in a minor key or feature prominent minor chords in their introductions.\n\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\":** The song is in E minor. The tonic chord is E minor (i). However, the song famously starts with the string section playing a C major chord (the VI chord) before moving to the E minor tonic chord. This is a VI → i progression, not a i → v progression.\n*   **\"Michelle\":** The verses are in the key of F minor. The tonic chord is F minor (i). The fifth note of the F minor scale is C, and the minor fifth chord is C minor (v). The first vocal line, \"Michelle, ma belle,\" is sung over an F minor chord followed by a C minor chord. This is a perfect i → v progression. However, the question asks which *song* starts this way. The song actually begins with a solo guitar instrumental intro with a descending bassline; the vocal part with this chord change comes in after about 8 seconds. Therefore, the song doesn't technically *start* with this jump.\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\":** This song is from the album *A Hard Day's Night*. Let's analyze its opening.\n    *   The song starts immediately with a distinct acoustic guitar riff.\n    *   The first chord played is **A minor (Am)**.\n    *   The second chord played is **E minor (Em)**.\n    *   The main key of the song's verses is A minor.\n    *   In the key of A minor, the tonic chord (i) is **A minor**.\n    *   The fifth note of the A minor scale is E. The minor fifth chord (v) is **E minor**.\n    *   Therefore, the song starts with a literal and immediate jump from the tonic (A minor) to the minor fifth chord (E minor). This perfectly matches the question's criteria.\n\n**Step 3: List Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Defining \"Starts With\":** The most crucial point is interpreting \"starts with\" as the very first musical sound of the song. The intro of \"Things We Said Today\" is the i → v progression itself, whereas the intro of \"Michelle\" is a different, more complex passage that precedes the i → v progression under the vocal line.\n2.  **Distinguishing Major vs. Minor Fifth:** It's important to differentiate between the common major V chord (like the E major in \"I'll Be Back\") and the less common minor v chord (the E minor in \"Things We Said Today\"). The minor quality gives the progression its unique, plaintive sound.\n3.  **Correct Key Identification:** Correctly identifying the song's key is essential to determine which chord is the tonic. \"Things We Said Today\" is clearly centered around A minor in its verses and intro.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, \"Things We Said Today\" is the song that fits the description precisely. It begins immediately with its defining guitar riff, which is a direct chord jump from the tonic (A minor) to the minor fifth chord (E minor).\n\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
