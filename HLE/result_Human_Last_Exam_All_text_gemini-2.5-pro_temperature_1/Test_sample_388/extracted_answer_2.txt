The pharmacist should counsel Allison that taking Excedrin, which contains aspirin (an NSAID), while also taking Fluoxetine (an SSRI) increases the risk of stomach bleeding. For future headaches, a safer option would be a product containing only acetaminophen, such as Tylenol. She should also be advised to speak with her doctor if her headaches continue, as they could be a side effect of her medication or a sign of migraines.
