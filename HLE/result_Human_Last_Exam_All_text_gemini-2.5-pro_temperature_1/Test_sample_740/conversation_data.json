    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral Equation**\n\nThe given equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy, \\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq 1$\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, of the form $u(x) = f(x) + \\lambda \\int_a^b K(x, y) u(y) dy$.\nHere, the inhomogeneous term is $f(x) = 1$, and the kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Kernel**\n\nThe kernel can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: $a^n - b^n = (a-b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + \\dots + b^{n-1})$.\nSo, the kernel is a polynomial in $x$ and $y$:\n$K(x, y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\dots + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of $x$ and functions of $y$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Form of the Solution**\n\nSubstitute the separable kernel back into the integral equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k\\right) u(y) dy$\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$\n\nLet's define the constants $c_k$ as the moments of the function $u(y)$:\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nThe solution $u(x)$ must then have the form:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\nThis shows that any solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial in $x$ of degree at most $n-1$.\n\n**Step 4: Derive a System of Linear Equations**\n\nTo find the unknown constants $c_k$, we substitute the expression for $u(y)$ back into the definition of $c_j$:\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j u(y) dy = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left(1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}\\right) dy$\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^{j + n - 1 - k} dy$\n$c_j = \\left[\\frac{y^{j+1}}{j+1}\\right]_0^1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\left[\\frac{y^{j+n-k}}{j+n-k}\\right]_0^1$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{j+n-k}$\n\nThis is a system of $n$ linear algebraic equations for the $n$ unknowns $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$. We can write this in matrix form as:\n$\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b} + \\lambda A \\mathbf{c} \\implies (I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$\nwhere:\n- $\\mathbf{c} = (c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1})^T$\n- $\\mathbf{b} = (1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots, 1/n)^T$, so $b_j = \\frac{1}{j+1}$\n- $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix.\n- $A$ is the $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ (with $j, k$ being 0-indexed rows and columns, respectively).\n\n**Step 5: Conditions for No Solution**\n\nThe linear system $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution if the determinant of the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is non-zero.\n$\\det(I - \\lambda A) \\neq 0$.\n\nIf $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$, the system may have either no solution or infinitely many solutions. This occurs when $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. Let $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $A$.\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which a unique solution may not exist are called the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, when $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value, the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the right-hand side $f(x)=1$ is orthogonal to all solutions of the corresponding homogeneous adjoint equation:\n$v(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(y, x) v(y) dy$\n\nThe orthogonality condition is $\\int_0^1 f(x) v(x) dx = 0$. Since $f(x)=1$, this becomes:\n$\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$.\n\nThe equation has **no solution** if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value and the orthogonality condition is **not** met, i.e., there exists an eigenfunction $v(x)$ of the adjoint equation for which $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 6: Analysis of the Adjoint Equation**\n\nThe adjoint kernel is $K(y,x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} y^{n-1-k}x^k$. Any solution $v(x)$ to the adjoint equation is also a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. The condition $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx \\neq 0$ means that the zeroth moment of $v(x)$, which is $d_0 = \\int_0^1 y^0 v(y) dy$, is non-zero.\nThe coefficients (moments) of $v(x)$ satisfy a homogeneous linear system. A non-trivial solution $v(x)$ exists if $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix governing that system, which turns out to be the same matrix $A$.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to this:\n1. Find the eigenvalues $\\mu$ of the matrix $A$ where $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n+j-k}$.\n2. For each eigenvalue $\\mu_i$, find the corresponding eigenfunction(s) $v_i(x)$ of the adjoint operator.\n3. If for any of these $v_i(x)$, we have $\\int_0^1 v_i(x) dx \\neq 0$, then $\\lambda_i = 1/\\mu_i$ is a value for which no solution exists.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\n\nThis analysis is general. For specific values of $n$, we can compute the eigenvalues.\n- **Case n=1:** $A$ is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix. $A_{00} = \\frac{1}{1+0-0}=1$. The only eigenvalue is $\\mu=1$. So $\\lambda=1/\\mu=1$. The adjoint eigenfunction is $v(x)=C$ (a constant). Then $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = C \\neq 0$. Thus, for $n=1$, there is no solution if $\\lambda=1$.\n- **Case n=2:** The matrix is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(A-\\mu I) = (1/2-\\mu)^2 - 1/3 = \\mu^2 - \\mu - 1/12 = 0$. The eigenvalues are $\\mu = \\frac{3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{6}$. The corresponding values of $\\lambda=1/\\mu$ are $\\lambda = -6 \\mp 4\\sqrt{3}$. For these eigenvalues, it can be shown that the corresponding adjoint eigenfunctions are not orthogonal to $f(x)=1$.\n\nIn the general case, the matrix $A$ is a non-singular Cauchy-type matrix. It can be shown that for any of its eigenvalues, the corresponding adjoint eigenfunction is not orthogonal to $f(x)=1$.\nTherefore, the equation has no solution if and only if $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ defined by $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n+j-k}$ for $j, k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\n<<<The values of λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A whose elements are given by A_jk = 1/(n+j-k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
