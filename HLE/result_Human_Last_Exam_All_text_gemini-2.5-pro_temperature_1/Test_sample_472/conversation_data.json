    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis and Meter Identification\nThe line is from Roman comedy (Plautus, *Mercator* 35). The default meter for dialogue in Plautus is the **iambic senarius**. This meter consists of six iambic feet (`S L`). However, Plautine meter is very flexible and allows for many substitutions. A pure iambic senarius has 12 syllables. We must first count the syllables in our line to see what modifications are needed.\n\n### Step 2: Syllabification and Elision\nFirst, we break the line into its natural syllables:\n`et | ti | bi | be | ne | es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\nThis gives 15 syllables.\n\nNext, we must check for **elision**. Elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel (or `-m`) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or `h`).\n*   In our line, `bene` ends in `-e` and `esse` begins with `e-`. This is a clear case for elision. The final `-e` of `bene` is dropped, and the words are pronounced as one: `benesse`.\n\nAfter elision, the line is read as: `et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male`.\nLet's count the syllables now:\n`et(1) ti(2)bi(3) be(4)nes(5)se(6) so(7)li(8) quom(9) si(10)bi(11) sit(12) ma(13)le(14)`\nThe line has 14 syllables. An iambic senarius has 6 feet and 12 positions. Having 14 syllables means there must be two **resolutions**, where a single long syllable (`L`) in the metrical pattern is \"resolved\" into two short syllables (`S S`).\n\n### Step 3: Determining Syllable Quantities\nWe determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S).\n*   A syllable is long by nature if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong.\n*   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (or by `x` or `z`).\n*   Otherwise, a syllable is short.\n\nLet's apply this to our elided line:\n*   `et`: The vowel `e` is short, but the syllable is \"closed\" by the consonant `t` and followed by another consonant (`t` in `tibi`). It is long by position. -> **L**\n*   `ti-bi`: The word `tibi` is known to have two short syllables. -> **S S**\n*   `be-nes-se` (from `benesse`):\n    *   `be-`: Open syllable with a short vowel. -> **S**\n    *   `nes-`: The vowel `e` is followed by `ss`. Long by position. -> **L**\n    *   `se`: Open syllable with a short vowel. -> **S**\n*   `so-li`: From `sōlus`. The `o` is naturally long. The final `i` is short. -> **L S**\n*   `quom`: This can be long or short in comedy. We will assume it is **long** here, as it is a closed syllable (`-m`) before a consonant (`s-`). -> **L**\n*   `si-bi`: The word `sibi` is known to have two short syllables. -> **S S**\n*   `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but the syllable is closed by `t` and followed by a consonant (`m` in `male`). Long by position. -> **L**\n*   `ma-le`: The word `male` is known to have two short syllables. -> **S S**\n\nThe sequence of quantities is: `L S S S L S L S L S S L S S`\n\n### Step 4: Applying Metrical Licenses and Parsing into Feet\nThe line must be parsed into 6 feet. The final foot of an iambic senarius must be an iamb (`S L`).\nOur line ends in `male` (`S S`), which is a pyrrhic, not an iamb. This presents a problem.\nTo solve this, we use a license called **Brevis in Longo**. This rule allows the final short syllable of an iambic word (a word with the pattern `S S`, like `male`) to be treated as long to fit the meter.\n*   Therefore, `male` (`S S`) is scanned as `S L`.\n\nWith this license, our sequence becomes: `L S S S L S L S L S S L S L`\nNow we can parse this 14-syllable sequence into 6 feet. We are looking for 4 feet of 2 syllables and 2 feet of 3 syllables (the resolutions).\n\nThe parsing that fits the rules of the iambic senarius is:\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti` -> **L S** (Trochee - a valid substitution for an iamb)\n*   **Foot 2:** `bi be nes` -> **S S L** (Anapest - a resolution of an iamb, `S(SL)`)\n*   **Foot 3:** `se so` -> **S L** (Iamb - the base foot)\n*   **Foot 4:** `li quom` -> **S L** (Iamb - this requires splitting `soli`)\n*   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` -> **S S L** (Anapest - another resolution)\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma le` -> **S L** (Iamb - using the *Brevis in Longo* license)\n\n### Final Answer\nThe scansion, with feet separated by spaces, is:\n\nL S S S L S L S L S S L S L\n\n<<<L S S S L S L S L S S L S L>>>"
