    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object and its Orientation**\n*   **The Object:** The tank is in the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   **The Orientation:** The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   **Key Symmetry Feature:** A regular icosahedron has a point of symmetry at its geometric center. This is also called inversion symmetry. This means for any point on the icosahedron, there is an identical point on the opposite side, equidistant from the center. A consequence of this is that the face opposite the base face is also an equilateral triangle, parallel to the base and at the top of the tank. The vertical line passing through the centers of the base and top faces is a 3-fold rotational axis of symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Water Level**\n*   **The Condition:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   **Applying Symmetry:** Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, a plane passing through this center will divide the total volume into two equal halves.\n*   **Conclusion:** For the tank to be half-filled, the water surface must be a horizontal plane that passes exactly through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Water Surface**\n*   **The Question:** The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with this central, horizontal plane.\n*   **Using Symmetry Properties:** The cutting plane is a plane of symmetry for the icosahedron in this orientation. It is horizontal and perpendicular to the vertical 3-fold axis of symmetry. When a regular polyhedron is sliced by one of its planes of symmetry, the resulting cross-section is a regular polygon.\n*   **Identifying the Polygon:** We need to figure out which regular polygon is formed.\n    1.  The vertical axis is a 3-fold rotational axis. This means the cross-section must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry. This narrows the possibilities to polygons with a number of sides that is a multiple of 3 (e.g., triangle, hexagon, nonagon).\n    2.  Let's consider the edges that the plane must cut. The plane separates the 12 vertices of the icosahedron into two groups: 6 vertices in the upper half (above the center) and 6 vertices in the lower half (below the center). The water surface is formed by the points where the plane intersects the edges that connect an upper vertex to a lower vertex.\n    3.  It is a known geometric property of the icosahedron that there are 6 such edges that \"zig-zag\" around the equator of the icosahedron (when oriented this way). The central plane cuts through the midpoints of these 6 edges.\n    4.  These 6 intersection points are equidistant from the center and are separated by equal angles (60 degrees) due to the symmetry. Connecting these 6 points forms a regular hexagon.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  **Orientation:** Recognizing that \"standing on a face\" establishes a vertical 3-fold axis of symmetry.\n2.  **Symmetry for Volume:** Correctly using the point symmetry of the icosahedron to deduce that the half-full level corresponds to a plane through the center.\n3.  **Cross-Section Shape:** Understanding that a plane of symmetry intersecting a regular polyhedron creates a regular polygon.\n4.  **Identifying the Specific Polygon:** Combining the knowledge of the 3-fold axis and the structure of the icosahedron's edges to identify the cross-section as a hexagon.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe water fills half the volume, so its surface is a plane through the icosahedron's center. The icosahedron rests on a face, so its vertical axis is a 3-fold symmetry axis. The water surface is therefore a horizontal plane perpendicular to this 3-fold axis. The cross-section of an icosahedron by a central plane perpendicular to a 3-fold axis is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
