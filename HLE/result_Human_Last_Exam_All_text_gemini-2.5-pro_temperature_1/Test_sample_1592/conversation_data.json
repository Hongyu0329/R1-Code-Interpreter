    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. It is situated on the south-east shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate coordinates are 51°29′ N, 78°46′ W.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nSince Waskaganish is in Quebec, we need to consider the provinces and territories that are geographically close to its location on James Bay.\n*   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario lies to the west and southwest of Waskaganish. The land border between Quebec and Ontario runs south from the bottom of James Bay. The western coast of James Bay is entirely within Ontario.\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut lies to the north. Importantly, Nunavut's territory includes all the islands within Hudson Bay and James Bay, such as Akimiski Island and Charlton Island.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** This province borders Quebec to the east, but this border is very far from Waskaganish.\n*   **New Brunswick:** This province borders Quebec to the south-southeast, also very far from Waskaganish.\n\nBased on this, the two main candidates for the closest province or territory are **Ontario** and **Nunavut**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Distance to Ontario vs. Nunavut**\nTo determine which is closer, we must compare the distance from Waskaganish to the nearest point in Ontario and the nearest point in Nunavut.\n\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** The closest part of Ontario is not across the main body of James Bay, but rather the land border that begins at the southern tip of the bay. Waskaganish is on Rupert Bay, an inlet very close to where the Quebec-Ontario land border begins. The distance from the community of Waskaganish to the Ontario border to the southwest is a relatively short distance over land and a small stretch of water. This distance is approximately 55 kilometers (about 34 miles).\n\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The closest part of Nunavut consists of the islands in James Bay. The nearest significant island belonging to Nunavut is Charlton Island, located northwest of Waskaganish. The distance from Waskaganish across the open water of James Bay to the southern shore of Charlton Island is approximately 70 kilometers (about 43 miles).\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy comparing the distances, the land border with the province of Ontario (approx. 55 km away) is closer to Waskaganish than the nearest island belonging to the territory of Nunavut (approx. 70 km away).\n\nTherefore, the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
