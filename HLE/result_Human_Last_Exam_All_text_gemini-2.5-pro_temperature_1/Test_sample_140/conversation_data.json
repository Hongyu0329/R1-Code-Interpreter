    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that will fit inside a cube of edge length 15.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe need to find the maximum number of `9 x 1 x 1` rectangular blocks that can be placed inside a `15 x 15 x 15` cube without overlapping.\n\n**2. Initial Upper Bound Calculation (Volume Method)**\nFirst, we can calculate a theoretical maximum by comparing the volumes of the cube and a single block. This number is an upper bound, as it assumes the blocks can be \"melted down\" and perfectly fill the cube's volume, which is not possible due to their rigid shape.\n\n*   Volume of the cube = `15 * 15 * 15 = 3375` cubic units.\n*   Volume of one block = `9 * 1 * 1 = 9` cubic units.\n*   Theoretical maximum number of blocks = `Volume of cube / Volume of block` = `3375 / 9 = 375`.\n\nSo, we know that we cannot fit more than 375 blocks. The actual number will likely be less due to wasted space.\n\n**3. Physical Packing Strategy (Partitioning the Cube)**\nTo find the true maximum, we need to consider how the blocks physically fit. Since the blocks and the cube are rectangular, the optimal packing strategy will involve aligning the blocks with the axes of the cube. We can solve this by systematically partitioning the `15 x 15 x 15` cube into smaller cuboids and packing each one as efficiently as possible.\n\nLet's use the dimensions of the block (`9 x 1 x 1`) and the cube (`15 x 15 x 15`). The key relationship is `15 = 9 + 6`. We can use this to slice the cube.\n\n**Method 1: Layer-by-Layer Slicing**\n\n*   **Step A: First Section**\n    *   Slice the `15 x 15 x 15` cube to create a `9 x 15 x 15` cuboid.\n    *   We can pack this section by aligning the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 9-unit dimension of the cuboid.\n    *   Number of blocks = `(9/9) * (15/1) * (15/1) = 1 * 15 * 15 = 225` blocks.\n    *   This leaves a `6 x 15 x 15` cuboid of remaining space.\n\n*   **Step B: Second Section**\n    *   In the remaining `6 x 15 x 15` space, we must orient the 9-unit length of the blocks along one of the 15-unit dimensions.\n    *   Let's take a slice of `6 x 9 x 15` from this space to pack.\n    *   Number of blocks = `(6/1) * (9/9) * (15/1) = 6 * 1 * 15 = 90` blocks.\n    *   This leaves a `6 x (15-9) x 15` = `6 x 6 x 15` cuboid of remaining space.\n\n*   **Step C: Third Section**\n    *   In the remaining `6 x 6 x 15` space, we must orient the 9-unit length of the blocks along the 15-unit dimension.\n    *   Let's take a slice of `6 x 6 x 9` from this space to pack.\n    *   Number of blocks = `(6/1) * (6/1) * (9/9) = 6 * 6 * 1 = 36` blocks.\n    *   This leaves a `6 x 6 x (15-9)` = `6 x 6 x 6` cuboid of remaining space.\n\n*   **Step D: Final Remaining Space**\n    *   The final remaining space is a `6 x 6 x 6` cube. Since the longest dimension is 6, which is less than the block's length of 9, no more blocks can be placed in this space.\n\n*   **Step E: Total Calculation**\n    *   Summing the blocks from each packed section gives the total.\n    *   Total = `225 + 90 + 36 = 351` blocks.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Volume vs. Packing:** The most common mistake is to simply divide the volumes (`3375 / 9 = 375`). This gives an incorrect answer because it ignores the geometric constraints of fitting solid shapes, which inevitably leads to some wasted space.\n2.  **Axis-Alignment:** For rectangular blocks in a rectangular container, the optimal packing is almost always achieved when the blocks are aligned with the container's axes. Non-aligned (\"tilted\") packings are rarely more efficient.\n3.  **Systematic Partitioning:** Breaking the larger volume into smaller, manageable sub-volumes is a reliable strategy. It is crucial that the partitions are handled correctly to account for all the space.\n4.  **Verification:** The volume of the packed blocks is `351 * 9 = 3159`. The total volume of the cube is `3375`. The wasted volume is `3375 - 3159 = 216`. Our method left a `6 x 6 x 6` empty space, whose volume is `6 * 6 * 6 = 216`. This consistency confirms the calculation is correct. Trying an alternative partitioning method (e.g., splitting the `15x15x15` cube into eight smaller cuboids based on `15=9+6`) also yields 351, further strengthening the result.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step physical packing analysis, we have filled the cube with three sets of blocks and are left with a space too small to fit any more.\n\n*   First set: 225 blocks\n*   Second set: 90 blocks\n*   Third set: 36 blocks\n\nThe total number of blocks is the sum of these sets.\nTotal = 225 + 90 + 36 = 351.\n\n<<<351>>>"
