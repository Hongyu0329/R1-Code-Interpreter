    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Connecting Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics**\n\n*   The question asks to use large deviation theorems (Boltzmann-Sanov, Cramer-Chernoff). These theorems describe the probability of rare events. In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the overwhelmingly most probable macrostate.\n*   The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem states that the probability of an empirical distribution being close to a distribution $Q$ is governed by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Maximizing the statistical entropy ($S = k_B \\log W$, where $W$ is the number of microstates) is equivalent to minimizing this KL divergence from a reference measure.\n*   Therefore, the problem of finding the equilibrium state using large deviation theory reduces to the standard statistical mechanics procedure of finding the distribution of particles among energy levels that maximizes the entropy, subject to physical constraints.\n\n**2. Defining Entropy for a Bose Gas (Photons)**\n\n*   **System:** A gas of photons (which are bosons) in a given volume.\n*   **Key Properties of Photons:**\n    *   They are indistinguishable particles.\n    *   Any number of photons can occupy the same quantum state.\n    *   The total number of photons is not conserved (they can be created and absorbed), which implies their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **Entropy Calculation:** Consider an energy level $\\epsilon_j$ with $g_j$ distinct quantum states (degeneracy). Let $n_j$ be the number of photons in this energy level. The number of ways to distribute these $n_j$ indistinguishable photons among the $g_j$ states is given by the Bose-Einstein counting formula:\n    $W_j = \\binom{n_j + g_j - 1}{n_j}$\n*   The total number of microstates for a given configuration $\\{n_1, n_2, ...\\}$ is $W = \\prod_j W_j$.\n*   The Boltzmann entropy is $S = k_B \\ln W$. Using Stirling's approximation for large $n_j$ and $g_j$, the entropy can be written as:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (n_j + g_j) \\ln(n_j + g_j) - n_j \\ln n_j - g_j \\ln g_j \\right]$\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy to Find the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\n*   The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the entropy $S$ subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy, $E = \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j$.\n*   We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The function to maximize is $\\mathcal{L} = S - \\alpha N - \\beta E$. Since photon number $N$ is not conserved, the multiplier $\\alpha$ (related to chemical potential) is zero. So we maximize $\\mathcal{L} = S - \\beta E$.\n*   Setting the derivative with respect to $n_j$ to zero, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_j} (S/k_B - \\beta E) = 0$, yields:\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j + g_j}{n_j}\\right) - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n*   Solving for the average occupation number per state, $f(\\epsilon_j) = n_j/g_j$, we get the famous **Bose-Einstein distribution** for photons:\n    $f(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1}$, where $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (E)**\n\n*   To find the total energy, we integrate the energy per particle multiplied by the number of particles over all possible energy states. We use the continuous density of states $D(\\epsilon)$ for photons in a volume $V$.\n*   **Density of States:** For photons (relativistic particles with two polarization states), the density of states is:\n    $D(\\epsilon) = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2$\n*   **Energy Integral:** The total mean energy $E$ is given by:\n    $E = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot D(\\epsilon) \\cdot f(\\epsilon) \\,d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\left(\\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1}\\right) \\,d\\epsilon$\n    $E = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\,d\\epsilon$\n*   **Evaluation:** This standard integral can be solved by substituting $x = \\beta \\epsilon$.\n    $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\,d\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \\,dx = \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}\\right)$\n*   **Final Result for Energy:** Substituting this back gives the equilibrium mean energy:\n    $E = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15 \\beta^4} = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V}{15 h^3 c^3} (k_B T)^4$\n    This is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy of black-body radiation, showing that $E \\propto T^4$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\n*   We can calculate the entropy using the thermodynamic relation for the grand potential, $\\Omega$. For a system with $\\mu=0$, $\\Omega = E - TS$.\n*   The grand potential can also be calculated from the grand canonical partition function, which for a photon gas yields the important relation:\n    $\\Omega = -pV = -\\frac{E}{3}$\n*   **Relating E, S, and T:** By equating the two expressions for $\\Omega$, we get:\n    $E - TS = -\\frac{E}{3}$\n    $TS = E + \\frac{E}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}E$\n*   **Final Result for Entropy:** The equilibrium entropy is therefore:\n    $S = \\frac{4E}{3T}$\n*   Substituting the expression for $E$ we found in Step 4:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3} T^3$\n    This shows that the equilibrium entropy of a photon gas is proportional to $T^3$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium values are derived by finding the most probable macroscopic state, which corresponds to maximizing the entropy for a given mean energy. This leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons. The resulting equilibrium values for mean energy (E) and entropy (S) as a function of temperature (T) and volume (V) are:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n    $E = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} T^4$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy:**\n    $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3} T^3$\n\nThese can also be related by the expression $S = \\frac{4E}{3T}$.\n\n<<<Equilibrium Mean Energy: $E = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} T^4$. Equilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3} T^3$.>>>"
