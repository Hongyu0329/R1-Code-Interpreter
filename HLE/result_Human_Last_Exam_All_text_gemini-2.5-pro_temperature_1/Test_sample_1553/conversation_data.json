    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific piece of information: the name of a character from a specific novel.\n*   **Novel:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Protagonist:** The \"main character\"\n*   **Action:** Marries\n*   **Target Information:** The name of the person the protagonist marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe main character, or protagonist, of Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski. He is a human from the 21st century who has been resurrected into a far-future, post-human reality.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the significant relationships of the main character.**\nUpon his \"rebirth,\" Adam Zamoyski is guided and protected by a member of the dominant post-human civilization (known as the Stahs). This character is a central figure in his life in this new world. Her name is Angelika Soyle.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the specific event of \"marriage\" in the context of the novel.**\nThe relationship between Adam Zamoyski and Angelika Soyle is complex and evolves throughout the story. They eventually form a formal union.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important to understand that \"marriage\" in this advanced science fiction context is not a traditional human wedding. It is a much more profound, symbiotic, and political bond that solidifies their alliance and Adam's position within the post-human society. Despite the different context, it is the direct equivalent of marriage within the plot.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude with the name of the character.**\nBased on the plot of the novel, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries is Angelika Soyle.\n\n<<<Angelika Soyle>>>"
