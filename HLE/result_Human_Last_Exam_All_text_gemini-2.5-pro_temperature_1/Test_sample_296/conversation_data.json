    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, denoted by $G$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and the relevant group theory**\n\nThe number of subgroups of index $n$ in a group $G$ is the sum of the sizes of all conjugacy classes of subgroups of index $n$. A conjugacy class of subgroups of index $n$ corresponds to an equivalence class of transitive permutation representations of $G$ on a set of $n$ elements. Such a representation is a homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to S_n$ whose image is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$.\n\nFor this problem, $n=4$. We need to consider all possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ as potential images of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the transitive subgroups of $S_4$**\n\nThe transitive subgroups of $S_4$ (up to conjugacy) are:\n1.  The cyclic group $C_4$ of order 4.\n2.  The Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$ of order 4.\n3.  The dihedral group $D_8$ (also denoted $D_4$) of order 8.\n4.  The alternating group $A_4$ of order 12.\n5.  The symmetric group $S_4$ of order 24.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate impossible image groups**\n\nThe Grigorchuk group $G$ is a 2-group, meaning the order of every element is a power of 2. A fundamental property of homomorphisms is that the order of the image of an element must divide the order of the element itself. Consequently, any homomorphic image of $G$ must also be a 2-group.\n\n*   $|A_4| = 12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. Not a 2-group.\n*   $|S_4| = 24 = 2^3 \\cdot 3$. Not a 2-group.\n\nTherefore, there can be no surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $A_4$ or $S_4$. We only need to consider $C_4$, $V_4$, and $D_8$ as possible images.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the case of abelian quotients ($C_4$ and $V_4$)**\n\nAny homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group must factor through its abelianization, $G_{ab} = G/G'$. It is a well-known (and non-trivial) property of the Grigorchuk group that its abelianization is isomorphic to the elementary abelian group of order 8:\n$G_{ab} \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 \\cong (C_2)^3$.\n\n*   **Case 1: Image is $C_4$**\n    A surjective homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to C_4$ would induce a surjective homomorphism from $G_{ab} \\cong (C_2)^3$ to $C_4$. However, every element in $(C_2)^3$ has order 2, so its image under any homomorphism must have an order that divides 2. No element in the image can have order 4. Thus, the image cannot be $C_4$. There are **no** subgroups of index 4 with quotient $C_4$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Image is $V_4$**\n    We need to count the number of surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $V_4 \\cong (C_2)^2$. This is equivalent to counting surjective homomorphisms from $G_{ab} \\cong (C_2)^3$ to $(C_2)^2$.\n    A surjective linear map from a 3D vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ to a 2D vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ has a 1-dimensional kernel. The number of such maps is equivalent to the number of ways to choose a 1D kernel.\n    The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in $(\\mathbb{F}_2)^3$ is the number of non-zero vectors, which is $2^3 - 1 = 7$. Each non-zero vector spans a unique 1D subspace.\n    Each of these 7 kernels corresponds to a unique normal subgroup of $G$ of index 4 with quotient $V_4$. A subgroup whose quotient is abelian is necessarily normal. These 7 subgroups are all distinct and normal, so they form 7 distinct conjugacy classes of size 1.\n    Thus, there are **7 normal subgroups of index 4**.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the case of non-abelian quotients ($D_8$)**\n\nThis case corresponds to non-normal subgroups of index 4. A non-normal subgroup $H$ of index 4 gives rise to a transitive representation $\\rho: G \\to S_4$ whose image is non-abelian. From our list, the only possibility is $D_8$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes of such subgroups is equal to the number of equivalence classes of transitive representations $\\rho: G \\to S_4$ with image $D_8$. Two representations $\\rho_1, \\rho_2$ are equivalent if $\\rho_2(g) = \\sigma \\rho_1(g) \\sigma^{-1}$ for some permutation $\\sigma \\in S_4$.\n\n1.  **Existence of Epimorphism:** It is a known result that the natural action of $G$ on the second level of the binary tree gives rise to a surjective homomorphism $\\phi_0: G \\to D_8$.\n\n2.  **Uniqueness of Epimorphism:** A crucial result by A. Garrido states that any epimorphism $\\phi: G \\to D_8$ is equivalent to $\\phi_0$ up to an automorphism of $D_8$. That is, $\\phi = \\alpha \\circ \\phi_0$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\text{Aut}(D_8)$.\n\n3.  **Counting Representation Classes:** We need to count the number of epimorphisms $\\rho: G \\to D_8 \\subset S_4$ up to conjugation in $S_4$. Any such representation is of the form $\\rho_\\alpha = i \\circ \\alpha \\circ \\phi_0$, where $i: D_8 \\hookrightarrow S_4$ is a fixed inclusion and $\\alpha \\in \\text{Aut}(D_8)$.\n    Two such representations $\\rho_\\alpha$ and $\\rho_\\beta$ are equivalent if there exists $\\sigma \\in S_4$ such that $\\rho_\\beta = c_\\sigma \\circ \\rho_\\alpha$, where $c_\\sigma$ is conjugation by $\\sigma$. This implies that the automorphism $\\beta \\alpha^{-1}$ must be an inner automorphism of $D_8$ induced by conjugation by an element of $N_{S_4}(D_8)$.\n    The normalizer of a Sylow 2-subgroup $D_8$ in $S_4$ is $D_8$ itself, i.e., $N_{S_4}(D_8) = D_8$.\n    Therefore, two representations are equivalent if and only if $\\beta \\alpha^{-1} \\in \\text{Inn}(D_8)$. The number of inequivalent representations is the number of cosets of $\\text{Inn}(D_8)$ in $\\text{Aut}(D_8)$, which is the order of the outer automorphism group, $|\\text{Out}(D_8)|$.\n    For the dihedral group $D_8$, we have $\\text{Aut}(D_8) \\cong D_8$ and $\\text{Inn}(D_8) \\cong D_8/Z(D_8) \\cong V_4$.\n    So, $|\\text{Out}(D_8)| = |\\text{Aut}(D_8)| / |\\text{Inn}(D_8)| = 8 / 4 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Counting Subgroups:** There are **2** distinct equivalence classes of representations of $G$ on 4 elements with image $D_8$. Each class corresponds to a single conjugacy class of subgroups of index 4. The number of subgroups in such a conjugacy class is equal to the number of elements being acted on, which is 4.\n    So, we have 2 conjugacy classes, each containing 4 non-normal subgroups.\n    Total number of non-normal subgroups = $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the normal and non-normal subgroups.\n*   Number of normal subgroups = 7\n*   Number of non-normal subgroups = 8\n*   Total number of subgroups = 7 + 8 = 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
