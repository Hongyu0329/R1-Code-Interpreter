    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific \"conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues:\n    *   It was mentioned by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   Braudel was quoting another writer, Paul Morand.\n    *   The entity is described with a metaphor: it \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   An example related to this entity is \"the symbol of a nation.\"\n    *   The overall context is Braudel's emphasis on a \"global historical perspective.\"\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The first step is to find the specific passage where Braudel quotes Morand. This requires knowledge of Braudel's work or a targeted search. The quote appears in Braudel's book, *The Identity of France*.\n\n3.  **Examine the Exact Quote:** The relevant passage, as cited by Braudel, is based on Paul Morand's statement. A common translation/paraphrase of the idea is: \"Paul Morand once said that a **civilization** should be inscribed within a sphere, of which the symbol of a nation would be the central point.\"\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Conceptual Entity\":**\n    *   The quote explicitly names the entity. The entity that \"should be inscribed within a sphere\" is **civilization**.\n    *   The \"symbol of a nation\" is not the entity itself, but rather the *center* of the sphere that contains the civilization. This aligns with Braudel's historical method, where a nation is a key component but must be understood within the much larger and longer-term context of its surrounding civilization (e.g., France within the context of European or Western civilization).\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The question asks for the conceptual entity that is inscribed within the sphere. According to the quote from Paul Morand, which Fernand Braudel uses to frame his own analysis, that entity is \"civilization.\"\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Attribution:** It's crucial to recognize that this is a quote. The idea originates with Morand, but Braudel adopts it because it aligns with his own historical framework (*longue dur√©e* and total history).\n*   **The Role of the \"Nation\":** A potential point of confusion is the role of the \"nation.\" The question says the entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This could be misinterpreted to mean the nation *is* the entity. However, a careful reading of the full quote reveals the nation is the *center* of the sphere, while the civilization is the larger entity contained *within* it. The nation is a focal point for understanding the civilization.\n*   **The Metaphor:** The \"sphere\" is a powerful metaphor for a global, all-encompassing, and interconnected perspective, which is central to Braudel's work.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the entity in question.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
