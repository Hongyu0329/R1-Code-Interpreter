    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n*   **Benzamide core:** A benzene ring attached to an amide group, -C(=O)N-.\n*   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, giving -C(=O)N(Et)₂. This group is at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n*   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n        C(=O)N(Et)₂\n       /\n    (C1)\n   /   \\\n(C2)-H   (C6)-H\n  |       |\n(C3)-N(Me)₂ (C5)-H\n   \\   /\n    (C4)\n     |\n     H\n```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and Conditions of the First Step**\nThe first step involves reacting the starting material with `sec-BuLi` and `TMEDA` in `THF`.\n*   **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium):** This is a very strong organolithium base. Its primary role here is to deprotonate the most acidic proton on the aromatic ring.\n*   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** This is a bidentate chelating ligand. It coordinates to the lithium ion (Li⁺), breaking up the aggregates of sec-BuLi and increasing its basicity. It also helps to stabilize the organolithium intermediate formed after deprotonation.\n*   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran):** This is the aprotic polar solvent for the reaction.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In this reaction, a functional group on the ring directs the lithiation (replacement of H with Li) to an adjacent (ortho) position.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation)**\nWe must identify the most acidic proton on the benzene ring by considering the directing groups.\n*   The starting material has two powerful directing groups: the N,N-diethylamide group [-C(=O)N(Et)₂] at C1 and the dimethylamino group [-N(Me)₂] at C3.\n*   The amide group directs lithiation to its ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n*   The dimethylamino group directs lithiation to its ortho positions: C2 and C4.\n*   The proton at the C2 position is ortho to **both** directing groups. This is a case of a **synergistic or cooperative effect**. When two directing groups are in a meta-relationship (1,3-positions), they strongly activate the proton at the position between them (C2) for deprotonation. The lithium ion can be stabilized by forming a six-membered chelate ring with the carbonyl oxygen of the amide and the nitrogen of the amino group.\n*   Therefore, the deprotonation will occur selectively and almost exclusively at the C2 position. This forms a 2-lithio derivative as the intermediate.\n\n**Intermediate:** N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Step**\nThe second step is the reaction of the organolithium intermediate with `methyl iodide (CH₃I)`.\n*   **Methyl Iodide (CH₃I):** This is an electrophile.\n*   **Reaction:** The organolithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile (a carbanion at C2). It will attack the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The C-Li bond is replaced by a C-CH₃ bond, and LiI is formed as a byproduct.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Final Product**\n*   The overall reaction replaces the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the starting material with a methyl group.\n*   The final product has the following substituents on the benzene ring:\n    *   -C(=O)N(Et)₂ at C1\n    *   -CH₃ at C2\n    *   -N(Me)₂ at C3\n*   The systematic name of the resulting compound is **N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The most critical point is recognizing that the reaction is a Directed ortho-Metalation and identifying the correct site of lithiation. The cooperative effect of the two meta-positioned directing groups is the key to determining the regioselectivity.\n*   **Function of Reagents:** Understand the role of each component: sec-BuLi (base), TMEDA (chelator/activator), and CH₃I (electrophile).\n*   **Stability of Functional Groups:** Note that the strong base does not attack the amide carbonyl group. DoM is kinetically much faster under these conditions.\n\nThe final compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
