    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Diagram:** The question describes a Feynman diagram in \"perturbative Green's function analysis.\" It features:\n    *   **Two vertices:** This means the diagram represents a second-order term in the perturbative expansion of the interaction Lagrangian ($L_{int}$).\n    *   **Four field contractions:** A field contraction corresponds to an internal line (a propagator) in a diagram. Each internal line connects two field operators.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Diagram's Topology:** To have two vertices and four internal lines, the interaction must involve at least four fields at each vertex. The simplest and most common such interaction is in a scalar field theory with a $\\lambda\\phi^4$ term, where $L_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$.\n    *   Each vertex has four \"legs\" (field operators).\n    *   Two vertices therefore have a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ legs.\n    *   Four field contractions (internal lines) use $4 \\times 2 = 8$ legs.\n    *   Since all legs are used for internal lines, the diagram has **no external lines**. It is a vacuum-to-vacuum diagram (a \"vacuum bubble\").\n    *   The only way to connect two vertices using four lines is to have all four lines run between the two vertices. This diagram is sometimes called a \"double-bubble\" or \"figure-eight\" diagram.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of the Interaction:** The problem does not explicitly state the theory (e.g., $\\lambda\\phi^4$, QED). However, the description of two vertices and four contractions strongly implies a $\\phi^4$-type interaction, which we will assume. The factor of $1/4!$ in the Lagrangian definition is crucial for the combinatorial analysis.\n*   **Definition of Symmetry Factor (S):** The symmetry factor is the order of the automorphism group of the diagram. It represents the number of ways the internal components (lines and vertices) can be interchanged without changing the diagram's overall structure (topology). The contribution of any given diagram to a Green's function is proportional to $1/S$.\n*   **Sources of Symmetry:** For any given diagram, the symmetries can arise from:\n    1.  **Permutations of identical internal lines:** If multiple identical lines connect the same two vertices (or a vertex to itself), they can be permuted.\n    2.  **Permutations of identical vertices:** If two or more vertices are of the same type and swapping them (along with the lines attached to them) leaves the diagram unchanged, this contributes to the symmetry factor.\n    3.  **Symmetry of a line itself:** An internal line connecting a vertex to itself (a loop) has a \"flipping\" symmetry, contributing a factor of 2. This does not apply to lines connecting two distinct vertices, as that operation is already counted in the vertex permutation.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe can calculate the symmetry factor using the rules derived from the diagram's automorphism group.\n\n1.  **Analyze Vertex Symmetry:**\n    *   The diagram consists of two vertices, which originate from the same interaction term ($\\phi^4$). Therefore, the vertices are identical.\n    *   We can swap the positions of the two vertices ($v_1 \\leftrightarrow v_2$), and the diagram remains unchanged because all four lines simply connect these two points.\n    *   The number of such permutations is $2! = 2$.\n    *   **Contribution to S from vertices = 2.**\n\n2.  **Analyze Line Symmetry:**\n    *   There are four internal lines connecting the two vertices.\n    *   These lines represent identical scalar propagators and are topologically equivalent. We can permute these four lines among themselves in any order, and the diagram will look identical.\n    *   The number of permutations of these four lines is $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n    *   **Contribution to S from lines = 24.**\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Symmetry Factor:**\n    *   The total symmetry factor $S$ is the product of the factors from all independent symmetry operations.\n    *   $S = (\\text{Vertex Symmetry Factor}) \\times (\\text{Line Symmetry Factor})$\n    *   $S = 2 \\times 24$\n    *   $S = 48$\n\nThe symmetry factor associated with this Feynman diagram is 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
