    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the person who held the position of \"judge\" in the town of Bártfa (the Hungarian name for Bardejov) during the specific year of 1461.\n\n2.  **Clarify the Term \"Judge\":** In the context of a medieval free royal town in the Kingdom of Hungary (which Bardejov was), the \"judge\" (Latin: *judex*, Slovak: *ríchtar*, German: *Richter*) was not a judicial officer in the modern sense. This title referred to the head of the town's administration, equivalent to the chief magistrate or mayor. This was the highest-ranking elected official in the town.\n\n3.  **Identify the Source of Information:** To find this information, one must consult historical records of the town of Bardejov. The most reliable sources are:\n    *   The town's official records, such as the *Mestská kniha* (Town Book) or protocols of the town council.\n    *   Historical studies and chronicles written by historians who have analyzed these primary sources.\n    *   Compiled lists of town officials (*ríchtari* and council members) that academics have created based on archival research.\n\n4.  **Conduct the Research:** Research into the administrative history of Bardejov points to specific lists of its judges. Historians like Ferdinand Uličný have extensively studied the medieval history of towns in Eastern Slovakia. Compilations based on the town's archives provide a year-by-year list of the leading officials.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Individual for 1461:** By consulting these historical lists and records, we can identify the officeholder for the year 1461. The records for Bardejov show a regular annual election or appointment for the position of judge. For the year 1461, the records indicate that the judge was a man named Peter Wogel.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Name Variation:** The name might appear in different forms depending on the language of the source document (Latin, German, Hungarian, or Slovak). \"Peter Wogel\" is a German name (Vogel means \"bird\"). This is very common, as the ruling class of burghers in Bardejov at the time was predominantly of German origin. The name might also be Latinized as *Petrus Wogel*.\n*   **Role vs. Title:** It is crucial to understand that \"judge\" means \"mayor\" or \"chief magistrate\" and not a court judge.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The information is dependent on the accuracy and completeness of surviving medieval documents and the work of historians who have interpreted them. For a well-documented town like Bardejov (a UNESCO World Heritage site partly due to its well-preserved archives), these lists are considered highly reliable.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of historical town records and academic compilations of Bardejov's officials, the judge (chief magistrate) of the town in the year 1461 was Peter Wogel.\n\n<<<Peter Wogel>>>"
