    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Conductor**\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Checking for divisibility by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Checking for divisibility of 7657 by small primes: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Checking for divisibility of 589 by small primes: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor $d$ is a square-free integer.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The structure of the group of characters and the condition for a character to be primitive are simpler for square-free conductors.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character**\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem for characters, any Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo its prime factors:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo $p$.\n\nFor a square-free conductor $d$, the character $\\chi$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_p$ is primitive. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is not the trivial character (the character that maps all integers coprime to $p$ to 1). The trivial character has an order of 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** For $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d=7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, each component character $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial, which means $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) > 1$ for all $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Order of the Character**\n\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\nThe order of any character $\\chi_p$ modulo $p$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n*   For $p=7$, $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n*   For $p=13$, $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n*   For $p=19$, $\\phi(19) = 18$.\n*   For $p=31$, $\\phi(31) = 30$.\n\nIn all four cases, 6 is a divisor of $p-1$.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Counting Strategy**\n\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  **Primitivity:** For each $p$, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) > 1$.\n2.  **Order:** $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\nWe can solve this using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, or more formally, with Mobius inversion on the lattice of divisors of 6.\n\nLet $f(k)$ be the number of primitive characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ whose order divides $k$.\nLet $N(k)$ be the number of primitive characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ with order exactly $k$.\nWe have the relation $f(k) = \\sum_{j|k} N(j)$.\nBy Mobius inversion, we can find $N(6)$:\n$N(6) = \\sum_{k|6} \\mu(6/k) f(k) = \\mu(1)f(6) + \\mu(2)f(3) + \\mu(3)f(2) + \\mu(6)f(1)$.\n$N(6) = f(6) - f(3) - f(2) + f(1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate f(k) for k | 6**\n\nA character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_p$ is primitive with order dividing $k$ if and only if each component $\\chi_p$ is a non-trivial character whose order divides $k$.\n\nThe number of characters modulo $p$ whose order divides $k$ is $\\gcd(k, \\phi(p)) = \\gcd(k, p-1)$.\nThe number of *non-trivial* characters modulo $p$ whose order divides $k$ is $\\gcd(k, p-1) - 1$.\n\nSince the choices for each $\\chi_p$ are independent, $f(k)$ is the product of the number of choices for each component:\n$f(k) = \\prod_{p|d} (\\gcd(k, p-1) - 1)$.\nThe relevant values of $p-1$ are 6, 12, 18, 30.\n\n*   **For k=1:**\n    $f(1) = (\\gcd(1,6)-1)(\\gcd(1,12)-1)(\\gcd(1,18)-1)(\\gcd(1,30)-1) = (1-1)(1-1)(1-1)(1-1) = 0$.\n\n*   **For k=2:**\n    $f(2) = (\\gcd(2,6)-1)(\\gcd(2,12)-1)(\\gcd(2,18)-1)(\\gcd(2,30)-1) = (2-1)(2-1)(2-1)(2-1) = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **For k=3:**\n    $f(3) = (\\gcd(3,6)-1)(\\gcd(3,12)-1)(\\gcd(3,18)-1)(\\gcd(3,30)-1) = (3-1)(3-1)(3-1)(3-1) = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **For k=6:**\n    $f(6) = (\\gcd(6,6)-1)(\\gcd(6,12)-1)(\\gcd(6,18)-1)(\\gcd(6,30)-1) = (6-1)(6-1)(6-1)(6-1) = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The calculation of $f(k)$ must be done for all divisors of 6, which are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Each $f(k)$ represents the total count of primitive characters with an order that is a divisor of $k$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nNow we substitute the values of $f(k)$ into the Mobius inversion formula for $N(6)$:\n$N(6) = f(6) - f(3) - f(2) + f(1)$\n$N(6) = 625 - 16 - 1 + 0$\n$N(6) = 608$.\n\nThus, there are 608 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6.\n\n<<<608>>>"
