    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the source of \"Sir Launfal\".**\nThe question asks what book of manners was preserved *alongside* \"Sir Launfal\". This implies they were part of the same physical document, most likely a medieval manuscript. The primary manuscript containing the Middle English poem \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre needs to be identified. Research shows this manuscript is the famous **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, held in the British Library.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the nature of the manuscript.**\nThe Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is not a single book but a miscellany or anthology. This means it is a collection of different, unrelated works bound together in one volume. This is common for medieval manuscripts. Therefore, to answer the question, we must look at the other texts included in this specific manuscript.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the contents of Cotton Caligula A.ii.**\nThis manuscript contains a number of important Middle English texts. Besides \"Sir Launfal,\" it includes:\n*   *La»ùamon's Brut* (the earlier of the two surviving versions)\n*   *The Owl and the Nightingale*\n*   *The Assumption of Our Lady*\n*   *Floris and Blancheflour*\n*   And several other shorter religious and didactic poems.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"book of manners\" within the manuscript.**\nNow we must scan the list of contents for a work that can be classified as a \"book of manners\" or a \"courtesy book.\" This genre of literature provides instruction on etiquette, social conduct, and morals, typically for young people aspiring to a higher social status. Among the various poems in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is one specifically dedicated to this purpose.\n\n**Step 5: Pinpoint the specific text.**\nThe work in question is known as ***The Book of Courtesy***. It is a short, didactic poem that gives advice to young men on how to behave properly in the households of lords, covering topics from table manners to general moral conduct. This text perfectly fits the description of a \"book of manners.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the manuscript that preserved \"Sir Launfal\" (Cotton Caligula A.ii) and then examining its contents, we can find the \"book of manners\" that was preserved alongside it. That book is titled *The Book of Courtesy*.\n\n<<<The Book of Courtesy>>>"
