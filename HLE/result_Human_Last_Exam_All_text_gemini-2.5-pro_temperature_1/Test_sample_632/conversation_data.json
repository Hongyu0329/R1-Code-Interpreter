    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon church is located there.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\". This could refer to a building, a structure, decoration, or even urban infrastructure that defined the space.\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n*   **Timeframe:** Until 1950. This is a very specific date and is the key to finding the correct answer.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination of Incorrect Possibilities**\n*   **The Pantheon's Bell Towers:** The Pantheon once had two bell towers, added by Bernini in the 17th century and nicknamed \"the ass's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino). However, these were removed in 1883, which is much earlier than 1950. So, this is not the correct answer.\n*   **Buildings surrounding the Pantheon:** For centuries, the Pantheon was crowded by medieval and Renaissance buildings built right up against it. A major project to \"isolate\" the monument by demolishing these adjacent structures took place primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While this was a major architectural change, it did not happen specifically in 1950.\n*   **The Fountain and Obelisk:** The fountain in the center of the square (Fontana del Pantheon) and its Egyptian obelisk are still there today. They were not removed.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the 1950 Timeframe**\nThe year 1950 is significant. After World War II, many European cities underwent modernization. A key aspect of this was changing urban transportation, often favoring cars and buses over older systems like trams. The year 1950 was also a Holy Year (Anno Santo) in Rome, which prompted many urban cleanup and modernization projects to prepare the city for pilgrims.\n\n**Step 4: Investigating Urban Infrastructure**\nConsidering the context of mid-20th century urban changes, we should look at transportation infrastructure.\n*   Historical photographs of the Piazza della Rotonda from the early 20th century show a prominent feature that is no longer present.\n*   This feature was a **tram line**. The tracks for the public tram system ran directly through the piazza, making a loop around the central fountain.\n*   From a modern perspective, having a tram run just a few meters from the Pantheon's portico and around its historic fountain is a very \"unique\" and almost unthinkable feature.\n*   The tram lines in Rome's historic center, including the one in Piazza della Rotonda, were progressively dismantled in the post-war years. The removal of the tracks from this specific square was completed in **1950** as part of the move to modernize the city's transport network.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe unique architectural feature that existed in the Piazza della Rotonda until it was removed in 1950 was the public tram line, whose tracks circled the central fountain in front of the Pantheon.\n\n<<<A public tram line>>>"
