Yes, the theory can fail. The addition of a birefringent medium can change the polarization state of the light before it enters the random medium. If the random medium itself is polarization-dependent (i.e., it affects horizontal and vertical polarizations differently), its full transmission matrix has components that describe its effect on all input polarizations. The original experiment, using only a horizontally polarized input, would only characterize the medium's response to horizontal polarization. The inverse matrix derived from this measurement would be incomplete. When the birefringent element creates a beam with a vertical polarization component, this component will be scrambled by the random medium in a way that the incomplete inverse matrix cannot account for. Therefore, the inverse process will fail to reconstruct the original input beam.
