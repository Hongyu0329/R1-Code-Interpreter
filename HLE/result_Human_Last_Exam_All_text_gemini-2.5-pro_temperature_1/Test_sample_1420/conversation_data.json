    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat using the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem and Key Concepts**\n\nThe question asks for the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat, $C$. Near a critical point, the singular part of the specific heat scales with the reduced temperature $t = (T - T_c)/T_c$ as:\n$C \\sim |t|^{-\\alpha}$\n\nThe method to be used is the **epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion**, a cornerstone of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory. This method involves performing calculations in a dimension $d$ that is slightly below the **upper critical dimension** ($d_c$), by defining a small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. The critical exponents are then computed as a power series in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Universality Class and Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**\n\nThe problem concerns specific heat, which is a thermodynamic property. For systems like simple magnets (e.g., Ising model) or liquid-gas transitions, the relevant model is the $\\phi^4$ theory. For a scalar order parameter (like magnetization in the Ising model), this corresponds to the O(N) model with N=1.\n\nFor the O(N) model with short-range interactions, the upper critical dimension is:\n$d_c = 4$\n\nThis is the dimension above which mean-field theory exponents become exact.\n\n**Step 3: Define and Determine the Value of $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe epsilon expansion parameter is defined as:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d$\n\nThe problem specifies a spatial dimension $d=3$. Therefore, we have:\n$\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** While the $\\epsilon$ expansion is formally an expansion for small $\\epsilon$, setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a significant extrapolation. The results are approximate but provide a systematic way to get corrections to mean-field theory. The leading-order calculation is a standard and robust result taught in statistical physics.\n\n**Step 4: Use Scaling Relations to Relate Exponents**\n\nThe critical exponents are not all independent; they are connected by scaling relations. The Josephson hyperscaling relation connects $\\alpha$ to the correlation length exponent, $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension, $d$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\nu d$\n\nTo find $\\alpha$, we first need to find the expression for $\\nu$ in the $\\epsilon$ expansion.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Correlation Length Exponent $\\nu$**\n\nUsing the RG framework for the O(N) model, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ can be calculated as a series in $\\epsilon$. The standard one-loop (leading order) result is:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This result comes from calculating the RG flow of the coupling constants and analyzing the behavior near the non-trivial (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point. The exponent $\\nu$ is related to the thermal eigenvalue of the RG transformation at this fixed point.\n\n**Step 6: Derive the Scaling Exponent $\\alpha$ in the $\\epsilon$ Expansion**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $\\nu$ and $d=4-\\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - \\nu d$. We will keep terms only up to the first order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right) (4 - \\epsilon)$\n\nLet's expand the product:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\epsilon\\right) + \\left(\\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon \\cdot 4\\right) - \\left(\\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon \\cdot \\epsilon\\right) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nWe only need terms up to order $\\epsilon$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + \\frac{N+2}{N+8}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = 2 - 2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon - \\frac{N+2}{N+8}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{N+2}{N+8} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nNow, combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n$\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{N+8 - 2(N+2)}{2(N+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{N+8 - 2N - 4}{2(N+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 7: Specialize to the Case of Interest (Ising Universality)**\n\nAs mentioned in Step 2, the specific heat of a typical magnetic system or fluid falls into the Ising universality class, which corresponds to a scalar order parameter, i.e., N=1.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The choice of N is crucial. For an XY model, N=2, and for a Heisenberg model, N=3. The sign of $\\alpha$ depends on N. For N>4, $\\alpha$ becomes negative at this order, indicating a cusp rather than a divergence in the specific heat.\n\nSubstituting N=1 into our expression for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon$\n\nSo, the leading-order result for the specific heat exponent is $\\alpha = \\epsilon/6$.\n\n**Step 8: Acquire the Final Answer for d=3**\n\nFinally, we substitute the value of $\\epsilon = 1$ (for $d=3$) into our result:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nNumerically, this is approximately 0.167. This leading-order result is a classic prediction of the Renormalization Group theory.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis proceeds by identifying the upper critical dimension ($d_c=4$), using the $\\epsilon=d_c-d=1$ expansion, relating $\\alpha$ to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ via hyperscaling ($\\alpha = 2-\\nu d$), using the one-loop RG result for $\\nu$ in the Ising (N=1) universality class, and combining these to find $\\alpha$ to leading order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
