    "Answering the question: \"Suppose $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum with $x \\in X$. Consider the Stone-Cech compactification of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. What is the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder?\"\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions and Setup\n\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable (HI) Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. An indecomposable continuum cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Examples include the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $M$, the composant of a point $p \\in M$ is the set of all points $q \\in M$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $M$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The composants of an indecomposable continuum partition the space. Any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$) distinct composants.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification and Remainder:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, its Stone-Cech compactification is denoted $\\beta Y$. The Stone-Cech remainder is $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n*   **The Space in Question:** We are given an HI continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$. We consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, which is a locally compact but not compact metric space. We need to analyze the structure of its Stone-Cech remainder, $Y^*$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of the Remainder $Y^*$\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"composants\" of the remainder $Y^*$. The definition of composants applies to indecomposable continua. This suggests that we should first understand the connected components of $Y^*$.\n\n1.  **Connected Components of the Remainder:** A theorem by J. Mioduszewski (1960) states that for any metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the connected components of the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ are themselves indecomposable continua.\n2.  **Composants of the Remainder:** If $Y^*$ is not connected, let its connected components be $\\{K_\\alpha\\}$. The \"composants of $Y^*$\" would be the union of the composants of each $K_\\alpha$. Since each $K_\\alpha$ is an indecomposable continuum, it has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. Therefore, the total number of composants of $Y^*$ is $|A| \\cdot 2^{\\aleph_0}$, where $|A|$ is the number of connected components of $Y^*$. To find the maximum number of composants, we must first find the maximum possible number of connected components of $Y^*$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Number of Connected Components of $Y^*$\n\nLet's determine the number of connected components of $Y^*$ for an HI continuum $X$. We will show that this number must be 1.\n\n1.  **Assume for contradiction** that $Y^*$ has more than one connected component. Let the set of components be $\\{K_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$, with $|A| > 1$.\n2.  **Construct an auxiliary space Z:** Let $Z$ be the quotient space obtained from $\\beta Y$ by collapsing each component $K_\\alpha$ to a distinct point $p_\\alpha$. The quotient map is $q: \\beta Y \\to Z$. Since each $K_\\alpha$ is a continuum, the map $q$ is monotone. $Z$ is a compact Hausdorff space (a continuum, in fact) which serves as a compactification of $Y$. The remainder of $Y$ in $Z$ is the set of points $P = \\{p_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$.\n3.  **Relate Z to X:** There is a natural continuous map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$ which is the identity on $Y$ and collapses the entire remainder $Y^*$ to the point $x$. Since $\\pi$ identifies all points in $Y^*$, and $q$ identifies points within each $K_\\alpha$, there exists a continuous surjective map $\\phi: Z \\to X$ such that $\\pi = \\phi \\circ q$. This map $\\phi$ is the identity on $Y$ and maps the entire set of points $P = \\{p_\\alpha\\}$ to the single point $x$.\n4.  **Show that Z is a Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   Let $H$ be any subcontinuum of $Z$. We want to show $H$ is indecomposable.\n    *   Assume $H$ is decomposable, so $H = A \\cup B$, where $A$ and $B$ are proper subcontinua of $H$.\n    *   Consider the images under $\\phi$: $\\phi(H) = \\phi(A) \\cup \\phi(B)$.\n    *   $\\phi(H)$ is a subcontinuum of $X$. Since $X$ is HI, $\\phi(H)$ must be indecomposable.\n    *   This implies either $\\phi(H) = \\phi(A)$ or $\\phi(H) = \\phi(B)$. Let's assume $\\phi(H) = \\phi(A)$.\n    *   The map $\\phi$ is injective except on the set $P = \\{p_\\alpha\\}$. Let $h \\in H$. If $\\phi(h) \\in \\phi(A)$, does this imply $h \\in A$?\n    *   If $h \\in H \\setminus P$, then $\\phi$ is injective at $h$. Since $\\phi(h) \\in \\phi(A)$, and $A$ contains all points of the form $p_\\alpha$ that might have the same image as points in $A \\setminus P$, we must have $h \\in A \\setminus P$ or $\\phi(h) \\in \\phi(A \\cap P)$. The map $\\phi$ is a homeomorphism from $Z \\setminus P$ to $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. So $\\phi(H \\setminus P) = \\phi(H) \\setminus \\{x\\}$ and $\\phi(A \\setminus P) = \\phi(A) \\setminus \\{x\\}$. The condition $\\phi(H) = \\phi(A)$ implies $\\phi(H \\setminus P) = \\phi(A \\setminus P)$, which by injectivity means $H \\setminus P = A \\setminus P$.\n    *   This implies $B \\setminus P \\subseteq A \\setminus P$. Since $A$ and $B$ are closed subsets of $Z$, taking closures gives $\\overline{B \\setminus P} \\subseteq \\overline{A \\setminus P}$.\n    *   Because $A$ and $B$ are continua, they do not have isolated points. Thus, every point in $B$ is a limit point of $B \\setminus P$ (unless $B$ consists of a single point from $P$, which would mean $B$ is not a proper subcontinuum of $H$ unless $H$ is also that point). So, $\\overline{B \\setminus P} = B$. Similarly, $\\overline{A \\setminus P} = A$.\n    *   Therefore, $B \\subseteq A$. Since $H = A \\cup B$, this implies $H=A$. This contradicts the assumption that $A$ is a proper subcontinuum of $H$.\n    *   The assumption that $H$ is decomposable leads to a contradiction. Thus, every subcontinuum $H$ of $Z$ is indecomposable. This means $Z$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum.\n\n5.  **Apply Cook's Theorem:** We have a continuous surjective map $\\phi: Z \\to X$ between two HI continua. A powerful theorem by H. Cook (1967) states that any continuous map between HI continua that is not a homeomorphism must have a decomposable subcontinuum in its range. Since the range is $X$, which is HI, this cannot happen. Therefore, the map $\\phi$ must be a homeomorphism.\n6.  **Reach the Final Contradiction:** For $\\phi$ to be a homeomorphism, it must be injective. However, $\\phi$ maps all the points $p_\\alpha \\in P$ to the single point $x$. Injectivity requires that the set $P$ contains only one point. This means $|A|=1$. This contradicts our initial assumption that $|A| > 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of connected components of the remainder $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ must be exactly 1. Let this single component be $K$.\n\n*   From Mioduszewski's theorem, $K$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n*   Since $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a non-compact metric space, it is not pseudocompact. Therefore, its Stone-Cech remainder $K$ is non-degenerate (i.e., not a single point).\n*   Any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n*   The set of composants of the remainder $Y^*$ is exactly the set of composants of its single component $K$.\n\nTherefore, the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder is $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This result holds for any HI continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$. The number is constant. The maximum possible number is thus this constant value.\n\nThe maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder is $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
