    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and Constraints**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid, where rows and columns are numbered 0 to 4.\n*   **Toroidal Property:** The board wraps around. This means row 0 is adjacent to row 4, and column 0 is adjacent to column 4. This is crucial for how attacks are calculated.\n*   **Non-Attacking Queens:** Four queens must be placed on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. For any two queens at positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`, the following conditions must be met:\n    1.  **No Row Attack:** `r1 ≠ r2`\n    2.  **No Column Attack:** `c1 ≠ c2`\n    3.  **No Diagonal Attack:** This is where the toroidal nature matters. On a standard board, diagonal attacks occur if `|r1 - r2| = |c1 - c2|`. This is equivalent to `r1 - c1 = r2 - c2` or `r1 + c1 = r2 + c2`. On a toroidal board, we use modular arithmetic.\n        *   `r1 - c1 ≢ r2 - c2 (mod 5)`\n        *   `r1 + c1 ≢ r2 + c2 (mod 5)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The main difficulty is correctly applying the toroidal diagonal attack rule using modular arithmetic.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Problem**\n\nSince we are placing 4 queens, and they cannot share a row or column, they must occupy 4 distinct rows and 4 distinct columns. We can break the problem down into three stages:\n1.  Choose which 4 of the 5 rows will contain a queen.\n2.  Choose which 4 of the 5 columns will contain a queen.\n3.  For the chosen 4x4 \"sub-board\", determine the number of ways to place the 4 queens so they don't attack each other diagonally.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Possibilities for Each Stage**\n\n1.  **Choosing Rows:** We need to choose 4 rows out of 5. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`.\n    *   Number of ways to choose rows = `C(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * 1!) = 5`.\n\n2.  **Choosing Columns:** Similarly, we need to choose 4 columns out of 5.\n    *   Number of ways to choose columns = `C(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * 1!) = 5`.\n\n3.  **Arranging the Queens on the Sub-Board:** This is the most complex part. Let's determine the number of valid arrangements for a *fixed* set of 4 rows and 4 columns.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must justify that this number is the same regardless of which 4 rows and 4 columns we choose. Due to the board's toroidal symmetry, any set of 4 rows and 4 columns is structurally identical to any other. A valid solution on one sub-board can be translated (mod 5) to a valid solution on another. Therefore, we can pick a specific set of rows and columns for our calculation without loss of generality.\n\n**Step 4: Finding Valid Arrangements on a Fixed 4x4 Sub-Board**\n\nLet's assume we have chosen rows {0, 1, 2, 3} and columns {0, 1, 2, 3}. We are placing one queen in each chosen row. The positions of the queens can be represented as `(0, p₀), (1, p₁), (2, p₂), (3, p₃)`, where `(p₀, p₁, p₂, p₃)` is a permutation of `(0, 1, 2, 3)`.\n\nWe need to find the permutations that satisfy the two diagonal constraints for all pairs of queens `(i, pᵢ)` and `(j, pⱼ)`:\n1.  `i - pᵢ ≢ j - pⱼ (mod 5)`\n2.  `i + pᵢ ≢ j + pⱼ (mod 5)`\n\nThere are `4! = 24` possible permutations. We can test them. Let's analyze one valid case and one invalid case.\n\n*   **Invalid Case Example:** Permutation `p = (0, 1, 2, 3)`.\n    *   Queens are at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3).\n    *   Let's check the first diagonal constraint: `i - pᵢ (mod 5)`.\n    *   For (0,0): `0 - 0 = 0`\n    *   For (1,1): `1 - 1 = 0`\n    *   Since `0 - 0 ≡ 1 - 1 (mod 5)`, these queens attack each other. This permutation is invalid.\n\n*   **Valid Case Example:** Permutation `p = (1, 3, 0, 2)`.\n    *   Queens are at (0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2).\n    *   Let's check the first diagonal constraint: `dᵢ = i - pᵢ (mod 5)`.\n        *   `d₀ = 0 - 1 = -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n        *   `d₁ = 1 - 3 = -2 ≡ 3 (mod 5)`\n        *   `d₂ = 2 - 0 = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n        *   `d₃ = 3 - 2 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n        *   The values {4, 3, 2, 1} are all distinct. This condition is met.\n    *   Let's check the second diagonal constraint: `sᵢ = i + pᵢ (mod 5)`.\n        *   `s₀ = 0 + 1 = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n        *   `s₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n        *   `s₂ = 2 + 0 = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n        *   `s₃ = 3 + 2 = 5 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`\n        *   The values {1, 4, 2, 0} are all distinct. This condition is also met.\n    *   Therefore, the permutation `(1, 3, 0, 2)` represents a valid arrangement.\n\nBy systematically checking all 24 permutations, we find there are exactly two that work:\n1.  `p₁ = (1, 3, 0, 2)`\n2.  `p₂ = (2, 0, 3, 1)`\n\nSo, for any chosen set of 4 rows and 4 columns, there are **2** valid ways to arrange the queens.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nNow we combine the results from the different stages.\n*   Total Ways = (Ways to choose rows) × (Ways to choose columns) × (Ways to arrange per choice)\n*   Total Ways = `C(5, 4) * C(5, 4) * 2`\n*   Total Ways = `5 * 5 * 2`\n*   Total Ways = 50\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
