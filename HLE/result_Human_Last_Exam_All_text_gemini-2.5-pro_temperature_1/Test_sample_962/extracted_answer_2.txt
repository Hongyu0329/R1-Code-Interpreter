The final answer is a detailed step-by-step methodology for designing a t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol and tight security. The design involves three main phases: a one-time Distributed Key Generation (DKG) using Pedersen VSS; an offline preprocessing phase for generating two-part nonce commitments `(D_i, E_i)` to prevent key exfiltration attacks; and a two-round online signing protocol. The signing protocol is structured as follows: In Round 1, participants commit to their nonces. In Round 2, after a coordinator computes binding values `œÅ_i`, a group nonce commitment `R`, and a tightly-secure challenge `c = H(R, m)`, each participant computes and sends their signature share `s_i`. The final signature `(R, s)` is formed by summing the shares. This design is based on the principles of the FROST protocol, enhanced with the Katz-Wang signature formulation for tight security.
