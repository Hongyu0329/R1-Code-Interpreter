    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the colours defining the range.**\nThe question asks for the musical note corresponding to a range on Newton's colour circle. The range is defined as being \"between the colour produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself\".\n\n*   First, we must determine the colour produced by combining yellow and blue. In the context of pigments and standard colour theory (subtractive mixing), mixing yellow and blue produces **green**.\n*   The second colour is explicitly stated as **blue**.\n*   Therefore, the range in question is from **Green** to **Blue**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Newton's Colour Circle and its relation to music.**\nIsaac Newton proposed a connection between the visible spectrum of light and the notes of a musical scale. He divided a circle into seven sections, corresponding to the seven colours of the rainbow (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet). He then associated these seven colours with the seven notes of a Western musical scale.\n\n**Step 3: Map the identified colours to Newton's musical notes.**\nNewton's specific mapping associated the colours with the notes of a diatonic scale, often cited as the Dorian mode starting on the note D. The correspondence is as follows:\n\n*   Red -> D\n*   Orange -> E\n*   Yellow -> F\n*   **Green -> G**\n*   **Blue -> A**\n*   Indigo -> B\n*   Violet -> C\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the specific range and determine the corresponding note.**\nThe range is specified as \"between Green and Blue\". On Newton's circle, Green and Blue are adjacent colour sections.\n\n*   The section for Green corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n*   The section for Blue corresponds to the musical note **A**.\n\nThe question asks for a single \"musical note\" that corresponds to this range. Since the range starts with Green (the result of the yellow and blue combination) and extends to Blue, we must choose the most representative note. The first boundary of the range is explicitly defined by the puzzle \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue,\" which is Green. The most logical interpretation is that the question is asking for the note associated with this starting point of the range.\n\n*   The starting colour of the range is **Green**.\n*   The musical note corresponding to Green in Newton's system is **G**.\n\nTherefore, the musical note G corresponds to the beginning of the specified range on Newton's colour circle.\n\n<<<G>>>"
