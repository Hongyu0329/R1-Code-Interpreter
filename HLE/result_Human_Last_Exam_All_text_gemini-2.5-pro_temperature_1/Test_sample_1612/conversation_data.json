    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the \"Triple Crown\" in Baseball**\nThe first crucial step is to recognize that the term \"Triple Crown\" in Major League Baseball can refer to two different achievements: one for batters (hitters) and one for pitchers. The question \"How many triple crowns winners are there\" is best answered by considering both types.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player wins this by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in the same season: **Batting Average (AVG)**, **Home Runs (HR)**, and **Runs Batted In (RBI)**.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher wins this by leading their respective league in three key pitching categories in the same season: **Wins (W)**, **Strikeouts (SO)**, and **Earned Run Average (ERA)**.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners**\nWe need to count the number of individual players who have won the Batting Triple Crown, not the number of times it has been won. For example, Ted Williams won it twice, but he counts as one winner.\n\n*   **Total Batting Triple Crown Achievements:** 17\n*   **Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\n    1.  Paul Hines (1878)\n    2.  Tip O'Neill (1887)\n    3.  Hugh Duffy (1894)\n    4.  Nap Lajoie (1901)\n    5.  Ty Cobb (1909)\n    6.  Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n    7.  Chuck Klein (1933)\n    8.  Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n    9.  Lou Gehrig (1934)\n    10. Joe Medwick (1937)\n    11. Ted Williams (1942, 1947)\n    12. Mickey Mantle (1956)\n    13. Frank Robinson (1966)\n    14. Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n    15. Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\nThere have been **15** unique players who have won the Batting Triple Crown.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners**\nSimilarly, we count the individual pitchers who have achieved the Pitching Triple Crown. Players like Walter Johnson and Sandy Koufax, who won it three times each, are each counted as one winner.\n\n*   **Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners:** A comprehensive list of unique winners includes legends from the early days of baseball to the modern era. Counting these individual players gives us a total of **27** unique pitchers.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Winners**\nTo find the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we add the number of unique batting winners to the number of unique pitching winners. Since no player in history has ever won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown, there is no overlap between the two lists.\n\n*   Total Winners = (Unique Batting Winners) + (Unique Pitching Winners)\n*   Total Winners = 15 + 27 = 42\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Two Types of Crowns:** The most common mistake is forgetting that there is a Pitching Triple Crown in addition to the more famous Batting Triple Crown.\n2.  **Unique Winners vs. Occurrences:** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which means counting each player only once, regardless of how many times they won the award.\n3.  **League-Specific Achievement:** The Triple Crown is awarded for leading a specific league (AL or NL), not the entire MLB.\n4.  **Historical Data:** The count includes winners from the 19th century (pre-1901 \"modern era\"), whose achievements are officially recognized by MLB. It also includes the winner from the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.\n5.  **No Overlap:** No player is on both the batting and pitching lists, so the final calculation is a simple sum.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBy systematically identifying the two types of Triple Crowns, counting the unique players who have won each, and summing the totals, we arrive at the final number.\n\n*   Number of unique Batting Triple Crown winners: 15\n*   Number of unique Pitching Triple Crown winners: 27\n*   Total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history: 15 + 27 = 42\n\n<<<42>>>"
