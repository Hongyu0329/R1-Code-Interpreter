    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and the historical context.**\nThe question is about the Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his \"first major defeat\" in Vietnam. This places the event during the Ming-Hồ War (1406–1407) or the subsequent Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427) led by Lê Lợi, which ultimately ended the Ming domination of Vietnam.\n\n**Step 2: Differentiate between Mu Sheng's campaigns.**\nMu Sheng was involved in the initial, successful invasion of Vietnam in 1406-1407 which overthrew the Hồ dynasty. Therefore, his \"first major defeat\" must have occurred later, during the Vietnamese resistance. The most significant resistance was the Lam Sơn uprising.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the major battles of the Lam Sơn uprising involving Ming commanders.**\nThe two most decisive battles of the war occurred in late 1426 and late 1427.\n*   **Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (1426):** The Ming forces were commanded by Wang Tong (王通). They suffered a catastrophic defeat near modern-day Hanoi. Mu Sheng was not the commander in this battle; he was in Yunnan at the time and was ordered to lead a relief army *after* this defeat.\n*   **Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang (1427):** This was the final campaign of the war. The Ming emperor sent two large relief armies to save the besieged Wang Tong.\n    1.  An army from Guangxi, led by Liu Sheng (柳升).\n    2.  An army from Yunnan, led by **Mu Sheng**.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint Mu Sheng's specific defeat.**\nLiu Sheng's army was the first to enter Vietnam and was ambushed and annihilated at the Chi Lăng Pass (in modern Lạng Sơn Province) in October 1427. When news of Liu Sheng's death and defeat reached Mu Sheng, his army became demoralized. The Vietnamese forces, led by generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, then intercepted Mu Sheng's army.\n\nMu Sheng's army was attacked and decisively defeated at **Lãnh Câu Pass (ải Lãnh Câu)** and **Đan Xá**. Faced with a complete rout, Mu Sheng abandoned his heavy equipment and fled with the remnants of his army back to Yunnan. This was his first and only major defeat as the supreme commander of an expeditionary army during this conflict.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the modern location of the battle.**\nThe battles at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá took place along the Thao River (sông Thao). Historical and geographical analysis places these locations within the territory of the modern-day **Phú Thọ Province**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish Mu Sheng's defeat from Liu Sheng's defeat. Liu Sheng was defeated at Chi Lăng Pass in Lạng Sơn Province. Mu Sheng was defeated shortly after at Lãnh Câu in a different region.\n*   The term \"first major defeat\" refers to his role as a field commander in a specific campaign. While Ming forces had lost battles before, the defeat at Lãnh Câu was Mu Sheng's personal, significant military failure in the war.\n*   The location must be identified by its modern provincial name, which requires mapping historical battle sites to current administrative divisions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGeneral Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred at the battles of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in 1427. These historical sites are located in what is now Phú Thọ Province in Vietnam.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
