No, it is not possible. A scaling argument (Derrick's theorem) shows that any localized solution in this 3D Hamiltonian would be unstable to either collapse or infinite expansion. The exchange energy scales with the soliton size $\lambda$ as $\lambda^1$, while the DMI energy scales as $\lambda^2$. This scaling behavior does not permit the existence of a stable energy minimum at a finite size.
