    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to reconstruct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\".\n    *   A **spectral volume** (also known as a hyperspectral data cube) is a 3D data set with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). It represents the spectrum of light for every pixel in a scene.\n    *   \"From a **single image**\" means the entire dataset must be captured in one snapshot on a 2D sensor. This technique is known as snapshot hyperspectral imaging.\n\n2.  **Understand the Method:** The question specifies using \"computed tomography\" (CT) principles. This refers to the technique called Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    *   **Computed Tomography (CT)** is a mathematical method for reconstructing a volumetric object from its projections. For example, a 3D medical scan is reconstructed from many 2D X-ray images (projections) taken from different angles.\n    *   In **CTIS**, the 3D spectral volume (x, y, λ) is the \"object\" we want to reconstruct. The single 2D image captured by the sensor is a multiplexed projection of this 3D data cube. The CT algorithm then unscrambles this 2D image to recover the 3D cube.\n\n3.  **Understand the Role of the Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical element that disperses light according to its wavelength.\n    *   When an image passes through a grating, it creates multiple copies of the image corresponding to different diffraction orders (m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...).\n    *   The zeroth order (m=0) is undispersed. It's a panchromatic (black and white) version of the scene.\n    *   The non-zero orders (m ≠ 0) are dispersed. The amount of spatial shift in the image is proportional to the wavelength (λ) and the order number (m). This dispersion is what encodes the spectral information into spatial position on the detector.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Tomographic Requirement:** The core principle of CT is that reconstruction is only possible if you have projections from multiple different angles. A single projection is not enough to uniquely determine the internal structure of an object.\n    *   In CTIS, each diffraction order creates a different projection of the (x, y, λ) data cube onto the 2D detector. To successfully reconstruct the cube, we need a set of projections that are sufficiently diverse, i.e., they must correspond to different \"viewing angles\" of the data cube.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Case of One (1D) Grating:**\n    *   A standard diffraction grating is a 1D grating, meaning its periodic structure is along one dimension (e.g., a series of parallel lines). It disperses light along a single axis (perpendicular to the lines).\n    *   If we use a single 1D grating, all the dispersed diffraction orders (m = ±1, ±2, ...) lie along a single line on the detector.\n    *   In the language of tomography, all the \"projections\" are taken from within a single plane. This is a classic case of \"limited-angle tomography\". The resulting reconstruction problem is ill-posed because there is a \"missing cone\" of information in the data's Fourier space. It is impossible to uniquely and reliably reconstruct a general 3D spectral volume from this information.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Case of Two (1D) Gratings:**\n    *   To overcome the \"missing cone\" problem, we need projections from different, non-coplanar angles.\n    *   This can be achieved by dispersing light in two dimensions (e.g., both horizontally and vertically).\n    *   The standard way to do this is to use two 1D diffraction gratings, oriented orthogonally (at 90 degrees) to each other. This is often called a \"crossed grating\".\n    *   This setup produces a 2D grid of diffraction orders on the detector (e.g., orders are indexed by `(m_x, m_y)`). The different orders like (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), etc., are not collinear.\n    *   These non-collinear orders correspond to projections from sufficiently diverse angles, allowing the tomographic algorithm to sample the object's Fourier space more completely and perform a successful reconstruction of the full spectral volume.\n\n7.  **Conclusion on the Minimum Number:**\n    *   One 1D grating is insufficient.\n    *   Two orthogonal 1D gratings are sufficient.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of fundamental grating functions required is two.\n    *   It is important to note that a \"2D grating\" is often fabricated as a single optical component. However, its function is that of two superimposed orthogonal gratings. The question asks for the \"minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary to construct...\", which points to the fundamental requirement of the physics, not just the component count. The fundamental requirement is for two independent axes of dispersion, which is functionally equivalent to two gratings.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   The constraint \"from a single image\" is crucial. It rules out solutions where you might rotate a single 1D grating and take multiple pictures. All information must be captured simultaneously.\n*   The term \"full spectral volume\" implies a general case without strong prior assumptions about the scene, for which a robust reconstruction is required. This rules out the ill-posed 1D grating case.\n*   The distinction between a physical component and a fundamental function is key. While a 2D grating is one component, it performs the function of two orthogonal gratings. In physics and engineering problems about \"minimums\", the answer often relates to the fundamental principles. The fundamental principle of tomography requires multiple, non-coplanar views, which in this context requires two dispersion axes.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n1. A single 1D grating provides dispersion along only one axis. This leads to an ill-posed tomographic problem with a \"missing cone\" of data, making reconstruction of a general spectral volume impossible from a single snapshot.\n2. To make the problem well-posed, dispersion along a second, independent axis is required.\n3. The simplest way to achieve dispersion along two independent axes is to use two orthogonal 1D gratings.\n4. Therefore, the minimum number of gratings necessary for the principle to work is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
