    "This problem asks for the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve $C$ defined over a valuation field $K$, under the crucial assumption that its Jacobian variety $J(C)$ has good reduction.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the conditions\n\n1.  **Stable Reduction:** A curve $C/K$ has a stable reduction, which is a stable curve $\\mathcal{C}_k$ over the residue field $k$. A stable curve of genus $g \\ge 2$ is a connected, reduced curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes), and which has a finite automorphism group.\n\n2.  **Jacobian with Good Reduction:** Let $R$ be the valuation ring of $K$. The condition that the Jacobian $J(C)$ has good reduction means that its Néron model over $R$ is an abelian scheme. The special fiber of this Néron model, denoted $\\mathcal{A}_k$, is an abelian variety of dimension $g=4$.\n\n3.  **Connecting the conditions:** The structure of the special fiber of the stable model of the curve, $\\mathcal{C}_k$, is constrained by the good reduction of its Jacobian. Let $\\mathcal{C}_k = \\bigcup_{i=1}^n C_i$ be the decomposition of the stable reduction into its irreducible components. The special fiber of the Néron model of the Jacobian is related to the geometry of $\\mathcal{C}_k$. The identity component of the special fiber of the Néron model is an extension of the product of the Jacobians of the normalizations of the components by a torus. The dimension of this torus is given by the first Betti number, $b_1(\\Gamma)$, of the dual graph $\\Gamma$ of $\\mathcal{C}_k$.\n\n    The dual graph $\\Gamma$ has a vertex for each irreducible component $C_i$ and an edge for each node connecting two distinct components.\n\n    Since the special fiber $\\mathcal{A}_k$ is an abelian variety, its toric part must be trivial. This implies that the dimension of the torus, $b_1(\\Gamma)$, must be 0. For a connected graph, $b_1(\\Gamma) = 0$ means that the graph is a tree.\n\n### Step 2: The genus formula\n\nThe arithmetic genus of a nodal curve $\\mathcal{C}_k$ is given by the formula:\n$g = p_a(\\mathcal{C}_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (g_i + \\delta_i) + b_1(\\Gamma)$\nwhere:\n*   $g_i$ is the geometric genus of the component $C_i$ (the genus of its normalization).\n*   $\\delta_i$ is the number of self-intersection nodes on the component $C_i$.\n*   $b_1(\\Gamma)$ is the first Betti number of the dual graph.\n\nSince $g=4$ and $b_1(\\Gamma)=0$, the formula simplifies to:\n$4 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (g_i + \\delta_i)$\n\nThis means the sum of the \"partial genera\" (geometric genus plus the number of self-nodes) of all components must equal 4.\n\n### Step 3: The stability condition\n\nFor $\\mathcal{C}_k$ to be a stable curve, each of its components $C_i$ must satisfy a stability condition. Let $d_i$ be the degree of the vertex corresponding to $C_i$ in the dual graph $\\Gamma$ (i.e., the number of nodes connecting $C_i$ to other components). The total number of special points on $C_i$ is $2\\delta_i + d_i$.\n*   If $g_i=0$ (the component is rational), it must have at least 3 special points: $2\\delta_i + d_i \\ge 3$.\n*   If $g_i=1$ (the component is elliptic), it must have at least 1 special point: $2\\delta_i + d_i \\ge 1$. This is always satisfied in a connected curve since $d_i \\ge 1$ or $\\delta_i \\ge 1$ (if $n=1$).\n\n### Step 4: Case-by-case enumeration\n\nWe classify the reduction types based on the number of irreducible components, $n$. For each $n$, the dual graph is a tree. Let $k_i = g_i + \\delta_i$.\n\n*   **n=1 (irreducible curve):** The dual graph is a single vertex. $d_1=0$. The formula gives $k_1 = g_1 + \\delta_1 = 4$.\n    *   $g_1=4, \\delta_1=0$: Smooth genus 4 curve. (1 type)\n    *   $g_1=3, \\delta_1=1$: (1 type)\n    *   $g_1=2, \\delta_1=2$: (1 type)\n    *   $g_1=1, \\delta_1=3$: Stability: $2(3)+0 \\ge 1$. OK. (1 type)\n    *   $g_1=0, \\delta_1=4$: Stability: $2(4)+0 \\ge 3$. OK. (1 type)\n    Total for n=1: **5 types**.\n\n*   **n=2 (two components):** The dual graph is $C_1-C_2$, so $d_1=d_2=1$. The formula is $k_1+k_2=4$, with $k_i \\ge 1$.\n    *   Partition (3,1): Component 1 has $k_1=3$, Component 2 has $k_2=1$.\n        *   $k_1=3$: 4 possibilities for $(g_1,\\delta_1)$: (3,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,3). All stable.\n        *   $k_2=1$: 2 possibilities for $(g_2,\\delta_2)$: (1,0), (0,1). Both stable.\n        *   Total: $4 \\times 2 = 8$ types.\n    *   Partition (2,2): Both components have $k=2$.\n        *   $k=2$: 3 possibilities for $(g,\\delta)$: (2,0), (1,1), (0,2). All stable.\n        *   The number of unordered pairs is $\\binom{3}{2}+3 = 6$ types.\n    Total for n=2: $8+6 = \\textbf{14 types}$.\n\n*   **n=3 (three components):** The only tree is a chain $C_1-C_2-C_3$. $d_1=1, d_2=2, d_3=1$. The formula is $k_1+k_2+k_3=4$, so the partition must be (2,1,1).\n    *   Central component $C_2$ has $k_2=2$: 3 choices for $(g_2,\\delta_2)$. The two leaves $C_1,C_3$ have $k=1$. A pair of $k=1$ components has 3 choices. Total: $3 \\times 3 = 9$ types.\n    *   Central component $C_2$ has $k_2=1$: 2 choices. One leaf (say $C_1$) has $k_1=2$ (3 choices), the other leaf $C_3$ has $k_3=1$ (2 choices). Total: $2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12$ types.\n    Total for n=3: $9+12 = \\textbf{21 types}$.\n\n*   **n=4 (four components):** The dual graph is a tree. Possible partitions for $\\sum k_i=4$ are (1,1,1,1) or (1,1,2,0) which is impossible since $k_i \\ge 1$ or (1,1,1,1,0,0) also not right.\n    *   Partition (1,1,1,1): All components have $k_i=1$. Two possible trees: path $P_4$ and star $S_3$.\n        *   $P_4$: Distributing two component types (elliptic or rational-with-node) gives 9 distinct configurations.\n        *   $S_3$: Distributing the two types on the center and 3 leaves gives 8 distinct configurations.\n        *   Subtotal: $9+8=17$ types.\n    *   Partition with $k_i=0$: A component with $k_i=g_i+\\delta_i=0$ must have $g_i=0, \\delta_i=0$. For stability, its degree $d_i$ must be $\\ge 3$.\n        *   This is only possible for the central vertex of the star graph $S_3$ ($d=3$). Let this be $C_1$.\n        *   Then $k_2+k_3+k_4=4$. This must be a (2,1,1) partition for the three leaves.\n        *   One leaf has $k=2$ (3 choices). The other two leaves have $k=1$ (3 pair choices). Total: $3 \\times 3 = 9$ types.\n    Total for n=4: $17+9 = \\textbf{26 types}$.\n\n*   **n=5 (five components):** The formula $\\sum k_i=4$ implies at least one $k_i=0$.\n    *   Let one component be $k_1=0$, so $C_1(0,0)$ with $d_1 \\ge 3$. The other four components $C_{2..5}$ have $k_i=1$.\n    *   Trees on 5 vertices with a vertex of degree $\\ge 3$: the star graph $S_4$ (center has $d=4$) and a \"fork\" graph (one vertex has $d=3$).\n        *   $S_4$: Central component is $C_1(0,0)$. The 4 leaves are type $k=1$. There are 5 ways to assign elliptic/nodal-rational types to the 4 indistinguishable leaves.\n        *   Fork graph: The $d=3$ vertex is $C_1(0,0)$. The 4 neighbors can be assigned types in 12 distinct ways due to the graph's symmetries.\n    Total for n=5: $5+12 = \\textbf{17 types}$.\n\n*   **n=6 (six components):** We must have two components with $k_i=0$, say $C_1,C_2$, so they must have $d_1,d_2 \\ge 3$. The other four components have $k_i=1$.\n    *   There is exactly one tree on 6 vertices with two vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. It has two vertices of degree 3, and four leaves.\n    *   The two $d=3$ vertices are $C_1,C_2$. The four leaves have $k=1$. The symmetries of the graph lead to 6 ways to assign elliptic/nodal-rational types to the leaves.\n    Total for n=6: **6 types**.\n\n*   **n > 6:** For a curve with $n$ components to have $\\sum k_i=4$, it must have $m=n-4$ components with $k_i=0$. This requires $m$ vertices in the dual tree to have degree $d_i \\ge 3$. A graph-theoretic argument shows that for a tree on $n$ vertices, the number of leaves $n_1 \\ge n-2$. All leaves must be among the 4 components with $k_i=1$, so $n_1 \\le 4$. This gives $n-2 \\le 4 \\implies n \\le 6$. Thus, no such reductions exist for $n>6$.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSumming the number of types from each case:\nTotal = 5 (n=1) + 14 (n=2) + 21 (n=3) + 26 (n=4) + 17 (n=5) + 6 (n=6) = 89.\n\nThere are 89 distinct combinatorial types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n<<<89>>>"
