    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the integral.**\n    The question asks to evaluate the definite integral `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\n    This integral is of the form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`.\n\n2.  **Recall the integration formula.**\n    The integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` is a standard result. We know that the derivative of `ln|f(x)|` is `f'(x)/f(x)`.\n    Therefore, the indefinite integral is:\n    `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx = ln|f(x)| + C`\n\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.**\n    To evaluate the definite integral from `a` to `b`, we use the formula:\n    `∫[a, b] (f'(x)/f(x)) dx = [ln|f(x)|]` from `a` to `b`\n    `= ln|f(b)| - ln|f(a)|`\n\n4.  **Apply the formula to the specific problem.**\n    In this case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`, `a = 0`, and `b = 1`.\n    So, the value of the integral `V` is:\n    `V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n5.  **Calculate F₃(0).**\n    We need to evaluate the function `F₃(x)` at `x = 0` by following the chain of definitions:\n    *   `F₀(x) = x` => `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))` => `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))` => `F₂(0) = e^0 = 1`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))` => `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate F₃(1).**\n    Similarly, we evaluate `F₃(x)` at `x = 1`:\n    *   `F₀(x) = x` => `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))` => `F₁(1) = sin(1)` (Note: The argument of `sin` is in radians)\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))` => `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))` => `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n7.  **Check the sign of F₃(x) to handle the absolute value.**\n    *   For `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is between `sin(0)=0` and `sin(1)≈0.84`. So `sin(x) ≥ 0`.\n    *   `e^(sin(x))` is always positive, and specifically `e^(sin(x)) ≥ e^0 = 1`.\n    *   `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to `2`.\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always greater than or equal to `ln(2)`.\n    *   Since `ln(2)` is positive, `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`.\n    *   Therefore, we can drop the absolute value signs: `|F₃(x)| = F₃(x)`.\n\n8.  **Substitute the values back into the expression for V.**\n    `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n    `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\n9.  **Calculate the numerical value of V.**\n    We use a calculator to find the numerical values (using radians for `sin(1)`).\n    *   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147`\n    *   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.31977`\n    *   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.31977 = 3.31977`\n    *   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.31977) ≈ 1.20000`\n    *   `ln(2) ≈ 0.69315`\n    Now substitute these into the expression for `V`:\n    *   `V ≈ ln(1.20000) - ln(0.69315)`\n    *   `V ≈ 0.18232 - (-0.36651)`\n    *   `V ≈ 0.54883`\n\n10. **Calculate 10000 * V and find the closest integer.**\n    *   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54883 = 5488.3`\n    *   The closest integer to `5488.3` is `5488`.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\nThe value of the integral is `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\nUsing logarithm properties, `V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`.\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ 1.2000007`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931472`\n*   `V = ln(1.2000007) - ln(0.6931472) ≈ 0.1823219 - (-0.3665129) ≈ 0.5488348`\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.5488348 = 5488.348`\nThe closest integer is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
