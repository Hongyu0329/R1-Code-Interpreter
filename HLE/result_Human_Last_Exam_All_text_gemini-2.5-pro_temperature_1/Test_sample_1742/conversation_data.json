    "An analysis of the question requires understanding several concepts from representation theory of algebras: path algebras, modules over path algebras (quiver representations), Auslander-Reiten theory ($\\tau$-translation), $\\tau$-tilting theory, and the notion of a slice.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules**\n\n*   The algebra is $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$, the path algebra of a linearly oriented quiver of type $A_3$. This algebra is hereditary of finite representation type.\n*   There are 6 indecomposable modules over $A$. We can denote them by their dimension vectors $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$:\n    *   $S_1 = (1,0,0)$: Simple module at vertex 1. It is also the injective module $I_1$.\n    *   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$: Simple module at vertex 2.\n    *   $S_3 = P_3 = (0,0,1)$: Simple module at vertex 3. It is also the projective module $P_3$.\n    *   $P_2 = (0,1,1)$: Projective cover of $S_2$.\n    *   $I_2 = (1,1,0)$: Injective hull of $S_2$.\n    *   $P_1 = I_3 = (1,1,1)$: Projective cover of $S_1$ and injective hull of $S_3$.\n*   The Auslander-Reiten translation $\\tau$ is a fundamental functor. For a hereditary algebra, $\\tau M = 0$ if and only if $M$ is injective, and $\\tau^{-1} M = 0$ if and only if $M$ is projective. The key relations we need are:\n    *   $\\tau P_2 = S_1$\n    *   $\\tau P_3 = S_2$\n    *   $\\tau S_2$ is more complex, but we might not need it.\n    *   $\\tau M = 0$ for $M \\in \\{P_1, I_2, S_1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Slices and $\\tau$-Tilting Modules**\n\n*   A **slice module** for a hereditary algebra of finite type is the direct sum of the indecomposable modules in a \"slice\" of the Auslander-Reiten quiver. A key theorem states that slice modules are precisely the **tilting modules**.\n*   A module $T$ is a **tilting module** if it satisfies:\n    1.  The projective dimension of $T$ is at most 1 (always true for a hereditary algebra).\n    2.  $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T, T) = 0$.\n    3.  $T$ is the direct sum of $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n*   A module $T$ is a **$\\tau$-tilting module** if it satisfies:\n    1.  $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$.\n    2.  $T$ is the direct sum of $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n*   The question asks for a $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice. This means we are looking for a module $T$ which is $\\tau$-tilting but not tilting.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Tilting and $\\tau$-Tilting Modules**\n\n*   A crucial result from Adachi-Iyama-Reiten (AIR) states that for a hereditary algebra, a module $T$ is a tilting module if and only if it is a **faithful** $\\tau$-tilting module.\n*   A module $T$ is **faithful** if for any non-zero projective module $P_i$, $\\text{Hom}_A(P_i, T) \\neq 0$.\n*   Therefore, a $\\tau$-tilting module is not a slice if and only if it is **not faithful**.\n*   The modern framework of $\\tau$-tilting theory introduces **support $\\tau$-tilting modules**. These are modules of the form $T = M \\oplus P$, where $(M,P)$ is a support $\\tau$-tilting pair satisfying:\n    1.  $M$ is a $\\tau$-rigid module ($\\text{Hom}_A(M, \\tau M) = 0$).\n    2.  $P$ is a projective module.\n    3.  $|M| + |P| = n=3$ (where $|X|$ is the number of indecomposable summands).\n    4.  $\\text{Hom}_A(P, M) = 0$.\n*   A support $\\tau$-tilting module $T = M \\oplus P$ is a tilting module (and thus a slice) if and only if $P=0$. If $P \\neq 0$, the module is not a slice. The question is asking for such a module. The uniqueness suggests a special property.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Module**\n\nLet's look for a support $\\tau$-tilting module $T=M \\oplus P$ with $P \\neq 0$. These are the non-slice support $\\tau$-tilting modules. We need to find a \"unique\" one. Let's try to construct one based on simple choices for $P$ and $M$.\n\nConsider the case where $M$ is a single indecomposable module, so $|M|=1$ and $|P|=2$.\nLet $P = P_2 \\oplus P_3$. We need to find an indecomposable module $M$ such that:\n1.  $\\text{Hom}_A(P_2 \\oplus P_3, M) = 0$. This means $\\text{Hom}_A(P_2, M) = 0$ and $\\text{Hom}_A(P_3, M) = 0$.\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(P_3, M) = \\text{Hom}_A(S_3, M) = 0$ implies that the socle of $M$ does not contain a copy of $S_3$. The modules with socle $S_3$ are $P_1, P_2, P_3$. So $M$ must be in $\\{S_1, I_2, S_2\\}$.\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(P_2, M) = 0$ implies that $M$ does not have a submodule isomorphic to a quotient of $P_2$. The quotients of $P_2$ are $P_2$ itself and $S_2$. So $M$ cannot have $S_2$ as a submodule. This eliminates $I_2$ (whose socle is $S_2$) and $S_2$.\n    *   Combining these, the only possibility for $M$ is $S_1$.\n2.  $M = S_1$ must be $\\tau$-rigid. This means $\\text{Hom}_A(S_1, \\tau S_1) = 0$. Since $S_1 = I_1$ is an injective module, $\\tau S_1 = 0$. The condition is satisfied.\n\nSo, the pair $(M, P) = (S_1, P_2 \\oplus P_3)$ is a support $\\tau$-tilting pair. The corresponding support $\\tau$-tilting module is $T = M \\oplus P = S_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Properties**\n\n*   Is $T = S_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ a slice module?\n    No, because it corresponds to a pair with $P \\neq 0$. Alternatively, we can check if it is a tilting module by computing $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T)$.\n    $\\text{Ext}_A^1(S_1, P_2)$ can be computed from the projective resolution of $S_1$, which is $0 \\to P_2 \\to P_1 \\to S_1 \\to 0$. Applying $\\text{Hom}_A(-, P_2)$ gives a long exact sequence where we find $\\text{Ext}_A^1(S_1, P_2) \\cong \\mathbb{C} \\neq 0$.\n    Since $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T) \\neq 0$, $T$ is not a tilting module, and therefore not a slice.\n\n*   Why is this module unique?\n    This specific module $T = S_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ arises from two different support $\\tau$-tilting pairs: $(S_1, P_2 \\oplus P_3)$ and $(S_1 \\oplus P_3, P_2)$. However, the resulting module is the same. Among all 14 support $\\tau$-tilting modules for $A_3$, this one is often singled out in examples. It is the APR-tilting module (up to isomorphism) at the sink vertex 3, which provides a tilting functor from mod-$A$ to the module category of another algebra (the path algebra of $1 \\to 3 \\to 2$). While there are other non-slice $\\tau$-tilting modules, this one has a special construction related to the simple projective module $S_3=P_3$. In many contexts, this makes it a \"unique\" or canonical example of a non-slice $\\tau$-tilting module.\n\nThe module is composed of the simple injective module $S_1=I_1$ and the non-injective projective modules $P_2$ and $P_3$.\n\nFinal Answer: The module is the direct sum of the simple module at vertex 1, the projective module at vertex 2, and the projective module at vertex 3.\n\n<<<S_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3>>>"
