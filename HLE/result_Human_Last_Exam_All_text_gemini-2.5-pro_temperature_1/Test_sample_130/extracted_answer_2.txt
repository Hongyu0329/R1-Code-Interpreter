The edges of any closed objects will first be smoothed (convex corners are eroded, concave corners are filled). Then, these smoothed edges will move inwards, causing the objects to shrink and eventually disappear. The image will converge to a constant state (all black or all white). The only edges that can survive are those that form a perfectly straight line dividing the entire image, as they are stable under this operation.
