    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core of the question is to find the specific year when a person, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, publicly adopted or identified with the name \"Azikiwe\". This question operates on the premise that such an event actually occurred.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Full Name of the Individual**\nThe first and most crucial step is to verify the official and publicly known name of the person in question. Goodluck Jonathan served as the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015. His universally recognized full name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Name \"Azikiwe\" in the Context of Nigerian Politics**\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" is a very prominent name in Nigerian history. It is the surname of Dr. **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was a leading figure in Nigeria's independence movement and served as the first President of Nigeria from 1963 to 1966.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate the Claim of a Name Change or Public Identification**\nThe next logical step is to search for any credible evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identified himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This involves checking:\n*   Official government records and publications during his presidency.\n*   Reputable news archives (both Nigerian and international).\n*   Official biographies and autobiographical information.\n*   Public speeches and statements made by him.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Findings**\nA thorough review of available public records, news reports, and historical documents reveals **no evidence** that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever formally or informally adopted the name \"Azikiwe\" or publicly identified himself with it. His name has consistently been recorded and used as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not one of his given names, nor did he ever add it.\n\n**Step 6: Formulate a Conclusion**\nThe premise of the question is incorrect. The event described—Goodluck Jonathan publicly identifying as Azikiwe—never happened. The confusion likely arises from the fact that both Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe were presidents of Nigeria.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Verifying the Premise:** Before searching for a \"when,\" it is essential to first confirm \"if\" the event ever took place. Many questions are based on false or inaccurate assumptions.\n2.  **Name Confusion:** In politics, names can sometimes be conflated. It's important to distinguish between a person's actual name and a potential nickname, honorific, or simple error.\n3.  **Source Credibility:** Rely on official sources, academic papers, and established news organizations rather than social media or unsubstantiated claims.\n4.  **Absence of Evidence:** Concluding that something never happened is based on the comprehensive absence of evidence from reliable sources where such evidence would be expected to exist. In this case, a public identification by a head of state would have been a widely reported event.\n\nBased on this analysis, the question cannot be answered with a year because the event never occurred.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, and the name \"Azikiwe\" belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. The premise of the question is incorrect.>>>"
