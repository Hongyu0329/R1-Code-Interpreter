    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the topological space X**\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which can be arranged as the columns of a matrix $M = (v_1, v_2) \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of unit area means $|\\det(M)| = 1$. The set of such matrices is $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{ A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(A) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\nTwo bases $M_1$ and $M_2$ generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by a change of basis matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $M_2 = M_1 A$.\nTherefore, the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is the quotient space of bases by this equivalence relation:\n$X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate X to the space of oriented lattices Y**\nAn oriented lattice is a lattice with a chosen orientation. This corresponds to requiring the basis $(v_1, v_2)$ to be positively oriented, i.e., $\\det(v_1, v_2) = 1$. The group of matrices with determinant 1 is $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nTwo oriented bases $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ define the same oriented lattice if $M_2 = M_1 A$ where $A$ preserves orientation, i.e., $\\det(A)=1$. So $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe moduli space of oriented unit-area lattices is $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThere is a natural forgetful map from oriented lattices to unoriented lattices, which corresponds to a map $p: Y \\to X$. An unoriented lattice can be obtained from exactly two oriented lattices (one for each orientation). This means that $X$ is the quotient of $Y$ by an involution $i: Y \\to Y$ that reverses the orientation.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the fundamental group and homology of Y**\nThe space $Y$ is intimately related to the modular group and hyperbolic geometry. The group $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ acts on the upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z)>0\\}$ by fractional linear transformations. The stabilizer of $i \\in \\mathcal{H}$ is $SO(2)$. This gives the fibration $SO(2) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathcal{H}$. Since $\\mathcal{H}$ is contractible, $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homotopy equivalent to $SO(2) \\cong S^1$. Thus $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe space $Y$ is the quotient of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ by the discrete subgroup $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. In fact, $Y$ can be identified with the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $M = \\mathcal{H}/PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n$Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong PSL(2, \\mathbb{R})/PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = T^1(M)$.\nThe fundamental group $\\pi_1(Y)$ can be determined from the long exact sequence associated with the covering $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to Y$ with deck group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nA more convenient model is the covering $PSL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to Y$. The fundamental group sequence for this covering is:\n$1 \\to \\pi_1(PSL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\pi_1(Y) \\to PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$.\nWe have $\\pi_1(PSL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So we have a central extension:\n$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(Y) \\to PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$.\nThe group $\\pi_1(Y)$ is known to be isomorphic to the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$, which has the presentation $\\langle a, b \\mid aba=bab \\rangle$.\nThe first homology group $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(Y) = B_3$.\n$(B_3)_{ab} = \\langle a, b \\mid aba=bab, ab=ba \\rangle$. The relation $ab=ba$ simplifies $aba=bab$ to $a^2b=ab^2$, which implies $a=b$ (since we are in a group). Thus, the abelianization is generated by a single element $a$ with no relations.\n$H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the homology of X**\nThe space $X$ is the quotient of $Y$ by the orientation-reversing involution $i$. Topologically, $Y$ is a 2-fold (branched) cover of $X$. The fundamental group of the orbifold $X$, $\\pi_1^{orb}(X)$, fits into a short exact sequence:\n$1 \\to \\pi_1(Y) \\to \\pi_1^{orb}(X) \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\to 1$.\nThe first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1^{orb}(X)$.\nThe extension is a semi-direct product $\\pi_1^{orb}(X) \\cong \\pi_1(Y) \\rtimes_\\phi \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, where $\\phi$ describes the action of the involution on $\\pi_1(Y)$.\nThe involution $i$ on $Y$ acts on the homology $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$. Geometrically, $Y$ is a circle bundle over the orbifold $M$, and the generator of $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ can be represented by a fiber circle. The orientation-reversing involution on the space of lattices reverses the orientation of these fibers. This means the induced map $i_*: H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is multiplication by $-1$.\nThe abelianization of a semi-direct product $N \\rtimes H$ is given by $(N_{ab})_H \\oplus H_{ab}$, where $(N_{ab})_H$ are the coinvariants of the $H$-action on $N_{ab}$.\nHere, $N = \\pi_1(Y) = B_3$ and $H = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n$N_{ab} = H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$H_{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe action of the non-trivial element of $H$ on $N_{ab}=\\mathbb{Z}$ is multiplication by $-1$.\nThe coinvariants are $(\\mathbb{Z})_H = \\mathbb{Z} / \\{k - (-1)k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\mathbb{Z} / \\{2k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nPutting it all together:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = (\\pi_1^{orb}(X))_{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z})_{\\mathbb{Z}/2} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the direct sum of two copies of the cyclic group of order 2."
