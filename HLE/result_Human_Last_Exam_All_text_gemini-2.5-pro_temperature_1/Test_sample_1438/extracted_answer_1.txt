The value of the measure is not a single number but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration. For a single Grassmann variable $\eta$, the measure $d\eta$ is defined by two fundamental rules that ensure consistency with the Pauli exclusion principle (which is encoded in the property $\eta^2=0$): (1) The integral of a constant is zero: $\int d\eta \, 1 = 0$. (2) The integral of the variable itself is normalized to one: $\int d\eta \, \eta = 1$.
