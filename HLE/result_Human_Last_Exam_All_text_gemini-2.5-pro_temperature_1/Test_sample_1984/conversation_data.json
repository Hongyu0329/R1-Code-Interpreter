    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the constant solutions of the differential equation. They occur when $x'(t) = 0$. So we need to solve the algebraic equation:\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out a $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x_0$, we can analyze the sign of the derivative of the right-hand side function, $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$, evaluated at $x_0$. Let's call this derivative $f'(x)$.\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\nThe stability criterion is as follows:\n*   If $f'(x_0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x_0$ is stable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) > 0$, the equilibrium point $x_0$ is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need to use another method.\n\nLet's test our two equilibrium points:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the behavior of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$. We can analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n    The term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative. It is positive for $x \\neq 1$ and zero for $x=1$. Therefore, for $x \\neq 1$, the sign of $f(x)$ is determined by the sign of $-x$.\n    *   Consider a point slightly to the left of $x=1$, for example, $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number. Here, $x$ is positive (assuming $\\epsilon < 1$), so $-x$ is negative. Thus, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2 < 0$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing and moving away from $x=1$.\n    *   Consider a point slightly to the right of $x=1$, for example, $x = 1 + \\epsilon$. Here, $x$ is positive, so $-x$ is negative. Thus, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2 < 0$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing and moving towards $x=1$.\n\n    Since solutions starting from the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. (It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium point, which is a type of unstable equilibrium).\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of stable equilibrium points**\n\nFrom the stability analysis in Step 2, we found that there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final value**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression, we get:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n**Careful points to note:**\n*   Properly factoring the polynomial to find all equilibrium points.\n*   Knowing the stability criteria based on the derivative of the function $f(x)$.\n*   Knowing how to handle the inconclusive case where $f'(x_0) = 0$. This requires analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point.\n*   Understanding that for an equilibrium to be stable, solutions on *both* sides must converge to it. If solutions on even one side move away, it is not a stable equilibrium.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$m = 1$\n$m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
