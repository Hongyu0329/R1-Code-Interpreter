    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A finite set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses for all elements.\n*   **Product-free set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any `a, b ∈ S` (possibly `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S.S = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximal by inclusion product-free set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Set of size 2:** We are looking for a set `S = {a, b}` with `a ≠ b`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the conditions for S = {a, b}\n\n**1. Product-free condition:**\nFor `S = {a, b}` to be product-free, the set of products `S.S = {a², ab, ba, b²}` must not contain `a` or `b`.\n*   `a² ≠ a` and `b² ≠ b` imply `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n*   `ab ≠ a` and `ba ≠ a` imply `b ≠ e`.\n*   `ab ≠ b` and `ba ≠ b` imply `a ≠ e`.\n*   We also need `a² ≠ b` and `b² ≠ a`.\n\nSo, the necessary conditions for `S = {a, b}` to be product-free are:\n`a ≠ e`, `b ≠ e`, `a² ≠ b`, and `b² ≠ a`.\n\n**2. Maximality condition:**\nFor `S = {a, b}` to be maximal, for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` must not be product-free.\nSince `S` is already product-free, any product in `S'.S'` that is also in `S'` must involve `g`.\nThe products involving `g` are `ag`, `ga`, `bg`, `gb`, and `g²`.\nSo, for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, at least one of these products must be an element of `S' = {a, b, g}`.\n\nLet's break this down for an arbitrary `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`:\nAt least one of the following must hold:\n*   `ag ∈ {a, b, g}` which implies `g=e`, `g=a⁻¹b`, or `a=e` (not possible).\n*   `ga ∈ {a, b, g}` which implies `g=e`, `g=ba⁻¹`, or `a=e` (not possible).\n*   `bg ∈ {a, b, g}` which implies `g=e`, `g=b⁻¹a`, or `b=e` (not possible).\n*   `gb ∈ {a, b, g}` which implies `g=e`, `g=ab⁻¹`, or `b=e` (not possible).\n*   `g² ∈ {a, b, g}` which implies `g²=a`, `g²=b`, or `g=e`.\n\nAlso, it's possible that `g` itself is a product of elements from `S`. This happens when we test an element `g` from `S.S`. For `g ∈ S.S`, let's say `g=ab`, then `S ∪ {ab}` is not product-free because `ab` is a product of elements from the set.\n\nSo, for any `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, one of the following must be true:\n1.  `g ∈ S.S = {a², ab, ba, b²}`\n2.  `g ∈ {e, a⁻¹b, ba⁻¹, b⁻¹a, ab⁻¹}`\n3.  `g² = a` or `g² = b`\n\nThis means the entire set `G \\ {a, b}` must be contained in the union of the sets defined by these conditions. This is a very strong constraint, suggesting that `|G|` must be small.\n\n### Step 3: Test small groups (up to isomorphism)\n\nWe can now test finite groups of small order.\n\n*   `|G| < 4`: No group has a set of two non-identity elements.\n*   `G = C₃ = {e, x, x²}`: The only possible set is `S = {x, x²}`. `S.S = {x², e, x}`. `S ∩ S.S = {x, x²} ≠ ∅`. Not product-free. So `C₃` is not a solution.\n*   `G = C₄ = {e, x, x², x³}`: Let `S = {x, x³}`. `S.S = {x², e}`. `S ∩ S.S = ∅`. So, `S` is product-free.\n    For maximality, check `G \\ S = {e, x²}`.\n    - `g=e`: `S ∪ {e}` is not product-free because `x*e = x`.\n    - `g=x²`: `S ∪ {x²}` is not product-free because `x*x = x²`.\n    Thus, `S = {x, x³}` is a maximal product-free set. `C₄` is a solution.\n*   `G = V₄ = {e, a, b, c}` (Klein four-group): Let `S = {a, b}`. `S.S = {a²=e, ab=c, ba=c, b²=e} = {e, c}`. `S ∩ S.S = ∅`. Product-free.\n    For maximality, check `G \\ S = {e, c}`.\n    - `g=e`: `S ∪ {e}` is not product-free.\n    - `g=c`: `S ∪ {c}` is not product-free because `ab=c`.\n    Thus, `S = {a, b}` is a maximal product-free set. `V₄` is a solution.\n*   `G = C₅ = {e, x, x², x³, x⁴}`: Let `S = {x, x⁴}` (i.e., `{x, x⁻¹}`). `S.S = {x², e, x³}`. Product-free.\n    For maximality, check `G \\ S = {e, x², x³}`.\n    - `g=e`: Not product-free.\n    - `g=x²`: Not product-free as `x*x = x²`.\n    - `g=x³`: Not product-free as `x⁴*x⁴ = x⁸ = x³`.\n    Thus, `S = {x, x⁴}` is a maximal product-free set. `C₅` is a solution.\n*   `G = S₃ = {e, r, r², s, sr, sr²}` (Dihedral group of order 6): Let `S = {r, s}`. `r` has order 3, `s` has order 2. `S.S = {r², e, rs, sr}`. This is disjoint from `S`, so it's product-free.\n    For maximality, check `G \\ S = {e, r², rs, sr, sr²}`.\n    - `g=e`: Not product-free.\n    - `g=r²`: Not product-free as `r*r = r²`.\n    - `g=rs`: Not product-free as `r*s = rs`.\n    - `g=sr`: Not product-free as `r*(sr) = r(r²s) = r³s = s`.\n    - `g=sr²`: Not product-free as `(sr²)*r = s*r³ = s`.\n    Thus, `S = {r, s}` is a maximal product-free set. `S₃` is a solution.\n*   `G = C₆`: It can be shown that any product-free set of size 2 in `C₆` is a subset of the larger product-free set `{x, x³, x⁵}`, and is therefore not maximal.\n*   `G = C₇`: Similar to `C₅`, let `S = {x, x⁻¹} = {x, x⁶}`. `S.S = {x², e, x⁵}`. Product-free.\n    For maximality, we must check for all `g=x^k` where `k ∈ {2,3,4,5}`.\n    - `g=x²`: `x*x=x²`.\n    - `g=x³`: `(x³)²=x⁶ ∈ S`.\n    - `g=x⁴`: `(x⁴)²=x⁸=x ∈ S`.\n    - `g=x⁵`: `x*x⁵=x⁶ ∈ S`.\n    Thus, `S = {x, x⁶}` is a maximal product-free set. `C₇` is a solution.\n\n### Step 4: Summarize the results\n\nFurther analysis shows that for groups of order 8 or more, this property becomes exceedingly rare. For instance, in `Cₙ`, the set `{x, x⁻¹}` is a maximal product-free set only for `n=4, 5, 7` (among `n≥4`). For other groups like `D₅` or `Q₈`, any product-free set of size 2 can be shown to be a subset of a larger product-free set.\n\nThe exhaustive list of finite groups (up to isomorphism) that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 is:\n1.  `C₄` (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `V₄` (Klein four-group)\n3.  `C₅` (Cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  `S₃` (Symmetric/Dihedral group of order 6)\n5.  `C₇` (Cyclic group of order 7)\n\nThere are 5 such groups."
