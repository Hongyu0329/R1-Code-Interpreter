The final product is a tetracyclic ketone formed through a tandem anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement and a transannular Michael addition. The resulting structure contains a bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one core, which is further bridged by the cyclopentyl ring system connecting positions 2 and 5. The dimethoxy ketal and the tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy ether groups remain intact.
