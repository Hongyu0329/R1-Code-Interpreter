    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the probability of sampling a specific edge (the bottleneck edge) in a barbell graph during a single step of randomized uniform gossiping. To solve this, we need to precisely define the components involved:\n\n1.  **Barbell Graph with 10 nodes:** A barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge.\n    *   Since there are 10 nodes in total, the most standard and symmetric configuration is to have two complete graphs of 5 nodes each ($K_5$).\n    *   Let's call the two cliques Clique A and Clique B.\n    *   A single edge, known as the \"bridge\" or \"bottleneck edge\", connects one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B.\n\n2.  **Uniform Weights:** This implies all edges are treated equally. In probability calculations based on connectivity, we can consider all weights to be 1.\n\n3.  **Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** This describes the process of information dissemination. In a single step:\n    *   An active node `u` (one that has the information) is considered.\n    *   This node `u` chooses one of its neighbors, `v`, to pass the information to.\n    *   The choice is \"uniform\", meaning `u` selects any of its neighbors with equal probability. This probability is $1 / \\text{deg}(u)$, where $\\text{deg}(u)$ is the degree (number of neighbors) of node `u`.\n\n4.  **Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge:** This is the core question. It refers to the probability that in a single gossip step, the chosen edge for information transfer is the bottleneck edge. This requires two things to happen:\n    *   One of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge must be the active node.\n    *   That active node must choose its neighbor across the bridge.\n    *   We assume that any of the 10 nodes in the graph can be the initial active node with equal probability ($1/10$).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Graph Structure**\n\n*   **Nodes:** Total $N=10$ nodes.\n*   **Cliques:** Two complete graphs ($K_5$), let's call them Clique A and Clique B.\n*   **Nodes in Cliques:**\n    *   Clique A: $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\}$\n    *   Clique B: $\\{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5\\}$\n*   **Bottleneck Edge:** A single edge connects the two cliques. Let this edge connect node $a_1 \\in A$ and node $b_1 \\in B$. The nodes $a_1$ and $b_1$ are the \"bridgehead\" nodes.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Degree of Each Node**\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.\n\n*   **For non-bridgehead nodes:** Consider a node like $a_2$. It is in a $K_5$ clique, so it is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique ($a_1, a_3, a_4, a_5$). Its degree is 4. There are 4 such nodes in Clique A and 4 in Clique B, for a total of 8 nodes with degree 4.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(a_i) = 4$ for $i \\in \\{2,3,4,5\\}$\n    *   $\\text{deg}(b_j) = 4$ for $j \\in \\{2,3,4,5\\}$\n\n*   **For bridgehead nodes:** Consider node $a_1$. It is connected to the 4 other nodes in Clique A and also to node $b_1$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   $\\text{deg}(a_1) = (\\text{connections within } K_5) + (\\text{connection across bridge}) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   Similarly, for node $b_1$: $\\text{deg}(b_1) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Event of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n\nLet the bottleneck edge be $e = (a_1, b_1)$. This edge is \"sampled\" if information is passed along it. This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  Node $a_1$ is the active node and it passes the information to node $b_1$.\n2.  Node $b_1$ is the active node and it passes the information to node $a_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Each Event**\n\nWe assume any node can be the initial active node with a uniform probability of $1/N = 1/10$.\n\n*   **Case 1: Sampling from $a_1$ to $b_1$**\n    *   The probability that $a_1$ is the active node is $P(\\text{active} = a_1) = 1/10$.\n    *   If $a_1$ is active, it has 5 neighbors. The probability it chooses $b_1$ is $P(a_1 \\rightarrow b_1) = 1/\\text{deg}(a_1) = 1/5$.\n    *   The combined probability of this event is $P(\\text{active} = a_1) \\times P(a_1 \\rightarrow b_1) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Sampling from $b_1$ to $a_1$**\n    *   The probability that $b_1$ is the active node is $P(\\text{active} = b_1) = 1/10$.\n    *   If $b_1$ is active, it has 5 neighbors. The probability it chooses $a_1$ is $P(b_1 \\rightarrow a_1) = 1/\\text{deg}(b_1) = 1/5$.\n    *   The combined probability of this event is $P(\\text{active} = b_1) \\times P(b_1 \\rightarrow a_1) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Other Cases:** If any node other than $a_1$ or $b_1$ is the active node, it cannot sample the bottleneck edge in one step, because it is not connected to it. The probability in these cases is 0.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of the two disjoint cases where it can be sampled.\n\n$P(\\text{sample bottleneck edge}) = P(\\text{Case 1}) + P(\\text{Case 2})$\n$P(\\text{sample bottleneck edge}) = 1/50 + 1/50$\n$P(\\text{sample bottleneck edge}) = 2/50 = 1/25$\n\nConverting this to a decimal, $1/25 = 0.04$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Graph Structure:** The assumption that the 10-node barbell graph is formed by two 5-node cliques is critical. Any other partition (e.g., a 4-node and a 6-node clique) would change the degrees of the nodes and thus the final probability. The symmetric case is the standard interpretation.\n2.  **Gossiping Model:** The calculation relies on the \"push\" model of uniform gossiping where an active node chooses a neighbor.\n3.  **Starting Condition:** We assume a single gossip step starting from a uniformly random node. An alternative model could be analyzing the probability in a steady state (stationary distribution of a random walk), which would yield a different result ($1/21$). The phrasing of the question suggests a one-shot probability, making our chosen model more appropriate.\n4.  **Two Directions:** It's important to remember the bottleneck edge can be traversed in two directions ($a_1 \\to b_1$ and $b_1 \\to a_1$), and both possibilities must be included in the final probability.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe probability is the sum of probabilities of the two ways the edge can be chosen:\n(Prob. $a_1$ is chosen) * (Prob. $a_1$ picks $b_1$) + (Prob. $b_1$ is chosen) * (Prob. $b_1$ picks $a_1$)\n= (1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5)\n= 1/50 + 1/50\n= 2/50\n= 1/25\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
