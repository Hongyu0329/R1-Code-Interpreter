    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Curve and the Prime:**\n    The curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\n    We are interested in its stable reduction over the prime $p=2$. This means we need to find a model of the curve over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ whose special fiber (reduction modulo 2) is a stable curve, and then count the number of double points (nodes) on this stable fiber.\n\n2.  **Initial Reduction:**\n    Let's reduce the given equation modulo 2. The coefficients become:\n    $8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n    $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$\n    $4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n    So the reduced equation is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$.\n    This can be written as $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This represents a \"double line\" in the affine plane over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This is a highly singular, non-reduced scheme, and it is not a stable curve. This means the given model is not a \"good\" one for studying the reduction.\n\n3.  **Finding a Better Model:**\n    We need to find a new model of the curve, related to the original one by a change of variables over the field of 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, which has a better reduction. A standard technique is to use transformations of the form $x = 2^k X, y = 2^m Y$.\n    Let's try the transformation $(x, y) \\to (X/2, Y/2)$. This is an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n    Substitute $x=X/2$ and $y=Y/2$ into the original equation:\n    $(Y/2)^2 = 8(X/2) + (X/2)^2 + 4(X/2)^3 + 4(X/2)^4 + 8(X/2)^5$\n    $Y^2/4 = 4X + X^2/4 + 4X^3/8 + 4X^4/16 + 8X^5/32$\n    $Y^2/4 = 4X + X^2/4 + X^3/2 + X^4/4 + X^5/4$\n    To clear the denominators, we multiply the entire equation by 4:\n    $Y^2 = 16X + X^2 + 2X^3 + X^4 + X^5$\n    Let's call this new model $C'$. This is an integral model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reduction of the New Model:**\n    Let's reduce the equation of $C'$ modulo 2:\n    $Y^2 \\equiv 16X + X^2 + 2X^3 + X^4 + X^5 \\pmod 2$\n    $Y^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot X + X^2 + 0 \\cdot X^3 + X^4 + X^5 \\pmod 2$\n    $Y^2 \\equiv X^5 + X^4 + X^2$\n    We can factor the right-hand side:\n    $Y^2 \\equiv X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1)$\n    The polynomial $P(T) = T^3 + T^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (since $P(0)=1$ and $P(1)=1$).\n    The reduced curve $\\tilde{C'}$ is a union of two components over $\\mathbb{F}_2$:\n    a) The line $L$ given by $X=0$.\n    b) The curve $E$ given by $(Y/X)^2 = X^3+X^2+1$. This is a smooth elliptic curve, since $X^3+X^2+1$ has no repeated roots in characteristic 2.\n    The two components intersect where $X=0$. On $E$, if $X=0$, then $(Y/X)^2=1$, so $Y/X=1$. This corresponds to the point $(X,Y)=(0,0)$ on the affine plane. The tangent to $L$ is $X=0$. The tangent to $E$ at this point is also $X=0$. Thus, the line $L$ and the elliptic curve $E$ are tangent at the point $(0,0)$.\n    This configuration, a union of components with a point of tangency (a cusp), is not a stable curve. A stable curve can only have ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities.\n\n5.  **Finding the Stable Model and Counting Nodes:**\n    To get the stable model, we must resolve the tangency singularity. This is achieved by blowing up the singular point $(0,0)$ on the special fiber.\n    The blow-up process replaces the singular point with a projective line, called the exceptional divisor ($E_1$).\n    After one blow-up:\n    *   The proper transform of the line, $\\tilde{L}$, becomes disjoint from the proper transform of the elliptic curve, $\\tilde{E}$.\n    *   $\\tilde{L}$ intersects the exceptional divisor $E_1$ at a single point, forming a node.\n    *   $\\tilde{E}$ intersects the exceptional divisor $E_1$ at a different single point, forming another node.\n    The special fiber of this new model consists of three components: $\\tilde{L}$, $E_1$, and $\\tilde{E}$, connected in a chain-like structure: $\\tilde{L} - E_1 - \\tilde{E}$.\n\n6.  **Checking Stability:**\n    A curve is stable if every rational component ($\\mathbb{P}^1$) has at least 3 special points (nodes or marked points coming from the ramification points of the generic fiber).\n    *   The component $\\tilde{E}$ is an elliptic curve, so it's stable.\n    *   The component $\\tilde{L}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^1$. It has one node (its intersection with $E_1$). The ramification points of the original curve at $x=0$ and $x=\\infty$ specialize to this component, giving it two marked points. Total special points: $1+2=3$. So $\\tilde{L}$ is stable.\n    *   The component $E_1$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^1$. It has two nodes (its intersections with $\\tilde{L}$ and $\\tilde{E}$). We must check if any ramification point specializes to $E_1$. A ramification point specializes to the exceptional divisor if its reduction is the singular point that was blown up. Let's find the valuations of the roots of $F(X)=X^5+X^4+2X^3+X^2+16X$. The Newton polygon of $F(X)/X$ shows one root $r_1$ with $v_2(r_1)=4$. Since $v_2(r_1)>0$, its reduction is $X=0$. This ramification point specializes to the singular point $(0,0)$ and thus lands on the exceptional divisor $E_1$ after the blow-up. This gives $E_1$ a marked point. Total special points on $E_1$: $2+1=3$. So $E_1$ is stable.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The stable reduction consists of three components connected in a chain. The connections are ordinary double points (nodes). The configuration $\\tilde{L} - E_1 - \\tilde{E}$ has two points of intersection: one between $\\tilde{L}$ and $E_1$, and one between $E_1$ and $\\tilde{E}$.\n    Therefore, the stable reduction of the curve has exactly 2 double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
