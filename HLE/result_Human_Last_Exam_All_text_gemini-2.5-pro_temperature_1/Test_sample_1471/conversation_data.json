    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nThe problem requires us to solve the equation `XXIV / CCC - CXXVIII = ?`. The equation is written using Roman numerals, and the answer must be in modern (Arabic) numerals. We must follow the standard order of mathematical operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which dictates that division should be performed before subtraction.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Roman Numeral Conversion:** Accurately converting each Roman numeral to its Arabic numeral equivalent is the first and most critical step.\n    *   `I` = 1, `V` = 5, `X` = 10, `C` = 100.\n    *   Remember subtractive notation (e.g., `IV` = 4) and additive notation (e.g., `VI` = 6).\n2.  **Order of Operations:** The expression involves division and subtraction. Division must be performed first. The equation should be interpreted as `(XXIV / CCC) - CXXVIII`.\n3.  **Decimal Calculation:** The division part of the equation results in a decimal number, so care must be taken with the subsequent subtraction.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Convert Roman numerals to modern numbers.**\n    *   `XXIV`: `XX` represents 20 (10 + 10), and `IV` represents 4 (5 - 1). So, `XXIV` = 20 + 4 = **24**.\n    *   `CCC`: `C` represents 100. So, `CCC` = 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**.\n    *   `CXXVIII`: `C` represents 100, `XX` represents 20 (10 + 10), and `VIII` represents 8 (5 + 1 + 1 + 1). So, `CXXVIII` = 100 + 20 + 8 = **128**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Rewrite the equation using modern numbers.**\n    *   Substituting the converted values, the equation becomes: `24 / 300 - 128 = ?`\n\n*   **Step 3: Perform the division first, according to the order of operations.**\n    *   Calculate `24 / 300`.\n    *   `24 ÷ 300 = 0.08`\n\n*   **Step 4: Perform the subtraction.**\n    *   Now, substitute the result of the division back into the equation: `0.08 - 128`.\n    *   `0.08 - 128 = -127.92`\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is -127.92.\n\n<<<-127.92>>>"
