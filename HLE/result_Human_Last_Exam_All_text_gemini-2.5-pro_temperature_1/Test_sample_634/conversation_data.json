    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and definitions**\n\nWe are asked to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nA matrix R(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\nR(s) is a **common right divisor** of P1 and P2 if it is a right divisor of both.\nA common right divisor G(s) is a **GCRD** if any other common right divisor R(s) is a right divisor of G(s) (i.e., G(s) = L(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix L(s)). The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method**\n\nA standard method to find the GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) is to use the Euclidean algorithm by performing elementary row operations on the stacked matrix M(s) formed by P1(s) and P2(s).\n\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] =\n[\n  [s^2 + s, -s],\n  [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n  [s, 0],\n  [-s - 1, 1]\n]\n\nThe goal is to reduce this matrix to the form [G(s); 0] using elementary row operations, where G(s) is a square matrix. This G(s) will be a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s). The elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the row reduction**\n\nLet the rows be R1, R2, R3, R4.\nM(s) = [\n  R1: [s^2 + s, -s],\n  R2: [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n  R3: [s, 0],\n  R4: [-s - 1, 1]\n]\n\nThe polynomials in R3 and R4 have lower degrees, so we use them to simplify the other rows. Let's start by swapping rows to bring the simpler ones to the top.\nSwap R1 and R3:\n[\n  R1_new: [s, 0],\n  R2_new: [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n  R3_new: [s^2 + s, -s],\n  R4_new: [-s - 1, 1]\n]\n\nNow, use the new R1 to eliminate the first element in other rows.\n*   `R2 -> R2 + s * R1`: `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s*[s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]`\n*   `R3 -> R3 - (s+1) * R1`: `[s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)*[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s] = [0, -s]`\n*   `R4 -> R4 + 1 * R1`: `[-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-1, 1]`\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[\n  [s, 0],\n  [-1, s^2],\n  [0, -s],\n  [-1, 1]\n]\n\nNow we have a `1` (or `-1`) in the first column, which is excellent for further reduction. Let's swap R2 to the top and make its first element `1`.\nSwap R1 and R2:\n[\n  [-1, s^2],\n  [s, 0],\n  [0, -s],\n  [-1, 1]\n]\n\nMultiply R1 by -1:\n[\n  R1_new: [1, -s^2],\n  R2_new: [s, 0],\n  R3_new: [0, -s],\n  R4_new: [-1, 1]\n]\n\nUse the new R1 to eliminate the first element in other rows.\n*   `R2 -> R2 - s * R1`: `[s, 0] - s*[1, -s^2] = [s - s, 0 - s(-s^2)] = [0, s^3]`\n*   `R4 -> R4 + 1 * R1`: `[-1, 1] + [1, -s^2] = [-1 + 1, 1 - s^2] = [0, 1 - s^2]`\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[\n  [1, -s^2],\n  [0, s^3],\n  [0, -s],\n  [0, 1 - s^2]\n]\n\nThe first column is reduced. Now we focus on the second column for the rows with a `0` in the first column: `s^3`, `-s`, and `1 - s^2`. We want to find their greatest common divisor (GCD) using row operations.\nLet's bring a simpler polynomial row to the top of this sub-problem. Swap R2 and R3.\n[\n  [1, -s^2],\n  [0, -s],\n  [0, s^3],\n  [0, 1 - s^2]\n]\n\nLet R1', R2', R3', R4' be the current rows. Use R2' to simplify R3' and R4'.\n*   `R3' -> R3' + s^2 * R2'`: `[0, s^3] + s^2*[0, -s] = [0, s^3 - s^3] = [0, 0]`\n*   `R4' -> R4' - s * R2'`: `[0, 1 - s^2] - s*[0, -s] = [0, 1 - s^2 + s^2] = [0, 1]`\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[\n  [1, -s^2],\n  [0, -s],\n  [0, 0],\n  [0, 1]\n]\n\nWe have a row `[0, 1]`. This is very useful. Let's swap it up.\nSwap R2 and R4:\n[\n  [1, -s^2],\n  [0, 1],\n  [0, 0],\n  [0, -s]\n]\n\nNow, use the new R2 `[0, 1]` to eliminate the second element in other non-zero rows.\n*   `R1 -> R1 + s^2 * R2`: `[1, -s^2] + s^2*[0, 1] = [1, -s^2 + s^2] = [1, 0]`\n*   `R4 -> R4 + s * R2`: `[0, -s] + s*[0, 1] = [0, -s + s] = [0, 0]`\n\nThe final reduced matrix is:\n[\n  [1, 0],\n  [0, 1],\n  [0, 0],\n  [0, 0]\n]\n\nThe non-zero part of this matrix is the GCRD.\nG(s) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion and careful points**\n\n*   The process of row reduction on the stacked matrix [P1; P2] is a valid algorithm for finding the GCRD.\n*   The GCRD is the non-zero part of the final reduced matrix, which is the identity matrix I.\n*   When the GCRD is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the matrices P1 and P2 are said to be **right coprime**.\n*   We can verify this result by checking that the rank of the stacked matrix M(s) is 2 for all complex values of s.\n    *   `det(P2(s)) = det([[s, 0], [-s-1, 1]]) = s`. This is non-zero for all s ≠ 0, so the rank is 2 for s ≠ 0.\n    *   At s = 0, M(0) = [[0, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 0], [-1, 1]]. The submatrix formed by rows 2 and 4 has determinant -1 ≠ 0, so the rank is 2.\n    *   Since the rank is 2 for all s, the matrices are right coprime, and their GCRD is a unimodular matrix. The identity matrix is the canonical choice.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<%\n[[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n>>>"
