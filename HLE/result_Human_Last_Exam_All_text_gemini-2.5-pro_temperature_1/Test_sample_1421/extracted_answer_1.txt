The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int \mathcal{D}[\bar{\psi}] \mathcal{D}[\psi] \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$, where the functional integral is over all Grassmann fields $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$ that obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, i.e., $\psi(\tau=0) = -\psi(\tau=\beta)$. The term $S_E$ is the Euclidean action of the system, typically given by $S_E = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d\mathbf{x} \, \bar{\psi}(\partial_\tau + H)\psi$ for a Hamiltonian H.
