    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the value of `n` for which a \"tame functor\" `f: J -> Vect_K` is \"n-resolvable\", given that `J` is an \"upper semilattice\". We need to understand the precise meaning of these three key terms in the context of representation theory.\n\n2.  **Analyze \"Upper Semilattice (J)\":**\n    *   An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) `J` in which any two elements `x, y` have a least upper bound (supremum or join), denoted `x v y`.\n    *   This is a structural condition on the poset `J`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** If `J` is a finite poset, this condition implies that `J` has a unique maximal element (which is the join of all elements in `J`). A finite poset with a unique maximal element is often called a *cone*. This structure is particularly suited for certain reduction algorithms used in representation theory.\n\n3.  **Analyze \"Tame Functor (f)\":**\n    *   Tameness is a fundamental concept in representation theory that describes the complexity of classifying indecomposable representations.\n    *   A category of representations is **tame** if, for any given dimension `d`, the indecomposable representations of dimension `d` can be parameterized by a finite number of one-parameter families (plus a finite number of discrete indecomposables). This lies between *finite representation type* (only finitely many indecomposables in total) and *wild representation type* (classification is as hard as classifying pairs of matrices up to similarity, which is considered hopeless).\n    *   The term \"tame functor\" is not standard. Usually, tameness is a property of the entire category `Rep(J, K)`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The most reasonable interpretation is that \"a tame functor `f`\" refers to an indecomposable functor (or representation) `f` within a category `Rep(J, K)` that is of tame representation type. The category `Rep(J, K)` is tame if and only if the poset `J` does not contain any of a specific list of \"forbidden\" subposets (this is Nazarova's criterion).\n\n4.  **Analyze \"n-resolvable\":**\n    *   This term is also not standard in general homological algebra. We must consider its likely meaning in the specialized context of poset representations.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Homological Dimension.** One might guess that `n`-resolvable means the projective dimension `pd(f)` is at most `n`. However, this is incorrect. For example, consider the poset `J = {1 < 2 < 3}`. `J` is a chain, which is an upper semilattice. Its representation type is finite (type A_3), and therefore tame. However, the simple representation `S_1` (which is 1-dimensional at point 1 and 0 elsewhere) has a projective resolution `0 -> P_3 -> P_2 -> P_1 -> S_1 -> 0`, so `pd(S_1) = 2`. Thus, `pd(f) <= n` for a fixed `n=1` is not true for all tame cases.\n    *   **Possibility 2: A Technical Definition.** The terminology \"n-resolvable\" is specific to the work of the Kiev school of representation theory (A.V. Roiter, Y.A. Drozd, S.A. Kruglyak, etc.) on matrix problems. In this context, a representation problem is **1-resolvable** if any indecomposable representation is either from a finite list of base cases or can be obtained from an indecomposable representation of a strictly smaller dimension via a single application of a set of reduction functors (like the \"differentiation\" algorithms of Nazarova and Roiter).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This second interpretation is the correct one. The question is testing knowledge of a deep theorem in this area.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Find the Answer:**\n    *   The central result connecting these concepts is a theorem by Yuri Drozd, which was later refined for poset representations by others like S.A. Kruglyak. The theorem states that a representation problem (such as for a poset `J`) is of **tame type if and only if it is 1-resolvable**.\n    *   Therefore, if `f` is a \"tame functor\" (an indecomposable representation from a tame category `Rep(J,K)`), it belongs to a system that is, by definition and by theorem, 1-resolvable.\n    *   The condition that `J` is an upper semilattice provides a well-behaved structure for the reduction algorithms to work, but the core of the answer lies in the equivalence between tameness and 1-resolvability.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nA tame functor `f: J -> Vect_K` is part of a representation problem that is of tame type. According to a fundamental theorem by Drozd, a representation problem is tame if and only if it is 1-resolvable. Therefore, `n=1`.\n\n<<<1>>>"
