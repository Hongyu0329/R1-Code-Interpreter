    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the observer gain matrix.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time linear system:\n*   State equation: `x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n*   Output equation: `y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\n`B = [0; 1; -1; 1]`\n`C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\nThe goal is to design an observer of the form:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - Cx_hat(k))`\n\nThe design requirement is that the observation error, `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`, must become identically zero (`e(k) = 0`) in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as a **deadbeat observer**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Error Dynamics**\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error are given by:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to become zero in a finite number of steps, say `v`, and stay zero for any initial error `e(0)`, the error dynamics matrix `A_e = A - LC` must be nilpotent. This means `(A_e)^v = 0` for some integer `v`. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of `A_e` at the origin (`λ = 0`).\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_e` must be `det(zI - A_e) = z^n`, where `n` is the dimension of the state vector `x`. Here, `n = 4`, so we need the characteristic polynomial to be `z^4`.\n\n### **Step 3: Check Observability**\n\nA necessary condition for being able to place the observer poles (eigenvalues of `A_e`) arbitrarily is that the system `(A, C)` must be observable. We check this by computing the rank of the observability matrix `O`:\n`O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`\n\n*   `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n*   `CA = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n*   `CA^2 = [0 0 1 -2; 2 -1 0 -3]`\n\nLet's check the rank of the sub-matrix `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]`, which is a `6x4` matrix. We can find a `4x4` submatrix with a non-zero determinant. For example, using rows 1, 2, 4, and 6:\n`M = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0; 2 -1 0 -3]`\n`det(M) = 1 * det([0 0 1; 0 1 0; -1 0 -3]) = 1 * (1 * det([0 1; -1 0])) = 1 * (1 * (0 - (-1))) = 1 ≠ 0`.\nSince we found a full-rank `4x4` submatrix, the rank of `O` is 4. The system is observable.\n\nThe shortest possible time for the error to converge to zero is the system's observability index, `v_o`, which is the smallest integer `k` such that `rank([C; CA; ...; CA^(k-1)]) = n = 4`.\n*   `rank(C) = 2`\n*   `rank([C; CA]) = 3`\n*   `rank([C; CA; CA^2]) = 4`\nSo, the observability index is `v_o = 3`. This means the error can be made zero in 3 steps.\n\n### **Step 4: Use Duality for Pole Placement**\n\nFinding the observer gain `L` for `(A, C)` is the dual problem of finding the state-feedback controller gain `K` for the system `(A^T, C^T)`. The eigenvalues of `A - LC` are the same as the eigenvalues of its transpose, `(A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T L^T`.\n\nLet `L^T = K`. The problem becomes finding a `2x4` gain matrix `K` for the dual system `(A_c, B_c)` where `A_c = A^T` and `B_c = C^T`, such that the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A_c - B_c K` has all its eigenvalues at zero.\n\n*   `A_c = A^T = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n*   `B_c = C^T = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]`\n\n### **Step 5: Solve for the Gain Matrix K**\n\nThe problem has more degrees of freedom (8 elements in `K`) than constraints (4 coefficients in the characteristic polynomial). We can simplify the problem by making a choice for `K`. Let's assume the second row of `K` is all zeros:\n`K = [k_11 k_12 k_13 k_14; 0 0 0 0]`\n\nNow we compute `A_cl = A_c - B_c K`:\n`B_c K = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1] * [k_11 k_12 k_13 k_14; 0 0 0 0] = [k_11 k_12 k_13 k_14; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0]`\n`A_cl = A_c - B_c K = [-1-k_11  1-k_12  -k_13  -1-k_14; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is `det(zI - A_cl)`. After algebraic expansion, this polynomial is:\n`P(z) = z^4 + (2+k_11)z^3 + (3+k_11+k_14)z^2 + (-2+1+k_11+k_13)z + (-2(1+k_11)+k_12-1)`\n\nWe want `P(z) = z^4`, so all other coefficients must be zero:\n1.  `z^3` coeff: `2 + k_11 = 0`  =>  `k_11 = -2`\n2.  `z^2` coeff: `3 + k_11 + k_14 = 0`  =>  `3 - 2 + k_14 = 0`  =>  `k_14 = -1`\n3.  `z^1` coeff: `-1 + k_11 + k_13 = 0`  =>  `-1 - 2 + k_13 = 0`  =>  `k_13 = 3`\n4.  `z^0` coeff: `-2(1+k_11) + k_12 - 1 = 0`  =>  `-2(1-2) + k_12 - 1 = 0`  =>  `2 + k_12 - 1 = 0`  =>  `k_12 = -1`\n\nSo, the gain matrix `K` is:\n`K = [-2 -1 3 -1; 0 0 0 0]`\n\n### **Step 6: Determine the Observer Gain L**\n\nThe observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K`:\n`L = K^T`\n\n`L = [-2 0; -1 0; 3 0; -1 0]`\n\nThis is the gain matrix for the deadbeat observer.\n\n<<<[-2 0; -1 0; 3 0; -1 0]>>>"
