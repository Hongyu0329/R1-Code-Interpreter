    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point `(x, y, z)` that remains unchanged after the application of three functions F, G, and H in a specific manner. The conditions for the existence of such a point can be derived by extending the concepts of standard fixed-point theory, particularly the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, to a system of equations on a product space.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nFirst, we must clarify the problem statement. The functions are given as:\n*   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n*   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n*(Note: The original question listed two functions named `G`. We assume the second `G: Z*Y*X → Z` was a typo and should be `H: Z*Y*X → Z`, as this creates a coherent system for a \"tripled\" fixed point involving three distinct functions.)*\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Careful Point:** The order of arguments in each function is crucial. F takes `(x, y, z)`, G takes `(y, x, y)`, and H takes `(z, y, x)`. Our analysis must respect this specific structure.\n\n**Step 2: Reframe the Problem using an Operator on a Product Space**\n\nThe core idea is to treat the system of three equations as a single fixed-point equation in a larger space.\n\n1.  **Define the Product Space:** Let `W = X × Y × Z`. The elements of this space are the triplets `w = (x, y, z)`.\n2.  **Define a Metric on the Product Space:** For the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to apply, `W` must be a complete metric space. We assume `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces. We can then define a metric `d` on `W`, for instance, the sum metric:\n    `d((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    If X, Y, and Z are complete, then the product space `(W, d)` is also a complete metric space.\n3.  **Define the Combined Operator:** We define a single operator `T: W → W` as follows:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n    A fixed point of this operator `T` is a point `w = (x, y, z)` such that `T(w) = w`. This is equivalent to the system of equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that a contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point. Therefore, our problem reduces to finding conditions on F, G, and H that make the operator `T` a contraction mapping.\n\nA mapping `T` is a **contraction** if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w1, w2 ∈ W`, the following inequality holds:\n`d(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ k * d(w1, w2)`\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Contraction Conditions for F, G, and H**\n\nLet `w1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `w2 = (x2, y2, z2)`. We need to expand `d(T(w1), T(w2))` and find conditions that bound it.\n\n`d(T(w1), T(w2)) = d( (F(x1,y1,z1), G(y1,x1,y1), H(z1,y1,x1)), (F(x2,y2,z2), G(y2,x2,y2), H(z2,y2,x2)) )`\n\nUsing our sum metric, this becomes:\n`= d_X(F(x1,y1,z1), F(x2,y2,z2)) + d_Y(G(y1,x1,y1), G(y2,x2,y2)) + d_Z(H(z1,y1,x1), H(z2,y2,x2))`\n\nTo make this a contraction, we assume F, G, and H are Lipschitz continuous in their respective arguments.\n\n*   **For F:** There exist non-negative constants `a1, a2, a3` such that:\n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1, x2) + a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + a3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   **For G:** There exist non-negative constants `b1, b2` such that:\n    `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2)`\n*   **For H:** There exist non-negative constants `c1, c2, c3` such that:\n    `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c1*d_Z(z1, z2) + c2*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n\nNow, we sum these inequalities:\n`d(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ (a1 d_X + a2 d_Y + a3 d_Z) + (b1 d_Y + b2 d_X) + (c1 d_Z + c2 d_Y + c3 d_X)`\n\nGroup the terms by `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n`d(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ (a1 + b2 + c3)d_X(x1, x2) + (a2 + b1 + c2)d_Y(y1, y2) + (a3 + c1)d_Z(z1, z2)`\n\nLet `k = max(a1 + b2 + c3, a2 + b1 + c2, a3 + c1)`. Then we can write:\n`d(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ k * d_X(x1, x2) + k * d_Y(y1, y2) + k * d_Z(z1, z2)`\n`d(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n`d(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ k * d(w1, w2)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we must have `k < 1`.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\nBased on the analysis, the following conditions are sufficient to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n1.  **Space Condition:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty **complete metric spaces** with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`, respectively.\n\n2.  **Function Condition (Lipschitz-type):** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy certain continuity conditions. Specifically, there must exist non-negative constants `a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, c1, c2, c3` such that for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1, z2 ∈ Z`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1, x2) + a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + a3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c1*d_Z(z1, z2) + c2*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n3.  **Contraction Condition:** The sum of the relevant constants must be less than 1. Specifically:\n    `max(a1 + b2 + c3, a2 + b1 + c2, a3 + c1) < 1`\n\nIf these three conditions hold, the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem ensures that the operator `T` has a unique fixed point, which corresponds to a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` for the system `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, `H(z,y,x)=z` exists and is unique if the following conditions are met:\n1.  `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are non-empty complete metric spaces.\n2.  There exist non-negative constants `a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, c1, c2, c3` such that for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, `z1, z2 ∈ Z`, the functions satisfy the following inequalities:\n    *   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ a1*d_X(x1, x2) + a2*d_Y(y1, y2) + a3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ b1*d_Y(y1, y2) + b2*d_X(x1, x2)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ c1*d_Z(z1, z2) + c2*d_Y(y1, y2) + c3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n3.  The constants satisfy the overall contraction condition: `max(a1 + b2 + c3, a2 + b1 + c2, a3 + c1) < 1`.>>>"
