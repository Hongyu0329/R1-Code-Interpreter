    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the kanji character 謄.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Character:** The character provided is 謄.\n2.  **Deconstruct the Character:** We need to break down the character into its constituent parts to identify the radical (bushu). The character 謄 is composed of a left part and a right part.\n    *   The left part is: 言\n    *   The right part is: 滕\n3.  **Identify the Radical:** In kanji with a left-right structure (hen-tsukuri), the left part is very often the radical that classifies the character. The component 言 is a common radical. This radical is associated with concepts like \"speech,\" \"words,\" and \"language,\" which aligns with the meaning of 謄 (to copy, transcribe). Therefore, 言 is the radical of 謄.\n4.  **Find the Japanese Name of the Radical:** Radicals in Japanese have specific names, which often depend on their position within the character. When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is known as a \"hen\" (偏). The specific name for this radical is **ごんべん (gonben)**. This name is formed from \"gon\" (the on'yomi or Sino-Japanese reading of 言) and \"hen\" (which is voiced to \"ben\" in this combination).\n5.  **Provide the Hepburn Transcription:** The final step is to write the Japanese name of the radical using Hepburn romanization, as requested by the example (\"Onnahen\"). The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is **Gonben**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Correct Character Recognition:** It is essential to analyze the correct character, 謄. It should not be confused with similar characters like 騰 (which has the radical 馬, umahen) or 藤 (which has the radical 艹, kusakanmuri).\n*   **Positional Naming:** Be aware that radical names can change based on their position. While 言 itself can be read as \"kotoba,\" its name as a left-side radical is specifically \"gonben.\"\n*   **Voicing:** Note the sound change from \"hen\" to \"ben\" (rendaku) in the name \"gonben.\" This is a common phonetic phenomenon in Japanese.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the final answer is the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
