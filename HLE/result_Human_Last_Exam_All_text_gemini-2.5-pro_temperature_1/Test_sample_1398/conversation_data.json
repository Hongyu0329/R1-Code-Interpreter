    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the grid transformation logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** The core task is to identify the rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid. The transformation is applied to each cell of the grid, and the new value of a cell likely depends on its current value and the values of its neighboring cells. The grids are 5x5 and contain binary values (0 or 1).\n\n2.  **Hypothesize the Rule:** A common type of transformation for such problems is a cellular automaton, like Conway's Game of Life. In these systems, the next state of a cell (live or dead) is determined by the number of live neighbors it has. Let's assume the neighborhood of a cell consists of its 8 adjacent cells (Moore neighborhood).\n\n3.  **Test and Refine the Hypothesis:** Let's denote `S8` as the sum of the values of the 8 neighbors of a cell.\n    *   **If the cell is 0 (dead):**\n        *   In Example 1, cell (0,0) is 0. Its neighbors are (0,1)=1, (1,0)=1, (1,1)=0. So, `S8 = 2`. The output is 1. This suggests a \"birth\" condition.\n        *   In Example 1, cell (1,1) is 0. Its neighbors are (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=0, (1,0)=1, (1,2)=0, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1. So, `S8 = 3`. The output is 1. This also suggests a birth condition.\n        *   In Example 3, cell (0,0) is 0. Its neighbor is (1,0)=1. So, `S8 = 1`. The output is 0. The cell stays dead.\n        *   In Example 2, cell (1,1) is 0. Its neighbors sum to `S8 = 4`. The output is 0. The cell stays dead.\n        *   **Conclusion for dead cells:** A dead cell (0) becomes live (1) if it has exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors. Otherwise, it remains dead. This is the B23 rule (Born if 2 or 3 neighbors).\n\n    *   **If the cell is 1 (live):**\n        *   In Example 1, cell (0,1) is 1. Its neighbors sum to `S8 = 1`. The output is 0. This is \"death by underpopulation\".\n        *   In Example 1, cell (1,3) is 1. Its neighbors sum to `S8 = 2`. The output is 1. This is \"survival\".\n        *   In Example 2, cell (1,2) is 1. Its neighbors sum to `S8 = 4`. The output is 1. This is also \"survival\".\n        *   Let's check for overpopulation. In Example 4, cell (2,2) is 1. Its neighbors are all 0s and 1s, summing to `S8 = 8`. The output is 0, which is \"death by overpopulation\".\n        *   **Conclusion for live cells:** A live cell (1) survives (stays 1) if it has 2, 3, or 4 live neighbors. Otherwise, it dies (becomes 0). This is the S234 rule (Survive if 2, 3, or 4 neighbors).\n\n4.  **Final Rule:** The transformation rule, a cellular automaton variant, is as follows:\n    *   A cell's next state is determined by its current state and the number of its 8 live neighbors (`S8`).\n    *   **Birth:** A dead cell (value 0) with `S8 = 2` or `S8 = 3` becomes a live cell (value 1).\n    *   **Survival:** A live cell (value 1) with `S8 = 2`, `S8 = 3`, or `S8 = 4` stays a live cell (value 1).\n    *   **Death:** In all other cases, the cell becomes or stays dead (value 0).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nNow, we apply this rule to the test input grid, cell by cell.\n\n**Test Input Grid 6:**\n```\n[0 1 1 0 0]\n[1 0 0 1 0]\n[1 0 1 0 1]\n[0 1 0 0 1]\n[1 0 1 1 0]\n```\n\n**Calculations:**\n*   **Row 0:**\n    *   (0,0): In=0, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Birth)\n    *   (0,1): In=1, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   (0,2): In=1, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   (0,3): In=0, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Birth)\n    *   (0,4): In=0, S8=1 -> Out=0 (Stays dead)\n    *   **Output Row 0: [1 1 1 1 0]**\n\n*   **Row 1:**\n    *   (1,0): In=1, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   (1,1): In=0, S8=5 -> Out=0 (Stays dead)\n    *   (1,2): In=0, S8=4 -> Out=0 (Stays dead)\n    *   (1,3): In=1, S8=3 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   (1,4): In=0, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Birth)\n    *   **Output Row 1: [1 0 0 1 1]**\n\n*   **Row 2:**\n    *   (2,0): In=1, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   (2,1): In=0, S8=4 -> Out=0 (Stays dead)\n    *   (2,2): In=1, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   (2,3): In=0, S8=4 -> Out=0 (Stays dead)\n    *   (2,4): In=1, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   **Output Row 2: [1 0 1 0 1]**\n\n*   **Row 3:**\n    *   (3,0): In=0, S8=3 -> Out=1 (Birth)\n    *   (3,1): In=1, S8=4 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   (3,2): In=0, S8=4 -> Out=0 (Stays dead)\n    *   (3,3): In=0, S8=5 -> Out=0 (Stays dead)\n    *   (3,4): In=1, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   **Output Row 3: [1 1 0 0 1]**\n\n*   **Row 4:**\n    *   (4,0): In=1, S8=1 -> Out=0 (Death)\n    *   (4,1): In=0, S8=3 -> Out=1 (Birth)\n    *   (4,2): In=1, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   (4,3): In=1, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Survival)\n    *   (4,4): In=0, S8=2 -> Out=1 (Birth)\n    *   **Output Row 4: [0 1 1 1 1]**\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n```\n[1 1 1 1 0]\n[1 0 0 1 1]\n[1 0 1 0 1]\n[1 1 0 0 1]\n[0 1 1 1 1]\n```\n\n**Final Answer String:**\nConcatenating the rows gives the final 25-character binary string.\n1111010011101011100101111\n\n<<<1111010011101011100101111>>>"
