    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Who:** We are looking for a specific individual, a \"Christian theologian.\"\n2.  **What:** This theologian \"developed specialized terminology.\" This implies a specific, defined vocabulary or conceptual framework, not just a general belief in miracles.\n3.  **Purpose:** The terminology is used \"to describe changes in the laws of nature.\"\n4.  **Application:** This framework must be applicable to two specific theological events:\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus.\n    *   Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall of Man.\n5.  **Chronology:** The question asks who did this \"first.\" This directs us to look at earlier figures in Christian history rather than later ones.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates and Their Concepts**\nWe need to consider major theologians known for integrating philosophy with theology, particularly concerning creation, miracles, and providence.\n\n*   **Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130 – c. 202 AD):** A key early figure, but his focus was on \"recapitulation\" and combating Gnosticism. He affirmed these miracles but did not develop a specific philosophical terminology for the mechanics of natural law.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 AD):** A very strong candidate. He wrote extensively on creation, God's providence, and miracles in works like *The City of God* and *On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis*. He developed a key concept to explain unusual events.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** Augustine proposed the idea of **\"seminal reasons\"** (*rationes seminales* or *causales*). He argued that God, at the initial creation, embedded all the future potentialities of the world within it, like seeds. The normal course of nature is the unfolding of the most common of these seeds.\n    *   **Miracles and Natural Law:** A miracle, for Augustine, is not something \"contrary to nature,\" because nothing can be contrary to the will of the Creator who defines nature. Instead, a miracle is an event that is \"contrary to the *known* course of nature.\" It is the activation by God of a seminal reason that was latent and not part of the ordinary, observable process.\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth is not a violation of nature, but the unfolding of a unique potentiality that God placed within creation from the beginning, to be actualized at the right time.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** The changes after the Fall (e.g., mortality, toil, pain in childbirth) can be understood within this framework as the emergence of negative potentialities that were previously held in check by a supernatural gift of grace.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274 AD):** Another very strong candidate, but he lived much later than Augustine.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** Aquinas, drawing on Aristotle, distinguished between God's **\"ordained power\"** (*potentia Dei ordinata*) and God's **\"absolute power\"** (*potentia Dei absoluta*). The ordained power refers to God's decision to work through the consistent, established laws of nature. The absolute power refers to God's ability to do anything that is not a logical contradiction, including acting outside the ordained system.\n    *   **Application:** This framework clearly explains the virgin birth as an act of God's absolute power, while the Fall represents a shift in the ordained order.\n*   **Reformation and Modern Theologians (e.g., Calvin, C.S. Lewis):** While they wrote about these topics, they were generally building on or reacting to the foundations laid by earlier thinkers like Augustine and Aquinas, and are less likely to be the *first* to develop such terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Compare Candidates and Conclude**\nBoth Augustine and Aquinas provide specialized terminology to address the question. However, the question asks who was the **first**. Augustine of Hippo lived over 800 years before Thomas Aquinas. His doctrine of *rationes seminales* is a sophisticated and original framework developed in the early Church to explain precisely how God can act in extraordinary ways (like the virgin birth) that seem to alter the course of nature, while also accounting for shifts in the state of creation (like at the Fall). Therefore, he is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer Analysis:**\n*   **Theologian:** Augustine of Hippo.\n*   **First:** Yes, he predates other key systematic thinkers.\n*   **Specialized Terminology:** *Rationes seminales* (seminal reasons).\n*   **Application to Changes in Natural Law:** Explains miracles not as violations of nature, but as activations of latent, divinely-implanted potentials.\n*   **Application to Virgin Birth and the Fall:** The framework is explicitly used by Augustine to understand both these events.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
