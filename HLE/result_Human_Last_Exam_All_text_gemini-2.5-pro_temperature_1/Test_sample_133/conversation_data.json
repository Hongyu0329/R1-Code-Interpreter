    "An analysis of the Connect 4 board position.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find all the optimal moves for player 'O' to win as fast as possible. This means we first look for a move that wins immediately. If no such move exists, we look for a move that guarantees a win on 'O's next turn (a forced win).\n\n**2. Current Board State**\nLet's represent the board with columns 'a' through 'g' and rows 1 (top) through 6 (bottom).\n\n```\n  a b c d e f g\n1 . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . .\n3 . . . . . . .\n4 . . . O O . .\n5 O . X O X X X\n6 X O O X X O X\n```\nIt is 'O's turn to move.\n\n**3. Check for Immediate Winning Moves (Win in 1)**\nAn immediate win is a move that completes a line of four 'O's (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Let's examine all legal moves for 'O' (the lowest empty space in each column).\n\n*   **a4**: Does not complete any line of four.\n*   **b4**: Does not complete any line of four.\n*   **c4**: Does not complete any line of four.\n*   **d3**: Does not complete any line of four. (The vertical line `d3-d4-d5-d6` is blocked by 'X' at d6).\n*   **e3**: Does not complete any line of four.\n*   **f4**: Does not complete any line of four.\n*   **g4**: Does not complete any line of four.\n\nThere are no moves that allow 'O' to win immediately.\n\n**4. Check for Forced Wins (Win in 3-ply: O moves, X blocks, O wins)**\nA forced win is typically created by making a move that creates two separate winning threats at the same time. The opponent can only block one, allowing you to win on the other on your next turn.\n\nLet's re-examine the legal moves to see if any create a double threat. The most likely place to create such a threat is on row 4, where 'O' already has two adjacent pieces at `d4` and `e4`.\n\n*   **Move c4:**\n    *   'O' places a piece at `c4`.\n    *   This creates a horizontal line of three 'O's: `c4-d4-e4`.\n    *   This line has two open ends: `b4` and `f4`.\n    *   **Threat 1:** 'O' threatens to play at `b4` on the next turn to win with the line `b4-c4-d4-e4`.\n    *   **Threat 2:** 'O' threatens to play at `f4` on the next turn to win with the line `c4-d4-e4-f4`.\n    *   Since 'X' can only place one piece and block one of these threats (either at `b4` or `f4`), 'O' is guaranteed to win by playing in the other unblocked spot on the next turn.\n    *   Therefore, **c4 is an optimal move.**\n\n*   **Move f4:**\n    *   'O' places a piece at `f4`.\n    *   This creates a horizontal line of three 'O's: `d4-e4-f4`.\n    *   This line has two open ends: `c4` and `g4`.\n    *   **Threat 1:** 'O' threatens to play at `c4` on the next turn to win with the line `c4-d4-e4-f4`.\n    *   **Threat 2:** 'O' threatens to play at `g4` on the next turn to win with the line `d4-e4-f4-g4`.\n    *   Just like the previous case, 'X' can only block one of these threats. 'O' is guaranteed to win on the next turn.\n    *   Therefore, **f4 is also an optimal move.**\n\n*   **Other Moves:**\n    *   Moves like `b4` or `g4` would create only a single threat (e.g., playing `g4` creates the `d4-e4-g4` group, threatening `f4`), which 'X' can easily block on their turn. They do not force a win.\n    *   Moves `a4`, `d3`, and `e3` do not create any immediate winning threats for 'O'.\n\n**5. Defensive Check**\nWe must ensure 'X' doesn't have an immediate threat that 'O' must block.\n*   'X' has three pieces in a row horizontally at `e5-f5-g5`. However, the winning spot `d5` is already taken by 'O'.\n*   'X' has no other three-in-a-row formations that pose an immediate threat.\n'O' is therefore free to execute its winning plan without needing to play defensively.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThere are no immediate winning moves. However, two moves, `c4` and `f4`, each create a double threat that forces a win for 'O' on the following turn. As they both lead to a win in the same number of moves, they are both considered optimal.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
