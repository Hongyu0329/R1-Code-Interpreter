    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number `n` such that a set `G` with `n` elements and a binary operation `·` does not form a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Group\n\nA group is a pair `(G, ·)`, where `G` is a set and `·` is a binary operation on `G`. For `(G, ·)` to be a group, it must satisfy four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result of the operation, `a · b`, is also in `G`. The phrase \"binary operation on G\" in the question implies that this condition is met by definition.\n2.  **Associativity:** For any three elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` must hold.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There must exist an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there must exist an element `b` in `G` (the inverse of `a`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size `n` of the set `G` for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that at least one of the last three axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) is violated.\n\n**Careful Point:** Standard definitions of a group require the set `G` to be non-empty. Therefore, we will only consider `n ≥ 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Case n = 1\n\nLet `G` be a set with one element, say `G = {a}`.\n*   **Binary Operation:** There is only one possible binary operation we can define on `G`. For the closure property to hold, the result of `a · a` must be an element of `G`. Since `a` is the only element, we must have `a · a = a`.\n*   **Check the Group Axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** `a · a = a`, and `a` is in `G`. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`. Also, `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. So, `(a · a) · a = a · (a · a)`. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The element `a` acts as the identity element because `a · a = a`. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For the element `a`, its inverse must be an element `x` such that `a · x = a` (the identity). We can choose `x = a`, since `a · a = a`. This is satisfied.\n\nSince all four axioms are satisfied, any set of size 1 with a binary operation is always a group (known as the trivial group). Therefore, `n` cannot be 1.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Case n = 2\n\nLet `G` be a set with two elements, say `G = {a, b}`. We need to determine if we can define a binary operation `·` on `G` that fails to satisfy at least one of the group axioms. We only need to find one such operation.\n\nLet's try to construct an operation that violates the **Identity Element** axiom. To do this, we need to ensure that no element in `G` behaves like an identity element.\n\nConsider the following operation defined by the Cayley table:\n```\n  · | a   b\n ---|-------\n  a | a   a\n  b | b   b\n```\n*   **Check the Group Axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** All entries in the table (`a` and `b`) are elements of `G`. The operation is closed.\n    *   **Identity Element:** Let's check if either `a` or `b` can be the identity element `e`.\n        *   Test `a`: For `a` to be the identity, we need `a · x = x` and `x · a = x` for all `x` in `G`. Let's check `x = b`. We have `a · b = a`. This is not equal to `b`. So, `a` is not the identity element.\n        *   Test `b`: For `b` to be the identity, we need `b · x = x` and `x · a = x` for all `x` in `G`. Let's check `x = a`. We have `b · a = b`. This is not equal to `a`. So, `b` is not the identity element.\n    *   Since neither `a` nor `b` is an identity element, this structure `(G, ·)` has no identity element.\n\nBecause the Identity Element axiom is violated, `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n*   For `n = 1`, any set with a binary operation must be a group.\n*   For `n = 2`, we were able to construct a set with a binary operation that is *not* a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number `n` for which such a set and operation exist is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
