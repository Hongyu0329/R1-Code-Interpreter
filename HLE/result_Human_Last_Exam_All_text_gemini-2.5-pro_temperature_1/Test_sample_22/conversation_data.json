    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** SNP heritability is a population parameter that quantifies the proportion of the variation in a phenotype (a trait like height or disease risk) that can be explained by the additive effects of all measured or imputed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It represents the *theoretical upper limit* or the *ceiling* of how much phenotypic variance could possibly be predicted using a linear model of all SNPs, assuming their true effects were perfectly known.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:** A polygenic score is a practical tool, not a theoretical limit. It is a single value calculated for an individual by summing up their genotypes at many SNPs, with each SNP's contribution weighted by its estimated effect size. These effect sizes are *estimated* from a specific Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how well it correlates with the actual phenotype in an independent group of people. This is typically quantified by R-squared (R²), which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS.\n\n3.  **Compare the Foundation of Both Measures:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** Based on the *true*, unknown effect sizes of all SNPs. It represents the total available genetic \"signal.\"\n    *   **PGS Predictive Ability (R²):** Based on *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS of a finite sample size. These estimates are inherently noisy and imperfect.\n\n4.  **Identify Why PGS Predictive Ability is Lower than SNP Heritability:** The process of creating and applying a PGS introduces several limitations that prevent its predictive ability (R²) from reaching the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP).\n    *   **Estimation Error:** GWASs are conducted on finite samples of people. This means the effect size estimated for each SNP is not its true value but an estimate with a margin of error. When these noisy estimates are combined to create a PGS, the overall predictive power is diminished. The smaller the GWAS sample, the noisier the estimates, and the lower the PGS accuracy.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** SNPs are often correlated with each other. This makes it difficult for a GWAS to pinpoint the truly causal SNP, so the estimated effect for one SNP might actually reflect the effects of its neighbors. Methods to build PGSs try to account for this, but these methods are imperfect, leading to a loss of predictive power.\n    *   **Incomplete Information:** Not all causal variants may be included on the SNP chips used for genotyping or be well-imputed. The PGS can only use the information available to it.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the total variance that is *potentially* explainable by SNPs. The predictive ability of a PGS (R²) represents the variance that is *actually* explained by a real-world model built from imperfect data. Because the model is built with imperfect information (noisy effect estimates, imperfect handling of LD, etc.), its performance will inevitably be lower than the theoretical maximum. The R² of a PGS can get closer to the h²_SNP as the GWAS sample size increases towards infinity, but it can never exceed it and, in practice, will always be lower.\n\nTherefore, the statement is correct.\n\n<<<True>>>"
