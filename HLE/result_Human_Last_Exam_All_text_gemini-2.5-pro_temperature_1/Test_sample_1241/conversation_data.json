    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the steady-state value of the sum of probabilities $P_0(t)$ and $P_1(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. We need to calculate $p_0 + p_1$.\n\n2.  **Identify the System of Equations:** The problem provides a system of linear ordinary differential equations (the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations) for the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of a system being in one of four states (0, 1, 2, 3).\n    $$\n    P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t) \\\\\n    P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) \\\\\n    P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t) \\\\\n    P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) \\\\\n    P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n    $$\n\n3.  **Careful Point: Check for Consistency:** A critical step is to verify the consistency of the given equations. For a closed system where the total probability is conserved (i.e., $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$), the sum of the derivatives must be zero: $\\sum P_i'(t) = 0$.\n    Let's sum the given differential equations:\n    $\\sum P_i'(t) = (-\\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1) + (-\\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\dots) + (\\lambda_{12}P_1 - \\dots) + (\\lambda_{23}P_2 - \\dots)$\n    Collecting terms for each $P_i(t)$:\n    - For $P_0(t)$: $-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01} = -2\\lambda_{01}$\n    - For $P_1(t)$: $\\lambda_{10} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + \\lambda_{12} = 0$\n    - For $P_2(t)$: $\\lambda_{21} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}) + \\lambda_{23} = 0$\n    - For $P_3(t)$: $\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31} = 0$\n    The sum is $\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\n    This contradicts the condition $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$, which implies its derivative is zero. The only way for the equations to be consistent is if $P_0(t)=0$, which is not generally true.\n    This indicates a typo in the second equation. In a standard Markov process, the term representing flow from state 0 to state 1, which is $\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$, should be positive in the equation for $P_1'(t)$.\n    **Corrected Equation:** We assume the second equation should be:\n    $$ P_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\n    With this correction, $\\sum P_i'(t) = 0$, which is consistent with the conservation of probability.\n\n4.  **Set up the Steady-State Equations:** In the steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities are constant, so their derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(+\\infty) = 0$. The system becomes a set of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $p_i$:\n    (I)   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    (II)  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    (III) $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n    (IV)  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    (V)   $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:** We express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$ using equations (I), (III), and (IV).\n    - From (I): $\\lambda_{01}p_{0} = \\lambda_{10}p_{1} \\implies p_{0} = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}p_{1}$\n    - From (III): $(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2} = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} \\implies p_{2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}}p_{1}$\n    - From (IV): $\\lambda_{31}p_{3} = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} \\implies p_{3} = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}}p_{2}$\n\n6.  **Substitute Numerical Values:** Now, substitute the given values of $\\lambda_{ij}$:\n    $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n    - $p_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}p_{1}$\n    - $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$.\n    - $p_{2} = \\frac{0.4}{0.4}p_{1} = p_{1}$\n    - $p_{3} = \\frac{0.008}{0.008}p_{2} = p_{2} = p_{1}$\n\n7.  **Use the Normalization Condition:** Substitute these expressions into equation (V):\n    $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n    $\\frac{0.65}{0.019}p_{1} + p_{1} + p_{1} + p_{1} = 1$\n    $p_{1} \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$\n    $p_{1} \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n    $p_{1} \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n    $p_{1} \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1 \\implies p_{1} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** We need to find $p_0 + p_1$.\n    First, find $p_0$:\n    $p_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}p_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n    Now, sum $p_0$ and $p_1$:\n    $p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n    Finally, we perform the division:\n    $p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to six decimal places, the result is 0.946252."
