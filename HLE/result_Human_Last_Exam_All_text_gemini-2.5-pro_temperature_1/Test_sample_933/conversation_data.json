    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Synthesis Reaction**\nXenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is synthesized by the direct chemical reaction between xenon (Xe) gas and fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\nXe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Conditions for Synthesis**\nThe outcome of the reaction between xenon and fluorine (i.e., whether XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆ is formed) is highly dependent on the reaction conditions: temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants.\n\n*   **To produce XeF₄ specifically and efficiently:** The established laboratory and industrial method requires heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a specific ratio (typically 1 part Xe to 5 parts F₂, an excess of fluorine) in a sealed vessel (usually made of nickel or Monel).\n\n**Step 3: The Role of Temperature in the Reaction**\nTemperature plays a crucial role in this synthesis for two main reasons:\n\n1.  **Activation Energy:** The reaction has a significant activation energy. A sufficiently high temperature is required to provide the energy needed to break the bonds in the F₂ molecules and initiate the reaction at a practical rate. If the temperature is too low, the reaction will be extremely slow, making the process inefficient.\n2.  **Chemical Equilibrium:** The synthesis of XeF₄ is an exothermic reaction (it releases heat). According to Le Chatelier's principle, if the temperature is too high, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the decomposition of XeF₄ back into Xe and F₂. This would decrease the overall yield and make the process inefficient. Additionally, very high temperatures can promote the formation of XeF₆.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Optimal Temperature for \"Efficient\" Production**\nAn \"efficient\" process is one that provides a good yield in a reasonable amount of time. For the synthesis of XeF₄, a specific temperature balances the need for a fast reaction rate with the need to prevent product decomposition.\n\n*   Reviewing chemical literature, the standard, well-established temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄ is approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a good pace and the yield of XeF₄ is high.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is too high. While the reaction would be fast, the equilibrium would shift towards decomposition, and the formation of XeF₆ would become more likely, reducing the efficiency of XeF₄ production.\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the textbook temperature for efficient synthesis of XeF₄. It provides the best balance between reaction rate and yield.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be significantly slower. The process would not be considered \"efficient\" because it would take a very long time to produce a meaningful amount of product.\n*   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to overcome the activation energy for the thermal reaction. At these temperatures, the reaction rate is practically zero, and no significant amount of XeF₄ would be produced. While other methods like photochemical synthesis can occur at lower temperatures, the direct thermal method is the most common for \"efficient\" production, and it requires high heat.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, 400 °C is the lowest temperature among the choices at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently using the standard synthesis method. Any colder, and the process becomes impractically slow.\n\n<<<B>>>"
