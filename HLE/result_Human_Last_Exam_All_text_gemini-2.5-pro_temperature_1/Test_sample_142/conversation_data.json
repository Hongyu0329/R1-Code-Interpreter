    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for the requested calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons ($N_{elec}$)**\n\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ and sum their electrons. The molecule consists of one Carbon (C), three Hydrogen (H), one Silicon (Si), and one Fluorine (F) atom.\n\n*   Electrons from Carbon (C, atomic number 6) = 6\n*   Electrons from three Hydrogens (H, atomic number 1) = 3 * 1 = 3\n*   Electrons from Silicon (Si, atomic number 14) = 14\n*   Electrons from Fluorine (F, atomic number 9) = 9\n\nTotal number of electrons, $N_{elec}$ = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of spatial orbitals ($N_{orb}$)**\n\nThe number of spatial orbitals in the calculation is equal to the total number of basis functions in the specified basis set, 6-31G**. We need to count the number of basis functions for each atom.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part describes the 1s orbital with two basis functions (a split valence).\n    *   The second `*` (or `p` in (d,p)) adds a set of three p-type polarization functions (px, py, pz).\n    *   Total for one H atom = 2 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 5 basis functions.\n\n*   **For Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row atoms):**\n    *   The 6-31G part describes the core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) orbitals. This results in 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 basis functions.\n    *   The first `*` (or `d` in (d,p)) adds a set of five d-type polarization functions.\n    *   Total for one C or F atom = 9 + 5 = 14 basis functions.\n\n*   **For Silicon (Si) (3rd-row atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G part describes the core (1s, 2s, 2p) and valence (3s, 3p) orbitals. This results in 5 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 13 basis functions.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of five d-type polarization functions.\n    *   Total for one Si atom = 13 + 5 = 18 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$:\n$N_{orb}$ = (1 * C) + (3 * H) + (1 * Si) + (1 * F)\n$N_{orb}$ = (1 * 14) + (3 * 5) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 14)\n$N_{orb}$ = 14 + 15 + 18 + 14 = 61.\n\nSo, we have $K = N_{orb} = 61$ spatial orbitals.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of CSFs**\n\nA full CI calculation for a stable, even-electron molecule like this typically refers to the singlet ground state (Total Spin, S=0). The number of CSFs for N electrons in K orbitals with a total spin S is given by the formula:\n\n$N_{CSF}(K, N, S) = \\binom{K}{N/2+S}\\binom{K}{N/2-S} - \\binom{K}{N/2+S+1}\\binom{K}{N/2-S-1}$\n\nFor our case:\n*   $K = 61$ (orbitals)\n*   $N = 32$ (electrons)\n*   $S = 0$ (singlet state)\n*   $N/2 = 16$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{61}{16+0}\\binom{61}{16-0} - \\binom{61}{16+1}\\binom{61}{16-1}$\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{61}{16}^2 - \\binom{61}{17}\\binom{61}{15}$\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the binomial coefficients and find the final number**\n\nWe need to calculate the values of the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{61}{15} = 182,168,096,355,624$\n*   $\\binom{61}{16} = 687,690,268,966,592$\n*   $\\binom{61}{17} = 1,719,225,672,414,944$\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation:\n*   $\\binom{61}{16}^2 = (687,690,268,966,592)^2 = 472,917,465,335,463,607,159,850,564,964,384$\n*   $\\binom{61}{17} \\times \\binom{61}{15} = 1,719,225,672,414,944 \\times 182,168,096,355,624 = 313,181,229,385,959,538,639,051,266,119,584$\n\nFinally, perform the subtraction:\n$N_{CSF} = 472,917,465,335,463,607,159,850,564,964,384 - 313,181,229,385,959,538,639,051,266,119,584$\n$N_{CSF} = 159,736,235,949,504,068,520,799,298,844,800$\n\nThis is the total number of singlet CSFs for a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with a 6-31G** basis set."
