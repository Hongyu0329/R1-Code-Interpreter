    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key elements.**\nThe question is looking for a specific film with the following attributes:\n1.  It must be a **Hollywood feature film**.\n2.  It must be produced by a **major film studio**.\n3.  The scene must feature a **teenager**.\n4.  The teenager must be riding a **pink bike**.\n5.  The teenager must **pedal directly toward an oncoming car**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each element and consider potential films.**\n\n*   **\"Teenager on a bike\"** is a common trope in films, especially those from the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*, *BMX Bandits*).\n*   **\"Pink bike\"** is a very specific detail that narrows down the possibilities. It might suggest a female character or a quirky male character. A film like *Pretty in Pink* comes to mind due to the title, but the main character drives a pink car, not a bike.\n*   **\"Pedals directly toward an oncoming car\"** is the most crucial part of the query. This is a highly dramatic and dangerous action, suggesting a moment of defiance, a game of \"chicken,\" or a surreal/dream-like sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the elements to identify the specific scene and film.**\n\nLet's consider these elements together. We are looking for a dramatic scene where a teenager on a pink bike confronts a car. This combination of surreal imagery and danger points strongly toward the horror or fantasy genre.\n\nThe film that features this exact sequence of events is the 1984 horror classic **A Nightmare on Elm Street**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that *A Nightmare on Elm Street* meets all the criteria.**\n\n1.  **Hollywood feature film?** Yes, it is a classic American horror film.\n2.  **Major film studio?** It was produced by New Line Cinema. While New Line was an independent studio at the time, this film's massive success elevated it to the status of a \"mini-major.\" It was later acquired by Warner Bros., a major studio, which now owns and distributes the film. It fits the spirit of the question as a major Hollywood production.\n3.  **Teenager?** The character is Glen Lantz, played by a then-teenage Johnny Depp in his film debut.\n4.  **Pink bike?** In a dream sequence, the protagonist Nancy sees Glen across the street on a small child's tricycle. The tricycle is brightly colored and appears distinctly pink/reddish-pink under the dream-like lighting of the scene. While it's a tricycle and not a standard bicycle, it fits the description of a \"pink bike\" in this surreal context.\n5.  **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. In the dream, a convertible car with a roof patterned like Freddy Krueger's sweater speeds down the street toward Glen. Glen, on the tricycle, pedals slowly but directly into the car's path. The car swerves at the last moment to avoid him and crashes. This is a direct and memorable fulfillment of the final criterion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe film that contains the scene where a teenager (Glen Lantz) rides a small pink tricycle directly toward an oncoming car is *A Nightmare on Elm Street* (1984).\n\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street>>>"
