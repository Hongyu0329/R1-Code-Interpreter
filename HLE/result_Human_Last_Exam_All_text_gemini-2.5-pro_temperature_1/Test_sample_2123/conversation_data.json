    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the surname of an English poet. This surname appears in a Russian translation of an essay. The context is a description of the wide boulevards of Vienna. The key is the intersection of these three elements: Russian language, Vienna (and thus German language), and an English poet.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Clue:** The phrase \"in the Russian translation\" is the most critical part. It strongly suggests that the poet's name is not literally written in the original text but emerges through a linguistic phenomenon like a pun, a mistranslation, or a phonetic similarity that occurs when moving between languages.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Setting (Vienna):** Vienna is the capital of Austria, where the official language is German. Therefore, any street signs or local terms describing the boulevards would be in German. The \"Russian translation\" aspect means we are looking at how a German word might be interpreted or sound to a Russian speaker.\n\n4.  **Connect the Clues (German -> Russian -> English):** We need to find a German word related to \"wide boulevards\" that, when heard or read by a Russian, sounds like the name of a famous English poet.\n    *   What kind of German words would be found on a wide boulevard? Street signs are a very likely source.\n    *   A common sign on large, modern streets to manage traffic flow is \"Einbahn\" or \"Einbahnstraße,\" which means \"One-way street.\"\n\n5.  **Examine the Phonetics:** Let's consider the German word **\"Einbahn\"**.\n    *   \"Ein\" means \"one\" in German.\n    *   \"Bahn\" means \"path,\" \"track,\" or \"way.\"\n    *   When a Russian speaker hears \"Einbahn\" (pronounced roughly \"ayn-bahn\"), it sounds remarkably similar to \"Ein Byron\" (Айн Байрон). The German \"Bahn\" /baːn/ is phonetically close to the name \"Byron\" /ˈbaɪrən/ as it is known and pronounced in Russia (Байрон).\n\n6.  **Identify the Poet:** The surname that emerges from this linguistic wordplay is **Byron**. Lord Byron was a major figure of the English Romantic movement and was extremely popular and influential in Russia.\n\n7.  **Confirm with the Anecdote:** This puzzle refers to a famous literary anecdote, often attributed to the Russian writer and literary theorist Viktor Shklovsky. In the story, Shklovsky is in Vienna and asks why the boulevards are so wide. His companion points to a street sign that says \"Einbahn\" (One-Way). Shklovsky (or his companion in the story) humorously misinterprets this as \"One Byron,\" joking that the greatness of a single figure like Lord Byron is enough to require such a wide street.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The \"Translation\" Trap:** The word \"translation\" might mislead one into searching for a specific book and a specific passage. However, it's used more broadly here to refer to the act of interpreting from one language (German) into another (Russian).\n*   **The Chain of Languages:** The solution requires a three-language connection: The setting is German-speaking, the interpretation is Russian, and the answer is an English name.\n*   **Phonetic Similarity:** The puzzle hinges entirely on how words sound, not their literal meaning or spelling. \"Bahn\" and \"Byron\" are phonetically similar enough to make the pun work.\n*   **Cultural Context:** Knowledge of Lord Byron's fame in Russia helps confirm that he is a plausible candidate for such a reference.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe German word for \"One-Way,\" \"Einbahn,\" seen on the wide boulevards of Vienna, sounds like \"Ein Byron\" (\"One Byron\") to a Russian speaker. This pun is the basis of a well-known literary anecdote. Therefore, the surname of the English poet is Byron.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
