    "This question requires analyzing five different coiled-coil protein sequences and predicting their oligomeric state (i.e., how many helices assemble together: dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.). The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acid residues at the core positions of the heptad repeat.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat:**\n    *   Coiled-coils have a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n    *   Residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are buried in the core of the structure and are typically hydrophobic. Their size, shape, and properties dictate how the helices pack together.\n    *   Residues at 'e' and 'g' are on the surface but often form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices.\n    *   We must first assign the `abcdefg` positions for each sequence. A common convention is that the first residue of the sequence is position 'a', 'd', or 'g'. Based on the typical patterns, we will assume the second residue (Isoleucine, I) in each sequence is at the 'a' position.\n\n    The assignment would be:\n    `a b c d e f g`\n    `I A Q A L K E` (for the first repeat of the first sequence)\n\n2.  **Analyze Sequence 1: EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:** Let's assume the first 'I' is at position 'a'.\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: A, A, A, A\n    *   **Core Analysis:** The core is formed by Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and Alanine (A) at the 'd' positions. This combination of a large hydrophobic residue (I) and a small hydrophobic residue (A) is a classic motif for forming stable, parallel **dimers (2)**. The side chains pack efficiently in a \"knobs-into-holes\" arrangement favored by dimers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Oligomeric state = 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze Sequence 2: EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:**\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, N, I\n        *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L\n    *   **Core Analysis:** The core is predominantly composed of Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L). This is another very strong motif for forming **dimers (2)**. There is one polar Asparagine (N) residue at an 'a' position. While polar residues in the core can be destabilizing, a single Asn is often accommodated within a dimer, sometimes forming a stabilizing hydrogen bond pair. It does not typically induce higher-order oligomerization. The overwhelming I/L signal points to a dimer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Oligomeric state = 2.\n\n4.  **Analyze Sequence 3: EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:**\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   **Core Analysis:** The core is composed exclusively of Isoleucine (I) at all 'a' and 'd' positions. Isoleucine is a β-branched amino acid (it has a branch at the second carbon of its side chain). Packing β-branched residues at both 'a' and 'd' positions creates significant steric hindrance in dimers and trimers. This specific packing, often called an \"isoleucine zipper,\" is highly favorable for a parallel **tetramer (4)**, which allows the side chains to interdigitate optimally in a four-helix bundle.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Oligomeric state = 4.\n\n5.  **Analyze Sequence 4: EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:**\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: Q, Q, Q, Q\n    *   **Core Analysis:** The core contains hydrophobic Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and a polar residue, Glutamine (Q), at the 'd' positions. Polar residues in the core act as specificity determinants. The combination of a large hydrophobic residue at 'a' and a polar Gln at 'd' is a known motif. The Gln residues can form a stabilizing hydrogen-bonded network across the helical interface. This `(a)I-(d)Q` pattern is known to favor the formation of **dimers (2)** (e.g., in the Arc repressor).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Oligomeric state = 2.\n\n6.  **Analyze Sequence 5: EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**\n    *   **Heptad Repeat Assignment:**\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: T, T, T, T\n    *   **Core Analysis:** The core consists of Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and Threonine (T) at the 'd' positions. Both I and T are β-branched amino acids. As seen with sequence 3, this creates specific packing requirements. The combination of a large hydrophobic residue (I) at 'a' and a polar, β-branched residue (T) at 'd' is a classic, well-characterized motif for forming parallel **trimers (3)**. The Isoleucines form a hydrophobic core, and the hydroxyl groups of the Threonines form a hydrogen-bonded network along the 3-fold axis of the trimer, which is sterically and energetically favorable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Oligomeric state = 3.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Sequence 1: Dimer (2)\n*   Sequence 2: Dimer (2)\n*   Sequence 3: Tetramer (4)\n*   Sequence 4: Dimer (2)\n*   Sequence 5: Trimer (3)\n\nThis gives the sequence of oligomeric states: **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
