    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"\nThe term \"Second Great War\" refers to the pan-sector conflict that takes place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). It is distinct from the \"First Great War\" (also known as the Brood War) which occurred during the original *StarCraft* and its expansion. The main belligerents were the Terran Dominion, the Zerg Swarm, the Protoss Dae'laam, and the forces of the fallen Xel'naga, Amon.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Start and End Dates of the War\nAccording to the official StarCraft timeline and in-game events:\n*   **Start of the War:** The war begins in the year **2504** with the Zerg Swarm's renewed invasion of the Koprulu Sector, most notably the attack on the Terran world of Mar Sara. This marks the beginning of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign.\n*   **End of the War:** The war concludes with the final and permanent defeat of Amon. This happens during the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, which takes place after the main *Legacy of the Void* story. The final battle occurs in the year **2506**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Duration\nThe war's events span across three calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\nTo calculate the total duration, we must consider the time elapsed from the starting event in 2504 to the concluding event in 2506.\n\n*   The war includes a portion of the year **2504** (the *Wings of Liberty* campaign).\n*   It includes the entirety of the year **2505** (the *Heart of the Swarm* campaign and the interim period).\n*   It includes a portion of the year **2506** (the *Legacy of the Void* campaign and its epilogue).\n\nThe total duration is therefore: (Time spent in 2504) + (1 full year for 2505) + (Time spent in 2506).\n\nWhile precise start and end dates within those years are not provided, the narrative pacing of the three campaigns and the time required for events between them (such as Kerrigan reconsolidating the Swarm or Artanis preparing the Golden Armada) strongly suggests a total duration of more than two full years. For instance, if the war started in the first half of 2504 and ended in the first half of 2506, the total duration would be approximately two years. However, the events span three separate game campaigns, making a duration slightly over two years more plausible.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Rounding Rule\nThe question requires the final answer to be **rounded up** to the nearest year. This is also known as the ceiling function.\n*   If the duration was exactly 2 years, rounding up would result in 2.\n*   Since the duration is very likely greater than 2 years (e.g., 2.1 years, 2.5 years, etc.), rounding this value up to the next whole number yields 3.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Second Great War started in 2504 and ended in 2506. It spanned across three calendar years, making its total duration slightly more than two years. When rounding this value up to the nearest year, the result is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
