    "This is a mate-in-3 puzzle.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Position Analysis:** The white king on g5 is extremely exposed and is the immediate target for Black. A critical detail is that Black's rook on e8 is pinned to the Black king on h8 by the White rook on d8. This means the e8-rook cannot move. Black's attack must therefore be carried out by the knight on e5, the rook on b8, and the pawns.\n\n2.  **Black's First Move: f6+**\n    *   This is the most forcing move. It is a check delivered by the f7-pawn.\n    *   White's King cannot move to f4 (controlled by the knight on e5) or f5 (controlled by the pawn on g6).\n    *   White's only legal move is to move the king to g4.\n\n3.  **White's First Move: Kg4**\n    *   The king moves to g4, its only escape square.\n\n4.  **Black's Second Move: h5+**\n    *   With the white king on g4, Black continues the attack with another pawn check.\n    *   The king on g4 is now attacked by the h7-pawn moving to h5.\n    *   The king cannot take the pawn on h5 because it is defended by the pawn on g6.\n    *   The king cannot move to f4 (controlled by the knight on e5) or stay on the 4th rank (h4 is controlled by the h5 pawn).\n    *   White's only legal move is to move the king to h3.\n\n5.  **White's Second Move: Kh3**\n    *   The king is forced into the corner of the board, where its escape is severely limited.\n\n6.  **Black's Third Move: Rb2#**\n    *   The white king is now on h3. Its potential escape squares are g2, g4, and h4.\n    *   The knight on e5 controls g4.\n    *   The pawn on h5 controls h4.\n    *   The king's own pawns block g3 and h2.\n    *   The only remaining potential escape square is g2.\n    *   Black moves the rook from b8 to b2. This delivers check along the 2nd rank.\n    *   This move attacks the king and also covers the final escape square, g2.\n    *   The check cannot be blocked, the rook cannot be captured, and the king has no safe squares to move to. This is checkmate.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The most crucial point is recognizing that the Black rook on e8 is pinned and cannot move. Any potential solution involving this rook is invalid.\n*   The sequence of pawn checks (...f6+ followed by ...h5+) is essential to force the king into the mating net without allowing it to escape.\n*   The final move must cover the last escape square (g2), which the rook on b2 does perfectly.\n\n<<<f6+ Kg4 h5+ Kh3 Rb2>>>"
