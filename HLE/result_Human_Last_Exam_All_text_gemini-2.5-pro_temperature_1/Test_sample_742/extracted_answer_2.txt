No, it is not possible. The two frameworks operate in fundamentally different domains with incompatible concepts and mathematical languages. Gödel's proof is an abstract argument in modal logic about metaphysical concepts (like "positive properties" and "necessary existence"), whereas the mathematics of quantum mechanics is a physical theory designed to model the probabilistic behavior of matter and energy. The core concepts of Gödel's proof have no meaningful equivalent in the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, making such a proof impossible. It would be a category error, akin to trying to prove a theorem of number theory using the principles of chemistry.
