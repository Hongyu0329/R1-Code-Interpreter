    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the initial model and simplify the equation\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We are working over a 2-adic field, which we can take as $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, with the valuation $v$ normalized so that $v(2)=1$.\n\nLet's analyze the model over the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The equation is $f(x, z) = z^2 - (2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1) = 0$.\nThe special fiber is the reduction of this equation modulo 2, which is $z^2 - 1 = 0$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This can be written as $(z-1)^2 = 0$.\nThe special fiber is a non-reduced line over the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1_{\\mathbb{F}_2}$. This means the curve does not have good reduction, and this model is not regular.\n\nTo find a better model, we can perform a change of variables to center the singularity. The special fiber is defined by $z=1 \\pmod 2$. Let's substitute $z = y+1$ into the equation:\n$(y+1)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$y^2 + 2y + 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$y^2 + 2y = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\n$y(y+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nThis equation defines a model that is birational to the original curve. Since $z$ must be a 2-adic integer for any point on a minimal model lying over $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$, $y=z-1$ must have $v(y) \\ge 1$ or $z$ is odd. If $z$ is odd, $v(z-1) \\ge 1$. Let $y=2Y$.\n$2Y(2Y+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n$4Y(Y+1) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n$2Y(Y+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nThis equation gives us a new model for the curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's analyze its special fiber by reducing modulo 2:\n$0 = x^3(x^2+1) \\pmod 2$\n$0 = x^3(x+1)^2 \\pmod 2$\n\nThe special fiber of this model consists of two components over the affine line $\\mathbb{A}^1_{\\mathbb{F}_2}$:\n1.  A component $V_0$ at $x=0$ with multiplicity 3.\n2.  A component $V_1$ at $x=1$ with multiplicity 2.\n\nThis model is still singular. The singularities of the model are located where the components of the special fiber meet or where the components themselves are singular. The components are vertical lines, which are smooth, but their high multiplicity indicates singularities in the model. The singular locus of this model is along the line $x=0$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of the stable reduction\nThe structure of the special fiber of the stable model is determined by the \"clustering\" of the branch points of the curve. The branch points are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. The structure of the special fiber of our model $2Y(Y+1)=x^3(x^2+1)$ suggests that the roots of $f(x)$ are partitioned into two sets: one whose roots are close to $x=0$ and one whose roots are close to $x=1$.\n\nThe stable reduction will have a central $\\mathbb{P}^1$ component that separates the geometric contributions from the neighborhoods of $x=0$ and $x=1$. The parts of the curve living over these two regions will connect to this central component, forming nodes. The question asks for the thickness of \"the\" double point, which suggests we focus on the interaction between the main components arising from this partition.\n\nThe stable model is obtained by a sequence of blow-ups to resolve the singularities of the model $2Y(Y+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$. The resulting stable fiber will consist of a configuration of rational curves. A double point (a node) in the stable fiber corresponds to two components intersecting transversally. In the minimal regular model, these two components might be connected by a chain of intermediate $\\mathbb{P}^1$s. The \"thickness\" of the node is the length of this chain.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the thickness\nThe thickness of a node is a measure of how singular the curve is at that point from an arithmetic perspective. For a node with a local equation $uv = \\pi^m$ in the ring of integers of some finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ (where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer), the thickness is the integer $m$. This integer corresponds to the length of the chain of projective lines that have been contracted to form the node.\n\nWe can compute this length by analyzing the singularity. Let's focus on the singularity arising from the component $V_1$ at $x=1$. The multiplicity of this component is 2. This multiplicity is often directly related to the thickness of the associated node. Let's make this more precise.\n\nConsider the equation $2Y(Y+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$.\nLet's analyze the valuation of the right-hand side (RHS) for $x$ in a 2-adic neighborhood of 1. Let $x = 1+2t$ for some $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n$x^2+1 = (1+2t)^2 + 1 = 1+4t+4t^2+1 = 2+4t+4t^2 = 2(1+2t+2t^2)$.\nThe term $u = 1+2t+2t^2$ is a 2-adic unit.\nSo, $v(x^2+1) = v(2) + v(u) = 1+0=1$.\nAlso, $x$ is a unit, so $v(x^3)=0$.\nThus, for any $x$ such that $v(x-1)>0$, we have $v(x^3(x^2+1)) = v(x^3) + v(x^2+1) = 0+1=1$.\n\nThis means that near $x=1$, the equation is $2Y(Y+1) = (\\text{unit}) \\cdot 2^1$.\n$Y(Y+1) = \\text{unit}$.\nThis describes a smooth (unramified) cover of the disk around $x=1$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the singularity at $x=0$.\nNear $x=0$, the equation is approximately $2Y(Y+1) = x^3$.\nThis singularity needs to be resolved. This resolution will produce a chain of rational curves.\nThe structure of the stable reduction is that there is a component $C_0$ corresponding to the \"generic\" part of the x-line, to which the resolved components from the singular fibers at $x=0$ and $x=1$ attach.\n\nThe thickness of the node where the component from $x=1$ attaches is given by the multiplicity of that component in the special fiber of the model $2Y(Y+1)=x^3(x+1)^2$. The multiplicity of the component $V_1$ (at $x=1$) is 2.\n\nThis suggests that the thickness of the double point associated with this component is 2. This is a known heuristic from the theory of arithmetic surfaces: the thickness of a node formed by contracting a chain of components is related to the multiplicities of the components in a suitable singular model. The component at $x=1$ has multiplicity 2, which corresponds to a node of thickness 2 in the stable model.\n\nLet's briefly justify this. The model $2Y(Y+1)=x^3(x^2+1)$ has a special fiber $x^3(x+1)^2=0$. A component of multiplicity $m$ in such a model often leads to a chain of $m-1$ rational curves in the minimal resolution, terminating on the component corresponding to the resolution of the other parts of the fiber. Contracting this chain gives a node whose thickness is related to $m$. In many standard cases, the thickness is precisely the multiplicity. Given the setup, the component $(x+1)^2$ of multiplicity 2 gives rise to a node of thickness 2."
