    "This problem requires finding a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a given linear system such that the closed-loop system `A + BF` has specified eigenvalues.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. System and Goal Definition**\n*   The state-space matrices are given as:\n    `A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n    `B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\n*   The state feedback gain matrix `F` is a 2x2 matrix, as A and B are 2x2. Let's define it as:\n    `F = [f1, f2; f3, f4]`\n*   The goal is to place the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial for a system with the desired eigenvalues `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j` is:\n`P_d(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2)`\n`P_d(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`P_d(s) = (s + 1 - j)(s + 1 + j)`\n`P_d(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2 = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`P_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\n\n**3. Closed-Loop System Formulation**\nFirst, we compute the product `BF`:\n`BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f1, f2; f3, f4] = [1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4; 1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4] = [f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4; f1, f2]`\n\nNext, we form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4; f1, f2]`\n`A_cl = [-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4; 1 + f1, f2]`\n\n**4. Actual Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [a, b; c, d]` is `s^2 - tr(M)s + det(M)`. For our closed-loop matrix `A_cl`:\n*   `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)f2 - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `= -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `= -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nSo, the characteristic polynomial `P_cl(s)` is:\n`P_cl(s) = s^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n`P_cl(s) = s^2 + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**5. Equating Coefficients**\nWe now equate the coefficients of `P_cl(s)` with those of the desired polynomial `P_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n*   Comparing the coefficient of `s`:\n    `1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3 = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1` (Equation 1)\n*   Comparing the constant term:\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\n**6. Solving for F**\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This means the solution for `F` is not unique. We can simplify the problem by choosing values for two of the variables. A common approach is to set some elements to zero. Let's choose `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\nThe equations become:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express `f2` in terms of `f1`:\n`f2 = -1 - f1`\n\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n`-f1 - 2(-1 - f1) = 3`\n`-f1 + 2 + 2*f1 = 3`\n`f1 + 2 = 3`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nNow find `f2` using `f2 = -1 - f1`:\n`f2 = -1 - 1 = -2`\n\nThus, one possible solution for the state feedback gain matrix is `F` with `f1=1`, `f2=-2`, `f3=0`, `f4=0`.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Sign Convention:** The problem explicitly uses `A + BF` for the closed-loop system, not the more standard `A - BF`. Our calculation correctly adheres to this.\n2.  **Controllability:** For pole placement to be possible, the system `(A, B)` must be controllable. The controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]` has rank 2, so the system is controllable.\n3.  **Non-uniqueness of Solution:** Since the system is multi-input (B has more than one column), there are more degrees of freedom than constraints. This results in an infinite number of valid `F` matrices. By setting `f3=0` and `f4=0`, we found one of these possible solutions.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nThe calculated values are `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, and `f4 = 0`. Assembling these into the matrix `F`:\n`F = [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n\n**Verification:**\nLet's check if this `F` gives the correct eigenvalues.\n`BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [1, -2; 0, 0] = [1, -2; 1, -2]`\n`A_cl = A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, -2; 1, -2] = [0, -1; 2, -2]`\nThe characteristic equation for this `A_cl` is `det(sI - A_cl) = det([s, 1; -2, s+2]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\nThe roots of this equation are `s = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = -1 ± j`. This matches the desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<[1, -2; 0, 0]>>>"
