    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The fundamental task is to compute the determinant of a matrix.\n2.  **Identify the Matrix:** The question provides an explicit 3x3 matrix:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n3.  **Interpret the Contextual Information:** The question identifies this matrix A as \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n    *   The phrase \"where: A = ...\" acts as a definition. It specifies that the matrix we must use is the one explicitly written down.\n    *   The description \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides the mathematical context for matrix A. The matrix A is the Cartan matrix of the affine Lie algebra \\(\\tilde{A}_2\\), which is related to the study of the Markov equation. The value \\(m_{1/2} = 13\\) is likely extraneous information that is not needed for the calculation itself, as the matrix is fully specified.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan for Calculation:** The goal is to find \\(\\det(A)\\). We can do this in several ways:\n    *   Method A: Use the property that the sum of the rows/columns is zero.\n    *   Method B: Use the standard formula for a 3x3 determinant (cofactor expansion or Sarrus' rule).\n    *   Method C: Use row reduction to transform the matrix into an upper triangular form.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Potential for Misinterpretation:** The information about the \"Markov quiver\" and \"\\(m_{1/2} = 13\\)\" could be mistaken as instructions to modify the matrix A. However, the word \"where\" strongly indicates that A is being defined as the matrix shown. The most direct interpretation is to calculate the determinant of the given matrix A.\n2.  **Matrix Properties are Shortcuts:** Before performing a lengthy calculation, it's wise to inspect the matrix for special properties. This can often simplify the problem significantly. In this case, the matrix has a very distinct property that immediately reveals its determinant.\n3.  **Verification:** Whenever possible, use more than one method to solve the problem to ensure the result is correct. All valid methods should yield the same answer.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will now compute the determinant of the matrix A. We demonstrate two different methods.\n\n**Method 1: Using Matrix Properties**\n\n1.  **Observe the rows of the matrix A:**\n    *   Row 1: [2, -1, -1]\n    *   Row 2: [-1, 2, -1]\n    *   Row 3: [-1, -1, 2]\n\n2.  **Sum the elements of each row:**\n    *   Sum of Row 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Sum of Row 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Sum of Row 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n\n3.  **Apply the relevant theorem:** A square matrix in which the sum of the elements in each row (or each column) is 0 is a singular matrix.\n4.  **Conclusion:** A singular matrix, by definition, has a determinant of 0. This is because the vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = [1, 1, 1]^T\\) is a non-zero solution to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\), meaning 0 is an eigenvalue of A. The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, so the determinant must be 0.\n\n**Method 2: Direct Calculation using Cofactor Expansion**\n\n1.  **Write down the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix using cofactor expansion along the first row:**\n    \\[ \\det(A) = a_{11}(a_{22}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{32}) - a_{12}(a_{21}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{31}) + a_{13}(a_{21}a_{32} - a_{22}a_{31}) \\]\n\n2.  **Substitute the values from matrix A:**\n    *   \\(a_{11} = 2\\), \\(a_{12} = -1\\), \\(a_{13} = -1\\)\n    *   The sub-determinants are:\n        *   For \\(a_{11}\\): \\((2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3\\)\n        *   For \\(a_{12}\\): \\((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3\\)\n        *   For \\(a_{13}\\): \\((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 3\\)\n\n3.  **Calculate the determinant:**\n    \\[ \\det(A) = (2)(3) - (-1)(-3) + (-1)(3) \\]\n    \\[ \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\]\n    \\[ \\det(A) = 0 \\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the given matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
