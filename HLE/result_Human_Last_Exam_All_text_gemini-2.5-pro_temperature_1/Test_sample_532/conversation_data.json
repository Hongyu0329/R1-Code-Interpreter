    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms provided in the question.\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A set with a binary operation that satisfies the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, inverse) and has a finite number of elements. Let `e` denote the identity element of `G`.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all elements `x` and `y` in `S` (including the case where `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. In set notation, this means `S ⋅ S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S ⋅ S = {ab | a ∈ S, b ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS):** This is a product-free set `S` such that it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, if `S` is a MIPFS, then for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is a filled group if the union of all its MIPFSs is equal to `G`. That is, if `M(G)` is the collection of all MIPFSs of `G`, then `G` is filled if `⋃_{S∈M(G)} S = G`. This is equivalent to stating that every element of `G` must belong to at least one MIPFS.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. All finite abelian groups are nilpotent.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the \"Product-Free Set\" Property\n\nThe core of the problem lies in a careful analysis of the definition of a product-free set. Let's consider the identity element `e` of any group `G`.\n\n1.  Let `S` be any product-free set in `G`.\n2.  According to the definition, for *all* `x, y ∈ S`, the product `xy` must not be in `S`.\n3.  Let's test if the identity element `e` can be a member of `S`. Assume `e ∈ S`.\n4.  We can choose `x = e` and `y = e`, since `e` is in `S`.\n5.  The product is `xy = e ⋅ e = e`.\n6.  The result of the product, `e`, is an element of `S`.\n7.  This violates the condition that `xy notin S`. Therefore, our initial assumption that `e ∈ S` must be false.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The identity element `e` cannot be a member of any product-free set in any group `G`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the \"Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set\" (MIPFS)\n\nA MIPFS is, by its very nature, a product-free set. Building on the conclusion from Step 2:\n\n1.  A MIPFS must be a product-free set.\n2.  No product-free set can contain the identity element `e`.\n3.  Therefore, no MIPFS can contain the identity element `e`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** For any group `G`, the identity element `e` does not belong to any of its Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Sets.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the \"Filled Group\" Condition\n\nA group `G` is defined as \"filled\" if the union of all its MIPFSs is equal to `G`.\n\n1.  Let `U` be the union of all MIPFSs of `G`.\n2.  From Step 3, we know that for every MIPFS `S`, `e notin S`.\n3.  This means the identity element `e` cannot be in the union `U`.\n4.  Therefore, `U` is always a proper subset of `G` (specifically, `U ⊆ G \\ {e}`), as long as `G` is not the empty set (which isn't a group).\n5.  The condition for a filled group is `U = G`.\n6.  This condition can never be met for any group `G`, because `e` is in `G` but not in `U`.\n\nLet's consider the trivial group `G = {e}`.\n*   The subsets are `∅` and `{e}`.\n*   `{e}` is not product-free because `e⋅e = e`.\n*   `∅` is vacuously product-free. It is also maximal, as the only other subset `{e}` is not product-free. So, the only MIPFS is `∅`.\n*   The union of all MIPFSs is `∅`.\n*   For `G` to be filled, this union must equal `G`, so `∅ = {e}`, which is false.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The \"filled group\" condition `U = G` can never be satisfied by any group, as the identity element `e` is never part of the union `U`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that the property of being a \"filled group\" is impossible for any group to satisfy under the standard definition of a product-free set. The properties of being \"finite\" or \"nilpotent\" are irrelevant because the fundamental definition of a filled group leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince no group can be a filled group, the set of finite filled nilpotent groups must be empty.\n\nThere are no finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
