    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific character in a specific book who performs a specific action.\n*   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n*   **Character's Action 1:** Visited a Roman city.\n*   **Character's Action 2:** Describes the religious practices of that city.\n*   **Specific Detail of Description:** The description must contain an allusion to the myth of Romulus and Remus that a reader would recognize.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Key Allusion\nThe core of the question is the allusion to Romulus and Remus. The most famous and visually distinct part of their legend is their infancy, where they were abandoned and then found and suckled by a she-wolf (the *Lupa Capitolina*). A description of a statue or carving of a she-wolf nursing two human babies would be the most direct and recognizable reference.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Characters and Plot of *The House of the Wolfings*\nThe novel is told from the perspective of the Goths, a Germanic tribe preparing to fight the invading Roman legions. Therefore, any information about Roman life would come from a Gothic character who has had direct contact with the Romans. We need to identify a character who has spent time within the Roman Empire.\n\n*   **Thiodolf:** The chieftain of the Wolfings. While he leads the fight against the Romans, the narrative doesn't place him inside a Roman city describing their culture in this manner.\n*   **The Hall-Sun:** A supernatural being, a Valkyrie-like figure. Her knowledge is mystical, not based on anthropological observation from travel.\n*   **Otter:** A thrall (a person in bondage, akin to a slave) of the Wolfings. A crucial part of his backstory is that he was once a captive of the Romans before escaping or being freed and returning to his people. This experience makes him the most likely candidate to have firsthand knowledge of Roman cities and customs.\n\n### Step 4: Locate the Relevant Passage in the Text\nThe scene in question occurs in Chapter V, \"Of the Road-Wending of the Wolfing Men.\" As the Goths discuss the nature of the Romans they are about to fight, the conversation turns to the Romans' gods and beliefs.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is here that the character with prior experience among the Romans shares his knowledge.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Character's Speech\nIn this chapter, Otter speaks up to share what he learned during his captivity. He describes a Roman city and its temples. He then recounts seeing a specific image that he found strange.\n\n*   **Otter's Description:** He describes seeing an image made of brass or stone depicting **\"a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children.\"**\n*   **Connecting to the Myth:** He goes on to say that he asked a Roman about the image's meaning. The Roman told him the story of their city's \"first father\" and his brother, who were cast out as infants, nourished by the she-wolf, and later founded the great city.\n*   **Conclusion:** This passage directly matches every requirement of the question. The character is Otter, he is describing what he saw in a Roman city, and his description is a clear and unmistakable account of the foundation myth of Rome, centered on Romulus and Remus being nursed by the she-wolf.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the character who visited a Roman city (as a captive) and describes their religious art in a way that clearly refers to the legend of Romulus and Remus is Otter.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
