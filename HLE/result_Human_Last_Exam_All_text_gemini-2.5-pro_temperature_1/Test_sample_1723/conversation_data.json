    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific mushroom genus based on a single, unique characteristic: a \"distinctly blue spore print\". The question presents this as a factual statement, implying that one such genus exists.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Key Term \"Spore Print\"**\nA spore print is a critical tool for mushroom identification. It is the colored deposit left behind when spores fall from the gills or pores of a mushroom cap onto a surface. Common spore print colors include white, cream, pink, yellow, various shades of brown, purple-brown, and black.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rarity of a \"Blue\" Spore Print**\nA truly blue spore print is exceptionally rare in the fungal kingdom. It's important to distinguish the color of the spore print from the color of the mushroom's body or a chemical reaction.\n*   **Mushroom Body Color:** Many mushrooms have blue bodies, such as *Lactarius indigo* (the Indigo Milk Cap) or *Entoloma hochstetteri* (the New Zealand Blue Mushroom). However, their spore prints are not blue. *Lactarius indigo* has a cream-to-yellow spore print, and *Entoloma hochstetteri* has a pinkish-brown one.\n*   **Bruising Color:** Some mushrooms, like many species in the genera *Psilocybe* and *Boletus*, turn blue when bruised or damaged. This is a chemical reaction and does not reflect the color of the spores. *Psilocybe* mushrooms have purple-brown to black spores, and boletes typically have olive-brown spores.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate Potential Candidates**\nGiven that a true, vibrant blue spore print is virtually non-existent, the question is likely referring to the genus that comes closest to this description, even if the color is not a pure blue.\n*   The genus most frequently cited in response to this specific question is **Entoloma**.\n*   The family Entolomataceae, to which this genus belongs, is famously characterized by its pink, angular spores.\n*   However, within the large and diverse *Entoloma* genus, some species (particularly in subgenera like *Leptonia* and *Inocephalus*) produce spore prints that are not purely pink. They are sometimes described by mycologists as having a grayish, lilac, or violaceous (violet-like) tint.\n*   This violaceous or grayish-blue hue is the closest any widely recognized mushroom genus comes to producing a \"blue\" spore print. While not \"distinctly blue\" in the way one might imagine a sky-blue color, it is the basis for *Entoloma* being the accepted answer to this classic mycology trivia question.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nThere is no mushroom genus that produces a spore print that is universally recognized as being distinctly and truly blue. However, the question points to a single known genus. Based on mycological literature and expert consensus for this specific trivia question, the intended answer is the genus that includes species whose spore prints can have a blueish (violaceous or lilac) tint. That genus is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
