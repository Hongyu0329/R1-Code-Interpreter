    "This problem asks for the minimum number of composants in an indecomposable continuum. Let's break down the question and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff topological space. Examples include a closed interval `[0, 1]`, a circle, or a square.\n    *   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum (i.e., it is closed and connected).\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A \"proper\" subcontinuum is one that is not equal to `X`. For example, the interval `[0,1]` is decomposable because `[0, 2/3] U [1/3, 1] = [0,1]`. The famous \"pseudo-arc\" is an example of an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain the point `p`. It can be thought of as the set of all points that can be \"reached\" from `p` within a proper subcontinuum.\n    *   **The Question:** We are looking for the minimum possible value for the cardinality of the set `{C(p) | p ∈ X}` where `X` is an indecomposable continuum. The qualifier \"not necessarily metric\" is crucial.\n\n2.  **Listing Careful Points:**\n    *   **Composants vs. Components:** A component is a maximal connected subset. A continuum is connected, so it has only one component. Composants are a different concept related to the structure of subcontinua.\n    *   **Metric vs. Non-metric:** For metric continua (which are separable), a well-known theorem states that an indecomposable continuum has uncountably many ($\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants. The question explicitly allows for non-metric continua, which is a hint that the answer might be different from the metric case.\n    *   **Properties of Composants in Indecomposable Continua:** To find the minimum number, we need to use fundamental theorems about them.\n        *   The set of all composants of an indecomposable continuum forms a partition of the space. This means every point belongs to exactly one composant.\n        *   Every composant of an indecomposable continuum is a *proper* subset of the space. That is, for any point `p`, `C(p) ≠ X`.\n\n### Acquiring the final answer with step-by-step analysis\n\n**Step 1: Establishing a lower bound**\n\nLet `X` be an indecomposable continuum.\n1.  From the definition, for any point `p ∈ X`, `p` is in its own composant `C(p)`. Thus, the union of all composants is the entire space `X`.\n2.  A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that for an indecomposable continuum, any two distinct composants are disjoint.\n3.  Combining these two facts, the set of all distinct composants of `X` forms a partition of `X`.\n4.  Another fundamental theorem states that every composant of an indecomposable continuum is a *proper* subset of that continuum. A proof of this relies on the Baire Category Theorem; since a compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space, it cannot be the union of a countable number of nowhere dense sets. A composant can be shown to be a \"first category\" (or meager) set, which implies it cannot be the entire space.\n5.  Since the composants partition `X` and each composant is a proper subset of `X`, there must be more than one composant in the partition.\n6.  Therefore, the number of composants must be at least **2**.\n\n**Step 2: Checking if the lower bound is achievable**\n\nNow we know the minimum number is at least 2. The question becomes: does there exist an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants?\n\n1.  As noted earlier, if we restrict ourselves to *metric* continua, the answer is no. Any indecomposable metric continuum has uncountably many composants.\n2.  However, the problem allows for *non-metric* continua. The search for such an object was a significant problem in topology for many years.\n3.  In 1971, the mathematician David P. Bellamy successfully constructed an example of a (non-metric) indecomposable continuum that has exactly **two** composants. This result was published in the Duke Mathematical Journal in a paper titled \"A non-metric indecomposable continuum\".\n4.  The existence of Bellamy's continuum demonstrates that the number 2 is an achievable number of composants for an indecomposable continuum.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 1, we determined that the number of composants in any indecomposable continuum must be at least 2. From Step 2, we know that an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants exists. Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
