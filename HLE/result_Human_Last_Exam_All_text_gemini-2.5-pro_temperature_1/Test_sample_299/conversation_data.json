    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the properties of the function $f$ and then using these properties to construct the set of all possible solutions and determine its size.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Basic Properties of f from the Equation**\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = e^x$. The function $g(x) = e^x$ is continuous, strictly increasing, and its range is $(0, \\infty)$.\n\n*   **Injectivity of f:**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since $e^x$ is an injective (one-to-one) function, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be injective.\n\n*   **Monotonicity of f:**\n    A continuous and injective function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing. Since $e^x$ is strictly increasing, this is a possible case.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is also consistent with $e^x$ being strictly increasing.\n\n*   **Fixed Points of f:**\n    Suppose $f$ has a fixed point, say $f(c) = c$. Then $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$. From the given equation, $f(f(c)) = e^c$. Thus, $c = e^c$. However, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions (the graph of $y=e^x$ is always above the graph of $y=x$). Therefore, $f$ cannot have any fixed points.\n\n**2. Ruling out the Decreasing Case**\n\n*   Let's assume $f$ is a continuous and strictly decreasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n*   Consider the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$ is a finite value or $-\\infty$. As the domain is $\\mathbb{R}$, the range of a decreasing function is also $\\mathbb{R}$. So $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n*   Then $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = -\\infty$.\n*   And $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} h(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = \\infty$.\n*   Since $h(x)$ is continuous and goes from $\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a point $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(c)=0$, which implies $f(c)=c$.\n*   This contradicts our finding that $f$ has no fixed points. Therefore, $f$ cannot be strictly decreasing.\n\n**3. Properties of an Increasing Solution**\n\n*   We've established that $f$ must be strictly increasing.\n*   Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, we must have either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining these inequalities gives $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$.\n*   This would mean $e^x < x$. But we know $e^x > x$ for all real $x$. This is a contradiction.\n*   Therefore, we must have **$f(x) > x$** for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**4. Asymptotic Behavior and Existence of a Root**\n\n*   **Behavior as $x \\to \\infty$**: If $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L$ for some finite $L$, then $f(f(x))$ would approach $f(L)$, a constant. But $e^x \\to \\infty$. Thus, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n*   **Behavior as $x \\to -\\infty$**: Let $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = a$. If $a = -\\infty$, then as $y=f(x) \\to -\\infty$, $f(y) \\to a = -\\infty$. So $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = -\\infty$. But $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} e^x = 0$. This contradiction means $a$ must be a finite real number.\n*   From $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = 0$ and letting $y=f(x)$, we have $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = 0$.\n*   Since $f$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be continuous at $a$. So we must have $f(a) = \\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = 0$.\n*   From the property $f(x) > x$, we can evaluate at $x=a$: $f(a) > a$, which implies $0 > a$. So, $a$ is a negative number.\n\n**5. Construction of the Solutions**\n\nThe properties derived so far show that any solution $f$ is determined by a negative number $a$ and the function's behavior on the interval $[a, 0]$.\n\n1.  **Choose a value for $a$**: We can pick any $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$.\n2.  **Define $f$ on $[a, 0]$**: Let $\\psi(x) = f(x)$ for $x \\in [a, 0]$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and we have $f(a)=0$ and $f(f(a))=e^a \\Rightarrow f(0)=e^a$, $\\psi$ must be a **continuous, strictly increasing function that maps the interval $[a, 0]$ to $[0, e^a]$**.\n3.  **Extend $f$ to all of $\\mathbb{R}$**: The choice of $a$ and $\\psi$ uniquely determines the function $f$ over its entire domain $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   For $x \\in [0, e^a]$, $x$ can be written as $x = \\psi(t)$ for a unique $t \\in [a, 0]$. Then $f(x) = f(\\psi(t)) = f(f(t)) = e^t = e^{\\psi^{-1}(x)}$.\n    *   For $x \\in (-\\infty, a)$, we know $f(x)$ must be in the interval $(a, 0)$. Let $y = f(x)$. Then $f(y) = f(f(x)) = e^x$. Since $y \\in (a, 0)$, $f(y) = \\psi(y)$. So $\\psi(f(x)) = e^x$, which gives $f(x) = \\psi^{-1}(e^x)$.\n    *   This process can be continued inductively to define $f$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**6. Counting the Number of Solutions**\n\nThe construction shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of solutions and the set of pairs $(a, \\psi)$, where $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ and $\\psi: [a, 0] \\to [0, e^a]$ is a continuous increasing bijection.\n\n*   **Number of choices for $a$**: The set of possible values for $a$ is the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n*   **Number of choices for $\\psi$**: For any fixed $a < 0$, we need to count the number of continuous, strictly increasing bijections from $[a, 0]$ to $[0, e^a]$. This is equivalent to counting the homeomorphisms between two closed intervals that preserve the orientation and endpoints.\n    *   For any two points $(x,y)$ in the interior of the rectangle $[a,0]\\times[0,e^a]$, we can construct a valid $\\psi$ passing through it.\n    *   More formally, the set of such functions $\\psi$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. To see this, one can map the problem to choosing a strictly increasing bijection from $[0, 1]$ to $[0, 1]$ (fixing endpoints), and this set has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. For example, for any $k>0$, the function $\\tilde{\\psi}(t)=t^k$ is a candidate (after normalization if needed), giving infinitely many choices. A more rigorous argument shows there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions.\n\n*   **Total Cardinality**: The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $a$ and the number of choices for $\\psi$ for each $a$.\n    Total Cardinality = (Number of choices for $a$) $\\times$ (Number of choices for $\\psi$)\n    Total Cardinality = $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these continuous functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, which is the cardinality of the set of real numbers."
