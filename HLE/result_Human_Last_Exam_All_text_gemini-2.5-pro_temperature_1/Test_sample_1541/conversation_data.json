    "This problem asks us to reorder the terms in a sum, which consists only of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, so that they are in non-decreasing order. The main constraint is to devise a solution in C that is as memory-efficient as possible and to calculate the total memory in bytes (`m`) used by the variables in this solution.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the problem\n\n1.  **Input:** A string `s` (e.g., \"3+2+1+4+1\") representing a sum. The string's length is at most 1000 characters. It contains only digits ('1', '2', '3', '4') and the '+' symbol.\n2.  **Output:** A string representing the same sum but with the numbers sorted in non-decreasing order (e.g., \"1+1+2+3+4\").\n3.  **Core Task:** The essence of the problem is to extract the numbers from the input string, sort them, and then print them back in the specified sum format.\n4.  **Key Constraint:** The primary goal is memory efficiency. We need to find the C implementation that uses the minimum possible memory for its variables.\n\n### Careful Points and Optimization Strategy\n\n1.  **Avoiding a Large Input Buffer:** A naive approach would be to read the entire string into a character array, for example, `char s[1001];`. This alone would consume 1001 bytes. To be memory-efficient, we should avoid storing the whole string. We can process the input character by character as a stream.\n2.  **Efficient Sorting:** The numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is a perfect scenario for a **counting sort**. We don't need a general-purpose sorting algorithm or an array to store the numbers themselves. We only need to count the occurrences of each number.\n3.  **Minimal Data Types:** To achieve the \"most memory-efficient\" solution, we must select the smallest possible C data type for each variable that can safely store the required range of values. On typical competitive programming platforms (using a 32/64-bit architecture), `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes, and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n4.  **No Output Buffer:** The output can be constructed and printed directly to standard output piece by piece, avoiding the need for an output buffer.\n\n### Acquiring the final answer: The Most Memory-Efficient Approach\n\nBased on the points above, the most memory-efficient algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  Do not store the input string. Read it one character at a time using `getchar()`.\n2.  Use an array of four counters to store the frequencies of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n3.  After counting is complete, loop from 1 to 4. For each number, print it as many times as it was counted, separated by '+' signs.\n\nLet's determine the variables needed and their minimum possible sizes:\n\n1.  **Counters (`counts`):**\n    *   The input string has a maximum length of 1000. The most frequent a single number can be is in a string like \"1+1+1+...+1\". This string has `(1000+1)/2 = 500.5`, so at most 501 terms. The count for any number will not exceed 501.\n    *   A `char` (range up to 255) is too small.\n    *   An `unsigned short` (range 0 to 65535) is sufficient.\n    *   We need four such counters. An array is suitable: `unsigned short counts[4];`\n    *   **Memory:** `4 * sizeof(unsigned short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Input Character (`c`):**\n    *   The `getchar()` function returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value. Therefore, this variable must be an `int`.\n    *   **Memory:** `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Printing Control Variables:**\n    *   We need a flag to correctly handle printing the '+' signs (i.e., not before the first number). A boolean-like flag (0 or 1) is perfect for this.\n    *   Variable `first`: A `char` is the smallest data type for this.\n    *   **Memory:** `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   We need nested loops to print the result. The outer loop will iterate 4 times (for numbers 1, 2, 3, 4). The inner loop will iterate up to the count of each number (max 501).\n    *   Outer loop counter `i`: Iterates from 0 to 3. A `char` is sufficient.\n    *   **Memory:** `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   Inner loop counter `j`: Iterates up to 501. An `unsigned short` is sufficient.\n    *   **Memory:** `sizeof(unsigned short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\n### Calculating Total Memory (m)\n\nLet's sum the memory usage of all the variables declared in our optimized program:\n\n*   `counts` (array of 4 counters): 8 bytes\n*   `c` (for `getchar`): 4 bytes\n*   `first` (printing flag): 1 byte\n*   `i` (outer loop counter): 1 byte\n*   `j` (inner loop counter): 2 bytes\n\nTotal Memory `m` = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **16 bytes**.\n\nThis approach minimizes memory by processing the input as a stream and using the smallest appropriate data types for all variables.\n\n<<<16>>>"
