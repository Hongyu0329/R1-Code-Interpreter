    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The question specifies a size of 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we have $n=9$.\n    The group in question is $G = SD_{512}$, with the presentation:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{128-1} = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The order of the group is $|G|=512$. The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$ and $sr^j$ for $0 \\le j < 256$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is equal to the set $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. It's important to note that the set $G^k$ must itself form a subgroup.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of $k$-th powers in $G$**\n\nWe need to find the set of all distinct subgroups that can be formed as $G^k$ for some integer $k$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $k$ is odd.**\n    The order of our group $G$ is $|G|=512=2^9$, which is a power of 2. If $k$ is an odd integer, then $k$ is coprime to the order of every element in $G$ (since all element orders must be powers of 2). In a finite group, the map $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a permutation of the group elements if and only if $k$ is coprime to the order of the group. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 512) = 1$. Therefore, the map $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a bijection from $G$ to itself.\n    This means $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} = G$.\n    So, for any odd integer $k$, the power subgroup is $G$ itself. This gives us our first power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case 2: $k$ is even.**\n    Let $k = 2^a \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd integer and $a \\ge 1$.\n    The set of $k$-th powers is $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{g^{2^a \\cdot m} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    This can be written as $\\{ (g^m)^{2^a} \\mid g \\in G \\}$. As established in Case 1, the map $g \\mapsto g^m$ is a permutation of $G$. So the set $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is the same as the set $G$.\n    Let $h = g^m$. Then $G^k = \\{h^{2^a} \\mid h \\in G\\} = G^{2^a}$.\n    This crucial result shows that any power subgroup $G^k$ is determined solely by the power of 2 that divides $k$. We only need to find the distinct subgroups of the form $G^{2^a}$ for $a \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the subgroups $G^{2^a}$**\n\nWe will now compute the sets $G^{2^a}$ for $a=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ and check if they are subgroups.\n\n*   For $a=0$, $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$. This is a subgroup. (Order 512)\n\n*   For $a \\ge 1$, we need to compute $g^{2^a}$ for all $g \\in G$.\n    Let's first analyze the squares of elements ($a=1$).\n    - If $g = r^i$, then $g^2 = (r^i)^2 = r^{2i}$. The set of these squares is $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order $256/2 = 128$.\n    - If $g = sr^j$, we calculate its square: $(sr^j)^2 = sr^j s r^j$.\n      From the relation $srs=r^{127}$, we can deduce $sr^j s = (srs)^j = (r^{127})^j = r^{127j}$.\n      So, $(sr^j)^2 = (sr^j s) r^j = r^{127j} r^j = r^{128j}$.\n      If $j$ is even ($j=2l$), $(sr^{2l})^2 = r^{128(2l)} = r^{256l} = e$.\n      If $j$ is odd ($j=2l+1$), $(sr^{2l+1})^2 = r^{128(2l+1)} = r^{256l} \\cdot r^{128} = r^{128}$.\n      So for any element $g$ not in $\\langle r \\rangle$, its square $g^2$ is either $e$ or $r^{128}$.\n    Combining these results for $G^2 = \\{g^2 \\mid g \\in G\\}$:\n    $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{e, r^{128}\\}$.\n    The element $r^{128}$ is $(r^2)^{64}$, which is already in $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. The identity $e$ is also in $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    Thus, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order 128, so it is a subgroup.\n\n*   Now let's compute $G^{2^a}$ for $a \\ge 2$.\n    - If $g = r^i$, then $g^{2^a} = r^{i \\cdot 2^a}$. This set is $\\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$.\n    - If $g = sr^j$, we know $g^2 = r^{128j}$. Then $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (r^{128j})^2 = r^{256j} = e$.\n      Since $a \\ge 2$, $2^a$ is a multiple of 4. So $g^{2^a} = (g^4)^{2^{a-2}} = e^{2^{a-2}} = e$.\n    So for $a \\ge 2$, $G^{2^a} = \\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle \\cup \\{e\\}$. Since $e$ is always in $\\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$, we have:\n    $G^{2^a} = \\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$ for $a \\ge 2$.\n    (Note that this formula also works for $a=1$, as shown above).\n\n**Step 4: List and count the distinct power subgroups**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups is $\\{G^{2^a} \\mid a \\ge 0\\}$. Let's list them:\n*   $a=0$: $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$. This is the semidihedral group $SD_{512}$ of order 512.\n*   $a=1$: $G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order $256/2=128$.\n*   $a=2$: $G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. Cyclic group of order $256/4=64$.\n*   $a=3$: $G^{2^3} = G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$. Cyclic group of order $256/8=32$.\n*   $a=4$: $G^{2^4} = G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$. Cyclic group of order $256/16=16$.\n*   $a=5$: $G^{2^5} = G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$. Cyclic group of order $256/32=8$.\n*   $a=6$: $G^{2^6} = G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$. Cyclic group of order $256/64=4$.\n*   $a=7$: $G^{2^7} = G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. Cyclic group of order $256/128=2$.\n*   $a=8$: $G^{2^8} = G^{256}$. The maximum order of any element in $G$ is 256 (the order of $r$). For any $g \\in G$, $g^{256}=e$. Thus, $G^{256}=\\{e\\}$. This is the trivial subgroup of order 1.\n*   For $a > 8$: $G^{2^a} = \\{g^{2^a}\\} = \\{ (g^{256})^{2^{a-8}} \\} = \\{e^{2^{a-8}}\\} = \\{e\\}$. These are not new subgroups.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are:\n$G, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{e\\}$.\n\nThese subgroups all have different orders (512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), so they are all distinct.\nCounting them, we find there are 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\nFinal check using the general formula for $SD_{2^n}$: The number of power subgroups is $n$. For $SD_{512}$, $n=9$. The result is consistent.\n\nFinal answer is the total count of these distinct subgroups.\n\n1 (for G) + 8 (for the cyclic subgroups $\\langle r^{2^a} \\rangle$ where $a=1,...,8$) = 9.\n\n>>> 9"
