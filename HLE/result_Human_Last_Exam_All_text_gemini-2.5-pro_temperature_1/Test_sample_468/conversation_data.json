    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Scientific Name and Authority:** The question asks about the genus *Perdita*, which was first described by Frederick Smith in 1853. This information helps to identify the correct group of organisms.\n2.  **Determine the Native Range:** The genus *Perdita* is a large group of bees primarily found in the deserts and arid regions of North and Central America, especially the southwestern United States and Mexico. The question asks for the common name used in this native range.\n3.  **Search for the Common Name:** A search for the common name of the *Perdita* genus reveals that they are widely known as \"fairy bees\". This name is used by entomologists, conservation organizations (like the Xerces Society), and in guidebooks due to their extremely small size and often bright, iridescent, jewel-like colors. While other names like \"sand bees\" or \"dwarf bees\" might be used occasionally, \"fairy bees\" is the most prevalent and accepted common name.\n4.  **Identify the Origin of the Common Name:** The next step is to determine when and by whom this name was coined. Common names often arise organically, but in this case, the name can be traced to a specific publication by a prominent entomologist.\n5.  **Pinpoint the Source Publication:** Research indicates that the name \"fairy bees\" was formally proposed by Dr. Jerome G. Rozen, Jr., a leading bee expert at the American Museum of Natural History. To find the year, we must locate the specific publication. Several scientific papers cite a 1996 article by Rozen as the origin.\n6.  **Verify the Source:** The specific paper is: Rozen, J.G., Jr. (1996). \"The nesting biology and immature stages of the panurgine bee *Perdita* (*Xerophasma*) *rhodogastra* (Hymenoptera: Andrenidae).\" *American Museum Novitates*, 3183: 1â€“12.\n7.  **Confirm the Coining:** In the introduction of this 1996 paper, Dr. Rozen explicitly writes: \"Because of their minute size (many species less than 3 mm long), their bright metallic coloration, and their general elfin appearance, I hereby dub them **Fairy Bees**.\" This sentence confirms that he officially coined the name in this publication.\n8.  **Final Answer Formulation:** Based on the steps above, the common name is \"Fairy Bees\" and the year it was coined is 1996. The answer should be formatted as \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important not to confuse the year the genus was scientifically described (1853) with the year its common name was coined (1996).\n*   The authority for the scientific name (Smith) is different from the authority who coined the common name (Rozen).\n*   Verifying the source publication is crucial for accuracy, as common name origins can often be anecdotal. The explicit statement \"I hereby dub them\" in the 1996 paper provides definitive proof.\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1996>>>"
