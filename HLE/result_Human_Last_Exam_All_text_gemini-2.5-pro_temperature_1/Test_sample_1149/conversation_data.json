    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question concerns the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. The specific anatomical feature is the \"lacrimal recess,\" and we need to find the number of \"depressions\" it contains. The lacrimal is a bone in the skull situated in front of the eye socket. A recess is a large indentation, and a depression is a smaller hollow or pit within that feature.\n\n2.  **Consult Primary Scientific Sources:** To answer a specific paleontological question like this, it is essential to refer to the original scientific description of the fossil specimen. The most important specimen for *Irritator challengeri* is the holotype skull, cataloged as SMNS 58022. The definitive paper describing this skull is \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil,\" published in 2002 by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Darren M. Scott.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Description:** Within the Sues et al. (2002) paper, we need to find the section describing the lacrimal bone. Paleontological descriptions are methodical, typically detailing each bone of the skull individually.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Recess:** In their description of the lacrimal bone, the authors note a prominent feature on its outer surface. They state that the lateral surface of the lower branch (ventral ramus) of the lacrimal is \"deeply excavated by a large, subtriangular lacrimal recess.\"\n\n5.  **Identify the Number of Depressions:** The paper then provides the specific detail needed to answer the question. Following the description of the large lacrimal recess, the text explicitly states: **\"This recess accommodates three large depressions.\"** These depressions are interpreted as pneumatic foramina, which are openings connected to the dinosaur's air-sac system.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction between Recess and Depressions:** It is crucial to understand that the lacrimal recess is a single, large feature. The question asks how many smaller depressions are *contained within* this single recess.\n*   **Source Authority:** The answer relies on the published description of the actual fossil. The Sues et al. (2002) paper is the authoritative source for the cranial anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** Understanding terms like \"lacrimal,\" \"recess,\" \"depression,\" and \"foramen\" is key to correctly interpreting the scientific description.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the direct statement in the primary scientific literature describing the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri*, the large lacrimal recess on the lacrimal bone contains three smaller depressions.\n\n<<<3>>>"
