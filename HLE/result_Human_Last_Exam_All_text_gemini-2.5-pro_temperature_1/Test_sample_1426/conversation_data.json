    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes for the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific musical work and section:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\". The section is the very end of the symphony, specifically the final notes played by the first violin section (Violino I).\n\n2.  **Consult the musical score:** To find the notes, we must refer to the orchestral score for this symphony. We need to navigate to the last page of the final movement (IV. Finale: Allegro con fuoco).\n\n3.  **Locate the first violin part:** In a standard orchestral score, the first violin part is located at the top of the string section.\n\n4.  **Examine the final measure:** The phrase \"ends on three notes\" refers to the final chord played by the first violins. In the very last measure of the symphony, the first violins play a triple stop, which is three notes played simultaneously to form a chord.\n\n5.  **Identify the three notes:** The three notes written for the first violins in this final chord are:\n    *   B-flat (on the third line of the staff in the treble clef)\n    *   D (on the fourth line of the staff)\n    *   F (in the top space of the staff)\n\n6.  **Determine the lowest note:** Comparing the pitches of these three notes (B-flat, D, and F), the one with the lowest frequency is B-flat. In standard pitch notation, this is the B-flat below middle C (Bb3).\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   The question's phrasing \"ends on three notes\" can be ambiguous. It could mean three notes in sequence or a three-note chord. In the context of a symphonic finale, a final, powerful chord is a common ending, and inspection of the score confirms the first violins play a triple stop (a three-note chord).\n*   It is crucial to look at the specific part for the \"first violin\" (Violino I), as other instruments will be playing different notes in the final chord.\n*   The symphony is in B-flat major, so the final chord being a B-flat major triad (composed of B-flat, D, and F) is musically logical.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the three notes and determine which is the lowest.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
