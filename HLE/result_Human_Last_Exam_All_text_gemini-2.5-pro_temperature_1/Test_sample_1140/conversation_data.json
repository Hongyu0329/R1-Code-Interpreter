    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the characteristics of the target molecule.\n*   **Size:** The peptide is 100 amino acids (aa) long. This is a significant length for chemical synthesis.\n*   **Composition:** It contains standard amino acids as well as one unnatural amino acid (UAA), X, which is specified as azido phenylalanine.\n*   **Goal:** Synthesize this specific, modified peptide.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the primary challenge - peptide length.\nA 100aa peptide is considered a small protein. Standard chemical synthesis methods have limitations as the chain length increases.\n*   **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is the workhorse method for peptide synthesis. The peptide is built one amino acid at a time on a solid resin support. Each cycle of adding an amino acid involves a deprotection step and a coupling step.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The efficiency of each step is not 100%. For a 100aa peptide, there are ~200 chemical steps. If we assume a very optimistic 99.5% efficiency per step, the overall theoretical yield would be (0.995)^200, which is only ~36.7%. In reality, side reactions and incomplete couplings lead to a much lower yield and a crude product containing many impurities (e.g., deletion sequences). Purifying the final 100aa product from this complex mixture is extremely challenging. Therefore, a single, continuous SPPS run is not an efficient or practical method for a peptide of this size.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the secondary challenge - the unnatural amino acid.\n*   **Incorporating Azido Phenylalanine:** Azido phenylalanine is a commercially available, protected amino acid (e.g., Fmoc-p-azido-L-phenylalanine). It can be readily incorporated into a growing peptide chain using standard SPPS protocols.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The azide functional group (-N3) is relatively stable and compatible with the common chemicals used in Fmoc-SPPS (e.g., piperidine for deprotection, TFA for cleavage). This means the presence of the UAA itself is not a major obstacle for chemical synthesis.\n\n### Step 4: Consider alternative and advanced synthesis strategies.\nSince standard SPPS is not ideal due to the length, we must consider strategies designed for large peptides or small proteins.\n\n*   **Recombinant Protein Expression:** This biological method uses a host organism (like *E. coli*) to produce the peptide.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Standard recombinant expression can only incorporate the 20 canonical amino acids. To incorporate azido phenylalanine, a technique called **Genetic Code Expansion** is required. This involves engineering the cell's machinery with an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair. While very powerful, this is a complex molecular biology technique and is often considered a \"biosynthesis\" rather than a direct chemical synthesis.\n\n*   **Fragment Condensation / Chemical Ligation:** This strategy breaks the large problem into smaller, manageable pieces.\n    1.  The 100aa target peptide is conceptually split into two or more smaller fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments).\n    2.  Each fragment is synthesized independently using the highly reliable SPPS method. Because the fragments are shorter, they can be made in high yield and purified to homogeneity with relative ease. The UAA (azido phenylalanine) is incorporated into the appropriate fragment during its synthesis.\n    3.  The purified fragments are then joined together (ligated) in solution to form the full-length peptide.\n\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This is the most prominent and effective chemical ligation technique. It requires one peptide fragment to have a C-terminal thioester and the other to have an N-terminal cysteine. The reaction is highly specific (chemoselective) and occurs in aqueous solution to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n    *   **Careful Point:** NCL is the ideal solution for this problem. It elegantly overcomes the length limitation of SPPS while retaining the flexibility to incorporate any UAA. The synthesis of each ~50aa fragment is routine, and the ligation step is highly efficient, leading to a much purer final product than continuous SPPS could achieve.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nComparing the methods, continuous SPPS is impractical for a 100aa peptide. Recombinant expression with UAA incorporation is a valid but biologically complex alternative. **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** is the most helpful and widely used *chemical synthesis* technique for producing high-purity peptides and small proteins in the 50-300 aa range, especially those containing unnatural amino acids. It directly addresses the primary challenge (length) while being fully compatible with the secondary requirement (UAA).\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
