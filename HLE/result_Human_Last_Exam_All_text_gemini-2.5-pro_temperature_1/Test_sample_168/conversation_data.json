    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the sound source.**\nThe question asks about hearing human muscle twitches. When a muscle contracts or twitches, it produces a very faint, low-frequency sound. This sound is technically called a mechanomyogram (MMG). The frequency of this sound is typically in the range of 5 Hz to 25 Hz. Sounds below 20 Hz are classified as \"infrasound.\" So, the core of the question is: which of the listed animals can hear infrasound in the 5-25 Hz range?\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the hearing range of each animal.**\n\n*   **A. Dog:** A dog's hearing range is generally from about 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. They are much better than humans at hearing high-frequency sounds (ultrasound), but their low-frequency hearing does not extend down to the 5-25 Hz range. Therefore, a dog is unlikely to hear a muscle twitch.\n\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are famous for using echolocation, which involves producing and listening to very high-frequency sounds (ultrasound), often from 20,000 Hz up to 200,000 Hz. Their hearing is specialized for these high frequencies, not for low-frequency infrasound. Therefore, a bat cannot hear a muscle twitch.\n\n*   **C. Herring:** Some fish, particularly those in the clupeid family like the herring, have a unique and highly specialized hearing system. A gas-filled duct connects their swim bladder to their inner ear, which makes them extremely sensitive to very low-frequency sounds and pressure changes. They can hear sounds well into the infrasound range, with some studies showing sensitivity to frequencies as low as 1 Hz. This hearing range perfectly encompasses the 5-25 Hz frequency of muscle twitches.\n\n*   **D. Whale:** Whales, especially large baleen whales (like blue and fin whales), are known to communicate using very low-frequency sounds (10-40 Hz) that can travel hundreds of miles through the ocean. Their hearing is adapted for this infrasound range. This makes them a possible candidate. However, herring are known for being sensitive to an even broader and lower range of infrasound.\n\n*   **E. Human:** The typical hearing range for a healthy young human is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Since muscle twitches produce sound mostly below 20 Hz, they are generally inaudible to humans. (You can sometimes hear your own muscles by pressing your hand firmly against your ear, but this is due to sound being conducted through bone directly to your inner ear, not by hearing the sound through the air).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the options and conclude.**\n\n*   Dogs, bats, and humans do not have the necessary low-frequency hearing.\n*   Both whales and herring can hear in the infrasound range where muscle twitches occur.\n*   However, the herring's auditory system is exceptionally adapted for detecting faint, low-frequency sounds, making it a classic example of an animal with infrasound hearing. Their documented sensitivity across the specific 5-25 Hz range is remarkable. Given the options, the herring is the most definitive and well-supported answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
