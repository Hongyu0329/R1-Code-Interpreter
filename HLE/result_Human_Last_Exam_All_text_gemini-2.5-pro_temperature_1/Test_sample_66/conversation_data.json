    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Flag and the Matrix**\n\n1.  **The Flag of Tonga:** The flag has a red background (the field). In the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle. Inside this white rectangle is a red cross (specifically, a couped cross, which does not extend to the edges of the white rectangle).\n2.  **The Matrix `A`:** We create a matrix `A` from an image of the flag. Every red pixel is assigned the value `a`, and every white pixel is assigned the value `b`. The dimensions of the matrix, `M x N`, depend on the resolution of the image, but the rank will be independent of the specific resolution, as long as it captures the flag's features.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Matrix Algebraically**\n\nA powerful way to analyze the rank is to express the matrix `A` in terms of simpler matrices.\n\n1.  Let `J` be an `M x N` matrix where every entry is 1.\n2.  Let `I_W` be an `M x N` indicator matrix where an entry is 1 if the corresponding pixel is white, and 0 otherwise.\n3.  Let `I_R` be an `M x N` indicator matrix where an entry is 1 if the corresponding pixel is red, and 0 otherwise.\n\nFrom these definitions, we have `I_W + I_R = J`.\n\nThe matrix `A` can be written as the sum of the values of its red and white pixels:\n`A = a * I_R + b * I_W`\n\nWe can express `A` in terms of `J` and `I_W` by substituting `I_R = J - I_W`:\n`A = a * (J - I_W) + b * I_W`\n`A = a*J - a*I_W + b*I_W`\n`A = a*J + (b-a)*I_W`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Ranks of the Component Matrices**\n\nThe rank of a sum of matrices is less than or equal to the sum of their ranks: `rank(X + Y) <= rank(X) + rank(Y)`. We will use this property to find an upper bound for the rank of `A`.\n\n1.  **Rank of `a*J`:** The matrix `J` (all ones) has rank 1 (all rows are identical). Therefore, `rank(a*J)` is 1 if `a ≠ 0`, and 0 if `a = 0`.\n2.  **Rank of `(b-a)*I_W`:** The rank of this matrix is determined by the rank of `I_W` (assuming `b-a ≠ 0`).\n    *   The matrix `I_W` has 1s only for the white pixels. The white pixels are located exclusively in the canton, in the area surrounding the red cross.\n    *   The white area consists of four separate rectangular blocks in the corners of the canton.\n    *   Let's examine the rows of `I_W`. The rows outside the canton are all zeros. Within the canton, the rows corresponding to the horizontal bar of the red cross are also all zeros. The remaining rows (those that cross the white parts) will have a pattern of ones and zeros, like `(1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ... 0)`.\n    *   Crucially, all these non-zero rows in `I_W` are identical. Since the row space is spanned by a single unique non-zero row, `rank(I_W) = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `rank((b-a)*I_W)` is 1 if `b ≠ a`, and 0 if `b = a`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Maximal Rank**\n\nUsing the rank-sum inequality from the previous step:\n`rank(A) = rank(a*J + (b-a)*I_W) <= rank(a*J) + rank((b-a)*I_W)`\n\nTo maximize this sum, we should choose `a` and `b` such that `a ≠ 0` and `b ≠ a`. In this case:\n`rank(A) <= 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nThis shows that the rank of the matrix `A` can be no more than 2.\n\n**Step 5: Verify that Rank 2 is Achievable**\n\nTo confirm that 2 is the maximal *possible* rank, we need to show that there exist values of `a` and `b` for which the rank is exactly 2.\n\nLet's choose a simple case: `a = 1` and `b = 0`.\nThe matrix `A` now has a 1 for every red pixel and a 0 for every white pixel. This is simply the indicator matrix for red, `A = I_R`.\n\nLet's analyze the rows of `I_R`:\n1.  **Rows from the red field:** Any row corresponding to a slice of the flag outside the canton is entirely red. Its corresponding row vector in `A` is `v_1 = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n2.  **Rows from the canton:**\n    *   A row that crosses the horizontal bar of the red cross is also entirely red within the canton. Its corresponding row vector in `A` is also `v_1 = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n    *   A row that does not cross the horizontal bar will pass through white pixels. This row will have 0s for the white pixels and 1s for the red pixels (the vertical part of the cross and the red field to the right of the canton). This gives a different row vector, `v_2`, which contains both 0s and 1s. For instance, it would look like `(0,...,0, 1,...,1, 0,...,0, 1,....,1)`.\n\nThe row space of `A` is the space spanned by the set of all its row vectors. In this case, every row is either of type `v_1` or `v_2`. The vectors `v_1` and `v_2` are linearly independent because `v_1` has no zero entries, while `v_2` does, so one cannot be a scalar multiple of the other.\n\nSince the row space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors, the rank of `A` is 2 for this choice of `a` and `b`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the rank of the matrix cannot exceed 2, and we have found a specific case where the rank is equal to 2. Therefore, the maximal possible rank is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
