The approach is not valid. The ecological function of a mimicry syndrome in bees is to provide a recognizable warning signal to their natural predators, which are primarily birds. The validity of the clustering method hinges on whether the judges of similarity are an appropriate proxy for these predators. Human undergraduates are not a valid proxy for several critical reasons:

1.  **Different Visual Systems:** The most significant flaw is the difference between human and avian vision. Humans have trichromatic vision and cannot see ultraviolet (UV) light. Many birds, key predators of bees, have tetrachromatic vision and can perceive UV light. Bee coloration often includes UV patterns that are invisible to humans. Therefore, two species that appear similar to a human may look distinctly different to a bird, and vice versa. This means human-based clustering may completely misrepresent the functional mimicry rings as perceived by predators.

2.  **Biased Stimuli:** The use of standard field images compounds this problem. Digital cameras are designed to capture light for human eyes and typically do not record the UV spectrum. The images themselves lack the full visual information that a predator would use to identify the bee.

3.  **Lack of Ecological Context:** Untrained undergraduates judge abstract visual similarity. A predator's perception is shaped by learning and experienceâ€”associating a specific pattern with a negative stimulus (a sting). Predators are selected to recognize a "danger" gestalt quickly, while a human looking at a photo may focus on fine details that are irrelevant to a predator making a split-second decision.

Because the method uses a signal receiver (human) that is not ecologically relevant and whose sensory capabilities are fundamentally different from the actual target of the signal (predator), the resulting clusters would not reliably reflect the functional mimicry syndromes.
