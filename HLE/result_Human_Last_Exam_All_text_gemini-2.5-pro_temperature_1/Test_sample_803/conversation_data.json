    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a \"filled group\".**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset S of a group G is product-free if for any two elements x, y in S (not necessarily distinct), their product xy is not in S. This implies that the identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set S, because if x is in S, then `ex = x` would have to not be in S, which is a contradiction.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set S is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G.\n*   **Fills G:** A subset S of G fills G if G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {e}, where S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}. This means every non-identity element of G is either in S or its inverse is in S (or both).\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group G is \"filled\" if *every* maximal product-free set in G fills G.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the key theorem about filled groups.**\n\nThis problem is greatly simplified by a known theorem from group theory (G.L. Walls, 1988):\n**Theorem:** A finite group G is filled if and only if G does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z_p × Z_p for any prime p.\n\nOur task is now transformed into finding all nonabelian groups G of order |G| = 2q^m that do not have any subgroup isomorphic to Z_p × Z_p.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"no Z_p × Z_p subgroup\" condition for G.**\n\nThe order of G is 2q^m. The only prime divisors of |G| are 2 and q. Therefore, we only need to check for subgroups isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2 and Z_q × Z_q.\n\n*   **Condition for p=2 (No Z_2 × Z_2 subgroup):**\n    A subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2 has order 4. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group G. The order of G is |G| = 2q^m. Since q is an odd prime, q^m is odd. Thus, |G| is divisible by 2 but not by 4. As a result, G cannot have a subgroup of order 4. This means G cannot contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 × Z_2. This condition is automatically satisfied for any group of order 2q^m.\n\n*   **Condition for p=q (No Z_q × Z_q subgroup):**\n    We need to ensure that G does not have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_q × Z_q. Let P be any Sylow q-subgroup of G. If G contains a subgroup K ≈ Z_q × Z_q, then K is a q-group, and by Sylow's theorems, K must be contained within some Sylow q-subgroup P of G. Therefore, the condition that G has no Z_q × Z_q subgroup is equivalent to the condition that its Sylow q-subgroups have no Z_q × Z_q subgroup.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Sylow q-subgroups.**\n\nLet P be a Sylow q-subgroup of G, with |P| = q^m. We require P to not contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z_q × Z_q. For a p-group (where p is any prime), having no Z_p × Z_p subgroup is equivalent to saying that every abelian subgroup is cyclic. For an odd prime q, a q-group has this property if and only if the group itself is cyclic.\n\n*   **Proof Sketch:** If a q-group P is non-cyclic, its Frattini quotient P/Φ(P) is an elementary abelian group of rank d ≥ 2, which means P requires at least two generators. It can be shown that this implies the existence of an abelian subgroup that is not cyclic, which in turn must contain a Z_q × Z_q subgroup.\n*   Therefore, the Sylow q-subgroup P of G must be cyclic. P ≅ Z_{q^m}.\n\n**Step 5: Classify the nonabelian groups of order 2q^m with a cyclic Sylow q-subgroup.**\n\nWe are now looking for nonabelian groups G of order 2q^m with a cyclic Sylow q-subgroup P ≅ Z_{q^m} and a Sylow 2-subgroup H ≅ Z_2.\n\n*   **Normality of the Sylow q-subgroup:** Let n_q be the number of Sylow q-subgroups. By Sylow's theorems, n_q must divide |G|/|P| = 2, so n_q ∈ {1, 2}. Also, n_q ≡ 1 (mod q). Since q is an odd prime (q ≥ 3), the congruence n_q ≡ 1 (mod q) cannot be satisfied by n_q = 2. Thus, n_q must be 1. This means the Sylow q-subgroup P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\n*   **Semidirect Product Structure:** Since P is a normal subgroup of G, and the orders of P and H are coprime (gcd(q^m, 2) = 1), the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem states that G is a split extension of P by H. That is, G is a semidirect product: G = P ⋊_φ H.\n\n*   **Determining the Homomorphism:** The structure of the semidirect product is determined by a homomorphism φ: H → Aut(P).\n    *   P ≅ Z_{q^m} = ⟨x | x^(q^m) = e⟩\n    *   H ≅ Z_2 = ⟨y | y² = e⟩\n    The homomorphism φ is determined by the image of the generator y, which must be an automorphism α = φ(y) of P. Since y² = e, we must have α² = φ(y)² = φ(y²) = φ(e) = id_P (the identity automorphism). So, α must be an automorphism of P with order 1 or 2.\n    The automorphism group of P is Aut(Z_{q^m}) ≅ (Z/q^m Z)*, which is a cyclic group of order φ(q^m) = q^(m-1)(q-1). Since q is odd, q-1 is even, so this group has even order. A cyclic group of even order has exactly one element of order 2.\n    The two possible choices for α are:\n    1.  α = id_P (the element of order 1).\n    2.  α is the unique element of order 2 in Aut(Z_{q^m}), which corresponds to the inversion map: α(z) = z⁻¹ for all z ∈ P. In terms of the generator x, α(x) = x⁻¹.\n\n*   **Constructing the Groups:**\n    1.  **Trivial Homomorphism (α = id_P):** If φ is the trivial homomorphism, the semidirect product becomes a direct product: G = P × H ≅ Z_{q^m} × Z_2. Since gcd(2, q^m) = 1, this group is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_{2q^m}. This is an abelian group, so it is not a solution.\n    2.  **Nontrivial Homomorphism (α(x) = x⁻¹):** If φ is nontrivial, the group G is defined by the relations from P and H, plus the action of H on P: yxy⁻¹ = α(x) = x⁻¹. The full presentation is:\n        G = ⟨x, y | x^(q^m) = e, y² = e, yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹⟩\n        This is the definition of the **dihedral group** of order 2q^m, denoted D_{2q^m}. This group is nonabelian because x ≠ x⁻¹ (since the order of x is q^m ≥ 3).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that for any odd prime q and natural number m, there is exactly one nonabelian group of order 2q^m that is a \"filled group\". This group is the dihedral group of that order.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups of order 2q^m.\n\n<<<The dihedral groups of order 2q^m, which have the presentation ⟨x, y | x^(q^m) = e, y² = e, yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹⟩.>>>"
