    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We look for a common factor among groups of terms.\nNotice that we can group terms as follows:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nFactoring out the common term $(x^2 - 2)$, we get:\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their Galois groups**\n\n*   **Analysis of g(x) = x² - 2:**\n    *   The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   The splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   The degree of this extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n    *   The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n*   **Analysis of h(x) = x⁵ - 9x + 3:**\n    *   **Irreducibility:** We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The prime $3$ divides the coefficients $-9$ and $3$, but $3$ does not divide the leading coefficient $1$, and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term $3$. Therefore, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Galois Group:** To determine the Galois group of this irreducible quintic, we find the number of real roots. We examine its derivative:\n        $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$.\n        The critical points are the roots of $h'(x)=0$, so $x^4 = 9/5$, which gives two real critical points $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n        Let's evaluate $h(x)$ at these points:\n        *   At $x_1 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$: $h(x_1) = x_1(x_1^4 - 9) + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = -\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3$. Since $\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > \\sqrt[4]{1}=1$, we have $h(x_1) < -36/5 + 3 = -7.2 + 3 = -4.2 < 0$. This is a local minimum.\n        *   At $x_2 = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$: $h(x_2) = x_2(x_2^4 - 9) + 3 = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 > 0$. This is a local maximum.\n    *   Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $h(x)$ must have exactly three real roots.\n    *   A standard theorem in Galois theory states that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly two non-real roots has the symmetric group $S_p$ as its Galois group. Here, $p=5$ and we have $5-3=2$ non-real roots. Thus, the Galois group of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $S_5$. Let $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$. Then $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, and the degree of the extension is $[K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K over Q**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum $K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) K_h$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The group $G$ is isomorphic to the direct product if and only if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe field $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension. The field $K_h$ contains a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ where $D$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$.\nFor $h(x)=x^5-9x+3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{5(4)/2}(5^5 \\cdot 3^{4} + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 1 \\cdot (3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049) = 3^4(5^5 - 4^4 \\cdot 9^3) = 81(3125 - 256 \\cdot 729) = 81(3125 - 186624) = 81(-183499)$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{81(-183499)}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-183499})$.\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-183499})$ is an imaginary quadratic field, they cannot be equal. Thus, their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nTherefore, $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] \\cdot [K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of intermediate normal extensions**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset L \\subset K$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subset H \\subset G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group), and $S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ can be of two types:\n1.  **Product subgroups:** $H_1 \\times H_2$, where $H_1 \\triangleleft G_1$ and $H_2 \\triangleleft G_2$.\n2.  **Diagonal subgroups:** These exist when there is a common quotient group between $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n\nLet's list the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$:\n\n*   **Product Type Subgroups:**\n    1.  $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H| = 2$. Index $[G:H] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    2.  $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H| = |A_5| = 60$. Index $[G:H] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    3.  $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H| = |S_5| = 120$. Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    4.  $C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H| = 2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n*   **Diagonal Type Subgroups:**\n    We look for an isomorphism $\\phi: N_1/K_1 \\to N_2/K_2$ where $K_1 \\triangleleft N_1 \\triangleleft C_2$ and $K_2 \\triangleleft N_2 \\triangleleft S_5$.\n    The only non-trivial common quotient group is $C_2$.\n    We have $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$ and $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$.\n    This gives rise to a normal subgroup $H_{diag} = \\{(g, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = g\\}$, where we identify $C_2$ with $\\{\\pm 1\\}$.\n    This subgroup consists of pairs $(1, \\alpha)$ where $\\alpha \\in A_5$ (even permutations) and $(-1, \\beta)$ where $\\beta \\in S_5 \\setminus A_5$ (odd permutations).\n    The order of this subgroup is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    The index is $[G:H_{diag}] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: List all possible degrees**\n\nThe possible orders of proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ are 2, 60, and 120.\nThe possible degrees of the corresponding normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of these subgroups:\n*   For $|H|=2$, the degree is $120$.\n*   For $|H|=60$, the degree is $4$.\n*   For $|H|=120$, the degree is $2$.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees for such extensions $L$ is therefore $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\nLet's identify these fields for clarity:\n*   **Degree 2:** There are three normal subgroups of index 2, corresponding to the three quadratic subfields of $K$: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-183499})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2 \\cdot 183499})$. All are normal over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Degree 4:** This corresponds to the fixed field of $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$, which is the biquadratic extension $K^{\\{e\\}\\times A_5} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-183499})$. This is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Degree 120:** This corresponds to the fixed field of $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, which is the splitting field $K_h$ of $h(x)$. Since $K_h$ is a splitting field, it is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its degree is 120.\n\nAll these degrees are possible.\n\nFinal list of possible degrees: 2, 4, 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
