    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the simplex category $\\Delta$ as a 2-category\n\nThe problem states that $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$. Let's break down what this means.\n1.  **Objects:** The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for non-negative integers $n$. These are viewed as posets with the standard ordering.\n2.  **1-morphisms:** A morphism (or 1-morphism) $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., a function such that for all $i, j \\in [m]$, if $i \\le j$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$.\n3.  **2-morphisms:** Since $\\Delta$ is a locally posetal 2-category, for any two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$, the collection of morphisms $\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m], [n])$ is a poset. The 2-morphisms are given by this partial order. For two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ (denoted $f \\Rightarrow g$) if and only if $f \\le g$. The order relation is the pointwise order: $f \\le g$ if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the definition of an internal adjunction in this context\n\nAn internal adjunction from an object $A$ to an object $B$ in a 2-category consists of a pair of 1-morphisms, a left adjoint $L: A \\to B$ and a right adjoint $R: B \\to A$, along with two 2-morphisms, the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$, satisfying certain coherence conditions (the triangle identities).\n\nIn our specific case, we are looking for an adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$, where $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n*   The left adjoint is a morphism $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n*   The right adjoint is a morphism $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n*   The unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ translates to the inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\le R \\circ L$. In pointwise terms, this means $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [23]$.\n*   The counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$ translates to the inequality $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$. In pointwise terms, this means $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [37]$.\n\nIn a poset-enriched category (like this one), the triangle identities are automatically satisfied. Therefore, an adjunction is simply a pair of order-preserving maps $(L, R)$ satisfying these two inequalities. This is also known as a **monotone Galois connection**.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps\n\nAn adjunction is determined by either the left adjoint or the right adjoint.\n*   An order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it has a right adjoint $R$. A map $L$ has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). In a finite total order like $[m]$, this is equivalent to preserving the minimum element, which is 0. Thus, $L$ must satisfy $L(0)=0$. If $L(0)=0$, its right adjoint $R$ is uniquely determined by the formula $R(j) = \\max \\{i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$. The condition $L(0)=0$ ensures that the set is non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$.\n*   An order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it has a left adjoint $L$. A map $R$ has a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). In a finite total order like $[n]$, this is equivalent to preserving the maximum element. Thus, $R$ must satisfy $R(n)=m$. If $R(n)=m$, its left adjoint $L$ is uniquely determined by the formula $L(i) = \\min \\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le R(j)\\}$. The condition $R(n)=m$ ensures that the set is non-empty for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\nSo, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoint maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$, which is also equal to the number of possible right adjoint maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of possible left adjoints\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy the condition $L(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $(L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23))$ such that $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $(L(1), \\dots, L(23))$ of length 23, where each element is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars or by counting combinations with repetition.\n\n**Method: Combinations with repetition**\nWe are choosing 23 values ($L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $37 - 0 + 1 = 38$ elements. Since the sequence is non-decreasing, the choices are not independent, but once a multiset of 23 values is chosen, there is only one way to arrange them in non-decreasing order. So, the problem is equivalent to choosing a multiset of size $k=23$ from a set of size $s=38$.\n\nThe formula for combinations with repetition is $\\binom{s+k-1}{k}$.\nPlugging in our values, $s=38$ and $k=23$:\nNumber of maps = $\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**Alternative Method: Stars and Bars**\nLet the sequence be $y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_{23}$, where $y_i = L(i)$. We have $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_{23} \\le 37$.\nLet's define a new sequence of strictly increasing integers:\n$x_i = y_i + i$ for $i=1, \\dots, 23$.\n1.  $y_1 \\ge 0 \\implies x_1 = y_1+1 \\ge 1$.\n2.  $y_i \\le y_{i+1} \\implies y_i+i < y_{i+1}+i+1 \\implies x_i < x_{i+1}$.\n3.  $y_{23} \\le 37 \\implies x_{23} = y_{23}+23 \\le 37+23 = 60$.\n\nSo we have a strictly increasing sequence $1 \\le x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_{23} \\le 60$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing 23 distinct numbers from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 60\\}$.\nThe number of ways to do this is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. We can also verify this by counting the right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$ satisfying $R(37)=23$. This would require counting non-decreasing sequences $(R(0), \\dots, R(36))$ from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$, which results in $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\n$\\binom{60}{23}$\n>>>"
