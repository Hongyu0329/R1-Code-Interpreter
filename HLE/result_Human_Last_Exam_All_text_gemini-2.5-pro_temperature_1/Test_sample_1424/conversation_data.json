    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Green's function, or propagator, is a fundamental quantity that describes the propagation of a particle from one spacetime point to another. In the context of a \"bare\" Green's function ($G_0$), we are considering a non-interacting system.\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, physical quantities are calculated as expectation values over all possible field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the action. For fermionic fields ($\\psi, \\bar{\\psi}$), the bare Green's function is defined as the two-point correlation function:\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\langle T[\\psi(x,t) \\bar{\\psi}(x',t')] \\rangle_0$\n\nHere, $T$ is the time-ordering operator, and the expectation value $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ is calculated using the path integral for the non-interacting action, $S_0$.\n\n**2. The Action for a Non-Interacting System ($S_0$)**\n\nThe path integral's weight is determined by the action. For a non-interacting system, the action $S_0$ is given by:\n\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\, d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x,t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0 \\right) \\psi(x,t)$\n\nwhere $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian of the system. The crucial point is that the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator, $H_0$.\n\n**3. Diagonalizing the Action using the Energy Eigenbasis**\n\nTo see the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ explicitly, we move from the position basis $(x)$ to the energy eigenbasis $(k)$. The eigenstates of $H_0$ are denoted by $|k\\rangle$ with corresponding eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | k \\rangle$ and eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$, such that $H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$.\n\nWe expand the Grassmann field $\\psi(x,t)$ in this basis:\n$\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(x) \\psi_k(t)$\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions ($\\int d^d x \\, \\phi_{k'}^*(x) \\phi_k(x) = \\delta_{k'k}$) and the eigenvalue equation, the action simplifies and decouples:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, \\bar{\\psi}_k(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) \\psi_k(t)$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** This diagonalization is the key step. It shows that the full action is just a sum of independent actions for each mode $k$. The dynamics of each mode depends only on its specific single-particle energy, $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n**4. Relating the Green's Function to the Inverse of the Action's Operator**\n\nFor a quadratic action like $S_0$, the Green's function is the inverse of the operator that appears between $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$. For the mode $k$, this operator is $\\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right)$.\n\nTo find the inverse, it is easiest to Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$). Under this transformation (and setting $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity):\n$i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\omega$\n\nSo, the operator in frequency space becomes $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nThe Green's function for the mode $k$ in frequency space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is therefore the inverse of this algebraic expression:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$\n\n**5. Incorporating the Feynman Boundary Conditions (The $i\\eta$ prescription)**\n\nThe simple inverse $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$ has a pole on the real axis, which is ambiguous. The time-ordering $T$ in the definition of the Green's function resolves this ambiguity. It ensures that particles (states with $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential) propagate forward in time, and holes (states with $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$) propagate backward in time.\n\nIn the frequency domain, this physical requirement is implemented by adding a small imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. This shifts the pole slightly off the real axis.\n\n*   For **particle states** ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$), the pole is shifted to $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - i\\eta$.\n*   For **hole states** ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$), the pole is shifted to $\\omega = \\epsilon_k + i\\eta$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This prescription is not arbitrary; it is a direct mathematical consequence of enforcing the time-ordering required for the Feynman propagator.\n\nThis leads to the final expression for the bare Green's function.\n\n### Final Functional Dependence\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is most transparent in the frequency-momentum representation $(k, \\omega)$. The Green's function for a given mode $k$ is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for mode $k$.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential (defining the Fermi level).\n*   $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal.\n*   $\\text{sgn}$ is the sign function.\n\n**In summary, the functional dependence is that of a simple inverse:** $G_0$ has a simple pole in the complex frequency plane. **The real part of the pole's location is precisely the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.** The imaginary part of the pole's location, determined by whether $\\epsilon_k$ is above or below the chemical potential, dictates the causal propagation of the particle or hole.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ as a simple pole, expressed by the formula $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$. The real part of the pole in the complex $\\omega$-plane is located at the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
