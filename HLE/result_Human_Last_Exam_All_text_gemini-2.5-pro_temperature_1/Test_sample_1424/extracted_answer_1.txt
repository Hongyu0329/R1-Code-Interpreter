The bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ as a simple pole, expressed by the formula $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta \, \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - \mu)}$. The real part of the pole in the complex $\omega$-plane is located at the energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$.
