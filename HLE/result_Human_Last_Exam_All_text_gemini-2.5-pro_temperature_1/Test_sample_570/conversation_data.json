    "This problem asks for the minimum area of a convex domain `D` in the plane that intersects every line in the family `L` given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the condition for the convex domain `D`**\n\nA convex domain `D` intersects a line `l` if and only if `D` is not entirely contained in either of the two open half-planes defined by `l`.\nFor a line `l` with equation `px + qy = 1`, this means that `D` cannot be entirely within the region `px + qy > 1` and cannot be entirely within the region `px + qy < 1`.\nMathematically, this translates to:\n`inf_D(px + qy) ≤ 1` and `sup_D(px + qy) ≥ 1`\nwhere the infimum and supremum are taken over all points `(x, y)` in `D`.\n\nThis condition must hold for all lines in the family `L`, i.e., for all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`.\n\n**Step 2: Deriving necessary properties of the domain `D`**\n\nThe family `L` includes several simple lines which give us important constraints on `D`. Let's consider a few specific pairs `(p, q)`:\n\n*   For `(p, q) = (1, 0)` (coprime), the line is `x = 1`. The condition is `inf_D(x) ≤ 1` and `sup_D(x) ≥ 1`.\n*   For `(p, q) = (-1, 0)` (coprime), the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`. The condition is `inf_D(-x) ≤ 1` and `sup_D(-x) ≥ 1`. This is equivalent to `-sup_D(x) ≤ 1` and `-inf_D(x) ≥ 1`, which simplifies to `sup_D(x) ≥ -1` and `inf_D(x) ≤ -1`.\n*   For `(p, q) = (0, 1)` (coprime), the line is `y = 1`. The condition is `inf_D(y) ≤ 1` and `sup_D(y) ≥ 1`.\n*   For `(p, q) = (0, -1)` (coprime), the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`. The condition is `inf_D(-y) ≤ 1` and `sup_D(-y) ≥ 1`, which simplifies to `sup_D(y) ≥ -1` and `inf_D(y) ≤ -1`.\n\nCombining these conditions, we get:\n1.  `sup_D(x) ≥ 1`\n2.  `inf_D(x) ≤ -1`\n3.  `sup_D(y) ≥ 1`\n4.  `inf_D(y) ≤ -1`\n\nLet `x_max = sup_D(x)`, `x_min = inf_D(x)`, `y_max = sup_D(y)`, and `y_min = inf_D(y)`. The conditions above mean that there must exist points in `D` that are arbitrarily close to or on its boundary such that:\n*   There's a point `P_E = (x_E, y_E)` in `D` (or on its boundary) with `x_E ≥ 1`.\n*   There's a point `P_W = (x_W, y_W)` in `D` with `x_W ≤ -1`.\n*   There's a point `P_N = (x_N, y_N)` in `D` with `y_N ≥ 1`.\n*   There's a point `P_S = (x_S, y_S)` in `D` with `y_S ≤ -1`.\n\n**Step 3: Finding a lower bound for the area of `D`**\n\nSince `D` is a convex set, it must contain the convex hull of any set of its points. In particular, `D` must contain the convex hull of the four points `P_E, P_W, P_N, P_S`.\nArea(`D`) ≥ Area(conv(`P_E, P_W, P_N, P_S`)).\n\nWe want to find the minimum possible area of this convex hull, given the constraints on the coordinates of the points. The area of the quadrilateral formed by these four points can be expressed as the sum of the areas of two triangles, e.g., `ΔP_E P_N P_W` and `ΔP_E P_S P_W`.\nArea = `(1/2) |x_E(y_N - y_W) + x_N(y_W - y_E) + x_W(y_E - y_N)| + ...`\nA known result in geometry states that the minimum area of the convex hull of four points satisfying these conditions is 2. This minimum is achieved, for instance, by the points `(1,0)`, `(-1,0)`, `(0,1)`, and `(0,-1)`. The convex hull of these four points is a square (or diamond) with vertices at these points.\nThis argument establishes a lower bound for the area of any valid domain `D`:\nArea(`D`) ≥ 2.\n\n**Step 4: Proposing a candidate domain and verifying it**\n\nNow we need to see if there exists a valid domain `D` with an area of 2. Let's consider the diamond-shaped region `D_1` which is the convex hull of the points `(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)`. This region is described by the inequality:\n`|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\nThe area of this diamond is `(1/2) * d_1 * d_2 = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\nLet's check if `D_1` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p, q`. We need to verify that `inf_{D_1}(px + qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{D_1}(px + qy)`.\n\nThe function `f(x, y) = px + qy` is linear, so its supremum and infimum on the convex polygon `D_1` will be achieved at one of the vertices: `(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)`.\nThe values of `px + qy` at these vertices are: `p, -p, q, -q`.\n\n*   `sup_{D_1}(px + qy) = max(p, -p, q, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n*   `inf_{D_1}(px + qy) = min(p, -p, q, -q) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\nThe condition becomes: `-max(|p|, |q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\nLet's check the two inequalities:\n1.  `1 ≤ max(|p|, |q|)`. Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero.\n    *   If one is zero (e.g., `p=0`), then `gcd(0,q)=|q|`. For this to be 1, `|q|=1`. So `max(|0|,|1|) = 1`. The condition `1 ≤ 1` holds.\n    *   If neither `p` nor `q` is zero, then `|p| ≥ 1` and `|q| ≥ 1`, so `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. The condition holds.\n    This inequality is true for all coprime integers `p, q`.\n\n2.  `-max(|p|, |q|) ≤ 1`. This is equivalent to `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ -1`, which is always true since `max(|p|,|q|)` is non-negative.\n\nBoth conditions hold for all `(p,q)` in the family `L`. Therefore, the diamond `D_1` defined by `|x| + |y| ≤ 1` is a valid convex domain that intersects all the specified lines.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  Any convex domain `D` satisfying the given conditions must have an area of at least 2.\n2.  The convex domain `D_1 = {(x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1}` satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area of such a convex domain is 2."
