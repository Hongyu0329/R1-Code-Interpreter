    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set of numbers $E$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if it satisfies the following property: for any four elements $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in E$, the equality $x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$ implies that the set of summands on both sides is the same, i.e., $\\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{x_3, x_4\\}$ as multisets. This means, after possibly reordering, either $x_1=x_3$ and $x_2=x_4$, or $x_1=x_4$ and $x_2=x_3$. The definition applies to subsets of any additive group, in this case, the real numbers $(\\mathbb{R}, +)$. We are interested in Sidon sets $E \\subset [0, 1]$.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(F)$, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set $F$. It generalizes the familiar notion of dimension (0 for points, 1 for lines, 2 for surfaces, etc.) to more complex sets.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible value of $\\dim_H(E)$ for any set $E \\subset [0, 1]$ that is a Sidon set.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Dimension\n\nThis is a problem in the field of geometric measure theory, and it can be solved using Fourier analysis. The argument to show that the dimension must be less than or equal to $1/2$ is quite technical. Here is a sketch of the proof, following the work of D. Oberlin (2017).\n\n1.  **Assume a dimension greater than 1/2:** Let's assume there exists a Sidon set $E \\subset [0, 1]$ with Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(E) = s > 1/2$.\n\n2.  **Use Frostman's Lemma:** By Frostman's Lemma, if a set $E$ has Hausdorff dimension $s$, then for any $s' < s$, there exists a non-zero, finite Borel measure $\\mu$ supported on $E$ such that for any ball (interval) $B(x, r)$ of radius $r$, we have $\\mu(B(x, r)) \\le C r^{s'}$. This measure can be chosen to be a probability measure and to be continuous (atomless) if $s' > 0$. We choose $s'$ such that $1/2 < s' < s$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Fourier Transform:** Let $\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi) = \\int e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} d\\mu(x)$ be the Fourier transform of the measure $\\mu$. The condition on $\\mu$ (from Frostman's Lemma) implies that its $s'$-energy integral is finite, which in turn implies that its Fourier transform decays at a certain rate. Specifically, one can show that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |\\xi|^{s'-1} |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^2 d\\xi < \\infty$.\n\n4.  **Use the Sidon Property:** The Sidon property of the set $E$ (the support of $\\mu$) imposes a strong constraint on the fourth moment of the Fourier transform. For a continuous probability measure $\\mu$ on a Sidon set, one can prove that:\n    $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^4 d\\xi = 2$.\n    This comes from relating the integral to the number of solutions to $x_1 + x_2 - x_3 - x_4 = 0$ in $E$, which the Sidon property restricts to \"trivial\" solutions.\n\n5.  **Derive a Contradiction:** The core of the proof is to show that the two conditions derived above are contradictory.\n    *   The condition $\\int |\\xi|^{s'-1} |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^2 d\\xi < \\infty$ with $s' > 1/2$ can be shown to imply that the function $g(\\xi) = |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^2$ belongs to the Lebesgue space $L^p(\\mathbb{R})$ for some exponent $p > 2$.\n    *   Since $p>2$ and $g$ is also in $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$ (as $\\int g(\\xi) d\\xi = \\int |\\hat{\\mu}|^2 d\\xi = \\int d\\mu = 1$), by interpolation, $g$ must also be in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n    *   So, we must have $\\int g(\\xi)^2 d\\xi = \\int |\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi)|^4 d\\xi < \\infty$. This is consistent with the value 2 we found earlier.\n    *   However, a theorem from Fourier analysis (due to Wiener and Lukacs) states that if the Fourier transform of a measure $\\nu$ is in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, then the measure $\\nu$ must be absolutely continuous with an $L^2$ density function. Here, $g = |\\hat{\\mu}|^2$ is the Fourier transform of the measure $\\nu = \\mu * \\check{\\mu}$ (convolution of $\\mu$ with its reflection).\n    *   The final step of the argument is to show that the convolution of a Frostman measure $\\mu$ (supported on a set of dimension $s'<1$) cannot be a measure with an $L^2$ density if the Sidon property holds. This provides the contradiction.\n\nThe conclusion of this line of reasoning is that our initial assumption must be false. Therefore, there can be no Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1/2.\nSo, $\\dim_H(E) \\le 1/2$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound for the Dimension (Sharpness)\n\nTo show that $1/2$ is the *maximum* possible dimension, we need to show that this upper bound can be achieved. This requires constructing a Sidon set in $[0,1]$ that has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly $1/2$.\n\nSuch constructions exist in the mathematical literature.\n*   **J.-P. Kahane (1993):** Used a probabilistic method (random series) to show the existence of such sets.\n*   **Ł. Paśniczek (2018):** Provided a simpler, explicit construction of a compact Sidon set in $[0,1]$ with Hausdorff dimension 1/2.\n\nThese constructions are generally non-trivial. For instance, they can be built as special kinds of Cantor sets where the geometry is carefully controlled to satisfy the Sidon condition while maintaining a dimension of 1/2. The existence of these sets proves that the maximum dimension is at least 1/2.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set $E \\subset [0, 1]$ cannot exceed $1/2$.\nFrom Step 3, we know that there exist Sidon sets in $[0, 1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly $1/2$.\nCombining these two facts, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is $1/2$."
