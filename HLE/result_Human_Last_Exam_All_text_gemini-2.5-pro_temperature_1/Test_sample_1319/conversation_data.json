    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe goal is to find the tallest *historical* (real-world) mountain mentioned in the *Iliad*, with the specific exclusion of Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Mount Olympus**\nMount Olympus is the most famous mountain in the Iliad, serving as the home of the gods. It is a real mountain in Greece and the country's highest, at approximately 2,918 meters (9,573 ft). As per the question, we must exclude it from our final ranking.\n\n**Step 3: List Other Historical Mountains Mentioned in the Iliad**\nWe must scan the epic for other named mountains that correspond to real geographical locations. The key candidates are:\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** Very prominent in the story. It is a mountain range in modern-day Turkey overlooking the site of Troy. Zeus, Hera, and other gods frequent its peaks, particularly the highest point, named **Gargarus**, to watch the war.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in Book 2 (the \"Catalogue of Ships\") as the location of the Meionians, allies of the Trojans. It is a real mountain in ancient Lydia, now known as Bozdağ in Turkey.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned in Book 14 when the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Ida. She steps on various peaks, including Mount Athos. It is a real mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned in Book 16 and elsewhere as the source of the famously strong ash-wood spear that Chiron the centaur gave to Peleus, who then gave it to his son, Achilles. It is a real mountain in Thessaly, Greece.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (or Saos):** Mentioned in Book 13 as the vantage point from which the god Poseidon secretly watches the battle, seated on its highest peak. Samothrace is a real Greek island, and its highest point is Mount Fengari (or Saos).\n\n**Step 4: Find the Real-World Elevations of These Mountains**\nTo determine which is the tallest, we need to compare their modern-day elevations:\n\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ):** approx. 2,157 meters (7,077 ft)\n*   **Mount Athos:** approx. 2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağları):** approx. 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** approx. 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** approx. 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Select the Tallest**\nBy comparing the elevations of the mountains identified in Step 4, we can rank them from tallest to shortest:\n1.  **Mount Tmolus** (2,157 m)\n2.  Mount Athos (2,033 m)\n3.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n4.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n5.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n\nThe tallest among these is Mount Tmolus.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The question requires a \"historical\" mountain, meaning it must be a real place, which all the candidates are.\n*   The mountain must be explicitly \"mentioned in the Iliad.\" While other mountains are important in Greek mythology (like Mount Parnassus or Mount Cithaeron), they do not feature by name in the Iliad.\n*   Though Mount Ida is far more central to the plot of the Iliad than Mount Tmolus, the question is about physical height, not narrative importance.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the analysis, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
