    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the conductor N**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet character**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$\nwhere $\\chi_1$ is a character mod $2^2=4$, $\\chi_2$ is a character mod $3^2=9$, $\\chi_3$ is a character mod $7$, $\\chi_4$ is a character mod $11$, and $\\chi_5$ is a character mod $13$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character with conductor equal to its corresponding prime power factor.\n*   $\\chi_1$ must be a primitive character of conductor 4.\n*   $\\chi_2$ must be a primitive character of conductor 9.\n*   $\\chi_3$ must be a primitive character of conductor 7.\n*   $\\chi_4$ must be a primitive character of conductor 11.\n*   $\\chi_5$ must be a primitive character of conductor 13.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the order of the character**\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6. This imposes two conditions on the orders of the component characters, $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$:\n1.  Each $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5\\}$ must contain an order divisible by 2 and an order divisible by 3.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of choices for each component character**\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each conductor $p^a$ whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($=2^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 4, $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There are two characters: the principal character (order 1, conductor 1) and one non-principal character (order 2, conductor 4). The latter is the only primitive character. Its order is 2, which divides 6.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: 1. (Order is 2).\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($=3^2$)**: The group of characters mod 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The non-primitive characters are induced from mod 3 and have orders 1 and 2. The primitive characters are the remaining ones. Their orders must be divisors of 6 other than 1 and 2, which means their orders must be 3 or 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 2+2=4$. Both orders 3 and 6 divide 6.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_2$: 4. (Orders are 3 or 6).\n\n*   **Conductor 7**: The group of characters mod 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character is primitive if it is not the principal character (order 1). The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 6 other than 1, i.e., 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$. All these orders divide 6.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_3$: 5. (Orders are 2, 3, or 6).\n\n*   **Conductor 11**: The group of characters mod 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 10 other than 1, i.e., 2, 5, and 10. For the order to divide 6, it must be 2. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1. (Order is 2).\n\n*   **Conductor 13**: The group of characters mod 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The orders of primitive characters are divisors of 12 other than 1. We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_5$: 5. (Orders are 2, 3, or 6).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of characters and verify the order**\nThe total number of ways to choose the tuple of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$ satisfying the order divisibility condition is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that for every such combination, the lcm of the orders is exactly 6. Let $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$.\n*   $o_1 = 2$\n*   $o_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_4 = 2$\n*   $o_5 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe lcm of these orders must be divisible by 2, because $o_1=2$.\nThe lcm of these orders must be divisible by 3, because $o_2$ is always 3 or 6.\nSince the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nFurthermore, since each $o_i$ is a divisor of 6, their lcm cannot be greater than 6.\nTherefore, the lcm of the orders is exactly 6 for every one of the 100 combinations.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$ is 100."
