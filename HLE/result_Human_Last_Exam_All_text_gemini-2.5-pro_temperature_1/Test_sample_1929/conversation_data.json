    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and the Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene**\n    *   The common name for 1,3-butadiene.\n    *   Structure: CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂\n    *   This is a conjugated diene, a molecule with two double bonds separated by a single bond. It can provide 4 π-electrons for a reaction.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**\n    *   Structure: CCl₂=CF₂\n    *   This is an alkene (a molecule with a C=C double bond). It can provide 2 π-electrons for a reaction. Such a reactant is called a dienophile.\n\n*   **Reaction Type: Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring is known as the Diels-Alder reaction. It is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction is generally favored when the dienophile has electron-withdrawing groups. In CCl₂=CF₂, both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) are highly electronegative atoms, making them strong electron-withdrawing groups. This makes 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene a very reactive dienophile.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction Mechanism and Product Formation**\n\n*   **Conformation of the Diene:** For the Diels-Alder reaction to occur, the diene must be in the *s-cis* conformation (where the two double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond). 1,3-butadiene can easily rotate around its central C-C single bond to adopt this required conformation.\n\n*   **Electron Movement (Mechanism):** The reaction occurs in a single, concerted step through a cyclic transition state. Three pairs of electrons move simultaneously:\n    1.  The two π-electrons from one double bond of the diene (C1=C2) attack one of the carbons of the dienophile.\n    2.  The two π-electrons from the dienophile's double bond attack the other terminal carbon of the diene (C4).\n    3.  The two π-electrons from the second double bond of the diene (C3=C4) shift to form a new double bond between C2 and C3.\n\n*   **Bond Changes:**\n    *   **Bonds Formed:** Two new single (sigma) bonds and one new double (pi) bond.\n    *   **Bonds Broken:** Three double (pi) bonds (two from the diene, one from the dienophile).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\n1.  Start with the backbones of the reactants arranged for reaction:\n    *   Diene (s-cis): `CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂`\n    *   Dienophile: `CCl₂=CF₂`\n2.  Connect the ends of the diene to the carbons of the dienophile's double bond to form a six-membered ring.\n    *   The `-CH=CH-` part of the diene becomes the new double bond in the ring.\n    *   The two `CH₂` groups of the diene become saturated `CH₂` groups in the ring.\n    *   The `CCl₂=CF₂` becomes a `-CCl₂-CF₂-` segment in the ring.\n3.  The resulting structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents. The atoms from the diene form the `-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-` portion, and the atoms from the dienophile form the `-CF₂-CCl₂-` portion.\n\n    The structure of the product is:\n    ```\n           CH=CH\n          /     \\\n       H₂C       CH₂\n        \\       /\n         C(F₂) - C(Cl₂)\n    ```\n\n**4. Consider Regiochemistry and Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Regiochemistry:** This refers to the orientation of the addition. The dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) is unsymmetrical, but the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical. Because the diene is symmetrical, there is only one possible way for the dienophile to add. Adding CCl₂ to C1 and CF₂ to C4 of the diene gives the same product as adding CF₂ to C1 and CCl₂ to C4 (the molecules are superimposable by rotation). Therefore, only one constitutional isomer is formed.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, but in this case, no chiral centers are created. The carbons bearing the halogen atoms are bonded to two identical atoms each (`-CCl₂-` and `-CF₂-`), and the other carbons in the ring are either part of a double bond or are `CH₂` groups. Thus, the product is achiral, and there are no stereoisomers to consider.\n\n**5. Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature)**\n\n1.  **Parent Chain:** The core structure is a six-membered ring with one double bond, which is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbons of the double bond must be numbered C1 and C2. We then number around the ring in the direction that gives the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers).\n    *   Regardless of whether we number the double bond carbons 1,2 or 2,1, the substituted carbons will be at positions 4 and 5. The locant set is {4, 4, 5, 5}.\n3.  **Naming Substituents:** The substituents are two chlorine atoms (dichloro) and two fluorine atoms (difluoro).\n4.  **Alphabetical Order:** We list the substituents alphabetically. \"Dichloro\" comes before \"difluoro\".\n5.  **Assigning Locants:** When there is a choice, the alphabetically prior substituent gets the lower number. Here, the locant set {4,4,5,5} is fixed. We assign the lower number (4) to the alphabetically prior group (dichloro).\n6.  **Final Name:** The CCl₂ group is at position 4, and the CF₂ group is at position 5. The full name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**. (The \"-1-\" in cyclohex-1-ene is often omitted as it is unambiguous).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe product of the reaction is a six-membered ring formed via a [4+2] cycloaddition. The systematic IUPAC name for this product is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
