    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* in the specified performance.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Ballet:** *Swan Lake*\n*   **Production:** 2014 Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Specific Section:** Act II, Odette's variation\n*   **Specific Step:** *Sissone ferme*\n\n### **Step 2: Identify and Locate the Correct Performance**\nThe question refers to a specific, well-known recording. While the premiere of this revived production was in 2001, the widely available video recording featuring Svetlana Zakharova and Denis Rodkin was filmed at the Bolshoi Theatre in January 2015 and is often referenced as the \"2014/2015\" production. This is the definitive performance for answering the question. The next step is to locate Odette's solo variation within Act II of this recording.\n\n### **Step 3: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Ferme***\nTo count the step accurately, we must first understand what it is.\n*   **Sissone:** A type of jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Ferme:** French for \"closed.\"\n*   **Sissone Ferme:** A jump from two feet in fifth position, traveling in a direction (forward, sideways, or backward), landing on one foot in *demi-plié*, with the second foot quickly sliding to join the first in fifth position *demi-plié*. It is a sharp, quick, connecting jump. In Odette's variation, this step is performed traveling forward (*en avant*).\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Choreography of Odette's Variation**\nNow, we must watch the variation performed by Zakharova in the specified Grigorovich production and count only the *sissone fermes*.\n\n1.  The variation begins with slow, expressive movements, including *développés à la seconde* and *attitudes*.\n2.  Following the opening section, Odette begins a diagonal sequence traveling from upstage towards downstage.\n3.  This sequence is composed of the *sissone fermes*. Let's count them:\n    *   She prepares and executes the first **sissone ferme en avant**.\n    *   She immediately follows with a second **sissone ferme en avant**.\n    *   A third **sissone ferme en avant** is performed.\n    *   A fourth and final **sissone ferme en avant** completes the phrase.\n4.  After these four jumps, the choreography transitions into a different phrase involving a *piqué* turn and other steps.\n5.  Watching the remainder of the variation confirms that this is the only sequence of *sissone fermes*. The rest of the solo consists of other adagio steps, turns, and *pas de bourrées*.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Correct Production:** It is crucial to analyze the Grigorovich choreography, as other versions (like the classic Petipa/Ivanov or the Royal Ballet's staging) may have different choreography and a different step count for this variation.\n*   **Accurate Step Identification:** One must be careful not to misidentify the step. A *sissone ferme* is distinct from a *temps levé* (a hop on one foot) or a *jeté* (a jump from one foot to the other). The takeoff from two feet is the key identifier.\n*   **Thoroughness:** The entire variation must be reviewed to ensure no other instances of the step appear outside of the main, recognizable sequence.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nBased on a detailed analysis of the choreography performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the 2014/2015 Bolshoi Theatre recording of Yuri Grigorovich's *Swan Lake*, she performs a single diagonal sequence containing exactly four *sissone fermes* in her Act II Odette variation.\n\n<<<4>>>"
