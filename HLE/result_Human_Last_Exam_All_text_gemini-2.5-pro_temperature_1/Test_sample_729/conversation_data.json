    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Group and Power Subgroups**\n\n*   **Group (G):** The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, which we denote as Q_128.\n*   **Presentation of Q_128:** The generalized quaternion group Q_{4n} is defined by the presentation  `<x, y | x^(2n) = 1, x^n = y^2, y^(-1)xy = x^(-1)>`. For Q_128, the order is 128, so 4n = 128, which gives n = 32. Thus, the presentation for Q_128 is:\n    G = Q_128 = `<x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, y^(-1)xy = x^(-1)>`\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup H of a group G is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer `m` such that H is the set of all `m`-th powers of elements of G. This set is denoted by G^m = `{g^m | g ∈ G}`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Set of Power Subgroups**\n\nTo find all possible power subgroups, we need to calculate G^m for various integers `m`. A key theorem simplifies this process:\n\n*   **Theorem:** For any finite group G, the set of power subgroups is given by `{G^d | d divides exp(G)}`, where `exp(G)` is the exponent of the group G. The exponent is the smallest positive integer `k` such that `g^k = 1` for all `g` in G. Moreover, for any integer `m`, `G^m = G^d` where `d = gcd(m, exp(G))`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Exponent of Q_128**\n\nThe exponent of a group is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all its elements.\n*   The elements of Q_128 are of the form `x^i` (for `0 ≤ i < 64`) or `x^i y` (for `0 ≤ i < 64`).\n*   The order of the element `x` is 64. The subgroup `<x>` contains elements of orders that are divisors of 64 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64).\n*   Let's find the order of an element of the form `g = x^i y`:\n    `g^2 = (x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i (y x^i y^(-1)) y^2 = x^i (x^(-i)) y^2 = y^2 = x^32`.\n    `g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^32)^2 = x^64 = 1`.\n    So, every element of the form `x^i y` has order 4.\n*   The set of all element orders in Q_128 is `{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}`.\n*   The exponent is `exp(Q_128) = lcm(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64) = 64`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate G^d for each divisor `d` of the exponent**\n\nSince `exp(Q_128) = 64 = 2^6`, we need to find the distinct subgroups `G^d` where `d` is a divisor of 64. The divisors of 64 are {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}.\n\n1.  **d = 1:**\n    `G^1 = {g^1 | g ∈ G} = G = Q_128`. The order is 128.\n\n2.  **d = 2:**\n    `G^2 = {g^2 | g ∈ G}`.\n    - If `g = x^i`, `g^2 = x^(2i)`. This generates the cyclic subgroup `<x^2>`.\n    - If `g = x^i y`, `g^2 = x^32`.\n    So, `G^2 = <x^2> ∪ {x^32}`. Since `x^32 = (x^2)^16`, the element `x^32` is already in `<x^2>`.\n    Thus, `G^2 = <x^2>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order `64/2 = 32`.\n\n3.  **d = 4:**\n    `G^4 = {g^4 | g ∈ G}`.\n    - If `g = x^i`, `g^4 = x^(4i)`. This generates the cyclic subgroup `<x^4>`.\n    - If `g = x^i y`, `g^4 = 1` (since `ord(x^i y) = 4`).\n    So, `G^4 = <x^4> ∪ {1} = <x^4>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order `64/4 = 16`.\n\n4.  **d = 8:**\n    `G^8 = {g^8 | g ∈ G}`.\n    - If `g = x^i`, `g^8 = x^(8i)`. This generates `<x^8>`.\n    - If `g = x^i y`, `g^8 = (g^4)^2 = 1^2 = 1`.\n    So, `G^8 = <x^8>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order `64/8 = 8`.\n\n5.  **d = 16:**\n    `G^16 = <x^16>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order `64/16 = 4`.\n\n6.  **d = 32:**\n    `G^32 = <x^32>`. This is a cyclic subgroup of order `64/32 = 2`.\n\n7.  **d = 64:**\n    `G^64 = {g^64 | g ∈ G}`. Since the exponent is 64, `g^64 = 1` for all `g`.\n    `G^64 = {1}`. This is the trivial subgroup of order 1.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nWe have found the following set of power subgroups:\n*   `G^1 = Q_128` (order 128)\n*   `G^2 = <x^2>` (order 32)\n*   `G^4 = <x^4>` (order 16)\n*   `G^8 = <x^8>` (order 8)\n*   `G^16 = <x^16>` (order 4)\n*   `G^32 = <x^32>` (order 2)\n*   `G^64 = {1}` (order 1)\n\nSince all these subgroups have different orders, they are all distinct. Therefore, there are 7 distinct power subgroups.\n\nThe number of power subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of the exponent of the group. The exponent is 64 = 2^6. The number of divisors is 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n>>>7"
