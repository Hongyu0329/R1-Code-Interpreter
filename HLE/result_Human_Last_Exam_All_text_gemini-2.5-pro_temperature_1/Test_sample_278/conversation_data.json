    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand and visualize the parametric curve**\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$:\n    $x = \\cos t$\n    $y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$)\n    This is the standard parametrization of the upper half of a unit circle, as $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$ and for this range of $t$, $y = \\sin t \\ge 0$. The points range from $(1,0)$ at $t=0$ to $(-1,0)$ at $t=\\pi$.\n\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$:\n    $x = \\cos t$\n    $y = 5\\sin t$ (since $b=5$)\n    This gives the equation $(\\frac{x}{1})^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is an ellipse with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5. For this range of $t$, $y=5\\sin t < 0$, so this is the lower half of the ellipse. The points range from $(-1,0)$ as $t \\to \\pi$ to $(1,0)$ as $t \\to 2\\pi$.\n\nThe complete figure is a closed curve formed by joining the upper semi-circle of radius 1 with the lower semi-ellipse of semi-axes 1 and 5.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the problem formulation**\n\nThe area of the smallest square that encloses the figure is determined by the \"width\" of the figure in different directions. A common mistake is to use the axis-aligned bounding box, but a figure can be wider in a rotated frame than its axis-aligned dimensions suggest. The correct method is to use the concept of the width function of the convex hull of the figure.\n\nThe side length, $s$, of the smallest enclosing square is given by:\n$s = \\min_{\\alpha} \\max( W(\\alpha), W(\\alpha + \\pi/2) )$\nwhere $W(\\alpha)$ is the width of the figure in the direction of the angle $\\alpha$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the width function $W(\\alpha)$**\n\nThe width of a convex figure $F$ in the direction of a unit vector $u = (\\cos\\alpha, \\sin\\alpha)$ is given by:\n$W(\\alpha) = \\max_{p \\in F} (p \\cdot u) - \\min_{p \\in F} (p \\cdot u)$\nwhere $p=(x,y)$ is a point in the figure. We need to find the maximum and minimum values of the expression $f(x,y) = x\\cos\\alpha + y\\sin\\alpha$ for all points $(x,y)$ on the figure.\n\nSince $f(x,y)$ is a linear function and the figure is a convex set, the maximum and minimum values will occur on its boundary. The boundary consists of two parts: the upper semi-circle and the lower semi-ellipse.\n\n*   **On the upper semi-circle ($x=\\cos t, y=\\sin t$):**\n    $f(t) = \\cos t \\cos\\alpha + \\sin t \\sin\\alpha = \\cos(t-\\alpha)$.\n    The maximum value is 1 and the minimum value is -1.\n\n*   **On the lower semi-ellipse ($x=\\cos t, y=5\\sin t$):**\n    $g(t) = \\cos t \\cos\\alpha + 5\\sin t \\sin\\alpha$.\n    This expression is of the form $A\\cos\\theta + B\\sin\\theta$, whose maximum and minimum values are $\\pm\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}$.\n    Here, $A=\\cos\\alpha$ and $B=5\\sin\\alpha$.\n    So, the maximum value is $\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\alpha + (5\\sin\\alpha)^2} = \\sqrt{\\cos^2\\alpha + 25\\sin^2\\alpha}$.\n    The minimum value is $-\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\alpha + 25\\sin^2\\alpha}$.\n\nNow we combine these results to find the extrema over the entire figure:\n*   $\\max_{p \\in F} (p \\cdot u) = \\max(1, \\sqrt{\\cos^2\\alpha + 25\\sin^2\\alpha})$\n    Since $\\cos^2\\alpha + 25\\sin^2\\alpha = 1-\\sin^2\\alpha + 25\\sin^2\\alpha = 1+24\\sin^2\\alpha \\ge 1$, the maximum is $\\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\alpha}$.\n*   $\\min_{p \\in F} (p \\cdot u) = \\min(-1, -\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\alpha + 25\\sin^2\\alpha})$\n    Similarly, the minimum is $-\\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\alpha}$.\n\nThe width function is the difference between the maximum and minimum values:\n$W(\\alpha) = \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\alpha} - (-\\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\alpha}) = 2\\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\alpha}$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square**\n\nNow we need to find $s = \\min_{\\alpha} \\max( W(\\alpha), W(\\alpha + \\pi/2) )$.\nWe have $W(\\alpha) = 2\\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\alpha}$.\nAnd $W(\\alpha + \\pi/2) = 2\\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\pi/2)} = 2\\sqrt{1+24\\cos^2\\alpha}$.\n\nThe minimum of the maximum of these two functions occurs when they are equal:\n$W(\\alpha) = W(\\alpha+\\pi/2)$\n$1+24\\sin^2\\alpha = 1+24\\cos^2\\alpha$\n$\\sin^2\\alpha = \\cos^2\\alpha$\nThis holds true when $\\alpha = \\pi/4$ (and other related angles).\n\nThe side length of the smallest square is the value of the width function at this optimal angle:\n$s = W(\\pi/4) = 2\\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2(\\pi/4)}$\n$s = 2\\sqrt{1+24(1/\\sqrt{2})^2} = 2\\sqrt{1+24(1/2)} = 2\\sqrt{1+12} = 2\\sqrt{13}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final area**\n\nThe area of the smallest enclosing square is $s^2$.\nArea $= (2\\sqrt{13})^2 = 4 \\times 13 = 52$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The curve is piecewise, composed of parts of a circle and an ellipse.\n2.  The \"smallest square\" implies that we can orient the square at any angle, not just axis-aligned.\n3.  A common pitfall is to find the smallest square that encloses the axis-aligned bounding box of the figure. This is incorrect because the figure can be \"wider\" than its bounding box in some directions.\n4.  The correct approach uses the width function of the figure's convex hull. The side of the smallest enclosing square is the minimum value of the maximum of the widths in two perpendicular directions.\n\nThe final answer is the area of a square with side length $2\\sqrt{13}$.\n\n<<<52>>>"
