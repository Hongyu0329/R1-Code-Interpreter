    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis* or similar species). The brain anatomy is generally conserved across cuttlefish species, so information from the well-studied common cuttlefish (*Sepia officinalis*) is applicable.\n    *   **Anatomical Landmark:** The palliovisceral lobe. This is our starting point.\n    *   **Spatial Relationship:** \"Adjacent posteriorly\". This means we are looking for the brain structures that are situated immediately behind or toward the tail-end of the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n2.  **Locate the Palliovisceral Lobe:**\n    *   The cuttlefish brain is a complex structure that encircles the esophagus. It is divided into two main parts: the supraesophageal mass (above the esophagus) and the subesophageal mass (below the esophagus).\n    *   The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the **posterior subesophageal mass**.\n    *   As its name implies (pallio- from pallium, meaning mantle; visceral referring to internal organs), this lobe is primarily responsible for controlling the muscles of the mantle, the funnel (siphon), and the visceral organs (gills, heart, etc.).\n\n3.  **Identify Posteriorly Adjacent Regions:**\n    *   To find what lies behind the palliovisceral lobe, we must examine the organization of the posterior subesophageal mass. This part of the brain is the most posterior region of the entire central nervous system.\n    *   Reviewing neuroanatomical diagrams and descriptions of the cuttlefish brain (e.g., from works by J.Z. Young or Nixon & Young), we can identify the structures in this rearmost area.\n    *   The following lobes are located in the posterior-most part of the subesophageal mass, adjacent to the main body of the palliovisceral lobe:\n        *   **Giant Fiber Lobes:** These are arguably the most direct and functionally significant structures posterior to the palliovisceral lobe. They contain the third-order giant neurons that trigger the powerful, simultaneous contraction of the mantle muscles for jet-propulsion escape. The second-order giant neurons are within the palliovisceral lobe itself, making the giant fiber lobes a direct posterior and functional extension.\n        *   **Vasomotor Lobes:** These lobes are involved in the control of blood circulation, including the branchial hearts and systemic heart. They are situated ventrally and posteriorly within the subesophageal mass, adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe.\n        *   **Posterior Fin Lobes:** Cuttlefish have lateral fins running along their body that they use for stabilization, hovering, and slow, undulating swimming. The nerves controlling these fins originate from the posterior fin lobes, which are also located in the posterior-most region of the brain, near the palliovisceral and vasomotor lobes.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Three-Dimensional Complexity:** The brain is not a simple linear structure. \"Posterior\" can also mean \"posterior and slightly ventral\" or \"posterior and slightly lateral\". The lobes mentioned (giant fiber, vasomotor, fin) form a complex at the rear of the brain.\n*   **Functional Integration:** These posterior lobes are not just spatially close; they are functionally integrated. The palliovisceral lobe controls the mantle and viscera, the vasomotor lobes control circulation to those areas, the fin lobes control adjacent fins, and the giant fiber lobes initiate the emergency escape maneuver using the mantleâ€”all are related to posterior body functions.\n*   **Terminology:** Different authors might use slightly different names, but the concepts of lobes for giant fiber command, circulatory control, and fin control are standard in cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the palliovisceral lobe forms the bulk of the posterior subesophageal mass. The brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to it are the specialized lobes at the very rear of the brain. These are the giant fiber lobes, the vasomotor lobes, and the posterior fin lobes.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the **giant fiber lobes**, the **vasomotor lobes**, and the **posterior fin lobes**.>>>"
