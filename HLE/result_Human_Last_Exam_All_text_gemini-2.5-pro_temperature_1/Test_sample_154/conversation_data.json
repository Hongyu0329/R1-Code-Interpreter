    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** A graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has a set of vertices V such that |V| = 5.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same structure, meaning there's a one-to-one mapping of vertices that preserves adjacency.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (Biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it is connected and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This implies the graph has no cut vertices (or articulation points). An important property of such graphs on n > 2 vertices is that the minimum degree of any vertex (δ) must be at least 2.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Analysis by Number of Edges (m)**\n\nWe will enumerate the possibilities for the number of edges, m. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5,2) = 10. A connected graph with n=5 vertices must have at least n-1 = 4 edges.\n\n*   **m < 4:** Graphs with fewer than 4 edges cannot be connected, so they cannot be 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count = 0**\n\n*   **m = 4:** A connected graph with 5 vertices and 4 edges must be a tree. Any tree with more than 2 vertices has at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1). A vertex of degree 1 has its neighbor as a potential cut vertex. In a 5-vertex tree, removing the neighbor of a leaf will disconnect that leaf from the rest of the graph. Therefore, no tree on 5 vertices is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count = 0**\n\n*   **m = 5:** A connected graph with n vertices and n edges contains exactly one cycle. To be 2-vertex-connected, the graph cannot have any cut vertices. This occurs only if the graph itself is a simple cycle. Any other structure, like a cycle with a \"tail,\" would have a cut vertex.\n    *   The only such graph is the cycle graph **C5**. Removing any vertex from C5 leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Thus, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count = 1**\n\n*   **m = 6:** We need to examine the non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges. There are 6 such graphs. We check each for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n    1.  **C5 with one chord:** This graph is 2-vertex-connected. The minimum degree is 2, and removing any vertex leaves a connected subgraph.\n    2.  **Two triangles sharing a vertex (bowtie graph):** The central vertex of degree 4 is a cut vertex. Not 2-vertex-connected.\n    3.  **C4 with a pendant edge:** The vertex on the cycle where the edge is attached is a cut vertex. Not 2-vertex-connected.\n    4.  **C3 with a path of length 2 attached:** The vertex on the cycle where the path is attached is a cut vertex. Not 2-vertex-connected.\n    5.  **K1,4 (star graph) with an edge added between two leaves:** This graph still has two vertices of degree 1. Not 2-vertex-connected.\n    6.  **C3 + K2 (disconnected):** Not connected, so not 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   Only one of these is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count = 1**\n\n*   **m > 6 (Dense Graphs):** For denser graphs, it's often easier to analyze their complements. The complement of a graph G has an edge between two vertices if and only if there is no edge between them in G. A graph G with 5 vertices is 2-vertex-connected if and only if its complement G' is not \"splittable\" by removing a vertex in a specific way (specifically, G-v is connected for all v).\n\n*   **m = 7:** The complement graph has 10 - 7 = 3 edges. There are 4 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices and 3 edges. We check the connectivity of their complements.\n    1.  **G' = P4 + isolated vertex:** The complement G = K5 - E(P4) is 2-vertex-connected. (Verified by checking vertex removals).\n    2.  **G' = K1,3 + isolated vertex:** The complement G has the isolated vertex of G' as a cut vertex. (Removing it leaves a disconnected subgraph). Not 2-vertex-connected.\n    3.  **G' = C3 + 2 isolated vertices:** The complement G = K5 - E(C3) is 2-vertex-connected. (Verified by checking vertex removals).\n    4.  **G' = P3 + K2:** The complement G = K5 - E(P3) - E(K2) is 2-vertex-connected. (Verified by checking vertex removals).\n    *   **Count = 3**\n\n*   **m = 8:** The complement graph has 10 - 8 = 2 edges. There are 2 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges.\n    1.  **G' = P3 + 2 isolated vertices:** The complement G is 2-vertex-connected. Its minimum degree is 5-1-Δ(G') = 5-1-2 = 2. It can be verified that it has no cut vertices.\n    2.  **G' = K2 + K2 + 1 isolated vertex:** The complement G is 2-vertex-connected. Its minimum degree is 5-1-Δ(G') = 5-1-1 = 3. Any graph on 5 vertices with a minimum degree of 3 is necessarily 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count = 2**\n\n*   **m = 9:** The complement graph has 10 - 9 = 1 edge. There is only 1 such graph.\n    1.  **G' = K2 + 3 isolated vertices:** The complement G is K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). This graph is 2-vertex-connected. Its minimum degree is 3.\n    *   **Count = 1**\n\n*   **m = 10:** The complement graph has 10 - 10 = 0 edges. There is only 1 such graph (5 isolated vertices).\n    1.  **G' = 5 isolated vertices:** The complement G is the complete graph K5. K5 is 4-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count = 1**\n\n### **3. Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1\n*   m=6: 1\n*   m=7: 3\n*   m=8: 2\n*   m=9: 1\n*   m=10: 1\n\n**Total = 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9**\n\nThere are 9 such graphs.\n\n<<<9>>>"
