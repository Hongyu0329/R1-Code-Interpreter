The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is highly dependent on the specific catalytic application.
- For the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, the optimal atomic Ni/Ce ratio is generally in the range of **0.25 to 0.5**.
- For **Water Splitting (WS)**, the ideal ratio varies significantly with the method:
  - For **electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution (HER)**, an atomic ratio of approximately **1.0** is often optimal.
  - For **electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution (OER)**, a lower atomic ratio of around **0.25** is more effective.
  - For **thermochemical water splitting cycles**, a much smaller ratio of about **0.05** is ideal, where Ni acts as a dopant.
