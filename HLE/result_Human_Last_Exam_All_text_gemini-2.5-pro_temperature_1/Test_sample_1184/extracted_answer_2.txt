The answer is structured into two parts, addressing each question. The residue numbers correspond to the human CACNB1 isoform 1 (UniProt: Q02641).

**1) Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit (Binding Residues):**

The high-affinity physical binding between the beta-1 and alpha-1 subunits occurs when the Beta Interaction Domain (BID) on the beta-1 subunit's GK domain binds to the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) on the alpha-1 subunit. The key residues in the human beta-1 subunit that form the hydrophobic binding pocket of the BID are:
*   **Tyr343** (Tyrosine at position 343)
*   **Val345** (Valine at position 345)
*   **Trp348** (Tryptophan at position 348)
*   **Leu352** (Leucine at position 352)
*   **Tyr397** (Tyrosine at position 397)
*   **Ile399** (Isoleucine at position 399)
*   **Val401** (Valine at position 401)
*   **Trp420** (Tryptophan at position 420)
*   **Leu423** (Leucine at position 423)

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (Gating Modulation):**

Gating modulation is a more complex process mediated by secondary interactions involving larger domains of the beta-1 subunit. The primary hotspots are regions rather than a specific list of amino acids.
*   **N-terminal Domain:** This is the most critical region for determining the specific type of gating modulation. The N-termini vary between beta-1 splice variants, conferring unique modulatory properties. For the widely expressed Î²1b isoform, the hotspot region is comprised of the first **~70 amino acids (residues 1-71)**. This region is a major determinant of shifts in the voltage-dependence of activation and inactivation kinetics.
*   **SH3 Domain:** This domain, located at approximately **residues 168-230**, also contributes to gating modulation through secondary interactions with the alpha-1 subunit.
*   **Hook Region:** The flexible linker region connecting the SH3 and GK domains (approximately **residues 231-287**) plays a role in correctly positioning the modulatory domains and contributes to the overall effect.
