    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine what \"X-Y\" refers to in the given context.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure:** The question centers on Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943). It's crucial to understand who he was. Milyukov was a prominent Russian historian, a liberal politician, and the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (the Kadets). He was a major figure in the intellectual and political life of Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n2.  **Analyze Milyukov's Intellectual Stance:** Milyukov was a firm believer in rationalism, positivism, and progress. He championed a Western-style, liberal, and constitutional path for Russia's development. His worldview was shaped by the 19th-century emphasis on science, reason, and social responsibility.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Quote:** Milyukov is said to have \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time\" and denounced \"X-Ys as a 'stagnant swamp'\".\n    *   The phrase \"stagnant swamp\" is a powerful metaphor suggesting decay, lack of progress, moral corruption, and uselessness.\n    *   The accusation is directed at a specific group or movement, represented by \"X-Y\".\n    *   The context is a critique of contemporary culture, which Milyukov saw as a departure from the positive ideals he held.\n\n4.  **Identify the Historical and Cultural Context:** The period in question is the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time known in Russia as the \"Silver Age\". This era was characterized by a move away from the 19th-century's realism and social criticism in art and literature. New movements, heavily influenced by Western European trends like French Symbolism and the Decadent movement, emerged. These new movements emphasized mysticism, individualism, aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), and introspection.\n\n5.  **Connect Milyukov to the Context:** As a representative of the older, rationalist intelligentsia, Milyukov was a fierce opponent of these new \"modernist\" trends. He saw them as a betrayal of the intellectual's duty to serve society and promote progress. He viewed their focus on the mystical and the aesthetic as self-indulgent, irrational, and politically irresponsibleâ€”a form of cultural decay.\n\n6.  **Determine \"X-Y\":** The primary target of Milyukov's and other traditional liberals' criticism during the Silver Age was the most prominent and influential of these new movements: **Russian Symbolism**. The Russian Symbolists (figures like Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Zinaida Gippius, Valery Bryusov, and Andrei Bely) were precisely the group whose philosophy and art Milyukov found so objectionable. His description of them as a \"stagnant swamp\" perfectly captures his view of their movement as being detached from the real, progressive needs of Russian society.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The term \"X-Y\" in the quote refers to the **Russian Symbolists**. They were the specific cultural movement that Pavel Milyukov, from his positivist and liberal standpoint, famously denounced as a decadent and unproductive \"stagnant swamp\".\n\n***\n\n<<<Russian Symbolists>>>"
