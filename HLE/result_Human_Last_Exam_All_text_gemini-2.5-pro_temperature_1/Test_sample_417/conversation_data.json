    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the IUPAC Name:**\n    The molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n    *   **Central Core:** The core is a benzene ring substituted at all six positions.\n        *   At positions 2, 4, and 6, there are methyl groups (-CH₃).\n        *   At positions 1, 3, and 5, there are substituted methyl groups (-CH₂-R), where R is the large heterocyclic group in the square brackets.\n    *   **Substituent (R group):** The R group is ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl).\n        *   This is a chiral, bicyclic system derived from indazole, which is itself a fusion of a pyrazole and a benzene ring.\n        *   `4,5,6,7-tetrahydro`: The \"benzene\" part of the indazole is saturated.\n        *   `4,7-methano`: A bridge connects carbons C4 and C7, creating a rigid bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-like framework fused to the pyrazole ring. Let's call the bridge carbon C8.\n        *   `7,8,8-trimethyl`: A methyl group is on C7, and two methyl groups are on the bridge carbon C8.\n        *   `2H-indazol-2-yl`: The attachment to the -CH₂- group of the central core is at the N2 position of the indazole's pyrazole ring.\n        *   `(4S,7R)`: This specifies the absolute configuration at the chiral centers C4 and C7, making the substituent enantiopure.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Overall Molecular Symmetry:**\n    *   The central core has three identical methyl groups at C2, C4, C6 and three identical -CH₂-R groups at C1, C3, C5.\n    *   Since the substituent R group, `((4S,7R)...)`, is the same for all three arms, the entire molecule possesses a C₃ axis of rotational symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Due to this C₃ symmetry, the three `-CH₃` groups are chemically equivalent, and the three `-CH₂-R` \"arms\" are also chemically equivalent.\n    *   To find the total number of signals, we need to find the number of unique proton environments in one-third of the molecule: one `-CH₃` group and one `-CH₂-R` arm.\n\n3.  **Count the Unique Proton Signals:**\n\n    We will count the number of magnetically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n    *   **Signals from the Central Core:**\n        1.  **Ar-CH₃ protons:** The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to C₃ symmetry. They will produce a single peak. (1 signal)\n        2.  **Ar-CH₂- protons:** The three methylene (-CH₂-) linkers are equivalent by C₃ symmetry. However, each -CH₂- group is attached to the achiral benzene ring and a chiral R group. Protons on a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, the two protons of each CH₂ group will have different chemical shifts and will appear as two distinct signals (likely an AB quartet). (2 signals)\n\n    *   **Signals from one R group (the chiral substituent):**\n        We need to identify all the unique proton environments within one of the three identical R groups. Let's analyze the structure `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole`.\n        *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring, at position C3. This is a unique environment. (1 signal)\n        *   **Bicyclic Framework Protons:**\n            *   **C4-H:** The proton on the bridgehead carbon C4 is in a unique environment. (1 signal)\n            *   **C5-H₂:** This is a methylene group within the rigid bicyclic system. The two protons (exo and endo) are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. (2 signals)\n            *   **C6-H₂:** This is another methylene group. Its protons are also diastereotopic (exo and endo). Furthermore, C6 is adjacent to C7 (which has a methyl group), while C5 is adjacent to C4 (which has a hydrogen). Therefore, the C5 and C6 positions are non-equivalent, and the four protons on these two methylenes give four distinct signals in total. (2 signals from C6)\n            *   **C7:** This carbon has a methyl group and is a quaternary stereocenter, so it has no proton attached.\n        *   **Methyl Group Protons:**\n            *   **C7-CH₃:** The methyl group on C7 is in a unique environment. (1 signal)\n            *   **C8-(CH₃)₂:** The two methyl groups are on the bridge carbon C8. Since they are part of a rigid chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic. One is `syn` (closer to the pyrazole ring) and the other is `anti`. They will give two separate signals. (2 signals)\n\n4.  **Summing up the Signals:**\n\n    Let's tally the number of unique proton signals:\n    *   From the three Ar-CH₃ groups: 1 signal\n    *   From the three Ar-CH₂- linkers: 2 signals (diastereotopic protons)\n    *   From the R group:\n        *   1 signal (C3-H)\n        *   1 signal (C4-H)\n        *   2 signals (C5-H₂)\n        *   2 signals (C6-H₂)\n        *   1 signal (C7-CH₃)\n        *   2 signals (C8-(CH₃)₂)\n        *   Total from R group = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 signals.\n\n    *   **Total Number of Signals = 1 (Ar-CH₃) + 2 (Ar-CH₂) + 9 (R group) = 12 signals.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the C₃ symmetry of the molecule and the diastereotopicity of protons within the chiral arms, there are a total of 12 expected peaks in the ¹H NMR spectrum, assuming no accidental overlap of signals.\n\nFinal check of the list of 12 distinct proton environments:\n1.
