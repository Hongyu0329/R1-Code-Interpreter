To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape from a flat configuration (representing the stable *trans*-isomer) to a bent configuration (representing the *cis*-isomer) when the sun rises and exposes it to UV light. When the sun sets and the UV light source is removed, the table must revert back from the bent shape to its original flat configuration.
