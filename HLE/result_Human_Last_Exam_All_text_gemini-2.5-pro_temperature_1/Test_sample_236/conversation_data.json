    "This problem asks for the number of distinct elements of the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta_3^H$, that can be obtained by performing integral surgery on a knot with four or fewer crossings.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the relevant surgical procedures.**\nThe elements of the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$ are oriented homology 3-spheres, where two are considered equivalent if they are homology cobordant. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\nWe are considering manifolds created by integral surgery on a knot $K$ in $S^3$. This procedure results in a manifold denoted $S^3_n(K)$, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is the surgery coefficient.\n\nFor $S^3_n(K)$ to be a homology 3-sphere (i.e., having the same integer homology groups as $S^3$), its first homology group must be trivial. The first homology group of a surgered manifold is given by $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor this group to be the trivial group {0}, we must have $|n|=1$. Therefore, the only integral surgeries that produce homology 3-spheres are $+1$ surgery and $-1$ surgery. We need to analyze the manifolds $S^3_1(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify all knots with at most four crossings.**\nWe list the distinct knots (up to isotopy) with a crossing number $c(K) \\le 4$.\n\n*   **c(K) = 0:** The unknot ($0_1$). This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n*   **c(K) = 1, 2:** There are no knots with these crossing numbers. Any such diagram represents the unknot.\n*   **c(K) = 3:** The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral, so the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (its mirror, $-3_1$) are distinct knots.\n*   **c(K) = 4:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphichiral.\n*   **Composite Knots:** The crossing number of a connected sum of knots is the sum of their individual crossing numbers ($c(K_1 \\# K_2) = c(K_1) + c(K_2)$). Since the simplest non-trivial knot has 3 crossings, the simplest composite knot has $3+3=6$ crossings. Thus, no composite knots have a crossing number of 4 or less.\n\nOur analysis will focus on the unknot, the trefoil knot, and the figure-eight knot.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the homology cobordism classes for each knot.**\n\n*   **The Unknot ($0_1$):**\n    *   Surgery on the unknot with coefficients $+1$ or $-1$ both yield the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3_1(0_1) = S^3$ and $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$.\n    *   $S^3$ represents the identity element in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n    *   Thus, the unknot gives **one element**: the identity.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$):**\n    *   We consider surgeries on both the right-handed ($3_1$) and left-handed ($-3_1$) trefoils.\n    *   Let $P = [S^3_1(3_1)]$ be the homology cobordism class of $+1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil. This manifold is the Poincaré homology sphere, a well-known non-trivial element of order 2 in $\\Theta_3^H$. Having order 2 means $P = -P$.\n    *   There is a general identity relating surgery on a knot $K$ and its mirror $-K$: $S^3_n(-K)$ is orientation-reversingly diffeomorphic to $S^3_{-n}(K)$. In terms of homology cobordism classes, this means $[S^3_n(-K)] = -[S^3_{-n}(K)]$.\n    *   Let's apply this to the trefoil:\n        1.  $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$: Using the relation with $K=3_1$ and $n=1$, we have $[S^3_1(-3_1)] = -[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$. But $S^3_1(-3_1)$ is the left-handed Poincaré sphere, so its class is $-P$. Therefore, $-P = -[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$, which implies $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)] = P$.\n        2.  $[S^3_1(-3_1)] = -P$. Since $P$ has order 2, $-P=P$.\n        3.  $[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)]$: Using the relation with $K=3_1$ and $n=-1$, we have $[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)] = -[S^3_1(3_1)] = -P = P$.\n    *   All four possible surgeries ($+1$ and $-1$ on both $3_1$ and $-3_1$) yield manifolds that represent the same single, non-trivial element $P$ in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n    *   Thus, the trefoil knot gives **one non-trivial element**.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$):**\n    *   The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, so $4_1 = -4_1$.\n    *   Let $A = [S^3_1(4_1)]$. Applying the identity $S^3_n(K) = -S^3_{-n}(-K)$ with $K=4_1$ and $n=1$ gives $[S^3_1(4_1)] = -[S^3_{-1}(-4_1)]$. Since $4_1$ is amphichiral, $-4_1=4_1$, so $A = -[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$.\n    *   This means the two surgeries give elements $A$ and $-A$.\n    *   To determine if $A$ and $-A$ are distinct, we check if $A$ has order 2. An element has order 2 only if its Rohlin invariant is 1. The Rohlin invariant of $S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)$ is the Arf invariant of $K$ (mod 2). The Arf invariant of the figure-eight knot is 0. Thus, the Rohlin invariant of $A$ is 0, so $A$ is not an element of order 2. Therefore, $A \\neq -A$.\n    *   To check if $A$ is trivial, we can use the Casson invariant. For $S^3_1(4_1)$, the Casson invariant is $\\lambda(S^3_1(4_1)) = 1 \\neq 0$. Thus, $A$ is not the trivial element. Consequently, $-A$ is also non-trivial.\n    *   Thus, the figure-eight knot gives **two distinct non-trivial elements**.\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of distinct elements.**\nWe have found the following set of elements:\n1.  The identity element, $0$, from the unknot.\n2.  The element $P$ (the class of the Poincaré sphere) from the trefoil knot.\n3.  The element $A = [S^3_1(4_1)]$ from the figure-eight knot.\n4.  The element $-A = [S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$ from the figure-eight knot.\n\nThese four elements are all distinct.\n*   $0$ is distinct from the others because they are non-trivial.\n*   $P$ is distinct from $A$ and $-A$ because their Rohlin invariants differ ($\\mu(P)=1$, while $\\mu(A)=\\mu(-A)=0$).\n*   $A$ is distinct from $-A$ because $A$ is not of order 2.\n\nIn total, there are 4 distinct elements in the homology cobordism group that can be represented this way.\n\nThe final count is $1 (from~unknot) + 1 (from~trefoil) + 2 (from~figure-eight) = 4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
