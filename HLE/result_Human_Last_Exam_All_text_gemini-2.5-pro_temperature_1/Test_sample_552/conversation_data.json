    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify the person whose **lectures** were **cited** by **Albert Einstein** in his **1905 paper on Brownian motion**.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the specific paper in question.**\nIn 1905, his \"miracle year,\" Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. The one on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the meaning of \"cite\" in the context of early 20th-century scientific papers.**\nModern scientific papers have a formal bibliography or reference list. However, in the early 1900s, this was not always the case. A \"citation\" could be a direct mention in the text or even an implicit reference to a well-known theory or work. The question asks about \"lectures,\" which is a very specific form of work.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the content of Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper for citations.**\nA direct analysis of the paper reveals a remarkable fact: it contains almost no references or footnotes to the work of other scientists. This is a known characteristic of Einstein's early papers, highlighting his method of reasoning from fundamental principles. He does not formally cite anyone's lectures in the way we would today.\n\n**Step 5: Investigate the intellectual foundations of the paper.**\nDespite the lack of formal citations, the paper is not created in a vacuum. Its very title refers to the \"molecular-kinetic theory of heat.\" The principal architect and champion of this theory was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**.\n\n**Step 6: Connect the intellectual foundation to the term \"lectures.\"**\nLudwig Boltzmann's most comprehensive and influential work on this topic was a two-volume book published in 1896 and 1898. The title of this book is ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie***, which translates to ***Lectures on Gas Theory***. Einstein is known to have studied this specific work very closely in the years leading up to 1905.\n\n**Step 7: Synthesize the findings to answer the question.**\nAlthough Einstein did not include a formal bibliographic citation in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, the entire paper is an application and confirmation of the molecular-kinetic theory. The foundational text for this theory, which Einstein studied, was Ludwig Boltzmann's published *Lectures on Gas Theory*. Therefore, while not a citation in the modern sense, the person whose lectures he was intellectually citing and building upon was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
