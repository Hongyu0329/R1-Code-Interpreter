    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct verses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem and its Subject:** The poem in question is 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. It is a foundational text summarizing the essential articles of Islamic faith (aqeedah) in poetic form for easy memorization. One of these articles is the belief in the Messengers of Allah.\n\n2.  **Understand the Requirement of Believing in the Prophets:** In traditional Sunni theology, it is considered obligatory for a Muslim to know the 25 prophets who are mentioned by name in the Qur'an. 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', being a comprehensive summary of this creed, dedicates a specific section to listing these prophets.\n\n3.  **Locate the Introductory Verse:** Before listing the names, the author typically introduces the topic. We look for a verse that states the number of prophets to be mentioned.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish the verse that introduces the list from the verses that contain the list itself.\n    *   **Verse 28** serves this introductory purpose. It says:\n        تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ ¤ كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n        *\"The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every legally responsible person, so verify and seize [this knowledge].\"*\n    *   This verse confirms that a list of 25 prophets will follow, but it does not contain any of their names.\n\n4.  **Identify the Starting Verse of the List:** The enumeration of the prophets' names begins in the verse immediately following the introduction.\n    *   **Verse 29** is the first verse that contains the names:\n        هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ ¤ صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        *\"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.\"*\n    *   Therefore, the list begins at **bayt 29**.\n\n5.  **Trace the Continuation of the List:** We must follow the subsequent verses to see where the list ends.\n    *   **Verse 30** continues the list: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Verse 31** continues the list: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n6.  **Identify the Concluding Verse of the List:** We need to find the final verse that contains the last names from the list of 25.\n    *   **Verse 32** concludes the list of names:\n        اِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ¤ عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        *\"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the seal; leave aside deviation.\"*\n    *   This verse contains the final names, ending with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is referred to as \"Taha\" and \"Khatim\" (the Seal). Therefore, the list ends at **bayt 32**.\n\n7.  **Examine the Verse After the List:** To confirm the end of the section, we can look at the next verse.\n    *   **Verse 33** sends prayers and peace upon the prophets just mentioned, which is a common way to conclude such a list:\n        عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ ¤ وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n        *\"Upon them be prayers and peace, and upon their families, as long as the days endure.\"*\n    *   This verse does not name any prophets but rather concludes the section about them.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the names of the prophets are explicitly mentioned in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' starting from bayt (verse) 29 and ending at bayt 32.\n\n<<<From bayt 29 to bayt 32.>>>"
