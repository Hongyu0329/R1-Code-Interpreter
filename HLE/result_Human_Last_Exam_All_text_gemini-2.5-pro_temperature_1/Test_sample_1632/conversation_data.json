    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice (a 2D square grid). Let's denote this number by `a(10)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A 2D grid of points (x, y) where x and y are integers. A walk consists of moving from one point to an adjacent one.\n*   **A move:** From any point (x, y), a move can be made to one of four adjacent points: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1).\n*   **n-step walk:** A sequence of `n` consecutive moves. We assume the walk starts at the origin (0,0).\n*   **Self-avoiding walk (SAW):** A walk that does not visit the same point more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from the origin.\n\n**2. Calculating for Small Values of `n`**\n\nLet's calculate the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` to understand the process and its complexity.\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible first steps: to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All are valid.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    For each of the 4 possible 1-step walks, we consider the second step. The walk cannot immediately reverse direction. For example, if the first step was to (1,0), the second step cannot be to (0,0). It must be to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1). So, there are 3 valid choices for the second step.\n    *   `a(2) = a(1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    For each of the 12 possible 2-step walks, we consider the third step. The only forbidden move is back to the previous point. We also must not step on the origin (0,0). Let's check if this is possible. A 2-step walk can end at a point like (2,0) or (1,1). Neither of these points is adjacent to the origin (0,0). Therefore, the only restriction is not reversing the last move.\n    *   `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    Here, the problem becomes more complex. For a 3-step walk, the endpoint can be adjacent to a previously visited point (specifically, the origin).\n    *   **Case 1: The walk gets \"trapped\".** Consider a path like (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1). The endpoint (0,1) is adjacent to the starting point (0,0). From (0,1), the possible moves are to (0,0), (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2). The move to (0,0) is forbidden (self-avoiding rule), and the move to (1,1) is forbidden (reversing the last step). Thus, there are only **2** valid choices for the fourth step.\n    *   We need to count how many 3-step paths end in this state. These are paths that form three sides of a 1x1 square. There are 4 choices for the first direction and 2 choices for the second turn (e.g., if first step is Right, second can be Up or Down). This gives `4 * 2 = 8` such \"trapped\" paths.\n    *   **Case 2: The walk is not \"trapped\".** The remaining `a(3) - 8 = 36 - 8 = 28` paths do not end adjacent to the origin. For these paths, there are **3** valid choices for the fourth step (any direction except reversing the last move).\n    *   Combining these cases: `a(4) = (8 paths * 2 choices) + (28 paths * 3 choices) = 16 + 84 = 100`.\n\n**3. The Problem for n=10**\n\nAs `n` increases, the number of possible intersections with earlier parts of the path grows rapidly. Manually enumerating all possibilities for `a(10)` is infeasible. This is a well-known and computationally difficult problem in combinatorics and statistical physics. There is no simple closed-form formula for `a(n)`.\n\n**4. Acquiring the Answer**\n\nThe sequence `a(n)` for self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is a standard mathematical sequence, listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411. The values have been computed using sophisticated computer algorithms. We can use this established result to find `a(10)`.\n\nThe known values for `a(n)` are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
