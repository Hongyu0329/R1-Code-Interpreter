    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:**\n    We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT), `X(k)` and `H(k)`, of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n2.  **Analyze the DFT Calculation:**\n    The problem asks for the 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence. Let's denote the resulting 4-point DFT as `Y(k)`. The definition of an N-point DFT for a sequence of length M (where M >= N) is:\n    `Y(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{M-1} y(n) * W_N^(kn)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., N-1`.\n    In our case, N=4, M=8, and `W_4 = exp(-j*2*π/4) = -j`.\n    `Y(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_4^(kn)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n3.  **Use the Property of Time-Domain Aliasing:**\n    The term `W_4^(kn)` is periodic in `n` with a period of 4 (i.e., `W_4^(k(n+4)) = W_4^(kn)`). We can split the summation from n=0 to 7 into two parts:\n    `Y(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(n) * W_4^(kn) + Σ_{n=4}^{7} y(n) * W_4^(kn)`\n    Let's change the variable in the second sum to `m = n - 4`. This means `n = m + 4`.\n    `Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(m+4) * W_4^(k(m+4)) = Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(m+4) * W_4^(km) * W_4^(4k)`\n    Since `W_4^4 = (exp(-j*2*π/4))^4 = exp(-j*2*π) = 1`, the expression simplifies to `Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(m+4) * W_4^(km)`.\n    Substituting this back and using `n` as the summation index for both parts, we get:\n    `Y(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(n) * W_4^(kn) + Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(n+4) * W_4^(kn) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} [y(n) + y(n+4)] * W_4^(kn)`\n    This crucial result shows that the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)` is the same as the 4-point DFT of a 4-point sequence `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)`.\n\n4.  **Construct the 4-point sequence `z(n)`:**\n    Using the definitions of `y(n)` and `z(n)`:\n    *   `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n    *   `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n    *   `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n    *   `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n    So, `z(n) = {x(0)+x(2), h(0)+h(2), x(1)+x(3), h(1)+h(3)}`.\n\n5.  **Relate the DFT of `z(n)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`:**\n    We need to find `Z(k) = DFT{z(n)}`. Let's use the decimation-in-time property of the DFT. We can express `Z(k)` in terms of the DFTs of the even-indexed and odd-indexed samples of `z(n)`.\n    *   Even-indexed part of `z(n)`: `z_e(m) = {z(0), z(2)} = {x(0)+x(2), x(1)+x(3)}`\n    *   Odd-indexed part of `z(n)`: `z_o(m) = {z(1), z(3)} = {h(0)+h(2), h(1)+h(3)}`\n\n    Now, let's use the DFT property relating the even-indexed DFT samples to a time-domain sum: `DFT_{N/2}{s(n) + s(n+N/2)} = S(2k)`.\n    *   For the sequence `x(n)` (with N=4), `DFT_2{x(n)+x(n+2)} = X(2k)`. The 2-point sequence here is `{x(0)+x(2), x(1)+x(3)}`, which is exactly `z_e(m)`. Therefore, the 2-point DFT of `z_e(m)` is `{X(0), X(2)}`.\n    *   Similarly for `h(n)`, `DFT_2{h(n)+h(n+2)} = H(2k)`. The 2-point sequence is `{h(0)+h(2), h(1)+h(3)}`, which is `z_o(m)`. Therefore, the 2-point DFT of `z_o(m)` is `{H(0), H(2)}`.\n\n6.  **Combine the DFTs to find `Z(k)`:**\n    Let `Z_e(k) = DFT{z_e(m)} = {X(0), X(2)}` and `Z_o(k) = DFT{z_o(m)} = {H(0), H(2)}`.\n    The 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is constructed as:\n    `Z(k) = Z_e(k mod 2) + W_4^k * Z_o(k mod 2)`.\n    *   For k=0: `Z(0) = Z_e(0) + W_4^0 * Z_o(0) = X(0) + 1 * H(0) = X(0) + H(0)`\n    *   For k=1: `Z(1) = Z_e(1) + W_4^1 * Z_o(1) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2) = X(2) - j*H(2)`\n    *   For k=2: `Z(2) = Z_e(0) + W_4^2 * Z_o(0) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = X(0) - H(0)`\n    *   For k=3: `Z(3) = Z_e(1) + W_4^3 * Z_o(1) = X(2) + (j) * H(2) = X(2) + j*H(2)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the given values and compute:**\n    *   Given `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`. We use `X(0) = 1` and `X(2) = -1`.\n    *   Given `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`. We use `H(0) = 0` and `H(2) = 1`.\n    *   `Z(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   `Z(1) = -1 - j(1) = -1 - j`\n    *   `Z(2) = 1 - 0 = 1`\n    *   `Z(3) = -1 + j(1) = -1 + j`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is the vector `[Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
