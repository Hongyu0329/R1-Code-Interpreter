    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe problem is a riddle presented in the form of a haiku. The key is to understand that the title itself, \"The Bays,\" is a pun and forms the central question.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **The Title as a Question:** The title \"The Bays\" is a homophone for \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\".\n2.  **Haiku as Clues:** Each of the three lines in the haiku serves as a clue to a word that begins with the letter 'B'.\n3.  **Alphabetical Order:** The final answer must be a list of these \"B\" words, arranged in alphabetical order.\n4.  **Metaphor and Wordplay:** The clues are not literal and require some interpretation of metaphors, general knowledge, and wordplay.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n*   **Step 1: Decipher the first line.**\n    *   The line is: \"An August tempest\".\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent, windy storm. A common, simple word for a strong gale or storm that starts with 'B' is a **Blow**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Decipher the second line.**\n    *   The line is: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\".\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" calculates to 30 (2 * 15). The phrase \"winds of change\" refers to varying wind speeds.\n    *   The **Beaufort** scale is used to measure wind force. A wind speed of 30 knots falls within Force 7 (\"Near Gale\") on this scale. The clue points directly to the Beaufort scale.\n\n*   **Step 3: Decipher the third line.**\n    *   The line is: \"A divine one yields\".\n    *   This is a metaphorical clue. In many ancient cultures and mythologies (for instance, Greek mythology), bees were considered divine messengers or sacred creatures. Therefore, a \"divine one\" can refer to a **Bee**.\n    *   A bee \"yields\" or produces honey, which fits the second part of the clue.\n\n*   **Step 4: Consolidate and Alphabetize the Answers.**\n    *   The three \"B\" words found are: Blow, Beaufort, and Bee.\n    *   Now, we must arrange these words in alphabetical order as requested by the prompt.\n    1.  **Beaufort** (starts with B-E-A)\n    2.  **Bee** (starts with B-E-E)\n    3.  **Blow** (starts with B-L-O)\n\nThe final answer is the alphabetized list of these three words.\n\n<<<Beaufort, Bee, Blow>>>"
