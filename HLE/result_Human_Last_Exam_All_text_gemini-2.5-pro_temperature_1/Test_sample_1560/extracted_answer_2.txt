The final state of the system is probabilistic. After measuring one ququint (e.g., ququint A) in the computational basis, the system will collapse into one of five possible states. If the measurement outcome for ququint A is the state $|k\rangle_A$ (where $k$ is an integer from 0 to 4), the final state of the combined two-ququint system will be $|k\rangle_A \otimes |k\rangle_B$. Each of these five possible outcomes occurs with an equal probability of $1/5$.
