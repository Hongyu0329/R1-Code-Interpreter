    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$ for non-negative integer solutions $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the equation modulo 4**\n\nWe consider the squares of integers modulo 4:\n- If $x$ is even ($x=2k$), then $x^2 = 4k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\n- If $x$ is odd ($x=2k+1$), then $x^2 = 4k^2+4k+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n\nThe equation is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$.\nThe right side is $2024 = 4 \\times 506 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\nLet $k$ be the number of odd integers among $x_1, ..., x_5$. The sum of squares modulo 4 is $k \\times 1 + (5-k) \\times 0 = k$.\nSo, we must have $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. Since $0 \\le k \\le 5$, the possible values for $k$ are $k=0$ or $k=4$.\n\nThis splits the problem into two disjoint cases:\n- **Case I:** $k=4$. Four of the $x_i$ are odd, and one is even.\n- **Case II:** $k=0$. All five of the $x_i$ are even.\n\n**Step 2: Further analysis using modulo 8**\n\nThe squares of integers modulo 8 are:\n- If $x$ is odd, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n- If $x = 4k$ (multiple of 4), $x^2 = 16k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\n- If $x = 4k+2$ (even, not a multiple of 4), $x^2 = 16k^2+16k+4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\n\nThe right side is $2024 = 8 \\times 253 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\n\nFor **Case I (4 odd, 1 even)**, the sum of squares modulo 8 is $4 \\times 1 + x_{even}^2 \\equiv 4 + x_{even}^2 \\pmod 8$.\nFor this to be $0 \\pmod 8$, we need $x_{even}^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. This means the single even variable must be of the form $4k+2$.\n\nFor **Case II (all even)**, let $x_i = 2y_i$. The equation becomes:\n$(2y_1)^2 + (2y_2)^2 + (2y_3)^2 + (2y_4)^2 + (2y_5)^2 = 2024$\n$4(y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2 + y_5^2) = 2024$\n$y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2 + y_5^2 = 506$\nNow we analyze this new equation for non-negative integers $y_i$. The right side is $506 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$.\nLet $k'$ be the number of odd integers among $y_1, ..., y_5$. The sum of their squares modulo 4 is $k' \\times 1 + (5-k') \\times 0 = k'$.\nSo, $k' \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. The only possibility is $k'=2$.\nThis means for any solution in Case II, exactly two of the $y_i$ must be odd, and three must be even.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of solutions in Case I**\n\nWe need to find the number of solutions where four variables are odd and one is of the form $4k+2$.\nLet the even variable be $e$. There are 5 choices for which variable is $e$.\nThe possible values for $e$ are $2, 6, 10, ..., 42$ (since $46^2 > 2024$).\nFor each choice of $e$, we need to find the number of solutions to $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 = 2024 - e^2$, where $a,b,c,d$ are positive odd integers.\nLet $N = 2024-e^2$. For this equation to have solutions in odd integers, we need $N \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\n- $e=4k+2 \\implies e^2 = 4(2k+1)^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\n- $N = 2024 - e^2 \\equiv 0 - 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. This condition is always satisfied.\n\nA known result from number theory states that the number of ordered solutions $(a,b,c,d)$ in positive odd integers to $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=N$ is $\\sigma_1(N/4)$ (the sum of divisors of $N/4$), provided $N \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\n\nWe sum the number of solutions for each possible value of $e$:\n- $e=2, e^2=4, N=2020: \\sigma_1(505) = 1+5+101+505 = 612$\n- $e=6, e^2=36, N=1988: \\sigma_1(497) = \\sigma_1(7 \\cdot 71) = (1+7)(1+71) = 576$\n- $e=10, e^2=100, N=1924: \\sigma_1(481) = \\sigma_1(13 \\cdot 37) = (1+13)(1+37) = 532$\n- $e=14, e^2=196, N=1828: \\sigma_1(457) = 1+457 = 458$ (457 is prime)\n- $e=18, e^2=324, N=1700: \\sigma_1(425) = \\sigma_1(5^2 \\cdot 17) = (1+5+25)(1+17) = 558$\n- $e=22, e^2=484, N=1540: \\sigma_1(385) = \\sigma_1(5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11) = (6)(8)(12) = 576$\n- $e=26, e^2=676, N=1348: \\sigma_1(337) = 1+337 = 338$ (337 is prime)\n- $e=30, e^2=900, N=1124: \\sigma_1(281) = 1+281 = 282$ (281 is prime)\n- $e=34, e^2=1156, N=868: \\sigma_1(217) = \\sigma_1(7 \\cdot 31) = (8)(32) = 256$\n- $e=38, e^2=1444, N=580: \\sigma_1(145) = \\sigma_1(5 \\cdot 29) = (6)(30) = 180$\n- $e=42, e^2=1764, N=260: \\sigma_1(65) = \\sigma_1(5 \\cdot 13) = (6)(14) = 84$\n\nThe total number of ordered 4-tuples $(a,b,c,d)$ is the sum of these values:\n$S = 612+576+532+458+558+576+338+282+256+180+84 = 4452$.\nFor each choice of $e$, there are 5 positions for it in the tuple $(x_1, ..., x_5)$. So, the total number of solutions in Case I is $5 \\times S = 5 \\times 4452 = 22260$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of solutions in Case II**\n\nWe need to find the number of solutions to $y_1^2+...+y_5^2=506$ where two $y_i$ are odd and three are even. This requires a careful casework enumeration.\nLet the solution set of values be $\\{y_1, ..., y_5\\}$. The number of ways to arrange them into an ordered tuple depends on the repetitions of values and the odd/even constraint. For a set with two distinct odd values and three distinct even values, the number of arrangements is $\\binom{5}{2} \\times 2! \\times 3! = 120$. If there are repetitions, this number changes.\n\nA systematic search for all possible sets of values $\\{y_1, ..., y_5\\}$ (two odd, three even) whose squares sum to 506 yields the following (this is a very lengthy calculation, which is abbreviated here):\n1.  $\\{21, 1, 8, 0, 0\\}$: 60 solutions\n2.  $\\{19, 11, 4, 2, 2\\}$: 60 solutions\n3.  $\\{19, 9, 8, 0, 0\\}$: 60 solutions\n4.  $\\{19, 7, 8, 4, 4\\}$: 60 solutions\n5.  $\\{19, 5, 10, 4, 2\\}$: 120 solutions\n6.  $\\{19, 3, 10, 6, 0\\}$: 120 solutions\n7.  $\\{19, 1, 12, 0, 0\\}$ (60) and $\\{19, 1, 8, 8, 4\\}$ (60): 120 solutions\n8.  $\\{17, 13, 4, 4, 4\\}$: 20 solutions\n9.  $\\{17, 11, 8, 4, 4\\}$: 60 solutions\n10. $\\{17, 9, 10, 6, 0\\}$: 120 solutions\n11. $\\{17, 7, 10, 8, 2\\}$: 120 solutions\n12. $\\{17, 5, 8, 8, 8\\}$: 20 solutions\n13. $\\{17, 3, 12, 8, 0\\}$: 120 solutions\n14. $\\{17, 1, 14, 4, 2\\}$ (120) and $\\{17, 1, 10, 10, 4\\}$ (60): 180 solutions\n15. $\\{15, 11, 12, 4, 0\\}$: 120 solutions\n16. $\\{15, 9, 14, 2, 0\\}$ (120) and $\\{15, 9, 10, 10, 0\\}$ (60): 180 solutions\n17. $\\{15, 7, 14, 6, 0\\}$: 120 solutions\n18. $\\{15, 5, 16, 0, 0\\}$: 60 solutions\n19. $\\{15, 3, 16, 4, 0\\}$: 120 solutions\n20. $\\{15, 1, 12, 10, 6\\}$: 120 solutions\n21. $\\{13, 13, 10, 8, 2\\}$: 60 solutions\n22. $\\{13, 11, 14, 4, 2\\}$: 120 solutions\n23. $\\{13, 9, 16, 0, 0\\}$: 60 solutions\n24. $\\{13, 7, 16, 4, 4\\}$ (60) and $\\{13, 7, 12, 12, 0\\}$ (60): 120 solutions\n25. $\\{13, 3, 18, 2, 0\\}$: 120 solutions\n26. $\\{11, 5, 18, 6, 0\\}$ (120) and $\\{11, 5, 14, 10, 8\\}$ (120): 240 solutions\n27. $\\{11, 1, 16, 8, 8\\}$: 60 solutions\n28. $\\{9, 5, 20, 0, 0\\}$ (60) and $\\{9, 5, 16, 12, 0\\}$ (120): 180 solutions\n29. $\\{9, 3, 20, 4, 0\\}$ (120) and $\\{9, 3, 16, 12, 4\\}$ (120): 240 solutions\n30. $\\{7, 5, 20, 4, 4\\}$ (60) and $\\{7, 5, 12, 12, 12\\}$ (20): 80 solutions\n31. $\\{5, 1, 20, 8, 4\\}$: 120 solutions\n\nSumming the number of solutions from all these sub-cases:\nTotal for Case II = 3360.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of solutions is the sum of the solutions from the two disjoint cases.\nTotal Solutions = (Solutions from Case I) + (Solutions from Case II)\nTotal Solutions = 22260 + 3360 = 25620.\n\n<<<25620>>>"
