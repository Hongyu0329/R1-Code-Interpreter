    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for three specific criteria to be met for each potential candidate:\n1.  **Historical:** The person must be a figure from history, generally understood as existing outside of purely mythological or primordial biblical accounts. This term is often used to refer to the post-biblical era.\n2.  **Saint:** The person must be recognized as a saint by a major Christian tradition.\n3.  **Mentioned by name:** The person's actual name must appear in the text of *Paradise Lost*. Allusions or descriptions are not sufficient.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Context of *Paradise Lost*\nJohn Milton was a 17th-century Puritan with strong anti-Catholic sentiments. His theology emphasized scripture as the sole authority (Sola Scriptura) and viewed the historical development of the Roman Catholic Church—including its hierarchy, rituals, and the veneration of saints and relics—as a corruption of true Christianity. This theological stance makes it inherently unlikely that Milton would name post-biblical, canonized saints in his epic, at least not in a positive or neutral light. The poem's focus is on retelling and interpreting the biblical story of the Fall of Man.\n\n### Step 3: Search the Text of *Paradise Lost*\nThe most likely place to find references to historical figures is in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of future world history.\n\n*   **Old Testament Figures:** Michael's vision includes numerous figures from the Old Testament, such as **Abel**, **Enoch**, **Noah**, **Abraham**, **Moses**, **Joshua**, and **David**. While these individuals are considered saints in some Christian traditions (especially Eastern Orthodoxy), they are primarily **biblical figures**, not \"historical saints\" in the common sense of post-biblical figures. Enoch is sometimes singled out, but he is a pre-Flood patriarch from the Book of Genesis.\n\n*   **New Testament Figures:** The poem describes the life of Jesus, referring to him as \"Messiah,\" \"Saviour,\" and \"Lord.\" His mother is mentioned frequently but is always called \"the Virgin\" or \"Virgin Mother\"; her name, **Mary**, never appears in the text. The apostles are referred to as a group (\"his great Proclamation... by his Apostles sent\"), but none are mentioned by their individual names, such as **Peter**, **Paul**, or **John**.\n\n*   **Post-Biblical Figures:** Milton's description of the Church after the time of the apostles (Book XII, lines 508-537) is a strong polemic against what he saw as its corruption. He speaks of \"grievous wolves\" and men who would \"avail themselves of names, / Places and titles, and with these to join / Secular power.\" This is a critique of the institution that canonizes saints, not a celebration of them. A thorough search for the names of prominent historical saints (such as Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, Francis, Patrick, or George) reveals that **none are mentioned anywhere in the poem**.\n\n*   **Other Historical Figures:** The only non-biblical, historical individual mentioned by name in the poem is **Galileo Galilei**, referred to as the \"Tuscan artist.\" While a major historical figure, he was not a saint; in fact, he was famously persecuted by the Church.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Findings and Conclude\nBased on the analysis, no individual mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost* meets all three criteria of the question.\n\n*   Biblical figures like Enoch and Abraham fail the \"historical\" test in its most common sense (post-biblical).\n*   The Virgin Mary is not mentioned by her name.\n*   The apostles are not mentioned by their individual names.\n*   No canonized, post-biblical saints are named at all.\n\nTherefore, the number of historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost* is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
