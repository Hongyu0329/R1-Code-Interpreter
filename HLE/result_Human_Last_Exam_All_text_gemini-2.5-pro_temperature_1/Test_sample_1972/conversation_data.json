    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for the title of a novel based on two specific pieces of commentary from the writer Jorge Luis Borges.\n    *   **Clue 1 (describing the novel):** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **Clue 2 (describing the author):** The author is \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The first step is to find where Borges made these statements. A search for these quotes reveals they come from a single source: a review Borges wrote. The review was published on November 8, 1946, in the Argentine magazine *El Hogar*, and served as a prologue to the Spanish translation of the novel in question.\n\n3.  **Identify the Author:** The second clue points directly to the author. Borges is comparing a specific writer to the highly influential American novelist William Faulkner. The description of this writer as a \"continuator\" links them to Faulkner's style and themes (often Southern Gothic, complex human psychology), while the parenthetical \"(and simplifier)\" suggests their work is perhaps more accessible or structurally straightforward. The author Borges describes in this manner is **Carson McCullers**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Novel:** The review in which Borges makes these comments is about Carson McCullers' debut novel. He applies the description—\"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"—directly to this book. The novel is **_The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter_**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Verify:**\n    *   Does Borges's review of *The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter* contain both quotes? Yes.\n    *   Does he describe its author, Carson McCullers, as a continuator of Faulkner in that same review? Yes.\n    *   Therefore, both clues point conclusively to the same novel.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Quotes:** The quotes are very precise. The \"tiger\" suggests raw, primal emotion and narrative force, while the \"chess duel\" points to the novel's intricate structure, where the lonely main characters orbit the central deaf-mute character, John Singer, in a series of carefully orchestrated interactions.\n*   **The Faulkner Comparison:** This is a crucial literary clue. Carson McCullers is a prominent figure in the Southern Gothic tradition, just like William Faulkner. Borges's observation that she \"simplifies\" Faulkner is an astute piece of criticism, noting her more direct narrative focus compared to Faulkner's famously complex and fragmented style.\n*   **The Source:** The fact that the quote comes from a prologue/review, rather than a more famous essay or story by Borges, is a key detail. Borges wrote many such pieces, which are a treasure trove of his literary opinions.\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively identify the novel Borges was referring to.\n\n<<<The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter>>>"
