    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to identify the product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n    *   This is a substituted cyclohexane. The leaving group is the bromine atom (-Br) at position C1.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1S, 2R). Let's determine the relative position of the bromo and methyl groups. For substituents at adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) in a cyclohexane ring, (R,R) or (S,S) indicates a `cis` relationship, while (R,S) or (S,R) indicates a `trans` relationship. Here we have (1S, 2R), so the bromo and methyl groups are `trans` to each other.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH).\n    *   Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   The reaction conditions (a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base) strongly favor an E2 elimination mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Conformation of the Substrate**\n\n*   Cyclohexane exists in chair conformations. For a `trans`-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, one substituent must be axial and the other equatorial, or both can be axial, or both can be equatorial. In the chair form, `trans`-1,2 substituents are either axial-axial (a,a) or equatorial-equatorial (e,e). *Correction*: `trans`-1,2 are (axial, axial) or (equatorial, equatorial). No, that's not right. `trans`-1,2 means one is up and one is down. In a chair, up/down can be (axial-up, axial-down) or (equatorial-up, equatorial-down). Let's redraw.\n    *   Let's check `trans`-1,2. If C1 has an axial-up bond, C2 has an axial-down bond. These are `trans`. If C1 has an equatorial-up bond, C2 has an equatorial-down bond. These are also `trans`. So `trans`-1,2 is either diaxial or diequatorial.\n*   Let's reconsider the drawing from R/S.\n    *   (1S, 2R) gives a `trans` relationship. This means the two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring plane.\n*   There are two possible chair conformations for `trans`-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane that are in equilibrium:\n    1.  **Conformer A:** Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n    2.  **Conformer B:** Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n*   **Stability:** The methyl group (-CH3) is bulkier than the bromine atom (-Br). Groups prefer the more spacious equatorial position to minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions). Therefore, Conformer A, with the bulky methyl group in the equatorial position, is significantly more stable and will be the predominant conformation at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Rules of the E2 Reaction**\n\n*   The E2 elimination reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be **trans-diaxial** (both axial, but one pointing up and one pointing down).\n*   The reaction must proceed from a conformation where the leaving group (-Br) is in an axial position. This is Conformer A, which is conveniently the more stable one.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Possible Elimination Pathways**\n\n*   We will analyze the E2 reaction from the reactive conformation: **Conformer A (axial-Br, equatorial-CH3)**.\n*   The leaving group, Br, is on C1 and is axial. We need to find a β-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon, C2 or C6) that is also axial and anti to the Br.\n*   **β-Hydrogen at C2:** The methyl group at C2 is in the equatorial position. This means the hydrogen atom on C2 is in the **axial** position. However, looking at the chair structure, the axial Br at C1 and the axial H at C2 are on the same side of the ring (*syn-periplanar*). They are not anti-periplanar. Therefore, elimination involving the hydrogen at C2 cannot occur.\n*   **β-Hydrogen at C6:** Carbon C6 has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1 (they are in a trans-diaxial arrangement).\n*   **Conclusion:** The base (tert-butoxide) can only abstract the axial proton from C6.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\n\n*   Since the elimination can only happen by removing a proton from C6, a double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group on C2 remains untouched.\n*   When naming the resulting alkene, the ring is numbered starting from the double bond in a way that gives the substituent the lowest possible number. If we number the double bond as C1=C2, the methyl group would be on C3.\n*   The constitutional isomer formed is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Correctly identified as E2.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Reactant:** Correctly identified `trans` relationship from (1S, 2R).\n*   **Conformational Analysis:** Correctly identified the more stable conformer (equatorial methyl).\n*   **E2 Stereochemical Requirement:** Correctly applied the trans-diaxial rule.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** Noted that stereochemistry is the deciding factor, overriding typical Zaitsev/Hofmann rules, although the result aligns with the Hofmann-like product expected from a bulky base.\n*   **Product Identification:** Correctly identified the position of the new double bond and the final structure.\n*   **Product Naming:** Correctly named the product based on IUPAC rules.\n\nFinal Answer: The reaction is a stereospecific E2 elimination. The only available anti-periplanar beta-hydrogen is on C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The product is named 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
