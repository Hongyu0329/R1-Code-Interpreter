    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** Let's break down the question into its key components:\n    *   **Subject:** A physicist.\n    *   **Primary Field:** Better known for work in microscopy.\n    *   **Discovery:** An optical effect related to real imagery.\n    *   **Origin of Discovery:** An accidental observation by a custodial worker (or laboratory assistant).\n    *   **Context of Observation:** The worker was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Anecdote:** The most specific and unusual clue is the story of the discovery being initiated by a custodial worker. This is a well-known, though perhaps slightly embellished, story in the history of physics. This story is tied to the development of focusing X-ray optics.\n\n3.  **Identify the Optical Effect and its Application:** X-rays are very difficult to focus. Unlike visible light, they pass straight through conventional lenses and are not easily reflected by mirrors at normal angles. The discovery was that X-rays *can* be effectively reflected if they strike a very smooth mirror surface at a very shallow, or \"grazing,\" angle. By using a curved (concave) mirror, one can focus these reflected X-rays to form a real image. This principle is the foundation of X-ray microscopy and X-ray telescopes.\n\n4.  **Identify the Physicists:** The physicists who pioneered this technique in the late 1940s at Stanford University are **Paul Kirkpatrick** and **Albert Baez**. They developed a system using two perpendicular, cylindrically curved mirrors to focus X-rays to a single point. This system is now famously known as the **Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) mirror system**.\n\n5.  **Connect the Clues to the Physicists:**\n    *   **Physicist:** Both Paul Kirkpatrick and Albert Baez were physicists.\n    *   **Microscopy:** Their work was fundamental to the creation of the first practical X-ray microscopes. Thus, they are both known for their work in the microscopy field.\n    *   **Optical Effect/Real Imagery:** The grazing incidence reflection they utilized allows for the formation of real images with X-rays.\n    *   **Custodian Story:** Albert Baez, in particular, often recounted that the initial idea came from observing an oddly clear but distorted reflection of a light bulb filament seen by a lab assistant polishing a long, slightly curved piece of metal (acting as a one-dimensional concave mirror).\n\n6.  **Select the Final Answer:** The question asks for \"Which physicist...\". Both Kirkpatrick and Baez are correct answers as they were co-discoverers. However, **Paul Kirkpatrick** was the senior professor at Stanford leading the research, and his career is arguably more singularly focused on the development of X-ray optics and microscopy. He is a very precise answer to the question. Albert Baez is also a correct answer, but Kirkpatrick as the senior researcher is often cited. Given the phrasing, either name is valid, but Paul Kirkpatrick is a definitive fit for all criteria.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The \"Custodian\":** The role of the person who made the observation is sometimes described as a custodian, a janitor, a mechanic, or a laboratory assistant. The core of the story remains the same: it was an accidental observation by a non-physicist that sparked the idea.\n*   **\"Concave Mirrors\":** The initial observation involved a long, slightly bent pipe or metal sheet, which acts as a concave mirror, but only in one dimension (a cylindrical mirror). The Kirkpatrick-Baez system uses two such mirrors oriented at 90 degrees to each other to achieve two-dimensional focusing.\n*   **Singular vs. Plural:** The question asks for a single \"physicist,\" even though the discovery was a collaboration. In such cases, citing the senior researcher or either of the co-discoverers is typically acceptable.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the physicist in question is Paul Kirkpatrick.\n\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"
