    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a classical ballet step from the given options where the final leg position (specifically, which foot is in front in fifth position) is identical to the initial leg position.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually begins in fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n    *   **Execution:** This is a jump from two feet where the legs beat six times (which corresponds to three changes of position in the air). The sequence of leg positions is: open, beat back, open, beat front, open, land.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in fifth position, but because there is an odd number of changes (three), the feet will have switched places. If the dancer started with the right foot in front, they will land with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n    *   **Execution:** `Échappé` means \"to escape,\" so the dancer jumps from fifth to an open second position. `Battu` means \"beaten,\" indicating the legs beat together as they close from second position. `Changé` means \"changed,\" which explicitly states that the feet will change their front/back relationship.\n    *   **Ending Position:** After jumping from second position, the legs beat and close back into fifth position with the opposite foot in front. If the dancer started with the right foot front, they will land with the left foot front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different, as indicated by the term `changé`.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically starts from fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n    *   **Execution:** The name `assemblé` means \"to assemble.\" The dancer slides one foot (e.g., the front foot, right) out to the side, then jumps off the supporting foot (left). In the air, both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") to land simultaneously on both feet in fifth position. In a standard `assemblé` (like an `assemblé côté`), the feet return to their original configuration.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in fifth position with the same foot in front. If they started with the right foot front and brushed that foot to the side, they will land with the right foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same. (Note: While there are versions like `assemblé changé`, the fundamental `assemblé` does not change feet.)\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n    *   **Execution:** `Glissade` means \"to glide,\" and `derrière` means \"behind.\" The dancer glides the back foot (left) out to the side, transfers weight, and then the other foot (right) closes *behind* the new supporting foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Because the original front foot closes to the back, the feet have swapped positions. The dancer ends in fifth position with the left foot now in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative jump similar to a `pas de chat`, but with a circular movement (`rond de jambe`) from each leg in the air. The dancer typically lands on the first leg, and the second leg closes behind it.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The sequence of the movement and landing causes the feet to change. The dancer will land in fifth position with the opposite foot (left) in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\nAfter analyzing all the options, the `assemblé` is the only step where the standard execution results in the dancer landing in the exact same fifth position from which they started. The other steps, either by name (`changé`) or by their fundamental mechanics (`derrière`, entrechat beat count, `gargouillade` landing), all involve changing the front foot.\n\n<<<C>>>"
