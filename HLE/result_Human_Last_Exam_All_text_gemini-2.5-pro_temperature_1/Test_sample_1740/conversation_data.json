    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question and its terms.**\nThe question asks for the number of \"members\" of the \"let-7 family\" in \"humans\".\n*   **let-7 family:** This is a well-known family of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. The family is defined by a shared, conserved \"seed sequence\".\n*   **Humans:** The organism is specified as *Homo sapiens*.\n*   **Members:** This term can be slightly ambiguous. It could refer to:\n    1.  The number of distinct mature miRNA sequences (e.g., let-7a, let-7b are distinct members).\n    2.  The number of genes (precursor miRNAs) that encode these mature miRNAs. Since some mature miRNAs are encoded by multiple genes, this number can be higher.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the canonical members of the human let-7 family.**\nThe core, widely accepted members of the human let-7 family are named let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, and let-7i. Note that let-7h is found in other organisms but not in primates, including humans. Additionally, another miRNA, miR-98, shares the same seed sequence and is considered a bona fide member of the let-7 family.\n\nThis gives us 9 functionally distinct types of mature miRNAs in the family:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n9.  miR-98\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of genes that encode these miRNAs.**\nTo get the full picture of the family's genetic representation, we must count the number of distinct gene loci that produce these miRNAs. Some of the mature let-7 miRNAs are encoded by more than one gene located at different places in the human genome. We can find this information in authoritative miRNA databases like miRBase.\n\n*   **let-7a:** is encoded by three separate genes (`let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`).\n*   **let-7f:** is encoded by two separate genes (`let-7f-1`, `let-7f-2`).\n*   **let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98:** are each encoded by a single gene.\n\n**Step 4: Tally the total number of genes.**\nLet's sum the number of genes for each member:\n*   Genes for let-7a: 3\n*   Genes for let-7f: 2\n*   Genes for let-7b: 1\n*   Genes for let-7c: 1\n*   Genes for let-7d: 1\n*   Genes for let-7e: 1\n*   Genes for let-7g: 1\n*   Genes for let-7i: 1\n*   Genes for miR-98: 1\n\nTotal number of genes = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **12**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of \"Member\":** The key point of caution is the definition of \"member\". While there are 9 distinct mature miRNA paralogs, they originate from 12 distinct genetic loci (genes). In scientific literature, it is common to refer to the number of genes when discussing the size of a miRNA family, as it reflects the genetic complexity and regulatory potential.\n2.  **Family Composition:** Ensure you are using the canonical definition of the let-7 family, which includes let-7a/b/c/d/e/f/g/i and miR-98 for humans.\n3.  **Data Source:** This information is based on the consensus from established genomic and miRNA databases (like miRBase) and is widely cited in scientific review articles.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile there are 9 distinct mature let-7 family miRNA types, they are encoded by a total of 12 different genes in the human genome. The most comprehensive and commonly cited answer for the number of members in the human let-7 family is the count of its genes.\n\n<<<12>>>"
