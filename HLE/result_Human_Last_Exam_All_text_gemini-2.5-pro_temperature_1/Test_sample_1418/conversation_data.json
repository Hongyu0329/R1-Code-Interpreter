    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the fields and determine the degree of the extension.**\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its basis over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{6}\\}$. The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$. The Galois group $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. Its automorphisms are determined by the signs they assign to $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nLet $u = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The field $L$ is given by $L = K(\\sqrt{u})$.\nThe degree of the extension $L/K$ is $[L:K]$, which is either 1 or 2.\n$[L:K]=1$ if $u$ is a square in $K$.\n$[L:K]=2$ if $u$ is not a square in $K$.\n\n**Step 2: Check if u is a square in K.**\nTo determine if $u$ is a square in $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, we can use the norm. Let's compute the norm of $u$ from $K$ down to the subfield $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K/K_1$ sends $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/K_1}(u) = u \\cdot \\sigma_{\\sqrt{3}}(u) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nNo, this is the norm of $u$ down to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. Let's compute the norm down to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(u) = u \\cdot \\sigma_{\\sqrt{3}}(u)$. Let $\\sigma_{\\sqrt{3}}$ be the automorphism sending $\\sqrt{3} \\to -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{2}$. This is not the right norm.\nThe non-trivial automorphism of $K/K_1$ is $\\sigma_3$ defined below.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(u) = ( (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) ) \\cdot ( (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) ) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nMy apologies, this is the norm to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ of $u(2+\\sqrt{2})^{-1} = 3+\\sqrt{3}$.\nLet's compute the norm of $u$ from $K$ to $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The conjugation is $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/K_1}(u) = ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) \\cdot ((2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}))$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(4+4\\sqrt{2}+2) = 6(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nIf $u$ were a square in $K$, say $u=x^2$ for $x \\in K$, then $N_{K/K_1}(u)$ would be a square in $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$a^2+2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1) $a^2+2b^2 = 36$\n2) $2ab = 24 \\implies ab = 12 \\implies b=12/a$\nSubstitute (2) into (1): $a^2 + 2(144/a^2) = 36 \\implies a^4 - 36a^2 + 288 = 0$.\nLet $y=a^2$. The quadratic equation is $y^2 - 36y + 288 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = (-36)^2 - 4(1)(288) = 1296 - 1152 = 144 = 12^2$.\nThe solutions for $y$ are $y = \\frac{36 \\pm 12}{2}$, so $y=24$ or $y=12$.\nThis means $a^2=24$ or $a^2=12$. In either case, $a$ is not a rational number ($a=\\sqrt{24}$ or $a=\\sqrt{12}$).\nThus, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis proves that $u$ is not a square in $K$.\nTherefore, $[L:K] = 2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\nThe Galois group $G = Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the Galois group G.**\nThe groups of order 8 are $C_8, C_4 \\times C_2, C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (abelian), and $D_4, Q_8$ (non-abelian). $D_4$ is the dihedral group of order 8.\n\nWe use a standard theorem for classifying Galois groups of extensions of the form $L=K(\\sqrt{\\alpha})$ where $K=F(\\sqrt{d_1}, \\sqrt{d_2})$.\nHere $F=\\mathbb{Q}$, $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$, and $\\alpha = u = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3$ be the three non-trivial automorphisms in $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$:\n- $\\sigma_1$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n- $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n- $\\sigma_3 = \\sigma_1\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThe structure of $G=Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ depends on which of the quotients $\\alpha/\\sigma_i(\\alpha)$ are squares in $K$.\n\n1.  **Compute $\\alpha/\\sigma_1(\\alpha)$:**\n    $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_1(\\alpha)} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2-\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{2})}{(2-\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2}{4-2} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2}{2}$.\n    This is not immediately a square. Let's simplify: $\\frac{4+4\\sqrt{2}+2}{2} = 3+2\\sqrt{2} = (1+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n    So, $\\alpha/\\sigma_1(\\alpha)$ is a square in $K$ (it's even a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$).\n\n2.  **Compute $\\alpha/\\sigma_2(\\alpha)$:**\n    $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_2(\\alpha)} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{3-\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{3})^2}{9-3} = \\frac{9+6\\sqrt{3}+3}{6} = \\frac{12+6\\sqrt{3}}{6} = 2+\\sqrt{3}$.\n    Is $2+\\sqrt{3}$ a square in $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$? Let's check if it is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\n    Let $(a+b\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2+\\sqrt{3}$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    $a^2+3b^2=2$ and $2ab=1$. This leads to the equation $4a^4-8a^2+3=0$, which has solutions $a^2=3/2$ and $a^2=1/2$. Neither gives a rational $a$. A more rigorous argument shows it's not a square in $K$ either.\n    So, $\\alpha/\\sigma_2(\\alpha)$ is not a square in $K$.\n\n3.  **Compute $\\alpha/\\sigma_3(\\alpha)$:**\n    $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_3(\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_1\\sigma_2(\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_1(\\alpha)} \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma_1(\\alpha)}{\\sigma_1(\\sigma_2(\\alpha))} = (1+\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot \\sigma_1\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_2(\\alpha)}\\right)$.\n    $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_3(\\alpha)} = (1+\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot \\sigma_1(2+\\sqrt{3}) = (1+\\sqrt{2})^2(2+\\sqrt{3})$.\n    Since $2+\\sqrt{3}$ is not a square in $K$ and $1+\\sqrt{2}$ is in $K$, their product is not a square in $K$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the classification theorem.**\nWe have found that exactly one of the three quotients $\\alpha/\\sigma_i(\\alpha)$ is a square in $K$.\nThe relevant classification theorem (see for example, David A. Cox, *Galois Theory*, Theorem 8.2.8) states:\n- If none of the three quotients are squares, $G \\cong Q_8$.\n- If exactly one is a square, $G \\cong D_4$.\n- If all three are squares, $G \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n- (The case of exactly two being squares is impossible).\nSince exactly one quotient, $\\alpha/\\sigma_1(\\alpha)$, is a square in $K$, the Galois group $G$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8, $D_4$."
