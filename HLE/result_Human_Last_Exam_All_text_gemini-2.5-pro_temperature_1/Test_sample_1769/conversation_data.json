    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Current Word and its Origin:**\n    The Modern English word is \"sister\". Etymological research confirms that this word was borrowed into Middle English from the Old Norse word `systir`. This borrowing replaced the native Old English word due to the extensive contact and settlement of Norse-speaking Vikings in England. This confirms the premise of the question: our current word is a direct result of the historical interaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the Original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) Word:**\n    Before the Norse invasions, the Anglo-Saxons had their own word for \"sister\". This word was `sweostor`. It descended from the Proto-Germanic `*swestēr`, which is also the ancestor of the Old Norse `systir`, German `Schwester`, and Dutch `zuster`. Our task is to trace how this native word, `sweostor`, would have likely evolved into Modern English if it had not been replaced.\n\n3.  **Trace the Evolution from Old English to Middle English:**\n    The period between Old and Middle English saw significant changes in pronunciation and spelling.\n    *   **Old English:** `sweostor` (pronounced roughly /ˈswe͜ostor/).\n    *   **Simplification:** The initial consonant cluster `sw-` was sometimes simplified to `s-` before a vowel. A similar change can be seen in Old English `swilc` becoming `such`.\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The diphthong `eo` in `sweostor` and the `o` in the unstressed second syllable underwent changes. In many dialects, particularly the influential dialects of the South and Midlands, `sweostor` simplified to `suster`.\n    *   **Historical Evidence:** This form, `suster`, is not just a theoretical possibility; it is widely found in Middle English texts. For example, Geoffrey Chaucer, a key figure in the development of the English literary standard, frequently used \"suster\" in *The Canterbury Tales*. The Wycliffe Bible also uses \"suster\". This indicates that `suster` was the dominant native form in the dialect that would eventually form the basis of Modern Standard English. An alternative form, `swester`, also existed, primarily in northern dialects, but `suster` had the stronger position in the south.\n\n4.  **Trace the Evolution from Middle English to Modern English:**\n    Assuming `suster` had become the standard form by the end of the Middle English period, we must apply the subsequent sound changes that led to Modern English.\n    *   **The Great Vowel Shift:** This major sound change primarily affected long vowels, so it would not have directly altered the short 'u' in `suster` (pronounced with a /u/ sound like in \"put\").\n    *   **The \"STRUT-split\":** A crucial change that did affect this word is the unrounding of the short 'u' vowel. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the short /u/ sound evolved into the /ʌ/ sound (the \"uh\" sound in \"cup\" or \"strut\") in most environments. We see this in many common words:\n        *   Old English `sunu` → Middle English `sone` → Modern English `son` (/sʌn/)\n        *   Old English `cuman` → Middle English `comen` → Modern English `come` (/kʌm/)\n        *   Middle English `butere` → Modern English `butter` (/ˈbʌtər/)\n    *   **Applying the change:** Following this exact pattern, the Middle English `suster` (pronounced /ˈsustər/) would have naturally evolved to be pronounced /ˈsʌstər/ in Modern English.\n\n5.  **Determine the Modern Spelling:**\n    The spelling would likely have remained `suster`, similar to how words like `butter`, `rudder`, and `summer` kept their 'u' spelling despite the change in pronunciation. Therefore, the modern word would be spelled `suster` and pronounced to rhyme with \"buster\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Counterfactual Nature:** This is a \"what if\" scenario in historical linguistics. The answer is a projection based on known linguistic patterns, not an absolute certainty.\n*   **Dialectal Variation:** English has always had significant dialectal differences. The form `swester` (closer to the German `Schwester`) was a strong contender in northern England. However, the question asks for \"the\" Modern English word, which implies the standard form, largely derived from the London and Southeast Midland dialects where `suster` was prevalent.\n*   **The Power of Simplicity:** The actual replacement of `sweostor`/`suster` by the Norse `systir` is often attributed to the phonetic simplicity of the Norse word, making it easier to use in a mixed-language environment. Without this competition, the native form `suster` would have had no rival.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nFollowing the natural path of linguistic evolution from Old English, and removing the historical influence of the Norse language, the native word `sweostor` would have simplified to `suster` in Middle English. This form then would have undergone the standard English sound change that turned the short 'u' sound into the modern 'uh' sound (/ʌ/).\n\n<<<suster>>>"
