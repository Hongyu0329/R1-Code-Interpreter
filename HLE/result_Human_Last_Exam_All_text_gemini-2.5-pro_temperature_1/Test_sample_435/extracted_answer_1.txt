Based on its role in promoting T cell survival, proliferation, and the generation of a less-differentiated and more potent memory phenotype, interleukin-15 would be predicted to **increase** the release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) in CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation when compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
