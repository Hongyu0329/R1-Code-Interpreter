    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A ballet term meaning \"bent backwards.\" It is a backbend performed from the waist, with the body bending directly backward.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet technique developed by Agrippina Vaganova. It is known for its precision, emphasis on core strength, clean lines, and a holistic approach where every part of the body works in harmony. It prioritizes safety and building strength correctly.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** A ballet style developed by choreographer George Balanchine. It is characterized by speed, musicality, extended lines, and a neoclassical aesthetic. It often pushes the boundaries of classical technique for artistic and dynamic effect.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Initiation:** The bend initiates from the upper back (thoracic spine). The dancer lifts the chest towards the ceiling first, then begins to arch back.\n*   **Hips:** This is a crucial point. To maintain stability and support the lower back, the hips are pushed slightly **forward** as a counterbalance to the upper body bending back. The weight remains centered over the balls of the feet. This creates a long, continuous, elegant curve from the knees through the torso.\n*   **Core and Back:** The lower back is supported and elongated, not crunched. The focus is on flexibility in the upper and middle spine.\n*   **Head:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back, but is not simply dropped. It is an active and elegant extension.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Initiation:** The movement can be quicker and more dramatic.\n*   **Hips:** This is the key distinguishing feature. In the Balanchine style, the hips are often pushed **backwards**. This creates a very different visual line, often described as a \"broken\" or hinged look at the hip.\n*   **Aesthetic:** This hip-back position creates a more extreme and dynamic angle. It aligns with Balanchine's preference for off-balance poses and angular lines. It is a stylistic choice that emphasizes visual effect over the anatomical purity of the Vaganova method.\n*   **Head:** The head may be released back more fully.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Two and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While arm placement (port de bras) is styled differently in each method, the most fundamental and defining difference in the *mechanics of the torso and hips* is not the arms.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the primary and most cited difference. Vaganova: hips forward. Balanchine: hips back. This single change alters the entire line, balance, and muscular engagement of the movement.\n*   **C. Speed:** Balanchine's work is generally faster, but a cambré can be done at any speed in either technique depending on the exercise. Speed is a quality of performance, not a defining technical difference of the position itself.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The depth of the backbend depends more on the individual dancer's flexibility than the method. The Balanchine position *may appear* deeper because of the hip angle, but the fundamental difference is *how* the pose is achieved, not *how far* it goes.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement is a consequence of the overall body position. The primary driver of the difference in the pose is the action of the hips and torso, which then dictates where the head goes.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most significant and technically defining difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova method and the Balanchine method is the opposition created by the placement of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
