    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Count the Total Number of Edge Squares**\n*   A standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total.\n*   The edge squares are those in the first and last rows (ranks 1 and 8) and the first and last columns (files 'a' and 'h').\n*   There are 8 squares on rank 1, 8 on rank 8, 8 on file 'a', and 8 on file 'h'.\n*   To find the total number of unique edge squares, we sum the squares on each side and subtract the 4 corner squares that are counted twice: (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28.\n*   So, there are 28 edge squares available for placing bishops.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Constraint of Bishop Placement**\n*   The main rule is that no two bishops can attack each other.\n*   Bishops attack along diagonals.\n*   A crucial property of bishops is that they are color-bound; a bishop on a white square can only ever move to and attack other white squares, and the same is true for black squares.\n*   This means we can solve the problem for white squares and black squares independently and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Placement on White Edge Squares**\n*   First, we determine how many of the 28 edge squares are white. The colors on the edge are perfectly balanced. Therefore, there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n*   Let's analyze the diagonals for the 14 white edge squares. We'll find that every white edge square shares a diagonal with exactly one other white edge square.\n    *   For example, the corner square h1 is on the same diagonal as corner square a8.\n    *   The square f1 is on the same diagonal as h3.\n    *   The square d1 is on the same diagonal as h5.\n    *   This pattern continues for all 14 white edge squares, forming 7 distinct pairs.\n*   Since two bishops on the same diagonal would attack each other, you can only place one bishop within each of these 7 pairs.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops you can place on the 14 white edge squares is 7.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Placement on Black Edge Squares**\n*   The logic is identical for the 14 black edge squares.\n*   Every black edge square shares a diagonal with exactly one other black edge square.\n    *   For example, corner a1 is on the same diagonal as corner h8.\n    *   Square c1 is on the same diagonal as h6.\n*   This creates 7 pairs of black edge squares.\n*   You can only place one bishop per pair to avoid them attacking each other.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops you can place on the 14 black edge squares is also 7.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Result**\n*   The maximum number of bishops that can be placed on all edge squares is the sum of the maximums for each color: 7 (on white) + 7 (on black) = 14 bishops.\n*   The problem asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops.\n*   Total edge squares = 28.\n*   Maximum bishops placed = 14.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Maximum bishops placed.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
