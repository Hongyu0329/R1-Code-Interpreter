    "This analysis will break down the question, identify the key constraints, and then deduce the two problems that arise for the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge under these specific conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Premise**\n\n*   **Definition of Knowledge:** The problem starts with the standard JTB definition: Knowledge is a Justified True Belief. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is True (the Truth condition).\n    2.  S believes P (the Belief condition).\n    3.  S is justified in believing P (the Justification condition).\n*   **Core Constraint:** The most important part of the question is the artificial limit placed on epistemology: \"our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief\". This means that for any proposition, a person can either be in a state of Knowing it or in a state of Believing it.\n*   **Exclusion:** We are explicitly told to ignore Gettier problems, which are the most famous objections to the JTB theory. This forces us to look for other, more fundamental issues that arise from the given constraints.\n\n**2. Identify Potential Areas of Conflict**\n\nThe conflict will arise where the JTB definition interacts with the strict, two-state (Knowledge/Belief) constraint. Let's examine the JTB conditions in light of this constraint.\n\n*   **Belief Condition:** JTB states that knowledge *is a kind of* belief. This implies that the set of things you know is a subset of the things you believe.\n*   **Justification Condition:** JTB requires justification. Justification is usually based on other beliefs or evidence. The question is, what is the epistemic state of these justifying beliefs/evidence?\n\nThis leads us to the two primary problems.\n\n---\n\n### Careful Points and Step-by-Step Derivation of the Problems\n\n#### Problem 1: The Circularity of Justification\n\n1.  **The Role of Justification:** The 'J' in JTB is what separates knowledge from a lucky guess that happens to be true. Justification requires having good reasons or evidence for one's belief.\n2.  **The Source of Justification:** These \"good reasons\" are typically other propositions. For example, my justification for believing \"It is raining\" might be the proposition \"I see water falling from the sky outside my window.\"\n3.  **Applying the Constraint:** According to the problem's constraint, my epistemic state regarding this justifying proposition (\"I see water...\") must be either **Knowledge** or **Belief**.\n4.  **Analyzing the Options:**\n    *   **Option A: Justification is a Belief.** If my justification for P is just another *belief* Q, then the justification is weak. What if belief Q is false, or itself unjustified? Then it can't serve as a solid foundation to turn my belief P into knowledge. This would defeat the purpose of the justification condition.\n    *   **Option B: Justification is Knowledge.** To provide a firm foundation, the justifying proposition Q must be something I *know*. This seems much more plausible. My justification for P is that I *know* Q.\n5.  **The Inevitable Conclusion (Circularity):** If robust justification requires prior knowledge, then the JTB definition becomes circular.\n    *   To **Know** P, you must have a Justified Belief in P.\n    *   To be Justified, you must base your belief on another proposition, Q, which you **Know**.\n    *   Therefore, the definition of **Knowledge** relies on already having **Knowledge**. You are defining a concept using the concept itself, which is a logical fallacy (circular definition).\n\n#### Problem 2: The Contradictory Status of Belief and Knowledge\n\n1.  **The Relationship in JTB:** As defined, knowledge is a *type* of belief. Specifically, it is a belief that has the additional properties of being true and justified. This means if you are in a state of Knowledge, you are necessarily also in a state of Belief.\n2.  **The Relationship in the Constraint:** The prompt establishes that \"our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief\". The phrasing strongly implies that these are two distinct, mutually exclusive categories. For any given proposition, you are either in one state or the other, but not both.\n3.  **The Direct Contradiction:** We now have two conflicting models for the relationship between Knowledge and Belief.\n    *   **JTB says:** Knowledge is a subset of Belief (K ⊂ B).\n    *   **The constraint implies:** Knowledge and Belief are mutually exclusive sets (K ∩ B = ∅).\n4.  **The Consequence (Impossibility):** Under the problem's constraint, the JTB definition becomes impossible to satisfy. To attain the state of **Knowledge**, one of the necessary conditions to meet is **Belief**. However, as soon as you meet the Belief condition, you are, by the rule of the constraint, put into the **Belief** state. Since the states are mutually exclusive, being in the Belief state prevents you from being in the Knowledge state. Therefore, knowledge is defined in a self-contradictory way that makes it an unattainable state.\n\n---\nThe final answer is a concise summary of these two points.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems the JTB definition runs into under these constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Circularity of Justification:** The JTB model requires a belief to be justified to count as knowledge. Under the constraint that epistemic states are only Knowledge or Belief, a proper justification for a proposition (P) must be based on other propositions (Q, R, etc.) that are already *Known*. If they were merely *Believed*, they would provide a weak and potentially false foundation, failing to adequately justify P. This requirement means that to gain Knowledge, one must already possess other Knowledge, making the definition of knowledge circular (i.e., defining knowledge in terms of itself).\n\n2.  **The Contradiction between States:** The JTB model defines knowledge as a specific *type* of belief (one that is true and justified). This means that if you know something, you must also believe it. However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the *only two available epistemic states* implies they are distinct and mutually exclusive categories. This creates a contradiction: to satisfy the definition of Knowledge, you must first have a Belief. But according to the constraint, if you are in the state of Belief, you cannot simultaneously be in the state of Knowledge. Thus, the JTB definition becomes self-contradictory and knowledge becomes an impossible state to achieve.>>>"
