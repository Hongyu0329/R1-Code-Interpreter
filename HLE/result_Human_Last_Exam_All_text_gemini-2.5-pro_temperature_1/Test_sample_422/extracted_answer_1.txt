The two problems the JTB definition runs into under these constraints are:

1.  **The Circularity of Justification:** The JTB model requires a belief to be justified to count as knowledge. Under the constraint that epistemic states are only Knowledge or Belief, a proper justification for a proposition (P) must be based on other propositions (Q, R, etc.) that are already *Known*. If they were merely *Believed*, they would provide a weak and potentially false foundation, failing to adequately justify P. This requirement means that to gain Knowledge, one must already possess other Knowledge, making the definition of knowledge circular (i.e., defining knowledge in terms of itself).

2.  **The Contradiction between States:** The JTB model defines knowledge as a specific *type* of belief (one that is true and justified). This means that if you know something, you must also believe it. However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the *only two available epistemic states* implies they are distinct and mutually exclusive categories. This creates a contradiction: to satisfy the definition of Knowledge, you must first have a Belief. But according to the constraint, if you are in the state of Belief, you cannot simultaneously be in the state of Knowledge. Thus, the JTB definition becomes self-contradictory and knowledge becomes an impossible state to achieve.
