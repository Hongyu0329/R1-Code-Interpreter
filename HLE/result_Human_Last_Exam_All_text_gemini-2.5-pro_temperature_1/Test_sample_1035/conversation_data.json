    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite subgraphs that cover all edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Question:**\n    Let $K_n$ be the complete graph on $n$ vertices. We are looking for a family of bipartite graphs, $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k$, such that every edge of $K_n$ is an edge in at least one of these $G_i$. The vertices of each $G_i$ are a subset of the vertices of $K_n$. The question asks for the minimum possible value of the sum of the number of vertices of the graphs in the family, i.e., $\\min \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$. This is a well-studied problem in extremal graph theory. Let's denote this minimum value by $f(n)$. We need to find $f(35)$.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Relevant Theorem:**\n    This problem was solved exactly by Zoltán Füredi, André E. Kézdy, and Attila Sali in their 1995 paper \"On the minimal number of vertices of a bipartite graph covering Kn\". They provide a formula for $f(n)$. The formula depends on two parameters, $m$ and $t$, which are determined by $n$.\n\n3.  **The Formula:**\n    The minimum value $f(n)$ is given by:\n    $f(n) = \\min_{m} \\left\\{ n(m-t) + \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} i \\binom{m}{i} \\right\\}$\n    where $t = \\lfloor m/2 \\rfloor$, and the minimum is taken over all integers $m$ that satisfy the condition:\n    $n \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{t} \\binom{m}{i}$\n\n4.  **Applying the Formula for n = 35:**\n    We need to find the values of $m$ that satisfy the condition for $n=35$.\n    The condition is: $35 \\le \\sum_{i=0}^{\\lfloor m/2 \\rfloor} \\binom{m}{i}$.\n\n    Let's check for small values of $m$:\n    *   **m=1, t=0:** $\\sum_{i=0}^0 \\binom{1}{i} = \\binom{1}{0} = 1$.  ($35 \\not\\le 1$)\n    *   **m=2, t=1:** $\\sum_{i=0}^1 \\binom{2}{i} = \\binom{2}{0} + \\binom{2}{1} = 1 + 2 = 3$. ($35 \\not\\le 3$)\n    *   **m=3, t=1:** $\\sum_{i=0}^1 \\binom{3}{i} = \\binom{3}{0} + \\binom{3}{1} = 1 + 3 = 4$. ($35 \\not\\le 4$)\n    *   **m=4, t=2:** $\\sum_{i=0}^2 \\binom{4}{i} = \\binom{4}{0} + \\binom{4}{1} + \\binom{4}{2} = 1 + 4 + 6 = 11$. ($35 \\not\\le 11$)\n    *   **m=5, t=2:** $\\sum_{i=0}^2 \\binom{5}{i} = \\binom{5}{0} + \\binom{5}{1} + \\binom{5}{2} = 1 + 5 + 10 = 16$. ($35 \\not\\le 16$)\n    *   **m=6, t=3:** $\\sum_{i=0}^3 \\binom{6}{i} = \\binom{6}{0} + \\binom{6}{1} + \\binom{6}{2} + \\binom{6}{3} = 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 = 42$.\n        Since $35 \\le 42$, $m=6$ is a valid value. The range of valid $m$ starts at $m=6$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Value for Valid m:**\n    We need to compute the value of the expression for valid $m$ and find the minimum. Let's call the expression $g(m)$.\n    $g(m) = n(m-t) + \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} i \\binom{m}{i}$.\n\n    *   **For m = 6 (t=3):**\n        $g(6) = 35(6-3) + \\sum_{i=0}^{2} i \\binom{6}{i}$\n        $g(6) = 35 \\cdot 3 + \\left(0 \\cdot \\binom{6}{0} + 1 \\cdot \\binom{6}{1} + 2 \\cdot \\binom{6}{2}\\right)$\n        $g(6) = 105 + (0 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 6 + 2 \\cdot 15)$\n        $g(6) = 105 + (0 + 6 + 30)$\n        $g(6) = 105 + 36 = 141$.\n\n    *   **For m = 7 (t=3):**\n        The condition $35 \\le \\sum_{i=0}^3 \\binom{7}{i} = 1+7+21+35 = 64$ is satisfied.\n        $g(7) = 35(7-3) + \\sum_{i=0}^{2} i \\binom{7}{i}$\n        $g(7) = 35 \\cdot 4 + \\left(0 \\cdot \\binom{7}{0} + 1 \\cdot \\binom{7}{1} + 2 \\cdot \\binom{7}{2}\\right)$\n        $g(7) = 140 + (0 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 7 + 2 \\cdot 21)$\n        $g(7) = 140 + (0 + 7 + 42)$\n        $g(7) = 140 + 49 = 189$.\n\n    *   **For m = 8 (t=4):**\n        The condition $35 \\le \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\binom{8}{i} = 1+8+28+56+70 = 163$ is satisfied.\n        $g(8) = 35(8-4) + \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\binom{8}{i}$\n        $g(8) = 35 \\cdot 4 + \\left(1 \\cdot \\binom{8}{1} + 2 \\cdot \\binom{8}{2} + 3 \\cdot \\binom{8}{3}\\right)$\n        $g(8) = 140 + (1 \\cdot 8 + 2 \\cdot 28 + 3 \\cdot 56)$\n        $g(8) = 140 + (8 + 56 + 168) = 140 + 232 = 372$.\n\n6.  **Finding the Minimum:**\n    The calculated values are $g(6)=141$, $g(7)=189$, $g(8)=372$. The function $g(m)$ is increasing for $m \\ge 6$. Therefore, the minimum value is achieved at the smallest possible value of $m$, which is $m=6$.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices is 141."
