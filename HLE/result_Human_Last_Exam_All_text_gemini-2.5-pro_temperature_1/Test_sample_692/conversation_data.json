    "The question asks for the earliest known specific date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization using its own writing system. This requires analyzing various artifacts from different cultures and understanding their dating systems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to a specific point in time (day, month, year) that can be correlated with our modern calendar, not just the oldest artifact with writing on it.\n    *   **\"pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n    *   **\"aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be inscribed using a native script, such as Maya hieroglyphs or Epi-Olmec script.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Civilizations and Writing Systems:**\n    The most advanced and earliest writing systems capable of recording specific dates were developed in Mesoamerica.\n    *   **Olmec/Epi-Olmec:** The Olmecs are credited with the earliest writing in the Americas (the Cascajal Block), and their successors, the Epi-Olmec, used a script that included dates from the Long Count calendar.\n    *   **Zapotec:** The Zapotecs at Monte Albán developed an early writing system and recorded calendrical information.\n    *   **Maya:** The Maya are famous for their sophisticated hieroglyphic writing and extensive use of the Long Count calendar, but their earliest known recorded dates are later than those of the Epi-Olmec.\n\n3.  **Analyze Key Artifacts and \"Careful Points\":**\n\n    *   **The Cascajal Block:**\n        *   **Description:** An Olmec serpentine block dated to circa 900 BCE.\n        *   **Analysis:** This contains the *oldest known writing* from the Americas.\n        *   **Careful Point:** However, the script is undeciphered, and it does not contain a recognizable calendrical date. Therefore, it is the oldest writing, but not the oldest *recorded date*.\n\n    *   **Zapotec Monuments at Monte Albán:**\n        *   **Description:** Stelae (carved stone monuments) like Monument 3 and Stela 12, dated stylistically to circa 600-400 BCE.\n        *   **Analysis:** These monuments contain some of the earliest calendrical glyphs in Mesoamerica, typically recording a day name and number from the 260-day sacred calendar (*tzolk'in*).\n        *   **Careful Point:** These dates are cyclical. A date like \"1 Earthquake\" recurs every 260 days. The inscriptions do not include a year or a position in a larger calendar cycle (like the Long Count), so they do not fix a unique, absolute date in time.\n\n    *   **Stela C from Tres Zapotes:**\n        *   **Description:** A monument fragment discovered in Tres Zapotes, an Epi-Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico.\n        *   **Analysis:** This stela contains a date written in the Mesoamerican **Long Count** calendar system. The Long Count system records the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date, allowing for the recording of specific, non-repeating dates over thousands of years.\n        *   **The Date:** The date inscribed is **7.16.6.16.18**. Using the standard GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation, this Long Count date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This is the earliest *absolute* date recorded in a fixed, linear calendar. It is not just a day in a repeating cycle but a specific point in history.\n\n    *   **Other Early Long Count Dates:**\n        *   **Tuxtla Statuette:** An Epi-Olmec artifact with a Long Count date of 8.6.2.4.17, which corresponds to 162 CE. This is significantly later than the date on Stela C.\n        *   **Tikal Stela 2:** One of the earliest known Maya Long Count dates is 8.12.14.8.15, corresponding to 292 CE, which is also much later.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile other artifacts contain older writing (Cascajal Block) or older, but cyclical, calendrical notations (Zapotec stelae), the monument known as **Stela C from Tres Zapotes** holds the record for the earliest known *absolute date* recorded in an aboriginal American writing system. The date, written in the Epi-Olmec script using the Long Count calendar, pinpoints a specific day in history.\n\nThe final answer is the date itself.\n\n<<<September 3, 32 BCE>>>"
