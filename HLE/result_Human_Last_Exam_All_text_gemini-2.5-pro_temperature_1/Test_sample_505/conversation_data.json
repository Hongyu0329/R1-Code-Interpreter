    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Surface Code\nThe surface code is a type of topological quantum error-correcting code. It encodes logical information (logical qubits) onto a 2D grid of physical qubits. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is laid out. The key topological features are its genus ($g$, the number of \"handles\" or \"donuts\") and the number of boundaries ($b$, which includes outer edges and inner \"holes\").\n\n### Step 2: The Formula for Logical Qubits\nThe number of logical qubits, denoted by $k$, that can be encoded on a surface is determined by its topology using the following general formula:\n$k = 2g + b - 1$\n*   $g$ is the genus of the surface.\n*   $b$ is the number of boundaries (or holes/perimeters).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze a Single \"Patch of Surface Code\"\nThe question specifies \"a patch of surface code\". In the context of quantum computing, a \"patch\" typically refers to a finite, simply connected piece of a 2D plane.\n*   **Genus ($g$):** A planar patch has no handles, so its genus is $g=0$.\n*   **Boundaries ($b$):** The patch has \"two holes\". These holes create two separate inner boundaries. Additionally, the patch itself has an outer perimeter, which also functions as a boundary. Therefore, the total number of boundaries for a single patch is:\n    $b = (\\text{number of inner holes}) + (\\text{outer boundary}) = 2 + 1 = 3$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Logical Qubits for One Patch\nNow we can use the formula from Step 2 to find the number of logical qubits ($k_{patch}$) in one such patch. We substitute $g=0$ and $b=3$:\n$k_{patch} = 2g + b - 1$\n$k_{patch} = 2(0) + 3 - 1$\n$k_{patch} = 0 + 2$\n$k_{patch} = 2$\n\nSo, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode a maximum of 2 logical qubits.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A common shortcut for planar codes ($g=0$) is that the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of holes, $k=N_{holes}$. This is derived from the main formula: $k = (N_{holes} + 1) - 1 = N_{holes}$. Using this shortcut, with 2 holes, we also get $k=2$. This confirms our calculation.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Full System of \"Two Patches\"\nThe question asks for the total number of logical qubits in \"two patches of surface code\". This phrasing implies two separate, physically distinct, and non-interacting surface code systems.\n*   Logical qubits in Patch 1: $k_1 = 2$\n*   Logical qubits in Patch 2: $k_2 = 2$ (since it's an identical patch)\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits\nSince the two patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n$k_{total} = k_1 + k_2$\n$k_{total} = 2 + 2 = 4$\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is the sum of the qubits from each of the two independent patches. Each patch with two holes can encode 2 logical qubits, so two such patches can encode a total of 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
