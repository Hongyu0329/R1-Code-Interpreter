    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem**\n\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\nWe are also given that their derivatives are always positive:\n*   $f'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n*   $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n\nA fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. We want to find the maximum number of fixed points for the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. This means we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation:\n$f(g(x)) = x$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Properties of f(x) and g(x)**\n\nLet $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ with $a \\neq 0$.\nThen $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$.\nThe condition $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ means that this quadratic is always positive. For a quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive and its discriminant must be negative.\n1.  Leading coefficient: $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$.\n2.  Discriminant: $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 - 3ac < 0$.\nSince $f'(x) > 0$, the function $f(x)$ is strictly increasing for all $x$.\n\nSimilarly, for $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$ with $p \\neq 0$.\n$g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$.\nThe condition $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ implies:\n1.  Leading coefficient: $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$.\n2.  Discriminant: $(2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) < 0 \\implies 4q^2 - 12pr < 0 \\implies q^2 - 3pr < 0$.\nSince $g'(x) > 0$, the function $g(x)$ is also strictly increasing for all $x$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Degree of the Fixed-Point Equation**\n\nWe are looking for the number of solutions to $f(g(x)) = x$.\nLet's define a new polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The solutions to $f(g(x)) = x$ are the roots of $P(x) = 0$.\n\n*   The degree of $f(x)$ is 3.\n*   The degree of $g(x)$ is 3.\n*   The degree of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is the product of their degrees: $\\deg(h) = \\deg(f) \\times \\deg(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe leading term of $g(x)$ is $px^3$. The leading term of $f(y)$ is $ay^3$. So the leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3 x^9$. Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $ap^3$ is positive and non-zero.\n\nThe polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is therefore a polynomial of degree 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots.\nThus, the equation $f(g(x)) = x$ can have at most 9 solutions. The maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**Step 4: Show that 9 Fixed Points is Achievable**\n\nNow we must determine if it's possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and result in 9 distinct real roots for $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\nAccording to Rolle's Theorem, if a differentiable function $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\nFor $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $P(x)$:\n$P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n\nSo, we need to show that the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1 = 0$ can have 8 distinct real roots. This is equivalent to showing that the function $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ can intersect the line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points.\n\nLet's analyze the function $H(x)$:\n*   $f'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $f'(g(x))$ is a composite polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $g'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nAn eighth-degree polynomial can intersect a horizontal line at most 8 times. To show that 8 intersections are possible, we need to show that $H(x)$ can have enough local extrema (wiggles).\nFor $H(x)$ to intersect a line 8 times, it must have at least 7 local extrema (4 local minima and 3 local maxima, or vice versa). For this to occur, its derivative $H'(x)$ must have 7 distinct real roots.\n\nLet's examine $H'(x)$:\n$H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[f'(g(x))g'(x)]$\nUsing the product rule:\n$H'(x) = [f''(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)] \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$\n$H'(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$\n\nLet's check the degree of $H'(x)$:\n*   $\\deg(f(x))=3 \\implies \\deg(f'(x))=2 \\implies \\deg(f''(x))=1$.\n*   $\\deg(g(x))=3 \\implies \\deg(g'(x))=2 \\implies \\deg(g''(x))=1$.\n*   $\\deg(f''(g(x))) = 1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n*   $\\deg((g'(x))^2) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   $\\deg(f'(g(x))) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $\\deg(g''(x)) = 1$.\nThe degree of the first term $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$ is $3+4=7$.\nThe degree of the second term $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $6+1=7$.\nThe leading coefficients do not cancel (a detailed check shows the leading coefficient of $H'(x)$ is $72ap^3$), so $H'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\nA polynomial of degree 7 can have up to 7 distinct real roots. The constraints on the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ (e.g., $b^2-3ac < 0$) are open inequalities, leaving enough freedom to choose coefficients such that $H'(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots. This ensures $H(x)$ can have 7 local extrema (4 minima and 3 maxima, since its leading coefficient is positive).\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that the minima of $H(x)$ are below 1 and the maxima are above 1. We can adjust the functions. For instance, consider a new function $f_k(x) = k \\cdot f(x)$ for some positive constant $k$. $f_k'(x)=k f'(x) > 0$, so the condition holds. The corresponding $H_k(x)$ becomes $k \\cdot H(x)$. By choosing $k$ appropriately, we can scale the entire graph of $H(x)$ up or down to ensure it crosses the line $y=1$ eight times.\n\nSince it is possible for $P'(x)=0$ to have 8 distinct real roots, it is possible for $P(x)=0$ to have 9 distinct real roots.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n1.  The problem of finding the number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is equivalent to finding the number of roots of the polynomial $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n2.  This polynomial has a degree of 9, so it can have a maximum of 9 real roots.\n3.  A constructive argument based on Rolle's theorem and analysis of the derivatives shows that it is possible to define polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
