The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial; it follows the Parker Spiral, which typically makes an angle of about 45 degrees with the radial direction. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is a common practical approximation. This is justified by Taylor's "frozen-in" hypothesis, where the fast, radially flowing solar wind causes the spacecraft to measure a one-dimensional spatial cut of the plasma structures along the radial direction. Therefore, fluctuations perpendicular to this radial sampling direction are analyzed. While not as physically precise as using a field-aligned coordinate system (which is the ideal method), this approximation is computationally simple and often sufficient for identifying the wave polarization (left vs. right), especially in large statistical studies.
