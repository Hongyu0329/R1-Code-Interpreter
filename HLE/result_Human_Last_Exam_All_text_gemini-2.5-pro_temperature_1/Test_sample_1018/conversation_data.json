    "This problem asks for the computation of the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. We will solve this by first finding the simplicial volume of each surface and then using the product formula for simplicial volumes.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Simplicial Volume of a Closed Oriented Surface**\n\nLet $\\Sigma_g$ be a closed oriented surface of genus $g$. Its simplicial volume, denoted $||\\Sigma_g||$, is a topological invariant. The value of $||\\Sigma_g||$ depends on the genus $g$:\n*   If $g=0$ (the sphere $S^2$) or $g=1$ (the torus $T^2$), the fundamental group $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_g)$ is amenable. A key theorem in the theory of simplicial volume states that if the fundamental group of a manifold is amenable, its simplicial volume is zero. Thus, $||\\Sigma_0|| = 0$ and $||\\Sigma_1|| = 0$.\n*   If $g \\ge 2$, the surface $\\Sigma_g$ admits a complete hyperbolic metric. In this case, its simplicial volume is non-zero and is related to its Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$. The formula is:\n    $||\\Sigma_g|| = -2\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = -2(2 - 2g) = 4g - 4$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** It is crucial to check the genus of the surfaces to determine which formula to apply. A common mistake would be to apply the formula $4g-4$ without checking if $g \\ge 2$. If one of the surfaces had genus 0 or 1, its simplicial volume would be 0, and the final answer would also be 0.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Simplicial Volumes of $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$**\n\nWe apply the formula from Step 1 to our specific surfaces.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g = 31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, the surface is hyperbolic and its simplicial volume is non-zero.\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g = 17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, this surface is also hyperbolic.\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n**Step 3: The Product Formula for Simplicial Volume**\n\nA fundamental result by M. Gromov states that the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented manifolds is related to the simplicial volumes of the factors. If $M_1$ and $M_2$ are closed oriented manifolds of dimensions $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively, then the simplicial volume of their product $M_1 \\times M_2$ is given by:\n$||M_1 \\times M_2|| = \\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1} ||M_1|| \\cdot ||M_2||$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The formula includes a binomial coefficient which depends on the dimensions of the factor manifolds. It is not simply the product of the individual simplicial volumes.\n\nIn our problem, $M_1 = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $M_2 = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   The dimension of $M_1 = \\Sigma_{31}$ is $n_1 = 2$.\n*   The dimension of $M_2 = \\Sigma_{17}$ is $n_2 = 2$.\n\nThe binomial coefficient is:\n$\\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1} = \\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nNow we can combine the results from the previous steps to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\binom{4}{2} \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}||$.\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n$6 \\times 120 = 720$.\n$720 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The final step involves arithmetic. It's good practice to double-check the calculation.\n$720 \\times 64 = 720 \\times (60 + 4) = 720 \\times 60 + 720 \\times 4 = 43200 + 2880 = 46080$.\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 46080.\n\n<<<46080>>>"
