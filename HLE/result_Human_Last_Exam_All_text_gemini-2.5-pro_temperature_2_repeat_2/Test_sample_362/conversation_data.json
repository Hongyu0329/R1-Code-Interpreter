    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is pivalaldehyde. Its IUPAC name is 2,2-dimethylpropanal. The structure consists of a tert-butyl group, (CH3)3C-, attached to an aldehyde functional group, -CHO.\n        *   Structure: (CH3)3C-CHO\n    *   **Wittig Reagent (Phosphorus Ylide):** The second reactant is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane.\n        *   \"triphenyl-l5-phosphane\" indicates a triphenylphosphine group, Ph3P.\n        *   \"ethylidene\" describes the carbanion portion attached to the phosphorus. It's a two-carbon fragment derived from ethane, `(-CH-CH2-)`, where the bond to phosphorus is on the first carbon.\n        *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" indicates that a 2-chlorophenyl group (a benzene ring with a chlorine atom at the ortho position) is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene group.\n        *   Putting this together, the structure of the ylide is Ph3P=CH-CH2-(C6H4)-Cl, where the chlorine is at the 2-position of the phenyl ring.\n\n2.  **Understand the Wittig Reaction:**\n    *   The Wittig reaction is a chemical reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a triphenyl phosphonium ylide (a Wittig reagent) to give an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n    *   The core transformation involves the replacement of the oxygen atom from the carbonyl group (C=O) with the carbon fragment from the ylide (C=CR'R'').\n    *   Essentially, C=O + Ph3P=C(R1)(R2) â†’ C=C(R1)(R2) + Ph3P=O.\n\n3.  **Apply the Reaction to the Specific Reactants:**\n    *   The carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde, (CH3)3C-**C**HO, will form a new double bond with the alpha-carbon of the ylide, Ph3P=**C**H-CH2-(C6H4)-Cl.\n    *   The fragments that will combine are: [(CH3)3C-CH=] and [=CH-CH2-(C6H4)-Cl].\n    *   The resulting alkene structure will be: (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(C6H4)-Cl.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism):**\n    *   The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the nature of the ylide.\n    *   The ylide in this reaction is Ph3P=CH-R, where R = -CH2-(2-chlorophenyl). The group 'R' is an alkyl-type group. There are no electron-withdrawing groups (like -C=O, -CN, etc.) directly attached to the alpha-carbon to stabilize the carbanion character via resonance.\n    *   Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized (or unstabilized) ylide**.\n    *   The general rule for Wittig reactions with non-stabilized ylides is that they preferentially form the **(Z)-alkene** (or cis-alkene) as the major product under kinetic control (standard conditions). This is because the initial cycloaddition and subsequent collapse of the oxaphosphetane intermediate are faster for the pathway leading to the Z-isomer.\n    *   Let's analyze the groups on the newly formed double bond to assign Z configuration:\n        *   On one carbon: A tert-butyl group [-C(CH3)3] and a hydrogen atom [-H]. The tert-butyl group has higher priority (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules).\n        *   On the other carbon: A 2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl group [-CH2-C6H4-Cl] and a hydrogen atom [-H]. The ethyl-phenyl group has higher priority.\n    *   In the (Z)-isomer, the two higher-priority groups (tert-butyl and 2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl) are on the **same side** of the double bond.\n\n5.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   The final structure is (Z)-(CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(C6H4)-Cl.\n    *   To name it according to IUPAC nomenclature, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    *   Chain: -CH2-CH=CH-C(CH3)3. This is a derivative of pentene.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the end closest to the phenyl group to give the double bond the lowest possible number: 1-[CH2]-2-[CH=]3-[=CH]-4-[C(CH3)3]. The chain is `pent-2-ene`.\n    *   Identify the substituents:\n        *   At position 1: a `(2-chlorophenyl)` group.\n        *   At position 4: two `methyl` groups (`4,4-dimethyl`).\n    *   Putting it all together with the stereochemistry gives the name: **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction is a Wittig olefination between pivalaldehyde and an unstabilized phosphorus ylide. This reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with the ylide's carbon fragment to form a new C=C double bond. Due to the use of an unstabilized ylide, the reaction's major product is the (Z)-isomer.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
