    "This question asks to identify the crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique directional axis, meaning opposite ends of any axis are equivalent by symmetry.\n3.  **Allows for optical activity:** The crystal has the appropriate symmetry to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\nLet's analyze each condition based on the symmetry elements of a crystal's point group.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the symmetry requirement for Optical Activity**\nOptical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarization of light. This phenomenon is described by the gyration tensor. According to Neumann's Principle, the physical properties of a crystal must be invariant under the symmetry operations of the crystal's point group. For optical activity, the gyration tensor is only non-zero if the crystal class lacks a center of symmetry (also called an inversion center, denoted as $\\bar{1}$).\n*   **Conclusion:** Crystal classes that allow for optical activity must be **non-centrosymmetric**.\n*   There are 32 crystal classes in total. 11 are centrosymmetric, and 21 are non-centrosymmetric. So, we start our search with the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes.\n\n**The 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes are:**\n1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, $\\bar{4}$, 422, 4mm, $\\bar{4}$2m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, $\\bar{6}$, 622, 6mm, $\\bar{6}$m2, 23, 432, $\\bar{4}$3m.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the symmetry requirement for being Achiral**\nA crystal is achiral if it possesses any improper rotation axis ($\\bar{n}$). Improper rotation axes include the inversion center ($\\bar{1}$) and mirror planes (m, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$).\n*   From Step 1, we have already excluded all centrosymmetric classes, so the crystal classes we are looking for cannot have an inversion center ($\\bar{1}$).\n*   Therefore, for a class to be both non-centrosymmetric (allows optical activity) and achiral, it must possess an improper rotation axis other than $\\bar{1}$. This means it must have a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis like $\\bar{4}$ or $\\bar{6}$.\n*   We now filter our list of 21 non-centrosymmetric classes to find the ones that are achiral. The chiral classes (lacking any improper rotation axis) are: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432. We remove these from our list.\n\n**The remaining achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes are:**\nm, mm2, $\\bar{4}$, 4mm, $\\bar{4}$2m, 3m, $\\bar{6}$, 6mm, $\\bar{6}$m2, $\\bar{4}$3m.\nThis list contains 10 classes that satisfy the first and third conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the symmetry requirement for being Non-polar**\nA crystal class is polar if it has a unique direction, or polar axis. There are 10 polar crystal classes, which are defined by having a single unique rotation axis or being a subclass of such a group without symmetry elements that would make the ends of the axis equivalent.\n**The 10 polar classes are:** 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n*   A crystal class is non-polar if it is not on this list.\n*   We now take our list of 10 classes from Step 2 and remove any that are polar.\n\n**Filtering the list from Step 2:**\n*   m (is polar) -> Remove\n*   mm2 (is polar) -> Remove\n*   $\\bar{4}$ (is not polar) -> **Keep**\n*   4mm (is polar) -> Remove\n*   $\\bar{4}$2m (is not polar) -> **Keep**\n*   3m (is polar) -> Remove\n*   $\\bar{6}$ (is not polar) -> **Keep**\n*   6mm (is polar) -> Remove\n*   $\\bar{6}$m2 (is not polar) -> **Keep**\n*   $\\bar{4}$3m (is not polar) -> **Keep**\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\nAfter applying all three conditions, we are left with five crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\nThe final list of crystal classes is:\n1.  **$\\bar{4}$** (Tetragonal system)\n2.  **$\\bar{4}$2m** (Tetragonal system)\n3.  **$\\bar{6}$** (Hexagonal system)\n4.  **$\\bar{6}$m2** (Hexagonal system)\n5.  **$\\bar{4}$3m** (Cubic system)\n\n<<<The achiral, non-polar crystal classes with the correct symmetry for optical activity are $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2, and $\\bar{4}$3m.>>>"
