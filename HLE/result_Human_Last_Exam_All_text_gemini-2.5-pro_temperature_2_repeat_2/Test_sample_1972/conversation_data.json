    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into two main clues.**\n\nThe question provides two distinct descriptions attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  **A description of the novel:** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  **A description of the author:** He is \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nThe question presumes that both of these descriptions refer to the same novel and its author.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue: The author description.**\n\n*   The phrase \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a very specific piece of literary criticism.\n*   Borges made this exact comment in his prologue for the novel **_Pedro Páramo_** by the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**. This prologue was written for Borges's \"A Personal Library\" series.\n*   Borges deeply admired William Faulkner's work but found it notoriously complex. He saw Rulfo as an author who managed to capture a similar mythic, regional atmosphere and utilize complex narrative structures (like non-linear timelines and shifting perspectives) but did so with a sparse, condensed, and powerful prose that was simpler and more direct than Faulkner's.\n*   This clue points unequivocally to Juan Rulfo and his single novel, _Pedro Páramo_.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the first clue: The novel's description.**\n\n*   The quote \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" is indeed a quote from Jorge Luis Borges.\n*   **Careful Point:** While this quote would aptly describe the visceral power and intricate structure of _Pedro Páramo_, historical records show that Borges originally used this specific phrase in a 1949 review of a different novel: **_Adán Buenosayres_** by the Argentine writer Leopoldo Marechal.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues and resolve the discrepancy.**\n\n*   We have a situation where the question combines two separate Borges comments about two different books and asks for a single answer.\n*   Clue 2 (\"a continuator... of Faulkner\") is a precise, analytical statement that Borges made directly in his prologue about _Pedro Páramo_. This connection is famous and well-documented.\n*   Clue 1 (the \"tiger\" and \"chess\" quote) is a poetic flourish that, while genuinely from Borges, points to a different book.\n*   Given that the second clue is so specific and defines Borges's high esteem for a particular author's unique relationship to a literary giant like Faulkner, it is the far stronger and more defining clue. The conflation of the first quote is a common error, likely because it so aptly captures the feeling of reading _Pedro Páramo_.\n*   Therefore, the intended answer, based on the most specific and significant evidence, is the novel that Borges famously praised by calling its author a successor to Faulkner.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe author Borges described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is Juan Rulfo. The novel for which Rulfo is famous and which was the subject of Borges's praise is _Pedro Páramo_.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
