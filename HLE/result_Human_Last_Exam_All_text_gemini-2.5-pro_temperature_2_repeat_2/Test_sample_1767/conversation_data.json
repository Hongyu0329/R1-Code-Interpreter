    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Chern Number**\nThe Chern number (C) is a topological invariant of a 2D material. It is an integer that characterizes the topology of the electronic band structure. Physically, it determines the quantized Hall conductance (`σ_xy`) of the system according to the formula:\n`σ_xy = C * (e^2 / h)`\nwhere `e` is the elementary charge and `h` is Planck's constant.\n\nA non-zero Chern number implies the system is a \"Chern insulator,\" which is insulating in the bulk but must host conducting states on its edges or boundaries.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**\nA key principle in topological physics is the bulk-boundary correspondence. It states that the number of protected, gapless, chiral (moving in one direction) edge states at a boundary is equal to the change in the Chern number across that boundary.\n\n*   For a single Chern insulator with C=1 bordering a vacuum (C=0), the change in Chern number is `ΔC = 1 - 0 = 1`. This means there is exactly one chiral edge state on this boundary.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the System Configuration**\nThe problem describes two Chern insulators, let's call them CI1 and CI2.\n*   Chern number of CI1: `C1 = 1`\n*   Chern number of CI2: `C2 = 1`\n\nThey are connected laterally, meaning they are placed side-by-side. The phrase \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is crucial: it means that from an electronic perspective, they are not two separate systems but have merged into a single, larger system.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Additivity of the Chern Number**\nThe Chern number is an additive topological invariant. When two gapped systems are combined into a single larger system without closing the bulk energy gap, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components.\n\n*   `C_total = C1 + C2`\n*   `C_total = 1 + 1`\n*   `C_total = 2`\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction (the combined system) is 2.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **Nature of the Junction:** The term \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is the most important condition. It ensures that the two insulators form a single, coherent quantum system. If they were separated by a significant barrier (like a trivial insulator or vacuum), they would remain two independent systems.\n\n2.  **Additivity Principle:** The core concept is that the Chern number is additive. This is analogous to how adding two parallel wires adds their conductances. Since the Hall conductance is directly proportional to the Chern number, combining two systems that each have a Hall conductance of `e^2/h` results in a total Hall conductance of `2e^2/h`, which corresponds to a Chern number of 2.\n\n3.  **Verification with Edge States:** We can verify this result using the bulk-boundary correspondence.\n    *   Consider the setup: `[Vacuum (C=0)] | [CI1 (C=1)] | [CI2 (C=1)] | [Vacuum (C=0)]`.\n    *   **Outer Boundary (CI2 and Vacuum):** The change in Chern number at the rightmost boundary is `ΔC = C_vacuum - C_CI2 = 0 - 1 = -1`. This implies one edge state.\n    *   **Internal Interface (CI1 and CI2):** The change in Chern number at the interface between the two insulators is `ΔC = C_CI2 - C_CI1 = 1 - 1 = 0`. A change of zero means there are no net protected chiral edge states at this internal boundary. The original edge states of the individual insulators that would have existed here are removed (or \"gapped out\") upon forming the junction.\n    *   **Outer Boundary (Vacuum and CI1):** The change in Chern number at the leftmost boundary is `ΔC = C_CI1 - C_vacuum = 1 - 0 = 1`. This implies another edge state.\n    *   **Combined System View:** If we view the `[CI1 | CI2]` block as a single system with `C_total = 2`, the boundaries are with the vacuum.\n        *   Left boundary: `ΔC = C_total - C_vacuum = 2 - 0 = 2`. This predicts two chiral edge states.\n        *   Right boundary: `ΔC = C_vacuum - C_total = 0 - 2 = -2`. This predicts two chiral edge states with the opposite chirality.\n    *   This confirms that a system formed by merging two C=1 insulators behaves as a single C=2 insulator.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify Given Properties:** We have two systems, System 1 and System 2. `C_System1 = 1` and `C_System2 = 1`.\n2.  **Identify Operation:** The systems are connected to form a single larger system with negligible internal barriers.\n3.  **Apply Rule:** The Chern number is an additive property for combined systems.\n4.  **Calculate Total Chern Number:** `C_total = C_System1 + C_System2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nThe Chern number of the resulting junction is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
