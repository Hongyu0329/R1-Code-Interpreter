    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Equilibrium Points:**\n    The given differential equation is $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$.\n    Equilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\n    So, we need to solve the algebraic equation:\n    $$\n    -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n    $$\n    To solve for $x$, we can factor the polynomial. First, factor out a common term of $-x$:\n    $$\n    -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n    $$\n    The quadratic expression inside the parentheses is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2$.\n    So the equation becomes:\n    $$\n    -x(x - 1)^2 = 0\n    $$\n    The solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points of the system.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stability of Each Equilibrium Point:**\n    To determine the stability, we analyze the sign of the function $f(x) = -x(x - 1)^2$ in the intervals around the equilibrium points. The sign of $f(x)$ tells us whether the solution $x(t)$ is increasing ($f(x)>0$) or decreasing ($f(x)<0$).\n    We can construct a phase line by testing points in the intervals $(-\\infty, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(1, \\infty)$.\n\n    *   **Interval $(-\\infty, 0)$:** Let's pick a test value, say $x = -1$.\n        $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1 - 1)^2 = 1 \\cdot (-2)^2 = 4$.\n        Since $f(x) > 0$, $x(t)$ is increasing in this interval. This means solutions to the left of 0 move towards 0.\n\n    *   **Interval $(0, 1)$:** Let's pick a test value, say $x = 0.5$.\n        $f(0.5) = -(0.5)(0.5 - 1)^2 = -0.5 \\cdot (-0.5)^2 = -0.5 \\cdot 0.25 = -0.125$.\n        Since $f(x) < 0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing in this interval. This means solutions between 0 and 1 move towards 0.\n\n    *   **Interval $(1, \\infty)$:** Let's pick a test value, say $x = 2$.\n        $f(2) = -(2)(2 - 1)^2 = -2 \\cdot 1^2 = -2$.\n        Since $f(x) < 0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing in this interval. This means solutions to the right of 1 move towards 1.\n\n3.  **Classify the Equilibrium Points:**\n    *   **At $x = 0$:** Solutions immediately to the left of 0 are increasing (moving towards 0), and solutions immediately to the right of 0 are decreasing (moving towards 0). Since trajectories from both sides converge to $x=0$, it is a **stable** equilibrium point (specifically, asymptotically stable).\n\n    *   **At $x = 1$:** Solutions immediately to the left of 1 are decreasing (moving away from 1), and solutions immediately to the right of 1 are decreasing (moving towards 1). Because solutions approach from one side but move away from the other, $x=1$ is a **semi-stable** equilibrium point.\n\n4.  **Count the Number of Stable Equilibria, $m$:**\n    The problem asks for $m$, the number of *stable* equilibrium points. In the standard classification of one-dimensional systems, a semi-stable point is considered unstable because not all nearby trajectories converge to it. For a point to be stable (in the sense of Lyapunov), all nearby trajectories must remain close for all future time, which is not true for a semi-stable point.\n    Therefore, the only stable equilibrium point is $x=0$.\n    This gives us $m=1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    The question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\n    Substituting $m=1$ into the expression, we get:\n    $$\n    1 - 2^{4048}\n    $$\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Finding all roots:** It is important to factor the polynomial completely to find all equilibrium points. The factorization $-x(x-1)^2=0$ clearly shows the roots at $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n*   **Definition of Stability:** The main careful point is the correct interpretation of \"stable.\" A semi-stable point is not considered stable in the rigorous definition because nearby solutions can move far away. Thus, it should not be included in the count of stable equilibria.\n*   **Stability Test Method:** While the derivative test ($f'(x^*)$) is often used, it is inconclusive if $f'(x^*)=0$. For this problem, $f'(x) = -3x^2+4x-1$. We find $f'(0)=-1<0$ (stable) but $f'(1)=0$ (inconclusive). The phase line analysis of the sign of $f(x)$ is a more robust method that correctly classifies all points, including the semi-stable one.\n\nWith $m=1$, the final value is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
