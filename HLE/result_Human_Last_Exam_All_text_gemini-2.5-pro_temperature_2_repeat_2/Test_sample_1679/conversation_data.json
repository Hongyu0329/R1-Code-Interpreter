    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\"**\nThe question refers to the Luxor Obelisks. It is important to know their locations to identify them in films.\n*   One obelisk stands at the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   Its twin was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands at the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\nTherefore, the search is for the first Best Picture-winning film that features a scene in either Luxor, Egypt (showing the temple's obelisk) or Paris, France (showing the Place de la Concorde).\n\n**Step 2: Create a Chronological List of Best Picture Winners and Analyze Their Settings**\nWe must go through the winners in order, starting from the first award, to find the earliest film that meets the criteria.\n\n*   **1927/28 - 1936:** The winners from this period include *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Cavalcade*, and *Mutiny on the Bounty*. None of these are set in Paris or Luxor, Egypt. They are primarily set on WWI battlefields, in the US, Germany, or England.\n\n*   **1937 - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This film is a potential candidate as it is set in Paris. However, its story focuses on courtrooms, offices, and the degradation ceremony of Alfred Dreyfus, which historically occurred in the courtyard of the Ã‰cole Militaire, not the Place de la Concorde. A review of the film shows it does not feature prominent shots of the Place de la Concorde or its obelisk.\n\n*   **1938 - 1950:** Winners in this period include *Gone with the Wind* (American South), *Rebecca* (England), *Casablanca* (Morocco), and *All About Eve* (New York). None of these films are set in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **1951 - *An American in Paris***: This film is the next strong candidate. As the title suggests, the movie is set entirely in Paris and is celebrated for its musical numbers that incorporate the city's famous scenery. The film contains a romantic montage sequence where the protagonists, Jerry (Gene Kelly) and Lise (Leslie Caron), are seen by the fountains in the Place de la Concorde. In these shots, the Luxor Obelisk is clearly visible in the center of the square.\n\n**Step 3: Confirm the Finding**\nHaving identified *An American in Paris* (winner for the 1951 awards) as a film that depicts the obelisk, we can confirm it is the first. Our chronological review shows no earlier Best Picture winner features a confirmed scene at either the Place de la Concorde in Paris or the Luxor Temple in Egypt. While other later films, such as *Gigi* (1958) or *Chariots of Fire* (1981), also won Best Picture and featured Paris, they came after 1951.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen is *An American in Paris*, which shows the obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
