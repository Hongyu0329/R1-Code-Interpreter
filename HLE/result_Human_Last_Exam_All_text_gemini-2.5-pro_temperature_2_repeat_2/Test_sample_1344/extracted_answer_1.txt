Metal: Zirconium (Zr).
Ligand/Precursor System: A simple tetra-alkyl precursor, such as tetra(neopentyl)zirconium (`Zr(CH2CMe3)4`), where the primary, anchoring ligand becomes the siloxy group (`≡Si-O-`) from the support. The remaining alkyl groups are converted to hydrides under hydrogenolysis conditions.
Support: High-surface-area silica (SiO2) that has been thermally pre-treated (calcined at ~500°C) to control the surface hydroxyl group density, thereby ensuring the formation of isolated, well-defined single sites.
