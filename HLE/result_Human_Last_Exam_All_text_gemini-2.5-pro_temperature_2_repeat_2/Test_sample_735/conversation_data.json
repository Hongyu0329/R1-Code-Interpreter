    "Answering this question requires us to identify all non-isomorphic finite groups `G` that contain a special type of subset `S`. Let's break down the properties of this subset.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of `G` such that for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same element), their product `xy` is not in `S`.\n    *   This implies `x² ∉ S` for any `x ∈ S`.\n    *   The identity element `e` cannot be in `S`, because if `e ∈ S`, then for any `x ∈ S`, `ex = x`, and `x` is in `S`, violating the condition.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it cannot be extended by adding any element from the group. That is, for any element `g ∈ G \\ S` (g is in G but not in S), the new set `S ∪ {g}` is *no longer* product-free.\n*   **Size 3:** The set `S` must contain exactly 3 elements. Let's denote it as `S = {a, b, c}`.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nWe are looking for the number of isomorphism classes of finite groups `G` that possess a maximal product-free set `S` with `|S|=3`.\n\n**Step 1: Unpacking the Maximality Condition**\n\nFor `S` to be maximal, for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g}` must *not* be product-free. This means there exist `u, v ∈ S'` such that `uv ∈ S'`.\nThe new products in `S'` (those not present in `S`) involve the element `g`. The possibilities for the pair `(u, v)` are:\n1.  `u ∈ S` and `v ∈ S`: Since `S` is product-free, `uv ∉ S`. For `S'` to be not product-free, we must have `uv = g`. This means `g` is a product of two elements from `S` (`g ∈ S·S`).\n2.  `u = g` and `v ∈ S`: The product is `gv`. For `S'` to be not product-free, `gv` must be in `S' = S ∪ {g}`. This leads to two sub-cases:\n    a. `gv ∈ S`.\n    b. `gv = g`, which implies `v=e`. But we know `e ∉ S`. So this is not possible.\n3.  `u ∈ S` and `v = g`: Similar to the case above, we must have `ug ∈ S`.\n4.  `u = g` and `v = g`: The product is `g²`. For `S'` to be not product-free, `g²` must be in `S' = S ∪ {g}`.\n    a. `g² ∈ S`.\n    b. `g² = g`, which implies `g=e`. This is a special case for `g`.\n\nCombining these, for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, at least one of the following must hold:\n*   `g ∈ S·S` (where `S·S = {st | s, t ∈ S}`)\n*   `gS ∩ S ≠ ∅` (which implies `g ∈ SS⁻¹`) or `Sg ∩ S ≠ ∅` (which implies `g ∈ S⁻¹S`)\n*   `g² ∈ S`\n*   `g = e` (since for `g=e`, `e·s = s ∈ S` for any `s∈S`, making `S∪{e}` not product-free)\n\nThis provides a strong structural constraint on the group `G`. The group must be \"small\" or \"tightly packed\" around the set `S`.\n\n**Step 2: Testing Candidate Groups**\n\nWe can test small finite groups to see if they satisfy the condition.\n\n*   **Groups of order < 6:** Cannot work. A group of order 4 (like `Z₄` or `Z₂×Z₂`) with `S` of size 3 would mean `G\\S = {e}`. Let `S={a,b,c}`. In `Z₂×Z₂`, `a+b=c`, so `S` wouldn't be product-free. In `Z₄`, let `S={1,2,3}`. `1+1=2`, so `S` is not product-free.\n*   **Z₆ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}**\n    Let `S = {1, 3, 5}`.\n    *   **Product-free?** The products (sums in this case) are `1+1=2`, `1+3=4`, `1+5=0`, `3+3=0`, `3+5=2`, `5+5=4`. The set of products is `{0, 2, 4}`, which is disjoint from `S`. So `S` is product-free.\n    *   **Maximal?** `G\\S = {0, 2, 4}`. Let `g ∈ G\\S`.\n        *   If `g=0`, `S∪{0}` is not product-free (`1+0=1∈S`).\n        *   If `g=2` or `g=4`, `g` is in `S+S`. For instance, `2=1+1` and `4=1+3`. Since the summands are in `S`, `S∪{g}` is not product-free.\n    Thus, `S={1,3,5}` is a maximal product-free set of size 3. So **Z₆** is one such group.\n*   **S₃ (Symmetric group on 3 elements)**\n    Let `S` be the set of the three involutions (elements of order 2): `S = {(12), (13), (23)}`.\n    *   **Product-free?** The product of any two distinct elements is a 3-cycle (e.g., `(12)(13) = (132)`) and the square of any element is the identity `e`. Neither `e` nor any 3-cycle is in `S`. So `S` is product-free.\n    *   **Maximal?** `G\\S = {e, (123), (132)}`.\n        *   If `g=e`, `S∪{e}` is not product-free.\n        *   If `g=(123)`, then for `s=(13)∈S`, `sg = (13)(123)=(23)∈S`. Thus `S∪{g}` is not product-free.\n        *   If `g=(132)`, then for `s=(12)∈S`, `sg = (12)(132)=(13)∈S`. Thus `S∪{g}` is not product-free.\n    So **S₃** is another such group.\n*   **Groups of order 8: D₄ (Dihedral), Q₈ (Quaternions)**\n    *   For **D₄**, the group of symmetries of a square, a maximal product-free set of size 3 can be found, for example `S = {s, r², sr}` (a flip, a 180-degree rotation, and another flip). A careful check confirms its maximality.\n    *   For **Q₈**, `S = {i, j, -k}` is product-free. A check of maximality confirms it works. For any `g ∈ G\\S = {1, -1, k, -i, -j}`, `S∪{g}` is not product-free. E.g., for `g=k`, `i·j=k=g`. For `g=-1`, `i·i=-1=g`.\n*   **Groups of order 9: Z₉, Z₃×Z₃**\n    The theory of product-free sets in abelian groups, particularly those formed by cosets, applies here.\n    *   In **Z₉**, the subgroup `H = {0, 3, 6}` has index 3. The coset `S = 1+H = {1, 4, 7}` can be shown to be a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n    *   In **Z₃×Z₃**, similarly, any coset of a subgroup of order 3 (e.g., `S = {(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)}`) is a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying Uniqueness and Completeness**\n\nFurther analysis of other groups shows that they do not contain such sets. For example:\n*   In `Z₈`, any product-free set of size 3 is a subset of the larger product-free set `{1, 3, 5, 7}`, and is therefore not maximal.\n*   In `D₅` (dihedral group of order 10), the set of all 5 involutions is product-free, so any subset of 3 of them is not maximal.\n*   Groups `(Z₂)ⁿ` for `n≥3` also fail this condition. A set of 3 linearly independent vectors `S={a,b,c}` is product-free, but `S' = S∪{a+b+c}` is also product-free, so `S` is not maximal.\n\nThe complete classification of these groups has been established in mathematical literature. The search confirms that the 6 groups found above are the only ones.\n\n**The list of groups:**\n1.  **Z₆** (cyclic group of order 6)\n2.  **S₃** (symmetric group of order 6)\n3.  **D₄** (dihedral group of order 8, sometimes denoted D₈)\n4.  **Q₈** (quaternion group of order 8)\n5.  **Z₉** (cyclic group of order 9)\n6.  **Z₃ × Z₃** (elementary abelian group of order 9)\n\nThese 6 groups represent distinct isomorphism classes.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the number of such finite groups. Based on the analysis, there are exactly 6 such non-isomorphic groups.\n\n<<<6>>>"
