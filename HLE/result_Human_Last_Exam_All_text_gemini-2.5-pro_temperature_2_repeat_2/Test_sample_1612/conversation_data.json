    "To determine the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we must first understand what a Triple Crown is and then count the unique players who have achieved it.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Defining the Triple Crown**\n\nIn Major League Baseball, there are two distinct types of Triple Crowns: one for batting and one for pitching.\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their league (American or National) in three key offensive categories in a single season: **batting average (AVG)**, **home runs (HR)**, and **runs batted in (RBI)**.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their league in three key pitching categories in a single season: **wins (W)**, **earned run average (ERA)**, and **strikeouts (K)**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which means the number of unique individuals who have won. Some players have won a Triple Crown more than once, but we will count each of those players only one time for the final tally.\n\n**2. Counting the Batting Triple Crown Winners**\n\nThe Batting Triple Crown is a very rare achievement. We will list each unique player who has won it.\n\n*   **Players who won the Batting Triple Crown once:**\n    1.  Paul Hines (1878)\n    2.  Tip O'Neill (1887)\n    3.  Hugh Duffy (1894)\n    4.  Nap Lajoie (1901)\n    5.  Ty Cobb (1909)\n    6.  Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n    7.  Chuck Klein (1933)\n    8.  Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n    9.  Lou Gehrig (1934)\n    10. Joe Medwick (1937)\n    11. Mickey Mantle (1956)\n    12. Frank Robinson (1966)\n    13. Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n    14. Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n*   **Players who won the Batting Triple Crown more than once:**\n    15. Rogers Hornsby (won in 1922 and 1925)\n    16. Ted Williams (won in 1942 and 1947)\n\n**Total Number of Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners = 16**\n\n**3. Counting the Pitching Triple Crown Winners**\n\nThe Pitching Triple Crown has been achieved more frequently than its batting counterpart.\n\n*   **Players who won the Pitching Triple Crown once:**\n    1.  Tommy Bond (1877)\n    2.  Old Hoss Radbourn (1884)\n    3.  Guy Hecker (1884)\n    4.  Tim Keefe (1888)\n    5.  John Clarkson (1889)\n    6.  Amos Rusie (1894)\n    7.  Cy Young (1901)\n    8.  Rube Waddell (1905)\n    9.  Dazzy Vance (1924)\n    10. Bucky Walters (1939)\n    11. Lefty Gomez (1940)\n    12. Hal Newhouser (1945)\n    13. Steve Carlton (1972)\n    14. Dwight Gooden (1985)\n    15. Pedro Mart√≠nez (1999)\n    16. Randy Johnson (2002)\n    17. Johan Santana (2006)\n    18. Justin Verlander (2011)\n    19. Clayton Kershaw (2011)\n    20. Shane Bieber (2020)\n*   **Players who won the Pitching Triple Crown more than once:**\n    21. Christy Mathewson (won in 1905 and 1908)\n    22. Lefty Grove (won in 1930 and 1931)\n    23. Roger Clemens (won in 1997 and 1998)\n    24. Walter Johnson (won in 1913, 1918, and 1924)\n    25. Pete Alexander (won in 1915, 1916, and 1920)\n    26. Sandy Koufax (won in 1963, 1965, and 1966)\n\n**Total Number of Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners = 26**\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Winners**\n\nTo get the final answer, we add the number of unique batting winners to the number of unique pitching winners.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must ensure no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown. A review of the lists confirms there is no overlap.\n\n*   Total Winners = (Unique Batting Winners) + (Unique Pitching Winners)\n*   Total Winners = 16 + 26 = 42\n\n### Final Answer\nThere have been 42 unique players who have won either a batting or pitching Triple Crown in MLB history.\n\n<<<42>>>"
