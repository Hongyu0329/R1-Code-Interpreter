    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the solution and calculate the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The primary task is to compare two strings lexicographically. Lexicographical comparison means comparing strings character by character from left to right, like in a dictionary.\n2.  **Key Constraint:** The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means that an uppercase letter and its corresponding lowercase letter should be treated as identical (e.g., 'a' is equal to 'A').\n3.  **Input Specification:**\n    *   Two lines of input, each containing one string.\n    *   The strings are guaranteed to be of the same length.\n    *   The length of each string is between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive.\n    *   The strings contain only uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n4.  **Output Specification:**\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically less than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitivity:** This is the most critical point. A direct character-by-character comparison (e.g., `s1[i] == s2[i]`) will fail because ASCII values for uppercase letters are different from lowercase ones (e.g., 'A' is 65, 'a' is 97). The correct approach is to convert each pair of characters to a common case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase) before comparing them. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is perfect for this.\n2.  **Memory Allocation for Strings:** In C, to read a string of up to 100 characters, you need to allocate an array of `char` with a size of at least `101`. This is because C strings are null-terminated, meaning an extra byte is required to store the null character `\\0` that marks the end of the string.\n3.  **Memory Efficiency:** The problem specifically asks for the most memory-efficient program. This means we should:\n    *   Avoid creating extra copies of the strings. For example, do not create new lowercase versions of the entire strings in memory. Instead, convert and compare characters \"on-the-fly\" within a loop.\n    *   Use the smallest possible data types for variables. For instance, a loop counter that only needs to go up to 100 can be a `char` (1 byte) instead of an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n4.  **Equal Lengths:** The guarantee that strings are of the same length simplifies the logic. We don't have to handle cases where one string is a prefix of the other. The comparison loop can run until the end of either string.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer (Memory Calculation)\n\nTo write the most memory-efficient C program, we will follow the principles outlined above.\n\n1.  **Variable Declaration:** We need a minimal set of variables:\n    *   Two character arrays to store the input strings. Since the maximum length is 100, we need `char string1[101]` and `char string2[101]`.\n    *   A loop counter to iterate through the strings. The index will go from 0 to 99. A `char` type is sufficient for this range.\n\n2.  **Implementation Logic:**\n    *   Read both strings from the input using `scanf(\"%s%s\", string1, string2);`.\n    *   Use a `while` loop that continues as long as the character at the current index of the first string is not the null terminator (`while(string1[i])`).\n    *   Inside the loop, get the characters `string1[i]` and `string2[i]`.\n    *   Convert both to lowercase using `tolower()`.\n    *   Compare the lowercase characters. If they are different, print `-1` or `1` and exit the program immediately.\n    *   If the loop finishes, it means all characters were identical (case-insensitively), so print `0`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Memory Usage (`m`):**\n    We calculate the total memory by summing the sizes of all declared variables. We will assume standard sizes on a typical competitive programming platform (e.g., 64-bit Linux).\n\n    *   **First string buffer:** `char string1[101];`\n        *   Size = `101 characters * sizeof(char)`\n        *   Size = `101 * 1 byte` = **101 bytes**\n\n    *   **Second string buffer:** `char string2[101];`\n        *   Size = `101 characters * sizeof(char)`\n        *   Size = `101 * 1 byte` = **101 bytes**\n\n    *   **Loop counter:** `char i;`\n        *   Size = `sizeof(char)`\n        *   Size = **1 byte**\n\n    *   **Total Memory (`m`):**\n        *   m = (memory for string1) + (memory for string2) + (memory for loop counter)\n        *   m = 101 + 101 + 1\n        *   m = **203 bytes**\n\nTemporary variables used inside the loop (like `char c1 = tolower(...)`) are generally placed in registers or reused stack space and do not add to the total sum of allocated variable memory for this type of analysis. The calculated 203 bytes represent the minimum memory required for the program's variables to solve this problem correctly.\n\n<<<203>>>"
