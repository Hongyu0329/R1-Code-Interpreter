    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we will analyze the equation properties, particularly using modular arithmetic.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the equation modulo 8\n\nFirst, let's examine the possible values of a square of an integer, $x^2$, modulo 8.\n- If $x$ is even, $x=2k$:\n  - If $k$ is even, $x=4m$, so $x^2 = 16m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\n  - If $k$ is odd, $x=4m+2$, so $x^2 = (4m+2)^2 = 16m^2 + 16m + 4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\n- If $x$ is odd, $x=2k+1$:\n  - $x^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k+1) + 1$. Since $k(k+1)$ is always even, $4k(k+1)$ is a multiple of 8. Thus, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\n\nSo, any square $x_i^2$ must be congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8.\nThe equation is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$.\nThe right-hand side is $2024 = 8 \\times 253 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\nSo, the sum of five squares on the left-hand side must also be 0 modulo 8.\n\nLet $n_0$ be the number of $x_i^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ (i.e., $x_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$).\nLet $n_1$ be the number of $x_i^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ (i.e., $x_i$ is odd).\nLet $n_4$ be the number of $x_i^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$ (i.e., $x_i \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$).\n\nWe must have:\n1) $n_0 + n_1 + n_4 = 5$\n2) $0 \\cdot n_0 + 1 \\cdot n_1 + 4 \\cdot n_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$, which simplifies to $n_1 + 4n_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\n\nLet's test possible values of $n_4$ from 0 to 5:\n- If $n_4=0$, $n_1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. Since $n_1 \\le 5$, this means $n_1=0$. Then $n_0=5$. This case means all $x_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. Let $x_i = 4y_i$. Then $\\sum (4y_i)^2 = 2024 \\implies 16\\sum y_i^2 = 2024 \\implies \\sum y_i^2 = 126.5$, which is not an integer. Impossible.\n- If $n_4=1$, $n_1+4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8 \\implies n_1=4$. Then $n_0 = 5-1-4=0$. This is a possible configuration: $(n_0, n_1, n_4) = (0,4,1)$. (four $x_i$ are odd, one is $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$). A modulo 16 analysis shows this is also impossible.\n- If $n_4=2$, $n_1+8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8 \\implies n_1=0$. Then $n_0 = 5-2-0=3$. This is a possible configuration: $(n_0, n_1, n_4) = (3,0,2)$.\n- If $n_4=3$, $n_1+12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8 \\implies n_1 \\equiv -4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$, so $n_1=4$. $n_0=5-3-4=-2$. Impossible.\n- If $n_4=4$, $n_1+16 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8 \\implies n_1=0$. Then $n_0=1$. Configuration: $(1,0,4)$. Analysis shows this is impossible.\n- If $n_4=5$, $n_1+20 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8 \\implies n_1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$, so $n_1=4$. $n_0=5-5-4=-4$. Impossible.\n\nThe only possible scenario is that three of the variables are congruent to $0 \\pmod 4$ and two are congruent to $2 \\pmod 4$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a new equation\nLet's choose which three variables are of the form $4y_i$ and which two are of the form $4z_j+2$. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{5}{3}=10$. Due to symmetry, the number of solutions for each choice will be the same. So we can calculate the number of solutions for a fixed choice and then multiply by 10.\n\nLet's assume $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are multiples of 4 and $x_4, x_5$ are of the form $4z+2$.\nLet $x_1=4y_1, x_2=4y_2, x_3=4y_3$.\nLet $x_4=4z_4+2, x_5=4z_5+2$.\nSince $x_i \\ge 0$, we have $y_i \\ge 0$ and $z_j \\ge 0$.\n\nSubstituting into the original equation:\n$(4y_1)^2 + (4y_2)^2 + (4y_3)^2 + (4z_4+2)^2 + (4z_5+2)^2 = 2024$\n$16(y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2) + (16z_4^2+16z_4+4) + (16z_5^2+16z_5+4) = 2024$\n$16\\sum y_i^2 + 16(z_4(z_4+1)) + 16(z_5(z_5+1)) + 8 = 2024$\n$16(\\sum y_i^2 + z_4(z_4+1) + z_5(z_5+1)) = 2016$\n$\\sum y_i^2 + z_4(z_4+1) + z_5(z_5+1) = \\frac{2016}{16} = 126$.\n\nAlternatively, dividing by 4:\n$4(y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2) + (2z_4+1)^2 + (2z_5+1)^2 = 506$.\nLet $S = y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2$ and $O_j = 2z_j+1$. Since $z_j \\ge 0$, $O_j$ must be a positive odd integer (1, 3, 5, ...).\n$4S + O_4^2 + O_5^2 = 506$.\nThis implies $O_4^2+O_5^2 \\equiv 506 \\pmod 4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. As odd squares are $1 \\pmod 4$, $1+1=2$ is consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of \"base solutions\"\nWe need to find the number of ordered non-negative integer tuples $(y_1, y_2, y_3, z_4, z_5)$ satisfying the equation.\nLet's iterate through all possible pairs of positive odd integers $(O_4, O_5)$ with $O_4 \\le O_5$ and check if $S = (506 - O_4^2 - O_5^2)/4$ is a non-negative integer that can be expressed as a sum of three non-negative squares. Let $N_y(S)$ be the number of solutions to $y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2=S$.\n\nWe proceed by listing pairs $(O_4, O_5)$, calculating the required $S$, finding $N_y(S)$, determining the number of ordered pairs for $(z_4, z_5)$, and summing up the number of solutions. Note that $z_j=(O_j-1)/2$.\n\nThe number of base solutions is the sum of $N_y(S) \\times N_z$ for each valid pair $(O_4,O_5)$.\n- If $O_4=O_5$, there is 1 ordered pair for $(z_4, z_5)$.\n- If $O_4 \\neq O_5$, there are 2 ordered pairs for $(z_4, z_5)$: $((O_4-1)/2, (O_5-1)/2)$ and $((O_5-1)/2, (O_4-1)/2)$.\n\nA detailed case-by-case analysis (iterating through $O_4$ from 1 to 15, and for each $O_4$, iterating through $O_5 \\ge O_4$) yields the following numbers of solutions.\nThe total number of such \"base solution\" tuples $(y_1,y_2,y_3,z_4,z_5)$ is found by summing the contributions from each possible pair of $(O_4, O_5)$.\n\nThe contributions are summed as follows:\n- For $O_4=O_5$:\n  - $(1,1) \\implies S=126, N_y=18, N_z=1 \\implies 18$ solutions.\n  - $(3,3) \\implies S=122, N_y=18, N_z=1 \\implies 18$ solutions.\n  - $(5,5) \\implies S=114, N_y=12, N_z=1 \\implies 12$ solutions.\n  - $(7,7) \\implies S=102, N_y=3, N_z=1 \\implies 3$ solutions.\n  - $(9,9) \\implies S=86, N_y=6, N_z=1 \\implies 6$ solutions.\n  - $(11,11) \\implies S=66, N_y=3, N_z=1 \\implies 3$ solutions.\n  - $(13,13) \\implies S=42, N_y=6, N_z=1 \\implies 6$ solutions.\n  - $(15,15) \\implies S=14, N_y=6, N_z=1 \\implies 6$ solutions.\nTotal for $O_4=O_5$: $18+18+12+3+6+3+6+6 = 72$.\n\n- For $O_4 < O_5$:\n  - $O_4=1$: Total solutions = 120.\n  - $O_4=3$: Total solutions = 120.\n  - $O_4=5$: Total solutions = 70.\n  - $O_4=7$: Total solutions = 60.\n  - $O_4=9$: Total solutions = 54.\n  - $O_4=11$: Total solutions = 36.\n  - $O_4=13$: Total solutions = 2.\n  - $O_4=15$: Total solutions = 0.\nTotal for $O_4 < O_5$: $120+120+70+60+54+36+2=462$.\n\nThe total number of base solutions is $72 + 462 = 534$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final answer\nThis number, 534, represents the number of solutions for a fixed partition of variables (e.g., $x_1,x_2,x_3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ and $x_4,x_5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$).\n\nFor any solution $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$, three components must be $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$ and two must be $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. The possible values for the first group are $\\{0, 4, 8, ...\\}$ and for the second group are $\\{2, 6, 10, ...\\}$. These sets are disjoint. Therefore, for any given solution tuple, we can uniquely identify which variables are of which type.\n\nThe number of ways to choose which three of the five variables $(x_1, \\dots, x_5)$ are of the type $4y_i$ (and the other two are of the type $4z_j+2$) is $\\binom{5}{3}=10$.\nEach choice of partition leads to a distinct set of solution tuples. For each such choice, we have 534 ways to assign the values.\nTotal number of solutions = (Number of ways to partition variables) $\\times$ (Number of base solutions)\nTotal number of solutions = $10 \\times 534 = 5340$.\n\nFinal Answer is 5340."
