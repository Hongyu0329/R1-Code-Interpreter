No, this approach is not valid because it fundamentally fails to consider the perception of the relevant signal receiver: the predator. The validity of a mimicry syndrome is determined by whether predators perceive the species as similar, not humans. Human visual systems differ significantly from those of key bee predators like birds (e.g., humans cannot see UV light, which birds can), and standard photographs fail to capture the full spectral information and dynamic cues that constitute the bees' warning signal. Therefore, the resulting clusters would reflect human perceptual groupings, not the ecologically functional mimicry rings shaped by predator selection.
