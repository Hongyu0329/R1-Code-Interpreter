    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a historical sound change rule in English. It dictates that a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable of a word (the third syllable from the end). For this rule to apply, a word must have at least three syllables.\n\n*   **Key Conditions for TSL:**\n    1.  The word must have three or more syllables.\n    2.  The vowel in question must be in the antepenultimate (third-to-last) syllable.\n    3.  This vowel must be tense in the word's base form or a related word.\n\n*   **Classic Examples:**\n    *   `sane` /seɪn/ (tense /eɪ/) → `sanity` /ˈsænəti/ (lax /æ/). The vowel is in the first of three syllables.\n    *   `divine` /dɪˈvaɪn/ (tense /aɪ/) → `divinity` /dɪˈvɪnəti/ (lax /ɪ/). The vowel is in the second of four syllables (the antepenultimate one).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Word Based on the TSL Rule**\n\nWe will examine each word's syllable structure and its relationship to a base word with a tense vowel.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Pronunciation & Syllables:** /ˈsʌðərn/ (two syllables: south-ern).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word only has two syllables. The rule requires at least three syllables. Therefore, it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. The vowel change from `south` /saʊθ/ (tense) to `southern` /sʌðərn/ (lax) is due to a different historical shortening process.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Pronunciation & Syllables:** /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/ (four syllables: de-riv-a-tive).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has four syllables. The related base word is `derive` /dɪˈraɪv/, which has a tense vowel /aɪ/. In `derivative`, this vowel appears in the second syllable (-riv-), which is the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. The vowel has changed from tense /aɪ/ to lax /ɪ/. This is a clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Pronunciation & Syllables:** /səˈrɛnəti/ (four syllables: se-ren-i-ty).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has four syllables. The related base word is `serene` /səˈriːn/, with a tense vowel /iː/. In `serenity`, this vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable (-ren-). The vowel has changed from tense /iː/ to lax /ɛ/. This is another classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Pronunciation & Syllables:** /ˈplɛzənt/ (two syllables: pleas-ant).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has only two syllables. Like `southern`, it doesn't meet the structural requirement for TSL. The laxing of the vowel from the base `please` /pliːz/ (tense /iː/) is due to another rule (pre-cluster shortening).\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Pronunciation & Syllables:** /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/ (three syllables: grat-i-tude).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has three syllables. It is related to `grateful` /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/, where the corresponding vowel is the tense /eɪ/. In `gratitude`, this vowel is in the first syllable (grat-), which is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel has changed from tense /eɪ/ to lax /æ/. This is another example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Pronunciation & Syllables:** /ˈʃædoʊ/ (two syllables: shad-ow).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has only two syllables and cannot have undergone TSL. It is related to `shade` /ʃeɪd/ (tense /eɪ/).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Words That Did Not Undergo TSL**\n\nFrom our analysis, three words did not undergo trisyllabic laxing because they are disyllabic (have two syllables): `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. To find the single best answer, we need to consider a finer point of their history. The question asks which has \"not undergone\" the process. This implies looking at the word's vowel history more closely.\n\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` both exhibit a vowel that was laxed (shortened) from a tense (long) vowel in its base word (`south`, `please`), even if the process wasn't TSL.\n*   Let's examine the history of `shadow` and `shade`. Both derive from Old English words with short vowels: *sceadu* (`shadow`) and *scead* (`shade`). In Middle English, the vowel in *scead* was *lengthened* (tensed) because it was in an \"open syllable\" (*scha-de*), eventually becoming the modern /eɪ/ in `shade`. The vowel in *sceadwe* (`shadow`) remained short because it was in a \"closed syllable\" (*schad-we*), becoming the modern lax /æ/.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` all clearly show the effects of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` did not undergo TSL but did undergo other historical vowel laxing processes.\n*   `shadow` is unique in this list. It did not undergo TSL (it's disyllabic), and its lax vowel /æ/ is not the result of a laxing process. Instead, `shadow` preserves the original short vowel from Old English, while its counterpart `shade` is the word that underwent a sound change (vowel lengthening/tensing).\n\nTherefore, `shadow` is the word that has most definitively \"not undergone\" any historical process of vowel laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
