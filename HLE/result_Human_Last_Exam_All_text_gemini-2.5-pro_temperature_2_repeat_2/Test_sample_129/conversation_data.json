    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n### Step 1: Define Symbols, Rules, and Goal\n\n*   **Allowed Symbols:** `T` (True), `F` (False), `!` (NOT), `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `(`, `)`\n*   **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Operator Precedence:** `!` > `&` > `|`. Parentheses `()` override precedence.\n*   **Associativity:** `&` and `|` are typically left-associative (e.g., `a|b|c` is `(a|b)|c`).\n*   **Goal:** Find the count of all syntactically valid 5-symbol expressions that evaluate to `True`.\n\n### Step 2: Classify Expression Structures\n\nTo avoid double-counting, we can classify any valid boolean expression into one of four mutually exclusive types based on its top-level structure. An expression of length 5 must be one of the following:\n\n1.  **Type P (Parenthesized):** Of the form `(E)`, where `E` is a valid expression of length 3.\n2.  **Type N (Negation):** Of the form `!E`, where `E` is a valid expression of length 4. This form is only for expressions starting with `!` that are not Type P.\n3.  **Type D (Disjunction):** Of the form `E1 | E2`, where `|` is the operator with the lowest precedence. We split on the right-most, non-parenthesized `|`.\n4.  **Type C (Conjunction):** Of the form `E1 & E2`, where `&` is the operator with the lowest precedence. There are no top-level `|` operators. We split on the right-most, non-parenthesized `&`.\n\nWe will count the number of true expressions for each type.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Type P: `(E)`\n\nThe expression is `(E)` where `E` has length 3. For the whole expression to be true, `E` must evaluate to true. Let's find all valid, true expressions of length 3.\n\n*   **Form `A op B`** (A, B are T/F): `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. (4 expressions)\n*   **Form `!!A`** (A is T/F): `!!T`. (1 expression)\n*   **Form `(A)`** (A is T/F): `(T)`. (1 expression)\n\nTotal number of true, length-3 expressions is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nEach of these can be put inside parentheses to form a true 5-symbol expression.\n*Example: `(T&T)`, `(!!T)`, `((T))`*\n\n**Count for Type P = 6**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Type N: `!E`\n\nThe expression is `!E` where `E` has length 4. For `!E` to be true, `E` must be a valid, 4-symbol expression that evaluates to `False`. Let's find all such expressions `E`.\n\n*   **Sub-type P: `(e)` where `e` has length 2.** Valid `e`: `!T` (False), `!F` (True). The expression `(!T)` evaluates to False. (1 expression)\n*   **Sub-type N: `!e` where `e` has length 3.** For `!e` to be False, `e` must be True. We found 6 such true expressions of length 3 in Step 3. So, we have 6 False expressions here. *Example: `!(T&T)`, `!!!T`, `!(T)`*. (6 expressions)\n*   **Sub-type D: `e1 | e2` where `len(e1)+len(e2)=3`.** This can be `A|!B` or `!A|B`.\n    *   `A|!B`: `F|!T` evaluates to False. (1 expression)\n    *   `!A|B`: `!T|F` evaluates to False. (1 expression)\n*   **Sub-type C: `e1 & e2` where `len(e1)+len(e2)=3`.** This can be `A&!B` or `!A&B`.\n    *   `A&!B`: `T&!T`, `F&!T`, `F&!F` evaluate to False. (3 expressions)\n    *   `!A&B`: `!T&T`, `!T&F`, `!F&F` evaluate to False. (3 expressions)\n\nTotal number of False, length-4 expressions is 1 + 6 + (1+1) + (3+3) = 15.\nEach of these can be prefixed with `!` to make a true 5-symbol expression.\n\n**Count for Type N = 15**\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Analysis of Type D: `E1 | E2`\n\nThe main operator is `|`, and `len(E1) + 1 + len(E2) = 5`. For the expression to be true, we need (`E1` is true OR `E2` is true).\nWe split by `(len(E1), len(E2))`.\n\n*   **Split (1, 3): `A | E2`**. `E2` cannot have a top-level `|`.\n    *   If `A=T`: `E2` can be any valid length-3 expression with no top-level `|`. These are of the form `B&C`, `!!B`, `(B)`. There are `4+2+2 = 8` such expressions. All `T | E2` will be True. (8 expressions)\n    *   If `A=F`: `E2` must be True (and have no top-level `|`). The true ones are `T&T`, `!!T`, `(T)`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total for (1,3): 8 + 3 = 11.\n\n*   **Split (3, 1): `E1 | A`**.\n    *   **Form `B op C | A`**:\n        *   `B|C|A`: True unless all are F. (7 expressions)\n        *   `B&C|A`: `(B&C)|A`. True unless B&C is F and A is F. This happens for `F&T|F`, `T&F|F`, `F&F|F`. So 8-3=5 are True. (5 expressions)\n    *   **Form `!!B | A`**: Needs `!!B` or `A` to be True. `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T` are True. (3 expressions)\n    -   **Form `(B) | A`**: Needs `(B)` or `A` to be True. `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T` are True. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total for (3,1): 7 + 5 + 3 + 3 = 18.\n\n*   **Split (2, 2): `E1 | E2`**. `E1` and `E2` are `!A` form. `!A | !B`.\n    *   True unless both `!A` and `!B` are False. This only happens for `!T|!T`.\n    *   So, `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` are True. (3 expressions)\n\nTotal count for Type D = 11 + 18 + 3 = 32.\n\n**Count for Type D = 32**\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Analysis of Type C: `E1 & E2`\n\nThe main operator is `&`, and there are no top-level `|`s. `len(E1) + 1 + len(E2) = 5`. For the expression to be true, `E1` must be true AND `E2` must be true.\n\n*   **Split (1, 3): `A & E2`**. `A` must be T. `E2` must be a true, length-3 expression with no top-level `&` or `|`.\n    *   True `E2`s fitting this are `!!T` and `(T)`.\n    *   Expressions: `T&!!T` and `T&(T)`. (2 expressions)\n\n*   **Split (3, 1): `E1 & A`**. `A` must be T. `E1` must be a true, length-3 expression.\n    *   **Form `B&C & T`**: `E1 = B&C`. `B&C` must be True. Only `T&T` works. Gives `T&T&T`. (1 expression)\n    *   **Form `!!B & T`**: `E1 = !!B`. Must be True. So `!!T`. Gives `!!T&T`. (1 expression)\n    *   **Form `(B) & T`**: `E1 = (B)`. Must be True. So `(T)`. Gives `(T)&T`. (1 expression)\n    *   Total for (3,1): 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\n*   **Split (2, 2): `E1 & E2`**. `E1=!A`, `E2=!B`. Both must be True.\n    *   `!A` is True implies `A=F`. `!B` is True implies `B=F`.\n    *   Gives the single expression `!F&!F`. (1 expression)\n\nTotal count for Type C = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.\n\n**Count for Type C = 6**\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\n\nTotal number of true expressions is the sum of the counts for each type.\n\nTotal = (Count for P) + (Count for N) + (Count for D) + (Count for C)\nTotal = 6 + 15 + 32 + 6 = 59\n\n<<<59>>>"
