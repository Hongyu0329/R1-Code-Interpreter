$\delta\sigma = -\frac{e^2}{2\pi^{3/2}\hbar} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{D\tau_e}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{D\tau_\phi}} \right)$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant, $\tau_e$ is the elastic scattering time, and $\tau_\phi$ is the phase coherence time. The temperature-dependent part of this correction is $\Delta\sigma(T) = \frac{e^2}{2\pi^{3/2}\hbar L_\phi(T)}$, where $L_\phi = \sqrt{D\tau_\phi}$ is the phase coherence length.
