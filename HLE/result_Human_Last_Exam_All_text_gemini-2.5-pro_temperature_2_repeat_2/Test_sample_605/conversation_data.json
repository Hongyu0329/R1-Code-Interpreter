    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Problem and Given Information:**\n    *   We need to find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau Link.\n    *   The link is defined by the polynomial equation:\n        $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n    *   The ambient space is the 4-dimensional weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n    *   The weights are given as $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n2.  **Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition:**\n    *   A hypersurface in $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, \\dots, w_5)$ is a Calabi-Yau threefold if its weighted degree, $d$, is equal to the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$.\n    *   First, calculate the sum of the weights:\n        $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   Next, determine the degree of the defining polynomial. The polynomial must be quasihomogeneous, meaning all its monomials have the same weighted degree.\n        *   `deg`($z_1^8z_3$) = $8 \\times 22 + 1 \\times 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n        *   `deg`($z_1z_2^7$) = $1 \\times 22 + 7 \\times 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n        *   `deg`($z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$) = $22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n        *   `deg`($z_2z_3^4$) = $1 \\times 29 + 4 \\times 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n        *   `deg`($z_4^3z_5$) = $3 \\times 50 + 1 \\times 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n        *   `deg`($z_5^3$) = $3 \\times 75 = 225$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The monomial $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a weighted degree of $4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 1 \\times 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$. This conflicts with the other monomials. Given that the problem explicitly calls this a \"Calabi-Yau Link\" and all other terms, along with the sum of weights, point to a degree of 225, we will assume this term is a typo and proceed with $d=225$. The Crawley-Nordström invariant depends only on the weights, not the specific coefficients or exponents in the polynomial.\n    *   Since $d=225 = \\sum w_i$, the condition is met.\n\n3.  **Define the Crawley-Nordström Invariant:**\n    *   The invariant, denoted $c(X)$, is given by the formula:\n        $c(X) = N - L$\n    *   Here, $N$ is the number of distinct weights.\n    *   $L$ is the length of the maximal chain of divisibility among the weights. A chain is a sequence of weights $(w_{i_1}, w_{i_2}, \\dots, w_{i_k})$ such that $w_{i_1}$ divides $w_{i_2}$, which divides $w_{i_3}$, and so on ($w_{i_1} | w_{i_2} | \\dots | w_{i_k}$). $L$ is the maximum length, $k$, of such a chain.\n\n4.  **Calculate N (Number of Distinct Weights):**\n    *   The set of weights is $\\{22, 29, 49, 50, 75\\}$.\n    *   All five weights are unique.\n    *   Therefore, $N = 5$.\n\n5.  **Calculate L (Length of the Maximal Chain of Divisibility):**\n    *   We need to find the longest sequence of weights where each weight divides the next one in the sequence. To do this systematically, we check for divisibility between all pairs of distinct weights. Using prime factorizations helps:\n        *   $22 = 2 \\times 11$\n        *   $29$ (prime)\n        *   $49 = 7^2$\n        *   $50 = 2 \\times 5^2$\n        *   $75 = 3 \\times 5^2$\n    *   **Careful Point:** Check every pair for divisibility. For a number 'a' to divide 'b', all prime factors of 'a' must be prime factors of 'b', with exponents less than or equal to their exponents in 'b'.\n    *   Let's check:\n        *   Does 22 divide any other weight? No (e.g., 22 has a factor of 11, but no other weight does).\n        *   Does 29 divide any other weight? No (it's prime, and no other weight is a multiple of 29).\n        *   Does 49 divide any other weight? No (it requires a factor of 7, which no other weight has).\n        *   Does 50 divide any other weight? No.\n        *   Does 75 divide any other weight? No.\n    *   Since no weight in the set divides another distinct weight, we cannot form a chain of length 2 or greater. The longest possible chains are simply individual weights, which have a length of 1 (e.g., the chain (22)).\n    *   Therefore, the length of the maximal chain is $L = 1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Invariant:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the values of $N$ and $L$ into the formula:\n        $c(X) = N - L$\n        $c(X) = 5 - 1$\n        $c(X) = 4$\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
