    "This question pertains to the design of an imaging spectrometer based on the principles of computed tomography (CT), often known as a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS). Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal**: The objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\". This is a three-dimensional (3D) data cube, commonly represented as `f(x, y, λ)`, which contains the spectral information (`λ`) for every spatial pixel `(x, y)` in a scene.\n\n2.  **Understanding the Constraints**: The reconstruction must be performed from a \"single image\" captured on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor). This means the instrument must be a \"snapshot\" imaging spectrometer. The dispersing elements are restricted to \"diffraction gratings\".\n\n3.  **Understanding the Method**: The specified reconstruction method is \"computed tomography\". In medical CT, a 3D volume of an object is reconstructed from a series of 2D projection images (like X-rays) taken from many different angles around the object. The mathematical foundation for this is the Radon transform and its inversion.\n\n4.  **Applying CT to Spectroscopy (CTIS)**: In CTIS, the 3D object to be reconstructed is the spectral data cube `f(x, y, λ)`. The \"projections\" are not created by physically moving a source/detector. Instead, they are created optically and captured simultaneously on the single 2D detector.\n\n5.  **The Role of a Diffraction Grating**: A diffraction grating is an optical element that disperses light according to its wavelength.\n    *   An incoming beam of light is split into multiple beams called diffraction orders (labeled by an integer, m = 0, ±1, ±2, ...).\n    *   The **zeroth order (m=0)** is undispersed. It is essentially a conventional, panchromatic image of the scene. In the CTIS context, this corresponds to a projection of the data cube straight down the wavelength (`λ`) axis.\n    *   The **first orders (m=±1)** and higher orders are dispersed. The amount of spatial shift or \"smear\" for a point of light depends on its wavelength. These dispersed images are equivalent to projections of the data cube from different \"angles\".\n\n6.  **The \"Missing Cone\" Problem in Tomography**: A fundamental principle of computed tomography is that to accurately reconstruct a 3D object, you need projections from a wide range of non-coplanar angles. If all your projection angles lie in a single plane, you get what is known as the \"missing cone\" or \"missing wedge\" artifact. There is a cone-shaped region in the 3D Fourier transform of the object that is not sampled, and information within this cone cannot be recovered. This leads to an incomplete and inaccurate reconstruction.\n\n7.  **Analyzing a Single 1D Grating**: A standard diffraction grating is a 1D grating; it disperses light in only one direction (e.g., horizontally, along the x-axis).\n    *   This grating would produce a zeroth-order (undispersed) image and multiple dispersed orders (m=±1, ±2, etc.) along a single line on the detector.\n    *   In the language of tomography, the zeroth order is a projection along the λ-axis. The dispersed orders are projections from angles within the `x-λ` plane.\n    *   Since all the projections are confined to the `x-λ` plane, they are **coplanar**.\n    *   This setup suffers from the missing cone problem. It cannot capture information about the relationship between the `y` spatial dimension and the wavelength `λ`. Therefore, a \"full spectral volume\" cannot be reconstructed. **One 1D grating is insufficient.**\n\n8.  **Finding the Minimum Solution**: To overcome the missing cone problem, we need non-coplanar projections. This means we must introduce dispersion in a second, different direction (e.g., vertically, along the y-axis).\n    *   To achieve dispersion along the y-axis, a second grating, oriented perpendicularly to the first, is required.\n    *   With an x-grating and a y-grating, we can generate a 2D pattern of diffraction orders on the detector. For example, we can get orders like `(m_x, m_y) = (1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`.\n    *   The projection corresponding to order `(1, 0)` is in the `x-λ` plane, while the projection for `(0, 1)` is in the `y-λ` plane. These are non-coplanar projections.\n    *   This set of non-coplanar projections is sufficient to overcome the missing cone problem and allows for a tomographic reconstruction of the full `f(x, y, λ)` data cube.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   The key point is that tomographic reconstruction of a 3D volume requires non-coplanar projections.\n*   A single 1D diffraction grating can only produce coplanar projections, which is insufficient.\n*   To get non-coplanar projections, dispersion along at least two different (typically orthogonal) axes is necessary.\n*   Achieving dispersion along two axes requires the functionality of two separate diffraction gratings.\n*   In practice, these two grating structures are often combined into a single optical component called a \"2D diffraction grating\". However, from a fundamental physics and functional perspective, it embodies the action of two distinct gratings.\n*   Therefore, the minimum number of grating *functions* necessary is two.\n\nBased on this analysis, the minimum number of diffraction gratings (viewed as fundamental dispersive functions required by the physics of tomography) is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
