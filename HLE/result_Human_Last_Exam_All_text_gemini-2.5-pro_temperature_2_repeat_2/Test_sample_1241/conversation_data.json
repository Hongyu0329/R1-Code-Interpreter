    "This problem requires finding the steady-state probabilities of a continuous-time Markov chain defined by the Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations. We are asked to compute the sum of the probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 at equilibrium, i.e., $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\n\nAt steady state ($t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. This implies that their time derivatives are zero, $P_i'(t) = 0$. The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$ (Normalization condition)\n\nNote: In the second equation provided, the term for $P_0(t)$ is given as $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. This is inconsistent with the structure of Kolmogorov equations and the conservation of total probability. The sum of the derivatives must be zero, which is only possible if this term is positive, i.e., $\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. We proceed with this correction.\n\n**2. Solve the System of Linear Equations**\n\nWe can express the probabilities $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 = \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} \\pi_1$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} \\pi_1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$\\lambda_{31}\\pi_3 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\pi_2$\n\n**3. Substitute the Numerical Values**\n\nThe given values are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nLet's compute the coefficients for the probabilities:\n- For $\\pi_0$:\n  $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\pi_1$\n- For $\\pi_2$:\n  First, calculate the sum in the denominator: $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$.\n  $\\pi_2 = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} \\pi_1 = \\pi_1$\n- For $\\pi_3$:\n  $\\pi_3 = \\frac{0.008}{0.008} \\pi_2 = 1 \\cdot \\pi_2 = \\pi_2$. Since $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, we have $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\n\nSo we have found the simple relations: $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$ and $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\n\n**4. Use the Normalization Condition to Find $\\pi_1$**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19})\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19}\\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$**\n\nFirst, find $\\pi_0$:\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19} \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\nNow, compute the sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nTo get a numerical value, we perform the division:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to four decimal places, we get 0.9463.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Problem Identification**: The problem concerns finding the stationary (or limiting) distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain. This is indicated by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations and the limit $t \\to +\\infty$.\n2.  **Typo Correction**: The second equation likely contains a typo ($-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$). Assuming the standard form ($\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$) is crucial, as the original form leads to a contradiction with the probability normalization condition.\n3.  **Steady-State Formulation**: At steady state, the derivatives are zero ($P_i'(t) = 0$), transforming the system of ODEs into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n4.  **System Solving Strategy**: A standard strategy is to express all unknown probabilities in terms of a single one (e.g., $\\pi_1$) and then use the normalization condition ($\\sum \\pi_i = 1$) to find the value of that single probability.\n5.  **Numerical Simplifications**: The specific numerical values given for the rates lead to significant simplifications. Recognizing that $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = \\lambda_{12}$ and $\\lambda_{23} = \\lambda_{31}$ simplifies the relations to $\\pi_1=\\pi_2=\\pi_3$. Noticing this early prevents complex algebraic manipulation.\n6.  **Calculation Accuracy**: It's important to perform arithmetic accurately, especially when dealing with fractions and decimals. Using exact fractions for as long as possible helps maintain precision.\n7.  **Final Answer Precision**: The problem doesn't specify the required precision for the final answer. Presenting the result as an exact fraction ($\\frac{669}{707}$) is the most accurate form. A decimal representation requires choosing a reasonable number of decimal places for rounding (e.g., 4 or 5).\n8.  **Conceptual Check**: A qualitative check of the answer is useful. The low transition rate out of state 0 ($\\lambda_{01}=0.019$) compared to the rate back into it ($\\lambda_{10}=0.65$) suggests that the system should spend a large fraction of its time in state 0, making $\\pi_0$ large and the sum $\\pi_0+\\pi_1$ close to 1. The calculated value of $\\approx 0.946$ aligns with this expectation.\n\n<<<0.9463>>>"
