    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Source Material:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Scene:** The Junior Prom.\n*   **Subject:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Identity of Subject:** A fictional singer.\n*   **Goal:** To identify the name of this fictional singer.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or Research the Episode Content**\nThe next step is to access information about \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". This involves recalling the episode's plot or looking it up using a reliable source, such as the Homestar Runner Wiki or watching the episode itself.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the \"Junior Prom\" Scene**\nWithin the episode, there is a segment where the Teen Girl Squad attends their Junior Prom. We need to focus on what happens during this scene, specifically concerning the entertainment.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"Performer\"**\nThe scene clearly shows that the \"live\" entertainment at the prom is not a real person but a cardboard cutout standing on a stage.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Identity of the Cardboard Cutout**\nTo find the name, we can look at two key pieces of evidence within the scene:\n*   **Visual Cue:** A banner hangs at the prom that explicitly names the featured \"performer\". It reads, \"Featuring a cardboard cutout of KRAMPUS!\"\n*   **Audio/Dialogue Cue:** The character Cheerleader exclaims, \"OMG! It's a cardboard cutout of Krampus!\"\n\n**Step 6: Confirm the \"Fictional Singer\" Aspect**\nThe question specifies a \"fictional singer\". The dialogue among the girls confirms this. After Cheerleader identifies the cutout:\n*   So and So says: \"I heard he's not even a real singer.\"\n*   What's Her Face says: \"He's not even a real person.\"\nThis exchange confirms that Krampus is presented in the context of a musical performer for the prom (even if his status as a singer is questioned by the characters) and that he is a fictional figure within their universe.\n\n**Step 7: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the visual evidence of the banner and the direct dialogue from the characters in the specified scene, the name of the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout is Krampus.\n\n<<<Krampus>>>"
