**1) Hotspots for Interaction (Binding):**
The residues responsible for the direct physical interaction are located in the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the human beta-1b subunit (UniProt P54289-2) and form a binding pocket for the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID). The key hotspot residues are:
*   **Tyr233**
*   **Asp283**
*   **Trp311** (essential for high-affinity binding)
*   **Leu350**
*   **Tyr352**
*   **Asp353**
*   **Val401**
*   **Glu403**
*   **Ile405**

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Modulation):**
The regions and residues responsible for modulating the alpha-1 subunit's function are distinct from, though dependent on, the binding pocket.
*   **The N-terminal Domain:** For the beta-1b isoform, the entire N-terminus (approximately residues 1-58) is a critical hotspot. This domain is primarily responsible for modulating the kinetics and voltage-dependence of channel inactivation.
*   **Dual-Function Residues:** Certain residues in the binding pocket, such as **Asp353**, are also hotspots for modulation, as they are crucial for transducing the binding event into a change in channel gating.
*   **The SH3-GK Linker Region (Hook):** This variable linker region acts as a modulatory hotspot that fine-tunes the specific effects of the beta subunit on channel gating, contributing to isoform-specific regulation.
