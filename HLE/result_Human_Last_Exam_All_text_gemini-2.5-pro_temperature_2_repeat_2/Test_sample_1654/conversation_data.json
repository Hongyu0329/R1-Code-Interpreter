    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to count the number of times Anton Chekhov describes Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat in \"The Chameleon.\" The question correctly notes that these descriptions, primarily the actions of putting the coat on and taking it off, symbolize the shifts in his mentality.\n\n2.  **Identify the Symbolism:** The coat is a key symbol in the story.\n    *   **Wearing the coat:** Represents Otchumyelov's official authority, his blustering, and his intimidating persona. He puts it on when he feels secure in his power, usually when he believes the person involved is of a lower social class.\n    *   **Taking off the coat:** Represents his servility and fear. He takes it off when he is metaphorically \"sweating\" with anxiety that he might offend someone powerful, like General Zhigalov.\n\n3.  **Careful Walkthrough of the Story's Events:** To count the descriptions accurately, we must trace each time the coat is mentioned in relation to Otchumyelov's actions and state of mind.\n\n    *   **Instance 1 (Initial Description):** At the very beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced as he walks across the market square. Chekhov writes that he is wearing a \"new greatcoat.\" This establishes the coat as part of his identity.\n\n    *   **Instance 2 (Taking it off):** After the initial chaos, someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov. Fearing he might offend a powerful man, Otchumyelov's attitude shifts. He immediately feels hot and says to the policeman Yeldyrin, \"**Take my coat off...**\"\n\n    *   **Instance 3 (Putting it on):** The policeman, Yeldyrin, remarks that the dog is too shabby to be the General's. Otchumyelov's confidence returns. He feels a \"shivering\" chill and reverses his order: \"**Put my coat on...**\" He is back in his authoritative role.\n\n    *   **Instance 4 (Taking it off again):** Yeldyrin then speculates that he has seen a similar dog at the General's place, reviving the possibility of a powerful owner. Otchumyelov's fear returns instantly. He complains of the heat and says, \"**Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...**\"\n\n    *   **Instance 5 (Putting it on again):** The General's cook, Prokhor, arrives and states definitively that the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov, feeling secure again and ready to be the bully, feels a \"draught\" and tells Yeldyrin, \"**Help me on with my greatcoat...**\"\n\n    *   **Instance 6 (Final Action):** The story's final twist comes when Prokhor mentions that the dog actually belongs to the General's *brother*. This is still a connection to power, so Otchumyelov's demeanor becomes fawning and delighted. As he leaves, Chekhov gives a final description of his action with the coat: he walks away, \"**wrapping himself in his greatcoat...**\" This final act shows him snugly returning to his official shell, his mind at ease now that the social hierarchy is clear.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By methodically going through the story and tracking every instance where the coat is mentioned as either being worn, taken off, put on, or wrapped, we find a total of six distinct moments. Each one is deliberately placed by Chekhov to coincide with a shift in Otchumyelov's chameleon-like behaviour.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe descriptions of Otchumyelov's interactions with his greatcoat occur six times, each marking a shift in his attitude based on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n\n<<<6>>>"
