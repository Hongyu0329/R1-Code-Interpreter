    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to calculate the sum of symmetry factors for all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Diagrams\n\nFirst, we need to identify all distinct (non-isomorphic) connected Feynman diagrams for vacuum bubbles at second order in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n*   **Theory:** The interaction part of the Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$. This means each interaction vertex has 4 lines (legs) attached.\n*   **Order:** Second-order means there are two such vertices in each diagram ($n=2$).\n*   **Vacuum Bubbles:** These are diagrams with no external lines. All legs of the vertices must be connected to form internal lines (propagators).\n\nWith two vertices, each having 4 legs, we have a total of 8 legs to connect in pairs to form 4 propagators. We can systematically enumerate the possible connected graph topologies. Let the two vertices be $V_1$ and $V_2$. Let $L_{11}$ be the number of loops at $V_1$, $L_{22}$ be the number of loops at $V_2$, and $E_{12}$ be the number of propagators between $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n\nThe degree of each vertex must be 4. The degree formula for a vertex is: $d(V) = 2 \\times (\\text{number of loops at } V) + (\\text{number of lines connecting to other vertices})$.\nSo, we have:\n$d(V_1) = 2L_{11} + E_{12} = 4$\n$d(V_2) = 2L_{22} + E_{12} = 4$\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that $L_{11} = L_{22} = (4 - E_{12}) / 2$. Since $L_{11}$ must be a non-negative integer, $(4 - E_{12})$ must be an even, non-negative integer. Let's examine the possible integer values for $E_{12}$:\n\n1.  **If $E_{12} = 0$:** $L_{11} = L_{22} = 2$. The diagram consists of two separate vertices, each with two self-loops. This is not a connected diagram and therefore not a single vacuum bubble.\n2.  **If $E_{12} = 1$:** $4 - E_{12} = 3$, which is not even. This case is not possible.\n3.  **If $E_{12} = 2$:** $L_{11} = L_{22} = (4-2)/2 = 1$. This diagram has one self-loop at each vertex, and the two vertices are connected by two propagators. This is the **\"figure-eight\" diagram**.\n4.  **If $E_{12} = 3$:** $4 - E_{12} = 1$, which is not even. This case is not possible.\n5.  **If $E_{12} = 4$:** $L_{11} = L_{22} = (4-4)/2 = 0$. This diagram has no self-loops. The two vertices are connected by four propagators. This is often called the **\"melon\"** or **\"sunset\" diagram**.\n6.  **If $E_{12} > 4$:** This would require the degree of the vertices to be greater than 4, which is not possible.\n\nThus, there are exactly two distinct second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Symmetry Factor for the \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram\n\nThe symmetry factor $S$ for a diagram can be calculated by considering the combinatorics of forming the diagram from the initial Lagrangian terms. The overall contribution of diagrams of order $n$ is preceded by a factor of $\\frac{1}{n!}$. For second-order diagrams, this is $\\frac{1}{2!}$. The interaction vertex is $-\\frac{i\\lambda}{4!}$.\n\nThe amplitude of a given diagram is given by: $\\frac{1}{S} \\times (\\text{integral expression})$. Alternatively, the numerical part of the diagram's contribution is $\\frac{1}{2!} \\left(\\frac{1}{4!}\\right)^2 \\times (\\text{Number of Wick contractions for this topology})$. Then $S$ is the denominator of this fraction.\n\n*   **Number of Wick Contractions:** We have two vertices, $V_1$ and $V_2$, with fields $\\{\\phi_a, \\phi_b, \\phi_c, \\phi_d\\}$ at $V_1$ and $\\{\\phi_w, \\phi_x, \\phi_y, \\phi_z\\}$ at $V_2$.\n    1.  **Form the loop at $V_1$:** We need to choose 2 fields out of 4 to form a pair. The number of ways is $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n    2.  **Form the loop at $V_2$:** Similarly, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n    3.  **Connect the vertices:** We are left with 2 fields at $V_1$ and 2 fields at $V_2$. We must connect them. Let the remaining fields be $\\{A, B\\}$ at $V_1$ and $\\{C, D\\}$ at $V_2$. The possible pairings are $(A, C)$ and $(B, D)$, or $(A, D)$ and $(B, C)$. There are 2 ways.\n    4.  **Total number of contractions:** The total number of ways to form this specific topology is the product: $6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 72$.\n\n*   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:**\n    The overall numerical coefficient for this diagram is:\n    $\\frac{1}{2!} \\times \\frac{1}{(4!)^2} \\times 72 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{24 \\times 24} \\times 72 = \\frac{36}{576} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n    Thus, the symmetry factor $S_1$ for the figure-eight diagram is **16**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Symmetry Factor for the \"Melon\" Diagram\n\n*   **Number of Wick Contractions:** For this diagram, all 4 legs of $V_1$ connect to the 4 legs of $V_2$.\n    1.  Take the first field at $V_1$. It can be paired with any of the 4 fields at $V_2$. (4 ways)\n    2.  Take the second field at $V_1$. It can be paired with any of the remaining 3 fields at $V_2$. (3 ways)\n    3.  Take the third field at $V_1$. It can be paired with one of the remaining 2 fields at $V_2$. (2 ways)\n    4.  The last field at $V_1$ must be paired with the last one at $V_2$. (1 way)\n    5.  **Total number of contractions:** The total number of ways to form the melon diagram is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4! = 24$.\n\n*   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:**\n    The overall numerical coefficient for this diagram is:\n    $\\frac{1}{2!} \\times \\frac{1}{(4!)^2} \\times 24 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{576} \\times 24 = \\frac{12}{576} = \\frac{1}{48}$.\n    Thus, the symmetry factor $S_2$ for the melon diagram is **48**.\n    *Careful point:* This can be verified by the formula $S = p \\times \\prod_j k_j!$, where $p$ is the order of vertex permutations (here $p=2!$ for swapping the two identical vertices) and $k_j$ is the number of identical lines between any two vertices. Here, we have 4 identical lines connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$, so $k_1 = 4$. This gives $S = 2! \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Symmetry Factors\n\nThe question asks for the sum of the symmetry factors of all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams. We have found two such diagrams with symmetry factors $S_1=16$ and $S_2=48$.\n\nTotal Sum = $S_1 + S_2 = 16 + 48 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
