    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\n\nThe query asks for a specific film based on four key pieces of information:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character/Object:** A teenager riding a pink bike.\n4.  **Action:** The teenager pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points and Initial Brainstorming**\n\n*   **Pink Bike:** This is the most specific and unusual visual detail. Iconic movie bikes are common (e.g., in *E.T.*, *Pee-wee's Big Adventure*, *The Goonies*), but a specifically *pink* bike narrows the search considerably.\n*   **Teenager vs. Car:** This confrontation suggests a theme of youthful rebellion, defiance against authority, a game of \"chicken,\" or a desperate act. This is likely a memorable and pivotal scene.\n*   **Major Studio:** This helps eliminate smaller independent films, made-for-TV movies, or foreign films. Studios like Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount, Sony (Columbia), Disney, and their subsidiaries (like New Line Cinema) are the primary targets.\n*   **Potential Memory Conflation:** It's possible for a person's memory to combine two separate elements from the same movie or scene into one event. For example, remembering one character's defining object (the pink bike) being used by another character during a key moment of action.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Potential Candidates**\n\n*   ***It* (2017):** Features a group of teens (The Losers' Club) on bikes who confront bullies in a car (the \"Rock War\" scene). One character, Beverly Marsh, has a bike that is reddish/coral, which could be misremembered as pink. However, the action is a group fight, not a lone teenager pedaling *toward* a car. This is a close but not exact match.\n*   ***A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* (1985):** Features a main female character (Lisa) who has a bright pink Honda Spree moped/scooter. While a scooter can be colloquially called a \"bike,\" the specific scene of her riding it toward a car does not occur.\n*   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure* (1985):** The central object is a bicycle, but it is red and white, the protagonist is an adult (though childlike), and the plot does not feature this specific scene.\n*   ***Now and Then* (1995):** This film appears to be the strongest candidate.\n    1.  **Major Studio Film?** Yes, it was produced by New Line Cinema, a major production house and subsidiary of Warner Bros.\n    2.  **Teenager(s)?** Yes, the four main characters are 12-year-old girls on the cusp of their teenage years.\n    3.  **A Pink Bike?** Yes, unequivocally. The character Chrissy Dewitt has a very memorable pink bicycle with a white basket and streamers. This is a perfect match for the object.\n    4.  **Pedaling Toward/In Front of a Car?** Yes. There is a scene where the four girls are riding bikes side-by-side on a road. A car comes up behind them and honks aggressively. While Chrissy (on the pink bike) and two others move aside, the character Samantha Albertson (on a red bike) stays in the middle of the road, pedaling slowly in an act of defiance against the car.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe movie *Now and Then* contains every element described in the question, although the elements are split between two characters within the same scene. One teenager (Chrissy) is riding the pink bike, while another teenager in her immediate vicinity (Samantha) performs the act of defiance against the car. This common type of memory conflation makes *Now and Then* the only film that fits all the specific and unusual details of the query.\n\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
