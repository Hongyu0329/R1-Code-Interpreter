The local magnetic field is generally **not** considered radial at the L1 point. Due to the Sun's rotation, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) forms a Parker Spiral, which at the location of L1 (~1 AU) typically makes an angle of about 45 degrees with the radial direction.

The reason that magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction are often used to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is based on a practical and well-justified choice for data analysis, rooted in Taylor's "frozen-in" flow hypothesis.

The justification is as follows:
1.  **Dominant Radial Flow:** The solar wind flows past the L1 point at very high speed in an almost perfectly radial direction.
2.  **Taylor's Hypothesis:** This hypothesis states that for a fast flow, the time series of measurements from a stationary spacecraft can be interpreted as a one-dimensional spatial cut through the plasma along the direction of the flow. Therefore, the radial direction becomes the primary sampling direction for the instrument.
3.  **Analysis Frame vs. Physical Frame:** While the *physically correct* frame to analyze wave polarization is one aligned with the local magnetic field (the direction of wave propagation), the *practical analysis frame* is aligned with the solar wind flow (the direction of sampling).
4.  **Projected Helicity:** By using components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., Tangential and Normal components in an RTN system), one is calculating the helicity of the wave's magnetic field as it is projected onto the plane perpendicular to the solar wind flow.
5.  **Validity of the Approximation:** This projection is a good approximation for the primary goal: determining if the wave is left- or right-hand polarized. The sign of the helicity, which indicates the polarization, is robustly preserved as long as the magnetic field is not nearly perpendicular to the flow. At L1, with a typical angle of 45 degrees between the field and the flow, this condition is well met. While the calculated magnitude of the helicity might be an underestimate of the true value, its sign is reliable.

In summary, the choice is a convention based on the dominance of the radial solar wind flow, which simplifies the analysis while still providing a reliable determination of the wave polarization.
