    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the number of a specific ballet step (*entrelacé*) performed by a specific dancer (Natalia Osipova) in a specific role (Nikiya), scene (\"Death of Nikiya\"), company (Bolshoi Ballet), and year (2009 debut).\n\n2.  **Locate the Correct Performance:** The performance in question is Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in *La Bayadère* with the Bolshoi Ballet in November 2009. This is a well-documented performance available for viewing online.\n\n3.  **Isolate the Specific Variation:** The question specifies the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene. This occurs in Act 2 of *La Bayadère*. Within this scene, after being presented with a basket of flowers (hiding a venomous snake), Nikiya performs a sorrowful and dramatic solo variation. It is within this specific solo that we must count the steps.\n\n4.  **Define the Ballet Step:** An *entrelacé* (also known as a *tour jeté* or *jeté en tournant entrelacé*) is a turning leap. The dancer throws one leg into the air, jumps, and makes a half-turn in the air, \"scissoring\" their legs so they land on the leg that they first threw up. It is a very distinct and athletic step.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Choreography and Count:**\n    *   The variation begins with Nikiya expressing her grief.\n    *   She then launches into the main allegro (fast) section of her solo, which typically begins with a diagonal travelling sequence of powerful jumps.\n    *   Observing this diagonal sequence in Osipova's 2009 performance, we can see she performs a series of identical turning leaps.\n    *   By carefully counting each individual leap in this sequence from the beginning of the diagonal to its end, we can count them one-by-one.\n    *   She performs one *entrelacé*, followed immediately by another, and so on. The sequence consists of a total of six consecutive *entrelacés*.\n    *   After this diagonal of jumps, the choreography of the variation shifts to other steps, such as balances (arabesques), turns, and dramatic poses. There are no further *entrelacés* performed after this initial sequence.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of Performance:** It is crucial to analyze the 2009 Bolshoi debut performance, as choreography or a dancer's execution can vary slightly between performances, years, or ballet companies.\n*   **Correct Variation:** The count must be limited to the \"Death of Nikiya\" variation in Act 2, not any other solo she performs in the ballet (e.g., her entrance in Act 1 or her solo in the \"Kingdom of the Shades\" in Act 3).\n*   **Accurate Step Identification:** One must be careful not to confuse an *entrelacé* with other jumps like a *grand jeté* or *saut de basque*, which are different steps. Osipova performs a clear series of *entrelacés* in the specified part of the variation.\n*   **Meticulous Counting:** The jumps are performed quickly and in succession, so re-watching the sequence, potentially in slow motion, is necessary to ensure an accurate count.\n\nBased on the analysis of the choreography in the specified performance, the total number of *entrelacés* is six.\n\n<<<6>>>"
