The inner product $(\phi, D\phi)$ is given by the integral expression $\int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3\mathbf{x} \, \phi(\tau, \mathbf{x}) (-\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2) \phi(\tau, \mathbf{x})$, which is equivalent to $2S_E[\phi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3\mathbf{x} [(\partial_\tau\phi)^2 + (\nabla\phi)^2 + m^2\phi^2]$.
