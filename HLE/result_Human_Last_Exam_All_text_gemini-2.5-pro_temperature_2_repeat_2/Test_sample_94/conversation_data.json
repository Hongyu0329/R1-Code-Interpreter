    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific physicist. Let's break down the clues provided:\n*   **Profession:** Physicist.\n*   **Primary Field:** Better known for work in microscopy.\n*   **Discovery:** An optical effect.\n*   **Context of Discovery:** The effect was seen in \"real imagery\".\n*   **Origin Story:** It was first accidentally observed by a custodial worker.\n*   **The Object Involved:** The worker was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Most Unique Clue**\nThe most specific and unusual piece of information is the anecdote about the custodial worker accidentally observing an effect while cleaning concave mirrors. This is a very specific historical detail that will be the key to identifying the physicist.\n\n**Step 3: Research the Anecdote**\nA search for a discovery related to a janitor or custodial worker cleaning a concave mirror points to a well-known story in the history of optics. The story is about the inspiration behind the development of the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Anecdote to a Physicist and an Effect**\nThe physicist associated with this story is **Frits Zernike**. The story goes that a janitor was polishing a large concave mirror in Zernike's laboratory. The janitor noticed faint, strange patterns of light and shadow appearing on a nearby wall (the real image formed by the mirror). He pointed this out to Zernike. Zernike realized that the streaks and smudges from the cleaning process, though nearly transparent, were causing minute shifts in the *phase* of the reflected light. These phase shifts, normally invisible to the human eye, were being rendered as visible differences in brightness (amplitude) at the image plane.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Physicist against the Other Clues**\nNow, let's check if Frits Zernike matches the other parts of the question:\n*   **Physicist?** Yes, Frits Zernike (1888-1966) was a Dutch physicist.\n*   **Better known for work in the microscopy field?** Yes, this is his most famous contribution. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935 for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope, which allows for the imaging of transparent specimens without staining.\n*   **Discovered an optical effect?** Yes, he didn't discover phase shifts themselves, but he discovered a method (phase contrast) to make them visible, a groundbreaking optical principle.\n*   **In real imagery?** Yes, the initial observation was made in the real image projected by the concave mirror onto a wall.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nAll the details in the question align perfectly with Frits Zernike and the story of the inspiration for his Nobel Prize-winning invention. He is a physicist, primarily known for microscopy, who formulated a new optical principle after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning a concave mirror.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
