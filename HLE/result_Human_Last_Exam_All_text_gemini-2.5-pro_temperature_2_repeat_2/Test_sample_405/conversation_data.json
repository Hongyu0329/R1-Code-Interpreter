    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors that can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question**\nThe question asks for the total number of distinct colors that are exhibited by the various *pure allotropes* of the element phosphorus. This requires identifying the known allotropes and then determining the color of each.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the known allotropes of phosphorus**\nPhosphorus is known for existing in several different structural forms called allotropes. The most well-known are white, red, and black phosphorus. However, other distinct allotropes have been synthesized and characterized. We need to list all the established pure allotropes.\n1.  White Phosphorus\n2.  Red Phosphorus\n3.  Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's Phosphorus)\n4.  Black Phosphorus\n5.  Blue Phosphorus\n\n**Step 3: Determine the observed color of each pure allotrope**\nNow, we will examine the characteristic color of each identified allotrope.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus (P₄):** In its pure form, this allotrope is a translucent, waxy solid that is colorless or **white**. However, upon exposure to light, it undergoes a slow transformation to the more stable red allotrope, which gives it a **yellowish** hue. Because it is most commonly encountered and referred to as \"yellow phosphorus\", it's important to consider this appearance. For the purpose of counting colors, white/yellow can be considered a single color category associated with this allotrope.\n    *   Color 1: **White/Yellow**\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This is a polymer and is significantly more stable than white phosphorus. As its name implies, its color is **red**. The shade can vary from orange to a deep purplish-red depending on factors like particle size.\n    *   Color 2: **Red**\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):** This is a specific crystalline, polymeric form of phosphorus. It is obtained through a process of crystallizing phosphorus from molten lead. It has a distinct color.\n    *   Color 3: **Violet**\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus under standard conditions. It has a layered structure similar to graphite and is a semiconductor. Its appearance is also similar to graphite.\n    *   Color 4: **Black**\n\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a more recently discovered 2D allotrope, a structural relative of graphene (a single layer of black phosphorus is often called phosphorene, but blue phosphorus has a different atomic arrangement). It has been synthesized on substrates.\n    *   Color 5: **Blue**\n\n**Step 4: Tally the distinct colors**\nBy listing the colors associated with each distinct pure allotrope, we can count the total number of observable colors.\n1.  White/Yellow (from White Phosphorus)\n2.  Red (from Red Phosphorus)\n3.  Violet (from Violet Phosphorus)\n4.  Black (from Black Phosphorus)\n5.  Blue (from Blue Phosphorus)\n\nCounting these distinct colors gives a total of 5.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Purity:** The question specifies *pure* allotropes. Some named forms, like \"brown phosphorus,\" are generally considered impure or less-defined amorphous versions of red phosphorus and are therefore excluded from this count.\n*   **Distinct Allotropes:** We only count colors from structurally distinct allotropes. \"Scarlet phosphorus,\" for example, is a finely divided form of red phosphorus, not a different allotrope, so its color falls under the \"red\" category.\n*   **White vs. Yellow Phosphorus:** White phosphorus (P₄) is the same allotrope whether it appears pure white or yellow from slight decomposition. Thus, it contributes only one color category (white/yellow) to our count.\n*   **Exclusion of Gaseous Forms:** The gaseous allotrope diphosphorus (P₂) is not a stable solid or liquid under normal conditions and does not have a \"color\" in the conventional sense of a bulk material, so it is not included in the count.\n\nBased on the analysis of the five well-established, distinct, pure allotropes of phosphorus, we can conclude there are five observable colors.\n\n<<<5>>>"
