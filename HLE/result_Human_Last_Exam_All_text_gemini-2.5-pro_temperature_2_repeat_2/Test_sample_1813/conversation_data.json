    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem asks for the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) for the specific rational number \\( p/q = 4/7 \\). This \"associated continued fraction\" refers to the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\( \\alpha_{p/q} \\), from which the value \\( m_{p/q} \\) is derived. The continued fraction of \\( \\alpha_{p/q} \\) is purely periodic, meaning it can be written as \\( [0; \\overline{P}] \\), where \\( P \\) is a palindromic sequence of positive integers. Our goal is to find this sequence \\( P \\).\n\n### Step 2: The Algorithm\nThere is a well-established algorithm to find the periodic part \\( P \\) of the continued fraction for \\( \\alpha_{p/q} \\). The algorithm depends on the standard continued fraction of \\( p/q \\) itself.\n\n1.  **Find the continued fraction of \\( p/q \\).**\n    Let the continued fraction of \\( p/q \\) be \\( [0; c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k] \\), where \\( (c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_k) \\) is the sequence of partial quotients. We assume \\( p<q \\).\n\n2.  **Construct the palindromic period \\( P \\).**\n    The construction of \\( P \\) depends on the parity of \\( k \\), the number of partial quotients.\n    *   **If \\( k \\) is odd:** Let \\( c = (c_1, \\ldots, c_k) \\). The period \\( P \\) is formed by concatenating \\( c \\) with its reverse, \\( \\text{rev}(c) \\).\n        \\( P = (c_1, \\ldots, c_k, c_k, \\ldots, c_1) \\).\n    *   **If \\( k \\) is even:** Let \\( c = (c_1, \\ldots, c_k) \\). The construction is slightly more complex.\n        \\( P = (c_1, \\ldots, c_{k-1}, c_k - 1, 1, c_k - 1, c_{k-1}, \\ldots, c_1) \\).\n\n3.  **State the final continued fraction.**\n    The resulting continued fraction is \\( [\\overline{P}] \\) or \\( [0; \\overline{P}] \\).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Algorithm to \\( m_{4/7} \\)\n\n1.  **Compute the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\).**\n    We use the Euclidean algorithm:\n    \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n    \\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n    \\( \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\)\n    So, the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n    The sequence of partial quotients is \\( c = (c_1, c_2, c_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n\n2.  **Determine the parity of \\( k \\).**\n    The number of partial quotients is \\( k=3 \\), which is an odd number.\n\n3.  **Construct the period \\( P \\).**\n    Since \\( k \\) is odd, we use the formula \\( P = (c_1, \\ldots, c_k, c_k, \\ldots, c_1) \\).\n    With \\( c = (1, 1, 3) \\), we have:\n    \\( P = (c_1, c_2, c_3, c_3, c_2, c_1) \\)\n    Substituting the values:\n    \\( P = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\)\n\n4.  **Final continued fraction.**\n    The periodic part is \\( (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\). The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is \\( [\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Correct CF of \\( p/q \\):** The initial step of finding the continued fraction of the rational number must be accurate. Forgetting the initial `0;` part for \\(p<q\\) can lead to confusion, but the relevant part is the sequence \\( c \\).\n*   **Parity of \\( k \\):** Correctly identifying whether \\(k\\) is odd or even is crucial as it determines which rule to apply.\n*   **Correct Rule:** There are two distinct rules for odd and even \\( k \\). Applying the wrong one will lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Palindromes and Primitiveness:** The resulting sequence \\(P\\) is always a palindrome. In some cases (when the original sequence \\(c\\) is a palindrome and \\(k\\) is odd, or for \\(k=1\\)), the resulting sequence \\(P\\) may not be \"primitive\", meaning it can be written as a smaller block repeated (e.g., \\( (3,3) \\)). However, \\( [0;\\overline{3,3}] \\) represents the same number as \\( [0;\\overline{3}] \\). For our specific problem, \\(c = (1,1,3)\\) is not a palindrome, so the resulting period \\(P = (1,1,3,3,1,1)\\) is primitive.\n*   **Final Answer Format:** The question asks for \"the continued fraction\". This is typically represented by the repeating block of its coefficients.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward and follows the established procedure. The steps have been double-checked for accuracy.\n\n<<<[ \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1} ]>>>"
