    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"**\nThe Second Great War is the name given to the sector-wide conflict that encompasses the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy: *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*. It is a distinct conflict from the original \"Great War\" and the subsequent \"Brood War\" from the first *StarCraft* game and its expansion.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Start Date of the War**\nThe war began in the year **2504**. This is marked by the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, particularly the attack on the Terran world of Mar Sara. This event kicks off the campaign of *Wings of Liberty*, where Jim Raynor and his Raiders begin their fight against both the Zerg and the Terran Dominion.\n\n**Step 3: Establish the End Date of the War**\nThe war concluded in the year **2506**. The final act of the war is depicted in the epilogue campaign of *Legacy of the Void*, titled \"Into the Void.\" In this campaign, the unified forces of the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg venture into the Void to defeat the fallen Xel'naga, Amon, once and for all. His destruction marks the definitive end of the Second Great War.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Elapsed Time**\nThe war started sometime within the year 2504 and ended sometime within the year 2506. To calculate the duration, we consider the time that passed.\n\n*   A portion of the year **2504** was spent at war (*Wings of Liberty* and the beginning of *Heart of the Swarm*).\n*   The entire year of **2505** was spent at war (*Heart of the Swarm*'s conclusion and the main events of *Legacy of the Void*).\n*   A portion of the year **2506** was spent at war (the final stages of *Legacy of the Void* and the \"Into the Void\" epilogue).\n\nThis means the total duration is greater than the full year of 2505 plus the partial years of 2504 and 2506. Given the significant length of each game's campaign, the total time elapsed is certainly more than two full years. For example, if the war started in March 2504 and ended in April 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 1 month.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Rounding Rule**\nThe question requires the duration in years, **rounded up**. Since the calculated duration is definitively greater than 2 years (e.g., 2.x years), rounding this value up to the nearest whole number gives us 3.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Distinguishing Wars:** It's crucial not to confuse the Second Great War (*StarCraft II*) with the Great War/Brood War (*StarCraft I*), which occurred from 2500-2501.\n2.  **Lore-Based Timeline:** The calculation relies on the established in-game lore calendar years (2504-2506), not on the real-world release dates of the games.\n3.  **Understanding Duration vs. Year Span:** The war *spanned* three calendar years (2504, 2505, 2506), but this doesn't automatically mean it lasted three full years. However, the calculation of elapsed time confirms the duration is a value greater than 2.0.\n4.  **Strict Interpretation of \"Rounded Up\":** Any duration that is not a whole number must be rounded to the next highest integer. Since the war's length is confirmed to be greater than two years, it must be rounded up to three.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n*   Start Year: 2504\n*   End Year: 2506\n*   Elapsed Time: (Portion of 2504) + (All of 2505) + (Portion of 2506) > 2.0 years.\n*   Rounded Up Duration: 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
