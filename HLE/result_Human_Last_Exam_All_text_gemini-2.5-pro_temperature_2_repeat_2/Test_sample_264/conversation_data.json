    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Coordinate System and the First Cube**\n\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard 3D Cartesian coordinate system. The most convenient placement is to have one vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1).\n\n*   **Cube A:** A point `(x, y, z)` is inside or on the surface of Cube A if its coordinates satisfy the following inequalities:\n    *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\nThe side length of Cube A is 1, and its volume is `1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n### **Step 2: Interpret the Shift and Define the Second Cube**\n\nThe problem states the second cube, Cube B, is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to the first.\n\n*   **Main Diagonal:** For Cube A positioned as above, the main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin `(0, 0, 0)` to the opposite vertex `(1, 1, 1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is `<1, 1, 1>`.\n*   **The Shift:** A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most naturally interpreted as a translation by the vector `1/2 * <1, 1, 1>`, which is `<1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n*   **Cube B:** To find the position of Cube B, we apply this translation to the coordinates of Cube A. A point `(x, y, z)` is inside Cube B if the point `(x - 1/2, y - 1/2, z - 1/2)` would have been in Cube A. This gives us the new set of inequalities for Cube B:\n    *   `0 ≤ x - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 ≤ y - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 ≤ z - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Region of Intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the set of all points `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B simultaneously. We find the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:**\n    *   From Cube A: `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   From Cube B: `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   The intersection of these two ranges is `max(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)`, which simplifies to `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **For the y-coordinate:**\n    *   From Cube A: `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   From Cube B: `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   Similarly, the intersection is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **For the z-coordinate:**\n    *   From Cube A: `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n    *   From Cube B: `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n    *   Similarly, the intersection is `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\nThe resulting region of intersection is a rectangular prism (specifically, a cube) defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n\nNow we calculate the volume of this intersection region. The shape is a cube, and we can find its side lengths from the coordinate ranges.\n\n*   **Side length in the x-direction:** `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   **Side length in the y-direction:** `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   **Side length in the z-direction:** `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of the intersection is the product of these side lengths:\nVolume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Placement of the First Cube:** Placing the cube at `[0,1]x[0,1]x[0,1]` simplifies the coordinate definitions.\n2.  **Interpreting the Shift:** The crucial step is correctly interpreting \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\" The standard interpretation is a component-wise shift, resulting in a translation vector of `<1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n3.  **Finding Intersection Bounds:** For each dimension, the new range is found by taking the maximum of the lower bounds and the minimum of the upper bounds.\n4.  **Final Volume Calculation:** The intersection forms a smaller cube, whose volume is easily calculated as `side³`.\n\nFinal Answer: The volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
