To be functionally accurate, the table must change its shape. When the sun rises and exposes it to UV light, the table must change from its elongated and relatively straight *trans* form to a bent, V-shaped *cis* form. When the sun sets and it becomes dark, the table must thermally relax back from the bent *cis* form to the more stable, elongated *trans* form.
