    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the structure of $\\Delta$\n\n1.  **Objects and Morphisms:** The simplex category, $\\Delta$, has objects which are finite non-empty ordinals, denoted as $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. The morphisms are order-preserving maps between these sets. A map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a morphism if for all $i, j \\in [n]$, $i \\le j$ implies $f(i) \\le f(j)$.\n\n2.  **The 2-Category Structure:** The problem specifies that $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$ (the category of posets).\n    *   This means each object $[n]$ is a poset under its natural ordering.\n    *   For any two morphisms $f, g: [n] \\to [m]$, we define a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ to exist if and only if $f(k) \\le g(k)$ for all $k \\in [n]$.\n    *   This relation `â‰¤` on the set of morphisms $\\text{Hom}([n], [m])$ forms a partial order, making each hom-set a poset. A category where the hom-sets are posets is called a poset-enriched category or a locally posetal 2-category.\n\n### Step 2: Defining an Internal Adjunction in $\\Delta$\n\n1.  **General Definition:** In a 2-category, an adjunction between two objects $A$ and $B$ consists of a pair of morphisms $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$, and two 2-morphisms called the unit ($\\eta: \\text{id}_A \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$) and the counit ($\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_B$), which must satisfy certain coherence conditions (the triangle identities).\n\n2.  **Adjunction in $\\Delta$:** Since $\\Delta$ is locally posetal, the 2-morphisms are simply inequalities.\n    *   The unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[n]} \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$ becomes the condition $\\text{id}_{[n]} \\le g \\circ f$. Pointwise, this means $k \\le (g \\circ f)(k)$ for all $k \\in [n]$.\n    *   The counit $\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_{[m]}$ becomes the condition $f \\circ g \\le \\text{id}_{[m]}$. Pointwise, this means $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [m]$.\n    *   The triangle identities are automatically satisfied in any poset-enriched category.\n\n3.  **Galois Connection:** The conditions on the pair of order-preserving maps $(f,g)$ are precisely the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $([n], \\le)$ and $([m], \\le)$. So, an internal adjunction in $\\Delta$ from $[n]$ to $[m]$ is the same as a Galois connection between these posets.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing the Adjoint Maps\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint map $f$ or its right adjoint map $g$. We can find necessary and sufficient conditions for an order-preserving map to be part of an adjunction.\n\n1.  **Characterizing the Left Adjoint $f$:** An order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a left adjoint in a Galois connection if and only if it has a right adjoint $g$. This right adjoint would be defined by $g(j) = \\max\\{k \\in [n] \\mid f(k) \\le j\\}$. For $g(j)$ to be well-defined for all $j \\in [m]$, the set $\\{k \\in [n] \\mid f(k) \\le j\\}$ must be non-empty. This is guaranteed if we can find at least one element in the set for any $j$. Taking $k=0$, the element $f(0)$ must be small enough. The condition $f(0)=0$ ensures that for any $j \\in [m]$, $f(0)=0 \\le j$, so the set contains $0$ and is non-empty. Conversely, for an adjunction $(f,g)$, we have $f(g(j)) \\le j$. For $j=0$, this implies $f(g(0)) \\le 0$, so $f(g(0)) = 0$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, this requires $f(0)=0$.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** An order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is the left adjoint of an adjunction if and only if **$f(0)=0$**.\n\n2.  **Characterizing the Right Adjoint $g$:** Similarly, an order-preserving map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it has a left adjoint $f$. This left adjoint would be defined by $f(k) = \\min\\{j \\in [m] \\mid k \\le g(j)\\}$. For $f(k)$ to be well-defined for all $k \\in [n]$, the set must be non-empty. The condition $g(m)=n$ ensures this: for any $k \\in [n]$, we have $k \\le n=g(m)$, so the set contains $m$ and is non-empty. Conversely, for an adjunction $(f,g)$, we have $k \\le g(f(k))$. For $k=n$, this gives $n \\le g(f(n))$. Since the codomain of $g$ is $[n]$, this means $g(f(n))=n$. Since $g$ is order-preserving, $g(m) \\ge g(f(n)) = n$, so $g(m)=n$.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** An order-preserving map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ is the right adjoint of an adjunction if and only if **$g(m)=n$**.\n\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of adjunctions from $[n]$ to $[m]$ and the set of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ with $f(0)=0$. It also establishes a bijection with the set of order-preserving maps $g: [m] \\to [n]$ with $g(m)=n$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Adjunctions\n\nThe problem asks for the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. Here, $n=23$ and $m=37$. We can count either of the sets of maps described above. Let's use the condition on $g$.\n\n1.  **Counting suitable maps $g$:** We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $g(37) = 23$.\n    *   An order-preserving map $g: [37] \\to [23]$ is a sequence of values $(g(0), g(1), \\ldots, g(37))$ such that $0 \\le g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\ldots \\le g(37) \\le 23$.\n    *   The condition $g(37)=23$ fixes the last value. The condition becomes: $0 \\le g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\ldots \\le g(36) \\le 23$.\n    *   We are therefore counting the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 37 (from index 0 to 36). The values are chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 23\\}$, which has $24$ elements.\n\n2.  **Combinatorial Formulation:** This is a classic \"stars and bars\" or \"combination with repetition\" problem. We are choosing $k=37$ items (the values for $g(0), \\ldots, g(36)$) from a set of $r=24$ possible values (the numbers $0, \\ldots, 23$), where repetition is allowed and order is determined by the non-decreasing condition. The number of ways to do this is:\n    $$ \\binom{r+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\n\n### Step 5: Verification\n\nAs a sanity check, we can also count the suitable maps $f$.\n1.  **Counting suitable maps $f$:** We need to count order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $f(0)=0$.\n    *   An order-preserving map $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is a sequence $(f(0), \\ldots, f(23))$ where $0 \\le f(0) \\le \\ldots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n    *   The condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first value. The condition becomes: $0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\ldots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n    *   We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, namely $(f(1), \\ldots, f(23))$. The values are chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 37\\}$, which has $38$ elements.\n2.  **Combinatorial Formulation:** We are choosing $k=23$ items from a set of $r=38$ possible values. The number of ways is:\n    $$ \\binom{r+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nThe two results are consistent because of the binomial identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$:\n$$ \\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nThis confirms our analysis is correct. The number of adjunctions is this value.\n\nFinal calculation is not needed, the expression itself is the answer."
