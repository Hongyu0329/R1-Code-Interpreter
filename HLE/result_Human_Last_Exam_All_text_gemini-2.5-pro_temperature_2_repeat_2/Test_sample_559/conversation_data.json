    "An analysis of the system of differential equations is performed step-by-step to find the separatrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe given system of differential equations is:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$\n2.  $u'(t) = u^2(t)(u(t)-1)$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$. Equilibrium points are solutions to $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = 0$, we have $u^2(u-1) = 0$, which yields $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into $d'(t) = 0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into $d'(t) = 0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n    This yields $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$) are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Equilibrium Points using Linearization**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$ of the system:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each non-zero equilibrium point.\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3 + 10)d - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, **(0, 1) is an unstable node (source)**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3 + 10)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are both zero, so this point is non-hyperbolic and requires further analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. We will analyze the manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1).\n\nA separatrix can often be represented by a simple analytical function. We can look for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$. The differential equation for trajectories in the phase plane is $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$. An invariant curve must satisfy the equation $f'(u)u' = 2(f(u))^2 + (-3u+5u^2)f(u) - u^3(1-u)$.\n\nLet's test for a simple polynomial solution, for instance $d = cu^2$.\nThen $d' = \\frac{d}{dt}(cu^2) = 2cu \\cdot u'$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $d'$:\n$2cu \\cdot u' = 2(cu^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(cu^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$2cu(u^2(u-1)) = 2c^2u^4 + (-3cu^3 + 5cu^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n$2cu^4 - 2cu^3 = 2c^2u^4 - 3cu^3 + 5cu^4 - u^3 + u^4$\nGroup terms by powers of $u$:\n$2cu^4 - 2cu^3 = (2c^2 + 5c + 1)u^4 + (-3c - 1)u^3$\nFor this equation to hold for all $u$, the coefficients of each power of $u$ must be equal:\n1.  Coefficient of $u^4$: $2c = 2c^2 + 5c + 1 \\implies 2c^2 + 3c + 1 = 0$\n2.  Coefficient of $u^3$: $-2c = -3c - 1 \\implies c = -1$\n\nNow, we check if $c=-1$ satisfies the first equation:\n$2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 1 = 2 - 3 + 1 = 0$.\nThe condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, the curve defined by the equation **$d = -u^2$** is an invariant curve, meaning it is a trajectory of the system.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that the curve is a separatrix**\n\nLet's check if this invariant curve passes through any of the equilibrium points.\n*   For the saddle point (-1, 1): If $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point.\n*   For the equilibrium point (0, 0): If $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. The curve passes through the origin.\n\nThe curve $d=-u^2$ connects the saddle point (-1, 1) to the equilibrium point (0, 0). A trajectory connecting two equilibrium points, one of which is a saddle, is a separatrix. Specifically, it must be part of the stable or unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nTo determine which one, we check the direction of flow. For $u \\in (0,1)$, we have $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) < 0$. This means that $u(t)$ decreases over time. On the curve $d=-u^2$, this implies the flow is from the point where $u=1$ (i.e., (-1, 1)) towards the point where $u=0$ (i.e., (0, 0)).\nA trajectory that moves away from a saddle point as time increases belongs to its unstable manifold.\nTherefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ for $u \\in [0, 1]$ is one of the two branches of the unstable manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1). As a branch of the unstable manifold of a saddle, it is by definition a separatrix.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{d=-u^2}$."
