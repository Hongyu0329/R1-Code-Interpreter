    "This problem requires finding the observer canonical form of a multi-output discrete-time system by using the principle of duality. The key idea is that transforming a system `(A, C)` to observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` is dual to transforming its dual system `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)` to controller canonical form `(A_dc, B_dc)`.\n\nThe relationship between the canonical forms is:\n`A_o = (A_dc)^T`\n`C_o = (B_dc)^T`\n\nOur goal is to find the new matrix `C_o`. Therefore, we need to determine the controller canonical form matrix `B_dc` for the dual system and then transpose it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Original and Dual Systems**\n\nThe original system is given by:\n`A = [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0]`\n`C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]`\n\nThe dual system `(A_d, B_d)` is defined by:\n`A_d = A^T = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0]`\n`B_d = C^T = [0, 1; 1, 1; 0, 0]`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Observability Indices of the Original System**\n\nThe structure of the canonical form depends on the system's indices. The observability indices `(ν₁, ν₂)` of the original system `(A, C)` are the same as the controllability indices `(μ₁, μ₂)` of the dual system `(A_d, B_d)`. We determine the observability indices by finding the number of linearly independent rows in the observability matrix `Q_o`, selected in a specific order.\n\nThe observability matrix is `Q_o = [C; C*A; C*A^2; ...]`.\nLet the two rows of `C` be `c₁` and `c₂`:\n`c₁ = [0, 1, 0]`\n`c₂ = [1, 1, 0]`\n\nNow, compute `C*A`:\n`C*A = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0] * [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0] = [2, 1, 1; 3, 2, 1]`\nLet the rows of `C*A` be `c₁A` and `c₂A`:\n`c₁A = [2, 1, 1]`\n`c₂A = [3, 2, 1]`\n\nWe select linearly independent rows in the order `c₁, c₂, c₁A, c₂A, ...` until we have `n=3` independent rows.\n1.  Select `c₁ = [0, 1, 0]`.\n2.  Select `c₂ = [1, 1, 0]`. It is linearly independent from `c₁`.\n3.  Select `c₁A = [2, 1, 1]`. Let's check for linear independence with `c₁` and `c₂`.\n    `det([0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1]) = 0 - 1*(1*1 - 0*2) + 0 = -1 ≠ 0`.\n    So, `{c₁, c₂, c₁A}` forms a set of 3 linearly independent vectors. We stop here.\n\nNow, we count the number of rows selected from each original output's chain:\n*   From the chain of output 1 (`c₁`, `c₁A`, ...): We selected `c₁` and `c₁A`. So, the observability index `ν₁ = 2`.\n*   From the chain of output 2 (`c₂`, `c₂A`, ...): We selected `c₂`. So, the observability index `ν₂ = 1`.\n\nThe observability indices are `(ν₁, ν₂) = (2, 1)`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The sum of indices `ν₁ + ν₂ = 2 + 1 = 3` must equal the state dimension `n`, which it does. The order of selection matters, and the standard procedure used here determines the structure of the canonical form.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Controller Canonical Form Matrix B_dc for the Dual System**\n\nThe controllability indices `(μ₁, μ₂)` for the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` are equal to `(ν₁, ν₂) = (2, 1)`.\nFor a multi-input system with `n=3` states, `m=2` inputs, and controllability indices `μ₁=2, μ₂=1`, the controller canonical matrix `B_dc` has a specific structure. In the Luenberger canonical form, the j-th column of `B_dc` is a standard basis vector `e_k` where `k` is the cumulative sum of indices up to `j`.\n\n*   For the first input (`j=1`), the `1` is placed at row `k = μ₁ = 2`. The first column of `B_dc` is `e₂ = [0; 1; 0]`.\n*   For the second input (`j=2`), the `1` is placed at row `k = μ₁ + μ₂ = 2 + 1 = 3`. The second column of `B_dc` is `e₃ = [0; 0; 1]`.\n\nCombining these columns, we get:\n`B_dc = [0, 0; 1, 0; 0, 1]`\n\n**Step 4: Find the Observer Canonical Form Matrix C_o using Duality**\n\nThe duality principle states that `C_o = (B_dc)^T`.\nTaking the transpose of `B_dc`:\n`C_o = [0, 0; 1, 0; 0, 1]^T = [0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1]`\n\nThis is the output matrix for the system in observer canonical form.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the value of the new matrix C in observer canonical form.\n\n<<<[0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1]>>>"
