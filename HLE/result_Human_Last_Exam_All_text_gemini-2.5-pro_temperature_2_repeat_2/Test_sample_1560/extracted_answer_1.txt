The final state is not a single state but one of five possibilities, depending on the measurement outcome. If ququint A is measured, the system collapses as follows:
- With probability 1/5, the measurement outcome is 0, and the final state is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B+|3\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 1/5, the measurement outcome is 1, and the final state is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B+|2\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 3/10, the measurement outcome is 2, and the final state is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B+|3\rangle_B+|4\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 1/5, the measurement outcome is 3, and the final state is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B+|4\rangle_B)$.
- With probability 1/10, the measurement outcome is 4, and the final state is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
