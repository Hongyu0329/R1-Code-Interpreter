    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Interpret the Given Information**\n\nFirst, we need to decode the value of `S`. The problem states $S = SNYWR$. In this context, `S` represents the length of the string \"SNYWR\". Counting the characters, we find that the length is 5.\nSo, the problem can be restated as:\nIn a triangle $A B C$, side $B C=5$ and the measure of angle $B$ is $30^{\\circ}$. We need to find the number of possible integer values for the length of side $AC$ for which there can be two different possible triangles (which means two possible lengths for side $AB$).\n\nLet's use the standard notation for a triangle:\n*   $a = BC = 5$\n*   $b = AC$\n*   $c = AB$\n*   $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$\n\nThe question asks for the number of integer values of $b$ such that there are two possible values for $c$.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Ambiguous Case of the Law of Sines**\n\nThis problem describes the \"Side-Side-Angle\" (SSA) case, which is known as the ambiguous case in trigonometry. When two sides and a non-included angle are given, there can be zero, one, or two possible triangles. The number of triangles depends on the length of the side opposite the given angle ($b = AC$) compared to the length of the other given side ($a = BC$) and the altitude from vertex C.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Altitude of the Triangle**\n\nLet's find the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$. Let's call this altitude $h$. In the right-angled triangle formed by dropping the altitude from C, we have:\n$h = a \\cdot \\sin(B)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$h = 5 \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ})$\nSince $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 1/2$, the altitude is:\n$h = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5$\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Conditions for the Ambiguous Case**\n\nThe number of possible triangles in the SSA case depends on the comparison of side $b$ (the side opposite the given angle) with the altitude $h$ and the other given side $a$.\n\n*   **No triangle:** If $b < h$. (Side $b$ is too short to reach the base).\n*   **One right-angled triangle:** If $b = h$. (Side $b$ is exactly the length of the altitude).\n*   **Two distinct triangles:** If $h < b < a$. (Side $b$ is longer than the altitude but shorter than side $a$, allowing it to intersect the base at two different points).\n*   **One triangle:** If $b \\ge a$. (Side $b$ is long enough to intersect the base at only one valid point to form a triangle).\n\nOur goal is to find the condition for which there are exactly two possible triangles. This corresponds to the case:\n$h < b < a$\n\n**Step 5: Find the Range for the Length of AC**\n\nSubstituting the values we have for $h$ and $a$:\n$2.5 < b < 5$\n\nSo, for two possible triangles to exist, the length of side $AC$ (which is $b$) must be strictly greater than 2.5 and strictly less than 5.\n\n**Step 6: Count the Integer Values in the Determined Range**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of $AC$ that satisfy the condition. We need to find the integers that lie within the interval $(2.5, 5)$.\nThe integers that are greater than 2.5 and less than 5 are:\n*   3\n*   4\n\nLet's check the endpoints:\n*   If $AC = 2$, it's less than 2.5, so no triangle can be formed.\n*   If $AC = 5$, then $b=a$, which leads to one isosceles triangle.\n\nTherefore, the only integer values for $AC$ that result in two possible triangles are 3 and 4. The number of these integer values is 2."
