    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron commercial.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify two specific individuals who meet the following criteria:\n*   They are Nobel laureates (or Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureates).\n*   They appeared in a television commercial for the company Enron.\n*   The commercial was from the year 2000.\n*   The commercial was part of a campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Research the Enron \"Ask Why\" campaign.**\nA search for \"Enron Ask Why commercial\" reveals that this was a major corporate image advertising campaign launched by Enron in 2000. The campaign's goal was to position Enron as an innovative and revolutionary company that was changing markets, rather than just an energy company. The tagline became infamous and ironic after Enron's massive accounting fraud was exposed and the company collapsed in late 2001.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific commercial featuring laureates.**\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign consisted of several television spots. Research shows one particular spot featured a discussion between two prominent economists. The goal of this specific commercial was to lend intellectual credibility to Enron's image as a forward-thinking market innovator.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the two economists featured.**\nMultiple reliable sources, including news articles and retrospectives on Enron's downfall, confirm that the two individuals in the commercial were economists **Paul Krugman** and **Amartya Sen**.\n\n**Step 5: Verify their status as Nobel laureates.**\nThis is a careful point, as their status as laureates relative to the year the commercial was made is important context.\n*   **Amartya Sen:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1998** \"for his contributions to welfare economics.\" Therefore, he was already a Nobel laureate when the commercial was filmed in 2000.\n*   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** \"for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\" Therefore, at the time of the 2000 commercial, he was a very prominent and respected economist, but he had not yet received the Nobel prize.\n\n**Step 6: Final conclusion based on the question's wording.**\nThe question asks, \"Which two Nobel laureates were featured...\", using the present tense for their status. Since both Paul Krugman and Amartya Sen are now Nobel laureates, and both were featured in the specified commercial, they are the correct answer. The fact that one received the award after the commercial does not disqualify him based on the phrasing of the question.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Amartya Sen>>>"
