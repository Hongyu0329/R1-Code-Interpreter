    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the group structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group $Q_{128}$**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, is given by the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n}=1, x^n=y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nFor the group of size 128, we have $4n = 128$, so $n=32$. The group is $Q_{128}$.\nThe presentation is:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64}=1, x^{32}=y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nThe elements of $G$ can be divided into two types:\n1.  Elements of the form $x^k$ for $k=0, 1, \\ldots, 63$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n2.  Elements of the form $x^k y$ for $k=0, 1, \\ldots, 63$.\n\nLet's find the order of elements of the second type.\n$(x^k y)^2 = x^k y x^k y$. The relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$ implies $xy=yx^{-1}$, and more generally $x^k y = y x^{-k}$.\nSo, $(x^k y)^2 = x^k (y x^k) y = x^k (x^{-k} y) y = x^k x^{-k} y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\nSince $x^{32}$ has order 2 (as $(x^{32})^2 = x^{64}=1$), any element of the form $x^k y$ has order 4.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if there exists an integer $m$ such that $H$ is the subgroup generated by the $m$-th powers of all elements of $G$. This subgroup is denoted by $G^m = \\langle g^m \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n\nTo find all power subgroups of $Q_{128}$, we need to compute $G^m$ for various integers $m$ and count how many distinct subgroups we find.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate $G^m$ for $Q_{128}$**\n\nWe need to find the generators of $G^m$. These are the $m$-th powers of all elements in $G$.\nLet $g$ be an element of $G$.\n\n*   If $g = x^k$, then $g^m = (x^k)^m = x^{km}$.\n*   If $g = x^k y$, we need to compute $(x^k y)^m$.\n    *   If $m$ is even, let $m=2j$. Then $(x^k y)^m = ((x^k y)^2)^j = (x^{32})^j = x^{32j}$.\n    *   If $m$ is odd, let $m=2j+1$. Then $(x^k y)^m = ((x^k y)^2)^j (x^k y) = (x^{32})^j x^k y = x^{32j} x^k y$.\n\nNow, let's analyze $G^m = \\langle \\{ (x^k)^m \\mid \\forall k \\} \\cup \\{ (x^k y)^m \\mid \\forall k \\} \\rangle$. We'll consider two cases for $m$.\n\n**Case 1: $m$ is odd**\n\nIf $m$ is odd, then $\\gcd(m, \\text{ord}(x)) = \\gcd(m, 64) = 1$.\n*   The set of powers $\\{x^{km}\\}$ generates $\\langle x^m \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(m,64)} \\rangle = \\langle x^1 \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$. So, the entire cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is contained in $G^m$.\n*   For elements of the form $x^k y$, their $m$-th powers are $x^{32j} x^k y$ where $j=(m-1)/2$.\n    For $k=0$, the element $y^m = x^{32j}y$ is in $G^m$.\n    Since $\\langle x \\rangle \\subseteq G^m$, its element $(x^{32j})^{-1}$ is also in $G^m$.\n    Therefore, $y = (x^{32j})^{-1}(x^{32j}y)$ must be in $G^m$.\n*   Since $G^m$ contains both $x$ and $y$, it must contain the entire group they generate, which is $G = Q_{128}$.\n*   So, for any odd integer $m$, $G^m = G$. This gives us **one** power subgroup: the group $G$ itself.\n\n**Case 2: $m$ is even**\n\nIf $m$ is even, let $m=2j$.\n*   The powers of elements from $\\langle x \\rangle$ are $x^{km}$. These generate the subgroup $\\langle x^m \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(m, 64)} \\rangle$.\n*   The powers of elements of the form $x^k y$ are $(x^k y)^m = x^{32j} = x^{16m}$.\n*   So, $G^m = \\langle \\langle x^m \\rangle, x^{16m} \\rangle$.\n*   Since $x^{16m}$ is a power of $x^m$, it is already included in the subgroup $\\langle x^m \\rangle$. Thus, the second set of generators is redundant.\n*   Therefore, for an even integer $m$, $G^m = \\langle x^m \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(m, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nFrom Step 3, the power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ are:\n1.  The group $G=Q_{128}$ itself (when $m$ is odd).\n2.  Cyclic subgroups of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(m, 64)$ for some even integer $m$.\n\nLet's find all possible values for $d$. Since $m$ is even, we can write $m=2k$ for some integer $k$. Then $d = \\gcd(2k, 64)$. Any such $d$ must be a divisor of 64 and must be even, since it has a factor of 2. So, $d$ must be an even divisor of 64.\n\nConversely, let $d$ be any even divisor of 64. Can we find an even $m$ such that $d = \\gcd(m, 64)$? Yes, we can simply choose $m=d$. Since $d$ is an even divisor of 64, $m=d$ is even, and $\\gcd(d, 64) = d$.\n\nSo, the power subgroups arising from even values of $m$ are precisely the subgroups $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ for all even divisors $d$ of 64.\n\nThe divisors of $64 = 2^6$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\nThe even divisors of 64 are $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n\nThis gives us 6 distinct cyclic subgroups:\n*   $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (of order 32)\n*   $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (of order 16)\n*   $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (of order 8)\n*   $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (of order 4)\n*   $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (of order 2)\n*   $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, of order 1)\n\nThese 6 subgroups, along with the group $G=Q_{128}$ itself (from the case where $m$ is odd), form the complete set of power subgroups. These are all distinct.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 1 (from odd m) + 6 (from even m) = 7.\n\nFinal list of power subgroups:\n1.  $Q_{128}$\n2.  $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$\n3.  $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$\n4.  $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$\n5.  $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$\n6.  $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$\n7.  $\\{1\\}$\n\nThere are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
