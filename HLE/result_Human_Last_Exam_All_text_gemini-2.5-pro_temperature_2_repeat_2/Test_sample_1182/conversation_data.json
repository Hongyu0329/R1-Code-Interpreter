    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the curve and understand the goal**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation:\n$C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nWe need to find the number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction of this curve over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The integer coefficients allow us to view the curve as defined over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a better model for the curve**\n\nThe given equation might not be \"minimal\". The reduction of this equation modulo 2 gives $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$, which is $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This represents a double line in the special fiber over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Such a model is highly singular and not suitable for determining the stable reduction directly. We need to find a better model by a change of coordinates.\n\nA standard technique is to use a transformation of the form $x = 2^k X$ and $y = 2^m Y$.\n$ (2^m Y)^2 = 8(2^k X)^5 + 4(2^k X)^4 + 4(2^k X)^3 + (2^k X)^2 + 8(2^k X) $\n$ 2^{2m} Y^2 = 2^{5k+3} X^5 + 2^{4k+2} X^4 + 2^{3k+2} X^3 + 2^{2k} X^2 + 2^{k+3} X $\nWe want to make the new equation have integral coefficients (powers of 2 are non-negative) and be \"minimal\" in the sense that not all coefficients are divisible by 2. We divide the equation by $2^{2m}$:\n$ Y^2 = 2^{5k+3-2m} X^5 + 2^{4k+2-2m} X^4 + 2^{3k+2-2m} X^3 + 2^{2k-2m} X^2 + 2^{k+3-2m} X $\nLet's try to find integers $k, m$ that simplify the equation. The goal is to clear denominators without introducing a common factor of 2. Let's try to minimize the valuation of the discriminant, which generally corresponds to making $k$ negative.\n\nLet's try $k=-1$.\nThe exponents for the coefficients of $X^i$ are:\n$i=5: 5(-1)+3-2m = -2-2m$\n$i=4: 4(-1)+2-2m = -2-2m$\n$i=3: 3(-1)+2-2m = -1-2m$\n$i=2: 2(-1)-2m = -2-2m$\n$i=1: (-1)+3-2m = 2-2m$\nTo make the coefficients integral, all exponents must be $\\ge 0$.\nThe most restrictive condition is $-2-2m \\ge 0$, which implies $2m \\le -2$, so $m \\le -1$.\nLet's choose $m=-1$ to make the leading coefficient have the smallest possible valuation.\nThe exponents become:\n$i=5: -2-2(-1)=0$\n$i=4: -2-2(-1)=0$\n$i=3: -1-2(-1)=1$\n$i=2: -2-2(-1)=0$\n$i=1: 2-2(-1)=4$\n\nSo the new equation is:\n$Y^2 = 2^0 X^5 + 2^0 X^4 + 2^1 X^3 + 2^0 X^2 + 2^4 X$\n$C': Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$\nThis new model $C'$ is related to the original curve $C$ by the coordinate change $x = X/2$ and $y=Y/2$ (with $C$ defined by $y^2 = 8x+...$).\nThis model is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, and its coefficients are not all divisible by 2. This looks like a much better model to analyze.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the special fiber of the new model**\n\nThe special fiber $\\bar{C'}$ is the reduction of the model $C'$ modulo 2.\n$\\bar{C'}: Y^2 \\equiv X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X \\pmod{2}$\n$\\bar{C'}: Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + X^2$\nWe can factor the right-hand side:\n$\\bar{C'}: Y^2 = X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1)$\n\n**Step 4: Find the singularities of the special fiber**\n\nThe singular points of this plane curve are where the partial derivatives of the defining polynomial vanish. Let $F(X,Y) = Y^2 - X^5 - X^4 - X^2$.\n$\\partial F / \\partial Y = 2Y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n$\\partial F / \\partial X = -(5X^4 + 4X^3 + 2X) \\equiv -X^4 \\equiv X^4 \\pmod{2}$.\nFor a point to be singular, we must have $\\partial F / \\partial X = 0$, so $X^4 = 0$, which implies $X=0$.\nIf $X=0$, the curve's equation gives $Y^2 = 0$, so $Y=0$.\nThus, the only affine singular point of $\\bar{C'}$ is $(0,0)$.\n\nTo classify this singularity, we look at the lowest degree terms of the equation near $(0,0)$:\n$Y^2 = X^2$ (after ignoring higher order terms $X^5$ and $X^4$).\nThis can be written as $Y^2 - X^2 = 0$, or $(Y-X)(Y+X) = 0$.\nIn characteristic 2, this is $(Y-X)(Y-X) = (Y-X)^2=0$ or $(Y+X)^2=0$.\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2$, $Y+X=Y-X$, so we have two identical tangent directions. This indicates a cusp. Let me re-check this.\nThe tangent cone is defined by the lowest degree part of the equation $F(X,Y)=0$. The equation is $Y^2 - X^2 - X^4 - X^5 = 0$. The lowest degree part is $Y^2-X^2=0$. In $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this is $Y^2+X^2=(Y+X)^2=0$. This is a cusp.\n\nLet's re-examine. A node has distinct tangent directions. $Y-X=0$ and $Y+X=0$. Over a field of characteristic not 2, these are distinct. Over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, they are identical ($1=-1$). This implies the singularity is not an ordinary double point (node) but a cusp.\n\nA curve with a cusp is not a stable curve. A stable curve can only have nodes as singularities. To get to the stable reduction, one must resolve the cusp. The resolution of a cusp typically results in a chain of projective lines.\n\nLet's check the point at infinity. The degree of the affine equation is $d=5$. To study the point at infinity, we homogenize and dehomogenize appropriately. Or use the change of coordinates $X=1/U, Y=V/U^3$.\n$(V/U^3)^2 = (1/U)^5 + (1/U)^4 + 2(1/U)^3 + (1/U)^2 + 16(1/U)$\n$V^2/U^6 = (1+U+2U^2+U^3+16U^4)/U^5$\n$V^2 = U(1+U+2U^2+U^3+16U^4)$\nModulo 2, this is $V^2 = U(1+U+U^3) = U+U^2+U^4$. The point at infinity from the $X,Y$ plane corresponds to $U=0$, which gives $V=0$. The equation near $(U,V)=(0,0)$ is $V^2-U-U^2-U^4=0$. The partial derivative w.r.t $U$ is $-1-2U-4U^3 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 2$. Since this is non-zero, the point at infinity is smooth.\n\nSo, the special fiber $\\bar{C'}$ is an irreducible curve with a single cusp at the origin.\nThe geometric genus of $\\bar{C'}$ is $g_g = 1$, as it is birational to the elliptic curve $u^2 = X^3+X^2+1$ (where $u=Y/X$).\nThe arithmetic genus of $\\bar{C'}$ is $g_a = 2$, which is the genus of the generic fiber of $C'$.\nThe relation $g_a = g_g + \\delta$ holds, where $\\delta$ measures the \"singularity degree\". For a single cusp, $\\delta=1$. $2 = 1+1$. This is consistent.\n\n**Step 5: From the singular fiber to the stable fiber**\n\nThe special fiber $\\bar{C'}$ of our model $C'$ is not stable because it has a cusp. The stable reduction is obtained by resolving the singularities of a regular model, and then contracting any rational components (copies of $\\mathbb{P}^1$) with fewer than 3 intersection points with other components.\n\nThe process of resolving a cusp on a special fiber of an arithmetic surface typically replaces the cusp with one or more rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$). The precise configuration depends on the nature of the singularity of the model $C'$ itself. In this specific context (type $I_n^*$ reduction in elliptic curve theory, which this resembles), a cusp often resolves to a chain of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ components.\n\nHowever, the question is how many nodes the *final stable* reduction has. There is a general principle that the stable reduction of a genus 2 curve is one of a few types. It cannot be the cuspidal curve. It could be a union of an elliptic curve and a rational curve intersecting at one point (a node). Or it could be a union of two elliptic curves meeting at a point. It could also be an irreducible nodal curve of genus 1. Or a tree of rational curves.\n\nGiven the initial analysis which yields a curve with one singularity (a cusp) that needs to be \"replaced\" by a stable configuration, it's very likely that this unstable singularity corresponds to a single node in the stable reduction. The underlying irreducible component of geometric genus 1 is typically preserved. The cusp point \"blossoms\" into a configuration which might itself have nodes, but in many common scenarios, after contracting unstable components, it results in the main component becoming nodal.\n\nA common situation is that a cuspidal fiber component resolves into a main component (the strict transform, here of genus 1) and a \"degenerate\" part, which in the stable model simplifies and attaches to the main component at a single point, thus forming a node.\nSo, the irreducible cuspidal curve is replaced by a component of the stable reduction which is the normalization of the original one (an elliptic curve), and it intersects other components (if any) in nodes.\n\nLet's assume the simplest possible outcome: the stable reduction consists of a single irreducible component. For this to be stable, its singularities must be nodes. It would be a genus 1 curve with one node. The number of double points would be 1.\n\nAlternatively, the stable model may consist of two components: the strict transform of our special fiber (which is a smooth genus 1 curve) and a rational curve coming from resolving the cusp. If these meet at one point, the stable model has two components and one double point. The number of double points is again 1.\n\nBoth plausible scenarios lead to one double point. Let's confirm this logic. The single cusp on the intermediate special fiber indicates one \"point of degeneracy\". In the final stable graph, this degeneracy is resolved into nodes. The number of vanishing cycles (which equals the number of nodes for bad reduction of this type) should be 1, corresponding to the drop in genus from 2 to 1 on the main component. So the number of double points is $g - g' = 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\nSo, we expect the stable reduction to have exactly one double point."
