    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n### Core Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`. These positions form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack together.\n\n1.  **Heptad Repeat and Framing**: The first crucial step is to correctly identify the heptad repeat frame. We must find a frame that places hydrophobic residues (like I, L, V, A, M, W) at the core 'a' and 'd' positions. We will test different possible frames for each sequence.\n2.  **Harbury's Rules**: Seminal work by Harbury et al. established key rules by mutating the 'a' and 'd' positions of the GCN4 coiled-coil:\n    *   **Dimer (2-mer)**: Favored by `a=L, d=L` or `a=L, d=I`. Also favored by having a bulky residue at one core position and a small one at the other (e.g., `a=I, d=A`).\n    *   **Trimer (3-mer)**: Strongly favored by having Isoleucine (I) at both `a` and `d` positions (`a=I, d=I`). Also, polar residues like Threonine (T) or Asparagine (N) at a core position can stabilize a trimer through a central, hydrogen-bonded network.\n    *   **Tetramer (4-mer)**: Strongly favored by `a=I, d=L`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence\n\nWe will look for a consistent framing for these related sequences. A promising frame is `gabcdef` (starting at the second residue of the sequence), which places the Isoleucine (I) at position 'a'.\n\n**1. Sequence: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Framing**: Let's test the `gabcdef` frame (starting at residue 'I').\n    *   Sequence: `E | I A Q A L K E | I A K A L K E | I A W A L K E | I A Q A L K`\n    *   Heptad: `g | a b c d e f g | a b c d e f g | a b c d e f g | a b c d e f`\n*   **Core Positions**:\n    *   `a` positions (I, I, I, I)\n    *   `d` positions (A, A, W, A) - Alanine (A) and Tryptophan (W) are hydrophobic.\n*   **Analysis**: The core is defined by `a=I` and `d=A`. A bulky, β-branched residue (I) at the 'a' position paired with a small residue (A) at the 'd' position leads to efficient packing in a **dimer**.\n*   **Predicted State**: 2 (Dimer)\n\n**2. Sequence: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Framing**: Another plausible frame for this type of sequence is `xxabcdef` (starting at residue 3). Let's test this as the sequence pattern appears to be based on `A...L`.\n    *   Sequence: `EI | A A L K Q E I | A A L K K E N | A A L K Q E I | A A L K Q`\n    *   Heptad: `xx | a b c d e f g | a b c d e f g'| a b c d e f g | a b c d`\n*   **Core Positions**:\n    *   `a` positions (A, A, A, A)\n    *   `d` positions (L, L, L, L)\n*   **Analysis**: The core is defined by `a=A` and `d=L`. Alanine behaves similarly to Leucine (L). The `a=L, d=L` pattern is a classic signature for a **dimer**. The irregular part of the sequence (`KENAALK`) maintains the `a=A, d=L` core motif.\n*   **Predicted State**: 2 (Dimer)\n\n**3. Sequence: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Framing**: Let's use the `gabcdef` frame that starts with `a=I`, which seems consistent with the other sequences.\n    *   Sequence: `E | I A A I K Q E | I A A I K K E | I A A I K W E | I A A I K Q`\n*   **Core Positions**:\n    *   `a` positions (I, I, I, I)\n    *   `d` positions (I, I, I, I)\n*   **Analysis**: The core is defined by `a=I, d=I`. According to Harbury's rules, this pattern strongly favors a **trimer**. However, very dense packing of Isoleucine can also promote the formation of **tetramers**, which offer a different packing geometry. Given the multiple-choice options, a tetramer is a very plausible state for such a core. The bulky, non-polar `W` in an 'e' position may also favor a more open tetrameric structure over a tight trimer.\n*   **Predicted State**: 4 (Tetramer)\n\n**4. Sequence: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Framing**: This sequence lacks a repeating hydrophobic pair. However, it features a repeating Leucine (L) and Glutamine (Q). Let's test a frame where the hydrophobic L is at a core `d` position. This would be a `defgabc` frame starting at `L(6)`.\n    *   Sequence: `EIQKQ | L K E I Q K Q | L K E I Q W Q | L K E I Q K Q | L K`\n    *   Heptad: `defga | b c d e f g a | b c d e f g a | b c d e f g a | b`\n*   **Core Positions**:\n    *   `a` positions (Q, Q, Q, Q) - Glutamine\n    *   `d` positions (L, L, L, L) - Leucine\n*   **Analysis**: The core is `a=Q` and `d=L`. A core containing polar glutamine residues can be stabilized by forming inter-helical hydrogen bonds (an \"amide zipper\" or \"Q-zipper\"). This motif, paired with Leucine at the 'd' positions, has been shown to form stable **dimers**.\n*   **Predicted State**: 2 (Dimer)\n\n**5. Sequence: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Framing**: This sequence is a variation of Sequence 1. We will use the same `gabcdef` frame.\n    *   Sequence: `E | I A Q T L K E | I A K T L K E | I A W T L K E | I A Q T L K`\n*   **Core Positions**:\n    *   `a` positions (I, I, I, I)\n    *   `d` positions (T, T, T, T) - Threonine\n*   **Analysis**: The core is `a=I` and `d=T`. Isoleucine at the 'a' position promotes higher-order states (trimer or tetramer). Threonine is a polar, β-branched amino acid. When placed in the core, the polar `-OH` groups of multiple threonines can point inwards to form a stabilizing, hydrogen-bonded network. This structural feature is characteristic of **trimers**.\n*   **Predicted State**: 3 (Trimer)\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the analyses for each sequence, we get the following oligomeric states:\n*   Sequence 1: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 3: **4** (Tetramer)\n*   Sequence 4: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 5: **3** (Trimer)\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of numbers **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
