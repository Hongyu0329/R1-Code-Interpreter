    "This is a problem in plane topology. Let the two closed connected subsets of the unit square `S` be `A` and `B`, such that `A \\cup B = S`. We want to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection `A \\cap B`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the setup:**\n    *   The space is the unit square `S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]`. `S` is compact and connected.\n    *   We have two subsets, `A` and `B`.\n    *   `A` and `B` are both closed.\n    *   `A` and `B` are both connected.\n    *   The union `A \\cup B = S`.\n    *   The intersection `A \\cap B` is also a closed set (as the intersection of two closed sets). Since `A` and `B` are subsets of the compact set `S`, they are also compact. Therefore `A` and `B` are *continua* (compact connected sets).\n\n2.  **Initial thoughts using Algebraic Topology (Mayer-Vietoris Sequence):**\n    A common tool for problems involving unions of spaces is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. For a decomposition `X = A \\cup B`, it relates the homology groups of `X`, `A`, `B`, and `A \\cap B`. A part of the sequence is:\n    `... → H₁(X) → H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) → H₀(X) → 0`\n\n    *   `H₀(Z)` measures the number of path-connected components of a space `Z`. For \"well-behaved\" spaces, this is the same as the number of connected components.\n    *   Let's assume for a moment that our sets are \"well-behaved\" (path-connected).\n    *   `X = S` (the unit square) is path-connected, so `H₀(S) = ℤ`.\n    *   `A` and `B` are given as connected. If we assume they are path-connected, `H₀(A) = ℤ` and `H₀(B) = ℤ`. So `H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) = ℤ²`.\n    *   `S` is simply connected (it's contractible), so `H₁(S) = 0`.\n    *   Let `k` be the number of path-components of `A \\cap B`. Then `H₀(A ∩ B) = ℤᵏ`.\n\n    Plugging this into the sequence:\n    `... → 0 → ℤᵏ → ℤ² → ℤ → 0`\n\n    For this sequence to be exact, the map `β: ℤᵏ → ℤ²` must be injective (because the preceding map from `H₁(S) = 0` is the zero map, so its image is trivial, and `Im(previous) = Ker(β)`). A map from `ℤᵏ` to `ℤ²` can only be injective if `k ≤ 2`. Further analysis of the maps in the sequence shows that it maps any generator of `ℤᵏ` to the element `(1, 1)` in `ℤ²`. Such a map is only injective if `k=1`. This argument suggests the answer is 1.\n\n3.  **Flaws in the Simple Argument:**\n    There are two main issues with the above reasoning:\n    *   **Applicability of Mayer-Vietoris:** The standard version of the sequence for singular homology requires that the interiors of `A` and `B` cover the space `S` (i.e., `Int(A) ∪ Int(B) = S`). This is not guaranteed by the problem statement. For example, if `A` is the left half-rectangle and `B` is the right half-rectangle, their interiors do not cover the dividing line.\n    *   **Connected vs. Path-Connected:** For general closed subsets of the plane, being connected does not imply being path-connected. The `H₀` group in singular homology counts path components, which might be different from the number of connected components asked for in the question.\n\n4.  **Construction-Based Approach:**\n    Let's try to construct examples.\n    *   **N=1:** `A = [0, 0.5] × [0, 1]` and `B = [0.5, 1] × [0, 1]`. The intersection is the line segment `{0.5} × [0, 1]`, which is connected. So 1 component is possible.\n    *   **Can we achieve N > 1?** To have multiple components in `A ∩ B`, `A` and `B` must \"touch\" in several disconnected places. However, both `A` and `B` must remain connected. This requires creating paths within `A` that connect its parts of the intersection, and similarly for `B`. These paths must not merge the components of the intersection.\n\n5.  **Advanced Results in Plane Topology:**\n    This problem is related to classic results in topology.\n    *   It is a known theorem that for **any positive integer `N`**, it is possible to construct two continua `A` and `B` in the plane such that their union is the unit square `S` and their intersection `A ∩ B` has exactly `N` connected components.\n    *   These constructions are typically non-trivial and are generalizations of the \"Lakes of Wada\" construction, which involves creating regions with a shared, complex boundary. For `N > 1`, these sets are somewhat pathological and not simple geometric shapes.\n    *   Furthermore, a theorem by Kuratowski states that for any two continua `A, B` in the 2-sphere `S²` (or the plane/disk), the intersection `A ∩ B` must have a **finite** number of connected components.\n\n6.  **Synthesizing the Conclusion:**\n    *   From the constructive results, we know that any positive integer `N` is a possible number of components for the intersection. The set of possible component counts is `{1, 2, 3, 4, ...}`.\n    *   From Kuratowski's theorem, we know this number cannot be infinite.\n    *   The question asks for the \"largest number\" of components. Since the set of possible numbers is the set of all positive integers, there is no single largest integer in this set.\n    *   In such a context, the question \"What is the largest number?\" is standardly interpreted as asking for the supremum (least upper bound) of the set of possible values. Since the set `{1, 2, 3, ...}` is unbounded above, its supremum is infinity.\n\nTherefore, while for any specific pair of sets `A` and `B` the number of components of their intersection must be a finite integer, this integer can be made arbitrarily large. There is no finite upper bound on the number of components.\n\nFinal Answer is therefore infinity.\n\n>>> \\infty"
