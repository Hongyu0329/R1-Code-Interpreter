    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the location of Waskaganish:** Waskaganish is a Cree community located in northern Quebec, Canada. It is situated on the south-eastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 51.19° N latitude, 78.76° W longitude. For the purpose of this question, \"Waskaganish gathering place\" will be treated as the community of Waskaganish itself.\n\n2.  **Identify potential neighboring provinces and territories:** We need to find the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, *excluding Quebec*. The Canadian provinces and territories that are geographically nearest to this part of Quebec are:\n    *   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario lies to the west of Quebec. The provincial border runs along the western side of James Bay.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, such as Akimiski Island, Charlton Island, and the Twin Islands.\n    *   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** This province borders Quebec to the east, but the border is hundreds of kilometers away from Waskaganish.\n    *   **New Brunswick:** This province borders Quebec far to the south, hundreds of kilometers away.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the proximity of each candidate:**\n    *   **Newfoundland and Labrador & New Brunswick:** These can be immediately ruled out due to the large distance from Waskaganish.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The closest parts of Nunavut to Waskaganish are the islands in James Bay. The nearest significant islands are Charlton Island and the much larger Akimiski Island. These islands are located north and northwest of Waskaganish, out in the bay. The straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the nearest point on these islands is over 100 kilometers.\n    *   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario shares a land border with Quebec that runs south from James Bay. Waskaganish (Quebec) is located on the southern shore of James Bay. The western portion of James Bay's southern shore belongs to Ontario. Therefore, to get from Waskaganish to Ontario, one only needs to travel west along the coastline of the bay. The provincial border where Quebec ends and Ontario begins is less than 100 kilometers away from Waskaganish by a straight line.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the distances on a map, the landmass of the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the islands that constitute the nearest part of the territory of Nunavut.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to know that the islands within James Bay belong to Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario.\n*   One must consider the land borders, not just the general direction. Waskaganish is on the coast, and the coastline continues west into the neighboring province of Ontario.\n*   The \"closest\" refers to the shortest straight-line distance (as the crow flies) to the border of the next province or territory. The land of Ontario is geographically closer than the land of Nunavut.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
