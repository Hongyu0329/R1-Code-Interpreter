    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry group of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Decode the SMILES String and Visualize the Molecule**\n\nThe SMILES string is `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`.\n\n*   The `C#C` parts represent ethynyl groups (-C≡CH). There are three of them.\n*   The complex central part `c1cc2...c67` represents a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). This core structure is known as Dibenzo[cd,mn]pyrene, more commonly called triangulene.\n*   The ethynyl groups `(C#C)` are attached to specific positions on this core. Visualizing the structure (or using a molecule builder) reveals that the three ethynyl groups are attached at the three \"corner\" or \"point\" positions of the triangular-shaped triangulene core.\n*   The triangulene core is planar. The ethynyl groups (-C≡CH) are linear. The bonds connecting the ethynyl groups to the planar core will lie within that plane, meaning the entire molecule is planar.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Symmetry of the Unsubstituted Core (Triangulene)**\n\n*   The triangulene core has the shape of an equilateral triangle.\n*   It has a principal C₃ axis of rotation perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through its center.\n*   It has three C₂ axes of rotation that lie within the plane of the molecule. Each C₂ axis passes through a corner carbon and the midpoint of the opposite side.\n*   Since the molecule is planar, it possesses a horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   A point group with a Cn axis, n perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) is a Dnh group. Since n=3, the point group of the triangulene core is D₃h.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Effect of the Substituents on the Symmetry**\n\nWe need to check if the three ethynyl groups preserve or break the symmetry elements of the D₃h core.\n\n*   **Planarity (σh):** As established in Step 1, the entire molecule is planar. Therefore, the horizontal mirror plane (σh) is preserved.\n*   **Principal Axis (C₃):** The three ethynyl substituents are identical. They are located at the three corner positions, which are equivalent by a 120° rotation. A C₃ rotation maps each ethynyl group onto an identical ethynyl group. Therefore, the C₃ axis is preserved.\n*   **Perpendicular Axes (C₂):** Consider one of the C₂ axes that passes through a corner. This axis runs through one of the substituted carbon atoms and the entire linear ethynyl group attached to it. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves that substituent unchanged. This rotation also swaps the other two identical corner substituents. Thus, the molecule is unchanged by this operation. This logic applies to all three C₂ axes. Therefore, all three C₂ axes are preserved.\n*   **Vertical Mirror Planes (σv):** A D₃h group also has three vertical mirror planes (σv). Each σv plane contains the C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes. It passes through one corner substituent and bisects the angle between the other two. Reflection in this plane leaves the substituent in the plane unchanged and exchanges the other two identical substituents. The molecule remains unchanged. Thus, the three σv planes are also preserved.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axis (S₃):** Since both the C₃ axis and the σh plane are preserved, the S₃ improper rotation axis (C₃ rotation followed by reflection in σh) is also preserved.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe substitution of three identical, linear ethynyl groups at the three equivalent corner positions of the D₃h triangulene core does not break any of its symmetry elements. The resulting molecule retains all the symmetry operations of the D₃h group (E, 2C₃, 3C₂, σh, 2S₃, 3σv).\n\nTherefore, the point group of the molecule is D₃h.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
