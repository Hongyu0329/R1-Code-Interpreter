Based on its role in promoting a more potent, persistent, and less-differentiated memory T cell phenotype, IL-15 would be predicted to lead to an **increase** in the release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) by CAR T cells upon target antigen stimulation, compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This reflects their enhanced functional capacity.
