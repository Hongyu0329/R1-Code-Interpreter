The laboratory's mistake was relying on a Quality Control test that was not robust enough. The test used vegetative cells of *Bacillus subtilis*, which were inhibited by the partially degraded chloramphenicol in Batch 3. This misleadingly "passed" the batch, while in reality, the antibiotic had been weakened by autoclaving to the point where it could not inhibit the more resilient airborne bacterial spores that contaminated the media later.
