    "The problem asks for the conditions under which three functions, F, G, and H, with specified domains and codomains, have a so-called \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". This is a question about the existence of a solution to a system of fixed-point-like equations. The answer involves stating a set of sufficient conditions based on fixed-point theory, typically the Banach Contraction Principle applied to a product space.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\"\n\nFirst, we must formally define what an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is, based on the function signatures provided:\n*   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n*   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n\nA point `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` is an **FGH-tripled fixed point** if it simultaneously satisfies the following three equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Careful Point:** Note the specific arrangement of variables in the arguments of `G` and `H`, which differs from the standard `(x, y, z)` permutation. This must be handled correctly in the analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate Conditions for Existence using a Fixed-Point Theorem\n\nThe existence of such a point can be guaranteed by applying a fixed-point theorem. The Banach Contraction Principle is the most common tool for this type of problem. This theorem requires the functions to operate on a complete metric space and to be a \"contraction mapping.\"\n\nWe can combine F, G, and H into a single operator `T` on the product space `M = X * Y * Z`. The problem then becomes finding a fixed point for `T`.\n\nThe conditions can be summarized in the following existence and uniqueness theorem.\n\n---\n\n### **Theorem: Existence and Uniqueness of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nA unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is guaranteed to exist if the following conditions on the spaces `X, Y, Z` and the functions `F, G, H` are met.\n\n#### **Condition 1: Properties of the Spaces**\n\nThe sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **non-empty complete metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Completeness is a crucial property. It means that any sequence of points that are getting progressively closer together (a Cauchy sequence) will converge to a limit that is also inside the space. This ensures the iterative process used to find the fixed point has a place to converge to. Examples of complete metric spaces include `ℝ^n`, `ℂ^n`, or any closed subset of these.\n\n#### **Condition 2: Contraction-like Properties of the Functions**\n\nThe functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must be Lipschitz continuous with specific constraints on their Lipschitz constants. This means there must exist non-negative constants (`a_1, a_2, a_3`, `b_1, b_2`, `c_1, c_2, c_3`) such that the following inequalities hold for all `x_1, x_2 ∈ X`, `y_1, y_2 ∈ Y`, and `z_1, z_2 ∈ Z`:\n\n1.  **For F:** The change in `F` is bounded by a linear combination of the changes in its inputs.\n    `d_X( F(x_1, y_1, z_1), F(x_2, y_2, z_2) ) ≤ a_1 * d_X(x_1, x_2) + a_2 * d_Y(y_1, y_2) + a_3 * d_Z(z_1, z_2)`\n\n2.  **For G:** The change in `G` is bounded by the changes in its inputs `(y, x, y)`.\n    `d_Y( G(y_1, x_1, y_1), G(y_2, x_2, y_2) ) ≤ b_1 * d_X(x_1, x_2) + b_2 * d_Y(y_1, y_2)`\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since `y` appears twice in the input `(y, x, y)`, its contribution might be represented differently, but the form above is general enough. `b_2` captures the total dependence on the metric `d_Y`.\n\n3.  **For H:** The change in `H` is bounded by the changes in its inputs `(z, y, x)`.\n    `d_Z( H(z_1, y_1, x_1), H(z_2, y_2, x_2) ) ≤ c_1 * d_X(x_1, x_2) + c_2 * d_Y(y_1, y_2) + c_3 * d_Z(z_1, z_2)`\n\n#### **Condition 3: Combined Contraction Condition**\n\nFor the overall operator `T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x))` to be a contraction on the product space `X * Y * Z` (equipped with the sum metric), the sum of the corresponding Lipschitz constants must be less than 1.\nLet:\n*   `K_x = a_1 + b_1 + c_1` (sum of coefficients for `d_X`)\n*   `K_y = a_2 + b_2 + c_2` (sum of coefficients for `d_Y`)\n*   `K_z = a_3 + c_3`      (sum of coefficients for `d_Z`)\n\nThe final condition is that the maximum of these sums must be strictly less than 1:\n`max(K_x, K_y, K_z) < 1`\n\n**Careful Point:** This inequality ensures that the combined operator `T` shrinks distances between points. Repeated application of `T` will generate a Cauchy sequence which, by the completeness of the space, converges to a unique point `(x, y, z)`. This point is the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n---\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nIn essence, the conditions are:\n1.  **Topological Condition:** The spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Analytical Condition:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` behave like \"contractions\" in a way that, when combined, their aggregate effect shrinks distances in the product space `X * Y * Z`. This is formalized by the inequality `max( a_1 + b_1 + c_1,  a_2 + b_2 + c_2,  a_3 + c_3 ) < 1`.\n\nUnder these conditions, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) for functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z is a solution to the system of equations F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.\nSufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are given by a theorem based on the Banach Contraction Principle:\n\n1.  **Space Requirement:** The sets X, Y, and Z are non-empty complete metric spaces with metrics d_X, d_Y, and d_Z, respectively.\n\n2.  **Function Requirement (Lipschitz/Contraction Conditions):** There exist non-negative constants a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, and c_1, c_2, c_3 such that for all points x_1, x_2 ∈ X, y_1, y_2 ∈ Y, and z_1, z_2 ∈ Z, the following inequalities hold:\n    a)  `d_X( F(x_1, y_1, z_1), F(x_2, y_2, z_2) ) ≤ a_1*d_X(x_1, x_2) + a_2*d_Y(y_1, y_2) + a_3*d_Z(z_1, z_2)`\n    b)  `d_Y( G(y_1, x_1, y_1), G(y_2, x_2, y_2) ) ≤ b_1*d_X(x_1, x_2) + b_2*d_Y(y_1, y_2)`\n    c)  `d_Z( H(z_1, y_1, x_1), H(z_2, y_2, x_2) ) ≤ c_1*d_X(x_1, x_2) + c_2*d_Y(y_1, y_2) + c_3*d_Z(z_1, z_2)`\n\n3.  **Overall Contraction Condition:** The sums of the constants corresponding to each metric must be controlled. Let `K_x = a_1 + b_1 + c_1`, `K_y = a_2 + b_2 + c_2`, and `K_z = a_3 + c_3`. The combined condition is:\n    `max(K_x, K_y, K_z) < 1`\n\nIf these three conditions are satisfied, then there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point in X*Y*Z.>>>"
