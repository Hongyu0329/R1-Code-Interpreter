### **Summary of Appropriate Management**

**1. Procedures:**
*   **Phase I (Emergency):**
    *   Immediate medical consultation and intervention to control her uncontrolled diabetes.
    *   Systemic administration of antibiotics and a tetanus booster.
    *   Radiographic assessment of the entire jaw.
    *   Gentle debridement and irrigation of the wound sockets, followed by suturing of any soft tissue lacerations. Replantation of teeth is not an option due to the 28-hour time delay.
    *   Pain management.
*   **Phase II (Definitive Treatment, post-stabilization):**
    *   Confirm glycemic control is achieved before proceeding.
    *   The most appropriate treatment is a **Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**, given the systemic health risks (diabetes), the challenging skeletal pattern (SNB 88Â°, Class III), and the conservative nature of this option compared to a high-risk bridge or implants.

**2. Cells of Interest:**
The primary cells of interest are those central to wound healing, all of which are negatively affected by uncontrolled diabetes:
*   **Neutrophils and Macrophages:** Impaired function increases infection risk.
*   **Fibroblasts:** Reduced function delays soft tissue healing.
*   **Osteoblasts:** Reduced function impairs bone healing in the sockets.

**3. Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Denture Type:** Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD).
*   **Material:** Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy framework, with acrylic resin base and acrylic teeth.
*   **Abutment Teeth:** The primary abutments are the **left central incisor and left second premolar**. To ensure stability, the design must include **cross-arch stabilization** by engaging additional teeth, such as the **left first molar and teeth on the right side of the arch** (e.g., right canine and premolar).
*   **Reasoning for Abutment Choice:** To provide essential support (via rests), retention (via clasps), and stability against the challenging biting
