    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we must list all the elements that are classified as noble gases. In order of increasing atomic number, they are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\nOganesson (Og) is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth. Therefore, it is excluded from consideration for this question. We will focus on the first six.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of \"All Terrestrial Matter\"**\n\"Terrestrial matter\" refers to all the material that makes up the planet Earth, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere (oceans, water), and lithosphere (crust, mantle, core). The vast majority of the noble gases on Earth are found in the atmosphere, as they are chemically inert and gaseous at standard temperatures and pressures. While some noble gases are produced within the Earth's crust through radioactive decay (like Helium and Argon), their primary reservoir for measurement and comparison is the atmosphere. The relative rarity in the atmosphere is an excellent proxy for their overall rarity on the planet.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas in the Atmosphere**\nThe standard composition of dry air in the Earth's atmosphere is the key dataset. The concentrations (by volume) are as follows:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** Approximately 0.934% or 9,340 parts per million (ppm). It is the third most abundant gas in the atmosphere overall.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** Approximately 0.001818% or 18.18 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** Approximately 0.000524% or 5.24 ppm. Although it is the second most abundant element in the universe, much of Earth's primordial helium escaped into space due to its low mass.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Approximately 0.000114% or 1.14 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Approximately 0.0000087% or 0.087 ppm (87 parts per billion).\n\nBased on these stable gases, Xenon is the rarest. However, we must also consider Radon.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is unique among the naturally occurring noble gases because it is radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only about 3.8 days.\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation. It is continuously generated as a decay product in the decay chains of uranium and thorium, which are found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's crust.\n*   **Abundance:** Because it decays so quickly, Radon does not accumulate in the atmosphere to significant levels. Its concentration is extremely low and highly variable depending on location (e.g., higher near the ground over granite-rich soil). A typical average atmospheric concentration is on the order of 6 x 10⁻¹⁸ percent.\n*   **Comparison:** Comparing Xenon's abundance (8.7 x 10⁻⁶ %) to Radon's abundance (6 x 10⁻¹⁸ %), Radon is vastly rarer. Its concentration is about one-trillionth that of Xenon.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the \"2002\" Time Constraint**\nThe question specifies the year 2002. For the stable noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), their atmospheric concentrations have been effectively constant over human history. For Radon, its concentration at any given moment is determined by the balance between its production from radioactive decay in the crust and its own rapid decay. This balance has not changed in any significant way, so the data and rarity rankings from today are perfectly applicable to the year 2002.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy comparing the abundances of all naturally occurring noble gases on Earth, we can establish a clear order of rarity. While Xenon is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases, the radioactive nature and extremely short half-life of Radon mean that it is present in far smaller quantities at any given time.\n\n**Ranking from Most Abundant to Rarest:**\n1.  Argon (Ar)\n2.  Neon (Ne)\n3.  Helium (He)\n4.  Krypton (Kr)\n5.  Xenon (Xe)\n6.  **Radon (Rn)**\n\nTherefore, Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
