    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for a specific year when the individual \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly adopted or identified with the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Individuals:**\n    *   **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan:** He is a well-known Nigerian politician who served as the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015. His full birth name is widely documented as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n    *   **Azikiwe:** This name is most famously associated with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, a leading figure in Nigeria's independence movement and the first President of Nigeria (from 1963 to 1966).\n\n3.  **Verify the Name:** The core of the question is whether Goodluck Jonathan's name includes \"Azikiwe\". A check of all official records, biographical information, and public statements reveals the following:\n    *   His full name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n    *   \"Ebele\" is his middle name.\n    *   \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his recognized name, either by birth or by any official change.\n\n4.  **Investigate for Name Changes or Public Identification:** The next step is to search for any instance where Goodluck Jonathan might have publicly taken on the name \"Azikiwe\", even if not legally. This could be through a speech, a public declaration, or a chieftaincy title.\n    *   A thorough review of news archives, official government publications, and reputable biographical sources from his time as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President, and President shows no record of him ever adding \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identifying himself as such.\n    *   While politicians may reference historical figures like Nnamdi Azikiwe in speeches to draw parallels or inspiration, this is not the same as adopting their name. There is no evidence that Jonathan ever went beyond referencing him.\n\n5.  **Address the Premise of the Question:** The question operates on the premise that Goodluck Jonathan did, at some point, identify himself as \"Azikiwe\". Based on all available evidence, this premise is incorrect. He has never used the name \"Azikiwe\" as part of his own.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinct Identities:** It is crucial not to confuse Goodluck Ebele Jonathan with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. They are two separate, distinct, and prominent figures in Nigerian history.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** In this case, the complete lack of any credible report, official document, or public record of such an event is strong evidence that it never occurred. A name change or adoption by a head of state would have been a major, widely reported news item.\n*   **Misinformation:** The question may stem from misinformation, a rumor, or a simple confusion between the two political figures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the event described in the question never happened. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" or added that name to his own. Therefore, there is no year to provide.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe or adding the name to his own. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The question is based on a false premise."
