    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Piece and Section**\nThe piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to find the score and look at the part for the first violin (Violino I) at the very end of the final movement (IV. Allegro con fuoco).\n\n**Step 2: Examine the Final Measures of the First Violin Part**\nLooking at a standard orchestral score, we focus on the last two bars played by the first violins.\n\n*   **Penultimate Measure:** The first violins play a fast, virtuosic upward run. The very last notes played within this measure are part of an ascending sixteenth-note triplet. These notes are a very high G (often written as G6) and a very high A (A6).\n*   **Final Measure:** In the last bar of the symphony, the first violin section plays a single, sustained whole note with a fermata (a pause).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Three Notes in Sequence**\nCombining the end of the run with the final note, the last three sequential notes written for the first violin are:\n1.  G6 (the second-to-last note in the penultimate measure)\n2.  A6 (the very last note in the penultimate measure)\n3.  Bb4 (the single note in the final measure)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Pitch of the Final Note**\nThe note in the final measure is written on the third line of the treble clef. The symphony is in B-flat major, and its key signature contains two flats (B♭ and E♭). Therefore, the note on the third line is a B-flat. Its specific octave is the one just above middle C, also known as Bb4.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Pitches to Find the Lowest Note**\nNow we compare the three notes we identified:\n*   **G6:** A very high-pitched G.\n*   **A6:** A very high-pitched A, a whole step higher than G6.\n*   **Bb4:** A B-flat in the middle of the musical range, significantly lower than the other two notes.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy comparing the pitches, it is clear that Bb4 is much lower than both G6 and A6. Therefore, the lowest of the last three notes the first violin plays is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
