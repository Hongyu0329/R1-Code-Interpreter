    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. (A subcontinuum is a subspace that is also a continuum).\n    *   **Hereditarily Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is the most famous example of such a space.\n    *   **Metric:** The space has a metric defined on it, which induces the topology. This implies the space is separable (has a countable dense subset).\n    *   **$X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** This is the space $X$ with a single point removed. Since $X$ is a compact metric space, $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, non-compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Stone-Cech Compactification $\\beta(Y)$:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$ (which $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is), its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta(Y)$ is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n    *   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The remainder is the set of points added to $Y$ to form its compactification, i.e., $\\beta(Y) \\setminus Y$. In our case, this is $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n    *   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The composants partition the space.\n\n2.  **Characterize the Remainder:**\n    The central part of the problem is to understand the topological nature of the Stone-Cech remainder, $R$. A celebrated theorem by the mathematician David P. Bellamy provides the answer.\n    *   **Bellamy's Theorem (1971):** If $X$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum, then for any point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is also a hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n\n    This theorem is profound. It tells us that the remainder isn't just a collection of points; it's a highly structured object with the same fundamental property of hereditary indecomposability as the original space. It's important to note that even if $X$ is metric, the remainder $R$ is not necessarily metric. In fact, Bellamy used this result to construct the first known example of a non-metric hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Composants:**\n    Now the question is reduced to: How many composants does a hereditarily indecomposable continuum have? This question applies to the remainder $R$. The number of composants depends on whether the continuum is degenerate (a single point) or non-degenerate (more than one point).\n    *   **Case 1: The continuum is degenerate.** If $R$ were a single point, it would trivially be a continuum. A single-point space has only one composant: the space itself. So the number of composants would be 1.\n    *   **Case 2: The continuum is non-degenerate.** For any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum (hereditary or not), it is a classical result in continuum theory, proved by S. Mazurkiewicz in the 1920s, that the number of composants is $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$). Each composant is a dense but meager ($F_{\\sigma}$) subset, and the Baire Category Theorem is used to show there must be uncountably many of them. Further analysis shows the cardinality is exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum Possible Number:**\n    The question asks for the *maximum possible* number of composants. This means we must consider if both the degenerate and non-degenerate cases for the remainder $R$ are possible.\n    *   From Bellamy's work, we know that there are choices of $X$ and $x$ for which the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate continuum. As mentioned, his construction of a non-metric hereditarily indecomposable continuum is an example. A non-metric space cannot be a single point.\n    *   Therefore, the number of composants can be $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   If there were some other choice of $X$ or $x$ for which the remainder $R$ turned out to be a single point, the number of composants would be 1.\n    *   The possible values for the number of composants are thus in the set $\\{1, 2^{\\aleph_0}\\}$. The maximum of these is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe problem is solved by applying two key theorems from continuum theory. Bellamy's theorem establishes that the Stone-Cech remainder is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum. Mazurkiewicz's theorem gives the number of composants for such a continuum. As there are known cases where this remainder is non-degenerate, the number of its composants is $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This is the maximum possible value."
