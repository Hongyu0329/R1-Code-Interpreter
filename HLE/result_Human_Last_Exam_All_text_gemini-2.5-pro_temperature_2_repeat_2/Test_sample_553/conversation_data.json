    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology**\n\n*   **\"The Beatles\"**: The search is limited to the discography of The Beatles.\n*   **\"starts with\"**: The chord progression must occur at the very beginning of the song, likely as the intro.\n*   **\"chord jump\"**: This implies a direct and often rhythmically clear transition between two chords, not just a slow or arpeggiated change.\n*   **\"tonic\"**: This is the first chord of the key, also known as the \"home\" chord. It can be major (I) or minor (i).\n*   **\"minor fifth chord\"**: This refers to a minor chord built on the fifth note of the scale. This is commonly abbreviated as \"v\" in Roman numeral analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Chord Progression**\n\nBased on the terms above, we are looking for a song that starts with one of two possible progressions:\n1.  **I → v**: A major tonic chord followed by a minor chord on the fifth degree. For example, in the key of A major, this would be an **A major** chord followed by an **E minor** chord.\n2.  **i → v**: A minor tonic chord followed by a minor chord on the fifth degree. For example, in the key of A minor, this would be an **A minor** chord followed by an **E minor** chord.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nLet's examine the introductions of famous Beatles songs to find a match.\n\n*   **\"And I Love Her\"**: The main verse progression is C# minor to G# minor. The key of the song is C# minor. The C# minor chord is the tonic (i), and the G# minor chord is the minor fifth (v). This fits the **i → v** pattern. However, the song does not *start* with this chord jump; it begins with an iconic single-note guitar riff before any chords are strummed.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\"**: The song begins with the vocals \"Ah, look at all...\" over a C major chord, which then moves to an E minor chord (\"...the lonely people\"). The song is in the key of E minor. Here, the progression is from a C major chord (the bVI chord) to the E minor tonic chord (i). This is a VI → i progression, not what we are looking for.\n*   **\"I'll Be Back\"**: This song, from the album *A Hard Day's Night*, begins immediately with a stark, strummed chord progression on acoustic guitars.\n    *   The song is in the key of A major. The tonic (I) chord is **A major**.\n    *   The fifth note of the A major scale is E. A minor chord built on E is **E minor** (v).\n    *   The song's instrumental introduction consists of a repeated \"jump\" from the A major chord to the E minor chord.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nWhile other songs may contain a similar progression, \"I'll Be Back\" is the one that most precisely fits the question. It **starts** immediately with a very distinct **\"chord jump from the tonic (A major) to the minor fifth chord (E minor)\"**. This I → v progression is the defining feature of the song's opening.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
