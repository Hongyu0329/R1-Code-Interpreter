    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concept of the question.\nThe question asks about the evolutionary fate of genes after a duplication event. Gene duplication creates an extra copy of a gene. Initially, this situation is redundant, as one copy is usually sufficient to perform the original function. The new copy is therefore free from the strong purifying selection that acts on the original gene. The question specifically asks for the mechanism that leads to the *retention* (keeping both copies) and *divergence* (the two copies evolving to be different) of these duplicate genes.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the most common fate of duplicate genes.\nThe most common outcome for a duplicate gene is that it accumulates deleterious mutations (like nonsense mutations, insertions, or deletions that cause frameshifts) because there is no selection pressure to maintain its function. Over time, it becomes a non-functional gene relic known as a **pseudogene**. This process is called **pseudogenization** or **nonfunctionalization**. This leads to the loss of the duplicate gene's function, which is contrary to the \"retention\" part of the question.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each answer choice in the context of gene retention and divergence.\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. Gene conversion acts to *homogenize* gene copies, which is the opposite of divergence. Therefore, it is not the mechanism responsible for the divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** As explained in Step 2, this is the process by which a duplicate gene becomes non-functional. It is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not the *retention* of two functional, diverged genes. So, this is an incorrect answer.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This is a model where one copy of the duplicate gene retains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. Because this new function is advantageous, natural selection acts to preserve this second copy. This model clearly explains both **retention** (due to the benefit of the new function) and **divergence** (the sequence must change to acquire the new function). This is a plausible mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene originally had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple tissues or at different developmental times (i.e., it was pleiotropic). After duplication, both copies accumulate different degenerative mutations that inactivate different *subsets* of the original functions. For example, copy 1 might lose function A but retain function B, while copy 2 retains function A but loses function B. Consequently, both copies become necessary to perform the complete range of ancestral functions. This process ensures the **retention** of both copies and leads to their **divergence**, as they specialize in their partitioned roles (often in their regulatory elements, but also potentially in their coding sequences).\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species that fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that facilitates such large-scale evolution, adaptive radiation is a species-level phenomenon, not a molecular mechanism that governs the fate of individual genes within a genome.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the most plausible mechanisms (Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization).\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the mechanism that is **\"most likely\"**.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** requires a rare beneficial, gain-of-function mutation to occur in the redundant gene copy *before* it is silenced by much more common loss-of-function mutations. This makes it a relatively rare event.\n*   **Subfunctionalization**, on the other hand, is driven by the partitioning of existing functions. This process relies on relatively common degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations occurring in different functional domains or regulatory regions of the two gene copies. Because many genes have complex functions and regulatory patterns, and because degenerative mutations are far more common than beneficial ones, the conditions for subfunctionalization are thought to arise more frequently. It provides a passive route to preservation, \"rescuing\" duplicate genes from the high probability of pseudogenization.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion.\nBecause subfunctionalization provides a more common and passive pathway for preserving duplicate genes by simply partitioning existing functions—a process that doesn't depend on rare beneficial mutations—many evolutionary biologists consider it to be a more frequent, and thus \"more likely,\" mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicated genes in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
