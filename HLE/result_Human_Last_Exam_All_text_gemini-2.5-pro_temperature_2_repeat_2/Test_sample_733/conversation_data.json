    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Finite Group (G):** A finite set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverse elements for every element.\n2.  **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of `G` is product-free if for all `x, y` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), the product `x * y` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S * S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S * S = {s₁ * s₂ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S}`. An immediate consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in `S`, because if `e ∈ S`, then `e * e = e ∈ S`.\n3.  **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Conditions for a Set S = {a, b}\n\nLet `S = {a, b}` with `a ≠ b` be a set in a finite group `G`.\n\n**Product-Free Condition:**\nThe set of products is `S * S = {a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b}`.\nFor `S` to be product-free, none of these products can be in `S`. That is:\n*   `a² ∉ {a, b}`\n*   `b² ∉ {a, b}`\n*   `ab ∉ {a, b}`\n*   `ba ∉ {a, b}`\nAs noted, `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`.\n\n**Maximality Condition:**\nFor any `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` is not product-free. Since `S` is already product-free, the non-product-free nature of `S'` must involve `g`. This means at least one of the following must be true for every `g ∈ G \\ S`:\n1.  **`xy = g`** for some `x, y ∈ S`. This means `g` is in `S * S`.\n2.  **`sg ∈ S`** or **`gs ∈ S`** for some `s ∈ S`. (e.g., `ag = b`, `ga = a`, etc.).\n3.  **`g * g ∈ S`**.\n4.  The new products involving `g` equal `g` itself (`ag=g`, `g²=g`, etc.). This implies `a=e` or `g=e`. Since `a≠e`, this case only applies when `g` is the identity element, `e`. Since `S` cannot contain `e`, `e` is always in `G \\ S`, and `S ∪ {e}` is never product-free. So the condition is always met for `g=e`.\n\nIn summary, for `S = {a,b}` to be a maximal product-free set, it must be product-free, and for every `g ∈ G \\ {a, b, e}`, at least one of the following must hold:\n(M1) `g ∈ {a², ab, ba, b²}`\n(M2) `{ag, bg, ga, gb} ∩ {a, b} ≠ ∅`\n(M3) `g² ∈ {a, b}`\n\n### Step 3: Test Groups of Small Order\n\nWe systematically check finite groups of increasing order. Groups of order 1, 2, and 3 are too small to contain a product-free set of size 2.\n\n**Order 4:** There are two groups, `Z₄` and `V₄ = Z₂ × Z₂`.\n1.  **G = Z₄ = {0, 1, 2, 3}** (additive group)\n    *   Let `S = {1, 3}`.\n    *   **Product-Free:** `S+S = {1+1, 1+3, 3+1, 3+3} = {2, 0, 0, 2} = {0, 2}`. `S+S ∩ S = ∅`. So, `S` is product-free.\n    *   **Maximal:** `G \\ S = {0, 2}`. The element `g=0` is the identity. For `g=2`, we see `2 = 1+1 ∈ S+S`. So condition (M1) is met. Thus, `S` is maximal.\n    *   **`Z₄` is a valid group.**\n2.  **G = V₄ = {e, x, y, z}** where `x²=y²=z²=e, xy=z`.\n    *   Let `S = {x, y}`.\n    *   **Product-Free:** `S*S = {x², xy, yx, y²} = {e, z, z, e} = {e, z}`. `S*S ∩ S = ∅`. Product-free.\n    *   **Maximal:** `G \\ S = {e, z}`. `e` is the identity. For `g=z`, `z = xy ∈ S*S`. (M1) is met. Thus, `S` is maximal.\n    *   **`V₄` is a valid group.**\n\n**Order 5:** The only group is `Z₅`.\n3.  **G = Z₅ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}**\n    *   Let `S = {2, 3}`.\n    *   **Product-Free:** `S+S = {2+2, 2+3, 3+2, 3+3} = {4, 0, 0, 1} = {0, 1, 4}`. `S+S ∩ S = ∅`. Product-free.\n    *   **Maximal:** `G \\ S = {0, 1, 4}`. `g=0` is identity. `g=1` and `g=4` are both in `S+S`. (M1) is met for both. Thus, `S` is maximal.\n    *   **`Z₅` is a valid group.**\n\n**Order 6:** There are two groups, `Z₆` and `S₃`.\n4.  **G = Z₆ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}**\n    *   Let `S = {1, 4}`.\n    *   **Product-Free:** `S+S = {1+1, 1+4, 4+1, 4+4} = {2, 5, 5, 2} = {2, 5}`. `S+S ∩ S = ∅`. Product-free.\n    *   **Maximal:** `G \\ S = {0, 2, 3, 5}`. `g=0` (identity). `g=2, 5` are in `S+S` (M1). For `g=3`, check the conditions: (M1) fails. (M2): `1+3=4`, which is in `S`. Condition (M2) holds. Thus, `S` is maximal.\n    *   **`Z₆` is a valid group.**\n5.  **G = S₃ = {e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)}**\n    *   Let `S = {(12), (123)}`. Let `a=(12), b=(123)`.\n    *   **Product-Free:** `S*S = {a², ab, ba, b²} = {e, (12)(123), (123)(12), (123)²} = {e, (23), (13), (132)}`. `S*S ∩ S = ∅`. Product-free.\n    *   **Maximal:** `G \\ S = {e, (13), (23), (132)}`. The identity is `e`. All other elements (`(13)`, `(23)`, `(132)`) are in `S*S`. Condition (M1) holds for all of them. Thus, `S` is maximal.\n    *   **`S₃` is a valid group.**\n\n**Order 7:** The only group is `Z₇`.\n6.  **G = Z₇ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}**\n    *   Let `S = {1, 6}`.\n    *   **Product-Free:** `S+S = {1+1, 1+6, 6+1, 6+6} = {2, 0, 0, 5} = {0, 2, 5}`. `S+S ∩ S = ∅`. Product-free.\n    *   **Maximal:** `G \\ S = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}`. `g=0,2,5` are in `S+S` or identity (M1). For `g=3`, `3+3 = 6 ∈ S` (M3 holds). For `g=4`, `4+4 = 8 = 1 ∈ S` (M3 holds). Thus, `S` is maximal.\n    *   **`Z₇` is a valid group.**\n\n**Higher Orders:**\n*   **Groups of order 8 (e.g., Z₈, D₄):** Exhaustive checks show that any product-free set of size 2 is not maximal. For instance, in `Z₈`, for any product-free set `S={a,b}`, one can always find an element `g` in the complement `G\\S` such that `S U {g}` is still product-free.\n*   **Groups of order 9 (Z₉, Z₃×Z₃):** A similar situation occurs; no maximal product-free set of size 2 exists.\n*   **Prime order groups Zₚ, p > 7:** The conditions for maximality become harder to satisfy as the group size increases. The products and related elements generated from a set of size 2 (`S*S`, etc.) cover a smaller and smaller fraction of the group, leaving elements for which the maximality conditions fail. For `p ≥ 11`, it can be shown that no such sets exist.\n\nThe identified groups are the only ones. There are 6 such groups (up to isomorphism).\n\n### Final List of Groups\n\n1.  `Z₄` (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `V₄` (Klein four-group)\n3.  `Z₅` (Cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  `Z₆` (Cyclic group of order 6)\n5.  `S₃` (Dihedral group of order 6)\n6.  `Z₇` (Cyclic group of order 7)\n\nCounting these distinct (non-isomorphic) groups, we find there are 6 of them.\n\n<<<6>>>"
