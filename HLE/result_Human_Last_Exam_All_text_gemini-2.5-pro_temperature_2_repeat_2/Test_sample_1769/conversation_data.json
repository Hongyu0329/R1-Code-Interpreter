    "This is an excellent question that delves into the fascinating and complex history of the English language. To determine what the word for \"sister\" might be without Norse influence, we need to trace the evolution of the original Old English word.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Old English and Old Norse Words**\n\n*   The word we use today, \"sister,\" comes from Middle English *sister*.\n*   However, before the Viking invasions, the Anglo-Saxons had their own native word for the concept: **sweostor** (pronounced roughly \"sweh-oh-stor\").\n*   The Norse invaders brought their word for sister, which was **systir**.\n*   It's crucial to note that both *sweostor* and *systir* are cognates, meaning they descend from the same ancient Proto-Germanic root, *\\*swestēr*. They are linguistic cousins.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Linguistic Interaction**\n\n*   When the Norse settled in large parts of England (the Danelaw), Old English and Old Norse were spoken side-by-side. The languages were similar enough for speakers to understand each other but different enough for cross-influence.\n*   In many cases where both languages had a word for the same concept, one of three things happened:\n    1.  The English word won out (e.g., man).\n    2.  The Norse word replaced the English one (e.g., *take* replaced *niman*).\n    3.  The Norse form **influenced and altered** the English one. This is what happened with \"sister.\"\n*   The native Old English *sweostor* simplified to **suster** during the Middle English period. This was the natural, homegrown evolution of the word.\n*   Simultaneously, the Old Norse *systir* entered Middle English as **sister**.\n*   The two forms, *suster* and *sister*, competed. Because the Scandinavian form was dominant in the influential North and East of England, *sister* (with the \"i\" sound from Norse) eventually became the standard form across the entire country, displacing the native *suster*.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Hypothetical Evolution Without Norse Influence**\n\nTo answer the question, we must ignore the existence of the Norse word *systir* and follow the path of the native word *sweostor*.\n\n*   **Old English:** *sweostor*\n*   **Middle English:** As documented in texts from Southern England (which had less Norse influence), this form naturally evolved into **suster**.\n*   **Modern English:** We now need to project how *suster* would have evolved from Middle English to today. We can do this by looking at what happened to other words with a short \"u\" vowel sound (/ʊ/).\n    *   Middle English *cumen* -> Modern English *come* (/kʌm/)\n    *   Middle English *sunne* -> Modern English *sun* (/sʌn/)\n    *   Middle English *lufian* -> Modern English *love* (/lʌv/)\n\n    The short \"u\" sound in Middle English regularly became the /ʌ/ sound in Modern English, which we call the \"STRUT\" vowel (the vowel sound in words like *cup*, *luck*, and *duster*).\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Final Form**\n\n*   Applying this consistent phonological rule, the Middle English word *suster* (pronounced \"soos-ter\") would have evolved into a word pronounced \"suh-ster\".\n*   The most logical spelling for this word in Modern English, following patterns like *duster*, *buster*, and *custom*, would be **suster**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Not a complete replacement:** The word \"sister\" isn't a case of the English language *lacking* a word and borrowing one. It's a case of a borrowed Scandinavian *form* of a word replacing the native English *form* of the same word.\n2.  **Regional Variation:** The native form *suster* did not vanish overnight. It survived for centuries in various English dialects, particularly in the South and West, but eventually lost out to the Scandinavian-influenced form in standard usage.\n3.  **Phonological Predictability:** While linguistic evolution isn't perfectly mathematical, the sound change from Middle English short \"u\" to Modern English /ʌ/ is one of the most regular and predictable shifts in the language's history, making this a highly confident projection.\n\nTherefore, if the Norse had never interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the native word *sweostor* would have continued its natural evolution.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
