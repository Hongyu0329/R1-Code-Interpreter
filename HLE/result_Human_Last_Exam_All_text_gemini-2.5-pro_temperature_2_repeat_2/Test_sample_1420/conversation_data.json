    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Specific Heat Exponent ($\\alpha$):** This exponent describes how the singular part of the specific heat ($C_{sing}$) behaves near the critical temperature ($T_c$). The relationship is given by $C_{sing} \\sim |T - T_c|^{-\\alpha}$. A positive $\\alpha$ indicates a divergence in the specific heat at the critical point.\n*   **Renormalization Group (RG) and $\\epsilon$-Expansion:** The RG is a powerful theoretical tool for studying critical phenomena. The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a key calculational technique within RG. It involves performing calculations in a dimension $d = d_c - \\epsilon$, where $d_c$ is the upper critical dimension and $\\epsilon$ is treated as a small parameter. The result for any critical exponent is obtained as a power series in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**2. Identify the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**\n\n*   For a wide range of systems described by a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\\phi^4$ theory (which includes the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n*   Above this dimension ($d > 4$), fluctuations are not strong enough to alter the predictions of mean-field theory, and the critical exponents take their classical, mean-field values. Below this dimension ($d < 4$), fluctuations become dominant and RG methods like the $\\epsilon$-expansion are needed.\n\n**3. Define the Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$)**\n\n*   The $\\epsilon$-expansion is performed by setting $d = d_c - \\epsilon$.\n*   The problem specifies a spatial dimension of $d=3$.\n*   Therefore, the expansion parameter $\\epsilon$ is:\n    $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n*   Although $\\epsilon=1$ is not a small parameter, the hope is that the series expansion will still provide a reasonable first approximation, which often turns out to be the case.\n\n**4. Recall the $\\epsilon$-Expansion Formula for $\\alpha$**\n\n*   The critical exponents depend on the symmetry of the order parameter, which is characterized by the number of its components, 'n'. The Ising model has n=1, the XY model has n=2, and the Heisenberg model has n=3.\n*   The general result for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to the first order in $\\epsilon$ for the n-component vector model is:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4 - n}{2(n + 8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**5. Specify the Model and Universality Class**\n\n*   The question refers to \"a system\" in $d=3$ without specifying the symmetry (the value of 'n'). In such contexts, the default and most fundamental case is the **Ising universality class**, which corresponds to systems with an order parameter having a single component ($n=1$). This class describes phenomena like the liquid-gas transition or a simple uniaxial magnet.\n*   We will proceed assuming the Ising universality class ($n=1$).\n\n**6. Calculate the Value of $\\alpha$**\n\n*   First, substitute $n=1$ into the general formula for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4 - 1}{2(1 + 8)}\\epsilon = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon$\n*   Now, substitute the value of our expansion parameter, $\\epsilon = 1$, into this expression:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Universality:** The final value of the exponent depends on the universality class (i.e., the value of 'n'). We assumed the most common case of n=1 (Ising model). If another model like the XY (n=2) or Heisenberg (n=3) model were intended, the result would be different.\n*   **Approximation:** The result is obtained from a first-order expansion in $\\epsilon$. Using $\\epsilon=1$ is an extrapolation, not a perturbation. The accuracy is therefore limited. The accepted modern value for the 3D Ising model is $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$, whereas our calculation gives $\\alpha = 1/6 \\approx 0.167$. The goal here is to find the value *from the first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion*, not the exact known value.\n*   **Connection to Hyperscaling:** The result can be verified using the hyperscaling relation $2-\\alpha = \\nu d$, where $\\nu$ is the correlation length exponent. To first order, $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon$. Plugging in $d=4-\\epsilon$ and solving for $\\alpha$ to order $\\epsilon$ gives the same result, providing a good consistency check.\n\nBased on the standard application of the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the Ising universality class in $d=3$:\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
