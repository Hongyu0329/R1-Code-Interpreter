    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the new sequence\nLet the new 8-point sequence be denoted by $y(n)$. It is formed by interleaving the 4-point sequences $x(n)$ and $h(n)$.\n$y(n) = \\{x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)\\}$\n\nThis can be expressed mathematically as:\n*   $y(2m) = x(m)$ for $m = 0, 1, 2, 3$\n*   $y(2m+1) = h(m)$ for $m = 0, 1, 2, 3$\n\n### Step 2: Relate the 8-point DFT of y(n) to the 4-point DFTs of x(n) and h(n)\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT of $y(n)$, which we will call $Y(k)$. The definition of the N-point DFT is:\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y(n) W_N^{nk}$, where $W_N = e^{-j2\\pi/N}$.\n\nFor our case, N=8, so:\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) W_8^{nk}$\n\nWe can split the summation into even and odd indices of n:\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) W_8^{(2m)k} + \\sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) W_8^{(2m+1)k}$\n\nNow, substitute $y(2m) = x(m)$ and $y(2m+1) = h(m)$:\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) W_8^{2mk} + \\sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) W_8^{(2m+1)k}$\n\nWe simplify the twiddle factors:\n*   $W_8^{2mk} = (e^{-j2\\pi/8})^{2mk} = e^{-j2\\pi mk / 4} = W_4^{mk}$\n*   $W_8^{(2m+1)k} = W_8^{2mk} \\cdot W_8^k = W_4^{mk} \\cdot W_8^k$\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $Y(k)$:\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) W_4^{mk} + W_8^k \\sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) W_4^{mk}$\n\nThe summations are the definitions of the 4-point DFTs of $x(n)$ and $h(n)$, which are given as $X(k)$ and $H(k)$. Note that $X(k)$ and $H(k)$ are periodic with period 4. The formula becomes:\n$Y(k) = X(k \\pmod 4) + W_8^k H(k \\pmod 4)$\n\nThis relationship is the basis of the radix-2 decimation-in-time FFT algorithm synthesis step. We can find the first four points ($k=0,1,2,3$) and the last four points ($k=4,5,6,7$) using this formula.\n\nFor $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$:\n$Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k H(k)$\n\nFor $k = 4, 5, 6, 7$, let $k=k'+4$ where $k'=0,1,2,3$:\n$Y(k'+4) = X((k'+4) \\pmod 4) + W_8^{k'+4} H((k'+4) \\pmod 4)$\nUsing $X(k'+4) = X(k')$, $H(k'+4)=H(k')$, and $W_8^{k'+4} = W_8^{k'}W_8^4 = W_8^{k'}(-1) = -W_8^{k'}$.\n$Y(k'+4) = X(k') - W_8^{k'} H(k')$\n\nSo, for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$:\n1.  $Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k H(k)$\n2.  $Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k H(k)$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Twiddle Factors $W_8^k$\n$W_8 = e^{-j2\\pi/8} = e^{-j\\pi/4} = \\cos(\\pi/4) - j\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n*   $W_8^0 = 1$\n*   $W_8^1 = \\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n*   $W_8^2 = (e^{-j\\pi/4})^2 = e^{-j\\pi/2} = -j$\n*   $W_8^3 = W_8^1 \\cdot W_8^2 = (\\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}})(-j) = \\frac{-j+j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the values of Y(k)\nWe are given:\n*   $X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]$\n*   $H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]$\n\n**For k = 0:**\n*   $Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1$\n*   $Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1$\n\n**For k = 1:**\n*   Term: $W_8^1 H(1) = (\\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}})(1+j) = \\frac{1 - j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1+1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$\n*   $Y(1) = X(1) + \\sqrt{2} = j + \\sqrt{2}$\n*   $Y(5) = X(1) - \\sqrt{2} = j - \\sqrt{2}$\n\n**For k = 2:**\n*   Term: $W_8^2 H(2) = (-j)(1) = -j$\n*   $Y(2) = X(2) + (-j) = -1 - j$\n*   $Y(6) = X(2) - (-j) = -1 + j$\n\n**For k = 3:**\n*   Term: $W_8^3 H(3) = (\\frac{-1-j}{\\sqrt{2}})(1-j) = \\frac{-(1+j)(1-j)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-(1-j^2)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-(1+1)}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}$\n*   $Y(3) = X(3) + (-\\sqrt{2}) = -j - \\sqrt{2}$\n*   $Y(7) = X(3) - (-\\sqrt{2}) = -j + \\sqrt{2}$\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the final DFT sequence Y(k)\nCombining the calculated values, we get the 8-point DFT sequence $Y(k)$.\n$Y(0) = 1$\n$Y(1) = \\sqrt{2} + j$\n$Y(2) = -1 - j$\n$Y(3) = -\\sqrt{2} - j$\n$Y(4) = 1$\n$Y(5) = -\\sqrt{2} + j$\n$Y(6) = -1 + j$\n$Y(7) = \\sqrt{2} - j$\n\nThe final 8-point DFT is $[1, \\sqrt{2}+j, -1-j, -\\sqrt{2}-j, 1, -\\sqrt{2}+j, -1+j, \\sqrt{2}-j]$.\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
