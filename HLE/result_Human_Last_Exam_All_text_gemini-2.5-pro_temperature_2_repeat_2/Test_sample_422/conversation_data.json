    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Prompt**\n\nFirst, we must understand the core components and constraints of the question:\n*   **Core Theory:** The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge. This states that a subject S knows a proposition P if and only if:\n    1.  P is true.\n    2.  S believes that P.\n    3.  S is justified in believing that P.\n*   **Key Constraint 1:** We must assume there are only two possible epistemic states for an individual: **Knowledge** and **Belief**. Any mental state concerning a proposition must fall into one of these two categories.\n*   **Key Constraint 2:** We must **ignore Gettier problems**. Gettier problems are specific counterexamples where a person has a justified true belief that isn't knowledge because the justification is flawed or only accidentally leads to a true belief. We need to find other, more fundamental problems with the JTB model under the given constraints.\n*   **Objective:** Identify two distinct problems that the JTB definition encounters due to these constraints.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Justification\" Condition**\n\nLet's examine the third pillar of JTB: Justification. For a belief in a proposition (P) to be justified, it must be supported by other reasons, evidence, or propositions (let's call them Q, R, S...).\n\n*   **Question:** What is the epistemic status of these supporting propositions (Q, R, S...)?\n*   **Applying the Constraint:** According to the problem's rules, the epistemic status of Q, R, S... can only be **Knowledge** or **Belief**. This leads to a dilemma.\n\n    *   **Option A: Justification is based on mere 'Beliefs'.** If the justification for P rests on other beliefs (Q, R...), then what justifies Q and R? They must be justified by yet another set of beliefs. This creates an endless chain of justifications, none of which is ever firmly grounded. This is the **Problem of Infinite Regress**. The justification is never complete, so knowledge can never be firmly established.\n\n    *   **Option B: Justification is based on 'Knowledge'.** To avoid infinite regress, one might claim that the justifying propositions (Q, R, S...) must be *known*. However, this makes the definition of knowledge circular. We are defining knowledge of P by stating it must be based on *knowledge* of Q, R, etc. We are using the term \"knowledge\" to define itself. This is the **Problem of Circularity**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 1:** The justification condition, when constrained to only the states of Knowledge or Belief, forces the JTB theory into a logical trap: either an infinite regress of justification (if based on belief) or a circular definition (if based on knowledge).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Relationship Between the \"Justification\" and \"True\" Conditions**\n\nNow let's analyze how the 'Justification' condition relates to the 'True' condition. Does being justified guarantee that the belief is true? This presents another dilemma.\n\n*   **Question:** Must a valid justification be infallible (i.e., guarantee the truth of the belief)?\n\n    *   **Option A: Justification is fallible (it does not guarantee truth).** This is the common-sense view. We can be well-justified in believing something that turns out to be false (e.g., \"The sun revolves around the Earth\" was once a justified belief). If justification is fallible, then a person can have a Justified False Belief. From the believer's internal perspective, a Justified True Belief (Knowledge) and a Justified False Belief are indistinguishable. They feel identical. This means that whether a justified belief counts as \"Knowledge\" depends entirely on an external factor (the actual truth of the proposition) that the agent has no direct epistemic access to. Knowledge becomes a matter of \"epistemic luck\" rather than a distinct cognitive achievement.\n\n    *   **Option B: Justification must be infallible (it must guarantee truth).** To solve the problem of luck, one might argue that for a belief to be justified *enough* for knowledge, the justification must logically guarantee its truth. If this is the case, then any \"justified belief\" is automatically a \"true belief\". This makes the **'True' condition in the JTB definition redundant**. If a belief is infallibly justified, we already know it is true, so adding \"and it must be true\" is superfluous. The definition effectively becomes \"Knowledge is an Infallibly Justified Belief,\" which sets an impossibly high standard that excludes most of what we ordinarily consider knowledge.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 2:** The relationship between justification and truth creates a dilemma for JTB. Either justification is fallible, making knowledge indistinguishable from the agent's perspective from a \"lucky\" belief, or justification must be infallible, which makes the \"truth\" condition of JTB redundant and sets a standard for knowledge that is practically impossible to meet.\n\n---\n<<<The two problems for the JTB theory of knowledge under the given constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Dilemma of the Regress of Justification:** The 'Justified' condition requires a belief to be supported by other propositions. According to the constraint that epistemic states are only 'Knowledge' or 'Belief', this leads to a critical dilemma:\n    *   If the supporting propositions are merely 'Beliefs', then the justification never terminates, leading to an **infinite regress** where no belief is ever truly grounded.\n    *   If the supporting propositions must be 'Knowledge', then the definition becomes **circular**, as it uses the concept of knowledge to define knowledge itself.\n\n2.  **The Dilemma of Infallible Justification:** This problem concerns the relationship between the 'Justified' and 'True' conditions.\n    *   If justification is **fallible** (does not guarantee truth), then an agent cannot internally distinguish between a Justified True Belief (Knowledge) and a Justified False Belief. This makes the acquisition of knowledge a matter of external luck rather than a distinct epistemic state from the agent's perspective.\n    *   If justification must be **infallible** (guarantees truth) to avoid the luck problem, then the 'True' condition in JTB becomes **redundant**. An infallibly justified belief is by definition true, rendering the \"T\" in JTB unnecessary and setting an impossibly high standard for what can be known.>>>"
