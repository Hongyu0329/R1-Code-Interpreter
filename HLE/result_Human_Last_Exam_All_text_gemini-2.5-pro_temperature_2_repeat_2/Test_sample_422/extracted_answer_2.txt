The two problems for the JTB theory of knowledge under the given constraints are:

1.  **The Dilemma of the Regress of Justification:** The 'Justified' condition requires a belief to be supported by other propositions. According to the constraint that epistemic states are only 'Knowledge' or 'Belief', this leads to a critical dilemma:
    *   If the supporting propositions are merely 'Beliefs', then the justification never terminates, leading to an **infinite regress** where no belief is ever truly grounded.
    *   If the supporting propositions must be 'Knowledge', then the definition becomes **circular**, as it uses the concept of knowledge to define knowledge itself.

2.  **The Dilemma of Infallible Justification:** This problem concerns the relationship between the 'Justified' and 'True' conditions.
    *   If justification is **fallible** (does not guarantee truth), then an agent cannot internally distinguish between a Justified True Belief (Knowledge) and a Justified False Belief. This makes the acquisition of knowledge a matter of external luck rather than a distinct epistemic state from the agent's perspective.
    *   If justification must be **infallible** (guarantees truth) to avoid the luck problem, then the 'True' condition in JTB becomes **redundant**. An infallibly justified belief is by definition true, rendering the "T" in JTB unnecessary and setting an impossibly high standard for what can be known.
