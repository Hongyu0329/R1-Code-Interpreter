    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks for the English surname of an English poet. This surname is said to appear in a Russian translation of an essay, specifically within a description of Vienna's wide boulevards.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the core puzzle**\nThe puzzle hinges on a connection between a Russian phrase describing wide boulevards and the name of an English poet. This strongly suggests a wordplay or a phonetic pun that works in the Russian language.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Vienna's wide boulevards\" clue**\nVienna is famous for its Ringstrasse (\"Ring Road\"), a series of very wide boulevards. When comparing their width to other streets, a natural question or statement would involve the concept of \"wider.\"\n\n**Step 4: Explore the Russian language connection**\n*   The Russian adjective for \"wide\" is \"широкий\" (shirokiy).\n*   The comparative form, meaning \"wider,\" is \"шире\" (shire), pronounced roughly like \"shee-reh.\"\n*   In Russian, to form a yes-no question, the particle \"ли\" (li) is often added after the word being questioned.\n*   So, a phrase asking \"Are [the boulevards] wider?\" could be constructed as \"...шире ли?\" (...shire li?).\n\n**Step 5: Find the phonetic pun**\nThe Russian phrase \"шире ли\" (shire li), when spoken, sounds almost identical to the way a Russian speaker would pronounce the surname of the English poet **Shelley**. The name is transliterated into Russian as \"Шелли\" and pronounced very similarly to \"shee-reh-lee.\"\n\n**Step 6: Connect to an English poet**\nThe surname Shelley belongs to Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822), one of the major English Romantic poets. This perfectly matches the clue of \"an English poet.\"\n\n**Step 7: Synthesize the solution**\nA Russian author or translator describing Vienna's boulevards could write a sentence like, \"А венские бульвары, быть может, **шире ли** всех прочих?\" which means, \"And are the Viennese boulevards, perhaps, **wider than** all the others?\" Within this grammatically correct Russian sentence, the words \"шире ли\" create a hidden phonetic reference to the poet \"Shelley.\"\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The puzzle relies entirely on cross-language phonetics (Russian and English).\n*   You must identify the correct Russian word for \"wider\" (шире) and the interrogative particle (ли).\n*   The \"certain essay\" might be a hypothetical context for the pun, as this is a well-known Russian literary brain-teaser, rather than a direct quote from a single, famous source.\n*   The question asks for the surname *in English*.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe surname of the English poet that phonetically appears in the Russian description of Vienna's boulevards is Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
