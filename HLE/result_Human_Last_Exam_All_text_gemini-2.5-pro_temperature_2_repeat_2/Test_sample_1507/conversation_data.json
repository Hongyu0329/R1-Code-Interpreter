    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the geometric object:** The question asks about the **great icosahedron**. The great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 large, intersecting triangular faces. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n\n2.  **Understand the term \"outer-hull\":** The \"outer-hull\" refers to the **convex hull** of the object. The convex hull of a set of points (like the vertices of a polyhedron) is the smallest convex solid that contains all the points. For the great icosahedron, its 12 vertices are located at the same positions as the 12 vertices of a regular (convex) **icosahedron**. Therefore, the convex hull, or outer-hull, of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Analyze the task: \"triangulating the outer-hull\":** The task is to cover the surface of the outer-hull with a \"net\" of non-overlapping triangles. Since we've established that the outer-hull is a regular icosahedron, the question simplifies to: \"What is the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the surface of a regular icosahedron?\"\n\n4.  **Examine the structure of the outer-hull:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid. By its very definition, its surface is composed entirely of identical, regular triangles (specifically, 20 equilateral triangles).\n\n5.  **Determine the \"minimal number\":** The existing faces of the regular icosahedron already form a perfect triangulation of its surface. A triangulation is a partition of a surface into a set of triangles. Since the icosahedron's surface is already made of 20 triangles, this is a valid triangulation. Any attempt to further subdivide these faces (e.g., splitting each triangle into two or more smaller triangles) would result in a larger number of triangles. Therefore, the most efficient and minimal triangulation is the one provided by the inherent structure of the icosahedron itself.\n\n6.  **Consider the phrase \"visible from the outside\":** For a convex polyhedron like the regular icosahedron, all its faces are on the exterior surface and are therefore \"visible from the outside.\" This phrase simply confirms that we are concerned with the faces on the surface of the convex hull, not any internal structures.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is composed of 20 triangular faces. This is the minimal number of triangles required to form its surface.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction between Great Icosahedron and its Convex Hull:** It is crucial not to confuse the great icosahedron (a complex, self-intersecting star polyhedron) with its much simpler convex hull (a regular icosahedron). The question is about the hull, not the star polyhedron itself.\n*   **Meaning of \"Triangulation\":** A triangulation is a decomposition into triangles. The faces of the icosahedron already satisfy this definition perfectly.\n*   **Minimality:** The keyword \"minimal\" directs us to find the smallest possible number of triangles, which means avoiding any unnecessary subdivisions of the faces of the convex hull.\n\nThe number of triangles needed is simply the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron has **20** faces.\n\n<<<20>>>"
