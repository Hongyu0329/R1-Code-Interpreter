    "This question asks for the number of combinatorial types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve whose Jacobian has good reduction. This is a problem in algebraic geometry, which can be translated into a combinatorial enumeration problem.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the implication of \"Jacobian has good reduction\"\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of reduction of algebraic curves, due to Deligne, Rapoport, and Raynaud, states that a curve $C$ of genus $g \\ge 2$ has a Jacobian with good reduction if and only if the special fiber of its stable model is a **stable curve of compact type**.\n\nA stable curve is of *compact type* if its dual graph is a tree. The dual graph is a graph where vertices represent the irreducible components of the curve and edges represent the nodes connecting these components. That the graph is a tree means it is connected and has no cycles.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the combinatorial problem\n\nLet the stable reduction be the curve $C_k$, which is composed of $k$ irreducible components $C_1, \\ldots, C_k$.\n*   Let $g_i$ be the geometric genus of the component $C_i$.\n*   For a curve of compact type, the genus of the total curve is the sum of the genera of its components: $g = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} g_i$. In our case, $g=4$.\n*   The problem is to find all possible partitions of the integer 4 into a sum of non-negative integers $g_i$. Each such partition represents a possible assignment of genera to the components.\n*   The curve $C_k$ must be stable. The stability condition for a connected nodal curve states that its automorphism group is finite. For genus $g \\ge 2$, this imposes constraints on the components:\n    *   Any component $C_i$ that is a rational curve (i.e., $g_i = 0$, a $\\mathbb{P}^1$) must be attached to the other components at no fewer than 3 points (nodes). In terms of the dual graph, this means the vertex corresponding to a genus 0 component must have a degree of at least 3.\n    *   Any component $C_i$ that is an elliptic curve (i.e., $g_i = 1$) must be attached to other components at no fewer than 1 point. In a connected graph with more than one vertex, every vertex has a degree of at least 1, so this condition is automatically satisfied for any genus 1 component as long as the curve is not irreducible.\n*   A \"type\" of reduction is defined by the set of genera of the components and their configuration, which is captured by the (labeled) dual graph. Since the dual graph must be a tree, we are counting the number of distinct trees whose vertices are labeled by the genera, subject to the stability constraints.\n\n### Step 3: Classify based on the number of genus-0 components\n\nLet $k_0$ be the number of components with positive genus ($g_i > 0$) and $k_1$ be the number of components with genus 0. The total number of components is $k = k_0 + k_1$.\nThe sum of the genera of the $k_0$ positive-genus components is 4.\nThe $k_1$ vertices corresponding to genus-0 components in the dual tree must each have a degree of at least 3. The other $k_0$ vertices must have a degree of at least 1 (as the tree is connected).\n\nA key combinatorial constraint on a tree is that the sum of degrees is $2(k-1) = 2(k_0+k_1-1)$.\nThis leads to the inequality: $3k_1 + k_0 \\le \\sum \\text{degrees} = 2(k_0+k_1-1)$, which simplifies to **$k_1 \\le k_0 - 2$**.\n\nWe can now classify the types based on $k_1$:\n\n**Case A: No genus-0 components ($k_1=0$)**\nNo stability constraints on degrees. We count partitions of 4 into $k_0$ positive integers, and for each, we count the number of non-isomorphic labeled trees.\n1.  **Partition (4)**: $k_0=1$. A single component of genus 4. The graph is a point. **1 type**.\n2.  **Partition (3,1)**: $k_0=2$. Two components of genera 3 and 1. The only tree on 2 vertices is an edge. **1 type**.\n3.  **Partition (2,2)**: $k_0=2$. Two components of genus 2. Unique graph. **1 type**.\n4.  **Partition (2,1,1)**: $k_0=3$. Tree is a line. Genera {2,1,1}. Two ways to label: the central component can be genus 2 or genus 1. (1)-[2]-(1) and (2)-[1]-(1). **2 types**.\n5.  **Partition (1,1,1,1)**: $k_0=4$. All genera are 1. There are two non-isomorphic trees on 4 vertices: the line ($P_4$) and the star ($K_{1,3}$). **2 types**.\n*Total for $k_1=0$: $1+1+1+2+2 = 7$ types.*\n\n**Case B: One genus-0 component ($k_1=1$)**\nConstraint: $k_0 \\ge k_1+2=3$. We need a tree with one vertex of degree $\\ge 3$.\n1.  **$k_0=3$**: Partition (2,1,1) of 4. Total components {2,1,1,0}, $k=4$. The tree on 4 vertices must have a node of degree $\\ge 3$, which uniquely identifies it as the star graph $K_{1,3}$ (degrees 3,1,1,1). The g=0 component is the center. The g=2, g=1, g=1 components are the leaves. This is a unique configuration. **1 type**.\n2.  **$k_0=4$**: Partition (1,1,1,1) of 4. Total components {1,1,1,1,0}, $k=5$. We need trees on 5 vertices with a node of degree $\\ge 3$. There are two such trees:\n    *   Star graph $K_{1,4}$ (degrees 4,1,1,1,1). The g=0 component is the center.\n    *   A \"trident\" graph (a $P_3$ with a leaf attached to the middle, degrees 3,2,1,1,1). The g=0 component is the vertex of degree 3.\n    Both give a unique type. **2 types**.\n*Total for $k_1=1$: $1+2 = 3$ types.*\n\n**Case C: Two genus-0 components ($k_1=2$)**\nConstraint: $k_0 \\ge k_1+2=4$.\n1.  **$k_0=4$**: Partition (1,1,1,1) of 4. Total components {1,1,1,1,0,0}, $k=6$. We need a tree on 6 vertices with two vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. There is exactly one such tree (degrees 3,3,1,1,1,1; a central edge with two leaves attached to each end). The two g=0 components occupy the degree-3 vertices, and the four g=1 components are the leaves. This is a unique configuration. **1 type**.\n*Total for $k_1=2$: 1 type.*\n\n**Case D: Three or more genus-0 components ($k_1 \\ge 3$)**\nConstraint: $k_0 \\ge k_1+2 \\ge 5$. It is impossible to partition the integer 4 into 5 or more positive integers. So there are no such types.\n\n### Final Count\n\nSumming up the counts from all cases:\n*   $k_1=0$: 7 types\n*   $k_1=1$: 3 types\n*   $k_1=2$: 1 type\n*   $k_1 \\ge 3$: 0 types\n\nThe total number of types of stable reductions is $7 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\n<<<11>>>"
