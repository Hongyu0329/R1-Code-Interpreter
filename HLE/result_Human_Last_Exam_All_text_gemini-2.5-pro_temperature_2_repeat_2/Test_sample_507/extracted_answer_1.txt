Two languages that fit this description are Korean and Persian (Farsi).

*   **Mom**: The Korean word is *eomma* (엄마), which is highly similar to the informal Persian word *mâmân*.
*   **Dad**: The Korean word is *appa* (아빠), which is nearly identical to the informal Persian word *bâbâ*.
*   **Broom**: The Persian word is *jâru* (جارو). The Korean word is *bitjaru* (빗자루), which is a compound word where the morpheme *-jaru* means "handle" or "stick." The Persian word *jâru* is phonetically nearly identical to the Korean morpheme *-jaru*.

These similarities are coincidental, as Korean and Persian developed in complete isolation from one another in East and West Asia, respectively.
