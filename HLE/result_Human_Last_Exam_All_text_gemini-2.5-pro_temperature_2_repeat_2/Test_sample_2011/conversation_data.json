    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with n=128 vertices. Let's break this down:\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are considering a graph `G` with `V(G)` as its set of vertices, where `|V(G)| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is equivalent to the complete graph `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** A subgraph `H` is an induced subgraph of `G` if it can be formed by selecting a subset of vertices from `G` and taking *all* the edges from `G` that connect vertices in that subset.\n*   **A clique as an induced subgraph:** For a clique of size `k` to appear as an induced subgraph, there must exist a subset of `k` vertices in `G` such that all of them are mutually connected. This is precisely the definition of `G` having a clique of size `k`. The phrasing \"appear as an induced subgraph\" is the standard way of stating this, as a clique is defined by its vertex set and the property that the subgraph induced by this vertex set is complete.\n*   **Number of different clique sizes:** This is the count of distinct integers `k` (where `k >= 1`) for which the graph `G` contains a clique of size `k`.\n\nSo, the problem can be rephrased as: What is the maximum size of the set `S = {k | G contains a clique of size k}` for a single graph `G` with 128 vertices?\n\n**2. Analyze the Set of Clique Sizes**\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the set `S` for any given graph `G`.\n\n*   **Let `\\omega(G)` be the clique number of `G`**. The clique number is defined as the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n*   By definition, `\\omega(G)` is the maximum value in the set `S`. This means `\\omega(G) \\in S`, and for any `k > \\omega(G)`, `k \\notin S`.\n*   Now, let's consider if a graph `G` contains a clique of size `\\omega(G)`. Let this clique be formed by the set of vertices `V_max`, where `|V_max| = \\omega(G)`.\n*   Does `G` also contain a clique of size `k` for any `1 \\le k < \\omega(G)`? Yes. We can simply choose any subset `V_k` of `V_max` with `|V_k| = k`. Since every vertex in `V_max` is connected to every other vertex in `V_max`, the same must be true for the subset `V_k`. Therefore, the vertices in `V_k` form a clique of size `k`.\n*   This proves that if a graph `G` has a maximum clique of size `\\omega(G)`, it must also have cliques of all smaller integer sizes, from 1 up to `\\omega(G)`.\n*   Therefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G` is exactly `S = {1, 2, 3, ..., \\omega(G)}`.\n\n**3. Relate the Problem to Clique Number**\n\nFrom the previous step, we established that the number of different clique sizes in a graph `G` is `|S| = \\omega(G)`.\n\nThe question asks for the \"maximum possible number of different clique sizes\". This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible value of `|S|`, which is the same as finding the maximum possible value of `\\omega(G)` over all graphs with 128 vertices.\n\nSo, the problem is simplified to: **What is the maximum clique number of a graph on 128 vertices?**\n\n**4. Solve for the Maximum Clique Number**\n\n*   A clique in a graph is a subset of its vertices.\n*   For a graph `G` with `n` vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed `n`. Therefore, `\\omega(G) \\le n`.\n*   In our case, `n = 128`, so the maximum possible clique number is at most 128.\n*   We need to check if this maximum is achievable. A clique number of `n` can be achieved by the **complete graph**, `K_n`. The complete graph on `n` vertices is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n*   Consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, `K_{128}`. The set of all 128 vertices forms a clique of size 128. Thus, `\\omega(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128. Since the number of different clique sizes is equal to the clique number, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128. This is achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`, which contains induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Induced vs. Not Induced:** For cliques, this distinction is not critical, as any set of vertices forming a clique will induce a complete graph.\n*   **Maximal Cliques vs. All Cliques:** A common trap is to misinterpret the question as being about *maximal* cliques (cliques that cannot be extended). The question does not state this, and its wording (\"appear as induced subgraphs\") clearly points to considering all possible clique sizes, not just the maximal ones. If the question were about maximal clique sizes, the answer would be 15, derived from finding the largest `m` such that `1+2+...+m \\le 128`.\n*   **The Straightforward Nature of the Answer:** The question is phrased in a way that might suggest a more complex combinatorial answer. However, a step-by-step analysis based on the fundamental definitions of graph theory leads to a simple, direct conclusion.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum possible value for `\\omega(G)`, which is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
