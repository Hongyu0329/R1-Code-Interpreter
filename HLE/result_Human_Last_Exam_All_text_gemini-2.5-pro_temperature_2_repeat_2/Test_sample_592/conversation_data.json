    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for the specific US city where the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n2.  **Understand the characters and context:** In *Ovosodo*, the story revolves around the protagonist, Piero Mansani. Tommaso is his best friend from a wealthy family. A major theme of the movie is the contrast between their lives and the different paths they take after school.\n\n3.  **Focus on the character's journey:** While Piero's life remains largely centered in his hometown of Livorno, Tommaso's wealth and family connections allow him to leave Italy to study abroad. This move to the United States is a pivotal moment that signifies their diverging lives.\n\n4.  **Recall or research the specific plot point:** To find the city, we must recall the specific scenes or plot details where Tommaso's move is discussed. In the film, Tommaso communicates with Piero from his new location, sending letters and postcards.\n\n5.  **Verify the city name:** By consulting summaries and synopses of the film *Ovosodo*, it is confirmed that Tommaso moves to the United States to attend a university. The specific city mentioned in his correspondence with Piero is New York.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Distinguish the characters:** It is crucial not to confuse the character in question, Tommaso (the best friend who moves), with the film's protagonist, Piero (who stays in Italy).\n*   **Verify the film details:** Ensure the film is correctly identified as *Ovosodo* (1997), and the character is indeed Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci.\n*   **Source of the information:** The city is explicitly mentioned in the movie itself through the correspondence between Tommaso and Piero.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the US city Tommaso moves to.\n\n<<<New York>>>"
