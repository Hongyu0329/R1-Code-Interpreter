    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the pattern in the sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence and look for a primary relationship.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's examine the relationship between consecutive terms. We can check for simple differences or multiplication factors.\n\n*   **Differences:**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences (9, 12, 28, 68) do not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern at first glance.\n\n*   **Multiplication:** Let's see if the next term can be approximated by multiplying the current term by a constant.\n    *   11 / 2 = 5.5\n    *   23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n    *   51 / 23 ≈ 2.21\n    *   119 / 51 ≈ 2.33\n    Except for the first pair, the ratio is consistently around 2. This suggests a pattern of the form: `Next Term = 2 * Current Term + Some Value`.\n\n**Step 2: Define the pattern using multiplication and an additional term.**\nLet's test the formula `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + d_n`, where `d_n` is an additional term that might change with each step.\n\n*   For `n=1`: `a_2 = 2 * a_1 + d_1` => `11 = 2 * 2 + d_1` => `11 = 4 + d_1` => `d_1 = 7`.\n*   For `n=2`: `a_3 = 2 * a_2 + d_2` => `23 = 2 * 11 + d_2` => `23 = 22 + d_2` => `d_2 = 1`.\n*   For `n=3`: `a_4 = 2 * a_3 + d_3` => `51 = 2 * 23 + d_3` => `51 = 46 + d_3` => `d_3 = 5`.\n*   For `n=4`: `a_5 = 2 * a_4 + d_4` => `119 = 2 * 51 + d_4` => `119 = 102 + d_4` => `d_4 = 17`.\n\nSo, the sequence of the additional terms `d` is (7, 1, 5, 17, ...).\n\n**Step 3: Find the pattern within the sequence of additional terms.**\nThe sequence `d` is (7, 1, 5, 17, ...). Often in these puzzles, the first term can be an exception or a \"seed\" value. Let's ignore the first term (7) for a moment and analyze the sub-sequence `b = (1, 5, 17, ...)`. We need to find the next term in this sequence, `b_4`.\n\n*   Let's look at the differences within the sequence `b`:\n    *   `b_2 - b_1` = 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   `b_3 - b_2` = 17 - 5 = 12\n*   The sequence of differences is (4, 12, ...). We can see a clear pattern here: it is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term (12 = 4 * 3).\n*   Following this pattern, the next difference will be 12 * 3 = 36.\n*   Now we can find the next term of sequence `b`, which we'll call `b_4`.\n    *   `b_4 = b_3 + 36` => `b_4 = 17 + 36 = 53`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\nWe have found the next additional term, `d_5 = b_4 = 53`. Now we can calculate the missing number in the original sequence, `a_6`.\n*   The formula is `a_6 = 2 * a_5 + d_5`.\n*   `a_6 = 2 * 119 + 53`\n*   `a_6 = 238 + 53`\n*   `a_6 = 291`\n\nThe result 291 matches option A.\n\n**Final check of the steps:**\n1.  The sequence is `a_n`: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\n2.  The recursive rule is `a_{n+1} = 2a_n + d_n` for n ≥ 2, where `d_n` is another sequence.\n3.  The sequence `d_n` for n ≥ 2 is (1, 5, 17, ...).\n4.  The differences in this sequence are (4, 12, ...), which is a geometric progression with a ratio of 3.\n5.  The next difference is `12 * 3 = 36`.\n6.  The next term in `d` is `17 + 36 = 53`.\n7.  The next term in the main sequence is `2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\nThe logic is consistent and leads to one of the given answers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
