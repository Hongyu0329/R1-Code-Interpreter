    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DBE) is calculated using the formula: $DBE = C + 1 - \\frac{H}{2}$.\n*   $DBE = 7 + 1 - \\frac{14}{2} = 8 - 7 = 1$.\n*   A DBE of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\n*   **Number of Signals:** The spectrum shows 6 distinct signals. The molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms. This difference means there is some symmetry in the molecule, causing two of the carbon atoms to be chemically equivalent and produce an overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities (from off-resonance decoupling or DEPT):**\n    *   The letters (s, d, t, q) indicate the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon: (s) = singlet (0 H), (d) = doublet (1 H), (t) = triplet (2 H), (q) = quartet (3 H).\n    *   **145(s):** This signal is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The singlet multiplicity indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). This is a carbon atom in a C=C double bond, attached to two other carbon atoms.\n    *   **112(t):** This signal is also in the alkene region. The triplet multiplicity indicates a CH2 group. This represents a terminal alkene, a =CH2 group.\n    *   **Conclusion from Alkene Signals:** The presence of a quaternary carbon and a =CH2 group in the alkene region confirms a disubstituted terminal alkene structure (>C=CH2). This structure accounts for the one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **48(t):** This signal is in the aliphatic region (0-50 ppm). The triplet multiplicity indicates an sp3-hybridized -CH2- group. Its downfield shift suggests it might be allylic (next to the C=C bond).\n    *   **27(d):** This is in the aliphatic region. The doublet multiplicity indicates an sp3-hybridized -CH- group (a methine group).\n    *   **22(q):** This is in the aliphatic region. The quartet multiplicity indicates a -CH3 group (a methyl group).\n    *   **21(q):** This is in the aliphatic region. The quartet multiplicity indicates another, chemically distinct -CH3 group.\n\n**Step 3: Reconcile Carbon Count and Identify Equivalent Carbons**\n*   The 6 unique signals correspond to the following carbon types: one C(s, quat), one =CH2(t), one -CH2-(t), one -CH-(d), and two different -CH3(q) groups.\n*   This adds up to 6 carbon atoms. To account for the 7 carbons in the molecular formula, one of these signals must represent two carbons.\n*   Let's check the hydrogen count for these 6 signals: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11 hydrogens. The formula requires 14 hydrogens. We are missing C1H3.\n*   The missing C1H3 must come from a methyl group. This means that one of the quartet (q) signals represents two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n*   So, the fragments of the molecule are: >C=CH2, one -CH2- group, one -CH- group, one unique -CH3 group, and two equivalent -CH3 groups.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n*   Let's group the aliphatic fragments logically. The -CH- group and the two equivalent -CH3 groups strongly suggest an **isopropyl group**, -CH(CH3)2.\n*   The remaining -CH2- group and the unique -CH3 group form an **ethyl group**, -CH2CH3.\n*   The core of the molecule is the >C=CH2 unit. The quaternary carbon must be attached to the two alkyl groups we just identified.\n*   Therefore, the structure of the compound is the one where an ethyl group and an isopropyl group are attached to the quaternary carbon of a terminal alkene.\n    Structure: **CH2=C(CH2CH3)(CH(CH3)2)**\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   To name this alkene, we must find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond (C1 and C2).\n*   There are two choices for the longest chain, both being 4 carbons long:\n    1.  Choosing the chain through the ethyl group: CH2(1)=C(2)-CH2(3)-CH3(4). The parent chain is a 1-butene. It has one substituent, an isopropyl group, at position 2. The name would be **2-isopropyl-1-butene**. This name has 1 substituent.\n    2.  Choosing the chain through the isopropyl group: CH2(1)=C(2)-CH(3)-CH3(4). The parent chain is a 3-methyl-1-butene. It has one substituent, an ethyl group, at position 2. However, it's better described as having two substituents on the 1-butene main chain: an ethyl on C2 and a methyl on C3. The name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**. This name identifies 2 substituents.\n*   According to IUPAC rules, if two chains have equal maximum length, the principal chain is the one with the greater number of substituents.\n*   Choice 1 has one substituent, while Choice 2 results in a name with two substituents. Therefore, the second choice is correct.\n\nThe final IUPAC name of the compound is 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
