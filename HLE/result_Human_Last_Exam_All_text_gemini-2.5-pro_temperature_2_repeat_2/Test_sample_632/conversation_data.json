    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon church.\n    *   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature.\" This term can be interpreted broadly to include infrastructure and significant man-made elements that define the look and function of the square.\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed.\"\n    *   **Timeframe:** The removal happened \"in 1950\" or the feature existed \"until 1950.\"\n    *   **Agent:** The \"city administration\" was responsible.\n\n2.  **Examine Potential Candidates and Evaluate Them:**\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: The \"Donkey's Ears\" (Bell Towers):** The Pantheon once had two bell towers, added by the architect Bernini in the 17th century. They were widely disliked and derisively nicknamed \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the donkey's ears).\n        *   **Careful Point:** While they were a famous architectural feature that was removed, they were removed in **1883**, not 1950. This candidate is incorrect based on the timeline.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: The Market Stalls:** For centuries, the Piazza della Rotonda hosted a vibrant and chaotic market, particularly for fish and vegetables.\n        *   **Careful Point:** The major effort by the city administration to clear out the market and restore \"decorum\" to the square happened much earlier, in the **late 19th century** (1870s-1880s), after Rome became the capital of a unified Italy. This date does not match the question.\n\n    *   **Candidate 3: The Fountain (Fontana del Pantheon):** In the center of the piazza is a beautiful fountain designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1575, with an Egyptian obelisk added on top in 1711.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This feature was **not removed**. It is still a centerpiece of the piazza today. This candidate is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Candidate 4: Tram Tracks:** In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Rome developed an extensive tram network. A line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, passing right in front of the Pantheon. Old photographs clearly show the tracks and overhead wires as a dominant feature of the square's landscape.\n        *   **Careful Point:** Following World War II, the city of Rome began a process of modernizing its public transport. This involved dismantling many tram lines in the crowded and archaeologically sensitive historic center. The decision was made to reduce noise, visual clutter, traffic congestion, and potential damage from vibrations to ancient monuments like the Pantheon. The process of removing the central tram loop, including the tracks through Piazza della Rotonda, was completed around **1950**. This perfectly matches all criteria in the question: it was a significant man-made feature of the square, it was removed by the city administration, and the timing is correct.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n\nBy eliminating the other possibilities based on the critical detail of the removal date (1950), the only correct answer is the network of tram tracks. They were a defining, almost \"architectural,\" feature of the piazza's daily life and appearance for decades until their removal.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<The tram tracks>>>"
