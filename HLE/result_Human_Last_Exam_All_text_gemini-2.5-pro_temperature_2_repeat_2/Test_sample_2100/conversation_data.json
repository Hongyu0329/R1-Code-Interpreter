    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** Andrei Voznesensky, a famous Russian poet, called this man \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This points to a poem or a major work by Voznesensky about an explorer or traveler. The specific and unusual phrase \"joy-discovering sailor\" is a strong hint.\n*   **Clue 2:** Voznesensky also wrote, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" This indicates that at the time of writing, the man's burial site was unknown. This adds a layer of mystery and historical loss to the man's story.\n*   **Clue 3:** The answer to the question about the grave \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" This gives us a specific timeframe for a historical or archaeological discovery that resolved the mystery of the man's final resting place.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues**\n\n*   We are looking for a historical figure, likely a Russian explorer, who was the subject of a famous work by Andrei Voznesensky.\n*   The work must have been written at a time when the man's grave was considered lost.\n*   The grave must have been rediscovered or identified in the late 1980s.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Work and the Man**\n\n*   The quotes provided are from the prologue of Andrei Voznesensky's libretto for the famous Russian rock opera **\"Juno and Avos\"** (\"Юнона и Авось\").\n*   The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is Count **Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov** (1764-1807). Rezanov was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. He undertook a famous sea voyage to Russian possessions in Alaska and then to California. This aligns perfectly with the \"sailor\" description. The \"joy-discovering\" part is a poetic reference to his tragic love story with Concepción Argüello in California, a central plot point of the opera.\n*   Checking the history of Rezanov's death: He died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 on his way back to St. Petersburg. He was buried there, but the cathedral cemetery where he was interred was destroyed during the Soviet period, and the location of his grave was lost. This confirms the accuracy of Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave...?\"\n*   Checking the discovery of the grave: Due to the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos,\" public interest in finding Rezanov's grave grew. In the late 1970s and 1980s, during the era of Glasnost, investigations and archaeological efforts led to the presumed rediscovery of his grave site. This event, where the \"answer emerged,\" fits the timeline given in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe man described in the question is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
