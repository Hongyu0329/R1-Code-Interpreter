    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine which ballet step ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze each ballet step\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front of the left).\n*   **Execution:** *Entrechat* means \"interweaving\" or \"braiding,\" and *six* refers to six movements (three openings and three closings, or \"beats\"). It is a vertical jump from two feet. In the air, the legs beat against each other three times.\n*   **Ending Position:** Authoritative ballet dictionaries (such as the American Ballet Theatre's) and standard professional execution define an *entrechat six* as a jump that lands in the very same fifth position from which it started. The complex series of beats is designed to return the feet to their original configuration. For example, starting with the right foot front, you land with the right foot front.\n*   **Careful Point:** While descriptions of the exact mechanics of the beats can be confusing, the defined outcome of the complete step is a return to the starting position. Even-numbered entrechats (like *six* and *huit*) typically return to the original position.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** A closed position, usually fifth.\n*   **Execution:** This is a compound step. *Échappé* means \"to escape,\" where the dancer jumps from a closed position to an open one (e.g., second position). *Battu* means a beat is added. *Changé* means \"changed.\" After jumping to the open position, the dancer executes a second jump to return to fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** The word *changé* explicitly tells us the ending position is different from the starting one. If you start with the right foot in front, you will end with the left foot in front.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Usually from fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" The step begins by brushing one leg out to the side, front, or back. The dancer then jumps off the supporting leg, brings both legs together in the air, and lands on both feet simultaneously in fifth position. In standard forms like *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), the working leg that initiated the brush lands in a new relationship to the other foot, changing which foot is in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** An *assemblé* almost always changes the feet. For example, starting with the right foot in front and performing an *assemblé dessus* with the back (left) leg, the dancer will land with the left foot in front.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Usually from fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** *Glissade* means \"to glide,\" and it's a traveling step often used to link other, larger jumps. *Derrière* means \"behind.\" In its common form as a linking step, a *glissade* changes feet to prepare for the next movement. For example, starting with the right foot in front, a standard *glissade derrière* would finish with the left foot in front.\n*   **Careful Point:** While a non-changing version (*glissade sans changé*) exists, if not specified, a linking *glissade* is assumed to change feet.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Usually from fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** A *gargouillade* (\"gurgling\" or \"rumbling\") is a complex, decorative jump similar to a *pas de chat*, where both legs execute a small circular action (*rond de jambe*) in the air.\n*   **Ending Position:** The definition of the landing for a *gargouillade* is not universal. Some methods teach it to close in the original fifth position, while others state it can close with either foot in front, or even land on one leg with the other extended.\n*   **Careful Point:** Because the ending is not consistently defined as being the same as the start, it is not the best answer. The question asks which step *has* the same ending position, implying this is a defining characteristic.\n\n### Step 2: Compare the results\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** Starts and ends in the same position.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** Feet change.\n*   **Assemblé:** Feet change.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** Feet change in its common form.\n*   **Gargouillade:** Ending is variable.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe only step among the choices that is defined by starting and ending in the same leg position is the **Entrechat six**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
