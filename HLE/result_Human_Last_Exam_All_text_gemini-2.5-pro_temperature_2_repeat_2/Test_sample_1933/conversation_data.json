    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where $S$ is a schema with 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the components of the question\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A structure $M$ over this schema will have a universe of discourse $U$ and interpretations for these predicates, which are subsets of $U$, i.e., $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M \\subseteq U$.\n\n2.  **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of first-order logic.\n    *   Formulas are built using atomic formulas $P_i(v)$ (where $v$ is a variable).\n    *   Allowed logical operators are conjunction ($\\land$), existential quantification ($\\exists$), the constant true ($\\top$), and the constant false ($\\bot$).\n    *   We are interested in formulas $\\phi(x)$ with exactly one free variable, $x$. These formulas define subsets (or \"concepts\") of the universe $U$. For a given structure $M$, a formula $\\phi(x)$ defines the set $\\{ a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\phi(a) \\}$.\n\n3.  **VC Dimension**: The VC dimension of a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ is the size of the largest finite set $Y$ of points that can be **shattered** by $\\mathcal{C}$. A set $Y$ is shattered if for every subset $Z \\subseteq Y$, there is a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $Z = Y \\cap C$. The VC dimension we are looking for is the maximum possible VC dimension over all possible structures $M$ for the schema $S$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of the definable sets\n\nLet $\\phi(x)$ be any formula in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with one free variable $x$.\nSince the schema $S$ only contains unary predicates, any atomic formula is of the form $P_i(v)$ for some variable $v$.\nA formula in this fragment has the general form $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas.\nWe can separate the atomic formulas in $\\psi$ based on whether they involve the free variable $x$ or a bound variable $y_j$.\nSo, $\\psi$ can be written as:\n$\\psi(x, \\mathbf{y}) = \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)\\right) \\land \\left(\\bigwedge_{j \\in J} \\alpha_j(\\mathbf{y})\\right)$\nwhere $I$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, and each $\\alpha_j(\\mathbf{y})$ is an atom using only variables from $\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, \\dots, y_m)$.\n\nThus, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)\\right) \\land \\left(\\exists \\mathbf{y} \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} \\alpha_j(\\mathbf{y})\\right)$\n\nThe second part, $\\theta = \\exists \\mathbf{y} \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} \\alpha_j(\\mathbf{y})$, is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). For any given structure $M$, this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If $M \\models \\theta$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. The set defined is $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$. The case $I=\\emptyset$ corresponds to the formula $\\top$, which defines the entire universe $U$.\n*   If $M \\not\\models \\theta$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (since $\\phi(x)$ becomes a conjunction with a false part). The set defined is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n\nSo, for any given structure $M$, the collection of definable sets (the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$) is a subset of the collection of all possible intersections of the predicate interpretations $\\{P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M\\}$, plus the empty set.\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_M = \\{P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M\\}$. Let $\\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal{H}_M)$ be the set of all intersections of subsets of $\\mathcal{H}_M$. Then $\\mathcal{C}_M \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal{H}_M)$.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a lower bound on the VC dimension (VC-dim $\\ge 4$)\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we need to construct a structure $M$ and a set $Y$ of size 4 that can be shattered.\n\n*   Let the universe be $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$.\n*   For each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, define the interpretation of the predicate $P_i$ as $P_i^M = Y \\setminus \\{y_i\\}$.\n*   We must show that any subset $Z \\subseteq Y$ can be represented as an intersection of these sets $P_i^M$.\n*   Let $Z$ be an arbitrary subset of $Y$. Let $I_Z = \\{ i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\mid y_i \\notin Z \\}$. Consider the formula $\\phi_Z(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_Z} P_i(x)$. This is a valid formula in our fragment.\n*   The set defined by this formula is $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_Z} P_i^M = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Z} (Y \\setminus \\{y_i\\}) = Y \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_Z} \\{y_i\\}$.\n*   By our definition of $I_Z$, $\\bigcup_{i \\in I_Z} \\{y_i\\} = \\{ y_i \\mid y_i \\notin Z \\} = Y \\setminus Z$.\n*   So the defined set is $Y \\setminus (Y \\setminus Z) = Z$.\n\nSince we can form a concept for every subset $Z$ of $Y$, the set $Y$ is shattered. The size of $Y$ is 4. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 4: Establish an upper bound on the VC dimension (VC-dim $\\le 4$)\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at most 4, we must prove that for any structure $M$, no set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\n*   Let $k=4$ be the number of predicates. The concept class for any structure $M$, $\\mathcal{C}_M$, is a subset of the class of concepts formed by intersections of the $k$ base sets $P_1^M, \\dots, P_k^M$. Let's denote these base sets as $H_1, \\dots, H_k$.\n*   It is a known result that the VC dimension of a concept class formed by all intersections of $k$ sets is exactly $k$. Let's sketch the proof for our case.\n*   Assume for contradiction that there exists a structure $M$ and a set $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5\\}$ of size 5 that can be shattered.\n*   For each point $y_j \\in Y$, associate a binary vector $v_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$, where the $i$-th component $(v_j)_i$ is 1 if $y_j \\in H_i$ and 0 otherwise.\n*   We now have 5 vectors $v_1, \\dots, v_5$ in the 4-dimensional real space $\\mathbb{R}^4$. Any set of 5 vectors in a 4-dimensional space must be linearly dependent.\n*   Thus, there exist real coefficients $c_1, \\dots, c_5$, not all zero, such that $\\sum_{j=1}^5 c_j v_j = \\mathbf{0}$.\n*   Partition the indices $\\{1, \\dots, 5\\}$ into two sets: $P = \\{ j \\mid c_j > 0 \\}$ and $N = \\{ j \\mid c_j < 0 \\}$. Since not all $c_j$ are zero and their weighted sum is zero, both $P$ and $N$ must be non-empty. Let $b_j = -c_j$ for $j \\in N$. We have $\\sum_{j \\in P} c_j v_j = \\sum_{j \\in N} b_j v_j$, where all $c_j, b_j > 0$.\n*   Since we assumed $Y$ is shattered, the subset $Z = \\{y_j \\mid j \\in P\\}$ must be definable by some concept. That is, there exists an index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ such that $Z = Y \\cap \\bigcap_{i \\in I} H_i$.\n*   This implies two conditions:\n    1.  For every $j \\in P$, $y_j \\in \\bigcap_{i \\in I} H_i$. This means for all $j \\in P$ and all $i \\in I$, $(v_j)_i=1$.\n    2.  For every $l \\in N$, $y_l \\notin \\bigcap_{i \\in I} H_i$. This means for each $l \\in N$, there is at least one $i \\in I$ for which $(v_l)_i=0$.\n*   From condition 1, for any $i \\in I$, the $i$-th coordinate of the linear dependency equation becomes: $\\sum_{j \\in P} c_j(1) = \\sum_{l \\in N} b_l (v_l)_i$, so $\\sum_{j \\in P} c_j = \\sum_{l \\in N} b_l (v_l)_i$.\n*   Summing over all $i \\in I$ (assuming $I$ is not empty, otherwise $Z=Y$, contradicting $N \\ne \\emptyset$):\n    $|I| \\sum_{j \\in P} c_j = \\sum_{i \\in I} \\sum_{l \\in N} b_l (v_l)_i = \\sum_{l \\in N} b_l \\left(\\sum_{i \\in I} (v_l)_i\\right)$.\n*   From condition 2, for each $l \\in N$, we know that vector $v_l$ is not all 1s on the coordinates in $I$. Thus, $\\sum_{i \\in I} (v_l)_i < |I|$.\n*   Therefore, $\\sum_{l \\in N} b_l \\left(\\sum_{i \\in I} (v_l)_i\\right) < \\sum_{l \\in N} b_l |I| = |I| \\sum_{l \\in N} b_l$.\n*   This leads to $|I| \\sum_{j \\in P} c_j < |I| \\sum_{l \\in N} b_l$, which simplifies to $\\sum_{j \\in P} c_j < \\sum_{l \\in N} b_l$.\n*   However, since $Y$ is shattered, the set $Z' = \\{y_j \\mid j \\in N\\}$ must also be definable. A symmetric argument for $Z'$ would lead to the conclusion $\\sum_{l \\in N} b_l < \\sum_{j \\in P} c_j$.\n*   The two inequalities form a contradiction. Thus, our initial assumption that a set of size 5 can be shattered must be false.\n\nThis proves that the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 3, we have VC-dim $\\ge 4$.\nFrom Step 4, we have VC-dim $\\le 4$.\nTherefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ must be exactly 4."
