    "This problem asks for the maximum possible number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua. To solve this, we will analyze the properties of composants and how they relate to the structure of continua, particularly their decomposability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Definitions**\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A *proper* subcontinuum is one that is not equal to the entire space.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `K`, its composant, `C(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in `K` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `K` containing both `p` and `q`. The composants of a continuum partition the space into equivalence classes.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   A continuum `K` is **decomposable** if it is the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   A continuum `K` is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Number of Composants to Decomposability**\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory describes the number of composants a continuum can have:\n*   If a continuum `K` is **decomposable**, it has exactly **one** composant, which is the space `K` itself.\n*   If a continuum `K` is **indecomposable**, it has **uncountably many** composants. Specifically, the number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (i.e., the cardinality of the real numbers, `2^ℵ₀`).\n\nFrom this theorem, we know that the number of composants of any given continuum can only be 1 or `c`. The question asks for the *largest possible number*, which would be `c`, provided it's possible to construct a product of two nondegenerate continua that has `c` composants. This is equivalent to asking if the product `X × Y` can be an indecomposable continuum.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Decomposability of the Product Space `X × Y`**\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. Their product `K = X × Y`, with the product topology, is also a continuum (the product of compact spaces is compact, the product of connected spaces is connected, and the product of metric spaces is metrizable).\n\nTo determine if `K = X × Y` can be indecomposable, we rely on a deep result by J. Krasinkiewicz (1980). This theorem gives a complete characterization of when the product of two continua is decomposable.\n\n**Krasinkiewicz's Theorem:** The product `X × Y` of two continua is **decomposable** if and only if at least one of the following conditions holds:\n1.  `X` is decomposable.\n2.  `Y` is decomposable.\n3.  `X` is **arc-like** (also known as chainable). An arc-like continuum is one that can be represented as an inverse limit of intervals `[0, 1]`.\n4.  `Y` is arc-like.\n\nFor the product `K = X × Y` to be **indecomposable**, the negation of the conditions in Krasinkiewicz's theorem must be true. That is, **all** of the following must hold:\n*   `X` must be indecomposable.\n*   `Y` must be indecomposable.\n*   `X` must not be arc-like.\n*   `Y` must not be arc-like.\n\n**Step 4: Find Continua `X` and `Y` that Satisfy the Conditions for Indecomposability**\nThe final step is to determine if there exist two nondegenerate continua that satisfy all four of these conditions. We need examples of continua that are both indecomposable and not arc-like.\n\n*   **Knaster Continua (Bucket-Handles):** These are indecomposable, but they are also arc-like. So if `X` and `Y` were both Knaster continua, their product would be decomposable (and have only 1 composant).\n*   **Solenoids:** A solenoid (for example, the dyadic solenoid `S_2`) is a classic example of a continuum that is **indecomposable**. Furthermore, solenoids are *not* arc-like. They are circle-like but not arc-like. They are also clearly nondegenerate.\n\nTherefore, we can choose `X` and `Y` to both be the dyadic solenoid, `S_2`. With this choice:\n*   `X = S_2` is a nondegenerate continuum. It is indecomposable and not arc-like.\n*   `Y = S_2` is a nondegenerate continuum. It is indecomposable and not arc-like.\n\nAccording to the analysis in Step 3, the product `K = S_2 × S_2` is an **indecomposable** continuum.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nSince we have shown that it is possible to construct a product of two nondegenerate continua `K = X × Y` that is indecomposable, this product `K` must have `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) composants. As the only possible numbers of composants are 1 and `c`, the largest possible number is `c`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly identify the possible numbers of composants:** The number of composants of a continuum is strictly either 1 (for decomposable continua) or `c` (for indecomposable continua). There are no other possibilities.\n2.  **Product Space Properties:** The product of two continua is a continuum. This is a prerequisite for discussing its composants.\n3.  **Krasinkiewicz's Theorem:** This theorem is the crucial tool. Misstating its conditions (e.g., forgetting the arc-like condition) would lead to an incorrect conclusion.\n4.  **Existence of an Example:** The argument is only complete if we can prove the existence of continua that are indecomposable but not arc-like. Solenoids serve as this essential example.\n5.  **Interpreting \"Number\":** The question asks for the largest \"number\", which in this context is a cardinal number. The answer, `c`, represents the cardinality of the continuum, an uncountable infinity.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
