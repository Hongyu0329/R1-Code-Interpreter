    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against a powerful quantum computer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Threat**: The question asks about cracking a symmetric key with an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer\". The primary method to \"crack\" a symmetric key is a brute-force search, where the attacker tries every possible key until the correct one is found.\n2.  **Classical Brute-Force Attack**: For a symmetric key of length 'n' bits, there are 2^n possible keys. A classical computer would, on average, have to try half of these keys, so the computational effort is on the order of O(2^n). This is known as having 'n' bits of security. For example, a 128-bit key like AES-128 has 128 bits of classical security.\n3.  **Quantum Brute-Force Attack**: A sufficiently powerful quantum computer can use **Grover's algorithm** to significantly speed up unstructured search problems like brute-forcing a key. Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up.\n4.  **Impact of Grover's Algorithm**: Instead of O(N) operations for a search space of size N (where N=2^n), Grover's algorithm can find the correct key in O(√N) operations.\n    *   N = 2^n (total number of keys)\n    *   √N = √(2^n) = 2^(n/2)\n    *   This means a quantum computer attack reduces the effective security strength of a symmetric key from 'n' bits to 'n/2' bits.\n5.  **Determine the Required Security Level**: The industry standard for a strong level of security, sufficient to withstand attacks from even the most powerful foreseeable computers (including quantum), is **128 bits of security**. This means an attack would require a number of operations on the order of 2^128, which is considered computationally infeasible.\n6.  **Calculate the Minimum Key Length**: We need the *post-quantum* security level to be at least 128 bits. Let 'k' be the required key length.\n    *   Post-Quantum Security = k / 2\n    *   We set our target: k / 2 ≥ 128 bits\n    *   Solving for 'k': k ≥ 2 * 128\n    *   Therefore, k ≥ 256 bits.\n7.  **Review the Choices**:\n    *   **A. 256**: A 256-bit key provides 256/2 = 128 bits of security against a quantum attack. This meets the required 128-bit security level.\n    *   **B. 128**: A 128-bit key provides 128/2 = 64 bits of security against a quantum attack. 2^64 operations are potentially feasible for a large-scale adversary, so this is not considered secure.\n    *   **C, D, E (512, 1024, 2048)**: These key sizes provide 256, 512, and 1024 bits of quantum security, respectively. While they are secure, the question asks for the *minimum* length required.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The question assumes a \"sufficiently powerful\" quantum computer exists, which is currently a theoretical construct.\n*   The analysis relies on Grover's algorithm being the most effective quantum attack against symmetric ciphers, which is the current consensus in the cryptographic community.\n*   The 128-bit security level is a widely accepted standard (e.g., by NIST - the US National Institute of Standards and Technology). To achieve this security level post-quantum, symmetric key lengths must be doubled. Hence, AES-128 is considered vulnerable, while AES-256 is considered quantum-resistant.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nTo achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm, one must use a symmetric key of at least 256 bits.\n\n<<<A>>>"
