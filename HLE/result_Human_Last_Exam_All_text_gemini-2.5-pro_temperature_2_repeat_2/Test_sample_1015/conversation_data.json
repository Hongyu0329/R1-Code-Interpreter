    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, followed by the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the term *Cambré Derrière***\n*   *Cambré* is a French ballet term meaning \"arched.\"\n*   *Derrière* means \"to the back.\"\n*   Therefore, a *cambré derrière* is a bend of the upper body backward from the waist. It is a fundamental movement taught at the barre and used in center work. It requires flexibility in the upper and middle back, as well as strong core and back muscles for support and control.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's approach to *Cambré Derrière***\n*   **Emphasis:** The Vaganova method, developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, emphasizes strength, clean lines, and a structured, logical progression of training. Safety and anatomical correctness are paramount.\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   The bend is initiated from the upper back (thoracic spine), lifting the sternum (breastbone) towards the ceiling.\n    *   Crucially, to support the spine and prevent injury, the hips are pushed slightly **forward** as the upper body bends back. This acts as a counterbalance and ensures the weight stays over the balls of the feet.\n    *   The lower back (lumbar spine) is kept long and supported, not compressed or \"crunched.\"\n    *   The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back without dropping heavily.\n    *   The goal is a graceful, supported, and controlled arc of the upper body.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's approach to *Cambré Derrière***\n*   **Emphasis:** The Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine, is known for its speed, dynamism, musicality, and exaggerated lines. It often pushes classical technique to its aesthetic limits.\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   The backbend is often deeper and more dramatic.\n    *   The most significant technical difference lies in the hip placement. Instead of pushing the hips forward, the Balanchine style often allows the hip of the standing leg to release or press **backward**.\n    *   This release of the hip changes the body's alignment, allowing for a deeper and faster backbend. It creates a \"broken,\" angular line that Balanchine favored aesthetically.\n    *   This backward hip placement makes the movement inherently less stable and more dynamic, aligning with the overall style's emphasis on risk and speed.\n    *   The head often drops back more completely, accentuating the depth of the bend.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods based on the key differences and evaluate the answer choices.**\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there can be stylistic nuances, the basic arm positions (e.g., fifth position en haut) for a cambré are similar in both methods. This is not the primary distinguishing factor.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core technical difference. Vaganova pushes the hips **forward** for support. Balanchine allows the hips to release **backward** for a different aesthetic and deeper bend. This is a fundamental divergence in the mechanics of the step.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a cambré can be performed at various tempos in either technique depending on the exercise or choreography. Speed is a quality of the performance, not a defining technical difference of the movement itself.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** Balanchine backbends are often deeper, but this is a *result* of the technique (specifically the hip placement), not the foundational difference itself. A flexible Vaganova dancer can also perform a deep cambré while maintaining the correct forward hip placement.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement in both methods follows the line of the spine. The more extreme look in the Balanchine version is a consequence of the deeper bend, which is enabled by the hip placement. The principle is the same; the outcome differs due to the foundational hip action.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most fundamental and defining difference in the technique and execution of a cambré derrière between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
