    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Question**\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ that have a specific conductor $N=36036$ and a specific order of 6.\n\n### **2. Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Dirichlet Character:** A function $\\chi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ that is completely multiplicative, periodic, and non-zero only for integers coprime to its modulus.\n*   **Conductor of a Character:** The smallest modulus $m$ for which the character can be defined. A character modulo $N$ is **primitive** if its conductor is $N$.\n*   **Order of a Character:** The smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\chi(a)^k = 1$ for all $a$ with $\\gcd(a,N)=1$.\n*   **Structure Theorem for Characters:** A character $\\chi$ modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n*   **Condition for Primitive Characters:** A character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n*   **Order of a Product Character:** The order of $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters $\\chi_i$. That is, $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N.**\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\cdot 3^2) \\times (7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13)$.\nSo the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the problem to component characters.**\nLet $\\chi$ be a primitive character of conductor $N$. It must decompose as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character with conductor $p^a$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ must be 6:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number and orders of primitive characters for each prime power factor.**\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order $k$ modulo $p^a$, denoted $N_{prim}(p^a, k)$, can be found using the formula $N_{prim}(p^a, k) = N(p^a, k) - N(p^{a-1}, k)$, where $N(m, k)$ is the total number of characters of order $k$ modulo $m$. $N(m,k)$ is the number of elements of order $k$ in the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$):**\n    *   The group of characters mod 4, $G(4)$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. It has one character of order 2.\n    *   The group $G(2)$ is trivial ($C_1$), with one character of order 1.\n    *   $N_{prim}(4, k)$ is non-zero only for $k=2$.\n    *   $N_{prim}(4, 2) = N(4, 2) - N(2, 2) = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n    *   So there is **1** primitive character mod 4, and its order must be **2**.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$):**\n    *   $G(9) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(9)} = C_6$. Orders can be 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   $G(3) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. Orders can be 1, 2.\n    *   We need the order to divide 6. Let's check $k=1,2,3,6$.\n    *   $N_{prim}(9, 3) = N(9, 3) - N(3, 3) = \\phi(3) - 0 = 2$.\n    *   $N_{prim}(9, 6) = N(9, 6) - N(3, 6) = \\phi(6) - 0 = 2$.\n    *   The other orders $k=1,2$ yield $N_{prim}(9,k)=0$.\n    *   So, primitive characters mod 9 must have order **3 or 6**. There are **2** of order 3 and **2** of order 6.\n\n*   **Conductor 7:**\n    *   $G(7) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$.\n    *   Since 7 is prime, we subtract characters from conductor 1 ($G(1)$ is trivial).\n    *   Orders must divide 6.\n    *   $N_{prim}(7, 2) = N(7, 2) - N(1, 2) = \\phi(2) - 0 = 1$.\n    *   $N_{prim}(7, 3) = N(7, 3) - N(1, 3) = \\phi(3) - 0 = 2$.\n    *   $N_{prim}(7, 6) = N(7, 6) - N(1, 6) = \\phi(6) - 0 = 2$.\n    *   Primitive characters mod 7 can have order **2, 3, or 6**. There are **1, 2, and 2** of them respectively.\n\n*   **Conductor 11:**\n    *   $G(11) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$.\n    *   Orders must divide 6. Only possible order (other than 1) is 2.\n    *   $N_{prim}(11, 2) = N(11, 2) - N(1, 2) = \\phi(2) - 0 = 1$.\n    *   So there is **1** primitive character mod 11 of an order that divides 6, and its order must be **2**.\n\n*   **Conductor 13:**\n    *   $G(13) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$.\n    *   Orders must divide 6.\n    *   $N_{prim}(13, 2) = N(13, 2) - N(1, 2) = \\phi(2) - 0 = 1$.\n    *   $N_{prim}(13, 3) = N(13, 3) - N(1, 3) = \\phi(3) - 0 = 2$.\n    *   $N_{prim}(13, 6) = N(13, 6) - N(1, 6) = \\phi(6) - 0 = 2$.\n    *   Primitive characters mod 13 can have order **2, 3, or 6**. There are **1, 2, and 2** of them respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to find the total count.**\n\nWe need to choose one primitive character for each prime power factor $p^a$ to construct a primitive character for $N$. Let their orders be $k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13}$.\n\nThe possible orders are:\n*   $k_4 = 2$\n*   $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $k_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $k_{11} = 2$\n*   $k_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe order of the resulting character is $\\text{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$. We need this to be 6.\n\n1.  **Lower bound on the lcm:**\n    *   Since one component must be a primitive character mod 4, its order is $k_4 = 2$. Therefore, the lcm must be a multiple of 2.\n    *   Since one component must be a primitive character mod 9, its order is $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. In either case, $k_9$ is a multiple of 3. Therefore, the lcm must be a multiple of 3.\n    *   Since the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Upper bound on the lcm:**\n    *   The order of each component character ($k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13}$) is a divisor of 6.\n    *   The lcm of numbers that all divide 6 must also divide 6.\n\nFrom 1 and 2, the order of *any* primitive character with conductor $N=36036$ must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$. We find this by multiplying the number of choices for each component character.\n\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: **1** (the character of order 2).\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: **2** (of order 3) + **2** (of order 6) = **4**.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: **1** (of order 2) + **2** (of order 3) + **2** (of order 6) = **5**.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: **1** (the character of order 2).\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: **1** (of order 2) + **2** (of order 3) + **2** (of order 6) = **5**.\n\nTotal number of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$, which is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
