    "This problem asks for the number of topologically distinct types of objects that satisfy a specific set of properties: being a continuum, being planar, and being homogeneous. We will solve this by breaking down the problem based on key topological distinctions and applying major classification theorems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\nFirst, let's be precise about what the question is asking for.\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space.\n*   **Planar:** Can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of the plane.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space is homogeneous if it \"looks the same\" from every point. Formally, for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism *h* from the space to itself such that *h(x) = y*.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are not counting every single possible space, but rather the number of fundamentally different shapes. Two spaces are in the same class if they are homeomorphic (i.e., one can be continuously deformed into the other).\n\n**Step 2: Classify by Degeneracy**\n\nThe simplest way to start classifying any collection of topological spaces is to separate the trivial case from the non-trivial ones.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must consider degenerate continua (spaces with only a single point).\n\n*   **Case 1: The Degenerate Continuum**\n    *   This is simply a **single point**.\n    *   Is it a continuum? Yes (non-empty, compact, connected).\n    *   Is it planar? Yes.\n    *   Is it homogeneous? Yes, trivially.\n    *   All single-point spaces are homeomorphic. This gives us our first class.\n    *   **Class 1: The Point.**\n\n**Step 3: Classify Non-Degenerate Continua by Separation of the Plane**\n\nNow, we consider non-degenerate continua (those with more than one point). For continua in the plane, a fundamental dividing property is whether they separate the plane into multiple disconnected regions.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A non-degenerate planar continuum either separates the plane or it does not. This provides a clear-cut division for our analysis.\n\n*   **Case 2: Non-Degenerate and Does NOT Separate the Plane**\n    *   There is a celebrated theorem by R. H. Bing (1951) that precisely classifies these objects.\n    *   **Theorem (Bing):** Any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane is homeomorphic to the **pseudo-arc**.\n    *   The pseudo-arc is a well-known \"pathological\" but fascinating object. It is snake-like, indecomposable (cannot be split into two smaller continua), and not locally connected.\n    *   **Class 2: The Pseudo-arc.**\n\n*   **Case 3: Non-Degenerate and DOES Separate the Plane**\n    *   These are continua that, when embedded in the plane, act like a \"fence,\" dividing the plane into an \"inside\" and an \"outside\" (and possibly more complex regions).\n    *   **Careful Point:** To further classify this case, we use another topological property: local connectedness. A crucial theorem implies that a homogeneous continuum is either locally connected everywhere or nowhere locally connected. It cannot be locally connected at some points but not others.\n\n    *   **Subcase 3a: Separating and Locally Connected**\n        *   A classical theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz addresses this situation.\n        *   **Theorem (Mazurkiewicz):** A non-degenerate, locally connected, homogeneous continuum must be a **simple closed curve** (i.e., homeomorphic to a circle).\n        *   The circle is indeed planar, homogeneous, and separates the plane.\n        *   **Class 3: The Simple Closed Curve (Circle).**\n\n    *   **Subcase 3b: Separating and Not Locally Connected**\n        *   This is the final possibility: a homogeneous, planar continuum that separates the plane but is not locally connected.\n        *   Such an object does exist. It is known as the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. It can be visualized as a continuous family of pseudo-arcs whose endpoints are arranged to form a circle. It contains a \"hole,\" so it separates the plane, but it inherits the non-local-connectedness of the pseudo-arcs it is made from.\n        *   A deep and complete classification theorem by L. Fearnley, J. Fugate, and T. Ingram confirms that this is the only object in this category.\n        *   **Class 4: The Circle of Pseudo-arcs.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy systematically breaking down the problem using fundamental topological properties (degeneracy, separation of the plane, local connectedness) and applying the major classification theorems from the field of continuum theory, we have exhausted all possibilities and found exactly four distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\nThe four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are represented by:\n1.  The **Point**\n2.  The **Pseudo-arc**\n3.  The **Simple Closed Curve** (or Circle)\n4.  The **Circle of Pseudo-arcs**\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 4 such classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
