    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and the specific military campaign.**\nThe question refers to a \"major defeat\" of the Ming General Mu Sheng (Mộc Thạnh in Vietnamese) in Vietnam. Mu Sheng was involved in two major campaigns in Vietnam:\n1.  The initial Ming conquest of the Hồ Dynasty (Ming–Hồ War, 1406–1407). In this war, Mu Sheng was largely successful.\n2.  The campaign to suppress the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi (1418–1427). It was during this conflict that the Ming forces, including those under Mu Sheng's command, suffered significant setbacks. His \"first major defeat\" refers to his role in this later war.\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint the specific event of Mu Sheng's defeat.**\nIn late 1427, the Ming Dynasty dispatched two large reinforcement armies to save their besieged forces in Dongguan (modern-day Hanoi). One army, led by Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng), came from Guangxi. The other, a 50,000-strong force led by Mu Sheng, came from Yunnan.\nThe Vietnamese forces under Lê Lợi first focused on destroying Liu Sheng's army, which they accomplished in the decisive Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang.\nAfter Liu Sheng's army was annihilated, the Vietnamese turned their attention to Mu Sheng's approaching army. This campaign would be Mu Sheng's first direct and major confrontation with the main Lam Sơn forces, and it ended disastrously for him.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the battles that constituted Mu Sheng's defeat.**\nUpon hearing the catastrophic news of Liu Sheng's destruction, Mu Sheng's army, which was advancing along the Red River (Sông Thao) and Lô River (Sông Lô) valleys, lost its morale. The Vietnamese generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả were sent to intercept them. They set up a series of well-planned ambushes.\n*   **The Battle of Lãnh Câu Pass (Ải Lãnh Câu):** The Vietnamese forces ambushed and defeated Mu Sheng's vanguard here on the Lô River.\n*   **The Battle of Đan Xá:** Mu Sheng's forces were attacked again at Đan Xá on the Red River, suffering more heavy losses.\n\nFaced with these successive defeats, a shattered command structure, and the terrifying prospect of suffering the same fate as Liu Sheng, Mu Sheng ordered a hasty and disorganized retreat back to Yunnan, during which his army was continually harried by the Vietnamese. This failure to relieve Dongguan and the subsequent panicked retreat constituted his first and only major defeat during the Lam Sơn uprising.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the modern location of these battles.**\nThe key battle sites, Lãnh Câu Pass and Đan Xá, were strategically located along the Lô River and Red River, north of their confluence. Historical and geographical mapping places these events within the territory of modern-day Vietnam.\n*   The area encompassing the confluence of the Red River, Lô River, and Đà River, which was the strategic heart of this military operation, is the location of the modern city of Việt Trì.\n*   Việt Trì is the provincial capital of **Phú Thọ Province**. The battlefields of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá are located within the borders of this province, just upstream from the main river confluence.\n\nTherefore, the current Vietnamese province where the decisive events of Mu Sheng's defeat occurred is Phú Thọ.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
