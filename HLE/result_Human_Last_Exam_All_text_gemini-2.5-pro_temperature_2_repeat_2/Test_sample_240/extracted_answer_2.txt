The inability to see a resonance in a functional MRI coil with a VNA and loop probe is almost always due to a lack of magnetic coupling between the probe and the coil's resonant elements. The most common reasons for this are:
1.  **RF Shielding:** Many coils, especially volume coils, have a conductive RF shield built into their housing. The probe, being outside the shield, is intentionally isolated from the internal resonant circuit's magnetic field.
2.  **Active Detuning State:** Receive-only coils have active detuning circuits (using PIN diodes) to protect them during the transmit phase. When not connected to the MRI scanner, the coil is typically in a "detuned" state by default (no DC bias), meaning its resonance is shifted far away from the operating frequency.
3.  **Field Geometry and Probe Position:** The probe may be placed in a "null" of the coil's magnetic field, where the field lines do not link with the probe, resulting in no induced signal.
4.  **Phased Array Complexity:** In a multi-element phased array coil, elements are designed to be decoupled. Probing one small area may not excite the coil's main resonant mode or reflect its overall behavior.
The coil is functional in its intended environment (inside the MRI system), where it is properly powered, controlled, and positioned relative to the subject, but these conditions are not replicated by a simple bench test.
