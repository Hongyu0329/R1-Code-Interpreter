    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific painting:\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Subject:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Created after his escape/release from the Gestapo.\n*   **Specific Detail:** The object he holds in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and identify the specific painting.**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the famous painting titled **\"Selbstbildnis mit Distel\"** in German. This translates to **\"Self-Portrait with Thistle\"**. This is the artwork in question.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the context of the painting.**\nIn 1933, Curt Querner, who was a member of the Communist Party and whose art was associated with the \"New Objectivity\" movement, was arrested by the Nazi Gestapo. The Nazi regime later classified his work as \"degenerate art.\" This self-portrait was painted shortly after his release, making it a powerful personal and political statement.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the object held by the artist in the portrait.**\nLooking at the painting \"Self-Portrait with Thistle,\" Curt Querner is depicted holding a large **thistle plant** in his right hand.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the symbolism of the object.**\nA thistle is a plant known for being prickly, resilient, and able to grow in difficult, unhospitable environments. These characteristics make it a powerful symbol.\n*   **Resilience and Defiance:** Like the thistle that survives and thrives in harsh conditions, Querner portrays himself as unbroken and defiant in the face of persecution by the Nazi regime.\n*   **Painful Struggle:** The act of holding a thorny thistle plant also suggests that the struggle for resistance is difficult and painful, yet he holds it with determination.\n*   **Connection to the Land:** As a painter who often depicted rural life, the thistle also connects him to the German soil, reclaiming a piece of his homeland from the ideology that had imprisoned him.\n\nTherefore, the object he holds, the thistle, serves as a direct symbol of his steadfastness, resilience, and resistance against the oppression he had just experienced.\n\n<<<A thistle plant>>>"
