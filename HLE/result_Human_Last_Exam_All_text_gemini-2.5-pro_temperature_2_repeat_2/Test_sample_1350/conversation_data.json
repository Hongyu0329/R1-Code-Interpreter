    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks to identify a specific character from William Morris's novel *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must have visited a Roman city and later described a religious practice or story from that city that clearly alludes to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Elements of the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings*.\n    *   **Character's Action:** Visited a Roman city. This implies the character has a backstory involving travel or captivity outside the world of the Gothic tribe.\n    *   **Character's Report:** Described Roman religious practices. The character must narrate their observations to other characters in the story.\n    *   **Specific Content:** The description must contain elements of the Romulus and Remus myth (twin brothers, a she-wolf, founding a city).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Main Characters:**\n    *   **Thiodolf:** He is the chieftain of the Wolfings. While he leads the fight against the Romans, the narrative does not depict him having traveled to their cities and returning to describe their culture in this manner.\n    *   **Hall-Sun:** She is a supernatural being, a guardian of the house. Her knowledge is mystical and ancient, not based on anthropological observation of Roman cities.\n    *   **Thora:** She is Thiodolf's daughter and remains with the tribe. She has no firsthand experience of Roman cities.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Secondary Characters:**\n    *   The book features several secondary characters, but one, in particular, has a background that fits the criteria. This character is **Otter**, a thrall (a person in bondage, akin to a slave) of the Wolfing household.\n\n5.  **Focus on Otter's Backstory and Role:**\n    *   Otter is explicitly characterized as someone who has traveled far and has been a captive among the Romans. His role in the story is often to provide information about the outside world, particularly about the Romans, who are the tribe's antagonists.\n\n6.  **Locate the Specific Passage in the Novel:**\n    *   In Chapter VI, titled \"Otter tells of the Romans,\" the men of the Wolfings gather, and Otter is prompted to speak about the enemy.\n    *   During his narration, Otter describes a Roman city. He tells of its people, their armies, and their gods.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is in this chapter that he describes a key sight from one of their holy places. He speaks of a statue, a \"she-wolf of brass,\" and underneath it, two \"sucklings\" (infant boys), also made of brass. He then recounts the story the Romans tell about this statue: that the first fathers of their people were twin brothers, who were saved and suckled by a she-wolf after being abandoned as infants. These brothers then grew up to found the great city.\n\n7.  **Connect the Passage to the Question:**\n    *   Otter's description perfectly matches the elements required by the question. He is the character who visited a Roman city (as a captive). He describes a religious artifact (the statue) and the story behind it. The story of twin brothers nursed by a she-wolf is an unmistakable reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome. The \"she-wolf of brass\" is a direct allusion to the famous Capitoline Wolf statue.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the evidence within the text, Otter is the character who fulfills all the conditions laid out in the question.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
