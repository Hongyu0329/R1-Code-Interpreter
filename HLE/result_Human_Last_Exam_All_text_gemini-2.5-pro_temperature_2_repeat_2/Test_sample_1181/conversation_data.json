    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. This character must fit two criteria:\n    *   They miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n    *   They express a sense of shame or embarrassment about missing this simple, earthly phenomenon.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Characters and Themes:**\n    *   **Kris Kelvin (A):** He is the main character, a psychologist sent to the Solaris station. The film begins with him on Earth, surrounded by nature at his father's dacha. While he is the character most visually connected to the natural world of Earth, he is the recipient of the confession, not the one who makes it. He listens as another character expresses this feeling.\n    *   **Hari (B):** She is not a human but a \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created by the sentient Solaris ocean based on Kris's memories of his deceased wife. As a simulacrum, she has no authentic memories or experiences of Earth to miss. Her existence is confined to the space station and Kris's psyche.\n    *   **Dr. Snaut (C):** He is one of the scientists already on the station when Kris arrives. He is cybernetics specialist, often presented as weary, philosophical, and introspective. He serves as a guide for Kris, trying to explain the strange happenings. In a key scene in the station's library, Snaut has a long, philosophical conversation with Kris. It is during this exchange that he reflects on the futility of their mission and the human need for human connection. He confesses his own feelings of homesickness.\n    *   **Dr. Sartorius (D):** He is the other scientist, an astrobiologist. Sartorius is depicted as cold, clinical, and strictly dedicated to the scientific method. He views the \"visitors\" as mere objects of study and potential threats. Expressing shame over a sentimental feeling like missing leaves would be highly uncharacteristic of him.\n    *   **Gibarian (E):** He was the station's physiologist who committed suicide shortly before Kris's arrival. Kris only interacts with him through a recorded video message. In his message, Gibarian expresses despair and warns Kris, but he does not mention missing the rustling of leaves.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue:** The relevant scene takes place in the station's ornate library. Dr. Snaut and Kris are talking. Snaut delivers a monologue about humanity's flawed desire to conquer the cosmos, arguing that man only seeks a mirror of himself. After this philosophical discourse, his tone becomes more personal and confessional. He says words to the effect of: \"It might be shameful to admit it, but I... I miss... the rustling of leaves.\" This line perfectly matches the details in the questionâ€”the specific sound (rustling leaves) and the feeling associated with it (shame).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the direct dialogue from the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. This confession highlights the theme of alienation and the profound, almost-forgotten connection to Earth that haunts the characters isolated in space.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
