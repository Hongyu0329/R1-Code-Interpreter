    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph using randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Define the Graph\n\n*   **Barbell Graph with 10 nodes**: A barbell graph is formed by taking two complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge, known as a bridge or bottleneck. For a 10-node graph, the most symmetric and standard construction involves two 5-node complete graphs ($K_5$).\n    *   Let's call the two cliques $C_1$ and $C_2$. Both are $K_5$s.\n    *   Total number of nodes $N = 10$.\n*   **Bottleneck Edge**: This is the single edge connecting one node from $C_1$ to one node from $C_2$. Let's call the nodes at the ends of this edge $v_A$ (in $C_1$) and $v_B$ (in $C_2$). The bottleneck edge is $e_{b} = (v_A, v_B)$.\n*   **Randomized Uniform Gossiping**: This is a specific two-step edge sampling process:\n    1.  First, a node is chosen uniformly at random from all $N=10$ nodes to be the \"gossip initiator\". The probability of picking any specific node is $1/N = 1/10$.\n    2.  Second, the initiator node chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to send the gossip to. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor is $1/d(u)$, where $d(u)$ is the degree (number of neighbors) of the initiator node $u$.\n    The edge connecting the initiator and its chosen neighbor is the \"sampled edge\".\n*   **Goal**: We need to find the total probability that the sampled edge is the bottleneck edge, $e_b$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Degrees of the Nodes\n\nThe probability of sampling an edge depends on the degree of its endpoint nodes. We need to calculate the degree for each type of node in the barbell graph.\n\n*   **Bridge-head nodes ($v_A$ and $v_B$)**: These are the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Node $v_A$ is in a $K_5$, so it's connected to the other 4 nodes within its clique.\n    *   It is also connected to $v_B$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of $v_A$ is $d(v_A) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   By symmetry, the degree of $v_B$ is also $d(v_B) = 5$.\n*   **Internal clique nodes**: These are the nodes in the cliques that are not connected to the bridge.\n    *   In $C_1$, there are $5 - 1 = 4$ such nodes. Each is connected only to the other 4 nodes within its own $K_5$ clique.\n    *   Therefore, their degree is 4.\n    *   There are 8 such nodes in total (4 in $C_1$ and 4 in $C_2$).\n\n### Step 3: Identify Careful Points for Calculation\n\n1.  **Two Scenarios for Sampling**: The bottleneck edge $(v_A, v_B)$ can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    *   **Scenario 1**: The process starts by picking node $v_A$, and $v_A$ then picks neighbor $v_B$.\n    *   **Scenario 2**: The process starts by picking node $v_B$, and $v_B$ then picks neighbor $v_A$.\n2.  **Summing Probabilities**: The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios.\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Probability Calculation\n\nWe now calculate the probability for each scenario.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of Scenario 1 (starting from $v_A$):**\n    1.  The probability of choosing $v_A$ as the initial gossiping node is $P(v_A) = 1/10$.\n    2.  Given that $v_A$ is the initiator, it must choose a neighbor. The degree of $v_A$ is 5. Since it chooses a neighbor uniformly, the probability of it choosing $v_B$ is $P(v_A \\to v_B) = 1/d(v_A) = 1/5$.\n    3.  The combined probability of Scenario 1 is the product of these two probabilities:\n        $P(\\text{Scenario 1}) = P(v_A) \\times P(v_A \\to v_B) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of Scenario 2 (starting from $v_B$):**\n    1.  The probability of choosing $v_B$ as the initial gossiping node is $P(v_B) = 1/10$.\n    2.  Given that $v_B$ is the initiator, its degree is also 5. The probability of it choosing $v_A$ is $P(v_B \\to v_A) = 1/d(v_B) = 1/5$.\n    3.  The combined probability of Scenario 2 is:\n        $P(\\text{Scenario 2}) = P(v_B) \\times P(v_B \\to v_A) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Calculate the Final Total Probability:**\n    To get the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge, we add the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n    $P(\\text{bottleneck sampled}) = P(\\text{Scenario 1}) + P(\\text{Scenario 2})$\n    $P(\\text{bottleneck sampled}) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is $1/25$, or $0.04$.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
