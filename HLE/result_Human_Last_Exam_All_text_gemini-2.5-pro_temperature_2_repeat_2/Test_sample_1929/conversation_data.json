    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   Reactant 1 is **butadiene** (specifically, 1,3-butadiene), which has the structure CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene.\n    *   Reactant 2 is **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**, which has the structure CCl₂=CF₂. This is a substituted alkene, which can act as a dienophile.\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Form the Product Ring Skeleton:**\n    *   In a Diels-Alder reaction, the four carbons of the diene and the two carbons of the dienophile combine to form a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   Let's number the carbons of butadiene C1 through C4 (CH₂=C¹H-C²H=C⁴H₂).\n    *   Let's label the carbons of the dienophile as C(a) (the CCl₂ carbon) and C(b) (the CF₂ carbon).\n    *   New single bonds form between the ends of the diene (C1 and C4) and the carbons of the dienophile's double bond (C(a) and C(b)). Specifically, one new bond forms between C1 and C(a), and another between C4 and C(b) (or vice-versa).\n    *   The double bond between C2 and C3 of the diene is retained as a double bond in the new ring. The other double bonds are consumed. The bond between C(a) and C(b) becomes a single bond.\n    *   The resulting ring skeleton consists of the atoms arranged in the sequence: -C1-C2=C3-C4-C(b)-C(a)- (with a bond closing the ring between C(a) and C1).\n\n3.  **Consider Regioselectivity:**\n    *   The diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetric.\n    *   The dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) is unsymmetric because one carbon is bonded to two chlorine atoms and the other to two fluorine atoms.\n    *   This means two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers) can be formed:\n        *   **Product A:** C1 of butadiene bonds to C(a) (CCl₂) and C4 bonds to C(b) (CF₂).\n        *   **Product B:** C1 of butadiene bonds to C(b) (CF₂) and C4 bonds to C(a) (CCl₂).\n    *   The major product is determined by electronic effects, explained by Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory. The reaction proceeds through the interaction of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile.\n    *   The reaction is favored when the atoms with the largest orbital coefficients on the HOMO and LUMO align.\n    *   The HOMO of symmetric butadiene has orbital coefficients of equal magnitude at the terminal carbons (C1 and C4).\n    *   For the dienophile, the LUMO's orbital coefficients are unequal. The electron-withdrawing groups (F and Cl) lower the LUMO energy. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, making the CF₂ group more electron-withdrawing than the CCl₂ group. Consequently, the carbon of the CF₂ group is more electron-deficient and has the larger LUMO coefficient.\n    *   Therefore, the preferred alignment is between a terminal carbon of the diene and the CF₂ carbon of the dienophile. This leads to the formation of **Product B** as the major product.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Major Product:**\n    *   The major product is formed by making new bonds between C1(butadiene) and C(CF₂) and between C4(butadiene) and C(CCl₂).\n    *   The product is a six-membered ring (cyclohexene) with the following structure: The C(CF₂) group is attached to one of the -CH₂- carbons adjacent to the double bond, and the C(CCl₂) group is attached to the other -CH₂- carbon. The C(CF₂) and C(CCl₂) groups are adjacent to each other.\n    *   The resulting structure is:\n        ```\n             CH=CH\n            /      \\\n         CH₂      CH₂\n          \\      /\n           CF₂ -- CCl₂\n        ```\n        where the C1 of butadiene became the CH₂ bonded to CF₂ and the C4 of butadiene became the CH₂ bonded to CCl₂.\n\n5.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   The parent ring is a **cyclohexene**.\n    *   The double bond carbons are numbered C1 and C2. Numbering must give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the substituents.\n    *   There are two ways to number the double bond that could lead to different substituent numbers. Let's try them:\n        *   **Path 1:** Numbering clockwise so that the `CH₂` attached to `CF₂` is at position 3. This puts `CF₂` at position 4 and `CCl₂` at position 5. The locants are {4,4,5,5}. The name would be **5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene**.\n        *   **Path 2:** Numbering counter-clockwise so that the `CH₂` attached to `CCl₂` is at position 3. This puts `CCl₂` at position 4 and `CF₂` at position 5. The locants are {4,4,5,5}. The name would be **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n    *   Both numbering schemes yield the same set of locants {4,4,5,5}. According to IUPAC rules, when locant sets are identical, we choose the numbering that assigns the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   The substituents are \"chloro\" and \"fluoro\". \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically.\n    *   Path 2 assigns the locant '4' to the chloro groups, while Path 1 assigns '5'. Therefore, Path 2 is the correct numbering.\n\nThe product of the reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
