    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Core Problem**: The goal is to determine the equilibrium mean energy ($U$) and entropy ($S$) for a photon gas.\n2.  **Physical System**: The system is composed of light quanta (photons).\n    *   **Statistics**: Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\n    *   **Indistinguishability**: Photons are indistinguishable particles.\n    *   **Non-conservation of Particle Number**: A crucial property of a photon gas (like in a black-body cavity) is that photons can be created and absorbed by the walls. This means the total number of photons ($N$) is not conserved. In the language of statistical mechanics, this implies the chemical potential ($\\mu$) is zero.\n3.  **Theoretical Framework**: The question specifically requests using the **Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems**.\n    *   **Large Deviation Principle**: These theorems provide a formal mathematical foundation for a core principle of statistical mechanics: in the thermodynamic limit (large number of particles), the system is overwhelmingly likely to be found in its macrostate of maximum probability. Deviations from this state are exponentially unlikely.\n    *   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem relates the probability of an empirical distribution to the relative entropy (KL-divergence). Maximizing the probability of an empirical distribution (a macrostate) becomes equivalent to minimizing a rate function, which in this physical context is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy.\n    *   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem bounds the probability of the sum of random variables (like the total energy) deviating from its expected value. It justifies why macroscopic observables like energy density are sharply defined at their mean value in the thermodynamic limit.\n    *   **Practical Application**: In practice, using these theorems means applying the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**. We will find the equilibrium state by maximizing the entropy of the photon gas subject to its physical constraints.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**Step 1: Define the Entropy for a Bose Gas**\n\nThe statistical entropy (Boltzmann's formula) is $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the number of microstates for a given macrostate. For bosons, the number of ways to distribute $n_i$ particles into $g_i$ degenerate states at energy level $\\epsilon_i$ is $\\Omega_i = \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$. The total number of microstates is $\\Omega = \\prod_i \\Omega_i$.\n\nUsing Stirling's approximation ($\\ln N! \\approx N \\ln N - N$), the entropy becomes:\n$S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i \\right]$\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Maximum Entropy Principle**\n\nWe maximize this entropy $S$ subject to the constraints on the system.\n*   **Constraint 1: Fixed Mean Energy**: The total energy of the system is fixed at a value $U$.\n    $\\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i = U$\n*   **Constraint 2: No Particle Conservation**: As mentioned, $\\mu=0$, so there is no constraint on the total number of particles $\\sum_i n_i$.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S/k_B$ under the energy constraint. We want to maximize:\n$\\Phi = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left( \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i - U \\right)$\nSetting the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial n_j} = 0$ gives:\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j+g_j}{n_j}\\right) - \\beta\\epsilon_j = 0$\nSolving for the occupation number $n_j$, we find the equilibrium distribution:\n$\\langle n_j \\rangle = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nHere, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the Lagrange multiplier, which is identified with the inverse temperature. This is the **Planck distribution law**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nTo find the total energy, we must sum over all possible energy states. For photons in a 3D volume $V$, the energy spectrum is continuous. We replace the sum with an integral and $g_j$ with the density of states $g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon$.\nFor photons (which have two polarization states), the density of states is:\n$g(\\epsilon) = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2$\n\nThe mean energy $U$ is then:\n$U = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon$\n$U = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\nBy substituting $x = \\beta \\epsilon$, the integral becomes a standard form:\n$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$\nSubstituting this back, we get the equilibrium mean energy:\n$U = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nWe now substitute the equilibrium distribution $\\langle n_i \\rangle$ back into the entropy formula. A simpler path is to use the thermodynamic relation derived from the maximization:\n$S/k_B = \\beta U - \\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})$\nAgain, we convert the sum to an integral:\n$S/k_B = \\beta U - \\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\nThe integral can be solved using integration by parts, leading to the result:\n$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon = -\\frac{1}{3} \\beta U$\nTherefore, the entropy is:\n$S = k_B \\left( \\beta U - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3} \\beta U \\right) \\right) = k_B \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\beta U \\right) = \\frac{4U}{3T}$\n\nThis gives us a simple relation between entropy and mean energy. We can also write $S$ as an explicit function of temperature by substituting the expression for $U$:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3} \\right) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B (k_B T)^3}{45 (hc)^3}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy for a gas of light quanta (photons) in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$ are:\n\n**Mean Energy (U):**\n$U(T, V) = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\n\n**Entropy (S):**\n$S(T, V) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$\n\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the mean energy as:\n$S = \\frac{4U}{3T}$\n\n<<<**Mean Energy:** $U = \\frac{8\\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$, **Entropy:** $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$ (or $S = \\frac{4U}{3T}$)>>>"
