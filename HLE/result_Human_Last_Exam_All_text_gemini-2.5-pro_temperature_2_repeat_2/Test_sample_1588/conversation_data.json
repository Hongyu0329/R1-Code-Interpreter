    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for `Z` in `e^Z = e^X e^Y`, where `X` and `Y` are non-commuting variables (like matrices or operators). The solution `Z` is given as a series:\n`Z = log(e^X e^Y) = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 + ... + Z_n + ...`\n\nEach term `Z_n` is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree `n`. This means `Z_n` is a linear combination of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`, where the total number of `X`'s and `Y`'s in each commutator is `n`.\n\nFor example:\n*   `Z_1 = X + Y`\n*   `Z_2 = (1/2)[X, Y]`\n*   `Z_3 = (1/12)[X, [X, Y]] - (1/12)[Y, [X, Y]]`\n\nThe collection of all such Lie polynomials of a given degree `n` forms a vector space.\n\n### Step 2: Connecting Coefficients to the Free Lie Algebra\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This quantity is precisely the number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree 10 in the two generators `X` and `Y`. Any specific representation of `Z_{10}` will be a linear combination of the basis elements of this space. It's a known result that in a standard basis for these Lie polynomials (like the Hall or Lyndon basis), all the coefficients in the BCH expansion are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the dimension of the vector space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10 on two generators. This space is the 10th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, denoted `L_2(10)`.\n\n### Step 3: Using Witt's Formula\n\nThe dimension of the `n`-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on `k` generators is given by Witt's formula:\n\n`dim(L_k(n)) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(n/d) * k^d`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the degree of the polynomials (order). In this problem, `n = 10`.\n*   `k` is the number of generators. Here we have `X` and `Y`, so `k = 2`.\n*   The sum `Σ_{d|n}` is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nWe need to calculate `dim(L_2(10))`.\n\n1.  **Identify the parameters:**\n    *   `n = 10`\n    *   `k = 2`\n\n2.  **Find the divisors of `n=10`:**\n    The positive divisors `d` of 10 are {1, 2, 5, 10}.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Möbius function `μ(m)` for the required values:**\n    The Möbius function is defined as:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(m) = (-1)^r` if `m` is the product of `r` distinct primes.\n    *   `μ(m) = 0` if `m` has a squared prime factor.\n\n    We need `μ(10/d)` for each divisor `d`:\n    *   For `d = 1`: `μ(10/1) = μ(10)`. Since `10 = 2 * 5` (2 distinct primes), `μ(10) = (-1)^2 = 1`.\n    *   For `d = 2`: `μ(10/2) = μ(5)`. Since `5` is a prime (1 prime factor), `μ(5) = (-1)^1 = -1`.\n    *   For `d = 5`: `μ(10/5) = μ(2)`. Since `2` is a prime (1 prime factor), `μ(2) = (-1)^1 = -1`.\n    *   For `d = 10`: `μ(10/10) = μ(1)`. By definition, `μ(1) = 1`.\n\n4.  **Assemble the terms in Witt's formula:**\n    The formula is `dim(L_2(10)) = (1/10) * [ μ(10) * 2^1 + μ(5) * 2^2 + μ(2) * 2^5 + μ(1) * 2^10 ]`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the calculated values and compute the sum:**\n    *   `μ(10) * 2^1 = (1) * 2 = 2`\n    *   `μ(5) * 2^2 = (-1) * 4 = -4`\n    *   `μ(2) * 2^5 = (-1) * 32 = -32`\n    *   `μ(1) * 2^10 = (1) * 1024 = 1024`\n\n    Summing these terms:\n    `2 + (-4) + (-32) + 1024 = 2 - 4 - 32 + 1024 = 990`\n\n6.  **Complete the calculation:**\n    `dim(L_2(10)) = (1/10) * 990 = 99`\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is equal to the dimension of the space of Lie polynomials of degree 10 on two generators. By applying Witt's formula, we find this dimension to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
