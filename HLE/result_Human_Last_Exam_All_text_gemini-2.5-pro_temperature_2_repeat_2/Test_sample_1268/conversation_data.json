    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the upper bound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Components of the Question**\n    *   **Squarefree natural numbers (N):** These are positive integers not divisible by any perfect square other than 1 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10). In this context, N typically represents the level of a congruence subgroup.\n    *   **Congruence Subgroup:** For a given N, the relevant group is typically the congruence subgroup Γ₀(N), defined as:\n        Γ₀(N) = { $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ ∈ SL₂(ℤ) | c ≡ 0 (mod N) }\n    *   **Covolume (V):** This refers to the hyperbolic area of the fundamental domain of the group Γ₀(N), denoted as Area(Γ₀(N)\\ℍ). The upper half-plane ℍ is the space on which the group acts.\n    *   **Maximum norm (k_{k,∞}):** This term is interpreted as the maximum width of the cusps of the modular curve X₀(N) = Γ₀(N)\\ℍ*. The width of a cusp is a measure of the \"size\" of the cusp region in the fundamental domain.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Covolume (V)**\n    *   The covolume V is related to the index of Γ₀(N) in the full modular group SL₂(ℤ):\n        V = Area(Γ₀(N)\\ℍ) = (π/3) * [SL₂(ℤ) : Γ₀(N)]\n    *   For a squarefree integer N, the index of Γ₀(N) in SL₂(ℤ) is given by the formula:\n        [SL₂(ℤ) : Γ₀(N)] = N * Π_{p|N} (1 + 1/p), where the product is over the distinct prime factors of N.\n    *   This expression can be simplified using the sum-of-divisors function, σ(N) = Σ_{d|N} d. For a squarefree N, σ(N) is completely multiplicative over its prime factors, so:\n        N * Π_{p|N} (1 + 1/p) = N * Π_{p|N} ((p+1)/p) = Π_{p|N} (p+1) = σ(N).\n    *   Substituting this back into the formula for V, we get:\n        V = (π/3) * σ(N).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Maximum Norm (k_{k,∞})**\n    *   The cusps of Γ₀(N) can be represented by rational numbers. The width of a cusp associated with a fraction a/c (in lowest terms) is given by N / gcd(c², N).\n    *   For squarefree N, the cusps can be represented by s/d where d is a divisor of N and gcd(s, d)=1. The width of such a cusp is N/d.\n    *   The maximum width is obtained when the denominator d is minimized. The smallest divisor of any N≥1 is d=1.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum cusp width is N/1 = N. We identify this with the maximum norm:\n        k_{k,∞} = N.\n\n4.  **Establish the Relationship and Find the Upper Bound**\n    *   We have two key equations:\n        1.  k_{k,∞} = N\n        2.  V = (π/3) * σ(N)  =>  σ(N) = 3V/π\n    *   We need to find an upper bound for N in terms of V. To do this, we need a general inequality relating an integer N to its sum of divisors, σ(N).\n    *   For any integer N > 1, its set of divisors includes at least 1 and N.\n        *   If N is a prime number, its only divisors are 1 and N, so σ(N) = N + 1.\n        *   If N is a composite number, it has at least one other divisor d such that 1 < d < N. Thus, σ(N) ≥ N + 1 + d > N + 1.\n    *   Combining these cases, for any integer N > 1, we have the inequality:\n        σ(N) ≥ N + 1, which can be rearranged to N ≤ σ(N) - 1.\n    *   Now, we substitute the expression for σ(N) in terms of V into this inequality:\n        N ≤ (3V/π) - 1.\n    *   Since k_{k,∞} = N, we arrive at the final upper bound:\n        k_{k,∞} ≤ (3V/π) - 1.\n\n5.  **Careful Points and Verification**\n    *   **Assumption N > 1:** The inequality N ≤ σ(N) - 1 holds for all integers N > 1. It fails for N = 1 (since σ(1) = 1, leading to 1 ≤ 1 - 1 = 0, which is false). Therefore, the derived bound is valid for all squarefree N > 1. In the context of levels of modular forms, N=1 (corresponding to SL₂(ℤ)) is often treated as a trivial base case, so it's a standard practice to consider N > 1.\n    *   **Sharpness of the bound:** The bound is sharp. This means it cannot be improved. We can see this by considering the case where N is a prime number, p.\n        *   In this case, k_{k,∞} = p and σ(N) = σ(p) = p + 1.\n        *   The covolume is V = (π/3)(p + 1).\n        *   Substituting this V into the bound:\n            (3V/π) - 1 = (3/π) * [(π/3)(p + 1)] - 1 = (p + 1) - 1 = p.\n        *   So, for any prime N=p, we have k_{k,∞} = (3V/π) - 1. The bound is achieved with equality for an infinite sequence of cases (all primes), proving it is the best possible linear bound.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{k_{k,\\infty} \\le \\frac{3V}{\\pi}-1}$.\n\n<<<k_{k,∞} <= (3V/π) - 1>>>"
