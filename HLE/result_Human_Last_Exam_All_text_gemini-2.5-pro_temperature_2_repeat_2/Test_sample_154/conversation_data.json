    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Simple graph:** A graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of 5 distinct vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting structurally unique graphs. Two graphs are isomorphic if they can be rearranged to look identical.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A connected graph with 3 or more vertices that remains connected even after any single vertex is removed. This means the graph has no *articulation points* (or *cut vertices*).\n\n**Step 2: Establish Necessary Conditions**\n\nA key property of 2-vertex-connected graphs is related to their vertex degrees.\n*   **Minimum Degree Condition:** For a graph G with n > 2 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, the minimum degree of any vertex, denoted δ(G), must be at least 2 (i.e., δ(G) ≥ 2).\n    *   *Proof sketch:* If there were a vertex 'v' with degree 1, its only neighbor 'u' would be an articulation point (removing 'u' would disconnect 'v' from the rest of the graph). If there were an isolated vertex (degree 0), the graph would be disconnected.\n\nThis condition significantly narrows down the search space. We only need to consider graphs where every vertex has at least two edges.\n\n**Step 3: Systematic Enumeration by Number of Edges (m)**\n\nWe will systematically check graphs based on their number of edges, looking for those that satisfy the δ(G) ≥ 2 condition and then verifying their 2-connectivity.\n\n*   **m < 5:** The sum of degrees is 2m. With 5 vertices, if m < 5 (i.e., sum of degrees < 10), it's impossible for all 5 vertices to have a degree of at least 2. Therefore, no graph with fewer than 5 edges can be 2-vertex-connected on 5 vertices.\n\n*   **m = 5:**\n    *   The only way to have 5 vertices, 5 edges, and a minimum degree of 2 is if every vertex has a degree of exactly 2 (a 2-regular graph). The only simple, nonisomorphic, 2-regular graph on 5 vertices is the **5-cycle (C5)**.\n    *   **Is C5 2-vertex-connected?** Yes. Removing any single vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **m = 6:**\n    *   We need to add one edge to a graph with minimum degree 2. The simplest base is C5. Adding one edge (a \"chord\") to C5 connects two non-adjacent vertices. Due to the symmetry of C5, it doesn't matter which two non-adjacent vertices are chosen; the resulting graph is always the same up to isomorphism. This graph is **C5 with one chord**.\n    *   **Is C5 + chord 2-vertex-connected?** Yes. It contains a spanning C5, and adding edges to a 2-connected graph cannot make it less connected.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **m = 7:**\n    *   We can start with C5 and add two chords. There are three structurally different ways to add two chords:\n        1.  The two chords share a vertex (e.g., C5 + edges (v1,v3) and (v1,v4)). This is one unique graph. It is 2-connected as it contains a C5.\n        2.  The two chords do not share a vertex and \"cross\" (e.g., C5 + edges (v1,v3) and (v2,v4)). This is a second unique graph. It is 2-connected.\n        3.  The two chords do not share a vertex and do not \"cross\" (e.g., C5 + edges (v1,v3) and (v2,v5)). Analysis shows this graph is isomorphic to the \"crossing chords\" case. So, these two types result in only one nonisomorphic graph.\n    *   We must also consider graphs that are not formed by adding chords to a C5. Such a graph would not have a cycle passing through all 5 vertices (a Hamiltonian cycle). There is exactly one such graph with 5 vertices, 7 edges, and minimum degree 2: the **complete graph K5 minus the edges of a triangle (K5 - C3)**. We must check if it's 2-connected. Removing any vertex leaves a connected subgraph. Yes, it is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 3** (C5+2 incident chords, C5+2 non-incident chords, and K5-C3)\n\n*   **m = 8:**\n    *   We can analyze these as the complements of graphs with 2 edges (m' = C(5,2) - 8 = 2). A graph with 2 edges on 5 vertices is either two adjacent edges (P3) or two disjoint edges (2P2).\n        1.  **K5 - P3:** The complement of a path of length 2 (P3) with two isolated vertices. This graph is 2-connected.\n        2.  **K5 - 2P2:** The complement of two disjoint edges (2P2) with one isolated vertex. This is isomorphic to the Wheel graph W5 (a central vertex connected to a C4). It is 2-connected.\n    *   These two graphs have different degree sequences, so they are nonisomorphic.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **m = 9:**\n    *   The complement has 1 edge (m' = 10 - 9 = 1). The graph is **K5 with one edge removed (K5 - e)**.\n    *   **Is K5 - e 2-vertex-connected?** Yes. It is actually 3-connected. Removing any vertex leaves a K4, which is connected.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **m = 10:**\n    *   The only graph is the **complete graph K5**.\n    *   **Is K5 2-vertex-connected?** Yes. It is 4-connected.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n**Step 4: Final Tally**\n\nLet's sum the number of graphs found for each valid number of edges:\n*   m = 5: 1 graph (C5)\n*   m = 6: 1 graph (C5 + chord)\n*   m = 7: 3 graphs\n*   m = 8: 2 graphs\n*   m = 9: 1 graph (K5 - e)\n*   m = 10: 1 graph (K5)\n\nTotal number = 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9.\n\nThere are 9 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n<<<9>>>"
