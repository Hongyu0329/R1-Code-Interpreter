    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The absolute configurations (1S, 2R) for a 1,2-disubstituted compound indicate that the two substituents (bromo and methyl) are on opposite faces of the ring, meaning they are *trans* to each other.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol. KOtBu is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** A secondary alkyl halide reacting with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction mechanism. Substitution reactions (SN1/SN2) are disfavored.\n\n2.  **Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism is a concerted, one-step process.\n    *   It requires a specific geometry known as an **anti-periplanar** arrangement between the leaving group (Bromine) and a proton on an adjacent carbon (a beta-proton).\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar requirement means that both the leaving group and the beta-proton must be in **axial** positions. They must also be trans to each other (one pointing \"up\" and the other \"down\").\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conformations of the Substrate:**\n    *   As a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane can exist in two interconverting chair conformations:\n        *   **Conformation A (diequatorial):** Both the bromine and the methyl group are in equatorial positions. This is the more stable conformation because bulky groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position.\n        *   **Conformation B (diaxial):** Both the bromine and the methyl group are in axial positions. This is the less stable conformation due to significant 1,3-diaxial steric interactions.\n    *   The molecule will predominantly exist as the more stable diequatorial conformer (Conformation A).\n\n4.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation:**\n    *   For the E2 reaction to occur, the leaving group (Br) must be in an axial position.\n    *   In Conformation A (diequatorial), the Br is equatorial. Therefore, **Conformation A cannot undergo the E2 reaction**.\n    *   The molecule must flip into the less stable diaxial conformation (Conformation B) for the reaction to happen. Although this conformer is present in a low concentration at equilibrium, the reaction proceeds through it according to the Curtin-Hammett principle.\n\n5.  **Identify Available Beta-Protons in the Reactive Conformation (Conformation B):**\n    *   In the reactive diaxial conformer, the bromine is axial. Let's assume it is axial-down. Since the methyl group is *trans* to the bromine, it must be on the opposite face, so it will be axial-up.\n    *   We now look for axial protons on the beta-carbons (C2 and C6). An axial-down Br requires an axial-up beta-proton for elimination.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial-up position. This means the proton on C2 is in the equatorial position. There is **no axial proton** on C2.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two protons. One is in the axial-up position, and the other is in the equatorial-down position. There is an **axial proton** on C6 that is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n\n6.  **Predict the Product:**\n    *   Since elimination is only possible via removal of the axial proton on C6, the base (tert-butoxide) will abstract this specific proton.\n    *   A double bond will form between C1 and C6. The methyl group on C2 is not involved and remains in its position.\n    *   This result is an example of stereoelectronic control, where the geometry required for the reaction mechanism dictates the product. The thermodynamically more stable Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene, a trisubstituted alkene) cannot form because there is no anti-periplanar proton on C2. Instead, the less substituted \"Hofmann-like\" product (a disubstituted alkene) is formed exclusively.\n\n7.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group.\n    *   To name it according to IUPAC rules, we number the carbons of the ring starting with the double bond as C1 and C2 to give the substituents the lowest possible number.\n    *   Numbering the double bond carbons as 1 and 2, the methyl group is located on carbon 3.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Reaction Identification:** Recognize that strong, bulky bases with secondary halides favor E2.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Correctly identify that (1S,2R) on a 1,2-substituted ring means the groups are *trans*.\n*   **Conformational Analysis:** Understand that trans-1,2 can be diaxial or diequatorial, and that the diequatorial is more stable but unreactive for E2.\n*   **E2 Requirement:** The most critical point is the strict anti-periplanar (diaxial) requirement for E2 on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Product Determination:** The product is dictated by which beta-proton meets the stereochemical requirement, not by Zaitsev's or Hofmann's rules of regioselectivity in this case. The rules are overridden by stereoelectronics.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature:** Correctly number the final alkene product to arrive at its proper name.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe reaction is an E2 elimination. It proceeds through the unstable diaxial conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. In this conformation, the axial Br on C1 is anti-periplanar only to the axial H on C6, not to any H on C2 (which has an axial methyl group). Therefore, elimination occurs exclusively to form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
