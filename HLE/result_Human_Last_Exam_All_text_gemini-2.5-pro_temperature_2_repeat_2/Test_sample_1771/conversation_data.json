    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb form `*seh₂gieti` into its reflexes in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`. This root means 'to track, seek out'. The presence of the `*h₂` (a-coloring laryngeal) is confirmed by cognates like Latin `sāgīre`.\n*   **Suffix:** `*-ie/o-`. This is a present tense suffix, often used to form causative or stative verbs. The meaning provided, '(s)he's giving a sign', fits a causative sense ('to cause to know/perceive').\n*   **Ending:** `*-ti`. This is the 3rd person singular present indicative active ending.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\nWe apply the systematic sound changes that occurred as PIE evolved into Proto-Germanic.\n\n1.  **Vocalism:** The PIE sequence `*eh₂` (short `e` followed by the `h₂` laryngeal) regularly develops into a long `*ā` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   PIE `*seh₂g-` → PGmc `*sāg-`\n\n2.  **Consonantism (Grimm's Law):** The PIE voiceless stops shift to voiceless fricatives, voiced stops shift to voiceless stops, and voiced aspirated stops shift to voiced stops/fricatives.\n    *   PIE `*s-` remains `*s-` at the beginning of a word.\n    *   PIE `*g` (a voiced velar stop) shifts to `*k` (a voiceless velar stop).\n    *   Therefore, PGmc `*sāg-` → PGmc `*sāk-`.\n\n3.  **Verb Formation:** The PIE `*-ie/o-` suffix regularly forms a Class I weak verb in Proto-Germanic, with the infinitive suffix `*-janą`.\n    *   The PIE 3rd person singular ending `*-ti` develops into PGmc `*-þi` (which is often cited as `*-þ`). The connecting vowel `i` is part of the Class I weak verb inflection.\n\n4.  **Final Proto-Germanic Form:**\n    *   Combining the root `*sāk-` with the Class I weak verb ending gives us the 3rd person singular present form.\n    *   **Proto-Germanic: `*sākiþ`** (from `*sāk-i-þi`) meaning '(s)he makes known' or '(s)he informs'. (Note: The commonly known Germanic verb for 'to seek', `*sōkijaną`, comes from the `o`-grade of the same root, `*soh₂g-`, which is not what was asked).\n\n### Step 3: Derivation into Old Norse (ON)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The `*-j-` (or the following `-i-` in the inflection) of the Class I weak verb triggers a process called i-umlaut, where the back root vowel `*ā` is fronted.\n    *   PGmc `*ā` ([ɑː]) fronted by i-umlaut becomes Old Norse `æ` ([ɛː]).\n    *   So, the stem `*sāk-` becomes `sæk-`.\n\n2.  **Ending:** The PGmc 3rd person singular ending `*-iþ` becomes `-ir` in Old Norse for weak verbs.\n\n3.  **Final Old Norse Form:**\n    *   Combining the umlauted stem `sæk-` with the ending `-ir`.\n    *   **Old Norse: `sækir`**.\n\n### Step 4: Derivation into Old English (OE)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** Similar to Old Norse, the `i/j` triggers i-umlaut on the root vowel.\n    *   PGmc `*ā` fronted by i-umlaut becomes Old English `ǣ` ([æː]).\n    *   The stem `*sāk-` becomes `sǣc-`.\n\n2.  **Palatalization:** In Old English, the velar consonant `*k` is palatalized to `ċ` ([tʃ], like 'ch' in 'church') when it comes before a front vowel like the newly formed `ǣ`.\n    *   The stem `sǣc-` becomes `sǣċ-`.\n\n3.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-eþ` or `-þ` in Old English (the `i` is lost).\n\n4.  **Final Old English Form:**\n    *   Combining the umlauted and palatalized stem `sǣċ-` with the ending `-þ`.\n    *   **Old English: `sǣċþ`**.\n\n### Step 5: Derivation into Old High German (OHG)\n\n1.  **High German Consonant Shift:** This major sound change affects consonants differently than in other Germanic languages.\n    *   `*s-` remains `s-`.\n    *   `*k` following a long vowel (`*ā`) is shifted to a voiceless fricative `hh` ([x], like 'ch' in German 'Bach').\n    *   The ending `*-þ` shifts to `-t` in this position (after the vowel `i`).\n    *   So, PGmc `*sākiþ` → `sāhit`.\n\n2.  **I-Umlaut:** I-umlaut also occurs in OHG, but it happens later and is not always represented in the spelling of the oldest texts. If it were shown, the `ā` would umlaut to `æ` (written `ae`, `e`), but the non-umlauted spelling reflects the earlier state.\n    *   Stem `*sāk-` becomes `sāh-`.\n\n3.  **Ending:** The 3rd person singular present ending for this class is `-it`.\n\n4.  **Final Old High German Form:**\n    *   Combining the shifted stem `sāh-` with the ending `-it`.\n    *   **Old High German: `sāhit`**.\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sākiþ`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sækir`\n*   **Old English:** `sǣċþ`\n*   **Old High German:** `sāhit`\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *sākiþ; **Old Norse:** sækir; **Old English:** sǣċþ; **Old High German:** sāhit>>>"
