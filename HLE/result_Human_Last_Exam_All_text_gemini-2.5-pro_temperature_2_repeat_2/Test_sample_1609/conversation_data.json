    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(4), where a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function mapping inputs from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to an output in $\\{0, 1\\}$. For $n=4$, the inputs are 4-bit binary numbers (e.g., 0000 to 1111).\n*   **Implicant:** A product term (AND of literals like $x_1x_2'x_3$) which implies the function. This means if the implicant evaluates to 1, the function's output must also be 1.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that is \"maximal\". If you remove any literal from a prime implicant, the resulting product term is no longer an implicant of the function. For example, if $x_1x_2$ is a PI, then neither $x_1$ nor $x_2$ by themselves are implicants of the function.\n*   **a(n):** We are looking for a single Boolean function of $n$ variables that has the highest possible number of PIs. This number is a(n). We need to find a(4).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze for small values of n**\n\n*   **a(1):** For one variable, $x$, the possible PIs are $x$ and $x'$. A function can be $f(x)=x$ (1 PI), $f(x)=x'$ (1 PI), $f(x)=1$ (1 PI, which is the term '1'), or $f(x)=0$ (0 PIs). The maximum is 1. So, a(1) = 1.\n*   **a(2):** For two variables, $x_1, x_2$, we can construct a function represented by a \"checkerboard\" pattern on a Karnaugh map. For instance, the function $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1'x_2' + x_1x_2$. The two minterms are not adjacent and cannot be combined, so they are both prime implicants. Thus, this function has 2 PIs. It can be shown that no 2-variable function has more than 2 PIs. So, a(2) = 2.\n*   **a(3):** For three variables, one might guess the checkerboard pattern (parity function) is optimal. The function $f$ which is true for inputs with an odd number of 1s has minterms {1, 2, 4, 7}. On a K-map, none of these are adjacent, so the function has 4 PIs (the minterms themselves). However, a different function can be constructed with more PIs. For example, the function with ON-set {1,2,3,4,5,6} has 6 prime implicants ($x_1'x_2, x_1'x_3, x_2x_3', x_1x_3', x_1x_2', x_2'x_3$). Therefore, a(3) is at least 6. The accepted value is a(3) = 6.\n\n**Step 3: Finding a(4) using established results**\n\nThis is a well-known and non-trivial problem in switching theory. The values of a(n) are known for small n from research papers by scientists like Igarashi, Chandra, and Markowsky. The sequence is known as A000375 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nWhile there is some historical disagreement in the literature for certain values of n (like a(3) and a(5)), there is a strong consensus for a(4). The result is supported by a formula derived from this research.\n\nThe formula for a(n), which is exact for small n including n=4, is:\n$a(n) = \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{j}$\nwhere $k = \\lfloor \\frac{2n+1}{3} \\rfloor$ and $j = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate a(4) using the formula**\n\n1.  Set n = 4.\n2.  Calculate the parameter k:\n    $k = \\lfloor \\frac{2 \\times 4 + 1}{3} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{9}{3} \\rfloor = 3$\n3.  Calculate the parameter j:\n    $j = \\lfloor \\frac{4}{3} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.333... \\rfloor = 1$\n4.  Substitute these values back into the formula for a(4):\n    $a(4) = \\binom{4}{k} \\binom{k}{j} = \\binom{4}{3} \\binom{3}{1}$\n5.  Evaluate the combinations:\n    *   $\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4$\n    *   $\\binom{3}{1} = \\frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = \\frac{3!}{1!2!} = 3$\n6.  Multiply the results:\n    $a(4) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$\n\nThe maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables is 12."
