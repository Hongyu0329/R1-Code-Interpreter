    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question and define the terms\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set $X$ equipped with a distance function $d(x,y)$ that satisfies the standard metric axioms plus the strong triangle inequality: $d(x,z) \\le \\max(d(x,y), d(y,z))$ for all $x,y,z \\in X$.\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete normed vector space. The norm induces a metric $d_B(u,v) = \\|u-v\\|$. The cardinality of the set of points in $B$ is given as $K$. Standard examples of Banach spaces are over the fields $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. If $B$ is not the trivial space $\\{0\\}$, its cardinality is at least that of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. If $B = \\{0\\}$, its cardinality is $K=1$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A map $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding if it preserves distances, i.e., for all $x, y \\in X$, $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d_X(x, y)$.\n*   **The Goal:** We want to find the \"smallest possible number\" of such isometric embeddings. This phrasing implies that we can choose the space $X$ (from the class of finite ultrametric spaces) and the space $B$ (from the class of Banach spaces of a given cardinality $K$) in order to minimize the number of these embeddings. The number of embeddings is a non-negative integer.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the minimization problem\nLet $\\mathcal{X}$ be the class of all finite ultrametric spaces. Let $\\mathcal{B}_K$ be the class of all Banach spaces with cardinality $K$. We are looking for the value:\n$$ N = \\min_{X \\in \\mathcal{X}, B \\in \\mathcal{B}_K} |\\mathcal{E}(X, B)| $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{E}(X, B)$ is the set of all isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$. Since the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, the smallest it could possibly be is 0.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate if the number of embeddings can be 0\nTo see if 0 is an attainable value, we need to determine if there exists at least one pair $(X,B)$ (satisfying the given conditions) for which there are no isometric embeddings.\nLet's try to construct such a pair.\n\n1.  **Choose a Banach Space B:** Let's pick a simple, common Banach space. Let $B = \\mathbb{R}$ with its standard norm (the absolute value). $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Banach space, and its cardinality is $K = \\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n2.  **Choose a Finite Ultrametric Space X:** Let's consider a simple space. Let $X$ be a set with three points, $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$. Let's define a metric on $X$ by setting $d(p_i, p_j) = 1$ whenever $i \\neq j$, and $d(p_i, p_i)=0$. This type of metric space, where all distinct points are equidistant, is called an equilateral set.\n    Let's check if this space is ultrametric. The strong triangle inequality is $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$. For any distinct points $p_i, p_j, p_k$ in $X$, this inequality becomes $1 \\le \\max(1, 1)$, which is true. Therefore, this $X$ is a finite ultrametric space.\n\n3.  **Count the Isometric Embeddings:** We now count the number of isometric embeddings $f: X \\to B$, i.e., from our 3-point space $X$ to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    An isometric embedding would require finding three points in $\\mathbb{R}$, let's call them $y_1 = f(p_1)$, $y_2 = f(p_2)$, and $y_3 = f(p_3)$, such that the distance between any two of them is 1. That is, we must have:\n    *   $|y_1 - y_2| = 1$\n    *   $|y_1 - y_3| = 1$\n    *   $|y_2 - y_3| = 1$\n\n4.  **Analyze the existence of such points:** Let's assume such points exist and order them on the real line: $y_1 < y_2 < y_3$.\n    *   From $|y_2 - y_1| = 1$ and their ordering, we get $y_2 - y_1 = 1$.\n    *   From $|y_3 - y_2| = 1$ and their ordering, we get $y_3 - y_2 = 1$.\n    *   Now, let's find the distance between $y_1$ and $y_3$:\n        $y_3 - y_1 = (y_3 - y_2) + (y_2 - y_1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   So, the distance is $|y_3 - y_1| = 2$.\n    *   However, the condition for an isometric embedding requires that this distance be 1. We have a contradiction: $2 = 1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion for this case:** The contradiction shows that it's impossible to find three such points on the real line. Therefore, there are no isometric embeddings from our chosen space $X$ to our chosen space $B = \\mathbb{R}$. The number of embeddings for this pair $(X,B)$ is 0.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nWe have found a valid choice of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ (of cardinality $K=\\mathfrak{c}$) for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is indeed 0.\n\nThis argument can be generalized. For any given Banach space $B$, one can often find a finite (ultrametric) space $X$ that cannot be isometrically embedded into it. For instance, for any Banach space $B$, there is a limit on the size of an equilateral set that can be embedded in it. By choosing an equilateral space $X$ larger than this limit, we ensure there are 0 embeddings. For example, for $B=\\{0\\}$ (with $K=1$), any $X$ with at least two points cannot be embedded.\n\nTherefore, we can always construct a situation with zero embeddings."
