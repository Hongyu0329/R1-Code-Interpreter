    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n### Step 1: Syllabification and Elision\n\nFirst, we must divide the line into syllables and check for elisions. An elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or '-m' is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or 'h'.\n\n*   Line: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n*   `bene` ends in `-e` and `esse` begins with `e-`. This is a clear case of elision. The final `-e` of `bene` is dropped.\n*   The line is therefore pronounced and scanned as: `et tibi bÃ¨n'esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n*   The syllabified line becomes: `et | ti | bi | es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\n*   There are 13 syllables to be arranged into 6 metrical feet. This indicates that some feet will have more than the standard two syllables.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Meter\n\nThe line is an **iambic senarius**, a common meter in Roman comedy (like that of Plautus, from whom this line is taken). This meter consists of six iambic feet. The basic pattern is an iamb (S L), but substitutions are very common.\n\n*   Ideal Pattern: S L | S L | S L | S L | S L | S L\n*   Common Substitutions: Spondee (L L), Anapest (S S L), Dactyl (L S S), Tribrach (S S S), Trochee (L S).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Each Syllable's Quantity\n\nWe determine whether each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on the rules of Latin prosody.\n\n*   **et**: The vowel `e` is naturally short. However, it is followed by two consonants: the `t` at the end of `et` and the `t` at the beginning of `tibi`. This makes the syllable long by position.\n    *   `et` = **L**\n*   **ti**-bi: The vowel `i` is naturally short and is followed by a single consonant.\n    *   `ti-` = **S**\n*   -**bi**: The vowel `i` is naturally short and is followed by the elided vowel.\n    *   `-bi` = **S**\n*   **es**-se: The vowel `e` is naturally short but is followed by the double consonant `-ss-`. This makes the syllable long by position.\n    *   `es-` = **L**\n*   -**se**: The vowel `e` is naturally short and is followed by a single consonant.\n    *   `-se` = **S**\n*   **so**-li: The `o` in `solus` (from which `soli` derives) is naturally long.\n    *   `so-` = **L**\n*   -**li**: The `i` at the end of the dative `soli` is short.\n    *   `-li` = **S**\n*   **quom**: This is a single-syllable word. Its vowel `o` is followed by two consonants: the `m` in `quom` and the `s` in `sibi`. This makes the syllable long by position.\n    *   `quom` = **L**\n*   **si**-bi: The first `i` in `sibi` is naturally short.\n    *   `si-` = **S**\n*   -**bi**: The second `i` in `sibi` is also naturally short.\n    *   `-bi` = **S**\n*   **sit**: The vowel `i` is naturally short. However, it is followed by two consonants: the `t` at the end of `sit` and the `m` at the beginning of `male`. This makes the syllable long by position.\n    *   `sit` = **L**\n*   **ma**-le: The `a` in `male` is naturally short.\n    *   `ma-` = **S**\n*   -**le**: The final syllable of a line can be treated as long regardless of its natural quantity. This principle is called *brevis in longo* (\"a short syllable in a long position\"). Therefore, the final short `-e` scans as long.\n    *   `-le` = **L**\n\n### Step 4: Assembling the Feet\n\nNow we group the syllables into six feet according to the iambic senarius meter.\n\n*   **Foot 1**: `et ti` -> **L S** (This is a Trochee, a common substitution in the first foot).\n*   **Foot 2**: `bi es` -> **S L** (A standard Iamb. Note the `es` comes from `esse` after the elision of `bene`).\n*   **Foot 3**: `se so` -> **S L** (A standard Iamb).\n*   **Foot 4**: `li quom` -> **S L** (A standard Iamb).\n*   **Foot 5**: `sibi sit` -> **S S L** (This is an Anapest, a very common substitution for an iamb).\n*   **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> **S L** (A standard Iamb, which is the required pattern for the final foot).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the feet gives the complete scansion of the line.\n\n<<<L S S L S L S L S S L S L>>>"
