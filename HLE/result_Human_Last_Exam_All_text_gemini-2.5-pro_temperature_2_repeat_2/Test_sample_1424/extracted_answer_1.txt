The bare Green's function, $G_0(k, \omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ as it determines the location of the pole in the Green's function. The mathematical expression for the retarded Green's function is $G_0^R(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - (\epsilon_k - \mu) + i\eta}$, showing that $G_0$ has a simple pole at the complex energy $\omega = \epsilon_k - \mu - i\eta$. In essence, the single-particle energies constitute the pole structure of the non-interacting propagator.
