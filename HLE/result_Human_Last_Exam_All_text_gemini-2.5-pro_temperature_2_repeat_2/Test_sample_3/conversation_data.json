    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nThe goal is to find the largest possible integer $|G|$ where $G$ is a subgroup of the group of rational points of an elliptic curve $E$ over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, i.e., $G \\subseteq E(K)_{tors}$, and $G$ must be non-cyclic. $E(K)_{tors}$ is the torsion subgroup of the Mordell-Weil group $E(K)$.\n\n### Step 2: Recall the Structure of Torsion Subgroups over Number Fields\nThe structure of the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$, is a finite abelian group. It can be written in the form $\\mathbb{Z}/N_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/N_2\\mathbb{Z}$ for unique integers $N_1, N_2$ with $N_1 | N_2$. The group is non-cyclic if and only if $N_1 > 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Utilize the Classification Theorem for Quadratic Fields\nThe possible structures for torsion subgroups $E(K)_{tors}$ where $K$ is a quadratic number field ($[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$) have been completely classified. The question is specifically about the non-cyclic possibilities. According to the theorem (due to the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose), the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over a quadratic field are:\n1.  $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n2.  $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n3.  $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n4.  $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$\n5.  $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Orders of These Possible Non-Cyclic Groups\nTo find the largest possible order, we compute the order (number of elements) for each group in the classification list.\n1.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$: The order is $4N$.\n    *   $N=1$: Order is 4\n    *   $N=2$: Order is 8\n    *   $N=3$: Order is 12\n    *   $N=4$: Order is 16\n    *   $N=5$: Order is 20\n    *   $N=6$: Order is 24\n2.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$: The order is $9N$.\n    *   $N=1$: Order is 9\n    *   $N=2$: Order is 18\n3.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$: The order is $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n4.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$: The order is $5 \\times 5 = 25$.\n5.  For $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$: The order is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Maximum Possible Order\nBy inspecting the orders calculated in the previous step, we can find the maximum:\n$\\max(\\{4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24\\}, \\{9, 18\\}, \\{16\\}, \\{25\\}, \\{36\\}) = 36$.\nThis shows that the largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over any quadratic field is 36.\n\n### Step 6: Verify if the Maximum Order is Attainable over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nThe final crucial step is to determine if this maximal order can be achieved for an elliptic curve defined specifically over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The group corresponding to the maximal order 36 is $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFurther results in the classification theory provide more specific information about which fields can support these large torsion structures:\n*   An elliptic curve can have a torsion subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 25) over a quadratic field $K$ if and only if $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$.\n*   An elliptic curve can have a torsion subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 36) over a quadratic field $K$ if and only if $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 7: Final Conclusion\nSince the non-cyclic torsion group with the largest possible order over any quadratic field, $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 36), is realized specifically over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, it follows that the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 36. While other smaller non-cyclic groups might also exist over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ (for instance, $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$), their orders (9 and 18, respectively) are smaller than 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
