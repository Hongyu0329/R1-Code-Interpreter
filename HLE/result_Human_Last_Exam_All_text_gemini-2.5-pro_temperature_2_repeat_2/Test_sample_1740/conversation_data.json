    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of human let-7 family members.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of identified members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family in humans to date. This requires consulting an authoritative source for miRNA annotations and understanding what constitutes a \"family member.\"\n\n**Step 2: Define \"let-7 family member\"**\nIn the context of miRNAs, a \"family\" is a group of miRNAs that share a common \"seed sequence\" â€” a short, conserved sequence of nucleotides that is critical for binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Members of the let-7 family all share a highly conserved seed sequence. A \"member\" typically refers to a distinct mature miRNA sequence, even if multiple genes (precursors) can produce the same mature miRNA.\n\n**Step 3: Consult an Authoritative Database (miRBase)**\nThe primary repository for all published miRNA sequences and annotations is miRBase. To get the most accurate and up-to-date count, we need to list the human (designated by the prefix \"hsa-\") miRNAs that belong to the let-7 family according to miRBase and the broader scientific consensus.\n\n**Step 4: List the Canonical let-7 Family Members in Humans**\nBased on miRBase and established literature, the human let-7 family includes the following distinct mature miRNAs:\n\n*   **let-7a**\n*   **let-7b**\n*   **let-7c**\n*   **let-7d**\n*   **let-7e**\n*   **let-7f**\n*   **let-7g**\n*   **let-7i**\n\n**Step 5: Identify Related and Excluded Members (Careful Points)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Inclusion of miR-98:** Due to its identical seed sequence and high overall sequence homology, **miR-98** is considered a member of the let-7 family. Therefore, it must be included in the count.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Exclusion of let-7h:** A sequence once annotated as hsa-let-7h has since been **removed** from miRBase for humans. It was determined that the sequence was actually part of a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and not a true miRNA. Therefore, let-7h is not counted as a member in humans.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Distinguishing between Genes and Members:** The question asks for the number of *members*, which refers to the distinct types (let-7a, let-7b, etc.), not the number of genes that produce them. For example, the mature let-7a miRNA is produced from three different precursor genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3), but it is counted as a single family member. Similarly, let-7f is produced by two genes. Counting the precursor genes would result in a higher number (12), but this is not the standard way to count family members.\n\n**Step 6: Final Count**\nLet's assemble the final list of distinct members of the human let-7 family:\n\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n9.  miR-98\n\nCounting the items in this definitive list gives a total of 9 members.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis considering inclusions, exclusions, and the definition of a family member, there are 9 identified members of the let-7 family in humans.\n\n<<<9>>>"
