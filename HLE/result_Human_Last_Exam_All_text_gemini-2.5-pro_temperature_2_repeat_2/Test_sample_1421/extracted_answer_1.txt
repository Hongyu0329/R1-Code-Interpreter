The formula for the fermionic partition function $Z$ is given by the functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$:
$Z = \int \mathcal{D}[\bar{\psi}] \mathcal{D}[\psi] \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$
where $S_E$ is the Euclidean action, $S_E = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d x \, \mathcal{L}_E$, and the integral is performed over all fields that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time, $\tau$: $\psi(\mathbf{x}, \beta) = -\psi(\mathbf{x}, 0)$.
