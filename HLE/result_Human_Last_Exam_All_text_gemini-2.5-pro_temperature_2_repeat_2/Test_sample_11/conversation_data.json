    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The key components of the question are:\n    *   **\"First statute\"**: We are looking for the chronologically earliest law.\n    *   **\"in the modern State of Israel\"**: This means a law passed by the Knesset after its establishment in 1949, not a law inherited from the British Mandate or Ottoman period (even if it remained in force).\n    *   **\"explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must use the specific term \"good faith\" (Hebrew: תום לב, *tom lev*). A law implying fairness or equity without using the explicit term would not qualify.\n    *   **\"the concept of 'good faith'\"**: The term must be used as a substantive legal concept, creating a condition, a defense, or a standard of conduct.\n\n2.  **Identify Major Candidates**: Several key Israeli laws are famous for their use of the \"good faith\" principle. We must examine them in chronological order.\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**: This is the most well-known statute for establishing \"good faith\" as a fundamental, overarching principle in Israeli private law. Section 12 mandates good faith in negotiations, and Section 39 mandates good faith in the performance of contractual obligations. Due to its profound impact, it is often thought of as the law that introduced the concept. However, we must check if any earlier statutes used the term.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969**: This major piece of legislation predates the Contracts Law. It explicitly uses the term \"good faith.\" For instance, Section 9, which deals with conflicting transactions, protects a purchaser who acted \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*). This is an explicit use of the concept in a statute from 1969. This means the Contracts Law of 1973 cannot be the first.\n    *   **Defamation Law, 1965**: This statute predates both the Land Law and the Contracts Law. Section 15 of this law lists a series of defenses to a defamation claim, and Section 16(a) states that to rely on these defenses, the defendant must have made the publication \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*). This is a clear, explicit, and substantive introduction of the concept of good faith as a legal requirement in a Knesset statute.\n\n3.  **Compare the Candidates and Final Conclusion**:\n    *   We have identified at least three laws that explicitly use the concept of \"good faith\".\n    *   Chronologically, the **Defamation Law** was enacted in **1965**.\n    *   The **Land Law** was enacted in **1969**.\n    *   The **Contracts (General Part) Law** was enacted in **1973**.\n    *   Therefore, based on the timeline, the first of these to explicitly introduce the concept into an original Israeli statute was the Defamation Law.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"First Use\" vs. \"Broadest Application\"**: It is crucial to distinguish between the first statute to ever use the term \"good faith\" and the statute that established it as a general, guiding principle of private law. While the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, is celebrated for the latter, the question asks for the *first* statute, making the chronological date the decisive factor.\n*   **Inherited vs. Original Law**: The question specifies a statute \"in the modern State of Israel.\" This correctly leads the search to laws passed by the Knesset, rather than pre-state legislation like the Bills of Exchange Ordinance (a Mandate-era law that also uses the concept of a \"holder in good faith\").\n*   **Explicit Terminology**: The analysis must focus on the explicit words \"good faith\" (*tom lev*), not on related but distinct concepts like \"fairness,\" \"equity,\" or \"customary manner.\" The Defamation Law of 1965 satisfies this requirement perfectly.\n\nBy following this step-by-step analysis, we can confidently identify the Defamation Law of 1965 as the correct answer.\n\n<<<Defamation Law>>>"
