    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{2^{n-1}} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The size of the group in the question is 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we have $n=9$.\n    So, the group is $G = SD_{2^9}$. Its presentation is:\n    *   $a^{2^{9-1}} = a^{256} = 1$\n    *   $b^2 = 1$\n    *   $bab = a^{2^{9-2}-1} = a^{128-1} = a^{127}$\n    The group $G$ has order 512. It is a 2-group (a p-group with p=2).\n\n*   **Power Subgroups:** A \"power subgroup\" of a group G is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some positive integer $k$. The question asks for the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 2: Utilize the properties of p-groups**\n\nA crucial theorem for p-groups states that the set of all power subgroups is the same as the set of its Agemo subgroups.\nFor a p-group $G$, the set of power subgroups $\\{ G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\}$ is equal to the set $\\{ G^{p^i} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{N}_0 \\}$, where $\\mathbb{N}_0 = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots \\}$.\nThe subgroup $G^{p^i}$ is also denoted as $\\mho_i(G)$.\n\nSince our group $G = SD_{2^9}$ is a 2-group (p=2), its power subgroups are the subgroups in the sequence:\n$\\mho_0(G) = G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$\n$\\mho_1(G) = G^{2^1} = G^2$\n$\\mho_2(G) = G^{2^2} = G^4$\n... and so on.\n\nThis forms a descending chain of subgroups: $G \\supseteq G^2 \\supseteq G^4 \\supseteq \\dots$\nTo find the number of distinct power subgroups, we need to find all the distinct members of this chain. The chain will eventually become the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Agemo subgroups for $SD_{2^9}$**\n\nThe elements of $G=SD_{2^9}$ are of the form $a^k$ (for $0 \\le k < 256$) and $a^k b$ (for $0 \\le k < 256$). We need to compute the subgroups generated by the powers of these elements.\n\n*   **$\\mho_0(G) = G^{1} = G = SD_{512}$**: This is the group itself, with order 512. This is the first power subgroup.\n\n*   **$\\mho_1(G) = G^2 = \\langle g^2 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$**:\n    We need to compute the squares of all elements in $G$.\n    *   For elements of the form $a^k$: $(a^k)^2 = a^{2k}$. The subgroup generated by all these elements is $\\langle a^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements of the form $a^k b$: We first find $(a^k b)^2 = a^k b a^k b = a^k (bab^{-1})^k b^2 = a^k (a^{127})^k = a^k a^{127k} = a^{128k}$.\n        - If $k$ is even, $k=2m$, then $a^{128k} = a^{128(2m)} = a^{256m} = 1$.\n        - If $k$ is odd, $k=2m+1$, then $a^{128k} = a^{128(2m+1)} = a^{256m}a^{128} = a^{128}$.\n    So, $G^2 = \\langle \\{a^{2k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}, \\{1, a^{128}\\} \\rangle = \\langle \\langle a^2 \\rangle, a^{128} \\rangle$.\n    Since $a^{128} = (a^2)^{64}$, the element $a^{128}$ is already in $\\langle a^2 \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, $\\mho_1(G) = \\langle a^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/2 = 128$. This is a new subgroup, distinct from $G$.\n\n*   **$\\mho_2(G) = G^4 = \\langle g^4 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$**:\n    *   For elements of the form $a^k$: $(a^k)^4 = a^{4k}$. These generate $\\langle a^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements of the form $a^k b$: $(a^k b)^4 = ((a^k b)^2)^2 = (a^{128k})^2 = a^{256k} = 1$. These only contribute the identity element.\n    Therefore, $\\mho_2(G) = \\langle a^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/4 = 64$. This is distinct from the previous subgroups.\n\n*   **$\\mho_i(G) = G^{2^i}$ for $i \\ge 2$**:\n    The calculation for $\\mho_2(G)$ can be generalized.\n    *   $(a^k)^{2^i}$ generates $\\langle a^{2^i} \\rangle$.\n    *   $(a^k b)^{2^i} = ((a^k b)^2)^{2^{i-1}} = (a^{128k})^{2^{i-1}}$. Since $a^{128}$ has order 2, this is 1 for $i-1 \\ge 1$ (i.e., $i \\ge 2$).\n    So for any $i \\ge 2$, $\\mho_i(G) = \\langle a^{2^i} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct subgroups in the chain**\n\nWe have the following chain of power subgroups:\n1.  $\\mho_0(G) = G = SD_{512}$ (order 512)\n2.  $\\mho_1(G) = \\langle a^2 \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 128)\n3.  $\\mho_2(G) = \\langle a^4 \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 64)\n4.  $\\mho_3(G) = \\langle a^8 \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 32)\n5.  $\\mho_4(G) = \\langle a^{16} \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 16)\n6.  $\\mho_5(G) = \\langle a^{32} \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 8)\n7.  $\\mho_6(G) = \\langle a^{64} \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 4)\n8.  $\\mho_7(G) = \\langle a^{128} \\rangle$ (cyclic, order 2)\n9.  $\\mho_8(G) = \\langle a^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nFor any $i \\ge 8$, $\\mho_i(G)$ will also be the trivial subgroup, so no new subgroups are formed. All the subgroups listed above are distinct since they have different orders.\n\nCounting the distinct subgroups in the list, we find there are 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe final count of the distinct power subgroups is the length of this chain of Agemo subgroups until it reaches the trivial subgroup. This gives us 9 distinct subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
