    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core anatomical feature in the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific feature on the skull of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. The feature is the \"lacrimal recess\", and the question wants to know how many smaller \"depressions\" this recess contains.\n\n*   **Organism:** *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid theropod dinosaur.\n*   **Anatomical bone:** Lacrimal bone (part of the skull, located in front of the eye socket).\n*   **Specific feature:** Lacrimal recess (a fossa or large depression on the surface of the lacrimal bone).\n*   **Question:** The number of smaller depressions *within* the lacrimal recess.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the primary scientific source for the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*.**\nTo answer such a specific paleontological question, it is essential to consult the primary scientific literature that describes the fossil. The most comprehensive description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull (holotype specimen SMNS 58022) is in the 2002 monograph by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott titled, \"*Irritator challengeri*, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n\n**Step 3: Find the description of the lacrimal bone within the scientific paper.**\nIn the Sues et al. (2002) paper, there is a dedicated section describing the lacrimal bone. This section provides the detailed anatomical information needed to answer the question.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the description of the lacrimal recess and its contents.**\nThe paper describes the lacrimal bone as having a deeply excavated lacrimal recess on its outer surface. The key sentence for answering the question is a direct description of what is inside this recess. It states:\n\n*\"The floor of this recess is pierced by three large, pneumatically-generated foramina arranged in a vertical row.\"*\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The term \"foramina\" means openings or holes. In this context, these openings are the most prominent features, or depressions, located within the larger lacrimal recess.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The paper specifies the number of these features precisely as \"three.\"\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The description does not mention any other distinct depressions or pits within the recess, making these three foramina the features in question.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the information to form a final answer.**\nBased on the most authoritative scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, the lacrimal recess is a large depression that itself contains three smaller, distinct features described as foramina (openings/depressions). Therefore, the number of depressions contained within the lacrimal recess is three.\n\n<<<3>>>"
