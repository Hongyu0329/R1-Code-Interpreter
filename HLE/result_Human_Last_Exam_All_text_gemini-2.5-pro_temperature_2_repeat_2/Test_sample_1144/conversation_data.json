    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) when it is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n*   The uncertainty in its position ($\\Delta x$) is 10 pm.\n\n**3. List Necessary Concepts and Formulas**\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle connects the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) with the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$). For minimum uncertainty, the relation is:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant ($\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$).\n\n*   **Bohr Model for the Hydrogen Atom:** This model is used to determine the momentum ($p$) of the electron. A key postulate of the Bohr model is the quantization of angular momentum ($L$):\n    $L = n \\hbar$\n    where $n$ is the principal quantum number. Angular momentum is also defined as $L = r \\cdot p$, where $r$ is the orbital radius and $p$ is the linear momentum.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step A: Find an expression for the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\n    From the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n*   **Step B: Find an expression for the momentum ($p$) of the electron.**\n    According to the Bohr model, for the first orbit, $n=1$. The angular momentum is:\n    $L = 1 \\cdot \\hbar = \\hbar$\n    Since $L = r \\cdot p$, for the first orbit, this becomes $L = r_1 \\cdot p_1$, where $r_1$ is the radius of the first orbit (also known as the Bohr radius, $a_0$) and $p_1$ is the momentum in that orbit.\n    So, $\\hbar = r_1 \\cdot p_1$.\n    Solving for momentum, we get:\n    $p_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\n    Now, we form the ratio using the expressions from Step A and Step B:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1} \\right)}$\n    The reduced Planck's constant $\\hbar$ cancels out, which simplifies the calculation significantly:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n*   **Step D: Substitute the known values and calculate the final answer.**\n    We need the values for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$.\n    *   $r_1$ (Bohr radius) $\\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11}$ m.\n    *   $\\Delta x$ (given) = 10 pm. We must convert this to meters:\n        $10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n    Now substitute these values into the simplified ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{5.29}{2}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = 2.645$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Units:** Ensure all quantities are in SI units (meters, in this case) before performing the final calculation. The given position uncertainty was in picometers (pm) and needed to be converted.\n2.  **Formulas:** Use the correct formula for the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ($\\hbar/2$, not $h/4\\pi$ or other variations, although they are equivalent). For the Bohr model, remember the quantization of angular momentum.\n3.  **Simplification:** By deriving the ratio in terms of symbols first ($\\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$), we simplified the problem and avoided calculating intermediate values for $\\Delta p$ and $p$, which reduces the chance of rounding errors.\n4.  **Conceptual Paradox:** This problem mixes two different physical models: the semi-classical Bohr model with its defined orbits, and the fully quantum Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that such perfectly defined orbits cannot exist. You are expected to use the formulas from both models as requested by the question. The large result (2.645) signifies that the uncertainty in momentum is more than twice the momentum itself, which underscores why the concept of a classical orbit is invalid at this scale.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
