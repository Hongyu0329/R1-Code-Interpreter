    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Playing Area**\nThe goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no bishop can attack another. We then need to find how many edge squares are left empty.\n\nThe \"edge squares\" are all the squares on the first and eighth ranks, and the 'a' and 'h' files.\nAn 8x8 board has 8 squares per side. To find the total number of unique edge squares, we can calculate (8 * 4 sides) - 4 corners (which are counted twice) = 32 - 4 = 28.\nSo, there are 28 edge squares in total.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Properties of Bishops**\nA crucial property of bishops is that they always stay on squares of the same color. A bishop on a light square can only attack other pieces on light squares, and a bishop on a dark square can only attack other pieces on dark squares.\nThis means we can solve the problem for the two colors independently and then combine the results. The total maximum number of bishops will be the maximum number we can place on the light edge squares plus the maximum number we can place on the dark edge squares.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Edge Squares by Color**\nThe 28 edge squares are divided perfectly equally by color. There are 14 light-colored edge squares and 14 dark-colored edge squares. Due to the symmetry of the board, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the light squares will be the same as the maximum number we can place on the dark squares. Let's find this number for one color.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Maximum Bishops on Dark Edge Squares**\nThe 14 dark edge squares are: a1, c1, e1, g1, a3, a5, a7, b8, d8, f8, h8, h2, h4, h6.\n\nWe need to place bishops on these squares so that no two are on the same diagonal. Let's identify the diagonals that connect these squares:\n*   **Attack Chain 1:** c1 attacks a3, which in turn attacks f8, which in turn attacks h6. This forms a chain of 4 squares: `c1-a3-f8-h6`.\n*   **Attack Chain 2:** e1 attacks a5, which attacks d8, which attacks h4. This forms another chain of 4 squares: `e1-a5-d8-h4`.\n*   **Attack Chain 3:** g1 attacks a7, which attacks b8, which attacks h2. This forms a third chain of 4 squares: `g1-a7-b8-h2`.\n*   **Attack Chain 4:** a1 attacks h8. This forms a chain of 2 squares: `a1-h8`.\n\nThese four chains account for all 14 dark edge squares (4+4+4+2=14). To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops within a chain, we must select squares that are not adjacent in the chain. For a chain of `n` squares, the maximum number of bishops we can place is `ceiling(n/2)`.\n\n*   Chain 1 (n=4): Max bishops = ceiling(4/2) = 2. (e.g., place on c1 and f8)\n*   Chain 2 (n=4): Max bishops = ceiling(4/2) = 2. (e.g., place on e1 and d8)\n*   Chain 3 (n=4): Max bishops = ceiling(4/2) = 2. (e.g., place on g1 and b8)\n*   Chain 4 (n=2): Max bishops = ceiling(2/2) = 1. (e.g., place on a1)\n\nThe total maximum number of bishops on the dark edge squares is 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Total Maximum Number of Bishops**\nBy symmetry, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 light edge squares is also 7.\nTherefore, the total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on all 28 edge squares is 7 (dark) + 7 (light) = 14 bishops.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe problem asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed = 14\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total Squares - Placed Bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nIf the players succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, 14 bishops would be placed.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of edge squares that would lack bishops is 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
