    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Reaction:** The synthesis of xenon tetrafluoride involves the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) gas and fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    Xe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\n2.  **Understand the Factors Affecting Synthesis:** The product of the reaction between xenon and fluorine is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions, specifically:\n    *   **Temperature:** Provides the necessary activation energy for the reaction to occur at a practical rate. The temperature also influences which xenon fluoride is predominantly formed.\n    *   **Pressure:** Affects the concentration of the gaseous reactants.\n    *   **Molar Ratio of Reactants (Xe:F2):** Different ratios favor the formation of different products (XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Conditions for XeF4 Synthesis:**\n    *   To produce Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), the most common and efficient method involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine.\n    *   The typical molar ratio used is approximately 1 part xenon to 5 parts fluorine (a significant excess of fluorine compared to the 1:2 stoichiometric ratio).\n    *   The reaction is carried out in a sealed vessel, usually made of nickel or Monel (which are resistant to fluorine gas), at an elevated pressure (around 6 atmospheres).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Role of Temperature and Efficiency:**\n    *   The term \"efficiently\" implies a method that produces a good yield of the desired product in a reasonable amount of time.\n    *   The reaction between xenon and fluorine has a high activation energy, meaning it requires a significant energy input to get started. Therefore, very low temperatures are not feasible.\n    *   **At temperatures that are too low (e.g., 200 °C or below):** The reaction rate is extremely slow. While a minuscule amount of product might form over a very long period, this process would not be considered \"efficient.\" The reactants would mostly remain unreacted.\n    *   **At the optimal temperature:** The standard, well-established temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF4 is approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, there is a good balance between a high reaction rate and the stability of the XeF4 product.\n    *   **At temperatures that are too high (e.g., 600 °C):** While the reaction rate is high, the excess energy and fluorine favor the formation of the more highly fluorinated product, xenon hexafluoride (XeF6). So, at 600 °C, the synthesis is not efficient for producing XeF4.\n\n5.  **Examine the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is too high and favors the production of XeF6, not XeF4.\n    *   **B. 400 C:** This is the textbook temperature for the efficient laboratory and industrial synthesis of XeF4.\n    *   **C. 200 C:** This temperature is generally too low for the reaction to proceed at an efficient rate.\n    *   **D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary activation energy for a practical synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, 400 °C is the established optimal temperature for efficiently producing XeF4. While some reaction may occur at slightly lower temperatures, it would be inefficient. Among the given choices, 400 °C represents the coldest temperature at which the synthesis can be carried out efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
