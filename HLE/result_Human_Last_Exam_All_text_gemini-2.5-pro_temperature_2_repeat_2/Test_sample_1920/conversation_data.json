    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the conductor and the character\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization of the Conductor:**\n    First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n    By testing small prime divisors:\n    $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n    $7657 = 13 \\times 589$\n    $589 = 19 \\times 31$\n    So, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n    Since $d$ is a product of distinct primes (i.e., it is square-free), this simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of the Character:**\n    A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n    $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_1$ is a character mod 7, $\\chi_2$ is a character mod 13, $\\chi_3$ is a character mod 19, and $\\chi_4$ is a character mod 31.\n\n3.  **Condition for a Primitive Character:**\n    For a square-free conductor $d$, the character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo its respective prime $p_i$.\n    A character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (the character that is 1 for all inputs coprime to $p$). The principal character is the only character of order 1. Thus, for each $\\chi_i$ to be primitive, its order must be greater than 1.\n\n4.  **Order of the Character:**\n    The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\n    We are looking for characters of order 6.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible orders of the component characters\n\nLet $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We require that $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$. This implies two conditions:\n1.  For each $i$, $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be primitive, its order $k_i$ must be greater than 1. Therefore, the possible orders for each $k_i$ are {2, 3, 6}.\n2.  For the lcm to be 6, there must be at least one component character whose order is a multiple of 2 (i.e., 2 or 6), and at least one whose order is a multiple of 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\nThe number of characters of a specific order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n\nLet's check this condition for our primes:\n-   $\\phi(7) = 6$. The orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 6.\n-   $\\phi(13) = 12$. The orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 12.\n-   $\\phi(19) = 18$. The orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 18.\n-   $\\phi(31) = 30$. The orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 30.\n\nSo, for each component character, the order can indeed be 2, 3, or 6.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of choices for each component character\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$, we count the number of primitive characters with orders in {2, 3, 6}.\n-   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n-   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n-   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nThe counts are the same for each of the four prime moduli.\n\n### Step 4: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the final count\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), ..., \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))=6$.\n\nLet's apply the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n1.  **Total combinations where orders divide 6:**\n    First, we count the total number of ways to choose primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that the order of each character divides 6. This means the order of each $\\chi_i$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n    For each prime $p_i$, the number of available characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are four such component characters, the total number of combinations is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n2.  **Combinations to exclude:**\n    This total of 625 includes cases where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3). We must subtract these.\n    -   **Case A: lcm divides 3.** This occurs if the order of every component character $\\chi_i$ divides 3. Since the characters are primitive, their order must be 3.\n        The number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3) = 2$ for each prime factor.\n        The number of such combinations is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$. The lcm for these combinations is 3.\n    -   **Case B: lcm divides 2.** This occurs if the order of every component character $\\chi_i$ divides 2. Since the characters are primitive, their order must be 2.\n        The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2) = 1$ for each prime factor.\n        The number of such combinations is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$. The lcm for this combination is 2.\n    -   **Case C: lcm divides 1.** This requires the order of each component to be 1. This is not possible as primitive characters must have an order greater than 1. So, the count is 0.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The number of characters with order exactly 6 is the total number of combinations where orders divide 6, minus the number of combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6.\n    The set of combinations where the lcm divides 2 and the set where the lcm divides 3 are disjoint (their intersection would require the lcm to divide gcd(2,3)=1, which has 0 elements). So we can simply subtract their counts.\n\n    Number of characters = (Total where orders divide 6) - (Total where orders divide 3) - (Total where orders divide 2)\n    Number = $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$."
