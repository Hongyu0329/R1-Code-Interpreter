    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the verses that contain the names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Purpose:** The goal is to find the specific range of verses (*abyat*) in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem \"Aqeedat al-'Awaam\" that explicitly list the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an.\n\n2.  **Context within the Poem:** The poem is structured to teach the fundamentals of Islamic creed. The section on the Prophets (*an-Nubuwwat*) follows the section on God (*al-Ilahiyyat*). Within the section on the Prophets, the author first establishes the obligation to believe in them and their four essential attributes (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence).\n\n3.  **Locating the Prelude to the List:** Before listing the names, the author states that knowing the details of 25 of them is a requirement. This occurs in **Bayt 30**:\n    > تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ\n    > كُلٌّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    >\n    > *(The detailed mention of twenty-five is necessary;\n    > For every legally responsible person, so verify and seize this knowledge.)*\n\n4.  **Identifying the Starting Bayt:** The verse immediately following the one above begins the enumeration of the prophets' names. This is **Bayt 31**:\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ\n    > صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    >\n    > *(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with;\n    > Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.)*\n    This verse clearly marks the beginning of the list.\n\n5.  **Following the Sequence:** The names continue to be listed in the subsequent verses:\n    *   **Bayt 32:** Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n6.  **Identifying the Concluding Bayt:** The list of the 25 prophets concludes in the very next verse, ending with the name of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), referred to as \"Taha\" and \"the seal\" (*Khatim*). This is **Bayt 34**:\n    > إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n    > عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعِ الْغَيَّا\n    >\n    > *(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya;\n    > 'Isa and Taha, the Seal, leave misguidance.)*\n    This is the final verse that contains names from the list of 25 prophets. The verse that follows (Bayt 35) offers prayers upon them but does not add any new names to the list.\n\n7.  **Final Determination of the Range:** Based on the analysis, the listing of the prophets' names begins at Bayt 31 and concludes at Bayt 34.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** While the text of the poem is standard, verse numbering can sometimes vary slightly between different publications or manuscripts by one or two verses. However, the range identified (from the bayt starting with *Hum Adamun...* to the one ending with *...Taha Khatimun*) is consistent in its content and sequence. The 31-34 numbering is the most widely accepted one.\n*   **Context vs. List:** It is important to distinguish between the start of the *topic* of the prophets (which begins earlier, around Bayt 27) and the start of the specific *enumeration of their names* (which begins at Bayt 31). The question asks for the verses that contain the names.\n*   **\"Taha\":** In this context, \"Taha\" is a well-known title used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe names of the Prophets are mentioned from Bayt 31 to Bayt 34 in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam.\n\n<<<From Bayt 31 to Bayt 34.>>>"
