    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terminology\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements have a least upper bound (also called a join or supremum). We can view `J` as a small category where objects are the elements of `J`, and there is a unique morphism from `i` to `j` (denoted `i \\to j`) if and only if `i \\le j` in the partial order.\n*   **Functor `f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K`:** This is a representation of the poset `J`. It assigns a `K`-vector space `f(j)` to each element `j \\in J` and a linear map `f(i \\to j): f(i) \\to f(j)` to each relation `i \\le j`, in a way that respects composition (i.e., if `i \\le j \\le k`, the map for `i \\le k` is the composition of the maps for `i \\le j` and `j \\le k`). The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of left modules over the **incidence algebra** `K[J]`.\n*   **Tame Functor:** The term \"tame\" refers to the representation type of the underlying structure. The question \"a tame functor `f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K`\" is standard shorthand in representation theory for \"a functor `f` from the category `Fun(J, \\text{Vect}_K)`, where the poset `J` is of tame representation type\". A poset `J` (or its incidence algebra `K[J]`) is of tame type if, for any given dimension `d`, its indecomposable representations of dimension `d` can be classified and belong to a finite number of one-parameter families. This lies between finite type (finitely many indecomposables in total) and wild type (the classification problem is as hard as classifying pairs of matrices).\n*   **n-resolvable:** A functor (or module) `f` is said to be `n`-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most `n`. That is, there exists an exact sequence `0 \\to P_n \\to \\cdots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0`, where each `P_k` is a projective functor. This property is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of `f`, denoted `pd(f)`, is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Step 2: Rephrasing the Question\n\nThe question asks for the integer `n` such that *any* functor `f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K` is `n`-resolvable, given that `J` is an upper semilattice of tame representation type. This is equivalent to asking for an upper bound `n` on the projective dimension of any such functor `f`. The sharpest such `n` would be the supremum of the projective dimensions of all functors `f` over all tame upper semilattices `J`. This value is the supremum of the **global dimensions** of the incidence algebras `K[J]` for all `J` that are tame upper semilattices.\n\nSo, the question becomes: **What is the maximum possible global dimension of the incidence algebra `K[J]`, where `J` is a finite upper semilattice of tame representation type?**\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Homological Dimension\n\nThe global dimension of an algebra `A` is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all its modules. `gl.dim(A) = \\sup \\{pd(M) | M \\in \\text{Mod}_A\\}`. For an incidence algebra `K[J]`, it suffices to take the supremum over the simple modules `S_i` (where `S_i(j) = K` if `j=i` and `0` otherwise).\n\nLet's analyze some examples to find a candidate for `n`.\n\n*   **Case 1: `J` is a chain.** A chain is an upper semilattice. Its incidence algebra is hereditary and of finite representation type (a sub-case of tame). Hereditary algebras have global dimension at most 1. So here, `n=1`.\n*   **Case 2: `J` is V-shaped.** Let `J = \\{a, b, c\\}` with `a < c` and `b < c`. `J` is an upper semilattice (`a \\lor b = c`). Its incidence algebra is also hereditary and of finite representation type. `gl.dim(K[J]) = 1`.\n*   **Case 3: The diamond poset.** Let `J = \\{w, x, y, z\\}` with `w < x < z` and `w < y < z`. This is a lattice, and thus an upper semilattice. The representation type of `K[J]` is known to be tame (it corresponds to the extended Dynkin diagram `\\tilde{D}_4`). Let's calculate its global dimension. The simple module `S_z` corresponding to the unique maximal element `z` has a minimal projective resolution:\n    `0 \\to P_w \\to P_x \\oplus P_y \\to P_z \\to S_z \\to 0`.\n    Since this resolution has length 2 (`P_w, P_x \\oplus P_y, P_z`), we have `pd(S_z) = 2`. The other simple modules have projective dimensions 0 or 1. Thus, `gl.dim(K[J]) = 2`.\n\nThis example shows that `n` must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 4: Connecting Tameness, Upper Semilattices, and Global Dimension\n\nThe crucial part is to determine if the global dimension can exceed 2. We need to appeal to deeper results in representation theory.\n\n1.  **Exclusion of Wild Type:** A poset `J` is of wild representation type if it contains certain minimal wild posets as subposets. Many of these wild posets lead to incidence algebras of infinite global dimension. The \"tame\" condition explicitly forbids these, which suggests the global dimension should be finite. The upper semilattice property for `J` implies `gl.dim(K[J])` is finite.\n\n2.  **Known Classes of Tame Algebras:** The important classes of tame algebras that arise from posets are well-studied.\n    *   **Tilted Algebras:** Many tame incidence algebras are tilted algebras (specifically, tilted from hereditary algebras of Euclidean type). A key theorem by Happel states that tilted algebras have a global dimension of at most 2.\n    *   **Concealed Algebras:** The incidence algebra of the diamond poset is not tilted, but it is a \"tame concealed algebra\". These also have a global dimension of at most 2.\n    *   **Canonical Algebras:** Another major class of non-tilted tame algebras are the canonical algebras. The posets corresponding to canonical algebras are lattices (and thus upper semilattices). It is a known result that canonical algebras have a global dimension of exactly 2.\n\n3.  **Synthesis:** The combination of `J` being an upper semilattice and `K[J]` being of tame representation type is a very strong constraint. It forces `J` to avoid all wild subposets. The structures that remain and are of tame type fall into classes (like concealed or canonical) whose incidence algebras are known to have a global dimension of at most 2. While there exist tame algebras with global dimensions greater than 2, they do not appear to be constructible as incidence algebras of upper semilattices.\n\nThe evidence strongly points to the conclusion that if `J` is a tame upper semilattice, then `gl.dim(K[J]) \\le 2`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n*   We are looking for an integer `n` such that any functor `f` over a tame upper semilattice `J` has `pd(f) \\le n`.\n*   This is equivalent to finding `n = \\sup \\{ \\text{gl.dim}(K[J]) \\}` over all tame upper semilattices `J`.\n*   The example of the diamond poset shows that `n` must be at least 2.\n*   The theory of tame algebras, especially those arising from posets with strong structural properties like being an upper semilattice, indicates that the global dimension is bounded by 2.\n\nTherefore, the value of `n` is 2. Any such functor is 2-resolvable.\n\n<<<2>>>"
