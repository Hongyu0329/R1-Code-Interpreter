    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object**\n$X$ is a hypersurface in complex projective 3-space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5. Let the homogeneous coordinates of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ be $[Z_0:Z_1:Z_2:Z_3]$. Then $X = \\{[Z] \\in \\mathbb{CP}^3 \\mid F(Z_0, Z_1, Z_2, Z_3) = 0\\}$, where $F$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   **Dimension:** $X$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ has complex dimension 3, a single equation cuts the dimension by 1. Thus, $X$ is a complex surface (complex dimension 2). As a real manifold, its dimension is 4.\n*   **Smoothness:** The condition that $X$ is smooth means it is a complex manifold without singularities.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Low-Dimensional Homotopy and Homology of X**\nWe use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, which relates the topology of a submanifold to the ambient projective space.\n*   **Homotopy version:** For a smooth complex submanifold $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ of dimension $k$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms $i_*: \\pi_j(X) \\to \\pi_j(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $j < k$.\n    In our case, $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$ has dimension $k=2$. So, the inclusion induces isomorphisms on $\\pi_j$ for $j < 2$.\n    *   $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is simply connected for $n \\ge 1$, we have $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$. Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. $X$ is simply connected.\n    *   $\\pi_0(X) \\cong \\pi_0(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Both spaces are connected.\n*   **Homology consequences:** Since $X$ is simply connected, its first homology group is the abelianization of its fundamental group: $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)_{ab} = 0$. So the first Betti number $b_1(X) = 0$.\n*   Since $X$ is a compact, connected, orientable 4-manifold, it is path-connected ($b_0(X)=1$) and by PoincarÃ© duality, its top homology group is $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ ($b_4(X)=1$).\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Betti Numbers of X**\nWe can calculate the topological Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ of a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ using the formula:\n$\\chi(X_d) = d(d^2 - 4d + 6)$.\nFor our quintic surface ($d=5$):\n$\\chi(X) = 5(5^2 - 4 \\cdot 5 + 6) = 5(25 - 20 + 6) = 5(11) = 55$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic is also given by the alternating sum of Betti numbers:\n$\\chi(X) = b_0(X) - b_1(X) + b_2(X) - b_3(X) + b_4(X)$.\nUsing the known Betti numbers:\n$55 = 1 - 0 + b_2(X) - b_3(X) + 1 \\implies b_2(X) - b_3(X) = 53$.\n\nTo find $b_2(X)$ and $b_3(X)$ individually, we need more information. We can use Hodge theory. For a complex surface like $X$, we have $b_3(X) = h^{2,1}(X) + h^{1,2}(X)$. By Serre duality, $h^{p,q} = h^{n-p, n-q}$, where $n=2$ is the complex dimension. Thus $h^{2,1} = h^{0,1}$ and $h^{1,2} = h^{1,0}$. The number $q = h^{1,0}(X)$ is the irregularity. For any smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ ($n\\ge 2$), the irregularity $q=0$.\nTherefore, $h^{1,0}=h^{0,1}=h^{1,2}=h^{2,1}=0$, which implies $b_3(X) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $b_3(X)=0$ into our earlier equation:\n$b_2(X) - 0 = 53 \\implies b_2(X) = 53$.\n\nSummary of Betti numbers and relevant homology groups:\n*   $b_0=1$, $b_1=0$, $b_2=53$, $b_3=0$, $b_4=1$.\n*   Since $X$ is a smooth projective variety, its integer homology groups are torsion-free.\n*   $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$\n*   $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n**Step 4: Relate Homology to the Third Homotopy Group $\\pi_3(X)$**\nFor a simply connected, finite 4-dimensional CW complex (which $X$ is), there is a known short exact sequence relating its third homotopy group to its homology groups. This result stems from the work of J. H. C. Whitehead. The sequence is:\n$$0 \\to H_4(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\Gamma(H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z})) \\to 0$$\nHere, $\\Gamma(A)$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor. If $A$ is a free abelian group, then $\\Gamma(A)$ is also a free abelian group. The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ can be determined from this sequence.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**\nThe rank of a group in a short exact sequence $0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0$ satisfies $\\text{rank}(B) = \\text{rank}(A) + \\text{rank}(C)$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the kernel:** The kernel in the sequence is $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Since $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, the kernel is $\\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. This is a torsion group, so its rank is 0.\n\n2.  **Analyze the cokernel:** The cokernel is $\\Gamma(H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$. We know $H_2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n    For a free abelian group $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^n$, the group $\\Gamma(A)$ is also a free abelian group of rank given by:\n    $$\\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^n)) = n + \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n    In our case, $n=53$.\n    $$\\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})) = \\frac{53(53+1)}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 54}{2} = 53 \\times 27$$\n\n3.  **Final calculation:**\n    $53 \\times 27 = 53 \\times (30 - 3) = 1590 - 159 = 1431$.\n\nSo, the rank of the cokernel $\\Gamma(H_2(X))$ is 1431.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$:**\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) + \\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}))$\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 0 + 1431 = 1431$.\n\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1431."
