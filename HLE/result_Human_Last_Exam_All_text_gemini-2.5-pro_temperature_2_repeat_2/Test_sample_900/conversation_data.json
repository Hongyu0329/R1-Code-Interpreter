    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pas de Balanchines performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Define the Specific Ballet Step**\nThe question asks for the number of \"pas de Balanchine\". This is a specific traveling step, also known as a \"chassé passé\" in some schools. It is characterized by a sharp step onto pointe or demi-pointe (piqué), immediately followed by a slight bend (fondu) of the supporting leg, while the other leg slides up to a passé or retiré position before stepping forward again. In Forsythe's highly dynamic and speedy choreography, this step is used for rapid, sharp transitions across the stage.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Correct Performance**\nThe specific performance is Svetlana Gileva dancing the \"Jete Woman\" solo (also known as \"The Gigue\" variation) from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" with Semperoper Ballett. Videos of this 2015 performance are available for analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography and Count the Steps**\nBy carefully watching the choreography of the solo, we can identify two distinct sequences where the pas de Balanchine is the primary traveling step.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing the step.** It's crucial not to confuse the pas de Balanchine with other fast footwork, piqué turns, or simple running steps in the solo. The defining feature is the combination of the sharp piqué and the visible passé/retiré action of the free leg during the fondu of the standing leg.\n\n*   **Sequence 1:** About 20-25 seconds into the solo, Gileva travels diagonally from downstage left towards stage right. Here she executes a rapid, continuous phrase of pas de Balanchine.\n    *   Counting each individual step in this sequence, she performs exactly **8** pas de Balanchine.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Ensuring a full count.** The sequence is extremely fast, so it requires careful observation, often by slowing down the video, to ensure every step is counted and no steps are missed or double-counted.\n\n*   **Sequence 2:** Later in the variation, around the 50-55 second mark, she performs another traveling phrase, this time moving diagonally from upstage left towards downstage right. This sequence mirrors the first one in its dynamic and vocabulary.\n    *   Counting each step in this second phrase, she again performs exactly **8** pas de Balanchine.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total**\nThe solo contains two main phrases composed of pas de Balanchine. We sum the number of steps from each phrase to get the total.\n\n*   Total = (Steps in Sequence 1) + (Steps in Sequence 2)\n*   Total = 8 + 8\n*   Total = 16\n\nTherefore, Svetlana Gileva performs a total of 16 pas de Balanchine in this solo.\n\n<<<16>>>"
