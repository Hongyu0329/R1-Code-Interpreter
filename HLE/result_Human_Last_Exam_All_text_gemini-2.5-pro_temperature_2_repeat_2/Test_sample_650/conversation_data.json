    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is as follows:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Main Computational Work:** The core of the algorithm's execution time is the `while` loop (step 2). The initialization in step 1 and the return statement in step 3 are executed only once and take constant time, so their contribution to the complexity is minimal. We must determine how many times the `while` loop runs and what the cost of each iteration is.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Operations Inside the Loop:**\n    *   Each iteration of the `while` loop consists of the following operations in step 2.1:\n        *   `i := i + 1`: One increment operation.\n        *   `x := q`: One assignment operation.\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One integer division.\n        *   `a_i := x - q*c`: One multiplication and one subtraction.\n    *   Under the standard \"uniform cost model\" used in algorithm analysis, we assume that these basic arithmetic operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction) on numbers that fit within a machine's word size take constant time. Therefore, the work done inside each loop iteration is constant, which we denote as `O(1)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true. We need to see how `q` changes with each iteration.\n    *   Let's trace the value that determines `q`. This value is `x`.\n    *   Initially (in step 1), `x` is set to `n`.\n    *   In the first execution of the loop body (if `⌊n/c⌋ > 0`), `x` is updated to the old value of `q`, which was `⌊n/c⌋`. The new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`.\n    *   In general, in each iteration, the value of `x` is roughly divided by `c`. Let's denote the value of `q` at the start of the `k`-th iteration of the while loop as `q_{k-1}`.\n        *   After step 1: `q_0 = ⌊n/c⌋`\n        *   After 1st iteration: `q_1 = ⌊q_0/c⌋ ≈ n/c²`\n        *   After 2nd iteration: `q_2 = ⌊q_1/c⌋ ≈ n/c³`\n        *   After `k` iterations: `q_k ≈ n/c^(k+1)`\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n / c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1.\n        `n / c^(k+1) < 1`\n        `n < c^(k+1)`\n    *   To find the number of iterations `k`, we can take the logarithm base `c` of both sides:\n        `log_c(n) < k + 1`\n    *   This shows that the number of iterations, `k`, is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The number of iterations is precisely the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`, minus one. The number of digits is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`, so the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times. For complexity analysis, this is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Computational Time Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity is the product of the number of iterations and the cost per iteration.\n    *   Total Time = (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration)\n    *   Total Time = `O(log_c(n))` × `O(1)`\n    *   Total Time = `O(log_c(n))`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The analysis depends on the assumption that arithmetic operations are `O(1)`. This is standard unless dealing with arbitrary-precision numbers where the number of bits matters.\n*   The base of the logarithm, `c`, is important for the exact number of iterations. However, in Big-O notation, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)` because they differ only by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log_2(n) / log_2(c)`), and constant factors are ignored. Both notations are considered correct, but `O(log_c(n))` is more specific to the algorithm's behavior.\n*   The complexity is logarithmic in the *value* of the input `n`, not its *size* (number of bits). If the input size is considered to be `k = log(n)` bits, then the complexity is linear in the input size, `O(k)`. However, complexity is conventionally expressed in terms of the input value `n`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is logarithmic with respect to the input `n`.\n\n<<<O(log_c n)>>>"
