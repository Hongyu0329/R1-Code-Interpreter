    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understanding the condition**\n\nLet K be a convex domain in the plane. The condition is that K must intersect every line of the form $px + qy = 1$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers. Let's denote the set of these lines by $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\nFor a given line $L_{p,q}: px+qy=1$, the condition $K \\cap L_{p,q} \\neq \\emptyset$ means that the set of values of the linear function $f(x,y) = px+qy$ for $(x,y) \\in K$ must include the value 1.\nLet $M_{p,q} = \\sup_{(x,y) \\in K} (px+qy)$ and $m_{p,q} = \\inf_{(x,y) \\in K} (px+qy)$.\nSince K is a convex domain (a closed and bounded convex set), the set of values $\\{px+qy : (x,y) \\in K\\}$ is the closed interval $[m_{p,q}, M_{p,q}]$.\nThe condition is that for all coprime integers $p$ and $q$, we must have $1 \\in [m_{p,q}, M_{p,q}]$, which means:\n$m_{p,q} \\le 1 \\le M_{p,q}$.\n\n**2. Deriving constraints on the domain K from specific lines**\n\nWe can find necessary properties of K by considering specific lines from the family $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\n*   **Consider the horizontal direction (p=1, q=0 and p=-1, q=0):**\n    *   For $(p,q) = (1,0)$, the pair is coprime. The line is $x=1$. The condition is $m_{1,0} \\le 1 \\le M_{1,0}$.\n        $m_{1,0} = \\inf_{(x,y)\\in K} x = x_{min}$\n        $M_{1,0} = \\sup_{(x,y)\\in K} x = x_{max}$\n        So we must have $x_{min} \\le 1$ and $x_{max} \\ge 1$.\n    *   For $(p,q) = (-1,0)$, the pair is coprime. The line is $-x=1$, or $x=-1$. The condition is $m_{-1,0} \\le 1 \\le M_{-1,0}$.\n        $m_{-1,0} = \\inf_{(x,y)\\in K} (-x) = -x_{max}$\n        $M_{-1,0} = \\sup_{(x,y)\\in K} (-x) = -x_{min}$\n        So we must have $-x_{max} \\le 1$ and $-x_{min} \\ge 1$, which is equivalent to $x_{max} \\ge -1$ and $x_{min} \\le -1$.\n    *   Combining these conditions for the horizontal direction:\n        We need ($x_{max} \\ge 1$) and ($x_{min} \\le -1$). This means the projection of the convex set K onto the x-axis must contain the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   The width of K in the x-direction, denoted $W_x$, is $W_x = x_{max} - x_{min}$. The condition implies $W_x \\ge 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Consider the vertical direction (p=0, q=1 and p=0, q=-1):**\n    *   Similarly, for $(p,q)=(0,1)$, we get $y_{min} \\le 1 \\le y_{max}$.\n    *   For $(p,q)=(0,-1)$, we get $-y_{max} \\le 1 \\le -y_{min}$, which is $y_{max} \\ge -1$ and $y_{min} \\le -1$.\n    *   Combining these, we get $y_{max} \\ge 1$ and $y_{min} \\le -1$. The projection of K onto the y-axis must contain $[-1,1]$.\n    *   The width of K in the y-direction, $W_y = y_{max} - y_{min}$, must be at least $2$.\n\n**3. Finding the minimal area under these constraints**\n\nWe are looking for a convex set K of minimal area that satisfies $W_x(K) \\ge 2$ and $W_y(K) \\ge 2$.\nThere is a known theorem in geometry for any planar convex set K:\nArea(K) $\\ge \\frac{1}{2} W_x(K) W_y(K)$.\n(This can be proven by considering the convex hull of the four points of contact with the vertical and horizontal supporting lines of K, whose area is at least $\\frac{1}{2}W_x W_y$ and which is contained in K).\n\nApplying this inequality with our derived width constraints:\nArea(K) $\\ge \\frac{1}{2} (2)(2) = 2$.\nThis shows that the minimal area must be at least 2.\n\n**4. Verifying if the minimum is achievable**\n\nTo show that 2 is indeed the minimal area, we need to find a convex domain K that satisfies the condition and has an area of exactly 2.\n\nConsider the domain $K_0$ defined by the inequality $|x| + |y| \\le 1$.\n*   This domain is a square with vertices at $(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)$.\n*   It is a convex set.\n*   The area of this square can be calculated as half the product of its diagonals. The diagonals are from $(-1,0)$ to $(1,0)$ and from $(0,-1)$ to $(0,1)$, so their lengths are $d_1=2$ and $d_2=2$.\n    Area($K_0$) = $\\frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 = \\frac{1}{2} (2)(2) = 2$.\n\nNow, we must verify that $K_0$ satisfies the condition for all coprime integers $p$ and $q$.\nWe need to check that for any such $(p,q)$, we have $m_{p,q} \\le 1 \\le M_{p,q}$.\nFor the domain $K_0$, the function $f(x,y)=px+qy$ is linear, so its supremum and infimum are achieved at the vertices.\n$M_{p,q} = \\sup_{(x,y)\\in K_0}(px+qy) = \\max\\{p(1)+q(0), p(0)+q(1), p(-1)+q(0), p(0)+q(-1)\\}$\n$M_{p,q} = \\max\\{p, q, -p, -q\\} = \\max\\{|p|, |q|\\}$.\nSimilarly, $m_{p,q} = \\inf_{(x,y)\\in K_0}(px+qy) = \\min\\{p, q, -p, -q\\} = -\\max\\{|p|, |q|\\}$.\n\nThe condition becomes: $-\\max\\{|p|, |q|\\} \\le 1 \\le \\max\\{|p|, |q|\\}$ for all coprime integers $p, q$.\nThe left inequality, $-\\max\\{|p|, |q|\\} \\le 1$, is always true since $|p|,|q|$ are non-negative.\nThe right inequality is $\\max\\{|p|, |q|\\} \\ge 1$. Let's check this for any coprime integers $p,q$.\nSince $p,q$ are coprime, they cannot both be zero.\n*   If $p \\ne 0$, then $|p|$ is an integer $\\ge 1$. So $\\max\\{|p|, |q|\\} \\ge |p| \\ge 1$.\n*   If $p=0$, then for $p,q$ to be coprime, we must have $\\gcd(0,q)=|q|=1$. So $|q|=1$, and $\\max\\{|p|, |q|\\} = \\max\\{0,1\\}=1$.\nIn all cases, the condition $\\max\\{|p|,|q|\\} \\ge 1$ holds.\nSo, the domain $K_0 = \\{(x,y): |x|+|y|\\le 1\\}$ is a valid domain.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that any such convex domain K must have an area of at least 2. We have also found a specific domain that satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2. Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   Correctly interpreting the \"intersects\" condition as $m_{p,q} \\le 1 \\le M_{p,q}$.\n*   Using a sufficient set of lines ($( \\pm 1,0), (0, \\pm 1)$) to derive necessary geometric constraints (the widths).\n*   Applying the correct geometric inequality relating area to widths ($A \\ge \\frac{1}{2}W_x W_y$).\n*   Constructing a candidate shape that achieves the lower bound of area.\n*   Rigorously verifying that the candidate shape satisfies the condition for *all* coprime pairs $(p,q)$, not just the ones used to derive the constraints. The property of coprime integers is crucial here.\n\nThe final answer is the minimal area, which is 2.\n\n>>>2"
