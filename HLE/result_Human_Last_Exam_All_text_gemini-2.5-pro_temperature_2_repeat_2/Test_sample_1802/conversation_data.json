    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$ and its Choi Matrix**\n\nA qudit is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on the space of $d \\times d$ density matrices is defined by the action:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} U_{jk} \\rho U_{jk}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{U_{jk} = X^j Z^k\\}_{j,k=0}^{d-1}$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators). The coefficients $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ form a probability distribution, meaning $p_{j,k} \\ge 0$ for all $j,k$ and $\\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} = 1$.\n\nThe channel $\\Lambda$ can be represented by a set of Kraus operators $A_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}}} U_{jk}$. The number of non-zero Kraus operators is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{j,k}$. This number is called the Kraus rank of the channel. The Pauli operators $\\{U_{jk}\\}$ form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, so they are linearly independent. Therefore, the Kraus rank of $\\Lambda$ is equal to the number of non-zero $p_{j,k}$, let's denote this by $r$. The maximum possible Kraus rank is $d^2$, which occurs when all $p_{j,k} > 0$.\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$ of a channel $\\Lambda$ is given by $J(\\Lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^r \\text{vec}(A_i)\\text{vec}(A_i)^\\dagger$, where $r$ is the number of Kraus operators $A_i$. The rank of $J(\\Lambda)$ is the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to represent the channel, which is the Kraus rank.\nThus, $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda)) = r$. The maximum rank for a Pauli channel is $d^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Complementary Channel to the Original Channel**\n\nFor a quantum channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_i\\}_{i=1}^r$, the Stinespring dilation involves an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_S \\to \\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$, where $\\mathcal{H}_S$ is the system's Hilbert space ($\\mathbb{C}^d$) and $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is an environment Hilbert space of dimension $r$. The isometry is given by $V = \\sum_{i=1}^r A_i \\otimes |i\\rangle_E$.\nThe original channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is obtained by tracing out the system: $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\nA fundamental theorem in quantum information theory connects the Choi matrix of a channel to that of its complementary channel via the reshuffling operation. Let $J(\\Lambda)$ be the Choi matrix of $\\Lambda$ acting on $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_S$, and $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ be the Choi matrix of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ acting on $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. The relationship is that, up to an isomorphism of the environment space, the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the Schmidt rank of the Choi matrix of the original channel. The Schmidt rank of an operator $M \\in \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B)$ is defined as the rank of its reshuffled version, $M^R$.\nThus, we have the key relation:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = \\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda)^R) = \\text{rank}_S(J(\\Lambda)) $$\nOur task is to find the maximum possible value of $\\text{rank}_S(J(\\Lambda))$ by choosing the probabilities $p_{j,k}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choi Matrix of a Pauli Channel and its Schmidt Rank**\n\nThe Choi matrix of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a weighted sum of projectors onto maximally entangled states:\n$$ J(\\Lambda) = d \\sum_{j,k} p_{j,k} |\\phi_{jk}\\rangle\\langle\\phi_{jk}| $$\nwhere $\\{|\\phi_{jk}\\rangle = (I \\otimes U_{jk})|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\}$ form an orthonormal basis of maximally entangled states, and $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}|i,i\\rangle$.\n\nThe Schmidt rank of a sum of operators satisfies the inequality $\\text{rank}_S(A+B) \\le \\text{rank}_S(A) + \\text{rank}_S(B)$. The Schmidt rank of a rank-1 operator $|\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|$ is given by $(\\text{rank}_S(|\\phi\\rangle))^2$. Since each $|\\phi_{jk}\\rangle$ is a maximally entangled state, its Schmidt rank (as a vector) is $d$. Therefore, the Schmidt rank of the operator $|\\phi_{jk}\\rangle\\langle\\phi_{jk}|$ (which is identified with the vector $|\\phi_{jk}\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi_{jk}^*\\rangle$) is $(\\text{rank}_S(|\\phi_{jk}\\rangle))^2 = d^2$.\nThis provides a loose upper bound, but does not determine the maximal rank of the sum.\n\n**Step 4: Find a Specific Pauli Channel that Maximizes the Rank**\n\nLet's consider a specific, important example of a Pauli channel: the completely depolarizing channel, where all Pauli errors occur with equal probability.\nFor this channel, $p_{j,k} = 1/d^2$ for all $j,k$. The channel maps any state $\\rho$ to the maximally mixed state: $\\Lambda_{dep}(\\rho) = \\frac{\\text{Tr}(\\rho)}{d}I_d$.\nThe Choi matrix of this channel is:\n$$ J(\\Lambda_{dep}) = d \\sum_{j,k} \\frac{1}{d^2} |\\phi_{jk}\\rangle\\langle\\phi_{jk}| = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{j,k} |\\phi_{jk}\\rangle\\langle\\phi_{jk}| $$\nSince $\\{|\\phi_{jk}\\rangle\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the space $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_S$, the sum of projectors is the identity operator on this space:\n$$ J(\\Lambda_{dep}) = \\frac{1}{d} I_{d^2} = \\frac{1}{d} (I_d \\otimes I_d) $$\nNow, we need to compute the Schmidt rank of this Choi matrix, which is the rank of its reshuffling. Let $M = I_d \\otimes I_d$. The elements of this matrix are $M_{ik,jl} = \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl}$.\nThe reshuffled matrix $M^R$ has elements $(M^R)_{ij,kl} = M_{ik,jl} = \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj}$.\nThis corresponds to the operator $M^R = \\sum_{i,j,k,l} \\delta_{il}\\delta_{kj} |i,j\\rangle\\langle k,l| = \\sum_{j,l} |l,j\\rangle\\langle j,l|$. This is the SWAP operator, which exchanges the two qudit systems. The SWAP operator is full rank. Its matrix has dimension $d^2 \\times d^2$. Therefore, its rank is $d^2$.\nSo, for the completely depolarizing channel, the rank of the complementary channel is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}_{dep}) = \\text{rank}((J(\\Lambda_{dep}))^R) = \\text{rank}\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{d}I_{d^2}\\right)^R\\right) = \\text{rank}\\left(\\frac{1}{d} \\text{SWAP}\\right) = d^2 $$\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Maximal Rank**\n\nWe have found an example of a Pauli channel (the completely depolarizing channel) for which the rank of its complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\nCan the rank be larger than $d^2$?\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ has a number of Kraus operators, $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, that is bounded. Any linear map from $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbb{C}^d)$ to $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbb{C}^r)$ has a Choi rank of at most $d^2$. Thus, $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) \\le d^2$.\n\nSince we have found a channel that achieves the upper bound of $d^2$, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The rank of a complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is equal to the Schmidt rank of the Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$ of the original channel. The Schmidt rank of $J(\\Lambda)$ is the rank of the reshuffled matrix $J(\\Lambda)^R$.\n2.  We seek to maximize this rank by choosing the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n3.  Consider the completely depolarizing channel, $\\Lambda_{dep}$, which is a Pauli channel with $p_{j,k}=1/d^2$ for all $j,k$.\n4.  The Choi matrix for this channel is proportional to the identity matrix: $J(\\Lambda_{dep}) \\propto I_{d^2}$.\n5.  The reshuffling of the identity matrix is the SWAP operator, which has a rank of $d^2$.\n6.  Thus, for the completely depolarizing channel, the complementary channel has a rank of $d^2$.\n7.  The rank of a channel mapping $d \\times d$ matrices to any other space of matrices is bounded above by $d^2$.\n8.  Therefore, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\n>>>$d^2$"
