    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Given:** We have a graph $G$.\n*   **Number of vertices:** $|V(G)| = n = 12345$.\n*   **Condition 1:** The graph $G$ is **not** a complete graph ($G \\neq K_n$). A complete graph $K_n$ is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   **Mention of Maximum Degree $\\Delta(G)$:** The question mentions the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, which is the highest degree among all vertices in $G$. This is a standard property of any graph.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". A proper coloring assigns colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The minimum number of colors needed for a specific graph $G$ is its chromatic number, denoted $\\chi(G)$. The question is asking for the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ over all graphs $G$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n*   **Formal Goal:** Find the value of $\\max\\{\\chi(G) \\mid |V(G)| = 12345 \\text{ and } G \\neq K_{12345}\\}$.\n\n**2. Establish an Upper Bound**\n\n*   For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$. That is, $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique color to each of the $n$ vertices.\n*   The only case where we absolutely *must* use $n$ different colors is when every vertex is connected to every other vertex. If any two vertices, say $u$ and $v$, were not connected, we could assign them the same color, meaning we would need at most $n-1$ colors.\n*   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.\n*   The problem explicitly states that $G$ is **not** a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n*   This implies that $\\chi(G)$ must be strictly less than $n$. So, $\\chi(G) < n$, which means $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n*   For our specific case, with $n = 12345$, this means the maximum number of colors cannot exceed $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n**3. Verify if the Upper Bound is Attainable**\n\nNow we need to check if it's possible for a non-complete graph with 12345 vertices to actually require 12344 colors. To do this, we must construct such a graph.\n\n*   **Construction:** Let's create a graph $G$ as follows:\n    1.  Take a set of $n-1 = 12344$ vertices and form a complete graph on them. This subgraph is $K_{12344}$.\n    2.  Add one more vertex to the graph, let's call it $v_{12345}$.\n    3.  Do not add any edges connected to this new vertex. It is an isolated vertex.\n*   **Verification:** Let's check if this constructed graph $G$ meets the conditions.\n    1.  **Number of vertices:** The graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. This is correct.\n    2.  **Is it a complete graph?** No. The vertex $v_{12345}$ is not connected to any other vertex. In a complete $K_{12345}$, every vertex must be connected to all other 12344 vertices. So, $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n*   **Calculate the Chromatic Number of our constructed graph G:**\n    1.  The subgraph $K_{12344}$ contains 12344 vertices, and every vertex is connected to every other vertex within this subgraph. Therefore, coloring this part of the graph requires at least 12344 different colors. This establishes a lower bound: $\\chi(G) \\ge 12344$.\n    2.  We can find a proper coloring using exactly 12344 colors. Assign 12344 unique colors to the vertices of the $K_{12344}$ subgraph. For the isolated vertex $v_{12345}$, we can assign it any of these 12344 colors (for instance, the same color as the first vertex of $K_{12344}$) because it has no neighbors. This coloring is proper. This shows that $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n    3.  Combining these two points, the chromatic number of our constructed graph is exactly $\\chi(G) = 12344$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   The phrasing \"maximum number of colours that we need\" refers to the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph G fitting the description.\n*   The most crucial piece of information is that the graph is **not** complete. This immediately lowers the maximum possible chromatic number from $n$ to $n-1$.\n*   The existence of a clique of size $k$ (a $K_k$ subgraph) in a graph $G$ forces $\\chi(G) \\ge k$. This is the key to constructing a graph with a high chromatic number. Our example graph contains a $K_{12344}$.\n*   The mention of $\\Delta(G)$ is a potential distraction. While Brooks' Theorem relates $\\chi(G)$ and $\\Delta(G)$, it's not needed for this problem. A more fundamental argument about the definition of chromatic number and complete graphs is sufficient and more direct. For the record, in our constructed example $G = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G)=12343$, and the chromatic number is $\\chi(G)=12344$. This is a case where $\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1$, which is allowed by Brooks' Theorem for graphs that contain a complete graph as a connected component.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have established that any graph $G$ on 12345 vertices that is not complete can be colored with at most 12344 colors. We have also constructed a specific graph that is not complete and requires exactly 12344 colors. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nNumber of vertices $n = 12345$.\nMaximum chromatic number = $n - 1 = 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
