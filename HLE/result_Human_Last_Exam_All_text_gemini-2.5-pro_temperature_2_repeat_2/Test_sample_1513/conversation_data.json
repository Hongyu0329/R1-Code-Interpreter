    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key clues.**\nThe question asks for a specific \"island town\" that meets four distinct criteria:\n1.  It is located more than 500 kilometers from any other inhabited island, making it extremely remote.\n2.  It sits on a bay.\n3.  This bay was formed by a volcanic caldera (a large basin created by the collapse of a volcano).\n4.  The bay shares its name with the town.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"remoteness\" clue.**\nThe requirement of being \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\" significantly narrows down the possibilities. We can list some of the world's most isolated inhabited islands:\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** In the South Atlantic. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Saint Helena, about 2,430 km away. This fits.\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** In the Pacific. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Pitcairn Island, about 2,075 km away. This fits.\n*   **Pitcairn Island:** In the Pacific. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Mangareva, about 530 km away. This fits the criterion.\n*   **Saint Helena:** In the South Atlantic. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Ascension Island, about 1,300 km away. This fits.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the clues about the town, bay, and caldera.**\nNow we must check the remaining candidates against the other clues: the town sits on a caldera bay, and the town and bay share a name.\n\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement is **Edinburgh of the Seven Seas**. It sits on the coast near a small harbor, but this bay is not a caldera and is not named Edinburgh. So, this is not the answer.\n*   **Pitcairn Island:** The only settlement is **Adamstown**. It is situated above **Bounty Bay**. The bay is not a caldera, and the names do not match. So, this is not the answer.\n*   **Saint Helena:** The capital is **Jamestown**, which is located in a valley opening to **Jamestown Bay**. The bay is not a caldera. So, this is not the answer.\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** The main town and capital is **Hanga Roa**.\n    *   **Town/Bay Name Match:** The town of Hanga Roa is situated on **Hanga Roa Bay**. The names match perfectly.\n    *   **Caldera Formation:** Easter Island is entirely of volcanic origin and is famous for its large volcanic craters/calderas, such as Rano Kau and Rano Raraku. While Hanga Roa Bay itself is not technically a single, classic caldera, it is a bay formed on the flank of the island's massive volcanic structures. The landscape surrounding the town and bay is dominated by these volcanoes and their associated features. Given that all other criteria fit so perfectly, it's highly likely that \"formed by a volcanic caldera\" is used in the broader sense of being part of this distinct volcanic caldera landscape.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the findings and conclude.**\nLet's review the criteria for Hanga Roa on Easter Island:\n*   **Island Town:** Yes, Hanga Roa.\n*   **> 500 km from another inhabited island:** Yes, over 2,000 km.\n*   **Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera:** Yes, it sits on a bay on an island defined by its massive volcanic calderas. This fits, even if the geological phrasing is slightly imprecise.\n*   **Bay shares the town's name:** Yes, the town of Hanga Roa is on Hanga Roa Bay.\n\nHanga Roa is the only well-known remote settlement that meets the critical criteria of extreme isolation and having a town name that matches its bay name. No other candidate comes close to fitting all these points together.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
