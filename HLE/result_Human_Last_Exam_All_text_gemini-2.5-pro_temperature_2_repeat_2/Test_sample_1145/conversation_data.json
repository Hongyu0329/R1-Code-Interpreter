    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Wave Function**\n\n*   **System:** A particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well (a \"box\") of length `a`. The potential is zero inside the box (from `x=0` to `x=a`) and infinite outside.\n*   **Wave Function:** The normalized stationary state wave functions for this system are given by:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n    where `n` is the quantum number (`n = 1, 2, 3, ...`).\n*   **Specified State:** The problem asks for the `n = 2` state (the first excited state). So, the wave function is:\n    `ψ_2(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)`\n\n**2. Formulate the Probability Calculation**\n\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the probability density, `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2`. For our case:\n    `P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|^2 = (sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx/a))^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a)`\n*   **Probability in an Interval:** To find the probability that the particle is located in a specific interval from `x1` to `x2`, we must integrate the probability density over that interval:\n    `Prob(x1 ≤ x ≤ x2) = ∫[from x1 to x2] |ψ_n(x)|^2 dx`\n*   **Specified Interval:** The problem gives the interval `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n*   **The Integral:** Substituting the values, we get the integral to solve:\n    `Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a) dx`\n\n**3. Analyze the Interval and Simplify the Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Small Interval.** The width of the interval is `Δx = x2 - x1 = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`. This is a very small fraction of the total box length `a`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Location of the Interval.** The interval is centered at `x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: A Node at the Center.** For the `n=2` state, let's check the probability density at the center of the box, `x = 0.5a`:\n    `P(0.5a) = (2/a) * sin^2(2π(0.5a)/a) = (2/a) * sin^2(π) = (2/a) * (0)^2 = 0`.\n    This point is a **node**, a point where the probability of finding the particle is zero.\n*   **Approximation Strategy:** Since the interval is very small and centered around a node, we can make an excellent approximation. A simple approach like `Prob ≈ P(x_center) * Δx` would incorrectly give 0. We need a more careful approximation. We can use a Taylor series expansion of the `sin` function around the node.\n    Let's change variables to simplify. Let `u = x - 0.5a`, which means `x = u + 0.5a`. The center of the interval is now `u=0`.\n    The limits of integration for `u` become `(0.495a - 0.5a) = -0.005a` and `(0.505a - 0.5a) = +0.005a`.\n    The integrand becomes:\n    `sin^2(2πx/a) = sin^2(2π(u + 0.5a)/a) = sin^2(2πu/a + π)`\n    Using the identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we get:\n    `sin^2(2πu/a + π) = [-sin(2πu/a)]^2 = sin^2(2πu/a)`\n*   **The Approximated Integral:** The integral is now:\n    `Prob = ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πu/a) du`\n    For small `u` (which is true throughout our small integration interval), the argument of the sine function `θ = 2πu/a` is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    `sin^2(2πu/a) ≈ (2πu/a)^2 = (4π^2u^2)/a^2`\n    The integral becomes:\n    `Prob ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * [(4π^2u^2)/a^2] du`\n    `Prob ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) * ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] u^2 du`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral and Find the Final Answer**\n\n*   First, we solve the simple polynomial integral:\n    `∫ u^2 du = u^3 / 3`\n    Now, evaluate it over the limits:\n    `∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] u^2 du = [u^3/3]_(-0.005a)^(0.005a) = [(0.005a)^3 / 3] - [(-0.005a)^3 / 3]`\n    `= (0.005a)^3 / 3 + (0.005a)^3 / 3 = (2/3) * (0.005a)^3`\n*   Now substitute this result back into the expression for the probability:\n    `Prob ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) * [(2/3) * (0.005a)^3]`\n    `Prob ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) * (2/3) * (0.005)^3 * a^3`\n    The `a^3` terms cancel out, as expected.\n    `Prob ≈ (16π^2 / 3) * (0.005)^3`\n    `Prob ≈ (16π^2 / 3) * (1.25 * 10^-7)`\n*   Now, we compute the numerical value (using `π^2 ≈ 9.87`):\n    `Prob ≈ (16 * 9.87 / 3) * 1.25 * 10^-7`\n    `Prob ≈ (157.92 / 3) * 1.25 * 10^-7`\n    `Prob ≈ 52.64 * 1.25 * 10^-7`\n    `Prob ≈ 65.8 * 10^-7`\n    `Prob ≈ 6.58 * 10^-6`\n\nThe probability is a very small, dimensionless number, which is expected for a tiny interval around a node.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe final probability is approximately `6.58 x 10^-6`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
