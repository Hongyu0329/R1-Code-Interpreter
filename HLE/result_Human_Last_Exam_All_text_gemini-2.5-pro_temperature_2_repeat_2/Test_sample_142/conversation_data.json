    "This problem asks for the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a specific molecule and basis set in a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the system:**\n    *   **Molecule:** $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n    *   **Calculation type:** Full Configuration Interaction (CI).\n    *   **Basis set:** 6-31G**.\n    *   **Target property:** The number of singlet CSFs (Configuration State Functions), as this is the ground state spin multiplicity for this closed-shell molecule.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of electrons ($N_{elec}$):**\n    We sum the atomic numbers of all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron each. There are three H atoms ($ \\mathrm{CH}_2\\text{ and }\\mathrm{H} $), so 3 x 1 = 3 electrons.\n    *   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n    *   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n    *   Total electrons $N_{elec} = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of basis functions (molecular orbitals, $N_{orb}$):**\n    The number of basis functions is determined by the chosen basis set (6-31G**) for each atom. The `**` notation indicates that d-type polarization functions are added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions are added to hydrogen atoms. We use the standard 6 Cartesian d-functions and 3 p-functions.\n\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H):** 6-31G splits the 1s orbital into 2 functions. The `*` adds a set of p-orbitals (px, py, pz).\n        *   Functions: 2 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 5 basis functions.\n        *   Since there are 3 H atoms, the total from hydrogen is $3 \\times 5 = 15$.\n    *   **For Carbon (C), a 2nd-row heavy atom:** 6-31G gives 9 functions (1 for 1s core, 8 for split valence 2s and 2p). The `*` adds a set of d-orbitals.\n        *   Functions: 9 (s,p-type) + 6 (d-type) = 15 basis functions.\n    *   **For Fluorine (F), a 2nd-row heavy atom:** Same as Carbon.\n        *   Functions: 9 (s,p-type) + 6 (d-type) = 15 basis functions.\n    *   **For Silicon (Si), a 3rd-row heavy atom:** 6-31G gives 13 functions (5 for 1s,2s,2p core, 8 for split valence 3s and 3p). The `*` adds a set of d-orbitals.\n        *   Functions: 13 (s,p-type) + 6 (d-type) = 19 basis functions.\n\n    *   **Total number of basis functions:**\n        $N_{orb} = (\\text{from C}) + (\\text{from 3H}) + (\\text{from Si}) + (\\text{from F})$\n        $N_{orb} = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$.\n\n4.  **Use the correct formula for the number of singlet CSFs:**\n    The number of singlet ($S=0$) CSFs for a system with $N_{elec}$ electrons distributed among $N_{orb}$ spatial orbitals is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula or, equivalently, by subtracting the number of determinants with $M_S=1$ from the number of determinants with $M_S=0$. Let $n = N_{orb}$ and $k = N_{elec}/2$.\n\n    *   Number of ways to choose alpha-spin orbitals: $\\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{\\alpha}}$\n    *   Number of ways to choose beta-spin orbitals: $\\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{\\beta}}$\n    *   For a singlet state, we are interested in CSFs with total spin $S=0$. For a closed-shell molecule, the total number of electrons is even. $N_{elec}=32$, so $N_{\\alpha} = N_{\\beta} = 16$.\n    *   The formula for the number of singlet CSFs is:\n        $N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{elec}/2}^2 - \\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{elec}/2 - 1}\\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{elec}/2 + 1}$\n    *   Plugging in our values ($N_{orb}=64$, $N_{elec}=32$):\n        $N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17}$\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    This requires calculating binomial coefficients with large numbers.\n    *   First, calculate the individual terms:\n        *   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16!48!} = 179,450,917,631,525,440$\n        *   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15!49!} = 58,551,320,042,946,944$\n        *   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17!47!} = 191,827,872,319,173,504$\n    *   Next, calculate the products:\n        *   $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (179,450,917,631,525,440)^2 = 32,202,633,005,574,381,333,792,224,051,200$\n        *   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (58,551,320,042,946,944) \\times (191,827,872,319,173,504) = 11,231,845,115,993,883,011,382,903,708,8768$\n    *   Finally, perform the subtraction:\n        *   $N_{CSF} = 32,202,633,005,574,381,333,792,224,051,200 - 11,231,845,115,993,883,011,382,903,708,8768$\n        *   $N_{CSF} = 20,970,787,889,580,498,322,409,320,342,3232$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of CSFs is $20,970,787,889,580,498,322,409,320,342,3232$.\n\n<<<209707878895804983224093203423232>>>"
