    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle's logic.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Data Format**\nThe task is to find the transformation rule that converts an input string into an output string. The strings represent a 2D grid of digits ('0', '1', '2'), with rows separated by commas. After deducing the rule from examples A and B, we must apply it to Input_C to find the corresponding output.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Input_A and Output_A**\n*   **Input_A:** `'001111,121111,111111'`\n    Grid representation:\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 2 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Output_A:** `'201111,101111,111111'`\n    Grid representation:\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Comparison:** The '2' at position (1, 1) has moved to position (0, 0). The '0' that was originally at (0, 0) is now at (1, 1). This is a simple swap between the '2' and the '0' at (0, 0). Notably, (0, 0) is the very first '0' encountered when reading the grid from top-to-bottom, left-to-right.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Input_B and Output_B**\n*   **Input_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'`\n    The '2' is at position (3, 6).\n*   **Output_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`\n*   **Comparison:** The '2' from (3, 6) is gone (replaced by '0'), and a new '2' has appeared at (2, 7), which was originally a '0'. Unlike case A, this is not a swap with the *first* '0' in the grid. This suggests a different rule is at play here. This discrepancy is the core of the puzzle. There is also a change at `Input[2][8]`, which was '0' and became '1'. This might be a side-effect or an error in the provided example. Given the simplicity of case A, it's safer to focus on the main movement of the '2'.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Unified Hypothesis**\nThe behavior in A and B is different. This implies a primary rule and a fallback or default rule.\n*   The number '1' seems to act as a wall or a pivot point.\n*   The number '0' is empty space.\n*   The number '2' is an active object that moves.\n\nLet's propose a \"pivot rule\" that would explain B's specific move, and see why it doesn't apply to A, forcing A to use a default action.\n\n**The Pivot Rule Hypothesis:**\n1.  **Locate the '2'**: Find its coordinates `(r, c)`.\n2.  **Find a Pivot**: Search the 8 neighbors of the '2' in a fixed order (e.g., clockwise starting from the top: U, UR, R, DR, D, DL, L, UL). The first neighbor that is a '1' is chosen as the pivot point `(pr, pc)`.\n3.  **Attempt Rotation**: Calculate the destination coordinates `(tr, tc)` by rotating the '2's position `(r,c)` 90 degrees clockwise around the pivot. The formula is `tr = pr + (c - pc)` and `tc = pc - (r - pr)`.\n4.  **Check Validity**: The move is valid only if the destination `(tr, tc)` is within the grid boundaries and contains a '0'.\n5.  **Execution**: If a valid move is found, the '2' moves to `(tr, tc)` and its original position `(r, c)` becomes a '0'. The first valid pivot move found is the one executed.\n6.  **Default Action**: If no valid pivot move can be found after checking all neighbors, perform a default action.\n\n**Step 5: Test the Hypothesis**\n*   **Testing on B**:\n    - '2' is at `(3, 6)`.\n    - Neighbors are searched clockwise. The first '1' is found to the right (R) at `(3, 7)`. This is our pivot.\n    - Rotating `(3, 6)` around pivot `(3, 7)` gives destination `(2, 7)`.\n    - The value at `Input_B[2][7]` is '0', so the move is valid.\n    - The rule correctly predicts that the '2' moves from `(3, 6)` to `(2, 7)`.\n\n*   **Testing on A**:\n    - '2' is at `(1, 1)`.\n    - We check all '1' neighbors as potential pivots. For each, we calculate the rotation destination. In every case, the destination is either out of bounds or lands on another '1'.\n    - Since no valid pivot move is found, the rule says to take the **Default Action**.\n    - **Default Action:** Swap the '2' with the first '0' found in the grid in reading order.\n    - The first '0' in `Input_A` is at `(0, 0)`. Swapping `Grid[1][1]` and `Grid[0][0]` produces `Output_A`. This matches perfectly.\n\nThe unified hypothesis works for both A and B (ignoring the minor side-effect in B as a likely anomaly).\n\n**Step 6: Apply the Rule to Input_C**\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n    Grid representation:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Locate the '2'**: It's at `(1, 4)`.\n*   **Find a Pivot Move**: We test the '1' neighbors of `(1, 4)` as pivots:\n    - Pivot `(2, 5)`: Rotation lands at `(1, 6)` (out of bounds).\n    - Pivot `(2, 4)`: Rotation lands at `(2, 5)` (contains a '1', not '0').\n    - Pivot `(2, 3)`: Rotation lands at `(3, 4)` (out of bounds).\n    - Pivot `(1, 3)`: Rotation lands at `(2, 3)` (contains a '1', not '0').\n    - Conclusion: There are no valid pivot moves.\n*   **Perform Default Action**: Since there is no pivot move, we swap the '2' at `(1, 4)` with the first '0' in the grid.\n*   The first '0' is at position `(0, 0)`.\n*   Performing the swap: `Grid[0][0]` becomes '2' and `Grid[1][4]` becomes '0'.\n\n**Step 7: Determine the Final Output**\nThe resulting grid for Input_C is:\n```\n2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\nConverting this grid back to the required string format gives: `'200000,011100,111111'`.\n\n<<<200000,011100,111111>>>"
