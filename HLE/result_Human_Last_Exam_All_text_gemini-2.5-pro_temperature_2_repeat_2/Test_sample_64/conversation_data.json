    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Word and its Pronunciation**\nThe word is 「弟」.\nIts reading in hiragana is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\nLet's break this down into morae (the units of sound that determine pitch in Japanese):\nお (o) - 1st mora\nと (to) - 2nd mora\nう (u) - 3rd mora (this 'u' elongates the 'o' sound in 'to', so it's part of the 'tou' sound, but it counts as a separate mora for pitch)\nと (to) - 4th mora\nSo, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Pitch Accent Types**\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"flat type\"):** The pitch is low on the first mora and high on all subsequent morae, including any particles that follow. Pattern: L-H-H-H... (where L=Low, H=High). For a four-mora word: お(L)とうと(H). With a particle: お(L)とうと(H)が(H).\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae. Pattern: H-L-L-L... For a four-mora word: お(H)とうと(L).\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises to high on a mora in the middle, and then falls before the end of the word. For a four-mora word, the fall could be on the 3rd or 4th mora. Example patterns: L-H-L-L or L-H-H-L.\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch is low on the first mora and high on all subsequent morae *within the word*, but it falls on the particle that follows. Pattern: L-H-H-H... but a following particle is low. For a four-mora word: お(L)とうと(H). With a particle: お(L)とうと(H)が(L).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Pitch Accent of 「弟」 (おとうと)**\nTo find the correct pattern, we refer to a standard Japanese pitch accent dictionary (like the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典).\nThe standard accent for 「弟」 (おとうと) is:\n*   お (o) is pronounced with a **low** pitch.\n*   と (to), う (u), and the final と (to) are all pronounced with a **high** pitch.\nThis gives us the pitch melody L-H-H-H.\n\n**Step 4: Use the \"Particle Test\" to Confirm**\nThe \"particle test\" helps distinguish between Heiban and Odaka patterns, as they can sound the same when the word is said in isolation. We attach a particle like 「が」 (ga).\n*   For 「弟が」 (otouto ga):\n    お (o) - Low\n    と (to) - High\n    う (u) - High\n    と (to) - High\n    が (ga) - High\nThe pitch melody is L-H-H-H-H. Since the pitch does *not* fall on the particle, it is not an Odaka pattern.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Pattern to the Answer Choices**\n*   The observed pattern for 「おとうと」 is L-H-H-H.\n*   The observed pattern for 「おとうとが」 is L-H-H-H-H.\n*   This perfectly matches the description of the **Heiban (平板式)** pattern.\n\n**Careful Points to Remember:**\n*   Pitch accent applies to morae, not syllables. 「とう」 is one syllable but two morae (to-u).\n*   The \"standard\" accent is based on the Tokyo dialect. Accents can vary in other regions.\n*   The behavior of the pitch on a following particle is crucial for distinguishing Heiban from Odaka patterns.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
