    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (-C=O) which is bonded to a nitrogen atom. This is the parent structure, and the carbon attached to the ring is C-1.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen of the amide functional group. So, the group at C-1 is -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is attached at the C-3 position of the benzene ring.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      C(=O)N(Et)₂\n      /\n(Benzene Ring) -- C1\n  //  \\\\\nC6     C2\n |      |\nC5     C3 -- N(CH₃)₂\n  \\\\  //\n    C4\n```\n\nThis molecule has two functional groups that can direct deprotonation: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group [-C(=O)N(Et)₂] and the dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂].\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction (Metalation)**\nThe reagents are `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) and `TMEDA` (tetramethylethylenediamine) in `THF` solvent.\n*   **sec-BuLi**: This is a very strong organometallic base.\n*   **TMEDA**: This is a bidentate ligand that chelates the lithium ion (Li⁺). This breaks up aggregates of sec-BuLi and makes the butyl anion a much more reactive \"superbase\".\n*   **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**: This combination of reagents is classic for a reaction called Directed ortho-Metalation. In this reaction, a functional group on an aromatic ring, known as a Directing Metalation Group (DMG), directs the strong base to remove a proton from an adjacent (ortho) position. Both functional groups in our molecule are known DMGs.\n\nWe need to determine which proton will be removed:\n*   The **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group** (-CONEt₂) is one of the strongest DMGs. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are C-2 and C-6.\n*   The **dimethylamino group** (-NMe₂) is also a good DMG. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are C-2 and C-4.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible sites for deprotonation (lithiation):\n*   **C-2 proton**: This proton is ortho to *both* the strong -CONEt₂ director and the -NMe₂ director. The deprotonation at this site is highly favored due to a cooperative or synergistic effect. The lithium ion can be stabilized by a six-membered chelate ring involving the carbonyl oxygen and the amine nitrogen. This makes the C-2 proton exceptionally acidic and the primary site of metalation.\n*   **C-6 proton**: This proton is only ortho to the -CONEt₂ group. It is a possible site but much less favored than C-2.\n*   **C-4 proton**: This proton is ortho to the weaker -NMe₂ group and para to the stronger -CONEt₂ group. Deprotonation here is less likely than at C-2.\n\nConclusion for Step 2: The sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C-2 position, forming a very nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction (Alkylation)**\nThe reagent is methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n*   **Methyl iodide**: This is an excellent electrophile. The carbon atom is electrophilic and readily attacked by nucleophiles.\n*   **The Reaction**: The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (effectively a carbanion at C-2). It will attack the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction, displacing the iodide ion (I⁻).\n\nThis reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond, attaching a methyl group (-CH₃) to the C-2 position of the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\nStarting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, we have added a methyl group at the C-2 position. The name of the resulting compound is determined by listing the substituents on the benzamide parent structure in alphabetical order.\n*   Substituents on the ring: `dimethylamino` (at C-3) and `methyl` (at C-2). Alphabetically, 'd' comes before 'm'.\n*   Substituents on the amide nitrogen: `N,N-diethyl`.\n\nThe final product is **N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reagent Recognition**: Recognizing that sec-BuLi/TMEDA is a reagent system for Directed ortho-Metalation is crucial.\n2.  **DMG Hierarchy**: It is important to know the relative strengths of Directing Metalation Groups. The amide group (-CONR₂) is significantly more powerful than the amino group (-NR₂).\n3.  **Synergistic Effects**: When a site is ortho to two DMGs, it becomes exceptionally activated. This cooperative effect often leads to very high regioselectivity, as seen in this example at the C-2 position.\n4.  **Reaction Sequence**: The reaction is a two-step sequence. First, a nucleophile is generated using a strong base. Second, the nucleophile is \"quenched\" with an electrophile. This is a common and powerful strategy in organic synthesis.\n5.  **IUPAC Nomenclature**: Ensure the final name is written correctly according to IUPAC rules, especially concerning the alphabetical ordering of substituents.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
