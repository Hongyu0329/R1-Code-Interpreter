    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the parametric curve definition**\n\nThe curve is defined in two pieces based on the value of the parameter `t`.\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $b=1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first part of the curve**\n\nFor $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n*   These equations satisfy the relation $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   Let's check the range of `t`:\n    *   At $t=0$, the point is $(x,y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi/2$, the point is $(x,y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi$, the point is $(x,y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   Since $\\sin t \\ge 0$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the unit circle.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second part of the curve**\n\nFor $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n*   These equations satisfy the relation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5.\n*   Let's check the range of `t`:\n    *   As $t$ approaches $\\pi$ from the right ($t \\to \\pi^+$), the point approaches $(\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$, connecting to the end of the first part.\n    *   At $t=3\\pi/2$, the point is $(x,y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n    *   As $t$ approaches $2\\pi$ from the left ($t \\to 2\\pi^-$), the point approaches $(\\cos 2\\pi, 5\\sin 2\\pi) = (1, 0)$, connecting to the start of the first part.\n*   Since $\\sin t < 0$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, this part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the bounding box of the complete figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates, which define a bounding rectangle.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:** The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The range of $\\cos t$ over a full period is $[-1, 1]$. So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$. The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-coordinates:** We need to consider both parts of the curve.\n    *   For the top semi-circle ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$. The values of y range from 0 to 1. So, the maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   For the bottom semi-ellipse ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5\\sin t$. Since $\\sin t$ ranges from -1 to 0 in this interval, the values of y range from -5 to 0. So, the minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n*   Combining both parts, the y-coordinates for the entire figure range from -5 to 1. The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the dimensions and area of the smallest enclosing square**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle with a width of 2 and a height of 6.\n*   To enclose this rectangle, a square must have a side length at least as large as the larger of the rectangle's dimensions.\n*   The required side length of the square is $s = \\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n*   The area of this smallest enclosing square is $Area = s^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
