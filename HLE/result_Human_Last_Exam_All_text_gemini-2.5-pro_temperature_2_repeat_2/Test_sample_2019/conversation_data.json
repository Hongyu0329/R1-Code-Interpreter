    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Constraints\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around from top to bottom and from left to right.\n*   **Pieces:** 4 queens.\n*   **Constraint:** The queens must be \"non-attacking\".\n\nOn a toroidal board of size N x N, two queens at positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if any of the following conditions are met:\n1.  **Row attack:** `r1 = r2`\n2.  **Column attack:** `c1 = c2`\n3.  **Diagonal attack:** This is where the toroidal nature is important.\n    *   ` (r1 + c1) mod N = (r2 + c2) mod N `\n    *   ` (r1 - c1) mod N = (r2 - c2) mod N `\n\nFor our problem, N=5 and we are placing k=4 queens. Let the positions of the four queens be `(r_i, c_i)` for `i = 1, 2, 3, 4`. The non-attacking condition requires that for any pair of distinct queens `i` and `j`:\n*   The four row indices `{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4}` must be distinct.\n*   The four column indices `{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}` must be distinct.\n*   The four sum-diagonal indices `{(r_1+c_1) mod 5, ..., (r_4+c_4) mod 5}` must be distinct.\n*   The four diff-diagonal indices `{(r_1-c_1) mod 5, ..., (r_4-c_4) mod 5}` must be distinct.\n\n### Step 2: Transform the Coordinates\n\nThis problem is simplified by a change of coordinates. Let:\n*   `u_i = (r_i + c_i) mod 5`\n*   `v_i = (r_i - c_i) mod 5`\n\nSince 5 is a prime number, we can uniquely determine `(r_i, c_i)` from `(u_i, v_i)`:\n*   `u_i + v_i = 2r_i (mod 5)`  => `r_i = 3(u_i + v_i) mod 5` (since `3` is the inverse of `2` mod `5`)\n*   `u_i - v_i = 2c_i (mod 5)`  => `c_i = 3(u_i - v_i) mod 5`\n\nThe problem now is to find the number of sets of 4 pairs `{(u_1, v_1), (u_2, v_2), (u_3, v_3), (u_4, v_4)}` such that the following four sets each contain 4 distinct values:\n1.  `{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4}`\n2.  `{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4}`\n3.  `{r_i} = {3(u_i+v_i) mod 5}` which simplifies to `{u_i+v_i mod 5}` being distinct.\n4.  `{c_i} = {3(u_i-v_i) mod 5}` which simplifies to `{u_i-v_i mod 5}` being distinct.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Possibilities\n\nLet `U = {u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4}` and `V = {v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4}`. `U` and `V` are 4-element subsets of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. Our task is to find the number of ways to form pairs `(u_i, v_i)` that satisfy the conditions.\n\n1.  **Choose the sets U and V:**\n    *   The number of ways to choose the 4-element set `U` from `{0,1,2,3,4}` is `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n    *   The number of ways to choose the 4-element set `V` from `{0,1,2,3,4}` is `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n    This gives `5 * 5 = 25` possible pairs of sets `(U, V)`.\n\n2.  **Count valid pairings (bijections) for a specific (U, V):**\n    Let's fix a choice for `U` and `V`. For instance, let `U = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and `V = {0, 1, 2, 3}`. We need to find the number of bijections (permutations) `σ: U -> V` such that `{u + σ(u)}` and `{u - σ(u)}` are also sets of 4 distinct values.\n    *   Let `u_miss` be the element not in `U` and `v_miss` be the element not in `V`. Here, `u_miss = 4` and `v_miss = 4`.\n    *   The sum of elements in `U` is `0+1+2+3=6`. The sum of all elements in `{0,1,2,3,4}` is `10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5`. So, `sum(U) \\equiv -u_miss \\pmod 5`.\n    *   The set of sums `{u + σ(u)}` must have 4 distinct values. Its missing element `s_miss` will be `s_miss \\equiv u_miss + v_miss \\pmod 5`. For our case, `s_miss = 4+4=8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5`.\n    *   The set of differences `{u - σ(u)}` must also have 4 distinct values. Its missing element `d_miss` will be `d_miss \\equiv u_miss - v_miss \\pmod 5`. For our case, `d_miss = 4-4 = 0 \\pmod 5`.\n    *   So, we need to find permutations `σ` of `{0, 1, 2, 3}` such that for `i \\in {0,1,2,3}`:\n        a. `i + σ(i) \\not\\equiv 3 \\pmod 5`\n        b. `i - σ(i) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 5`, which implies `σ(i) ≠ i`. The permutation must be a **derangement**.\n\n    There are `!4 = 9` derangements of 4 elements. We test them:\n    *   `σ = (1, 0, 3, 2)`: Sums `{1, 1, 0, 0}` (fails, not distinct).\n    *   `σ = (1, 2, 3, 0)`: Sums `{1, 3, 0, 3}` (fails, not distinct). Check condition (a): `1+σ(1)=1+2=3`. Fails.\n    *   `σ = (1, 3, 0, 2)`: Sums `{1, 4, 2, 0}` (distinct, ok). Differences `{-1, -2, 2, 1} \\equiv \\{4, 3, 2, 1\\}` (distinct, ok). **This is a valid solution.**\n    *   `σ = (2, 0, 3, 1)`: Sums `{2, 1, 0, 4}` (distinct, ok). Differences `{-2, 1, -1, 2} \\equiv \\{3, 1, 4, 2\\}` (distinct, ok). **This is a valid solution.**\n    *   `σ = (2, 3, 0, 1)`: Sums `{2, 4, 2, 4}` (fails, not distinct).\n    *   `σ = (2, 3, 1, 0)`: Sums `{2, 4, 3, 3}` (fails, not distinct). Check condition (a): `2+σ(2)=2+1=3`. Fails.\n    *   `σ = (3, 0, 1, 2)`: Check condition (a): `0+σ(0)=0+3=3`. Fails.\n    *   `σ = (3, 2, 0, 1)`: Check condition (a): `0+σ(0)=0+3=3`. Fails.\n    *   `σ = (3, 2, 1, 0)`: Check condition (a): `0+σ(0)=0+3=3`. Fails.\n\n    For the specific case `U=V={0,1,2,3}`, we find exactly **2** valid bijections.\n\n### Step 4: Generalize and Calculate Final Answer\n\nThe number of valid bijections is independent of the choice of `U` and `V`. This is because the group of translations on the toroidal board `(r, c) -> (r+a, c+b)` can transform any pair of missing elements `(u_miss, v_miss)` to any other pair `(u'_miss, v'_miss)`. Therefore, the number of valid pairings is 2 for every one of the 25 choices of `(U, V)`.\n\nThe total number of ways is the product of the number of choices for `U`, the number of choices for `V`, and the number of valid bijections for each pair `(U, V)`.\n\nTotal Ways = (Ways to choose U) × (Ways to choose V) × (Number of valid bijections)\nTotal Ways = 5 × 5 × 2 = 50\n\nEach of these 50 valid constructions corresponds to a unique set of 4 queen positions on the board.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
