    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: State the Equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous fluid. For a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and a pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, where $(t, \\mathbf{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\rho$ is the constant density (which can be set to 1 without loss of generality by rescaling pressure) and $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We are looking for the symmetries of this system of partial differential equations.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding Lie Group Symmetries\n\nA Lie group of symmetries of a system of differential equations is a continuous group of transformations acting on the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that maps any solution of the system to another solution. The dimension of this Lie group is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, which consists of the infinitesimal generators of these symmetry transformations.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Pressure Term and a Critical Point\n\nA complete analysis of the symmetry conditions (the \"determining equations\") reveals a special feature. The pressure $p$ only appears in the momentum equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This implies that if we transform the pressure according to $p \\mapsto p + \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, the momentum equation remains invariant as long as $\\nabla \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, t) = 0$. For this to hold for any $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, the function $\\phi$ must be a function of time only, i.e., $\\phi = g(t)$.\n\nThis leads to a family of symmetry transformations $p \\mapsto p + g(t)$ for any arbitrary smooth function $g(t)$. The infinitesimal generators for these transformations are $g(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$. Since $g(t)$ can be any function, this constitutes an infinite-dimensional space of generators.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The full Lie algebra of point symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. Therefore, strictly speaking, the dimension of the Lie group is infinite.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Maximal Finite-Dimensional Symmetry Group\n\nIn many contexts, especially when the term \"Lie group\" is used without further qualification, it is implied to be finite-dimensional. Questions about the \"dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\" often refer to the dimension of the maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra of the full symmetry algebra. The infinite-dimensional part, related here to the pressure, is often considered a \"trivial\" or \"gauge\" freedom and is factored out.\n\nLet's identify the generators of this maximal finite-dimensional algebra. This algebra consists of symmetries that are fundamental to the physics of the problem, along with any other symmetries that close into a finite-dimensional algebra.\n\n### Step 5: Listing the Generators of the Finite-Dimensional Algebra\n\nThe systematic derivation yields the following set of generators which form a 12-dimensional Lie algebra, denoted $\\mathfrak{g}_{12}$:\n\n1.  **Time translation (1 dimension):** The equations are autonomous (no explicit time dependence).\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$\n\n2.  **Space translations (3 dimensions):** The equations are invariant under shifting the spatial origin.\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$\n\n3.  **Spatial rotations (3 dimensions):** The equations are covariant under rotations ($SO(3)$ group).\n    *   Generators: $R_{ij} = x_j \\partial_{x_i} - x_i \\partial_{x_j} + u_j \\partial_{u_i} - u_i \\partial_{u_j}$ for $(i,j) \\in \\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)\\}$\n\n4.  **Galilean boosts (3 dimensions):** Invariance under shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n    *   Generators: $G_i = t \\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$\n\n5.  **Scaling (or Dilation) (1 dimension):** The equations are invariant under a specific scaling of all variables.\n    *   Transformation: $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p) \\mapsto (\\lambda^2 t, \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\lambda^{-2} p)$\n    *   Generator: $D = 2t\\partial_t + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \\partial_{x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \\partial_{u_i} - 2p \\partial_p$\n\n6.  **Constant Pressure Shift (1 dimension):** As a special case of the infinite pressure symmetries, a constant shift $p \\mapsto p+c$ is a symmetry.\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_p$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This set of 12 generators forms a closed Lie algebra. Adding any other generator from the infinite-dimensional part (e.g., $t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$) and taking commutators with the existing generators (especially the scaling generator $D$) would generate an infinite number of new generators. Thus, this 12-dimensional algebra is the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry subalgebra.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion on the Dimension\n\nThe total number of generators in the maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of symmetries is:\n$1 (\\text{time trans.}) + 3 (\\text{space trans.}) + 3 (\\text{rotations}) + 3 (\\text{boosts}) + 1 (\\text{scaling}) + 1 (\\text{pressure shift}) = 12$.\n\nAssuming the question follows the standard convention of asking for the dimension of this maximal finite-dimensional group, the dimension is 12. This is the commonly cited value in the literature on the subject."
