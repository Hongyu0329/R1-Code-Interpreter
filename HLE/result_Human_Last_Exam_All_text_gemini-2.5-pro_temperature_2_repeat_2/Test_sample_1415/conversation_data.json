    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\nThe problem asks us to evaluate the definite integral:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integrand, `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)`, is a specific form. Let's solve the indefinite integral first. We can use a u-substitution.\nLet `u = F₃(x)`.\nThen `du = F₃'(x) dx`.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral gives:\n∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + C\n\nSubstituting back `u = F₃(x)`, we get:\n∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)| + C\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Limits of Integration**\nNow we evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1 using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, this can be written as:\nV = ln( |F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)| )\n\n**Step 3: Define and Evaluate F₃(x) at x=0 and x=1**\nWe need to find the expressions for F₃(0) and F₃(1). Let's follow the chain of definitions:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\nNow, let's evaluate F₃(x) at the limits:\n*   At x = 0:\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n*   At x = 1:\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 4: Check the Sign of F₃(x)**\nBefore calculating the value, we need to handle the absolute value signs. Let's determine if F₃(x) is positive or negative on the interval [0, 1].\n*   On the interval [0, 1] (in radians), `sin(x)` ranges from `sin(0)=0` to `sin(1)≈0.84`. So, `sin(x) ≥ 0`.\n*   Since `sin(x) ≥ 0`, `e^(sin(x))` will be greater than or equal to `e⁰ = 1`.\n*   Therefore, `1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   The natural logarithm of a number greater than or equal to 2 is positive. Thus, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) ≥ ln(2) > 0` for all x in [0, 1].\n*   Since F₃(x) is always positive on this interval, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final value V**\nOur expression for V becomes:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation:\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.3197771\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + 2.3197771) = ln(3.3197771) ≈ 1.2001157\n*   F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931472\n*   V ≈ ln(1.2001157) - ln(0.6931472)\n*   V ≈ 0.1824169 - (-0.3665129)\n*   V ≈ 0.5489298\n\n**Step 6: Report the Required Value**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n*   10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.5489298 = 5489.298\n*   The closest integer to 5489.298 is 5489.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
