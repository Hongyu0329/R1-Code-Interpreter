    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the core concept: \"Reverse Turn\" and \"Overturning\".**\n    *   A **Reverse Turn** is a standard figure in all five of the listed Ballroom dances, characterized by a turn to the left.\n    *   **Overturning** means rotating more than the technically prescribed amount. For example, a standard Reverse Turn in Waltz or Foxtrot has 3/4 of a turn over the first three steps. Overturning would be attempting to make a full 360-degree turn in those same three steps.\n\n2.  **Understand the constraint: \"without disregarding the technique\".**\n    *   This is the most crucial part of the question. It means we must adhere strictly to the foundational principles and characteristic actions of each specific dance. These principles include footwork, rise and fall, body sway, Contra Body Movement (CBM), and the overall quality of movement (e.g., smooth vs. staccato).\n    *   The question asks in which dance the act of overturning *inherently forces* you to break these fundamental rules, making it technically \"impossible.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze each dance based on its technique:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:**\n        *   These four dances are often grouped as \"swing dances.\" Their technique is built upon principles of CBM (Contra Body Movement), body sway, and continuous, flowing movement where the feet swing and pass each other to travel down the floor.\n        *   In these dances, a Reverse Turn is initiated with CBM. To overturn the turn, a dancer would need to exaggerate the CBM and body rotation.\n        *   While overturning is considered very poor technique—it would likely ruin the dancer's balance, posture, and alignment, and is heavily penalized in competition—it is not technically *impossible*. The dancer would still be using the core mechanics of the dance (CBM, swing, passing feet), just in an uncontrolled and exaggerated way. It is a flaw in the *degree* of an action, not a violation of the fundamental *type* of action.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:**\n        *   The European Tango has a unique and strict technique that sets it apart from the swing dances.\n        *   **Key Technical Points of Tango:**\n            1.  **No CBM:** Rotation is generated by a twist or swivel of the body over the standing leg, not by moving the body contrary to the moving foot.\n            2.  **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is performed on a level plane with bent knees, giving it a stealthy, \"stalking\" look.\n            3.  **No Sway:** The torso is held strong and still, without inclination.\n            4.  **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp and clipped, not smooth and flowing.\n            5.  **Non-Passing Feet on Turns:** On a typical Tango reverse turn, the feet do not swing past each other. The turn is a pivot. For the Man's Reverse Turn, step 3 is \"Left foot closes to Right foot without weight.\"\n        *   **Applying this to Overturning:** To achieve more rotation than the prescribed amount in a Tango Reverse Turn (which is typically about 1/2 to 5/8 of a turn), a dancer would be *forced* to violate these core principles. They would need to introduce body sway for balance, use CBM to generate more rotational power, and let the feet swing past each other instead of closing them. The action of closing the foot without weight on step 3 physically limits the amount of possible rotation. Any attempt to rotate further would necessitate changing that step into a stepping-past action, which is a fundamental breach of Tango's turning technique.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, overturning a reverse turn is a severe technical *error* but uses an exaggeration of the dances' existing mechanics. In Tango, overturning it is technically *impossible* because it requires introducing actions (sway, CBM, passing feet) that are fundamentally contrary to the defined technique of the dance. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango reverse turn without completely disregarding its technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
