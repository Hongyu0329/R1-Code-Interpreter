    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe user is asking for the specific name of the \"value between heartbeats\" which is captured as a \"beat-to-beat interval\" to compute HRV. The measurement technology mentioned is PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n\n*   **Core concept:** Time interval between consecutive heartbeats.\n*   **Purpose:** To calculate HRV.\n*   **Technology:** PPG.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points & Relevant Terminology**\nTo find the correct term, we must consider the different terminologies used in cardiovascular monitoring.\n\n1.  **Source of the Term:** The terminology for HRV originates from Electrocardiography (ECG), which is the clinical gold standard for measuring the heart's electrical activity. In an ECG waveform, the most prominent spike, representing ventricular depolarization, is called the \"R-wave\".\n2.  **ECG-based Term:** The time measured between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**. This is the most common and foundational term in HRV literature.\n3.  **PPG-based Term:** The question specifies that PPG is used. PPG does not measure electrical activity but rather changes in blood volume. The waveform has peaks that correspond to the heart's pulse. The time between these consecutive peaks can be called the **Peak-to-Peak (P-P) interval**.\n4.  **Generic Term:** A more general term that is independent of the measurement technology (ECG, PPG, etc.) is the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**. It simply means the time interval between any two consecutive heartbeats.\n5.  **Filtered Term for Analysis:** For accurate HRV analysis, raw intervals are often processed to remove outliers caused by arrhythmias or measurement errors (artifacts). The resulting clean intervals, representing the time between consecutive \"normal\" sinus rhythm beats, are called **Normal-to-Normal (NN) intervals**. Most HRV metrics (like SDNN, RMSSD) are calculated from this series of NN intervals.\n\n**Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer**\nNow we evaluate which term best answers the question, \"What is that value called?\"\n\n*   The question asks for the fundamental value *from which* HRV is computed. This is the raw time interval between beats.\n*   While \"P-P interval\" is technically precise for PPG and \"IBI\" is generically correct, the field of HRV is dominated by the terminology derived from the ECG gold standard.\n*   Therefore, the intervals derived from PPG are almost universally referred to as **R-R intervals** in research, clinical applications, and consumer device literature. It has become the de facto standard term for the beat-to-beat interval used in HRV, regardless of the source.\n*   Thus, while IBI and P-P interval are also correct, the most common and widely understood answer is the R-R interval.\n\n**Conclusion:** The value between heartbeats, used as the fundamental measurement for computing HRV, is most commonly known as the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
