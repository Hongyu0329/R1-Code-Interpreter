    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core task**\nThe question asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix, denoted as `A`. The context of \"Markov quiver for m_1/2 = 13\" explains the origin of the matrix but does not alter the matrix itself. The matrix is given as:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSo, the problem boils down to a standard linear algebra calculation.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method to compute the determinant**\nThere are several ways to compute the determinant of a matrix.\n*   **Method A: Using matrix properties.** This is often the quickest method if a specific property is present.\n*   **Method B: Using the cofactor expansion (or the Sarrus rule for 3x3 matrices).** This is a direct computational method.\n\n**Step 3: Execution using Method A (Matrix Properties)**\n\n1.  **Careful Point: Observe the rows (or columns) of the matrix.** A key property to check for is linear dependence. A simple test is to sum the rows or columns.\n2.  **Summing the rows:**\n    *   Row 1: [2, -1, -1]\n    *   Row 2: [-1, 2, -1]\n    *   Row 3: [-1, -1, 2]\n    *   Sum = [2 + (-1) + (-1), -1 + 2 + (-1), -1 + (-1) + 2] = [0, 0, 0]\n3.  **Careful Point: Understand the implication of linearly dependent rows.** A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that if the rows (or columns) of a square matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is 0. Since the sum of the row vectors is the zero vector (`R1 + R2 + R3 = 0`), the rows are linearly dependent.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on this property, the determinant of matrix `A` must be 0.\n\n**Step 4: Verification using Method B (Direct Computation)**\n\n1.  **Careful Point: Correctly apply the determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix.**\n    The formula is:\n    det(A) = `a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)`\n    For our matrix `A`:\n    `a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n    `d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n    `g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n2.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    det(A) = `2 * ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))`\n3.  **Careful Point: Perform the arithmetic meticulously to avoid errors.**\n    *   det(A) = `2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 - (-2))`\n    *   det(A) = `2 * (3) + 1 * (-3) - 1 * (1 + 2)`\n    *   det(A) = `6 - 3 - 1 * (3)`\n    *   det(A) = `6 - 3 - 3`\n    *   det(A) = `0`\n4.  **Conclusion:** The direct computation confirms the result from the property-based method.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nBoth methods consistently show that the determinant of the given matrix is 0. The extraneous information in the question does not change this mathematical fact.\n\n<<<0>>>"
