    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Problem:** What is the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)?$\n\n**Step 1: Initial analysis of the function `f`**\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** First, we establish that $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function. Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. Using the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ is injective.\n\n2.  **Continuity:** The problem explicitly states that $f$ must be continuous.\n\n3.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. We will analyze these two cases separately.\n\n4.  **Commutativity with `exp`:** A crucial property is that any such function $f$ must commute with $\\exp$. We can see this as follows:\n    $f(\\exp(x)) = f(f(f(x)))$.\n    $\\exp(f(x)) = f(f(f(x)))$.\n    Therefore, $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$.\n\n**Step 2: Case 1 - `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a continuous, strictly decreasing function.\n1.  As a decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its limits at infinity exist. Let $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = b$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = a$. Since $f$ is decreasing, its range is the open interval $(a, b)$, and we must have $a < b$. The value $b$ is the supremum of the range of $f$.\n\n2.  Using the commutativity property $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$, let's take the limit as $x \\to -\\infty$.\n    *   The left side: $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(\\exp(x)) = f(\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\exp(x)) = f(0)$ (by the continuity of $f$).\n    *   The right side: $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\exp(f(x)) = \\exp(\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)) = \\exp(b)$ (by the continuity of `exp`).\n    *   Equating the two results, we get $f(0) = \\exp(b)$.\n\n3.  Now, let's consider the properties of $f$. Since $f$ is strictly decreasing for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, for any $x < 0$, we have $f(x) > f(0)$.\n    As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches its limit $b$. This means $b$ is the least upper bound of the set $\\{f(x) | x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$. Therefore, we must have $b \\ge f(x)$ for all $x$. In particular, $b \\ge f(0)$. Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, it cannot be constant on any interval, so in fact $b > f(0)$.\n\n4.  Combining the results from points 2 and 3, we have $b > f(0)$ and $f(0) = \\exp(b)$. This implies the inequality $b > \\exp(b)$.\n\n5.  **Contradiction:** There is no real number $b$ for which $b > \\exp(b)$. To see this, consider the function $g(b) = b - \\exp(b)$. Its derivative is $g'(b) = 1 - \\exp(b)$, which is zero only at $b=0$. The maximum value of $g(b)$ occurs at $b=0$, and is $g(0) = 0 - \\exp(0) = -1$. Since the maximum value is -1, $b - \\exp(b)$ is always negative, so $b < \\exp(b)$ for all $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThis contradiction shows that our initial assumption was false. Therefore, there are **no** continuous strictly decreasing solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Case 2 - `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nNow, we analyze the case where $f$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function.\n1.  As an increasing function, its limits at infinity exist. Let $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = a$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = b$. The range of $f$ is $(a, b)$.\n2.  The range of $f(f(x))$ is $f((a, b))$, which is $(\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y))$.\n3.  The range of $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$. So, we must have $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$.\n    By continuity, this implies we can think of $f(a) = 0$ and that $b$ must be $\\infty$. So the range of $f$ is $(a, \\infty)$.\n4.  What is `a`? If $a=0$, then $f(0)=0$. This would mean $f(f(0)) = f(0)=0$, but $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$. This is a contradiction, so $a \\neq 0$.\n    If $a > 0$, then for all $x$, $f(x) > a > 0$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies $f(f(x)) > f(a)$. We found $f(a)=0$, but $a$ is not in the domain of $f$ unless $a=-\\infty$. This reasoning is complex, but a simpler argument shows $a$ must be negative: since $f$ is increasing and maps $\\mathbb{R}$ to $(a, \\infty)$ and $f(a)=0$, $f$ must take on values less than 0. The only way for `f(x)` to be less than 0 while having an infimum of `a` is if `a` is less than or equal to that value. Since `0` is in the range `(a, inf)`, we have `a<0`.\n5.  **Construction of Solutions:** We can construct solutions by defining $f$ on a \"fundamental\" interval and then using the functional equation to extend its definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   First, **choose a real number `a < 0`**. This `a` will be the infimum of the range of our solution `f`.\n    *   The entire structure of the function `f` is determined if we define it on the interval $[a, 0]$. Specifically, $f$ on this interval must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps $[a, 0]$ to $[0, \\exp(a)]$. (This is derived from a careful decomposition of $\\mathbb{R}$ into intervals based on the action of `f`). Let's call this piece of the function $h(x) = f(x)$ for $x \\in [a,0]$.\n    *   So, we must **choose a continuous, strictly increasing bijection `h: [a, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(a)]`**. Such a function `h` must satisfy $h(a)=0$ and $h(0)=\\exp(a)$. Once `a` and `h` are chosen, the entire function `f` on $\\mathbb{R}$ is uniquely determined.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the number of solutions**\n\nThe cardinality of the set of solutions is the number of possible valid choices we can make in the construction.\n1.  **Cardinality of choices for `a`:** The number `a` can be any real number in the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, `2^{\\aleph_0}`).\n\n2.  **Cardinality of choices for `h`:** For a fixed `a`, we need to count how many continuous, strictly increasing bijections `h` exist from $[a, 0]$ to $[0, \\exp(a)]$. This is equivalent to counting the number of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of a closed interval. This set is known to have cardinality `c`.\n    For instance, we can map `[a, 0]` to `[0, 1]` and `[0, exp(a)]` to `[0, 1]` and then count the homeomorphisms `m: [0, 1] \\to [0, 1]` with $m(0)=0, m(1)=1$. Functions like $m(p,x)=x^p$ for any $p \\in (0, \\infty)$ provide a continuum of such distinct mappings.\n\n3.  **Total Cardinality:** Every unique pair of `(a, h)` defines a unique solution `f`.\n    *   If we choose different values for `a`, say $a_1 \\neq a_2$, the resulting functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ will have different ranges, ($(a_1, \\infty)$ and $(a_2, \\infty)$), and thus must be different functions.\n    *   If we fix `a` but choose different functions $h_1 \\neq h_2$, the resulting functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ will differ on the interval $[a, 0]$ and will therefore be different.\n    The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for `a` and the number of choices for `h`.\n    Cardinality = (Number of choices for `a`) × (Number of choices for `h`)\n    Cardinality = `c × c = c`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe set of functions satisfying the condition consists only of strictly increasing functions. The construction process reveals that there is a continuum of choices available at two different stages, resulting in a total cardinality of `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (`2^{\\aleph_0}`).\n\n>>>c"
