    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Factor the polynomial:**\n    Let $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can try to rearrange and factor the polynomial.\n    Notice the pattern in the coefficients:\n    $f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n    $f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n    This attempt does not quite work. Let's try grouping different terms.\n    $f(x) = (x^7 - 9x^3) - (2x^5 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n    $f(x) = x^3(x^4-9) - 2x(x^4-9) + 3(x^2-2)$\n    $f(x) = (x^3-2x)(x^4-9) + 3(x^2-2)$\n    $f(x) = x(x^2-2)(x^2-3)(x^2+3) + 3(x^2-2)$\n    $f(x) = (x^2-2)[x(x^2-3)(x^2+3) + 3]$\n    $f(x) = (x^2-2)[x(x^4-9) + 3]$\n    $f(x) = (x^2-2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n    So, the roots of $f(x)$ are the union of the roots of $g(x) = x^2-2$ and $h(x) = x^5-9x+3$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Galois group of each factor over $\\mathbb{Q}$:**\n    *   For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$, the roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n    *   For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we check for irreducibility. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n        *   The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 3.\n        *   All other integer coefficients (-9, 0, 0, 3) are divisible by 3.\n        *   The constant term, 3, is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n        *   Thus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   To determine the Galois group of $h(x)$, let's call it $G_h$, we analyze its roots. $G_h$ is a subgroup of $S_5$. Since $h(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, $|G_h|$ is divisible by 5. By Cauchy's Theorem, $G_h$ contains a 5-cycle.\n    *   Let's find the number of real roots. The derivative is $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are given by $x^4 = 9/5$, so $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. These are two real critical points.\n    *   Evaluating $h(x)$ at the critical points:\n        *   Let $c = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. $h(c) = c(c^4-9)+3 = c(9/5 - 9) + 3 = - \\frac{36}{5}c + 3 < 0$ since $c>1$.\n        *   $h(-c) = -c(c^4-9)+3 = c(9-9/5) + 3 = \\frac{36}{5}c + 3 > 0$.\n    *   The function $h(x)$ goes from $-\\infty$, has a local maximum at $-c$ which is positive, a local minimum at $c$ which is negative, and goes to $+\\infty$. Therefore, $h(x)$ has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots. The complex conjugation acts as a transposition on the set of roots.\n    *   A subgroup of $S_5$ that contains a 5-cycle and a transposition must be $S_5$ itself. So, $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, where $K_h$ is the splitting field of $h(x)$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial:**\n    The splitting field of $f(x)$ is the compositum $K = K_g K_h$. The Galois group is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n    Since $K_g$ and $K_h$ are both normal extensions of $\\mathbb{Q}$, the group $G$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    If $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$, then $G \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    The only quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$, where $\\Delta_h$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\n    The discriminant of $x^n+px+q$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n q^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}p^n)$.\n    For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, p=-9, q=3$.\n    $\\Delta_h = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 5^5 \\cdot 3^4 - 4^4 \\cdot 9^5 = 3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049 = 253125 - 15116544 < 0$.\n    So $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$ is an imaginary quadratic field. On the other hand, $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Therefore, $K_g \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$, so $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Thus, the Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$. The order of the group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory:**\n    We are looking for the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n    According to Galois theory, these extensions $L$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$.\n    The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ corresponds to $H$ being a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$ (i.e., $H \\neq \\{e\\}$ and $H \\neq G$).\n    The degree of the extension is given by $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\n5.  **Find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$:**\n    The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n    Let's identify the normal subgroups $H$ of $G$:\n    *   **Product subgroups:** Subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd S_5$ and $N_2 \\unlhd C_2$.\n        *   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H| = 60$. $[G:H] = 240/60 = 4$.\n        *   $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H| = 120$. $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n        *   $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H| = 2$. $[G:H] = 240/2 = 120$. This subgroup is the center $Z(G)$.\n        *   $A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H| = 120$. $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   **Diagonal/Skew subgroups:** These can exist because $S_5$ has a normal subgroup $A_5$ with quotient $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$, which is isomorphic to $C_2/\\{e\\}$. This gives rise to a \"diagonal\" normal subgroup.\n        *   $D = \\{ (g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid c = \\text{sgn}(g) \\}$. Let's verify this is a normal subgroup. For $(x,y) \\in G$ and $(g, \\text{sgn}(g)) \\in D$, we check if $ (x,y)(g, \\text{sgn}(g))(x,y)^{-1} \\in D$. This is $(xgx^{-1}, y(\\text{sgn}(g))y^{-1})$. Since $C_2$ is abelian, this is $(xgx^{-1}, \\text{sgn}(g))$. We need $\\text{sgn}(xgx^{-1}) = \\text{sgn}(g)$, which is true. Thus $D$ is a normal subgroup.\n        *   The order of $D$ is $|S_5|=120$. So, $[G:D] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    A thorough analysis confirms that these are all the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\n6.  **List the possible degrees:**\n    The degrees of the normal intermediate fields are the indices of these normal subgroups. We collect the distinct values of the indices calculated above.\n    *   From $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, the degree is 4.\n    *   From $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, the degree is 2.\n    *   From $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$, the degree is 120.\n    *   From $A_5 \\times C_2$, the degree is 2.\n    *   From $D$, the degree is 2.\n    The set of all possible degrees is the set of these index values.\n\nThe possible degrees are $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
