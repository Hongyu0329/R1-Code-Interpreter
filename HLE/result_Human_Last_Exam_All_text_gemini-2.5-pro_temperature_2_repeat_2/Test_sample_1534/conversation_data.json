    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Organism:** Dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*). The brain anatomy is generally conserved across cuttlefish species, so information from the common cuttlefish (*Sepia officinalis*) is highly relevant.\n    *   **Key Landmark:** The palliovisceral lobe. This is a major component of the cephalopod brain.\n    *   **Positional Query:** \"adjacent posteriorly\". This means we need to identify the brain structures that are located directly behind (caudal to) the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n2.  **Understand the Palliovisceral Lobe:**\n    *   The cephalopod brain is divided into two main parts that wrap around the esophagus: the supraesophageal mass (above) and the subesophageal mass (below).\n    *   The palliovisceral lobe is a very large and prominent part of the **posterior subesophageal mass**.\n    *   Its name reveals its primary functions: \"pallio\" refers to the mantle, and \"visceral\" refers to the internal organs. Therefore, this lobe is the control center for mantle contraction (used for respiration and jet propulsion), operation of the gills, the ink sac, and other visceral functions.\n\n3.  **Identify Structures Posterior to the Palliovisceral Lobe:**\n    *   To determine what lies behind the palliovisceral lobe, we need to consider the motor functions controlled by the rearmost part of the cuttlefish brain.\n    *   Cuttlefish possess a pair of fins that run along the sides of their mantle. These fins are used for stabilization, hovering, and slow, intricate locomotion.\n    *   The control centers for these fins must be located in the brain, and given the posterior location of the fins themselves, it is logical that their control centers are at the posterior end of the brain.\n    *   Neuroanatomical studies of the cuttlefish brain confirm this. Situated at the very caudal (posterior) end of the subesophageal mass, just behind the large palliovisceral lobe, are the lobes that control the fins.\n\n4.  **Name the Specific Brain Regions:**\n    *   The brain regions responsible for fin control are known as the **fin lobes**.\n    *   More specifically, this system is composed of the **anterior fin lobe** and the **posterior fin lobe**. These two lobes work together to produce the rhythmic, undulating movements of the lateral fins.\n    *   Therefore, looking at a sagittal (side-view) diagram of the cuttlefish brain, one would see the large palliovisceral lobe, and positioned adjacent to its posterior and ventral-posterior surface would be the anterior and posterior fin lobes.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Brain Complexity:** The cephalopod brain is three-dimensional and wraps around the esophagus, so directional terms must be used carefully relative to the animal's body axis. \"Posterior\" refers to the direction towards the tail/apex of the mantle.\n*   **Nomenclature:** Different neuroanatomical studies might use slightly different names (e.g., \"posterior subesophageal lobes\" as a group containing the fin lobes), but \"anterior and posterior fin lobes\" are the standard, functionally descriptive terms for these specific structures.\n*   **Adjacency:** The fin lobes are not just generally in the posterior area; they are in direct physical contact with the posterior aspect of the palliovisceral lobe, fitting the \"adjacent\" criterion.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBased on the known neuroanatomy of cuttlefish, the primary brain structures located immediately posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the lobes that control fin movement. These are the anterior and posterior fin lobes.\n\n<<<The anterior fin lobe and the posterior fin lobe.>>>"
