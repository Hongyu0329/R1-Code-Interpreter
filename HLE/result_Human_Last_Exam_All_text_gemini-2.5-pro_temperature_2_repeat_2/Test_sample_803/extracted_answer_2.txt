The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(Q)` formed from any abelian group `Q` of order `q^m`. Such a group `G` is a semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ C₂` where the non-trivial element of `C₂` acts on `Q` via the inversion automorphism, `k ↦ k⁻¹` for all `k ∈ Q`.
