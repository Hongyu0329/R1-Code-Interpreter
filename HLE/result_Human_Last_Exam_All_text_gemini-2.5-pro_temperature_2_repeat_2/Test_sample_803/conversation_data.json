    "This problem asks for the classification of all nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the definitions**\n\n*   **Product-free set (S):** A subset `S ⊂ G` is product-free if for any `x, y ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), the product `xy` is not in `S`. This implies `x^2 ∉ S` for any `x ∈ S`, and `e ∉ S`.\n*   **Maximal by inclusion product-free set (M):** An M is a product-free set such that for any element `g ∈ G \\ M`, the set `M ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **A set S fills G:** A subset `S ⊂ G` fills G if `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {e}`, where `S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is filled if *every* maximal by inclusion product-free set in `G` fills `G`.\n\n**Step 2: Use a known characterization of filled groups**\n\nA crucial theorem simplifies the problem significantly. A finite group `G` is filled if and only if it satisfies the **square-root property (SR)**:\n> For every element `g ∈ G \\ {e}`, either `g` is an involution (i.e., `g² = e`) or `g` has a square root in `G` (i.e., there exists `x ∈ G` such that `x² = g`).\n\nWe will use this property to classify the groups in question.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of a group G of order `2q^m`**\n\nLet `|G| = 2q^m`, with `q` being an odd prime.\n*   By Sylow's Theorems, let `n_q` be the number of Sylow q-subgroups. `n_q` must divide 2 and satisfy `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`.\n    *   If `n_q = 2`, then `2 ≡ 1 (mod q)`, which implies `q` divides `1`. This is impossible for a prime `q`.\n    *   Therefore, `n_q = 1`. This means there is a unique Sylow q-subgroup, which we call `Q`. A unique Sylow subgroup is always a normal subgroup. So, `Q ⊲ G` and `|Q| = q^m`.\n*   Let `P` be a Sylow 2-subgroup. `|P| = 2`. So, `P = {e, a}` for some element `a` with `a² = e`. `P` is isomorphic to `C₂`, the cyclic group of order 2.\n*   Since `Q` is a normal subgroup, and `P` is a subgroup whose order is coprime to `|Q|`, `G` is a **semidirect product** of `Q` and `P`. We write this as `G = Q ⋊ P` or `G = Q ⋊ C₂`.\n*   The group `G` is specified by a homomorphism `φ: P → Aut(Q)`, where `Aut(Q)` is the group of automorphisms of `Q`. Let `a` be the non-identity element of `P`. The action of `a` on `Q` by conjugation is given by `φ(a)`, which we will call `α`. So, for any `k ∈ Q`, we have `aka⁻¹ = α(k)`.\n*   The problem states `G` is nonabelian. This means the semidirect product is not a direct product, so the homomorphism `φ` must be non-trivial. This means `α` is not the identity automorphism of `Q`. Since `a² = e`, the automorphism `α` must have order 2 (`α²` is the identity automorphism).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the square-root property (SR) to G**\n\nThe elements of `G` are partitioned into two sets: the elements of the subgroup `Q` and the elements of the coset `Qa = {ka | k ∈ Q}`.\n\n*   **Case 1: Elements `g ∈ Q \\ {e}`**\n    An element `g ∈ Q` has order `q^k` for some `1 ≤ k ≤ m`. Since `q` is an odd prime, the order of `g` is odd. Thus, `g² ≠ e`, so `g` is not an involution.\n    For the (SR) property to hold, `g` must have a square root in `G`.\n    Let's check if it has a square root in `Q`. The mapping `f: Q → Q` defined by `f(x) = x²` is a permutation of the finite set `Q` because `|Q|` is odd (if `x² = y²`, then `(xy⁻¹)²=e`, which implies `xy⁻¹=e` as `Q` has no elements of order 2). Therefore, `f` is surjective, and every element `g ∈ Q` has a unique square root `x` that is also in `Q`.\n    So, all elements in `Q` satisfy the (SR) property, irrespective of the structure of `Q` or the nature of the automorphism `α`.\n\n*   **Case 2: Elements `g ∈ Qa`**\n    Let `g = ka` for some `k ∈ Q`. For `g` to satisfy the (SR) property, it must either be an involution or have a square root.\n    Let's check if `g` can have a square root `x ∈ G`.\n    - If `x ∈ Q`, then `x² ∈ Q`. But `g = ka ∉ Q`. So `x` cannot be in `Q`.\n    - If `x ∈ Qa`, let `x = ja` for some `j ∈ Q`. Then `x² = (ja)² = j(aja⁻¹)a² = jα(j)e = jα(j)`. The element `jα(j)` is in `Q`. But `g = ka ∉ Q`. So `x` cannot be in `Qa` either.\n    This shows that **no element in the coset `Qa` can have a square root.**\n    For the (SR) property to hold for the whole group `G`, every element `g ∈ Qa` must be an involution.\n\n**Step 5: Deduce the specific structure of G**\n\nThe condition from Step 4 is that `g² = e` for all `g ∈ Qa`.\nLet `g = ka` where `k` is any element of `Q`.\n`g² = (ka)² = k(aka⁻¹)a² = kα(k)e = kα(k)`.\nSo, we must have `kα(k) = e` for all `k ∈ Q`. This implies `α(k) = k⁻¹` for all `k ∈ Q`.\nThe automorphism `α` induced by conjugation must be the **inversion map**.\n\nFor the inversion map `α(k) = k⁻¹` to be a valid automorphism of `Q`, the following must hold for all `k₁, k₂ ∈ Q`:\n`α(k₁k₂) = α(k₁)α(k₂)`\n`(k₁k₂)⁻¹ = k₁⁻¹k₂⁻¹`\n`k₂⁻¹k₁⁻¹ = k₁⁻¹k₂⁻¹`\nMultiplying by `k₂` and `k₁` on both sides gives `k₁k₂ = k₂k₁`.\nThis means the group `Q` must be **abelian**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA nonabelian group `G` of order `2q^m` is filled if and only if it has the following structure:\n1.  `G` is a semidirect product `Q ⋊ C₂`.\n2.  `Q` is an **abelian** group of order `q^m`.\n3.  The non-identity element of `C₂` acts on `Q` by inversion, i.e., `a⋅k = k⁻¹` for all `k ∈ Q`.\n\nThis specific construction is known as the **generalized dihedral group over Q**, denoted `Dih(Q)`. The isomorphism class of `Dih(Q)` is determined uniquely by the isomorphism class of the abelian group `Q`.\n\nThe possible structures for `Q` are given by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups. `Q` is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups:\n`C_{q^{m₁}} × C_{q^{m₂}} × ... × C_{q^{m_k}}` where `m₁ + m₂ + ... + m_k = m`.\nThe number of non-isomorphic groups of this type is the number of partitions of `m`.\n\nFinal answer will state this characterization.\n\n***\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are precisely the **generalized dihedral groups** `Dih(Q)`, where `Q` is any **abelian group** of order `q^m`.\n\nA group `G` is in this family if and only if it is isomorphic to a semidirect product `Q ⋊ C₂`, where:\n1.  `Q` is an abelian group of order `q^m`.\n2.  `C₂` is the cyclic group of order 2.\n3.  The non-trivial element of `C₂` acts on `Q` by sending every element `k ∈ Q` to its inverse `k⁻¹`.\n\nThese are all the nonabelian groups of this order that satisfy the property that every element is either an involution or has a square root.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(Q)` formed from any abelian group `Q` of order `q^m`. Such a group `G` is a semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ C₂` where the non-trivial element of `C₂` acts on `Q` via the inversion automorphism, `k ↦ k⁻¹` for all `k ∈ Q`.>>>"
