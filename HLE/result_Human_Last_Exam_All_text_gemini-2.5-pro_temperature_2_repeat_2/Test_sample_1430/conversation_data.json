    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the variety and the Neron-Severi group.**\nLet C be a genus 3 Riemann surface (a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus $g=3$ over $\\mathbb{C}$).\nLet X be its 15th symmetric power, $X = C^{(15)} = Sym^{15}(C)$. This is the variety of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\nThe Neron-Severi group of a variety Y, denoted $NS(Y)$, is the group of divisor classes on Y modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated abelian group. Its rank is called the Picard number of Y, denoted $\\rho(Y)$. For a smooth complex projective variety, $\\rho(Y) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} (H^{1,1}(Y) \\cap H^2(Y, \\mathbb{Q}))$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to the Jacobian of C.**\nThere is a fundamental relationship between the symmetric powers of a curve and its Jacobian variety. Let $J(C)$ be the Jacobian of C, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$.\nFor a curve C of genus g, and an integer $d > 2g-2$, the d-th symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian $J(C)$. The map is the Abel-Jacobi map $u: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ sending a divisor $D$ to the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D - d \\cdot P_0)$ for a fixed base point $P_0 \\in C$. The fibers of this map are projective spaces of dimension $d-g$.\nIn our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. The condition $d > 2g-2$ becomes $15 > 2(3)-2=4$, which is satisfied. So, $X=C^{(15)}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{15-3} = \\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over $J(C)$.\n\nFor such a projective bundle structure, the Neron-Severi group of the total space is related to the Neron-Severi group of the base. It is a standard result that:\n$NS(C^{(d)}) \\cong NS(J(C)) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$\nThis isomorphism comes from the fact that any divisor on $C^{(d)}$ is the sum of a pullback of a divisor from $J(C)$ and a multiple of a canonical divisor on $C^{(d)}$ (the relative hyperplane bundle class for the fibration). Taking the ranks of these finitely generated abelian groups, we get:\n$\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the possible range for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian.**\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, where C is any genus 3 curve. $J(C)$ is a principally polarized abelian threefold.\nThe Picard number $\\rho(J(C))$ is bounded.\n$1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le h^{1,1}(J(C))$.\nFor an abelian variety of dimension g, the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$ is $g^2$. Here $g=3$, so $h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9$.\nTherefore, for any genus 3 curve C, we have $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 9$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the smallest possible rank, $\\rho_{min}(J(C))$.**\nThe minimum value $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$ is achieved for a *generic* curve C. For a generic curve of genus g, the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian is just $\\mathbb{Z}$, $End(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), so $NS(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and its rank is 1. The existence of such curves for any $g \\geq 1$ is a classical result.\nSo, the smallest possible rank is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the largest possible rank, $\\rho_{max}(J(C))$.**\nThe maximum possible value is $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$. This value is achieved if and only if every Hodge class of type (1,1) is algebraic. This occurs for certain very special curves with extra symmetries or whose Jacobians have complex multiplication (CM).\nSpecifically, if the Jacobian $J(C)$ is isogenous to a product of 3 copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, i.e., $J(C) \\sim E^3$ where $E$ has CM, then its Picard number is maximal. The endomorphism algebra $End^0(J(C))$ is isomorphic to the matrix algebra $M_3(K)$, where $K$ is the CM field of $E$. The dimension of the space of algebraic cycles is then maximized.\nAn example of such a curve is the Klein quartic, given by the equation $x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0$. Its Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve with $j$-invariant 8000 and complex multiplication by $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$. For this curve, it is known that $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\nSo, the largest possible rank is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the smallest and largest ranks for X.**\nUsing the formula from Step 2, $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$:\n*   The **smallest** possible rank of $NS(X)$ is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   The **largest** possible rank of $NS(X)$ is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$."
