    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the manifold and its fundamental group\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot, $3_1$. Let $\\mathcal{K} = \\tau_5(K)$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which is a knotted 2-sphere in $S^4$. Let $N$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ with branch locus $\\mathcal{K}$. We want to find the minimal number of generators for $\\pi_1(N)$, denoted $d(\\pi_1(N))$.\n\nThe fundamental group of the double branched cover, $\\pi_1(N)$, can be computed from the fundamental group of the knot complement, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\mathcal{K})$. The presentation of $\\pi_1(N)$ is obtained from a presentation for $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\mathcal{K})$ by adding a single relation, $\\mu^2 = 1$, where $\\mu$ is a meridian of the knotted surface $\\mathcal{K}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the fundamental group of the knot complement\nThe fundamental group of the complement of the $n$-twist-spun knot $\\tau_n(K)$, let's call it $H_n(K) = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_n(K))$, is known in terms of the fundamental group of the original knot, $G_K = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$.\n\n$H_n(K)$ has a presentation of the form $\\langle G_K, t \\mid t g t^{-1} = \\phi_n(g), \\forall g \\in G_K \\rangle$, where:\n-   $t$ is a generator representing a meridian loop around the surface $\\mathcal{K}$.\n-   $\\phi_n: G_K \\to G_K$ is an automorphism of the knot group induced by the $n$ twists. This automorphism is conjugation by the $n$-th power of a meridian of $K$. Let's denote a meridian of $K$ in $S^3$ by $\\mu_K$. Then $\\phi_n(g) = \\mu_K^n \\, g \\, \\mu_K^{-n}$.\n\nFor this problem, $K$ is the trefoil knot ($3_1$) and $n=5$.\nThe fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement is $G_{3_1}$. A common presentation is the braid group $B_3$: $G_{3_1} = \\langle x, y \\mid xyx = yxy \\rangle$. Here, $x$ and $y$ can be chosen to be meridional generators. We will let $\\mu_K = x$.\n\nSo, the automorphism is $\\phi_5(g) = x^5 g x^{-5}$ for $g \\in G_{3_1}$.\nThe group of the complement of our 2-knot $\\mathcal{K}$ is:\n$H = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\mathcal{K}) = \\langle x, y, t \\mid xyx = yxy, \\, t x t^{-1} = x^5 x x^{-5}, \\, t y t^{-1} = x^5 y x^{-5} \\rangle$.\nThe second relation simplifies to $txt^{-1} = x$, so $[t,x]=1$ (t commutes with x).\nThe presentation for $H$ is $\\langle x, y, t \\mid xyx=yxy, [t,x], tyt^{-1}=x^5yx^{-5} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the fundamental group of the branched cover\nLet $\\Gamma = \\pi_1(N)$. As stated in Step 1, we obtain a presentation for $\\Gamma$ by adding the relation $t^2 = 1$ (since $t$ is a meridian for $\\mathcal{K}$).\n$\\Gamma = \\langle x, y, t \\mid xyx = yxy, [t,x], tyt^{-1} = x^5yx^{-5}, t^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the group structure of $\\Gamma$\nThe relation $tyt^{-1}=x^5yx^{-5}$ along with $t^2=1$ (so $t=t^{-1}$) implies $tyt=x^5yx^{-5}$.\nLet $\\phi: G_{3_1} \\to G_{3_1}$ be the automorphism defined by $\\phi(g) = tgt^{-1}$. From the relations, $\\phi(x)=x$ and $\\phi(y)=x^5yx^{-5}$.\nSince $t^2=1$, the group $\\Gamma$ has the structure of a semidirect product: $\\Gamma \\cong G_{3_1} \\rtimes_\\phi \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the abelianization of $\\Gamma$ to find a lower bound on d($\\Gamma$)\nThe number of generators of a group is always greater than or equal to the number of generators of its abelianization.\nLet's find $\\Gamma^{ab} = \\Gamma/[\\Gamma, \\Gamma]$.\nThe relations become:\n1.  $[x,y]=1$\n2.  $[t,x]=1$\n3.  $[t,y]=1, y=x^5yx^{-5} \\Rightarrow y=y$\n4.  $t^2=1$\n5.  $xyx=yxy \\Rightarrow x^2y=y^2x \\Rightarrow xy=yx$. In the abelianization of a knot group, all meridians become equal. Thus, $\\bar{x}=\\bar{y}$. Let's call this generator $\\alpha$.\nSo, $\\Gamma^{ab}$ is generated by $\\alpha$ (from $G_{3_1}^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$) and $\\bar{t}$ (from $\\mathbb{Z}_2$). The relations are that $\\alpha$ and $\\bar{t}$ commute and $\\bar{t}^2=1$.\nThus, $\\Gamma^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is 2. (For instance, $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$).\nTherefore, $d(\\Gamma) \\ge d(\\Gamma^{ab}) = 2$.\n\n### Step 6: Find a set of generators for $\\Gamma$\nWe know $d(\\Gamma)$ is at least 2. The presentation for $\\Gamma$ has 3 generators ($x,y,t$), so $d(\\Gamma) \\le 3$.\nLet's try to find a set of two generators. Let's test the set $\\{x, yt\\}$.\nLet $S = \\langle x, yt \\rangle$ be the subgroup generated by these two elements.\n1.  $x \\in S$.\n2.  Consider the conjugate of $x$ by $yt$:\n    $(yt) x (yt)^{-1} = y (t x t^{-1}) y^{-1}$.\n    Since $[t,x]=1$, we have $txt^{-1} = x$.\n    So $(yt) x (yt)^{-1} = y x y^{-1}$. Thus, $yxy^{-1} \\in S$.\n3.  We now have $x \\in S$ and $yxy^{-1} \\in S$.\n    $x$ is a meridian generator of the trefoil group $G_{3_1}$.\n    The element $yxy^{-1}$ is a conjugate of $x$, so it is also a meridian.\n    For a prime knot like the trefoil, it is a known result that any two non-commuting meridional elements generate the entire knot group. Let's check if $x$ and $yxy^{-1}$ commute in $G_{3_1} = B_3$:\n    $[x, yxy^{-1}] = x(yxy^{-1})x^{-1}(yxy^{-1})^{-1} = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}xyx y^{-1}$.\n    Using $xyx=yxy$: $x(yxy)y^{-2}x^{-1}y(yxy)^{-1} \\neq 1$. In fact, as elements of $B_3$, $x=\\sigma_1$ and $y=\\sigma_2$ do not commute, nor do $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2^{-1}$.\n4.  Since $x$ and $yxy^{-1}$ are two meridians that generate $G_{3_1}$, the subgroup $S$ contains all of $G_{3_1}$. In particular, $y \\in S$.\n5.  Since $y \\in S$ and $yt \\in S$, we can write $t = y^{-1}(yt)$, which means $t \\in S$.\n6.  The subgroup $S$ contains $x$, $y$, and $t$. Since these elements generate $\\Gamma$, the subgroup $S$ must be $\\Gamma$ itself.\n7.  We have found a set of two elements, $\\{x, yt\\}$, that generates $\\Gamma$.\n\n### Step 7: Final Conclusion\nWe have shown that $d(\\Gamma) \\ge 2$ and we found a generating set of size 2. Therefore, the minimal number of generators is 2.\n\n>>>2"
