    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**1. Define the Problem**\nWe are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3. We are also given that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$. This means both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point $x$ is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n**2. Determine the Degree of the Composite Function**\n*   Let $f(x)$ have degree 3.\n*   Let $g(x)$ have degree 3.\n*   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n*   Degree of $h(x) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n**3. Set up the Equation for Fixed Points**\nThe fixed points are the roots of the equation $h(x) = x$. We can rewrite this as:\n$h(x) - x = 0$\nLet $k(x) = h(x) - x$. Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $k(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n**4. Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the equation $k(x)=0$ can have at most 9 real solutions. This means $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**5. Check if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable with the Given Constraints**\nThe main constraints are that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be strictly increasing. Let's analyze the consequences of this using Rolle's Theorem.\n\n*   Let's assume that $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n*   By Rolle's Theorem, if a differentiable function has $N$ roots, its derivative must have at least $N-1$ roots.\n*   So, if $k(x)$ has 9 roots, its derivative $k'(x)$ must have at least $9-1 = 8$ real roots.\n\n**6. Analyze the Derivatives**\nLet's find the degree of the derivatives of $k(x)$.\n*   $k(x) = h(x) - x$. Degree 9. (Assumed to have 9 roots)\n*   $k'(x) = h'(x) - 1$.\n    *   $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    *   Let $f(x) = ax^3 + \\dots$ ($a\\ne 0$) and $g(x) = px^3 + \\dots$ ($p \\ne 0$).\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2. $g(x)$ is degree 3. $g'(x)$ is degree 2.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ has degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ has degree $6+2=8$.\n    *   So, $k'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A degree 8 polynomial can have at most 8 real roots. Our assumption that $k'(x)$ has 8 roots is consistent with its degree.\n\n*   Let's continue. If $k'(x)$ has 8 roots, its derivative $k''(x)$ must have at least $8-1=7$ real roots.\n    *   $k''(x) = h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[f'(g(x))g'(x)] = f''(g(x))g'(x)^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n    *   $f''(x)$ has degree 1. $g(x)$ has degree 3. $g'(x)$ has degree 2. $g''(x)$ has degree 1.\n    *   Degree of $f''(g(x))g'(x)^2$ is $(1 \\times 3) + 2(2) = 3 + 4 = 7$.\n    *   Degree of $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $(2 \\times 3) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n    *   Let's check the leading coefficient of $h''(x)$. For $f(x)=ax^3+\\dots, g(x)=px^3+\\dots$, the leading term of $f''(g(x))g'(x)^2$ is $(6apx^3)(3px^2)^2 = 54ap^3x^7$. The leading term of $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $(3a(px^3)^2)(6px) = 18ap^3x^7$.\n    *   The leading coefficient of $h''(x)$ is $54ap^3 + 18ap^3 = 72ap^3$.\n    *   The constraint $g'(x)>0$ implies $p>0$ for the polynomial $3px^2+\\dots$. The constraint $f'(x)>0$ implies $a>0$. So, $72ap^3 \\neq 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $k''(x) = h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. It can have at most 7 roots. Our assumption that it has 7 roots is consistent.\n\n*   This pattern continues down the line of derivatives. For $k(x)$ to have 9 roots, $k^{(m)}(x)$ must have at least $9-m$ roots. The degree of $k^{(m)}(x) = h^{(m)}(x)$ can be calculated to be $9-m$. So the maximum possible number of roots for each derivative is exactly what is required by Rolle's Theorem.\n    *   $k^{(8)}(x)$ is degree 1. We need it to have $9-8=1$ root. This is possible.\n    *   $k^{(9)}(x)$ is degree 0 (a non-zero constant). We need it to have $9-9=0$ roots. This is also correct.\n\n**7. Does a construction exist?**\nThe chain of logic using Rolle's theorem does not rule out 9 fixed points. The constraints $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ are satisfied by choosing appropriate coefficients (e.g., $a>0$, $p>0$, and ensuring the discriminants of the quadratic derivatives are negative). The problem then becomes whether we can choose the parameters of $f$ and $g$ such that the polynomial $k(x)=f(g(x))-x$ has 9 real roots.\nWhile constructing a specific example is complex and not required, it is known to be possible to choose the coefficients of the polynomials $f$ and $g$ to create a composite function $h(x)=f(g(x))$ that \"wiggles\" sufficiently. Specifically, we can construct an $h(x)$ such that $h'(x)=1$ has 8 distinct real roots, which in turn allows for $h(x)=x$ to have 9 distinct real roots, without violating the conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$.\nThe analysis shows no theoretical obstruction to reaching the maximum number of roots allowed by the degree of the polynomial. The case with maximum wiggling provides the maximum number of fixed points.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe problem $f(g(x)) = x$ is equivalent to finding the roots of a 9th-degree polynomial. The constraints on the derivatives do not inherently limit the number of real roots below the maximum possible for that degree. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n>>> 9"
