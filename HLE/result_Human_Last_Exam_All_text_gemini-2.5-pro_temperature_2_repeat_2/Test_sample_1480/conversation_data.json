    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **System Type:** The problem is set in the context of an \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" (IT3FS). This is an advanced fuzzy model with a high degree of complexity, designed to handle significant uncertainty.\n*   **Given Values:**\n    1.  `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This represents the output of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th fuzzy rule for a given input `x'`. In the context of fuzzy logic, this value is interpreted as the **firing strength** or **degree of fulfillment** of the rule's premise.\n    2.  `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This represents the membership degree of a specific value `y_j` in the fuzzy set `G_k_j`, which is the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the k-th rule.\n*   **Operation:** The problem specifies using a **t-norm operation**. A t-norm is a type of function used to model the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic.\n*   **Goal:** The objective is to find the **\"rule activation level\"**.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Problem and List Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Simplification of IT3FS:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** A full calculation involving IT3FS is extremely complex. It involves operations on `α`-planes, resulting in Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2FS), and the final result would not be a single number but another IT3FS.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The problem provides simple scalar values (0.7 and 0.9). This strongly implies that the question is a simplified representation of one specific step in the fuzzy inference process. The \"IT3FS\" context is likely provided to frame the problem within modern fuzzy systems, but the calculation itself has been reduced to its fundamental components. We can assume these scalar values represent a specific point or a simplified aggregation (like a centroid) within the complex IT3FS structure.\n\n2.  **Meaning of \"Rule Activation Level\":**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term \"rule activation level\" can be ambiguous. It could refer to the antecedent firing strength (`Phi_k(x′)`), or it could refer to the result of applying this firing strength to the consequent fuzzy set.\n    *   **Interpretation:** Since the question provides both the antecedent firing strength (`0.7`) and a consequent membership value (`0.9`) and asks to combine them with a t-norm, the \"rule activation level\" must refer to the result of this combination. This step is known as **fuzzy implication**, which determines the output fuzzy set of the rule. We are asked for the membership grade in this output set at point `y_j`.\n\n3.  **Role of the t-norm:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The specific type of t-norm (e.g., Minimum, Product, Łukasiewicz) is not stated. The choice of t-norm will affect the final result.\n    *   **Interpretation:** In the absence of a specified t-norm, we should consider the most common ones used in fuzzy implication.\n        *   **Minimum t-norm:** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`. This corresponds to the **Mamdani implication** method, where the antecedent firing strength \"clips\" the consequent fuzzy set. It is the most common and historically the first method used.\n        *   **Product t-norm:** `T(a, b) = a * b`. This corresponds to the **Larsen implication** method, where the antecedent firing strength \"scales\" the consequent fuzzy set.\n    *   **Decision:** The Mamdani `min` operator is arguably the most fundamental and widely recognized choice, often treated as the default in general fuzzy logic problems. We will proceed using the Minimum t-norm.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the problem simplifies to the following calculation:\n\n**Rule Activation Level = t-norm( Antecedent Firing Strength, Consequent Membership Grade )**\n\n1.  Substitute the given values into the formula:\n    `Rule Activation Level = t-norm( Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j) )`\n    `Rule Activation Level = t-norm( 0.7, 0.9 )`\n\n2.  Apply the chosen t-norm (Minimum) to the values:\n    `Rule Activation Level = min( 0.7, 0.9 )`\n\n3.  Calculate the result:\n    `Rule Activation Level = 0.7`\n\nThe result `0.7` represents the membership grade of `y_j` in the output fuzzy set generated by rule `k` after the implication step.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
