    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure eight knot.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Knot Coloring\nKnot coloring, specifically Fox n-coloring, is a method to distinguish knots from one another. It involves assigning a \"color\" (an integer) to each arc of a knot diagram.\n\n*   **The Structure:** The colors are taken from the set {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}. This set, along with addition and multiplication modulo n, forms the algebraic structure `ℤₙ`. The number of elements in this structure is `n`.\n*   **The Rule:** At every crossing in the knot diagram, the colors must satisfy a specific rule. If an over-arc has color `z`, and the two under-arcs it crosses have colors `x` and `y`, then the rule is: `2z ≡ x + y (mod n)`.\n*   **The Goal:** A knot is considered \"n-colorable\" if we can find a coloring that satisfies this rule for all crossings and uses at least two different colors. We are looking for the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure eight knot is n-colorable. This `n` will be the number of elements in the required algebraic structure.\n\n### Step 2: Set up the Equations for the Figure Eight Knot\nThe figure eight knot (knot 4₁) has a standard diagram with 4 arcs and 4 crossings. Let's label the colors of the four arcs as `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`.\n\nBy examining a standard diagram of the figure eight knot and applying the coloring rule at each of the four crossings, we get a system of linear equations (congruences modulo n):\n\n1.  At crossing 1: `2x₁ ≡ x₂ + x₄ (mod n)`\n2.  At crossing 2: `2x₂ ≡ x₃ + x₄ (mod n)`\n3.  At crossing 3: `2x₃ ≡ x₁ + x₂ (mod n)`\n4.  At crossing 4: `2x₄ ≡ x₁ + x₃ (mod n)`\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form `M * x ≡ 0 (mod n)`, where `x` is the column vector of colors `[x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄]ᵀ` and `M` is the coloring matrix:\n```\nM = |  2  -1   0  -1 |\n    |  0   2  -1  -1 |\n    | -1  -1   2   0 |\n    | -1   0  -1   2 |\n```\n*(Note: The exact matrix depends on labeling, but its determinant properties are invariant).*\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Condition for Colorability\nA knot is n-colorable if and only if this system of equations has a non-trivial solution (one where not all colors are the same). A non-trivial solution exists if and only if the **knot determinant** shares a common factor with `n` greater than 1.\n\nThe knot determinant, let's call it `D`, is calculated from the coloring matrix. For any knot, the columns (and rows) of its coloring matrix sum to zero. This implies `det(M) = 0`. The knot determinant `D` is defined as the absolute value of the determinant of any submatrix obtained by deleting one row and one column from `M`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Knot Determinant\nLet's calculate `D` by deleting the first row and first column from our matrix `M`.\nThe submatrix `M'` is:\n```\nM' = |  2  -1  -1 |\n     | -1   2   0 |\n     |  0  -1   2 |\n```\nNow, we calculate the determinant of `M'`:\n`det(M') = 2 * det(|2 0|, |-1 2|) - (-1) * det(|-1 0|, |0 2|) + (-1) * det(|-1 2|, |0 -1|)`\n`det(M') = 2 * (2*2 - 0*(-1)) + 1 * ((-1)*2 - 0*0) - 1 * ((-1)*(-1) - 2*0)`\n`det(M') = 2 * (4) + 1 * (-2) - 1 * (1)`\n`det(M') = 8 - 2 - 1 = 5`\n\nLet's double-check with a different submatrix, say by removing the last row and last column.\nThe submatrix `M''` is:\n```\nM''= |  2  -1   0 |\n     |  0   2  -1 |\n     | -1  -1   2 |\n```\n`det(M'') = 2 * (2*2 - (-1)*(-1)) - (-1) * (0*2 - (-1)*(-1)) + 0`\n`det(M'') = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (0 - 1)`\n`det(M'') = 2 * (3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5`\n\nThe calculations consistently yield 5. The absolute value is `|5| = 5`.\nSo, the determinant of the figure eight knot is `D = 5`.\n\n### Step 5: Find the Smallest Number of Elements `n`\nA knot is n-colorable if `gcd(n, D) > 1`.\nFor the figure eight knot, `D = 5`. So, we need to find the smallest integer `n > 1` such that `gcd(n, 5) > 1`.\n\nSince 5 is a prime number, its only divisors are 1 and 5. For `gcd(n, 5)` to be greater than 1, `n` must have 5 as a factor. In other words, `n` must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe smallest integer `n > 1` that is a multiple of 5 is `n = 5`.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of colors needed is 5. This corresponds to an algebraic structure with 5 elements (`ℤ₅`).\n\nFinal conclusion: The smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure eight knot has 5 elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
