    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat of the Coiled-Coil\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, called a heptad repeat, which is conventionally labeled `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the oligomer through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. The spacing between these core residues follows a consistent `h-x-x-h-x-x-x` pattern, where `h` is a hydrophobic residue. This means the hydrophobic `a` and `d` residues are separated by 2 residues (`d-a = 3 positions`) and the `d` and the next `a` residue are separated by 3 residues (`a'-d = 4 positions`).\n\nLet's examine the sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe can assign the `abcdefg` positions to find the most chemically sound arrangement. The most plausible alignment, which places hydrophobic residues at the core `a` and `d` positions, starts the first heptad (`a` position) at the first Isoleucine (I) residue.\n\nLet's write out the sequence with this alignment:\n\n*   **Sequence:**   G E **I** A Q **S** L K E **I** A K **K** S L K **E** I A W S L K **E** I A Q S L K G\n    *   Correction, careful re-reading of the sequence and re-aligning.\n*   **Sequence:** `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n*   Let's establish the register. Isoleucine at position 3 seems a good candidate for an 'a' position.\n*   Let `I` at position 3 be `a`.\n    *   `a`: pos 3 (`I`)\n    *   `d`: pos 6 (`S`)\n    *   `a'`: pos 10 (`I`)\n    *   `d'`: pos 13 (`K`)\n    *   `a''`: pos 17 (`I`)\n    *   `d''`: pos 20 (`W`)\n    *   `a'''`: pos 24 (`I`)\n    *   `d'''`: pos 27 (`Q`)\n\nLet's visualize the alignment:\n```\nPosition:      a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g\nSequence:   ...I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K...\n```\n\nThis alignment reveals the residues at the critical `a` and `d` core positions for each of the four heptad repeats:\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I\n*   **`d` positions:** S, K, W, Q\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Core Residues based on Knobs-into-Holes Packing\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by the identity and packing efficiency of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\n**Analysis of the `a` position:**\n*   The sequence contains **Isoleucine (I)** at every `a` position.\n*   Isoleucine is a β-branched amino acid (it has a branch at the first carbon of its side chain).\n*   Due to the steric constraints of its shape, Isoleucine packs most favorably at the `a` position of a **trimeric (3-helix)** coiled-coil.\n*   This `a=I` pattern is considered a canonical, strong determinant for forming trimers. It is unfavorable in dimers, and in tetramers, Isoleucine is strongly preferred at the `d` position, not the `a` position.\n\n**Analysis of the `d` position:**\n*   The `d` position is highly variable in this sequence: Serine (S), Lysine (K), Tryptophan (W), and Glutamine (Q).\n*   This is a very unusual mix:\n    *   **S, K, Q** are polar or charged. Placing these in the hydrophobic core is generally unfavorable. However, such \"polar layers\" can exist and be stabilized by intra-core hydrogen bonds or salt bridges.\n    *   **W** is very large and hydrophobic.\n*   The inconsistency at the `d` position means it does not provide a single, clear signal for a specific oligomeric state. Instead, it seems to modulate the structure defined by the `a` positions.\n\n### Step 3: Conclude the Most Probable Oligomeric State\n\nWe must weigh the evidence from both core positions.\n*   The signal from the `a` position (`I, I, I, I`) is **consistent, unambiguous, and strong**. It points overwhelmingly towards a **trimer**.\n*   The signal from the `d` position (`S, K, W, Q`) is mixed and contains residues that are highly disruptive to a canonical hydrophobic core. While these layers will affect the overall stability, they do not provide a competing signal strong enough to override the powerful trimer-directing propensity of the four Isoleucine layers.\n\nTherefore, the protein will most likely adopt the oligomeric state that satisfies the packing requirements of the most consistent determinant. The most efficient packing for the four layers of `a=I` is in a trimeric coiled-coil.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Correctly identify the heptad repeat register.** A wrong assignment of `a` and `d` positions would lead to an incorrect conclusion. The `h-x-x-h` pattern is the key.\n2.  **Recognize the hierarchy of determinants.** A consistent signal across all repeating units (like `a=I`) is more significant than a variable and conflicting signal at another position.\n3.  **Understand the structural role of specific amino acids.** Knowing that β-branched amino acids like Isoleucine have a strong preference for the `a` position in trimers is fundamental to solving this problem.\n4.  **Do not be completely deterred by non-canonical core residues.** While polar residues in the core are unusual, they can be accommodated. The key is to assess their influence relative to the stronger canonical signals present.\n\nBased on the strong and consistent signal from the Isoleucine residues at the `a` position, the oligomeric state of this coiled-coil is most likely to be 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
