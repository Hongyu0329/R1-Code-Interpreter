    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find a specific number based on three criteria:\n1.  The individual must be a \"historical saint\".\n2.  The individual must be \"mentioned by name\".\n3.  The mention must occur within Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Historical Saint\"**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. A \"historical saint\" refers to a figure from history recognized for exceptional holiness within Christian traditions (Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, etc.). This definition is not limited to individuals canonized by the Catholic Church, nor is it restricted to figures whom Milton himself explicitly labels with the title \"Saint.\" The term includes the great patriarchs, prophets, and righteous kings of the Old Testament, who are venerated as saints across Christendom. Milton's narrative focus in *Paradise Lost*, especially in the historical overview shown to Adam, is on these foundational biblical figures.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Location in the Text**\nWhile *Paradise Lost* spans 12 books, the section where historical figures are most likely to be named is in Books XI and XII. In these concluding books, the Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of future human history, from his immediate descendants through the events of the Old Testament and the life of Christ.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Verify the Candidates**\nWe must systematically read or search through the text, primarily Books XI and XII, for names of individuals who meet the \"historical saint\" criteria.\n\n*   **In Book XI:**\n    1.  **Abel:** He is mentioned by name in the account of his murder by Cain. As Christianity's first martyr (or protomartyr), he is universally considered a saint.\n    2.  **Enoch:** Mentioned by name. He is the only individual in the entire poem to whom Milton's narrator applies the specific title \"Saint\" (\"...the only Saint of all his Age...\").\n    3.  **Noah:** Mentioned by name as the \"one just Man\" saved from the flood. As a righteous patriarch, he is considered a saint.\n\n*   **In Book XII:**\n    4.  **Abraham:** Mentioned frequently by name as the great patriarch and exemplar of faith. He is venerated as a saint.\n    5.  **Isaac:** Mentioned by name as the son of Abraham (\"...and his Son Isaac...\"). He is venerated as a saint.\n    6.  **Jacob:** Mentioned by name along with his father, Isaac. He is venerated as a saint.\n    7.  **Joseph:** Mentioned by name in the telling of his story in Egypt. He is venerated as a saint.\n    8.  **Moses:** Mentioned prominently by name as the prophet and lawgiver. He is considered a major saint in Christian tradition.\n    9.  **Joshua:** Mentioned by name as Moses' successor (\"Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call\"). He is revered as a saint.\n    10. **David:** Mentioned by name as the great king from whose line Christ would descend. He is a prominent saint.\n    11. **Solomon:** Mentioned by name as the son of David who builds the Temple. He is revered as a saint.\n    12. **Josiah:** Mentioned by name as a righteous king who reformed Israel. He is considered a saint in Eastern Orthodox tradition.\n\n**Step 5: Note Significant Omissions**\nIt is crucial to note that Milton deliberately avoids mentioning any New Testament saints by name. Mary is referred to only as \"the Virgin\" or through prophecy (\"thy seed\"). Key apostles like Peter and Paul are not named, nor is John the Baptist. This is a reflection of Milton's Puritan theology, which rejected the \"saints' cults\" and church hierarchies (particularly the Papacy, which bases its authority on Saint Peter).\n\n**Step 6: Final Tally**\nBased on the careful identification and verification process, the list of historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost* is composed entirely of Old Testament figures. The complete list is: Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon, and Josiah.\n\nCounting these individuals yields the final number.\n\n<<<12>>>"
