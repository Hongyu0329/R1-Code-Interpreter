Based on the recorded legal documents:

*   **Tommy's Estate owns Lot B** with Land Tax Map Number `1234567890` and Trailer Number `1234567890.1`.

*   **Tommy's Estate owns Lot A** with Land Tax Map Number `0987654321` and Trailer Number `0987654321.1`.

Due to his failure to correct his deed, James does not have legal title to either lot. His original deed for Lot B was superseded by the corrected deed from Tommy's Estate, and he never filed a deed to claim Lot A.
