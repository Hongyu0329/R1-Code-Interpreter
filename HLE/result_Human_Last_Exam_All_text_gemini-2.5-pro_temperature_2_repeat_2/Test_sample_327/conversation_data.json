    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces required to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Representation of Numbers in Red-Blue Hackenbush**\n\nIn red-blue Hackenbush, numerical values are often associated with game positions. Dyadic rational numbers (fractions of the form $\\frac{p}{2^q}$) have a standard representation as a single \"stalk\" of red and blue pieces (edges) connected to the ground.\n\nThe value of a stalk is determined by the colors of its pieces, read from the top of the stalk down to the ground.\n\n**2. The Formula for a Hackenbush Stalk's Value**\n\nLet a stalk consist of $n$ pieces. Let the color of the pieces from top to bottom be $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$. The value, $V$, of this stalk is given by the formula:\n\n$V = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\delta_i}{2^i} = \\frac{\\delta_1}{2} + \\frac{\\delta_2}{4} + \\frac{\\delta_3}{8} + \\ldots + \\frac{\\delta_n}{2^n}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\delta_i = +1$ if the $i$-th piece from the top ($c_i$) is red.\n*   $\\delta_i = -1$ if the $i$-th piece from the top ($c_i$) is blue.\n\n**3. Setting up the Equation for $\\frac{13}{16}$**\n\nWe want to find the number of pieces, $n$, needed to represent the value $V = \\frac{13}{16}$. We set up the equation:\n\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\delta_i}{2^i}$\n\n**4. Determining the Number of Pieces (n)**\n\nTo find the required number of pieces, $n$, we can analyze the properties of the equation. Let's multiply both sides by $2^n$:\n\n$\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^n = 2^n \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\delta_i}{2^i}\\right)$\n\n$\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^n = \\delta_1 2^{n-1} + \\delta_2 2^{n-2} + \\ldots + \\delta_{n-1} 2^1 + \\delta_n 2^0$\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The right-hand side must be an integer.**\n    The sum on the right-hand side is a sum of integers, so the result is an integer. This means the left-hand side, $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^n$, must also be an integer. For this to be true, $2^n$ must be divisible by 16 ($=2^4$), which implies that $n$ must be at least 4 ($n \\ge 4$).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The right-hand side must be an odd integer.**\n    In the sum $\\delta_1 2^{n-1} + \\delta_2 2^{n-2} + \\ldots + \\delta_{n-1} 2^1 + \\delta_n$, every term except the last one ($\\delta_n$) is a multiple of 2 (i.e., even). The last term, $\\delta_n$, is either +1 or -1, which is always an odd number. The sum of any number of even integers and one odd integer is always odd. Therefore, the right-hand side of the equation is an odd integer.\n\n*   **Finding n:**\n    We must find the smallest integer $n \\ge 4$ such that $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^n$ is an odd integer.\n    Let's test the values of $n$:\n    *   If $n = 4$: $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^4 = \\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 16 = 13$. The number 13 is odd. This works.\n    *   If $n = 5$: $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^5 = \\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 32 = 13 \\cdot 2 = 26$. The number 26 is even. This doesn't work.\n    *   If $n > 4$: $\\frac{13}{16} \\cdot 2^n = 13 \\cdot 2^{n-4}$. Since $n-4 \\ge 1$, this will always be an even number. This doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the only possible number of pieces in a single-stalk representation is $n=4$. This corresponds to the canonical (simplest) representation.\n\n**5. Finding the Color Sequence (Optional Verification)**\n\nWith $n=4$, we must solve for the $\\delta_i$ values:\n$13 = \\delta_1 2^{4-1} + \\delta_2 2^{4-2} + \\delta_3 2^{4-3} + \\delta_4 2^{4-4}$\n$13 = 8\\delta_1 + 4\\delta_2 + 2\\delta_3 + \\delta_4$\n\nWe can find the values of $\\delta_i$ systematically:\n*   The maximum possible value is $8+4+2+1 = 15$. To get 13, the first term $8\\delta_1$ must be positive, so $\\delta_1=+1$.\n    $13 - 8 = 5$. We now need $5 = 4\\delta_2 + 2\\delta_3 + \\delta_4$.\n*   To get 5, the term $4\\delta_2$ must be positive, so $\\delta_2=+1$.\n    $5 - 4 = 1$. We now need $1 = 2\\delta_3 + \\delta_4$.\n*   To get 1, the term $2\\delta_3$ must be positive, so $\\delta_3=+1$.\n    $1 - 2 = -1$. We now need $-1 = \\delta_4$.\n*   So, $\\delta_4=-1$.\n\nThe sequence of coefficients is $(+1, +1, +1, -1)$. This corresponds to a stalk with colors from top to bottom: Red, Red, Red, Blue. The total number of pieces is 4.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe minimal number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue Hackenbush is determined by finding the length of its canonical stalk representation. Based on the analysis, this number is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
