    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct theologian.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** We are looking for a specific Christian theologian.\n    *   **What:** This theologian must have *developed specialized terminology*.\n    *   **Why:** The terminology is used to describe *changes in the laws of nature*.\n    *   **Application 1:** The terminology must be applicable to explaining the **virgin birth of Jesus**.\n    *   **Application 2:** The terminology must also be applicable to explaining **possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall** of Adam and Eve.\n\n2.  **Initial Theological Considerations:**\n    *   The question touches on core topics in systematic theology: creation (the nature of natural law), hamartiology (the doctrine of sin and the Fall), and Christology (the doctrine of Christ, including the virgin birth).\n    *   The need for \"specialized terminology\" to explain how God acts in relation to nature points away from theologians who simply state that \"God can do anything\" and toward someone who tried to create a philosophical and theological framework to understand *how* God's action relates to the created order.\n    *   The requirement that this theologian be the *first* points us toward the early church (the Patristic period) or the early Middle Ages, where these foundational doctrines were being systematically articulated.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Potential Candidates:**\n    *   **Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130 – c. 202 AD):** Wrote extensively against Gnosticism and discussed creation, the Fall, and the person of Christ, but he did not develop a specific terminological system for the *mechanics* of natural law alterations.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274 AD):** A very strong candidate who developed a sophisticated system. He used the distinction between Primary Causality (God's direct action) and Secondary Causality (the operation of natural laws). He would explain a miracle like the virgin birth as God, the Primary Cause, acting directly and bypassing the normal secondary causes of procreation. However, the specific concept of *pre-loaded potentials* in nature that are activated later is more characteristic of an earlier thinker he drew upon.\n    *   **John Calvin (1509 – 1564 AD):** Focused heavily on God's absolute sovereignty and providence. While he believed God upholds and can intervene in the natural order, his primary focus wasn't on developing a philosophical vocabulary for *how* natural laws might be altered or contain hidden potentials.\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430 AD):** This is the most promising candidate. Augustine wrote extensively on creation, particularly in his work *De Genesi ad Litteram* (The Literal Meaning of Genesis). To reconcile the idea that God created everything in six days with the fact that new things continually appear in the world, he developed a unique concept.\n\n4.  **Focusing on Augustine of Hippo's Terminology:**\n    *   **The Specialized Terminology:** Augustine, influenced by Stoic and Neoplatonic ideas, developed the concept of ***rationes seminales*** (Latin for \"seminal reasons\" or \"seed-like principles\"), which can also be referred to as ***rationes causales*** (\"causal reasons\").\n    *   **The Core Idea:** He proposed that God, in the initial act of creation, did not create everything in its final, mature form. Instead, God embedded these \"seminal reasons\" within the created order. These are latent potentialities or blueprints for everything that would later develop or come into being naturally over time. Think of them as the pre-programmed \"software\" of the universe.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** How does this explain changes at the Fall? Augustine could argue that God embedded certain causal principles that were intended to remain latent but were \"activated\" by human sin. For example, the potential for plants to grow thorns, for animals to be hostile, or for the human body to be subject to disease and death were part of the *rationes seminales* from the beginning, only to be triggered by the Fall. This provides a mechanism for a change in nature's behavior without God having to \"re-create\" it or change the fundamental laws.\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** How does this explain the virgin birth? This is a classic example Augustine used. The normal course of nature (a secondary cause) requires a male and a female for procreation. However, Augustine argued that the *ratio causalis* for a human being was already present in the matter of Mary's womb. A miracle like the virgin birth occurs when God bypasses the usual chain of secondary causes and directly activates a seminal reason himself. God provided the active, formative principle to unite with the passive, material principle in Mary, bringing forth a new human life without the ordinary means. This allows the miracle to be an act of God *within* the potencies of his own creation, rather than a violation of it from the outside.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAugustine of Hippo is the first major Christian theologian to develop a specific, specialized philosophical vocabulary—the doctrine of *rationes seminales* or *causales*—to systematically explain how alterations in the ordinary course of nature can occur. He applied this single framework to account for both unique miraculous events like the virgin birth and systemic shifts in the natural world's operation, such as those that might have occurred after the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
