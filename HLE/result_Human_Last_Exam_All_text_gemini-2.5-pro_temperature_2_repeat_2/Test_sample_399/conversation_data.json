    "This problem is an initial value problem for a first-order ordinary differential equation. We will solve it using the method of separation of variables.\n\n**1. Analyze the Differential Equation**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a separable equation because we can group all terms involving $x$ and $dx$ on one side of the equation, and all terms involving $t$ and $dt$ on the other side.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The equation is non-linear due to the $x^2$ term.\n*   We should check for constant (equilibrium) solutions. If $x(t) = 0$ for all $t$, then $x'(t) = 0$. The equation becomes $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is true. So, $x(t)=0$ is a solution.\n*   However, the initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, our solution is not the trivial one, and we can safely divide by $x^2$ without worrying about division by zero for the solution curve we are interested in.\n\n**2. Separation of Variables**\n\nDivide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply by $dt$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**3. Integration**\n\nIntegrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\n\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   Left side: $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n*   Right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nCombining the results and adding the constant of integration, C:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Remember that the integral of $x^{-2}$ is $-x^{-1}$, not $\\ln|x^2|$ or any other function. This is a common mistake.\n*   Include the constant of integration, $C$, on one side of the equation.\n\n**4. Apply the Initial Condition**\n\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0)=-8$. We use this to find the value of the constant $C$. Substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our integrated equation:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\nNow we have the value for $C$.\n\n**5. Find the Particular Solution**\n\nSubstitute $C = \\frac{1}{8}$ back into the equation:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo find an explicit expression for $x(t)$, we first solve for $\\frac{1}{x}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = - \\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides to find $x(t)$:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n\n**6. Find the Value of x(1)**\n\nThe final step is to evaluate the solution $x(t)$ at $t=1$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1^2}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n\nTo simplify the denominator, find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{8}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{-4 + 8 - 1}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n**Careful Point:**\n*   Be careful with the arithmetic, especially with fractions and signs, during the final calculation.\n\nThe final answer is $8/3$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
