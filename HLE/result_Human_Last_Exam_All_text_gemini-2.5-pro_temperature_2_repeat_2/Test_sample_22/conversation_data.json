    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical, population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of the variation in a phenotype (e.g., height, risk for a disease) that can be attributed to the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It is the *theoretical maximum* amount of variance that could ever be explained by a perfect linear model using all common SNPs, assuming we knew their true effects.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool, not a theoretical parameter. A PGS is a score calculated for an individual that summarizes their estimated genetic predisposition for a trait. It is built by taking a weighted sum of the individual's genotypes at many different SNPs. The weights (the estimated importance of each SNP) are derived from the results of a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is a measure of how well the PGS actually works in practice. It is typically quantified by calculating the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain in a new, independent set of individuals (not used in the original GWAS). This is often measured by R-squared (R²) from a regression of the phenotype on the PGS.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Relationship Between the Concepts**\n\nThe core of the question is to compare the *actual performance* of a predictive tool (the PGS) with the *theoretical maximum possible performance* (the SNP heritability).\n\n*   SNP heritability (h²_SNP) sets the ceiling. It tells us the total amount of phenotypic variance that is potentially predictable using a linear model of common SNPs.\n*   The PGS is our attempt to build that model. The variance explained by the PGS (R²_PGS) is the performance we achieve with our constructed model.\n\n**Step 3: List Careful Points and Reasons for the Discrepancy**\n\nThe predictive ability of a PGS (R²_PGS) is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) because the construction of a PGS suffers from several real-world limitations that are not part of the theoretical definition of h²_SNP.\n\n1.  **Imperfect Effect Size Estimates:** The weights used in a PGS are *estimates* from a GWAS. Because GWAS are conducted on finite samples of people, these estimates always have some degree of statistical error. They are not the *true* biological effect sizes. SNP heritability, in its definition, assumes the true effect sizes.\n2.  **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The accuracy of the estimated effect sizes is directly related to the size of the GWAS sample. While larger samples lead to better estimates and more powerful PGS, no real-world sample is infinitely large. Theoretical models show that the R² of a PGS only approaches the h²_SNP as the GWAS sample size approaches infinity.\n3.  **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** GWAS often identifies SNPs that are not the causal variants themselves, but are simply located nearby on the chromosome and inherited together (a phenomenon called LD). The strength of this correlation (LD) may not be perfect, and LD patterns can differ between the population used for the GWAS and the population in which the PGS is being tested. This mismatch reduces predictive accuracy.\n4.  **Model Assumptions:** Standard PGS models assume all SNP effects are additive. They generally do not account for more complex genetic interactions (epistasis) or interactions between genes and the environment. SNP heritability is also based on an additive model, but the practical PGS model used may be a further simplification.\n5.  **Exclusion of Causal Variants:** PGS models might not include every single SNP that contributes to the trait. Some methods apply a p-value threshold, only including SNPs that show a sufficiently strong statistical signal in the GWAS, thereby missing those with smaller but real effects.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBecause the PGS is a practical and imperfect estimator trying to capture a theoretical quantity, its performance will be degraded by the factors listed above (estimation error, LD, finite sample sizes, etc.). The SNP heritability represents the \"best-case scenario\" or the upper bound on predictive power. Therefore, the variance explained by any achievable PGS will be lower than the SNP heritability. In an idealized, impossible world with infinite data and perfect knowledge, the two could be equal. But in reality, the predictive ability of a PGS is *necessarily* constrained to be lower than the SNP heritability.\n\nThus, the statement is true.\n\n<<<True>>>"
