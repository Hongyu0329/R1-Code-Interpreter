The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing catalytic performance is reaction-dependent.

*   **For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction,** the optimal nominal atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni+Ce) is in the range of **0.1 to 0.2**. This maximizes the crucial Ni-Ceria interface area, which enhances activity and selectivity towards Hâ‚‚, while preventing Ni particle agglomeration.

*   **For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS) cycles,** the ideal ratio is significantly lower. An atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni+Ce) of approximately **0.05** (5 mol% Ni doping) is optimal. At this concentration, Ni acts as a dopant within the Ceria lattice, effectively enhancing its redox properties and hydrogen production without causing detrimental phase segregation.
