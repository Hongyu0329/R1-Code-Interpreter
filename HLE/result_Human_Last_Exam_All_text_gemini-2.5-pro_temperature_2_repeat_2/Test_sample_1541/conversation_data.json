    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient solution and calculate the total memory used by its variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Input:** The program receives a single line of input, which is a string representing a mathematical sum. For example, \"3+2+1\".\n2.  **Content of Input:** The string consists only of digits ('1', '2', '3', '4') and the '+' character. It is guaranteed to be a valid sum structure. The maximum length of the string is 1000 characters.\n3.  **Task:** The goal is to reorder the numbers in the sum so that they appear in non-decreasing (sorted) order.\n4.  **Output:** The program should print the rearranged sum. For \"3+2+1\", the output must be \"1+2+3\". For \"4+2+4+1\", the output must be \"1+2+4+4\".\n5.  **Primary Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\".\n6.  **Final Task:** Calculate and provide the total memory in bytes, `m`, used for the variables in this memory-efficient program.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Algorithm Choice:** A naive approach would be to parse the string, store the numbers in an integer array, sort the array, and then print the result. This would require an array to hold up to `(1000+1)/2 = 500.5`, so 500 integers, which is memory-inefficient (`500 * 4 = 2000` bytes).\n*   **Leveraging Constraints:** The crucial observation is that the numbers are limited to only 1, 2, 3, and 4. This strongly suggests a counting-based approach (like Counting Sort), which is far more efficient in terms of both time and memory for such data.\n*   **Input Processing:** To minimize memory, we should avoid storing the entire input string if possible. Reading the input character by character using a function like `getchar()` is the most memory-efficient way.\n*   **Data Type Selection:** A key part of writing a memory-efficient program is choosing the smallest possible data type for each variable that can still correctly store the entire range of required values. For instance, using a `char` instead of an `int` for a counter that only goes up to 10 can save memory.\n*   **Output Generation:** The output needs to be constructed carefully with '+' signs between numbers but not at the very beginning or end. A simple boolean flag can manage this logic.\n*   **Memory Calculation:** The final answer `m` is the sum of the memory allocated for all variables declared in the C program, typically on the stack. We assume standard data type sizes (e.g., `sizeof(int)=4`, `sizeof(short)=2`, `sizeof(char)=1`).\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\n**1. Algorithm Design**\n\nThe most memory-efficient algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize four counters to zero, one for each number (1, 2, 3, 4).\n2.  Read the input string one character at a time in a loop, without storing the whole string.\n3.  Inside the loop, if the character is a digit '1', '2', '3', or '4', increment the corresponding counter. Ignore '+' characters.\n4.  After the input loop finishes, we will have the frequency of each number.\n5.  Print the final sorted sum by iterating from 1 to 4. For each number, print it as many times as its counter indicates, separating each printed number with a '+'. Use a flag to avoid printing a '+' before the very first number.\n\n**2. Variable and Memory Analysis**\n\nWe now select the most memory-efficient C data types for the variables needed to implement this algorithm.\n\n*   **Counters for numbers 1, 2, 3, 4:**\n    *   The maximum length of the input string is 1000. A sum like \"1+1+...+1\" would have the maximum number of terms. For a string of length `L`, the number of terms is `(L+1)/2`. For `L=999` (max odd length), there are `(999+1)/2 = 500` terms.\n    *   Therefore, each counter must be able to hold a value up to 500.\n    *   `unsigned char` has a range of 0-255, which is too small.\n    *   `unsigned short` has a range of 0-65,535, which is sufficient. Its size is 2 bytes.\n    *   We use an array for the four counters: `unsigned short counts[4];`\n    *   Memory used: `4 * sizeof(unsigned short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n\n*   **Variable for Character Input:**\n    *   The standard `getchar()` function returns an `int` type. This is necessary to correctly handle the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value, which lies outside the `char` range.\n    *   Variable: `int c;`\n    *   Memory used: `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n*   **Flag for Output Formatting:**\n    *   We need a simple flag (true/false) to check if we are printing the first term. The smallest addressable data type, `char`, is sufficient for this.\n    *   Variable: `char first_term;`\n    *   Memory used: `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n*   **Loop Control Variables:**\n    *   **Outer loop:** This loop runs 4 times to iterate through the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. A `char` is sufficient to count from 0 to 3. Variable: `char i;`. Memory used: `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n    *   **Inner loop:** This loop prints each number repeatedly. It needs to count up to the value stored in the counters (max ~500). An `unsigned short` is sufficient. Variable: `unsigned short j;`. Memory used: `sizeof(unsigned short) = 2` bytes.\n\n**3. Total Memory Calculation**\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\n\n*   `m` = (memory for `counts` array) + (memory for `c`) + (memory for `first_term` flag) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `j`)\n*   `m = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2`\n*   `m = 16` bytes.\n\nThis represents the total memory allocated on the stack for variables in the most memory-efficient C program for this task.\n\n<<<16>>>"
