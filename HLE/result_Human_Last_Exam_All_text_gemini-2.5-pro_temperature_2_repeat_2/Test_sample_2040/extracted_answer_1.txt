No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The most common and stable phases of boron nanosheets have a centrosymmetric crystal structure. This symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC because the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is inherently zero in such materials.
