    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\nSPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In this phenomenon, a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon), upon interacting with a suitable nonlinear medium, is annihilated. In its place, two new photons of lower energy (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons) are spontaneously generated. This process must conserve both energy and momentum:\n*   **Energy Conservation:** ω_pump = ω_signal + ω_idler (where ω is the angular frequency)\n*   **Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching):** **k**_pump = **k**_signal + **k**_idler (where **k** is the wavevector)\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Key Material Property for SPDC**\n\nSPDC is classified as a **second-order nonlinear optical process**. The strength of such processes in a material is governed by its **second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility**, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾**. If a material has a χ⁽²⁾ value of zero, it cannot support second-order processes like SPDC or its more classical counterpart, second-harmonic generation (SHG).\n\n**Step 3: Linking Material Symmetry to the χ⁽²⁾ Susceptibility**\n\nThere is a fundamental selection rule based on crystal symmetry that determines whether χ⁽²⁾ can be non-zero.\n*   In materials that possess **inversion symmetry** (i.e., they are **centrosymmetric**), the bulk χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility is identically zero. Inversion symmetry means the crystal structure looks the same when inverted through a central point (x,y,z) -> (-x,-y,-z). For such materials, applying an electric field **E** and its inverse -**E** must result in an exactly opposite polarization **P**. A second-order effect, proportional to **E²**, does not change sign when the field is inverted ( (-**E**)² = **E**² ), violating this requirement. Thus, second-order effects are forbidden.\n*   Therefore, a material must be **non-centrosymmetric** to exhibit a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ and thus to be a candidate for SPDC.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\nThe next step is to examine the crystal structure of boron nanosheets. Unlike graphene's single stable structure, borophene is **polymorphic**, meaning it can exist in several different stable atomic arrangements. The most widely studied and synthesized phases include:\n*   **β₁₂ borophene:** This structure has a triangular lattice with a specific pattern of hexagonal vacancies. Its space group is *Pmmn*, which is centrosymmetric.\n*   **χ₃ borophene:** This is another stable phase with a different vacancy arrangement. Its space group is *Cmmm*, which is also centrosymmetric.\n*   **Striped phase borophene:** This phase also has the space group *Pmmn* and is therefore centrosymmetric.\n\nSince the common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry, they are classified as centrosymmetric.\n\n**Step 5: Drawing the Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  SPDC requires a material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  A non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ is only possible in materials that lack inversion symmetry (are non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  The common, stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Consequently, the intrinsic bulk χ⁽²⁾ of these boron nanosheets is zero.\n\nTherefore, SPDC is a symmetrically forbidden process in ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ideal vs. Real-World Materials:** This analysis applies to the ideal, defect-free crystal structure. The presence of defects, edges, strain, or interactions with a substrate could locally break the inversion symmetry. However, these effects would not typically lead to an efficient, coherent SPDC process and are not characteristic of the intrinsic material property.\n*   **External Fields:** The application of a strong DC electric field can artificially break the inversion symmetry and induce a second-order response. This is a special condition and not an inherent property of the material itself. The question implies intrinsic behavior under illumination.\n*   **Comparison to Other 2D Materials:** This behavior contrasts sharply with other 2D materials like monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) or hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). These materials are inherently non-centrosymmetric in their monolayer form and thus possess a strong χ⁽²⁾, making them promising candidates for SPDC. Graphene, like borophene, is centrosymmetric and does not exhibit second-order nonlinearity.\n\nBased on the analysis of the intrinsic properties of the material's most common structures, the conclusion is clear.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The most common and stable phases of boron nanosheets have a centrosymmetric crystal structure. This symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC because the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is inherently zero in such materials.>>>"
