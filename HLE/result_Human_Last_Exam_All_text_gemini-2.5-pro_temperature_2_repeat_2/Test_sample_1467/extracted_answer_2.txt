The complexity class for constant precision transformers is **TC0**. The reasoning is that while individual arithmetic operations on constant-bit numbers are simpler, the transformer's architecture fundamentally relies on operations like matrix multiplication and softmax, which involve summing up a polynomial number of terms. Summing or applying a threshold to polynomially many inputs requires the power of TC0 circuits and cannot be done in smaller classes like AC0.

If polynomial steps of chain-of-thought reasoning are allowed, this corresponds to iterating a TC0 circuit for a polynomial number of steps. Such a process creates a computational model equivalent to a polynomial-depth, polynomial-size circuit family. This is a known characterization of the complexity class **P**. The model is in P because the circuit can be evaluated in polynomial time, and it is P-hard because it can simulate any polynomial-time Turing Machine by repeatedly applying the TM's state-transition function (which is in TC0). Therefore, this model's complexity class is **P**.
