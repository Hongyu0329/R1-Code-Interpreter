    "This is an excellent and nuanced poker theory question. Let's break it down step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Scenario's Key Components\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game.\n    *   **100BB depth** is standard. It means post-flop play, implied odds, and stack-to-pot ratios are all significant factors.\n    *   **Rake-free** is a critical detail. Rake is a cost imposed on winning a pot. In a normal game with rake, very marginal hands become unprofitable because the small profit they might make is eaten by the rake. In a rake-free environment, the threshold for profitability is lower, meaning you can profitably play a wider range of hands.\n    *   **Cash game** means we are focused purely on chip EV (Expected Value) with no tournament considerations like ICM.\n\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN).\n    *   The Button is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last post-flop against the Small Blind and Big Blind.\n    *   This positional advantage allows you to \"realize\" your hand's equity much more effectively. You have more information, can control the pot size, and can bluff more successfully.\n    *   For this reason, the Button has the widest pre-flop opening range of any position (excluding the small blind's action when it's folded to them).\n\n*   **Action:** Open to 2.5x.\n    *   This is a standard opening size. It forces the blinds to defend with a reasonably strong range, but still allows us to profit from their folds and post-flop mistakes. The specific size doesn't change the *bottom* of our range as much as the other factors do.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Hand Category and the Question\n\n*   **Hand Category:** Suited Jacks (Jxs). This includes, in descending order of strength: AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n*   **The Question:** \"What is the *worst* suited jack you *should open*?\" This asks for the hand at the absolute bottom of the Jxs range that is still a standard, profitable open-raise in this specific scenario. In Game Theory Optimal (GTO) play, the worst hands in a range are those with the lowest EV that are still opened 100% of the time.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Hands in the Category\n\n1.  **Premium/Strong Jxs (AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs, J9s):** These are exceptionally strong hands. They make top pairs with good kickers, and have excellent straight and flush potential. These are high-profit opens from any position, let alone the button.\n2.  **Middle Jxs (J8s, J7s, J6s):** These hands are still very playable. They are suited connectors or one-gappers, which give them good semi-bluffing potential with flush and straight draws. From the button, these are easy, standard opens.\n3.  **Weak Jxs (J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s):** This is where the decision becomes more interesting.\n    *   **Playability:** As the kicker gets lower, the hand's value decreases. A hand like J2s has poor connectivity (it's hard to make a straight) and is easily dominated if you hit a pair of Jacks (any other Jack beats you). Its primary value comes from making a flush or serving as a bluff/semi-bluff.\n    *   **The Rake-Free Impact:** In a standard *raked* game, the very bottom of this range (J3s, J2s) would often be \"mixed strategies\" in a GTO chart â€“ meaning you open them sometimes and fold them sometimes because their EV is very close to zero. However, the absence of rake adds a small but crucial amount of EV to every hand you play. This is often enough to turn a break-even mixed strategy hand into a pure, 100% open-raise.\n    *   **The Button Position Impact:** The positional advantage from the button is immense. It allows you to win the pot pre-flop when the blinds fold, or out-play them post-flop even with a weak holding. This power pushes the GTO opening range on the button to be extremely wide (often 45-55% of all hands).\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude\n\n*   A GTO opening range from the button in a 100BB game is already very wide.\n*   Removing the rake makes this profitable opening range even wider.\n*   The combination of the most powerful position (Button) and the most favorable condition (rake-free) means that we should be opening an extremely wide selection of hands.\n*   Every single suited Jack (Jxs) is considered a profitable open-raise under these conditions.\n*   The question asks for the \"worst\" of these hands. The objective weakness of suited Jacks descends as the kicker gets lower. Therefore, the worst suited Jack is J2-suited.\n*   Since all suited Jacks are profitable opens in this scenario, the worst one that you *should* open is the weakest one on the list.\n\nThe final answer is **J2s**. It has the lowest equity and worst playability of all suited jacks, but due to the potent combination of being on the button and in a rake-free game, it is still a standard, profitable open-raise.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
