    "The question asks for the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions.\n\nLet's analyze the properties of permutations that have a small number of inversions and the property of avoiding the 1324 pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the 1324 pattern**\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no four indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\pi(i) < \\pi(k) < \\pi(j) < \\pi(l)\\).\nLet the values be \\(a=\\pi(i), b=\\pi(k), c=\\pi(j), d=\\pi(l)\\). The condition is \\(a < b < c < d\\). The permutation subsequence is \\(a, c, b, d\\). This means that to form a 1324 pattern, we must have at least one inversion, which is the pair \\((c, b)\\), where \\(c\\) appears before \\(b\\) but \\(c > b\\).\n\n**Step 2: Classify permutations with 3 inversions**\nThe number of inversions of a permutation is the number of pairs of elements that are out of their natural order. A permutation with a very low number of inversions is structurally close to the identity permutation \\(1, 2, ..., n\\). We can classify permutations with 3 inversions by how the inversions are formed.\nLet's consider permutations of \\(\\{1, ..., n\\}\\) obtained by rearranging a small number of elements, keeping the others in increasing order.\n\nA permutation with 3 inversions can be formed in a few ways. We list the structural types that are \"minimal\" or \"local\".\n1.  **Type I:** Reversing a block of 3 consecutive values.\n    Consider the permutation \\(\\pi\\) formed by taking three consecutive integers \\(\\{i, i+1, i+2\\}\\) and arranging them in decreasing order, while other elements are fixed.\n    \\(\\pi = 1, ..., i-1, \\mathbf{i+2, i+1, i}, i+3, ..., n\\).\n    The inversions are \\((i+2, i+1)\\), \\((i+2, i)\\), and \\((i+1, i)\\). There are exactly 3 inversions.\n    The number of such permutations is \\(n-2\\) (by choosing \\(i\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(n-2\\)). For \\(n=333\\), there are \\(331\\) such permutations.\n\n2.  **Type II:** A cycle on 4 consecutive values.\n    Consider the permutation \\(\\pi\\) formed by taking four consecutive integers \\(\\{x, x+1, x+2, x+3\\}\\) and arranging them in the order \\(x+3, x, x+1, x+2\\), while other elements are fixed.\n    \\(\\pi = 1, ..., x-1, \\mathbf{x+3, x, x+1, x+2}, x+4, ..., n\\).\n    The inversions are \\((x+3, x)\\), \\((x+3, x+1)\\), and \\((x+3, x+2)\\). There are exactly 3 inversions.\n    The number of such permutations is \\(n-3\\) (by choosing \\(x\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(n-3\\)). For \\(n=333\\), there are \\(330\\) such permutations.\n\n3.  **Other types:** There are other ways to form 3 inversions, for example, by creating three disjoint inversions (like in \\(214365...\\)), or by having inversions that are \"scattered\" across the permutation. These permutations are less \"local\" than Types I and II.\n\n**Step 3: Test these permutation types for the 1324 pattern**\nFor a permutation with \\(n=333\\), which is a large number, the existence of a 1324 pattern often depends on whether the inversion \\((c,b)\\) is \"sandwiched\". That is, if there is an element \\(a\\) appearing before \\(c\\) with \\(a<b\\) and an element \\(d\\) appearing after \\(b\\) with \\(d>c\\).\n\nLet's analyze Type I: \\(\\pi = 1, ..., i-1, \\mathbf{i+2, i+1, i}, i+3, ..., n\\).\nTo check for a 1324 pattern, we need an inversion pair \\((c, b)\\). Let's take \\((c,b) = (i+2, i+1)\\). In \\(\\pi\\), these values are at positions \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\).\nWe need to find \\(a = \\pi_{p} < b=i+1\\) with \\(p<i\\), and \\(d = \\pi_{q} > c=i+2\\) with \\(q>i+1\\).\n- If \\(i > 1\\), we can choose \\(p=i-1\\), which gives \\(a=\\pi_{i-1} = i-1\\). We have \\(i-1 < i+1\\), so a valid 'a' exists.\n- If \\(i+3 \\le n\\), we can choose \\(q=i+3\\), which gives \\(d=\\pi_{i+3}=i+3\\). We have \\(i+3 > i+2\\), so a valid 'd' exists.\nWhen both conditions hold (\\(2 \\le i \\le n-3\\)), we find the subsequence \\(\\pi_{i-1}, \\pi_i, \\pi_{i+1}, \\pi_{i+3}\\), which is \\(i-1, i+2, i+1, i+3\\). This forms a 1324 pattern since \\(i-1 < i+1 < i+2 < i+3\\).\nThis type of permutation avoids 1324 only if these conditions fail.\n- If \\(i=1\\): No element appears before position 1, so no 'a' can be found. The permutation is \\(\\pi=3,2,1,4,5,...,n\\). It avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\n- If \\(i=n-2\\): The block is at the end. \\(\\pi=1,...,n-3, n, n-1, n-2\\). No element appears after position n, and no element is greater than n, so no 'd' can be found. It avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\n- If \\(i=n-3\\) and we pick another inversion like \\((i+1,i)\\) \\((n-2, n-3)\\) with \\(\\pi_{n-2}, \\pi_{n-1}\\) the pattern can be found. But with \\(c=n, d\\) cannot be found. If \\(i=2, \\dots, n-3\\) a 1324 pattern exists. So only \\(i=1\\) and \\(i=n-2\\) avoid the pattern.\nSo, there are 2 permutations of Type I that avoid 1324.\n\nLet's analyze Type II: \\(\\pi = 1, ..., x-1, \\mathbf{x+3, x, x+1, x+2}, x+4, ..., n\\).\nLet's take the inversion \\((c,b) = (x+3, x)\\). In \\(\\pi\\), these are at positions \\(x\\) and \\(x+1\\).\n- We need \\(a=\\pi_p < b=x\\) with \\(p<x\\). If \\(x > 1\\), we can pick \\(p=x-1\\), so \\(a=\\pi_{x-1} = x-1\\). This is a valid 'a'.\n- We need \\(d=\\pi_q > c=x+3\\) with \\(q>x+1\\). If \\(x+4 \\le n\\), we can pick \\(q=x+4\\), giving \\(d=\\pi_{x+4}=x+4\\). This is a valid 'd'.\nWhen \\(2 \\le x \\le n-4\\), we find the subsequence \\(\\pi_{x-1}, \\pi_x, \\pi_{x+1}, \\pi_{x+4}\\) which is \\(x-1, x+3, x, x+4\\). This forms a 1324 pattern as \\(x-1 < x < x+3 < x+4\\).\nThis type of permutation avoids 1324 only when these flanking elements cannot be found.\n- If \\(x=1\\): No 'a' can be found. The permutation is \\(\\pi=4,1,2,3,5,...,n\\). It avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\n- If \\(x=n-3\\): The block is at the end. \\(\\pi=1,...,n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1\\). No element is greater than \\(n\\), so 'd' cannot be found. It avoids 1324. (1 permutation)\nSo there are 2 permutations of Type II that avoid 1324.\n\nFor other types of permutations with 3 inversions, the inversions are more separated. For large \\(n\\), this separation provides even more \"room\" to find the flanking elements 'a' and 'd', so they will almost certainly contain the 1324 pattern. For example, the permutation \\(\\pi=214365...n\\) has inversions \\((2,1), (4,3), (6,5)\\). We can form a 1324 pattern using \\(\\pi_2, \\pi_3, \\pi_4, \\pi_5\\), which is \\(1, 4, 3, 6\\).\nThe general principle is that for a large \\(n\\), a permutation with a fixed small number of inversions avoids a pattern like 1324 only if all its inversions are \"clustered\" at one of the ends of the permutation. The analysis above covers these cases.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nFor \\(n=333\\), the permutations with 3 inversions that avoid the 1324 pattern are:\n1.  \\(\\pi = (3, 2, 1, 4, ..., 333)\\)\n2.  \\(\\pi = (1, 2, ..., 330, 333, 332, 331)\\)\n3.  \\(\\pi = (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., 333)\\)\n4.  \\(\\pi = (1, 2, ..., 329, 333, 330, 331, 332)\\)\n\nThere are a total of 4 such permutations.\n\n<<<4>>>"
