    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Main Character:** The protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who has been resurrected in a far-distant future.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Central Relationship:** Upon his resurrection, Adam is guided, protected, and essentially \"owned\" by a powerful, ancient post-human being. This character is central to Adam's new existence and their relationship forms the core of the narrative.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Concept of \"Marriage\" in the Novel's Context:** The world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a post-human reality where concepts like physical bodies, individuality, and social contracts like marriage are vastly different from our 21st-century understanding. Relationships are more complex and often tied to power, data, and existential allegiances. A direct, traditional marriage ceremony as we know it does not occur.\n\n4.  **Identify the Character Fulfilling the \"Spouse\" Role:** The question asks who the main character marries. In the context of the story, the closest equivalent to a marital bond—a deep, binding, and fate-altering union—is the one Adam Zamoyski forms with his guide and protector. He eventually commits to her, binding his existence and future to hers in a way that transcends a simple partnership. This character's name is Angelika.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** While not a traditional marriage, the profound and binding union Adam Zamoyski forms is with Angelika. She is the character that fits the role of the person he \"marries\" within the narrative's unique framework.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Non-Traditional Context:** The most critical point is that the novel operates outside of standard human social norms. One must look for the thematic and narrative equivalent of marriage, rather than a literal one.\n*   **Protagonist Identification:** Correctly identifying Adam Zamoyski as the main character is the first essential step.\n*   **Key Relationships:** It's important to distinguish between Adam's central, defining relationship (with Angelika) and other interactions he might have. His bond with Angelika is unique in its depth and consequences.\n\nBased on this analysis, the character the main character marries is Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
