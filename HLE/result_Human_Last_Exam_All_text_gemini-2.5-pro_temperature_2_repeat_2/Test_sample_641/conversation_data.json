    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Involutions in PSU(n, q)\n\nAn involution in a group is a non-identity element `x` such that `x^2 = 1`.\nThe group in question is `G = PSU(4, 997)`. This is a quotient group, `PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where:\n*   `SU(n, q)` is the special unitary group of dimension `n` over the field extension `F_{q^2}`.\n*   `Z(SU(n, q))` is the center of `SU(n, q)`.\n\nLet `Z = Z(SU(4, 997))`. An element `gZ` in `PSU(4, 997)` is an involution if `(gZ)^2` is the identity element of `PSU` (which is `Z`), and `gZ` is not the identity element itself.\n1.  `(gZ)^2 = g^2 Z = Z \\implies g^2 \\in Z`.\n2.  `gZ \\neq Z \\implies g \\notin Z`.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` that satisfy `g^2 \\in Z` and `g \\notin Z`. The total number of such elements, divided by the size of the fiber of the projection map `SU \\to PSU` (which is `|Z|`), will give the number of involutions.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Center of SU(4, 997)\n\nThe center `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that:\n1.  `λI \\in SU(n, q)`. This means `det(λI) = λ^n = 1` and `λI` preserves the Hermitian form, which for a scalar matrix means `λ \\bar{λ} = λ^{q+1} = 1`.\n2.  Thus, `λ` must be a scalar satisfying `λ^n = 1` and `λ^{q+1} = 1`. This is equivalent to `λ^{gcd(n, q+1)} = 1`.\n\nFor our case, `n=4` and `q=997`.\n*   `q+1 = 997+1 = 998`.\n*   `gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 998) = gcd(2^2, 2 \\times 499) = 2`.\n*   So, we need `λ^2 = 1`. The solutions are `λ=1` and `λ=-1`.\nThe center is `Z = Z(SU(4, 997)) = \\{I, -I\\}`. It has size `|Z| = 2`.\n\n### Step 3: Classifying the Preimages of Involutions\n\nWe are looking for elements `g \\in SU(4, 997)` such that `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}` and `g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}`. This gives two distinct types of preimages:\n\n*   **Type A:** `g^2 = I` and `g \\neq \\pm I`. These are the \"true\" involutions within `SU(4, 997)` that are not in the center.\n*   **Type B:** `g^2 = -I`. These are elements of order 4 in `SU(4, 997)`.\n\nThe total number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `(Number of Type A elements + Number of Type B elements) / |Z|`.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Type A Elements\n\nThese are involutions in `SU(4, q)`. In a unitary group over a field of odd characteristic (997 is odd), any involution is semisimple and its eigenvalues are `+1` or `-1`. Let `k` be the dimension of the eigenspace for the eigenvalue `-1`.\n*   For an element to be in `SU(n, q)`, its determinant must be 1. The determinant is `(-1)^k`. So, `k` must be even.\n*   Here `n=4`. Possible even values for `k` are `k=0, 2, 4`.\n    *   `k=0`: The element is the identity `I`. This is in the center `Z`, so we exclude it.\n    *   `k=4`: The element is `-I`. This is also in the center `Z`, so we also exclude it.\n    *   `k=2`: The element `t_A` has two eigenvalues `+1` and two eigenvalues `-1`. `det(t_A) = (-1)^2 = 1`. `t_A \\neq \\pm I`. This is the only class of Type A elements.\n\nThe number of such elements, `N_A`, is the size of the conjugacy class of `t_A`.\n*   The size of the class is `|SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(t_A)|`.\n*   The centralizer of `t_A` in `U(4,q)` is `C_{U(4,q)}(t_A) \\cong U(2,q) \\times U(2,q)`.\n*   The number of elements is given by the formula: `N_A = |U(4,q)| / |U(2,q)|^2`.\nUsing the formula `|U(m, q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^m (q^i - (-1)^i)`:\n`N_A = (q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)) / (q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n\n### Step 5: Counting Type B Elements\n\nThese are elements `g` with `g^2 = -I`.\n*   Such elements are semisimple, and their eigenvalues must be `i` or `-i` (where `i^2=-1`). For `g` to belong to `U(n,q)`, its eigenvalues `λ` must satisfy `λ^{q+1}=1`. Here, `i^{q+1} = i^{998} = (i^2)^{499} = (-1)^{499} = -1`.\n*   An eigenvalue `λ` of a unitary matrix can only exist if its eigenspace is totally isotropic when `λ^{q+1} = -1`.\n*   For an element `g` where `g^2 = -I` to exist in `U(4,q)`, the vector space must decompose into a direct sum of two 2-dimensional totally isotropic eigenspaces (one for `i`, one for `-i`). This is possible and defines a single conjugacy class in `U(4,q)`.\n*   The determinant of such an element is `i^2(-i)^2 = (-1)(-1)=1`, so all such elements are automatically in `SU(4,q)`.\n*   The number of such elements, `N_B`, is the size of this conjugacy class.\n*   The centralizer of such an element in `SU(4,q)` is known to be isomorphic to `SL(2, q^2)`.\n*   `N_B = |SU(4,q)| / |SL(2, q^2)|`.\nUsing the formulas for group orders:\n`|SU(4,q)| = q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`.\n`|SL(2, q^2)| = (q^2)( (q^2)^2 - 1 ) = q^2(q^4-1)`.\n`N_B = (q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)) / (q^2(q^4-1)) = q^4(q^2-1)(q^3+1)`.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `(N_A + N_B) / |Z|`.\nNumber = `(N_A + N_B) / 2 = ( q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q^2-1)(q^3+1) ) / 2`\n\nLet's simplify the numerator:\n`q^4 [ (q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + (q^2-1)(q^3+1) ]`\n`= q^4 [ (q^4 - q^3 + 2q^2 - q + 1) + (q^5 - q^3 + q^2 - 1) ]`\n`= q^4 [ q^5 + q^4 - 2q^3 + 3q^2 - q ]`\n`= q^5 [ q^4 + q^3 - 2q^2 + 3q - 1 ]`\n\nLet's try a different factorization which is cleaner:\nNumerator `= q^4(q^2-q+1) [ (q^2+1) + (q+1)(q^2-1) ]`\n`= q^4(q^2-q+1) [ q^2+1 + q^3+q^2-q-1 ]`\n`= q^4(q^2-q+1) [ q^3+2q^2-q ]`\n`= q^4(q^2-q+1) q(q^2+2q-1)`\n`= q^5(q^2-q+1)(q^2+2q-1)`\n\nSo, the total number of involutions is `q^5(q^2-q+1)(q^2+2q-1) / 2`.\n\nNow we substitute `q = 997`:\nNumber = `997^5 \\times (997^2 - 997 + 1) \\times (997^2 + 2 \\times 997 - 1) / 2`\n`997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013`\n`997^2 + 1994 - 1 = 994009 + 1993 = 996002`\nNumber = `(997^5 \\times 993013 \\times 996002) / 2`\nNumber = `997^5 \\times 993013 \\times 498001`\n\nThis is the final numerical value.\n\nFinal expression for the number of involutions is `q^5(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 2q - 1) / 2`, where `q=997`.\n\n<<<997^5 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 2*997 - 1) / 2>>>"
