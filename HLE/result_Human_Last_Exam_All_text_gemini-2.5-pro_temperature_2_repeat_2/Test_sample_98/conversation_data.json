    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Object:** The tank is in the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   **The Orientation:** The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the triangular faces is perfectly horizontal and forms the base of the tank.\n*   **The Filling:** The tank is \"half-filled\" with water. This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Symmetry Principles**\n*   A regular icosahedron is a highly symmetric object. A key property is that it has a center of symmetry (also known as point symmetry or inversion symmetry). For every point on the icosahedron (vertex, edge, or face), there is an identical point on the opposite side, at the same distance from the center.\n*   Because the icosahedron is standing on a face, this symmetry implies that there is another identical triangular face on the very top of the tank, parallel to the base.\n*   For the water to fill exactly half the volume, the water level must be a horizontal plane that passes precisely through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   The question asks for the \"shape of the water surface.\" This surface is the intersection of the horizontal water level plane with the interior of the icosahedron. So, we need to find the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron through its center with a plane parallel to its base face.\n*   Let's consider the rotational symmetry. The line passing through the center of the base face and the center of the top face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. This means if you rotate the icosahedron by 120Â° around this axis, it looks exactly the same.\n*   Since the cutting plane (the water surface) is perpendicular to this axis of symmetry, the resulting shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   As established in Step 2, the shape must also be centrally symmetric because the plane passes through the center of symmetry.\n*   A polygon that possesses both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Step 4: Visualize the Cross-Section**\n*   When the icosahedron rests on a face, its 30 edges can be grouped by their orientation. There are the 3 edges of the base, 3 edges of the top, and a set of edges that are \"tilted\" relative to the horizontal plane.\n*   The horizontal plane cutting through the center of the icosahedron will intersect a specific set of 6 of these tilted edges.\n*   By the symmetry of the icosahedron, these 6 intersection points (which are the midpoints of the edges they cut) are all at the same distance from the center and are equally spaced around it.\n*   Connecting these 6 points forms a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the symmetry of the icosahedron and the condition that it is half-filled while resting on a face, the water surface forms a horizontal plane that cuts the shape through its center. This cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
