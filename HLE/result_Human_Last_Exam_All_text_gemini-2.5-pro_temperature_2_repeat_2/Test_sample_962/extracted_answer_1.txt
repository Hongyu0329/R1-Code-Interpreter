A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed based on the **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)** protocol. The design consists of three phases:

1.  **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** All `n` parties use a robust protocol like Pedersen Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) to jointly create a group public key `Y` and individual secret key shares `sk_i` without a trusted dealer. This phase prevents rogue-key attacks.

2.  **Two-Round Signing:** The signing protocol for a message `M` by `t` participants involves a pre-computation step and a two-round online phase:
    *   **Pre-computation (Offline):** Each party generates and commits to a set of one-time nonces to be used in future signings.
    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each of the `t` signers broadcasts a commitment to a fresh nonce.
    *   **Round 2 (Signing Share):** After receiving all nonce commitments, each signer calculates a "binding factor" to prevent forgery, computes a common group commitment `R` and challenge `c`, and then uses their secret s
