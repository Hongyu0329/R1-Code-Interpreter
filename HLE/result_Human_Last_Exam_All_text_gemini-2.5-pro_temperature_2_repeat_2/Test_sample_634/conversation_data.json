    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Definitions**\n\nWe are asked to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\nP1(s) = [s^2 + s, -s;\n         -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2(s) = [s, 0;\n         -s - 1, 1]\n\nA polynomial matrix `G(s)` is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if:\n1.  `G(s)` is a common right divisor of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`. This means there exist polynomial matrices `Q1(s)` and `Q2(s)` such that `P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s)` and `P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s)`.\n2.  For any other common right divisor `D(s)` of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`, `D(s)` is a right divisor of `G(s)`. This means there exists a polynomial matrix `L(s)` such that `G(s) = L(s)D(s)`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The GCRD is not unique. If `G(s)` is a GCRD, then `U(s)G(s)` is also a GCRD for any unimodular matrix `U(s)` (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). We typically look for a simple or canonical form.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n\nThe standard method is to form a stacked matrix `M(s)` and reduce it using elementary row operations. The elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nLet's form the stacked matrix `M(s)`:\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]\nM(s) = [s^2 + s,  -s    ;  (Row 1)\n         -s^2 - 1,  s^2   ;  (Row 2)\n         s,        0     ;  (Row 3)\n         -s - 1,    1     ]  (Row 4)\n\nWe will use row operations to introduce zeros, aiming to end up with a matrix of the form `[G(s); 0]`, where `G(s)` is a 2x2 matrix that will be the GCRD.\n\n**Step 3: Perform Row Reduction**\n\nThe lowest degree polynomials in the first column are in Row 3 and Row 4. Let's use Row 3 (`[s, 0]`) to eliminate the other entries in the first column.\n\n*   **R1 <- R1 - (s+1) * R3**:\n    The new Row 1 becomes `[ (s^2+s) - (s+1)s , -s - (s+1)0 ] = [ s^2+s - s^2-s , -s ] = [0, -s]`.\n*   **R2 <- R2 + s * R3**:\n    The new Row 2 becomes `[ (-s^2-1) + s*s , s^2 + s*0 ] = [ -s^2-1 + s^2 , s^2 ] = [-1, s^2]`.\n*   **R4 <- R4 + 1 * R3**:\n    The new Row 4 becomes `[ (-s-1) + s , 1 + 0 ] = [-1, 1]`.\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[ 0,    -s ]\n[ -1,   s^2]\n[ s,     0 ]\n[ -1,    1 ]\n\nLet's use the new Row 4 (`[-1, 1]`), which has a constant pivot, to simplify further. Let's make it our primary pivot row.\n\n*   **R2 <- R2 - R4**:\n    `[ -1 - (-1) , s^2 - 1 ] = [0, s^2-1]`.\n*   **R3 <- R3 + s * R4**:\n    `[ s + s(-1) , 0 + s(1) ] = [0, s]`.\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[ 0,    -s    ]\n[ 0,   s^2-1  ]\n[ 0,     s    ]\n[ -1,    1    ]\n\nNow we have only one non-zero entry in the first column. We can focus on the second column for the top three rows `[0, -s]`, `[0, s^2-1]`, and `[0, s]`. Let's use the row `[0, s]` to eliminate the others.\n\n*   **R1 <- R1 + R3**:\n    `[ 0+0 , -s+s ] = [0, 0]`.\n*   **R2 <- R2 - s * R3**:\n    `[ 0 - s*0 , (s^2-1) - s*s ] = [0, s^2-1 - s^2] = [0, -1]`.\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[ 0,     0  ]\n[ 0,    -1  ]\n[ 0,     s  ]\n[ -1,    1  ]\n\nThe non-zero rows are `[0, -1]`, `[0, s]`, and `[-1, 1]`. Let's use the row `[0, -1]` to eliminate the `s` in `[0, s]`.\n\n*   **R3 <- R3 + s * R2**:\n    `[ 0 + s*0, s + s*(-1) ] = [0, 0]`.\n\nNow, use `[0, -1]` to simplify `[-1, 1]`.\n*   **R4 <- R4 + R2**:\n    `[-1 + 0, 1 + (-1)] = [-1, 0]`.\n\nThe matrix of non-zero rows has been reduced to:\n[ 0, -1 ]\n[ -1, 0 ]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the GCRD**\n\nWe can arrange the remaining independent non-zero rows to form the GCRD.\nG_candidate(s) = [-1, 0 ;\n                  0, -1 ]\n\nThis matrix is ` -I ` (the negative of the identity matrix). Let's check its determinant: det(G_candidate) = (-1)(-1) - (0)(0) = 1. Since the determinant is a non-zero constant, this matrix is unimodular.\n\n**Careful Point:** A unimodular matrix that is a common right divisor is always a GCRD. Furthermore, if any GCRD is unimodular, then the original matrices `P1` and `P2` are called **right coprime**.\n\nSince `G_candidate = -I` is a GCRD, and the GCRD is only unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix, we can multiply our result by `U = -I` (which is itself unimodular) to get an even simpler form.\nG(s) = U * G_candidate(s) = (-I) * (-I) = I.\n\nLet's choose the identity matrix `I` as our final answer, as it's the simplest canonical form.\nG(s) = [1, 0;\n        0, 1]\n\n**Step 5: Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nWe verify if `I` is a GCRD.\n1.  **Common Right Divisor?**\n    *   `P1(s) = Q1(s) * I`. This implies `Q1(s) = P1(s)`. Since `P1(s)` is a polynomial matrix, `I` is a right divisor of `P1(s)`.\n    *   `P2(s) = Q2(s) * I`. This implies `Q2(s) = P2(s)`. Since `P2(s)` is a polynomial matrix, `I` is a right divisor of `P2(s)`.\n    Thus, `I` is a common right divisor.\n\n2.  **Greatest?**\n    *   Since `I` is unimodular (det(I) = 1), any other common right divisor `D(s)` must be a right divisor of `I`. This fulfills the definition of a GCRD.\n\nThe calculations confirm that `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` are right coprime and their GCRD can be represented by the identity matrix.\n\nFinal Answer: The greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n```\n[1, 0;\n 0, 1]\n```\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
