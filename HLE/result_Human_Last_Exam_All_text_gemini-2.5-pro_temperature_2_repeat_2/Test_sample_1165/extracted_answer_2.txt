The magnitude of fluctuations for the uniform case scales as $R \propto \epsilon^{1/2}$.

Yes, the scaling for $R(\epsilon)$ is expected to change if $z_i$ are drawn from $\mathcal{N}(i, 0.5)$. In the case of the Normal distribution, the points $z_i$ are independent and much more localized than in the uniform case. This increased regularity significantly dampens the fluctuations. The calculation shows that for the Normal distribution case, the magnitude of fluctuations scales as $R \propto \epsilon^{3/2}$.
