    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question centers on the poem \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\" by James Russell Lowell.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The key phrase is \"preserved alongside,\" which points to a specific edition or publication where the poem was included with another work. The other work is specified as a \"book of manners.\" This suggests we are not looking for the original 1848 publication of the poem, but a later, likely educational, compilation.\n\n3.  **Investigate Publication History:** Research reveals that \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\" was widely distributed for educational purposes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as part of the *Riverside Literature Series*, published by Houghton, Mifflin and Company. These editions were designed for schoolroom use.\n\n4.  **Find the Combined Volume:** Publishers in this era often bound separate booklets from a series into a single, more durable volume for students. Lowell's poem, which was Number 30 in the *Riverside Literature Series*, was frequently paired with other texts.\n\n5.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** A common and well-documented pairing involved binding Lowell's poems with a specific guide on etiquette from the same series. This guide was titled *How to Teach Manners in the School-room*.\n\n6.  **Identify the Author of the Second Book:** The author of *How to Teach Manners in the School-room* was Julia M. Dewey.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The poem \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\" was preserved in a combined school edition alongside Julia M. Dewey's etiquette guide, *How to Teach Manners in the School-room*. This pairing was part of the *Riverside Literature Series* and aimed to provide students with instruction in both literature and proper conduct.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The term \"preserved alongside\" specifically refers to the physical binding of two separate works into one book.\n*   The context is crucial: this was not a literary anthology but an educational compilation for schools.\n*   The title of the book of manners is specific; simply stating \"a book on etiquette\" would be incomplete.\n\n<<<How to Teach Manners in the School-room>>>"
