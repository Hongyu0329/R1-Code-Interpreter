No, it is not true. The second postulate is not superfluous and cannot be derived from the first postulate alone. Applying the first postulate to Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism does imply that the speed of light must be constant, but this hinges on the crucial, non-trivial assumption that Maxwell's equations have a universal form, which was precisely the point of conflict with classical mechanics. The second postulate is an independent, physical statement that resolves this conflict by elevating the constant speed of light to a fundamental principle, thereby defining the geometric structure of spacetime for our specific universe.
