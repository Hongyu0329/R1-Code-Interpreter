    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and the Ensemble**\n\n*   **Grand Canonical Ensemble:** This ensemble is used for systems that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir. It is characterized by a constant temperature $T$ (or inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$), volume $V$, and chemical potential $\\mu$.\n*   **Partition Function (Z):** The grand canonical partition function is defined as the trace over all states of the statistical operator:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}} - \\mu \\hat{N})}\\right]$\n    where $\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}}$ is the system's Hamiltonian and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   **Interpreting the Given Hamiltonian:** The question specifies a \"Hamiltonian H^=−μN^\". This is slightly ambiguous. We will adopt the most direct interpretation: the full operator appearing in the exponent of the grand canonical statistical operator is given by $\\hat{K} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. This implies that the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}}$, is zero, and the system consists of non-interacting particles with zero single-particle energy.\n    So, we need to calculate:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[e^{-\\beta(-\\mu\\hat{N})}\\right] = \\text{Tr}\\left[e^{\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}}\\right]$\n\n**2. Formulate the Path Integral**\n\n*   The partition function $Z$ can be expressed as a path integral over fields ($\\psi, \\bar{\\psi}$ for fermions, or $\\phi, \\phi^*$ for bosons), which are functions of imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$.\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\text{fields}] \\, e^{-S_E}$\n*   The Euclidean action $S_E$ is derived from the grand canonical operator $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}} - \\mu\\hat{N}$. For non-interacting particles, the action can be written as:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\left( \\bar{\\psi}_k \\partial_\\tau \\psi_k + h_{\\text{sys}}(\\bar{\\psi}_k, \\psi_k) - \\mu \\bar{\\psi}_k \\psi_k \\right)$\n    where the index $k$ runs over all available single-particle states. Since this number is not specified, we will denote it by $M$.\n*   In our case, $\\hat{H}_{\\text{sys}} = 0$, which means its field representation $h_{\\text{sys}}$ is also zero. The action simplifies to:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_{k=1}^M \\bar{\\psi}_k (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi_k$\n*   Because the action is a sum of terms for each single-particle state $k$, the path integral factorizes:\n    $Z = \\prod_{k=1}^M Z_k$, where $Z_k = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}_k, \\psi_k] e^{-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\bar{\\psi}_k (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi_k}$\n\n**3. Evaluate the Path Integral for Different Statistics**\n\nThe evaluation of $Z_k$ depends on whether the particles are fermions or bosons.\n\n*   **Case 1: Fermions**\n    *   The fields $\\psi_k, \\bar{\\psi}_k$ are independent Grassmann variables.\n    *   The path integral is a functional determinant: $Z_k = \\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$.\n    *   This is a standard result for fermionic fields that are anti-periodic in imaginary time ($\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$). The evaluation yields:\n        $Z_k = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n    *   This matches the standard statistical mechanics result for a single fermionic state with energy $\\epsilon_k=0$: $Z_k = \\sum_{n=0,1} e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k n - \\mu n)} = e^0 + e^{\\beta\\mu} = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$.\n    *   For $M$ identical, independent states, the total partition function is:\n        $Z_F = \\prod_{k=1}^M (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}) = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\n*   **Case 2: Bosons**\n    *   The fields $\\phi_k, \\phi^*_k$ are complex-valued functions.\n    *   The path integral is the inverse of a functional determinant: $Z_k = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1}$.\n    *   This is a standard result for bosonic fields that are periodic in imaginary time ($\\phi(\\beta) = \\phi(0)$). The evaluation yields:\n        $Z_k = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\n    *   **Careful Point:** This result is only valid if the geometric series used in its derivation converges, which requires $|e^{\\beta\\mu}| < 1$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this implies $\\mu < 0$. If $\\mu \\ge 0$, the partition function diverges.\n    *   This matches the standard statistical mechanics result for a single bosonic state with energy $\\epsilon_k=0$: $Z_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_k n - \\mu n)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (e^{\\beta\\mu})^n = \\frac{1}{1-e^{\\beta\\mu}}$.\n    *   For $M$ identical, independent states, the total partition function is:\n        $Z_B = \\prod_{k=1}^M \\left(\\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}\\right) = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$ (for $\\mu < 0$)\n\n**4. Final Answer Formulation**\n\nWe can write a single expression that covers both fermions and bosons by introducing a statistical parameter $\\zeta$:\n*   $\\zeta = -1$ for Fermions\n*   $\\zeta = +1$ for Bosons\n\nThe partition function for a single mode can be written as $(1 - \\zeta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\zeta}$.\n*   For fermions ($\\zeta=-1$): $(1 - (-1)e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-(-1)} = (1+e^{\\beta\\mu})^1$. Correct.\n*   For bosons ($\\zeta=+1$): $(1 - (+1)e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-(1)} = (1-e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$. Correct.\n\nFor a system with $M$ such single-particle states, the total partition function is the product over all states.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z for a system with grand canonical operator $\\hat{K} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$ and M available single-particle states is given by:\n$Z = \\left[ (1 - \\zeta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\zeta} \\right]^M$\nwhere:\n*   $M$ is the number of single-particle states.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\zeta$ is a statistical parameter:\n    *   $\\zeta = -1$ for fermions.\n    *   $\\zeta = +1$ for bosons (with the condition that $\\mu < 0$ for the result to be well-defined).\n\nExpanding this general form:\n*   For **Fermions**: $Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$\n*   For **Bosons**: $Z_B = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$, (valid for $\\mu < 0$)\n\n<<<The partition function Z is given by $Z = \\left[(1 - \\zeta e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-\\zeta}\\right]^M$, where M is the number of single-particle states, $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\zeta=-1$ for fermions and $\\zeta=+1$ for bosons. For bosons, this expression is valid only for $\\mu < 0$.>>>"
