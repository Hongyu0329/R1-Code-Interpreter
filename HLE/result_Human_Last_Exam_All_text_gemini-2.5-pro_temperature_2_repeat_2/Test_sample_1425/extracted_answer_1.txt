The partition function Z is given by $Z = \left[(1 - \zeta e^{\beta\mu})^{-\zeta}\right]^M$, where M is the number of single-particle states, $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\zeta=-1$ for fermions and $\zeta=+1$ for bosons. For bosons, this expression is valid only for $\mu < 0$.
