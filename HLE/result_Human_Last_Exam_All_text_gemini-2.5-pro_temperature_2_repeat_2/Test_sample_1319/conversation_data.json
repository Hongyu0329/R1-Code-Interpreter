    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The objective is to find the tallest *historical* (i.e., real, physical) mountain that is explicitly mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, second only to Mount Olympus.\n\n2.  **List Candidate Mountains from the Iliad:** First, we must identify the mountains mentioned in the epic poem. The most prominent ones include:\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods. It is the tallest mountain in Greece and serves as the benchmark we must surpass. (Book 1, Line 498-499 and throughout).\n    *   **Mount Ida:** Located near Troy (in modern-day Turkey), this is a critical location from which Zeus and other gods observe the battle. (Book 8, Line 47-48). It is now known as Kaz Dağı.\n    *   **The Peak of Samothrace:** Poseidon sits on the highest peak of the island of Samothrace to watch the Trojan War, as it provides a clear line of sight to the Trojan plain. The peak is now called Mount Fengari. (Book 13, Line 10-14).\n    *   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, Hera undertakes a journey from Olympus to Lemnos. The narrator describes her flight path: \"...over the snowy mountains of the horse-rearing Thracians, skimming their topmost crests... From Athos she crossed the plunging sea...\". This explicitly names Mount Athos. (Book 14, Line 225-230).\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain is mentioned as the source of the ash wood for the great spear that was gifted to Achilles's father, Peleus. (Book 16, Line 143-144).\n\n3.  **Gather Elevation Data for Each Mountain:** To determine which is the tallest, we need to find their modern elevations.\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft). This is the tallest but is excluded from being the final answer.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 ft).\n    *   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft).\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft).\n    *   **Peak of Samothrace (Mount Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft).\n\n4.  **Compare the Elevations:** Now, we compare the elevations of the candidate mountains, excluding Mount Olympus.\n    *   Mount Athos: **2,033 m**\n    *   Mount Ida: 1,774 m\n    *   Mount Pelion: 1,624 m\n    *   Mount Samothrace: 1,611 m\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The comparison clearly shows that Mount Athos, at 2,033 meters, is the tallest among the historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Distinguishing the Two \"Mount Idas\":** It's important to focus on the Mount Ida near Troy, which is central to the *Iliad*, and not the Mount Ida in Crete, which is more associated with the mythology of Zeus's birth.\n*   **Brief vs. Central Mentions:** While Mount Ida and Samothrace play more central roles as observation posts for the gods, Mount Athos is still explicitly named in the text as part of a significant character's journey (Hera's). The question asks for mountains *mentioned*, not only those with a central narrative function.\n*   **Historical vs. Mythological:** The question specifies \"historical mountain,\" and all the candidates listed are real geographical locations that can be found on a map today, validating their inclusion.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus is Mount Athos.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
