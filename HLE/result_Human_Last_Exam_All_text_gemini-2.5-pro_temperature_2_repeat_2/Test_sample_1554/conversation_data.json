    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the philosopher in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific philosopher who meets three criteria:\n1.  They belong to the **Lviv-Warsaw School** of philosophy.\n2.  They analyzed the concept of a **\"hallmark\"**.\n3.  They decomposed this concept into two sub-categories: **\"symptoms\"** and **\"signals\"**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nThe Lviv-Warsaw School was a highly influential movement in Polish philosophy and logic from the 1920s to the 1940s. Its members were known for their commitment to clarity, logical rigor, and the precise analysis of language, science, and knowledge. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This focus on analytical clarity makes the school a likely source for the kind of fine-grained conceptual distinction mentioned in the question.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Concepts: Hallmark, Symptom, and Signal**\nThis conceptual trio is a part of semiotics (the theory of signs) and epistemology (the theory of knowledge).\n*   **Hallmark (Polish: *oznaka*)**: This is a general term for any object, event, or property (X) whose observation provides a reason to believe in the existence of another object, event, or property (Y). It is an indicator or a mark.\n*   **Symptom (Polish: *symptom*)**: This is a specific type of hallmark. The relationship between the symptom (X) and what it indicates (Y) is a **natural** or **causal** one. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire. The connection exists independently of human conventions.\n*   **Signal (Polish: *sygnał*)**: This is the other type of hallmark. The relationship between the signal (X) and what it indicates (Y) is **conventional** or **intentional**. The meaning is established by agreement, rules, or the intention of an agent. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop. Words are signals for their meanings.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Concepts to the Philosophers of the School**\nNow, we must identify which member of the Lviv-Warsaw School is known for making this particular distinction.\n*   While Tadeusz Kotarbiński and other members worked on language and meaning, this specific framework is a well-known part of the epistemological and semiotic work of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n*   Ajdukiewicz developed this distinction as part of his analysis of how we justify beliefs and understand meaning. He was deeply interested in the structure of scientific language and reasoning. For him, recognizing whether a hallmark was a natural symptom or a conventional signal was crucial for understanding the basis of our inferences and knowledge claims. He used this distinction extensively in works like *Pragmatic Logic* and other essays on epistemology.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who introduced the distinction between symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) as two types of a broader category called \"hallmark\" (*oznaka*) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
