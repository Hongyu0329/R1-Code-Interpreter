    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the person in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** The question provides several specific clues:\n    *   The interpretation comes from a scholar named **Veronika Campan**.\n    *   The person in question is a male figure, referred to as \"HE\".\n    *   The topic is discussed at the **\"end of HIS work\"**.\n    *   The specific issue is **\"another's material possessions\"**.\n    *   His method involves **\"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **\"Another's material possessions\"**: This is a direct reference to the Tenth Commandment of the Decalogue: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... nor anything that is your neighbor's.\" This commandment is located at the *end* of the traditional list of ten.\n    *   **\"Prohibition against representation\"**: This is a clear reference to the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself a carved imageâ€”any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\" This commandment is about forbidding idols and images.\n    *   **\"At the end of HIS work\"**: This aligns perfectly with the fact that the discussion of coveting material possessions (the Tenth Commandment) occurs at the end of the Decalogue. The \"work\" in question is likely a commentary or analysis of the Ten Commandments.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Clues:** The core of the puzzle is the connection between the last commandment (coveting possessions) and the second commandment (idolatry/representation). The person \"HE\" argues that the ultimate form of idolatry is not the physical creation of a statue, but the very act of desiring or coveting something. When you covet your neighbor's goods, you make those goods into an idol. This is a sophisticated theological or philosophical interpretation that redefines the \"prohibition against representation\" not as a ban on physical images, but as a ban on the idolatrous desire that \"represents\" a mere object as the ultimate good.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Thinker:**\n    *   The key to solving this is the scholar **Veronika Campan**. Searching for her work in relation to these themes (idolatry, representation, Ten Commandments, coveting) points directly to her analysis of the French phenomenologist and theologian **Jean-Luc Marion**.\n    *   Veronika Campan has written about Marion's interpretation of the Decalogue. Marion, particularly in works like *The Erotic Phenomenon*, argues that the last commandment against coveting is the ultimate explication of the first two commandments against false gods and idols.\n    *   For Marion, idolatry is fundamentally about the human gaze or consciousness intending an object that it can master and possess. Coveting another's material possessions is the paradigm of this idolatrous desire. This fits the clue of \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\" because Marion's focus is on the idolatry of *desire*, not the physical act of carving an idol.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The person \"HE\" whose work is being interpreted by Veronika Campan is Jean-Luc Marion. His analysis of the Tenth Commandment at the end of the Decalogue serves as a reinterpretation of the prohibition against idolatry.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the full name of the person (\"HE\") is identified.\n\n<<<Jean-Luc Marion>>>"
