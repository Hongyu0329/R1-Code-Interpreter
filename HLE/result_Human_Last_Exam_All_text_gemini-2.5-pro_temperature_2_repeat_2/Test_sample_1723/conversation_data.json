    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the genus of mushroom known for its blue spore print.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept of a spore print.**\nA spore print is a critical tool for mushroom identification. It is the colored deposit of spores left behind when a mushroom cap is placed on a surface (like paper). The color of the spores is a stable genetic characteristic and is a key diagnostic feature, unlike the color of the cap or gills which can change with age or environmental conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the rarity of blue coloration in spore prints.**\nMost mushrooms produce spores in a limited range of colors. The most common spore print colors are shades of white, cream, pink, yellow, olive, brown, purple-brown, and black. A truly blue spore print is exceptionally rare in the fungal kingdom, making the genus that produces it unique and noteworthy.\n\n**Step 3: Differentiate between spore color and other blue coloration in mushrooms.**\nA crucial point to consider is the difference between the color of the spores and the color changes in the mushroom's flesh. Many species of mushrooms, particularly in the genera *Boletus* and *Psilocybe*, exhibit a \"bluing\" reaction. When the mushroom's flesh is cut or bruised, it quickly turns blue or blue-green due to the oxidation of certain compounds. However, this is a chemical reaction in the flesh (mycelium) and has no bearing on the color of the spores. For instance, most bluing boletes have an olive-brown spore print, and *Psilocybe* species have a purple-brown to black spore print. The question specifically asks about the *spore print* color.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific genus.**\nThrough mycological research and documentation, the single genus known to contain species that produce a distinctly blue (or lavender-blue to sky-blue) spore print is **Lactarius**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the exemplar species within the genus.**\nThe most famous example and the one that definitively confirms this characteristic for the genus is *Lactarius indigo*, commonly known as the blue milk mushroom. This mushroom is entirely blue, bleeds blue latex-like \"milk\" when cut, and, most importantly for this question, deposits a spore print that is a beautiful sky-blue or lavender-blue. Other related species, like *Lactarius paradoxus*, also have this feature. These species belong to a specific section within the genus (*Lactarius* section *Deliciosi*, subsection *Caerulei*), but the question asks for the genus name itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the specific requirement for a blue spore print and differentiating it from the more common phenomenon of blue bruising, we can pinpoint a single genus. This genus is *Lactarius*, famously represented by the species *Lactarius indigo*.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
