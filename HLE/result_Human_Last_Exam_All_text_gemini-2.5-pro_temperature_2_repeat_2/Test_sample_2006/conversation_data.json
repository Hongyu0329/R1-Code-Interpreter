    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **The Title as a Clue:** The title of the haiku is \"The Bays\". This is phonetically similar to \"The B's\". This strongly suggests the answer is a list of words that start with the letter 'B'.\n2.  **The Haiku's Structure:** The poem is a haiku, with three lines. It is logical to assume that each line provides a clue for one of the 'B' words. The entire poem centers on a theme of wind and storms.\n3.  **The Final Instruction:** The instruction specifies that the answer should be presented \"in alphabetical order\". This confirms that we are looking for a list of words, which must then be sorted alphabetically to get the final answer.\n\n**List of Careful Points**\n\n*   The pun in the title (\"The Bays\" -> \"The B's\") is the primary key to understanding the puzzle.\n*   Each line must be deciphered to find a word starting with 'B'.\n*   The clues are metaphorical and require some domain knowledge (meteorology, mythology).\n*   \"Twice fifteen\" is a numerical clue (30) that needs to be connected to the theme.\n*   The final sorting of the answer words is a critical and explicit instruction.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   A \"tempest\" is a violent, windy storm.\n    *   The strength of such winds is measured on a specific scale.\n    *   This scale is the **Beaufort** scale. This gives us our first 'B' word.\n\n2.  **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" mathematically equals 30 (2 x 15 = 30).\n    *   The line connects this number to \"winds of change\". In meteorology, changes in atmospheric pressure bring wind.\n    *   Atmospheric pressure is measured with a **barometer**. Standard sea-level pressure is 29.92 inches of mercury, which is commonly rounded to 30. A reading of 30 is a baseline from which changes (and thus, winds) are observed. This gives us our second 'B' word.\n\n3.  **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   \"A divine one\" points to a god or mythological entity.\n    *   \"Yields\" means to produce or provide. In this context, it means yielding wind.\n    *   In Greek mythology, **Boreas** is the god of the north wind. He is a \"divine one\" who \"yields\" wind. This gives us our third 'B' word.\n\n4.  **Assemble and Sort the Answer**\n    *   We have found three words starting with 'B': Beaufort, Barometer, Boreas.\n    *   The final step is to put them in alphabetical order as instructed.\n    *   Alphabetical order:\n        1.  Barometer\n        2.  Beaufort\n        3.  Boreas\n\n<<<Barometer, Beaufort, Boreas>>>"
