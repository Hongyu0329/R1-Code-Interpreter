    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Components of the Question**\nThe question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a very specific item under specific conditions:\n*   **Item:** A single-dose container ampule.\n*   **Action:** From the time of puncture (i.e., opening).\n*   **Environment:** In a sterile environment (implying an ISO Class 5 or better environment, such as a laminar airflow workbench).\n\n**Step 2: Define and Differentiate the Key Terms**\n*   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** This is the date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) must not be used, stored, or transported. It is determined by the potential for microbial contamination.\n*   **Single-Dose Container:** A container intended for a single use for a single patient. It lacks an antimicrobial preservative.\n*   **Ampule:** A specific type of single-dose container made of glass. It is hermetically sealed and must be broken at the neck to be opened. Crucially, once opened, an ampule **cannot be resealed**. This makes it an \"open system.\"\n*   **Vial:** Another type of container that is often confused with an ampule. A vial has a rubber stopper that can be punctured with a needle and which reseals itself after the needle is withdrawn.\n\n**Step 3: Consult the Authoritative Standard (USP <797>)**\nThe standards for sterile compounding, including the assignment of BUDs, are set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations.\"\n\n**Step 4: Apply the USP <797> Guideline to an Ampule**\nThe nature of the ampule is the most critical point here. Because an ampule must be broken to be opened, it becomes an open container that is fully exposed to the surrounding environment (even within the sterile hood). It cannot be closed or sealed again.\n\nBecause of this, USP <797> is very explicit and strict regarding opened ampules. The guideline states that:\n*   Opened ampules must **not** be stored for any period.\n*   The contents must be used immediately.\n*   Any unused contents from an opened ampule must be discarded immediately.\n\n**Step 5: Differentiate from a Single-Dose Vial**\nIt is important not to apply the rule for a single-dose *vial* to an ampule. According to the updated USP <797> guidelines (effective late 2023), a single-dose *vial* (with a rubber stopper) that has been punctured within an ISO Class 5 environment can be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, provided it is stored under appropriate conditions. This rule applies **only** to vials because the stopper largely maintains a closed system. This rule does **not** apply to ampules.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe question is about an **ampule**, not a vial. An opened ampule is an open system and cannot be stored. Therefore, there is no storage BUD. The expectation is for immediate use, followed by the immediate discarding of the ampule and any remaining drug.\n\n<<<The opened ampule and any unused contents must be discarded immediately. They cannot be stored for any period of time."
