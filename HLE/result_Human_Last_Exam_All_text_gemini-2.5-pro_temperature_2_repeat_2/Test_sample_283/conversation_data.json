    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the structure of a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix and the data accessed during matrix multiplication.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the HSS Tree Structure**\n\nThe problem specifies a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a **depth of 4**. In the context of binary trees for hierarchical matrices, this means there are 4 levels of partitioning below the root. We can label the levels from 0 (the root) to 4 (the leaves).\n\n*   **Tree Levels:** The tree has 5 levels in total: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n*   **Tree Type:** It is a full binary tree, where each internal node has exactly two children.\n*   **Leaf Nodes:** The leaves are the nodes at the deepest level (level 4). The number of leaf nodes is `2^depth = 2^4 = 16`.\n*   **Internal Nodes:** These are all nodes that are not leaves (i.e., they are parents to other nodes). They exist at levels 0, 1, 2, and 3. The number of internal nodes is `2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15`.\n*   **Non-Root Nodes:** These are all nodes except the root (at level 0). Their levels are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The number of non-root nodes is `2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Submatrices in a Single HSS Representation**\n\nAn HSS matrix is not stored as a full matrix. Instead, it is stored as a collection of smaller submatrices (generators) defined by the tree structure. A common and efficient HSS representation consists of four types of submatrices: `D`, `B`, `R`, and `W`.\n\n1.  **`D` submatrices (Diagonal Blocks):** These are the actual matrix blocks on the diagonal at the finest level of partitioning. They correspond to the **leaf nodes** of the HSS tree.\n    *   Number of `D` submatrices = Number of leaf nodes = **16**.\n\n2.  **`B` submatrices (Coupling Generators):** For each **internal node**, the matrix block associated with it is partitioned into a 2x2 structure. The two off-diagonal blocks of this structure are compressed. Each compressed off-diagonal block requires a `B` generator. Thus, for each internal node, we have two `B` submatrices.\n    *   Number of `B` submatrices = 2 × (Number of internal nodes) = 2 × 15 = **30**.\n\n3.  **`R` and `W` submatrices (Basis Transfer Generators):** These matrices are used to efficiently represent the bases for the row and column spaces at each node. For each **non-root node**, a transfer matrix `R` (for row bases) and a transfer matrix `W` (for column bases) are stored to relate the basis of the node to the basis of its parent.\n    *   Number of `R` and `W` submatrices = 2 × (Number of non-root nodes) = 2 × 30 = **60**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Submatrices for a Single HSS Matrix**\n\nThe total number of submatrices required to represent a single HSS matrix is the sum of the counts from Step 2.\n*   Total submatrices per matrix = (Number of `D`s) + (Number of `B`s) + (Number of `R`s and `W`s)\n*   Total submatrices per matrix = 16 + 30 + 60 = **106**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Submatrices Accessed During Multiplication**\n\nA matrix multiplication operation, `C = A * B`, takes the HSS representations of matrix `A` and matrix `B` as input. To perform the computation, the algorithm must access all the component submatrices of both input matrices.\n*   Submatrices from `A` accessed = 106.\n*   Submatrices from `B` accessed = 106.\n*   Total submatrices accessed = (Submatrices from `A`) + (Submatrices from `B`)\n*   Total submatrices accessed = 106 + 106 = **212**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{212}$.\n<<<212>>>"
