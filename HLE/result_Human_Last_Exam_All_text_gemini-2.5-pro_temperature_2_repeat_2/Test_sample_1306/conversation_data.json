    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting the question\nThe question asks for the percentage of irreducible objects among all indecomposable objects in the category $C$ of finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity.\n\nThe phrase \"what percentage\" implies that we are dealing with a finite number of objects (up to isomorphism). If there were infinitely many objects of both types (irreducible and indecomposable), the question would be ill-defined unless a specific method for taking a limit is provided.\n\nThe algebra $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, often called the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group, has infinitely many non-isomorphic simple modules and infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable modules when $q$ is a root of unity. Therefore, the question must refer to a related, but different algebra for which the number of indecomposable representations is finite.\n\nThe notation $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ (with a lowercase 'u') is commonly used for Lusztig's \"small\" quantum group, which is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra obtained as a quotient of $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. We will proceed under this standard interpretation.\n\n### Step 2: The small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$\nLet $q$ be a primitive $l'$-th root of unity. For the structure theory of quantum $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$, the relevant parameter is $e$, the smallest positive integer such that $[e]_q = \\frac{q^e - q^{-e}}{q - q^{-1}} = 0$. For $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$, we have:\n$[1]_q = 1$\n$[2]_q = q+q^{-1} = -1$\n$[3]_q = q^2+1+q^{-2} = q^2+1+q = 0$.\nSo $e=3$. In much of the literature, the order of $q^2$ is used, which is also 3. Let's denote this by $l=3$.\n\nThe small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is the algebra generated by $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ with the usual $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ relations, plus the relations $E^l=0$, $F^l=0$, and $K^l=1$. For our case, $l=3$.\n\nThis algebra is finite-dimensional (of dimension $l^3=27$), and its representation theory is well-studied. Crucially, for $l=3$, it is of **finite representation type**, meaning there is only a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n\n### Step 3: Classification of modules and block decomposition\nThe category of modules over $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ decomposes into a direct sum of subcategories called blocks. For $l=3$ (an odd integer), the representation category of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ has two blocks.\nThis is because there is an outer automorphism of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ given by $K \\mapsto -K, E \\mapsto E, F \\mapsto F$, which is of order 2. This leads to a decomposition into two blocks, say $B_0$ (the principal block) and $B_1$ (the non-principal or \"twisted\" block). The two blocks are Morita equivalent, meaning they have the same representation-theoretic structure (same number of simple objects, same number of indecomposable objects, same Auslander-Reiten quiver, etc.).\n\nSo, we can find the number of irreducible and indecomposable objects by analyzing one block and then multiplying by two.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the principal block\nLet's analyze the principal block $B_0$.\nThe simple (irreducible) modules in the principal block are well-known. They are denoted $L_1$ and $L_2$ (or $L(1)$ and $L(2)$ in some notations).\n*   $L_1$ is the trivial module of dimension 1.\n*   $L_2$ is a 2-dimensional module.\nSo there are **2 simple objects** in the principal block.\n\nThe classification of all indecomposable modules for this block is a classical result. The principal block of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $l=3$ is Morita equivalent to the path algebra of the \"preprojective quiver of type $A_2$\". The indecomposable modules for this algebra have been classified. There are exactly **8 indecomposable modules** in the principal block. This list of 8 modules includes the 2 simple modules $L_1, L_2$, their projective covers $P_1, P_2$ (which are indecomposable but not simple), and four other indecomposable modules of intermediate dimensions.\n\n### Step 5: Counting across all blocks\nNow we use the block decomposition to count all objects in the category $C$.\nThe category $C$ is the direct sum of modules from all blocks.\n$C = B_0 \\oplus B_1$.\n\n**Block $B_0$ (Principal block):**\n*   Number of irreducible objects: 2\n*   Number of indecomposable objects: 8\n\n**Block $B_1$ (Twisted block):**\nSince $B_1$ is Morita equivalent to $B_0$, it has the same number of objects.\n*   Number of irreducible objects: 2\n*   Number of indecomposable objects: 8\n\n**Total for the entire category $C$:**\nTo find the total number of objects, we sum the numbers from each block.\n*   Total number of irreducible objects = (Irreducibles in $B_0$) + (Irreducibles in $B_1$) = 2 + 2 = 4.\n*   Total number of indecomposable objects = (Indecomposables in $B_0$) + (Indecomposables in $B_1$) = 8 + 8 = 16.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the percentage\nThe percentage of objects of $C$ that are irreducible is the ratio of the total number of irreducible objects to the total number of indecomposable objects.\n\nPercentage = $\\frac{\\text{Total number of irreducible objects}}{\\text{Total number of indecomposable objects}} \\times 100\\%$\nPercentage = $\\frac{4}{16} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100\\% = 25\\%$\n\nThus, 25% of the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ (interpreted as the small quantum group) are irreducible.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Algebra interpretation as small quantum group $u_q$ seems required for the question to be well-posed.\n*   For $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$, the relevant parameter $l$ (order of $q^2$) is 3.\n*   $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $l=3$ is of finite representation type.\n*   The number of blocks is 2, and they are Morita equivalent.\n*   The principal block contains 2 simple modules and 8 indecomposable modules in total.\n*   Summing over the two blocks gives 4 simple modules and 16 indecomposable modules in total for the category $C$.\n*   The ratio is $4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25$. The logic is sound based on established results in quantum group representation theory.\n\nThe final answer is 25%."
