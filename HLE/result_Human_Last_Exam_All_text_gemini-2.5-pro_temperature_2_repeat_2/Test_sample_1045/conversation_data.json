    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Molecular Composition**\n\nFirst, we need to know the chemical formula of toluene to determine the number and type of atoms present.\n*   Molecule: Toluene\n*   Chemical Formula: C₇H₈\n*   This means the molecule consists of **7 Carbon (C) atoms** and **8 Hydrogen (H) atoms**.\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation**\n\nThe Pople-style basis set notation `6-31G` provides instructions on how to represent the atomic orbitals of each atom. Let's break it down:\n\n*   The question asks for the number of **contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs)**. A CGF is a fixed linear combination of one or more primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). We need to count these CGFs, not the PGFs.\n*   **Core Orbitals (e.g., 1s orbital of Carbon):** The number before the hyphen (`6`) indicates that each core atomic orbital is described by a single CGF, which in turn is built from 6 PGFs. So, for each core orbital, there is **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (e.g., 2s and 2p of Carbon, 1s of Hydrogen):** The numbers after the hyphen (`31`) describe the valence orbitals. This is a \"split-valence\" basis set, meaning the valence region is described by two basis functions of different sizes.\n    *   The `3` indicates an \"inner\" valence basis function, which is one CGF (built from 3 PGFs).\n    *   The `1` indicates an \"outer\" valence basis function, which is one CGF (built from 1 PGF).\n    *   Therefore, each valence atomic orbital is represented by **2 CGFs** (one inner, one outer).\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Number of CGFs per Atom**\n\nNow, we apply this understanding to each type of atom in toluene.\n\n#### **For a single Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   Atomic Number: 1. Electron configuration: 1s¹.\n*   Hydrogen has **no core electrons**. Its single 1s electron is a valence electron.\n*   The 1s valence orbital is split according to the `31G` rule:\n    *   Inner 1s' function: **1 CGF**\n    *   Outer 1s'' function: **1 CGF**\n*   **Total CGFs for one H atom = 1 + 1 = 2**\n\n#### **For a single Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   Atomic Number: 6. Electron configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core Orbital:** Carbon has one core orbital (1s).\n    *   1s orbital: **1 CGF**\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** Carbon has four valence orbitals (one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals: 2px, 2py, 2pz). Each of these is split into two functions.\n    *   Inner valence functions (2s', 2px', 2py', 2pz'): 1 CGF for 2s' + 3 CGFs for 2p' = **4 CGFs**\n    *   Outer valence functions (2s'', 2px'', 2py'', 2pz''): 1 CGF for 2s'' + 3 CGFs for 2p'' = **4 CGFs**\n*   **Total CGFs for one C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9**\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of CGFs for Toluene (C₇H₈)**\n\nFinally, we sum the contributions from all atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:** There are 7 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Total CGFs from C = 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:** There are 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total CGFs from H = 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**\n*   **Total for the molecule:** Sum the contributions from all atoms.\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = **79**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions used in a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C₇H₈) is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
