    "**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine its Rank**\n    *   **Description:** The flag of Denmark is a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is composed of a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe.\n    *   **Matrix Representation:** To analyze the flag using linear algebra, we represent it as a matrix. We assign a unique numerical value to each color to maximize the rank, as per the problem's assumption. Let's say Red = `R` and White = `W`, where `R ≠ W`.\n    *   **Row Analysis:** Let's consider the different types of rows in this matrix.\n        *   Rows that are entirely within the red field but are intersected by the white vertical bar of the cross. These rows will look like `[R, R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R]`. All such rows are identical. Let's call this `Row Type A`.\n        *   Rows that form the horizontal white bar of the cross. These rows will be all white: `[W, W, ..., W, W, W, ..., W]`. All such rows are identical. Let's call this `Row Type B`.\n    *   **Linear Independence:** We have two distinct types of rows. Are they linearly independent?\n        *   `Row Type A` is not a scalar multiple of `Row Type B` because `A` contains two different values (`R` and `W`) while `B` contains only one (`W`).\n        *   Therefore, the two row types are linearly independent.\n    *   **Rank Calculation:** Since the entire matrix is composed of only these two types of rows, any row in the matrix is either `Type A` or `Type B`. The set of all rows can be spanned by just these two linearly independent row vectors. The maximum number of linearly independent rows is 2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The rank of the matrix representing the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Flags of African Nations to Find Those with Rank 2**\n\nWe need to find African flags whose matrix representation has exactly two linearly independent rows (or columns). We can categorize flags based on their designs to estimate their rank.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** These flags have the simplest designs. The row space is one-dimensional.\n    *   **Design:** Flags consisting purely of horizontal stripes (e.g., Gabon, Sierra Leone, Mauritius) or vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali).\n    *   **Reasoning:** In a horizontal tri-color like Gabon (Green, Yellow, Blue), the rows are `[G,G,...,G]`, `[Y,Y,...,Y]`, and `[B,B,...,B]`. Any of these rows is a scalar multiple of any other (e.g., `Row_Y = (Y/G) * Row_G`). Therefore, they are all linearly dependent, and the rank is 1. A similar logic applies to vertical stripes and their columns.\n\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags:** These flags have complex designs that create three or more linearly independent row/column types.\n    *   **Design:**\n        1.  **Complex geometric patterns:** Diagonal divisions (Tanzania, Namibia, DRC), triangles at the hoist (Djibouti, Sudan, Eritrea), or multiple geometric elements (South Africa, Liberia, Togo).\n        2.  **Complex emblems or symbols:** Coats of arms (Equatorial Guinea), detailed shields (Kenya, Eswatini), complex animals (Uganda's crane, Zambia's eagle), multiple distinct symbols (Angola's machete/cogwheel, Mozambique's book/AK-47), or intricate line-based symbols (Morocco's pentagram).\n    *   **Reasoning:** Each distinct element or complex line in these symbols tends to create a new, unique row vector that is linearly independent from the others, leading to a rank of 3 or higher. For example, in the flag of Uganda, there is a row of black, a row of yellow, and a row of red. Then, a row passing through the central white disk is different, and a row passing through the grey crane on the disk is different again, leading to at least 3 linearly independent row types.\n\n*   **Rank 2 Flags:** These flags must have a structure more complex than simple stripes but simpler than the flags mentioned above. We are looking for designs that generate exactly two linearly independent basis vectors for their row space. Two main patterns fit this criterion:\n\n    1.  **Vertical bar with horizontal stripes:** A vertical bar at the hoist with two or more horizontal stripes on the fly.\n        *   **Flags:** Benin, Madagascar.\n        *   **Reasoning (for Benin - Green/Yellow/Red):** The matrix has two types of rows. Rows in the top half: `[G, G, ..., Y, Y, ...]`. Rows in the bottom half: `[G, G, ..., R, R, ...]`. These two row vectors are linearly independent, and there are no other types of rows. The rank is 2.\n\n    2.  **Simple stripes with a single, simple, centered symbol:** A background of horizontal or vertical stripes with a simple, solid symbol (like a star, disc, or crescent) in the center.\n        *   **Flags:** Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Niger, Senegal, Somalia.\n        *   **Reasoning (for Ghana - Red/Yellow/Green horizontal stripes with a central Black star on the yellow stripe):** The flag has three types of \"plain\" rows: all-Red, all-Yellow, and all-Green. These are all scalar multiples of a vector of all ones, `u_1 = [1, 1, ..., 1]`, so they span a 1D space. Then there are rows that pass through the black star on the yellow stripe. These rows look like `[Y, Y, ..., B, ..., Y, Y]`. This vector is not a multiple of `u_1`. Let's define a second basis vector `u_2` that is zero everywhere except for the columns where the star is (e.g., `u_2 = [0,..,0,1,1,0,..,0]`). Any row in the flag can now be expressed as a linear combination of `u_1` and `u_2`. For example, a star row is `Y*u_1 + (B-Y)*u_2`. Since any row can be constructed from these two linearly independent basis vectors, the rank is 2. This logic applies to all flags in this category.\n\n**Final List of African Flags with Rank 2**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following national flags have the same algebraic rank (2) as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   **Benin** (Vertical bar, horizontal stripes)\n*   **Burkina Faso** (Horizontal stripes, central star)\n*   **Cameroon** (Vertical stripes, central star)\n*   **Ghana** (Horizontal stripes, central star)\n*   **Madagascar** (Vertical bar, horizontal stripes)\n*   **Niger** (Horizontal stripes, central circle)\n*   **Senegal** (Vertical stripes, central star)\n*   **Somalia** (Solid field, central star)\n\n<<<Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Madagascar, Niger, Senegal, Somalia>>>"
