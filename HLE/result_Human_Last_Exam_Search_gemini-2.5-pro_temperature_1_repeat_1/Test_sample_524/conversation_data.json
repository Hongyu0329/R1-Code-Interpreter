    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous planar continuum is a compact, connected, and homogeneous subset of the plane. A space is homogeneous if, for any two points within it, there is a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps one point to the other. The classification of such continua results in four distinct classes:\n\n*   **The single point:** This is the degenerate case of a continuum.\n*   **The circle:** This is the familiar simple closed curve.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a fractal-like, arc-like continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This can be thought of as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle.\n\nA significant result in topology, completed by Hoehn and Oversteegen in 2014, shows that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of these three: the circle, the pseudo-arc, or the circle of pseudo-arcs. Including the degenerate case of a single point gives a total of four homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
