    "A finite group G is called a **filled group** if all its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fill the group. A subset S of a group G is **product-free** if for all a, b, c in S (not necessarily distinct), the relation ab = c does not hold. A product-free set is **maximal by inclusion** if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A set S **fills** G if every non-identity element of G is either in S or can be expressed as a product of two elements of S.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is a result of the properties of both filled groups and nilpotent groups. A key property of a finite nilpotent group is that it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. Furthermore, if a group is filled, then all of its quotient groups must also be filled. Since the Sylow p-subgroups of a nilpotent group are among its quotients, each Sylow p-subgroup of a filled nilpotent group must itself be a filled group.\n\nThe classification of filled p-groups is as follows:\n*   For an odd prime p, a finite p-group is filled if and only if it is the cyclic group of order 3 (C₃) or the cyclic group of order 5 (C₅).\n*   For p=2, a finite abelian 2-group is filled if and only if it is an elementary abelian 2-group (a direct product of cyclic groups of order 2). There also exist non-abelian filled 2-groups, the most notable of which is the dihedral group of order 8 (D₈).\n\nA crucial property is that the direct product of a set of filled groups of pairwise coprime orders is also a filled group. This allows for the construction of all finite filled nilpotent groups from the classified filled p-groups.\n\nTherefore, the finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the groups that are isomorphic to a direct product of the following:\n*   A filled 2-group, which can be an elementary abelian 2-group or the dihedral group of order 8.\n*   A filled 3-group, which must be the cyclic group C₃.\n*   A filled 5-group, which must be the cyclic group C₅.\n\nIn summary, a finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if it is isomorphic to a direct product G₂ × G₃ × G₅, where:\n*   G₂ is a filled 2-group (i.e., an elementary abelian 2-group or D₈).\n*   G₃ is either trivial or the cyclic group of order 3.\n*   G₅ is either trivial or the cyclic group of order 5.\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are the elementary abelian 2-groups, the cyclic groups C3 and C5, the dihedral group of order 8, and all possible direct products of these groups of coprime orders.>>>"
