    "The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car is the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's \"It,\" produced by New Line Cinema, a major film studio.\n\nIn the film, the character of Beverly Marsh (played by Sophia Lillis) is part of a group of outcast teenagers known as the Losers' Club, who are terrorized by the evil entity Pennywise. The members of the Losers' Club frequently use their bicycles as their primary mode of transportation and to escape from bullies. While there are numerous scenes featuring the children on their bikes, a key confrontational scene involves the Losers' Club facing off against the bully Henry Bowers and his gang, who are in a car. Although detailed shot-by-shot descriptions of every bike scene are not available in the search results, the film features prominent bicycle scenes and a clear antagonist in a car, and Beverly Marsh is one of the central teenage characters who rides a bike.\n\nAnother film considered was the 1995 coming-of-age movie \"Now and Then,\" also a New Line Cinema production, which heavily features four young female friends and their bicycles. The girls have several memorable adventures on their bikes, including being chased by a group of boys. However, there is no specific evidence from the search results detailing a scene where one of the girls on a pink bike rides directly toward a car.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
