**1. Amlodipine**
*   **Drug Class:** Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB)
*   **Rationale:** CCBs are a first-line treatment for hypertension and are particularly effective in African American patients. Since MM is unable to take verapamil (a non-dihydropyridine CCB), a dihydropyridine like amlodipine is an excellent alternative. It is a potent vasodilator that will help lower her blood pressure.

**2. Losartan**
*   **Drug Class:** Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB)
*   **Rationale:** For patients with hypertension and compelling comorbidities such as diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended for renal protection. Given MM's A1C of 6.7%, she has diabetes, making an ARB a crucial part of her regimen. ARBs are often chosen over ACE inhibitors in African American patients to avoid the higher risk of cough and angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors.

**3. Spironolactone**
*   **Drug Class:** Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist (MRA) / Potassium-Sparing Diuretic
*   **Rationale:** MM's blood pressure is not controlled on three agents, classifying it as resistant hypertension. Guidelines strongly recommend the addition of spironolactone as a fourth-line agent in these cases. It is often very effective for resistant hypertension, which may be driven by excess aldosterone. Studies have shown that adding low-dose spironolactone to an existing regimen, including an ARB like losartan, leads to significant blood pressure reduction. While other diuretics are on MM's exclusion list, spironolactone is not and is the most appropriate next step. When combining an ARB like losartan with spironolactone, it is important to monitor serum potassium levels, as both can cause an increase.
