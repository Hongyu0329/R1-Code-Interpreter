    "In the European Tango, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the fundamental technique of the dance.\n\nThe core difference lies in the Tango's unique technique compared to the four other \"swing\" dances listed (Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep). These swing dances are characterized by continuous, flowing movements, rise and fall, and body sway. This creates a momentum that can be used to either under- or overturn figures as a variation or to navigate the dance floor. For example, in the Viennese Waltz and English Waltz, overturning a reverse turn is a common technique used to travel down the long side of the floor or adjust alignment.\n\nThe Tango, however, is technically distinct. It is a \"staccato\" dance with no rise and fall, no body swing, and no sway. The movement is sharp, grounded, and flat-footed. Turns are executed with a clipped, precise action, often described as a swivel, rather than a continuous, momentum-driven swing. To overturn a reverse turn in Tango, a dancer would need to introduce swing, momentum, and possibly rise and fall, all of which are violations of the dance's core technical principles. Doing so would make the figure cease to be recognizable as Tango.\n\nWhile there are advanced Tango figures with names like \"Overturned Five Step\" or \"Overturned Twist Turn,\" these are specifically choreographed figures with a set amount of turn and do not imply that a standard reverse turn can be arbitrarily overturned in the way it can in swing dances.\n\n<<<C>>>"
