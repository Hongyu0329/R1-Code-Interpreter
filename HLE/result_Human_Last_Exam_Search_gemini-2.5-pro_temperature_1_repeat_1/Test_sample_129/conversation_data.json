    "An exhaustive search of all possible valid boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols is required. The symbols are T, F, !, &, |, (, ). The expressions must evaluate to True.\n\nLet's categorize the expressions by their top-level structure.\n\n### 1. Expressions with a binary operator as the last operation\nThese are of the form `A op B`, where `op` is either `&` or `|`. Due to operator precedence (`&` > `|`), an expression like `A|B&C` is parsed as `A|(B&C)`.\n\n-   **Forms like `L op L op L` (3 literals, 2 operators, 5 symbols total):**\n    *   `L1 | L2 | L3`: True if at least one literal is `T`. Out of 2Â³ = 8 combinations, only `F|F|F` is false. This gives **7** true expressions.\n    *   `L1 & L2 & L3`: True only if all literals are `T`. This gives **1** true expression (`T&T&T`).\n    *   `(L1 & L2) | L3`: True if `L3` is `T` (4 combinations for `L1,L2`), or if `L1&L2` is `T` and `L3` is `F` (`T&T|F`). This gives **5** true expressions.\n    *   `L1 | (L2 & L3)`: True if `L1` is `T` (4 combinations for `L2,L3`), or if `L1` is `F` and `L2&L3` is `T` (`F|T&T`). This gives **5** true expressions.\n    *   Subtotal: 7 + 1 + 5 + 5 = **18** expressions.\n\n-   **Forms involving `!`:**\n    *   `!L1 op !L2`:\n        *   `!L & !L`: `!F & !F` is true. (1 expression)\n        *   `!L | !L`: True unless both are `!T`. `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` are true. (3 expressions)\n    *   `!!L1 op L2` and `L1 op !!L2`:\n        *   `&`: `!!T & T` and `T & !!T`. (2 expressions)\n        *   `|`: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T` (3 expressions). `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T` (3 expressions). Total of 6.\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 3 + 2 + 6 = **12** expressions.\n\n-   **Forms involving parentheses `()`:**\n    *   `(L1) op L2` and `L1 op (L2)`:\n        *   `&`: `(T)&T` and `T&(T)`. (2 expressions)\n        *   `|`: `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T` (3 expressions). `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)` (3 expressions). Total of 6.\n    *   `(!L1) op L2` and `L1 op (!L2)`:\n        *   `&`: `(!F)&T` and `T&(!F)`. (2 expressions)\n        *   `|`: `(!F)|T`, `(!F)|F`, `(!T)|T` (3 expressions). `T|(!F)`, `T|(!T)`, `F|(!F)` (3 expressions). Total of 6.\n    *   Subtotal: 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 = **16** expressions.\n\nTotal for binary operators at the top level: 18 + 12 + 16 = **46**.\n\n### 2. Expressions with `!` as the top-level operator\nThese are of the form `!(A)`, where `A` is an expression of length 4 which must evaluate to `False`.\n\n-   `!(L1 op L2)`:\n    *   `L&L` is false for `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`. So `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)` are true. (3 expressions)\n    *   `L|L` is false only for `F|F`. So `!(F|F)` is true. (1 expression)\n-   Subtotal: 3 + 1 = **4** expressions.\n\n### 3. Expressions with `()` as the top-level operator\nThese are of the form `(A)`, where `A` is an expression of length 3 which must evaluate to `True`.\n\n-   `(L1 op L2)`:\n    *   `(T&T)` is true. (1 expression)\n    *   `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are true. (3 expressions)\n-   `(!!L)`: `(!!T)` is true. (1 expression)\n-   `(!L)`: `(!F)` is true. (1 expression)\n-   Subtotal: 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = **6** expressions.\n\n### 4. Purely Unary and Parenthetical Expressions\nThese are sequences of `!`, `(`, `)` and a single literal.\n\n1.  `!!!!T`: This is parsed as `!(!(!(!T)))` which is True. (1 expression)\n2.  `!!(T)`: This is `!(!((T)))` which is True. Length is `2 + 3 = 5`. (1 expression)\n3.  `!!(!(F))`: This is `!(!((!(F))))` which is True. Length is `2 + 3 = 5`. (1 expression)\n4.  `!(!(T))`: This is `!(!((T)))`, which is `!(F)` or True. Length `1 + 4 = 5`. (1 expression)\n5.  `!((F))`: This is `!(F)`, which is True. Length `1 + 4 = 5`. (1 expression)\n6.  `(!!T)`: This is `(!!(T))`, which is True. Length `1 + 3 + 1 = 5`. (1 expression)\n7.  `(!(!T))`: This is `(!(!(T)))`, which is `(T)` or True. Length `1 + 3 + 1 = 5`. (1 expression)\n8.  `((!F))`: This is `((!(F)))`, which is `(T)` or True. Length `2 + 2 + 1 = 5`. (1 expression)\n9.  `(((T)))`: True. Length `3 + 1 + 1 = 5`. (1 expression)\n\nSubtotal: **9** expressions.\n\n### Final Calculation\nSumming up all the non-overlapping categories:\n-   Binary top-level: 46\n-   `!(L op L)` forms: 4\n-   `(L op L)` and other length 3 `(A)` forms: 6\n-   Purely unary/parenthetical: 9\n\nTotal = 46 + 4 + 6 + 9 = **65**.\n\nLet's do a quick sanity check, as these problems can be tricky.\n- `L op (L)` and `L op L` are distinct by length. Correct.\n- `!!T` (len 3) vs `(!!T)` (len 5) vs `!!(T)` (len 5). The two length-5 expressions `(!!T)` and `!!(T)` are distinct strings and both are counted. Correct.\nThe categorization seems robust.\n\nFinal count is 65.\n<<<65>>>"
