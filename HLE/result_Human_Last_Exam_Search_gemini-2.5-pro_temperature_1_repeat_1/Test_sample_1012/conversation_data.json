    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer poses a significant threat to symmetric key encryption, but this threat can be countered by increasing the key length. The most effective quantum attack against symmetric keys is Grover's algorithm, which can search an unsorted database, such as a key space, with a quadratic speedup compared to classical computers.\n\nThis quadratic speedup effectively halves the security, in bits, of a symmetric key. For instance, a 128-bit AES key, which would require a classical computer approximately 2¹²⁸ operations to break, could be broken by a quantum computer in roughly 2⁶⁴ operations. A security level of 64 bits is not considered secure against a determined adversary.\n\nTo maintain a sufficient level of security against a quantum attack, the key size must be doubled. Cryptographic experts and organizations like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) recommend a minimum of 128 bits of security for the foreseeable future. To achieve this 128-bit security level in a post-quantum world, a symmetric key of at least 256 bits is required. An attack on a 256-bit key would be reduced to an effective strength of 128 bits by Grover's algorithm, which is considered a secure level.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that a symmetric key cannot be cracked by an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, it needs to be at least 256 bits long.\n\n<<<A>>>"
