    "Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian, used the phrase \"stagnant swamp\" to describe traditional gender roles and the immense difficulty in changing the prevailing views on the position of women in society.\n\nThis characterization emerged from his experiences with the deeply entrenched societal norms and the resistance to progress in women's rights, a topic of considerable debate during his time. An account from the book *Russian Culture in War and Revolution, 1914-22* places this quote in the context of powerful stereotypes based on gender differences and the obstacles women faced.\n\nFurther evidence of Milyukov's engagement with this issue is a noted stormy debate at the founding congress of the Constitutional Democratic Party. In this debate, he opposed his wife, Anna Miliukova, on the inclusion of women's suffrage in the party's platform. Although he later changed his stance and came to support women's suffrage, his earlier opposition and his \"stagnant swamp\" remark highlight his perception of the deep-seated societal inertia on the matter of gender equality.\n\n<<<traditional gender roles>>>"
