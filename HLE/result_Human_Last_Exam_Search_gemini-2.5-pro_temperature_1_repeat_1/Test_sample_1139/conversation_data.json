    "In the study of disordered electronic systems, the supersymmetric sigma-model is a powerful theoretical framework. For systems belonging to the symmetry class D, the properties of the model are described by fields that take values in a specific mathematical space, known as the target manifold. When considering two replicas (`n=2`) to analyze higher moments of physical observables, this target manifold is given by the quotient of two supergroups.\n\nThe target manifold for the supersymmetric sigma-model of class D with `n` replicas is `OSp(2n|2n)/U(n|n)`. The non-Grassman variables, which are the standard commuting numbers in contrast to the anticommuting Grassman variables, parametrize the bosonic sector of this space. The bosonic sector is the quotient of the maximal bosonic subgroups of the respective supergroups.\n\nFor the supergroup `G = OSp(2n|2n)`, its maximal bosonic subgroup `G_b` is `O(2n) x Sp(2n,R)`. For `H = U(n|n)`, the maximal bosonic subgroup `H_b` is `U(n) x U(n)`. The number of non-Grassman variables is therefore the dimension of the bosonic manifold `G_b/H_b`, which is calculated as the difference of the dimensions of the respective bosonic subgroups.\n\nFor the specific case of two replicas (`n=2`), we have:\n*   `G_b = O(4) x Sp(4,R)`\n*   `H_b = U(2) x U(2)`\n\nThe dimensions of these classical Lie groups are given by standard formulas:\n*   The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(N)` is `N(N-1)/2`. Thus, `dim(O(4)) = 4(3)/2 = 6`.\n*   The dimension of the real symplectic group `Sp(2N,R)` is `N(2N+1)`. For `N=2`, `dim(Sp(4,R)) = 2(2*2+1) = 10`.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group `U(N)` is `N^2`. Therefore, `dim(U(2)) = 2^2 = 4`.\n\nUsing these values, we can find the dimension of the bosonic sector:\n*   `dim(G_b) = dim(O(4)) + dim(Sp(4,R)) = 6 + 10 = 16`.\n*   `dim(H_b) = dim(U(2)) + dim(U(2)) = 4 + 4 = 8`.\n\nThe number of non-Grassman variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector is the dimension of the quotient space `G_b/H_b`, which is `dim(G_b) - dim(H_b) = 16 - 8 = 8`.\n\n<<<8>>>"
