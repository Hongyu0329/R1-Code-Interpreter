    "The number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions is denoted by \\(av_n^k(1324)\\). The specific quantity requested is \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\nRecent research in combinatorics has focused on determining these numbers. A key finding is that for a fixed number of inversions \\(k\\), the value of \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) becomes constant for all sufficiently large \\(n\\). Specifically, a 2024 paper by Svante Linusson and Emil Verkama, titled \"Enumerating 1324-avoiders with few inversions,\" establishes that \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) is constant for all \\(n \\ge (k+7)/2\\).\n\nFor the case of \\(k=3\\), this condition becomes \\(n \\ge (3+7)/2 = 5\\). Since the given length is \\(n=333\\), which is much larger than 5, the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is given by this constant value.\n\nThe aforementioned paper provides a table with the determined values for small \\(k\\). For \\(k=3\\), the value is 14.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions is 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
