    "A Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is the date and time after which a compounded sterile preparation should not be stored or used. For a single-dose ampule that has been opened (punctured), the guidelines are strict.\n\nAccording to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and other regulatory bodies, a single-dose ampule is intended for immediate use only. Once opened, it cannot be stored for any period of time. This is because an ampule is a glass container that is broken to be opened and cannot be resealed, which increases the risk of contamination.\n\nIn contrast, single-dose *vials* that have been punctured within a sterile environment, such as an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, may have a longer BUD. For instance, if a single-dose vial is entered in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, it may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, provided storage requirements are met. If punctured in an environment with air quality worse than ISO Class 5, the BUD for a single-dose vial is one hour.\n\nHowever, for a single-dose **ampule**, the guidance is unequivocal: it must be used immediately upon opening and any remaining contents must be discarded.\n\n<<<Immediate use only, no storage permitted.>>>"
