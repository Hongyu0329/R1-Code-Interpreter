    "Let $K$ be the splitting field of the polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A normal field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a field extension where $L$ is the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degrees of such extensions $L$ that are proper subfields of $K$ ($\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$) are determined by the structure of the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe determination of these degrees follows a sequence of steps derived from Galois theory:\n\n1.  **Factoring the Polynomial**: The given polynomial $P(x)$ can be factored by grouping terms.\n    $P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Galois Groups of the Factors**:\n    *   Let $f(x) = x^2 - 2$. Its splitting field is $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n    *   Let $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. A calculus-based analysis of its derivative, $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$, reveals that $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots. A key theorem in Galois theory states that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree with exactly two non-real roots has the symmetric group $S_p$ as its Galois group. Therefore, the Galois group of $g(x)$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\n3.  **Determining the Galois Group of the Full Polynomial**:\n    The splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields $K_f$ and $K_g$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups if the intersection of the splitting fields is just $\\mathbb{Q}$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_g$ (an $S_5$ extension) is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$. The discriminant of $x^5+ax+b$ is $4^4 a^5 + 5^5 b^4$, which for $g(x)$ is a large negative number, so $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$ is an imaginary quadratic field. Since $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field, the intersection $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Thus, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The order of this group is $|G| = 2 \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n4.  **Finding Degrees of Normal Sub-extensions**:\n    According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $L \\subset K$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G$. The degree of such an extension is the index of the subgroup, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G:H|$. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ implies that $H$ must be a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$.\n\n    The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are the trivial group $\\{e\\}$, the alternating group $A_5$, and $S_5$ itself. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$. This allows for the enumeration of all normal subgroups of their direct product $G = C_2 \\times S_5$. The proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$ are:\n    *   $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, with order $|H_1|=2$.\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$, with order $|H_2|=60$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$, with order $|H_3|=120$.\n    *   $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$, with order $|H_4|=120$.\n    *   $H_5$, a \"diagonal\" subgroup of order 120, corresponding to the sign homomorphism from $S_5$ to $C_2$.\n\n    Calculating the indices of these subgroups gives the possible degrees for the normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$:\n    *   $[G:H_1] = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n    *   $[G:H_2] = 240 / 60 = 4$.\n    *   $[G:H_3] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n    *   $[G:H_4] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n    *   $[G:H_5] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n\nThe set of distinct possible degrees for such extensions $L$ is therefore $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n<<<The possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.>>>"
