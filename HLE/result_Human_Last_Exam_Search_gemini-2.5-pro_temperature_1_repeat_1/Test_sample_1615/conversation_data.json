    "This is a problem concerning the chromatic number of a graph. Let's denote the number of vertices by $n = 12345$.\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. A graph is called \"properly colored\" if it satisfies this condition.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, with the condition that $G$ is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n\n1.  **Chromatic Number of a Complete Graph**: A complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. To color $K_n$ properly, every vertex must receive a unique color. Therefore, the chromatic number of a complete graph is equal to its number of vertices: $\\chi(K_n) = n$. For our case, $\\chi(K_{12345}) = 12345$.\n\n2.  **The Constraint**: The problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is *not* the complete graph. This means that there is at least one pair of vertices in $G$ that is not connected by an edge.\n\n3.  **Finding the Maximum Chromatic Number**: We want to find the maximum value of $\\chi(G)$ for any graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not complete.\n    Let $G$ be such a graph. Since $G$ is not complete, there must be at least one edge missing. Let's consider the graph $G' = K_{12345} - e$, which is a complete graph with a single edge $e$ removed. Any non-complete graph with 12345 vertices is a subgraph of $K_{12345} - e$ for some edge $e$. Since the chromatic number of a subgraph cannot be greater than the chromatic number of the graph itself, the maximum chromatic number will be achieved by such a graph $G'$.\n\n4.  **Coloring $K_n - e$**: Let's determine the chromatic number of $G' = K_n - e$. Let the missing edge be between vertices $u$ and $v$.\n    *   Because the edge $(u, v)$ does not exist, $u$ and $v$ can be assigned the same color.\n    *   Let's try to color $G'$ with $n-1$ colors. We can assign the same color, say color 1, to both $u$ and $v$.\n    *   Every other vertex in the graph is adjacent to all other vertices, including $u$ and $v$. The subgraph induced by the remaining $n-2$ vertices is a complete graph $K_{n-2}$, which requires $n-2$ distinct colors. None of these can be color 1, as they are all adjacent to both $u$ and $v$.\n    *   So, we can color $u$ and $v$ with color 1, and the remaining $n-2$ vertices with $n-2$ new distinct colors (from color 2 to color $n-1$). This results in a proper coloring using a total of $n-1$ colors. Thus, $\\chi(K_n - e) \\le n-1$.\n    *   To show that we need at least $n-1$ colors, consider the subgraph formed by the vertex $u$ and the $n-2$ vertices other than $v$. These $n-1$ vertices are all mutually adjacent, forming a clique of size $n-1$ ($K_{n-1}$). A clique of size $k$ always requires $k$ colors. Therefore, $\\chi(K_n - e) \\ge n-1$.\n    *   Combining these two points, we have $\\chi(K_n - e) = n-1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: For $n = 12345$, the maximum number of colors needed for a proper coloring of a non-complete graph is $12345 - 1 = 12344$. This maximum is achieved by a graph that is a complete graph with one edge removed ($K_{12345} - e$).\n\nThe mention of the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ points towards Brooks' Theorem, which states that for any connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G)$. In our case, for $G = K_{12345} - e$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G) = 12344$, and we found that $\\chi(G) = 12344$. This is consistent with Brooks' Theorem.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
