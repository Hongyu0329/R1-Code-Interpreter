    "The chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B.\n\nRhodamine B is a synthetic dye characterized by its vibrant, fluorescent pink or red color. It is also referred to as Basic Violet 10, and when mixed with other pigments, it is used to create the bright pink watercolor known as Opera Rose. While its powdered form can appear as green or reddish-violet crystals, it produces a bright pink hue when used as a dye.\n\nCrayola does not publicly disclose the specific pigment composition of their crayons for proprietary reasons. However, Rhodamine B is listed by chemical suppliers as a dye used in the manufacturing of crayons.\n\nGiven the distinctly vibrant and fluorescent pink color of Rhodamine B, it is most likely used in Crayola crayons with similar properties. This would include colors from the neon or fluorescent lines. Therefore, the crayon containing this chemical would be a bright, fluorescent pink such as **Razzle Dazzle Rose**, **Shocking Pink**, or a similarly vivid shade.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose or a similar fluorescent pink crayon>>>"
