    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule where a tense (long) vowel in a stressed syllable becomes lax (short) when it is followed by at least two other syllables. Based on this principle, an analysis of the provided words reveals the following:\n\n*   **Derivative**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /aɪ/ in the root word `derive` is laxed to /ɪ/ in `derivative` (`de-RIV-a-tive`), where the vowel is in the third-to-last syllable.\n*   **Serenity**: This is a classic example of the rule. The tense vowel /iː/ in `serene` is laxed to /ɛ/ in `serenity` (`se-REN-i-ty`), where it falls on the antepenultimate (third-to-last) syllable.\n*   **Gratitude**: This word also underwent trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in the related word `grateful` becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in `gratitude` (`GRAT-i-tude`), where the stress is on the first of three syllables.\n*   **Southern**: The tense diphthong /aʊ/ in `south` changes to the lax vowel /ʌ/ in `southern`. However, \"southern\" is a disyllabic (two-syllable) word. While this is a form of vowel laxing, it does not fit the definition of *trisyllabic* laxing, which requires the word to have at least three syllables.\n*   **Pleasant**: The tense vowel /iː/ in `please` is laxed to /ɛ/ in `pleasant`. Similar to \"southern,\" \"pleasant\" is a disyllabic word and therefore has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n*   **Shadow**: This word comes from the Old English *sceaduwe*, an oblique case of *sceadu*. The vowel in the Old English root *sceadu* was already short (`æ`). Since the vowel was never long to begin with, it could not have been shortened or \"laxed.\" Therefore, it has not undergone any form of vowel laxing.\n\nWhile `southern` and `pleasant` underwent a type of vowel shortening, it was not trisyllabic laxing due to their syllable count. In contrast, `shadow` never underwent vowel shortening at all because its root vowel was always short.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
