    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger topological system. The Chern number, being a topological invariant, is an additive quantity. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual insulators.\n\nThe additivity of the Chern number is a fundamental property. It can be understood by considering that the Chern number characterizes the number of chiral edge states at the boundary of the material, a principle known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. When two such insulators are joined, their edge states combine. For a negligible tunneling barrier, the two systems are strongly coupled, and the resulting system behaves as a single Chern insulator.\n\nResearch has shown that the Chern number can be decomposed into a sum of component-specific winding numbers. Furthermore, for a system composed of multiple bands, the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual bands. This principle of additivity extends to the junction of two distinct topological insulators. For instance, at the interface between two materials with different Chern numbers, the number of chiral edge states is equal to the difference between their Chern numbers.\n\nIn the scenario described, where two insulators with the same Chern number (C=1) are joined, they form a cohesive system. The total Chern number of this junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
