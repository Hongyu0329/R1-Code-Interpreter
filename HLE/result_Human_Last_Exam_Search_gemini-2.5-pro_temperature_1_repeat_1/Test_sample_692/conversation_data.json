    "### The Earliest Recorded Date in the Americas: A Tale of Two Calendars\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas is found on a cylinder seal from the Olmec site of San Andrés in Tabasco, Mexico. Dated to approximately 650 BCE, the seal bears glyphs that have been interpreted as the day \"3 Ajaw\" from the 260-day calendar, a calendrical system common throughout ancient Mesoamerica.\n\nThis discovery points to the Olmec civilization as being among the first in the Americas to develop a system of writing that included calendrical notations. The \"3 Ajaw\" inscription, while representing a specific day, is part of a recurring 260-day cycle and does not pinpoint a unique year. These early calendrical records were often associated with sacred rituals and the legitimization of rulers.\n\nAnother significant early recorded date comes from Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. This monument, which depicts a sacrificed captive, includes a glyph between the figure's feet that is interpreted as the calendrical name \"1 Earthquake.\" While initially dated to between 600 and 500 BCE, the precise dating of this monument has been subject to scholarly debate.\n\nFor a more precise and linear form of dating, the earliest known use of the Long Count calendar is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. This monument is inscribed with the date December 36 BCE (or 7.16.3.2.13 in the Long Count system). The Long Count calendar allowed for the recording of specific dates over long periods, starting from a mythological creation date. The development of this complex system is now often attributed to the Mixe-Zoque peoples, who had strong ties to the Olmecs.\n\nTherefore, while the San Andrés cylinder seal holds the distinction for the earliest known recorded calendrical day name, the Chiapa de Corzo stela provides the earliest known specific date within a linear calendrical system.\n\n<<<The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is found on a cylinder seal from San Andrés, Tabasco, Mexico, dated to approximately 650 BCE, which contains the day name \"3 Ajaw\". The earliest known specific, non-repeating date is 36 BCE, found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico, recorded in the Long Count calendar.>>>"
