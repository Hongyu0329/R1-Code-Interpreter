    "An American in Paris, the 1951 recipient of the Academy Award for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor and feature a depiction of a Luxor Obelisk.\n\nThe film, set in the French capital, includes a scene on a set designed to represent the Place de la Concorde, where one of the two ancient Egyptian obelisks is located. Furthermore, a prop oil painting used in the movie explicitly depicts the Luxor Obelisk. The notable ballet sequence in the film is also set around a replica of a fountain from the Place de la Concorde.\n\nWhile earlier Best Picture winners, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), were also set in Paris, there is no definitive evidence from available information that they contained scenes featuring the iconic monument. Similarly, *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), another Best Picture winner with a global setting that includes Paris, does not have confirmed scenes at the Place de la Concorde in the available location breakdowns.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
