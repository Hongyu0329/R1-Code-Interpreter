The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles varies depending on the reaction. For water splitting, ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 (Ni:Ce) have shown high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, while a 1:2 ratio has been found to be optimal for the hydrogen evolution reaction. For the Water Gas Shift reaction, an optimal range is generally observed at lower nickel concentrations, typically between 5 and 12.5 weight percent Ni, with some studies pointing to an optimum around 7% molar, especially when nickel is atomically dispersed to prevent side reactions.
