    "**The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 86.**\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula, which expresses the solution Z for the equation e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup> in terms of a series of nested commutators of X and Y, involves an increasing number of terms at each order. The number of these terms corresponds to the dimension of the free Lie algebra generated by X and Y at a given degree.\n\nFor order 10, there are 86 linearly independent commutators, which means there are 86 nonzero coefficients in the expansion when expressed in a standard basis like the Hall basis. Research by Casas and Murua in 2020 provides a table detailing the number of terms at each order, confirming the value of 86 for order 10. It is worth noting that while other more compact representations exist, the number of independent commutators in the Hall basis is a standard measure.\n\nEarly computational efforts by Richtmyer and Greenspan carried the expansion out to the tenth order, but they only reported a few terms as not all are linearly independent due to the Jacobi identity. More recent algorithms can compute the BCH series to much higher degrees, confirming the number of non-vanishing coefficients.\n\n<<<86>>>"
