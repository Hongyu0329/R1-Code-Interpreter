    "The VC dimension of a hypothesis class is the size of the largest set of points that the class can shatter. A set of points is \"shattered\" if for every possible binary labeling of those points, there is a hypothesis in the class that can produce that labeling. In this case, the hypothesis class is $H_{z-ones}$, which consists of all functions that map a domain $X$ of size $T$ to $\\{0, 1\\}$ and assign exactly $z$ ones.\n\nLet's determine the largest set of points, $S \\subseteq X$, of size $m$ that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nFor the class $H_{z-ones}$ to shatter a set $S$ of size $m$, it must be able to realize any labeling of the points in $S$. Let's consider an arbitrary labeling on $S$, which has $k$ points labeled as 1 and $m-k$ points labeled as 0, where $0 \\le k \\le m$.\n\nA hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that generates this labeling must assign exactly $k$ ones to the points within $S$. The defining constraint of the class is that any hypothesis must assign a total of exactly $z$ ones over the entire domain $X$. Therefore, the remaining $z-k$ ones must be assigned to the points outside of $S$, i.e., in the set $X \\setminus S$.\n\nFor this to be possible for any labeling of $S$, two conditions must be met for all possible values of $k$ (from $0$ to $m$):\n1.  The number of ones assigned outside of $S$, which is $z-k$, must be non-negative. This implies $z-k \\ge 0$, or $k \\le z$. This must hold for all $k$ up to $m$, so the most restrictive case is when $k=m$. This gives us the condition $m \\le z$.\n2.  It must be possible to assign $z-k$ ones to the points in $X \\setminus S$. The number of points available in $X \\setminus S$ is $T-m$. Therefore, the number of required ones, $z-k$, cannot exceed the number of available points. This means $z-k \\le T-m$. This inequality must hold for all $k$ from $0$ to $m$. The left side of the inequality is largest when $k$ is smallest (i.e., $k=0$). This gives the most restrictive condition: $z \\le T-m$, which can be rewritten as $m \\le T-z$.\n\nFor a set of size $m$ to be shattered, both conditions must hold. Thus, $m$ must satisfy both $m \\le z$ and $m \\le T-z$. The VC dimension is the largest integer $m$ that satisfies both of these inequalities.\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension is the largest $m$ such that $m \\le \\min(z, T-z)$. This means the VC dimension is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nWe can verify this:\n*   **Shattering:** Any set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. As shown above, if $m \\le z$ and $m \\le T-z$, then for any labeling with $k$ ones on the set, we can assign the remaining $z-k$ ones to the $T-m$ points outside the set.\n*   **No larger set can be shattered:** Consider a set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z) + 1$.\n    *   If $z \\le T-z$, then $\\min(z, T-z)=z$. Let's try to shatter a set of size $m = z+1$. The labeling that assigns 1 to all these $z+1$ points cannot be generated, as any hypothesis in the class can only have a total of $z$ ones.\n    *   If $z > T-z$, then $\\min(z, T-z) = T-z$. Let's try to shatter a set of size $m = T-z+1$. Consider the labeling that assigns 0 to all these $m$ points. This would require assigning $z-0 = z$ ones to the points in $X \\setminus S$. However, the number of points in $X \\setminus S$ is $T-m = T - (T-z+1) = z-1$. It is impossible to assign $z$ ones to $z-1$ points.\n\nThus, no set of size greater than $\\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\n\n<<<$\\min(z, T-z)$>>>"
