The maximum distance $l_{\text{max}}$ is given by the formula:
$l_{\text{max}} = \frac{\left(F l_0 + \frac{GMm}{l_0} - \frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2\right) + \sqrt{\left(F l_0 + \frac{GMm}{l_0} - \frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2\right)^2 - 4FGMm}}{2F}$
where:
*   $M$ is the mass of the spaceship,
*   $m$ is the mass of the asteroid,
*   $l_0$ is the initial distance,
*   $v_0$ is the initial speed of the spaceship,
*   $F$ is the additional constant force applied to the spaceship,
*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.
