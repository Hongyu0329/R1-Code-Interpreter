    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Action of Agagia**, which took place on **February 26, 1916**. This event is portrayed in her painting titled *\"The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia, 26 February 1916\"*.\n\nLady Elizabeth Butler was renowned for her military scenes, and she continued to paint significant events throughout World War I. Among her works from this period are depictions of the Battle of Mons in 1914 and the Battle of Loos in 1915. However, the charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia in Egypt during the Senussi Campaign represents the latest specific historical battle identified in her paintings. The painting was commissioned in late 1916 to commemorate the Dorset Yeomanry's service in the First World War.\n\n<<<The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia, 26 February 1916>>>"
