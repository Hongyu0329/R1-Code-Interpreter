    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four main colors: white, red, black, and violet.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a waxy solid that can appear white, colorless, or even pale yellow as it ages or contains impurities. For this reason, it is sometimes also referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus has a dark red color and can possess an iron-grey luster. It is more stable than white phosphorus and is commonly used on the striking surface of safety matchboxes.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable form and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite, with a metallic sheen. It exists in two forms, α-black and β-black.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a crystalline form that is described as being red or purple.\n\nWhile other allotropes like blue phosphorus have been subjects of research, the four distinctly colored and commonly recognized allotropes are white, red, black, and violet.\n\n<<<4>>>"
