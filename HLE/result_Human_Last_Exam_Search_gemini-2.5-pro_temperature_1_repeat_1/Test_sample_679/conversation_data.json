    "To determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon with the molecular formula C7H14, we will analyze the provided 13C NMR data step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Determine the Degree of Unsaturation:** The molecular formula C7H14 fits the general formula for alkenes, CnH2n. This corresponds to one degree of unsaturation, which indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data:** The chemical shifts and multiplicities (s=singlet, t=triplet, d=doublet, q=quartet) provide information about the type of each carbon atom.\n    *   **145(s):** A singlet indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). The shift at 145 ppm is in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm), which points to a carbon in a C=C double bond.\n    *   **112(t):** A triplet indicates a CH2 group. The shift at 112 ppm is also characteristic of an alkene carbon, specifically a terminal =CH2 group.\n    *   **48(t):** A triplet signifies a CH2 group in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **27(d):** A doublet signifies a CH group in the aliphatic region.\n    *   **22(q) and 21(q):** Both are quartets, indicating two different CH3 groups in the aliphatic region.\n\n3.  **Account for All Atoms:** The molecular formula is C7H14. The provided NMR data shows 6 distinct signals. The hint suggests that there may be signal overlapping, which means two carbons are chemically equivalent. Let's count the atoms based on the multiplicities:\n    *   Carbons: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 1(q) + 1(q) = 6 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens: 0(s) + 2(t) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 3(q) + 3(q) = 11 hydrogens.\n    We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (14 - 11 = 3). This confirms that the overlapping signal must correspond to a CH3 group. Therefore, the molecule contains a total of three methyl groups, two of which are chemically equivalent.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments:**\n    *   The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly suggest a `>C=CH2` fragment.\n    *   The molecule must contain an isopropyl group, `–CH(CH3)2`, to account for the CH group and the two equivalent CH3 groups.\n    *   The remaining fragments are an aliphatic `–CH2–` group (from 48(t)) and the third, non-equivalent `–CH3` group (from 21(q) or 22(q)). These combine to form an ethyl group, `–CH2CH3`.\n\n5.  **Construct the Molecule and Determine the IUPAC Name:** The only way to assemble the `>C=CH2` fragment, an isopropyl group, and an ethyl group into a single C7H14 molecule is to attach both the ethyl and isopropyl groups to the quaternary carbon of the alkene.\n\n    The resulting structure is:\n    ```\n          CH(CH3)2\n         /\n    CH2=C\n         \\\n          CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n    To determine the IUPAC name, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    *   Choosing the path through the ethyl group gives a 4-carbon chain (1-butene) with an isopropyl substituent at position 2. This would be named 2-isopropyl-1-butene.\n    *   Choosing the path through the isopropyl group also gives a 4-carbon chain (1-butene). The substituents would be an ethyl group at position 2 and a methyl group at position 3. This would be named 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, when two chains have the same maximum length, the chain with the greater number of substituents is chosen as the main chain. The second option has two substituents (ethyl and methyl), while the first has only one (isopropyl). Therefore, the correct parent chain is the one that leads to the name **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
