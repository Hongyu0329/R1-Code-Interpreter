Let \(f_m\) be the number of sets \(T\) that satisfy the given conditions. The value of \(f_m\) can be determined by the recurrence relation:
$$ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2} \right) $$
This relation holds for \( m \ge 1 \). To compute \( f_m \) for positive integers \( m \), we define the base cases \( f_0 = 1 \) and \( f_k = 0 \) for \( k < 0 \). Using the given hint, where \( a = \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} \), the recursive function is written as:
$$ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( a - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2} \right) $$
