It is not possible to definitively stabilize a localized soliton in a 3D Hamiltonian with only Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, as other energy terms like magnetic anisotropy or an external magnetic field are generally required to create a stable ground state for the soliton to exist within.
