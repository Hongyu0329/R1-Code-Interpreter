    "To date, there have been 10 mature members of the let-7 family identified in humans. These members are designated as let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202.\n\nThese 10 mature microRNAs are derived from 13 precursor genes located at different positions in the human genome. The let-7 family is one of the most conserved and largest families of microRNAs, playing a crucial role in developmental timing and tumor suppression. While most sources confirm the number of mature members as 10, some studies might refer to 9 or 12 members depending on the specific context and classification criteria. For instance, miR-98 is a recognized member of the let-7 family. The members of the let-7 family share a common seed sequence, which is critical for recognizing their target messenger RNAs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
