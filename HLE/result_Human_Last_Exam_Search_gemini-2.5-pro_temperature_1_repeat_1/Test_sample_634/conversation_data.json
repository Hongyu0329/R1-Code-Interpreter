    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves forming a composite matrix and using elementary row operations to reduce it.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s² + s, -s; -s² - 1, s²]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 1: Form the composite matrix P(s) by stacking P1 and P2.**\n\nP(s) =\n[  s² + s,  -s   ]  (Row 1)\n[ -s² - 1,   s²  ]  (Row 2)\n[     s    ,    0   ]  (Row 3)\n[   -s - 1,    1   ]  (Row 4)\n\n**Step 2: Apply elementary row operations to reduce P(s) to a row-echelon form.**\nThe goal is to find a unimodular matrix U(s) such that U(s)P(s) results in a matrix where the GCRD is made explicit. The non-zero rows of the resulting row-reduced matrix will form the GCRD.\n\n1.  Use Row 4 to eliminate the entries in the second column of the other rows.\n    *   Replace Row 1 with (Row 1 + s * Row 4):\n        *   (s² + s) + s(-s - 1) = s² + s - s² - s = 0\n        *   -s + s(1) = 0\n        *   New Row 1:\n    *   Replace Row 2 with (Row 2 - s² * Row 4):\n        *   (-s² - 1) - s²(-s - 1) = -s² - 1 + s³ + s² = s³ - 1\n        *   s² - s²(1) = 0\n        *   New Row 2: [s³ - 1, 0]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[    0    ,    0   ]\n[  s³ - 1,    0   ]\n[     s    ,    0   ]\n[   -s - 1,    1   ]\n\n2.  Use Row 3 to simplify the new Row 2.\n    *   Polynomial division gives: s³ - 1 = s²(s) - 1.\n    *   Replace the new Row 2 with (New Row 2 - s² * Row 3):\n        *   (s³ - 1) - s²(s) = -1\n        *   0 - s²(0) = 0\n        *   New Row 2 becomes: [-1, 0]\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[    0    ,    0   ]\n[    -1   ,    0   ]\n[     s    ,    0   ]\n[   -s - 1,    1   ]\n\n3.  Use the updated Row 2 ([-1, 0]) to simplify Rows 3 and 4.\n    *   Replace Row 3 with (Row 3 + s * New Row 2):\n        *   s + s(-1) = 0\n        *   0 + s(0) = 0\n        *   New Row 3:\n    *   Replace Row 4 with (Row 4 - (s+1) * New Row 2):\n        *   (-s - 1) - (s+1)(-1) = -s - 1 + s + 1 = 0\n        *   1 - (s+1)(0) = 1\n        *   New Row 4:\n\nThe matrix is now fully reduced to:\n[    0    ,    0   ]\n[    -1   ,    0   ]\n[    0    ,    0   ]\n[    0    ,    1   ]\n\n**Step 3: Extract the GCRD.**\nThe GCRD is formed by the non-zero rows of the reduced matrix.\nThe non-zero rows are [-1, 0] and. We can arrange them as a matrix:\nG(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1]\n\nGreatest common divisors are unique up to a left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a matrix with a non-zero constant determinant). We can multiply our resulting G(s) by the unimodular matrix [-1, 0; 0, 1] to obtain a simpler form:\nG'(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [1, 0; 0, 1]\n\nThis is the identity matrix, I. An identity matrix is unimodular, as its determinant is 1. When the GCRD is a unimodular matrix, the original matrices are said to be right coprime.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[\n,\n\n]>>>"
