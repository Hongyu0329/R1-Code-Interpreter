In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the leading-order behavior of the generating function H(s,s′) in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero is given by H(s,s′)≈−∣s′−s∣. The influence of the boundary's local curvature κ(s) on the generating function's expansion is first introduced at the third-order term, with a correction of the form −(κ(s)²/24)∣s′−s∣³. This demonstrates that the deviation from the simple arc-length distance is proportional to the square of the curvature, fundamentally linking the local geometry of the boundary to the billiard system's dynamical properties in this asymptotic regime.
