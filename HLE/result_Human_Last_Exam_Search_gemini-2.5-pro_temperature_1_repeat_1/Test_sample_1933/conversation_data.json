    "The VC dimension of the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with a schema $S$ containing 4 unary predicates is 4.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Concepts\nA formula in the specified logic, $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, with one free variable, say $x$, defines a \"concept.\" The schema $S$ provides four unary predicates: $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n\nAn element in a model can be characterized by its \"type,\" which is a vector of 4 boolean values indicating the truth of each predicate for that element (e.g., `(true, false, true, true)`). There are $2^4 = 16$ possible types.\n\nThe formulas in this logic that define concepts have a specific structure. A general formula $\\phi(x)$ is logically equivalent to a conjunction of atomic predicates on $x$, combined with a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\nFor example, $\\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y))$ is equivalent to $P_1(x) \\land (\\exists y P_2(y))$. The part in the parenthesis is a sentence that is either true or false for the entire model.\n\nThis means any definable concept is determined by a formula of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some subset of indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. These formulas correspond to **monotone conjunctions** of the four boolean variables representing the predicates. The existential sentences and the constants $\\top$ (true) and $\\bot$ (false) ensure that these concepts or the empty set can be realized in a suitably chosen model.\n\n### 2. Determining the VC Dimension\nThe problem is thus equivalent to finding the VC dimension of the class of concepts defined by monotone conjunctions over 4 variables. The VC dimension for this class is known to be equal to the number of variables, which is 4.\n\nTo prove that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must show that a set of 4 points can be shattered. Consider the following set of 4 points (or \"types\"), where each point is a vector in $\\{0,1\\}^4$:\n*   $v_1 = (0, 1, 1, 1)$\n*   $v_2 = (1, 0, 1, 1)$\n*   $v_3 = (1, 1, 0, 1)$\n*   $v_4 = (1, 1, 1, 0)$\n\nFor any subset of these four points, we can find a monotone conjunction that selects exactly that subset. For instance, to select the subset $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, we can use the concept formula $P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$. This formula is true for $v_1$ and $v_2$ (since their 3rd and 4th components are 1) but false for $v_3$ and $v_4$ (since their 3rd and 4th components, respectively, are 0). This construction can be generalized for any subset, proving that this set of 4 points can be shattered.\n\nTo prove that the VC dimension is no more than 4, one must show that no set of 5 points can be shattered. This is a standard result in learning theory for monotone conjunctions. Any set of $n+1$ points cannot be shattered by monotone conjunctions over $n$ variables.\n\nTherefore, for 4 unary predicates, the VC dimension is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
