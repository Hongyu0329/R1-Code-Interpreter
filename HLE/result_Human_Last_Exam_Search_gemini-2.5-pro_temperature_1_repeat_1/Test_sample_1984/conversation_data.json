    "To find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, we first need to determine the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, for the given differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t).\n$$\n\n**1. Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. We set the right-hand side of the equation to zero and solve for $x$:\n$$\n-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic factor is a perfect square:\n$$\n-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThis equation gives us two equilibrium points: $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**2. Determine the stability of the equilibrium points**\n\nTo determine the stability of each equilibrium point, we use the stability test for one-dimensional autonomous differential equations. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    $$\n    f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n    $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    $$\n    f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x = 1$.\n    The function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$), the term $(x-1)^2$ is positive, and the term $-x$ is negative. Thus, $f(x) < 0$. This means that to the right of $x=1$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$, and assuming $x>0$), the term $(x-1)^2$ is positive, and the term $-x$ is negative. Thus, $f(x) < 0$. This means that to the left of $x=1$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$.\n\n    Since trajectories starting from one side of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is a semi-stable equilibrium point, which is considered unstable by the standard definition of stability (Lyapunov stability).\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nSo, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m = 1$.\n\n**3. Calculate the final expression**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
