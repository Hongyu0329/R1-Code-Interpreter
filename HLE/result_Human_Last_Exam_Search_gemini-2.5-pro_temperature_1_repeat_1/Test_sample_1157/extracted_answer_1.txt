The management involves immediate systemic stabilization of her diabetes and trauma care, followed by a long-term plan for a removable partial denture. Given her uncontrolled diabetes, a flexible thermoplastic resin denture is recommended due to its biocompatibility and reduced risk of microbial colonization. The primary abutment teeth would be the left central incisor and the left second premolar to ensure stability and support. The SNB angle of 88Â° indicates mandibular prognathism, which must be considered in the prosthetic design to ensure proper occlusion. The cells of interest are fibroblasts, keratinocytes, osteoblasts, and immune cells, all of which are negatively impacted by her diabetic state, leading to delayed and impaired healing.
