    "For the Gauss class number problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 has been determined as part of the complete classification of imaginary quadratic fields for class numbers up to 100.\n\nBased on the work of Mark Watkins in his paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" there are 206 negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48. This result is a component of a larger project that has successfully identified all such discriminants for class numbers through 100.\n\nThe problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields with a specific class number is a classic question in number theory. Following foundational work by Heegner, Baker, and Stark for class number 1, and subsequent advancements by others for other small class numbers, Watkins completed the classification for all class numbers up to 100.\n\n<<<206>>>"
