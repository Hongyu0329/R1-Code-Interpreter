To simulate the correlations from a general set of POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state, the minimal resources required on average, in addition to a local hidden variable model, are **two bits of classical communication**. If the set of allowed measurements is restricted to traceless binary POVMs, this cost reduces to one bit of communication. Alternatively, using non-signaling resources, **one PR-box** is sufficient for the important subclass of projective measurements, but at least two are required for more general cases, with the precise minimal number for arbitrary POVMs not being definitively established.
