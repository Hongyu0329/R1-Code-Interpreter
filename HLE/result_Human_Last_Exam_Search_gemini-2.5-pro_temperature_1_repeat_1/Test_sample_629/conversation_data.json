    "The minimal grid number of a knot, also known as its arc index, is the smallest integer 'n' for which the knot can be represented on an n x n grid. For the trefoil knot (designated as 3‚ÇÅ), which is an alternating knot with a minimal crossing number of 3, the minimal grid number is 5. This can be calculated using the formula for alternating knots, where the arc index is the crossing number plus two (3 + 2 = 5). The trefoil knot is also the torus knot T(3,2), and for a torus knot T(r,s), the arc index is r + s, which again gives 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nResearch has shown that for a grid number of 5, there are a total of 10 distinct grid diagrams that form the trefoil knot. The trefoil knot is a chiral knot, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. The two versions are known as the left-hand trefoil and the right-hand trefoil. The 10 minimal grid diagrams are distributed equally between these two chiral forms.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand trefoil knot has 5 minimal grid diagrams, and the right-hand trefoil knot has the other 5. The count of 5 is considered up to the standard equivalences of translation and rotation of the grid.\n\n<<<E>>>"
