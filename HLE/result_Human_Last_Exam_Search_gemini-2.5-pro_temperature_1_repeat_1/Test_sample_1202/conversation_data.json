    "After a gene is duplicated, it becomes redundant. The most common fate for one of the copies is to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as pseudogenization. This leads to the loss of the duplicate gene, not its retention. Therefore, pseudogenization (B) is the most frequent outcome but not a mechanism for retention.\n\nFor a duplicated gene to be retained in the genome, there must be a selective advantage to keeping both copies. The primary mechanisms by which this occurs are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is a process where one copy of the gene retains its original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new function. This is an adaptive process driven by positive selection for the new functionality. While a crucial source of evolutionary novelty, it relies on the relatively rare occurrence of a beneficial mutation creating a new function before one copy is lost.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization** describes a scenario where the ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns (e.g., in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that inactivate different sub-functions. As a result, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally performed. This is often considered a more common mechanism for preserving duplicates because it can occur through neutral or nearly neutral degenerative mutations, which are more frequent than beneficial, new-function mutations. By partitioning the ancestral functions, both copies become indispensable, ensuring their retention and allowing them to diverge. Some models even suggest that subfunctionalization acts as a transitional state that preserves genes from being lost, creating an opportunity for eventual neofunctionalization.\n\n*   **Gene conversion** is a process that homogenizes the sequences of duplicated genes, which generally counteracts their divergence. While it plays a role in the evolution of gene families, it is not the primary mechanism for retaining duplicates through functional divergence.\n\n*   **Adaptive radiation** is a macroevolutionary pattern of diversification of species, which can be fueled by gene duplication. However, it is not the molecular mechanism itself responsible for the retention of specific duplicate genes within a genome.\n\nComparing neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, the latter is often considered the more probable initial mechanism for the retention and subsequent divergence of duplicated genes. This is because it relies on more common, degenerative mutations to partition ancestral functions, rather than the rarer evolution of a completely new function.\n\n<<<D>>>"
