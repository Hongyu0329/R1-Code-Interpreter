    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, up to conjugacy by the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, is given by the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of $G$, which is of type $E_8$.\n\nThe classification of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a classical result in the theory of finite reductive groups. The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of maximal tori of $G$ that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is in a one-to-one correspondence with the set of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the corresponding Weyl group is denoted $W(E_8)$. The problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$. This number has been computed and is a well-known result in the theory of reflection groups.\n\nAccording to the work of R. W. Carter, who classified the conjugacy classes of all exceptional Weyl groups in 1972, the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has exactly 112 conjugacy classes.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is 112. This number is independent of the size $q$ of the finite field.\n\n<<<112>>>"
