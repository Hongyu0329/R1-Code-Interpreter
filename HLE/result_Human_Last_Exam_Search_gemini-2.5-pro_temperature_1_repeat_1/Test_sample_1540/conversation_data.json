    "<<<```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program lexicographically compares two strings of the same length,\n * ignoring the case of the letters. It is designed to be memory-efficient.\n *\n * The approach is to read the first string into a buffer. The second string\n * is not stored entirely; instead, it is read from the standard input\n * character by character and immediately compared against the corresponding\n * character of the first string. This avoids allocating a second buffer.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // s1: A buffer to store the first input string.\n    // The maximum length is 100, plus one byte for the null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // getchar() is used to consume the single newline character that remains\n    // in the input buffer after scanf reads the first string. This correctly\n    // positions the input stream at the beginning of the second string.\n    getchar();\n\n    // i: An integer loop index to iterate through the characters of s1.\n    int i = 0;\n\n    // The loop continues as long as the character at the current index i of s1\n    // is not the null terminator ('\\0'). Since the problem guarantees that both\n    // strings are of the same length, we only need to check for the end of s1.\n    while (s1[i]) {\n        // s2_char: A variable to hold the character read from the second string.\n        // It must be of type 'int' to correctly handle the End-Of-File (EOF)\n        // value that getchar() can return.\n        int s2_char = getchar();\n\n        // The characters from both strings are converted to lowercase before comparison\n        // to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n        // It's good practice to cast the char from s1 to 'unsigned char' before\n        // passing it to tolower() to prevent issues with negative char values.\n        int c1_lower = tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]);\n        int c2_lower = tolower(s2_char);\n\n        // If the character from the first string is lexicographically smaller,\n        // print -1 and terminate the program.\n        if (c1_lower < c2_lower) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // If the character from the first string is lexicographically larger,\n        // print 1 and terminate the program.\n        if (c1_lower > c2_lower) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // If the characters are equal, move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` is calculated by summing the sizes of all variables declared within the `main` function. The calculation assumes a standard C environment, common in competitive programming, where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n1.  **`char s1[101];`**: This is a character array to store the first string.\n    *   The size of a `char` is guaranteed to be 1 byte.\n    *   The array has 101 elements (100 for the maximum string length and 1 for the null terminator).\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **`int i;`**: This is an integer variable used as a loop counter.\n    *   On most modern 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, the size of an `int` is 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n3.  **`int s2_char;`**: This integer variable stores the character read from the input stream by `getchar()`. It is an `int` to correctly handle the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n4.  **`int c1_lower;`, `int c2_lower;`**: These integer variables store the lowercase versions of the characters being compared.\n    *   Memory = `2 * sizeof(int)` = `2 * 4` = **8 bytes**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\n\nm = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `s2_char`) + (memory for `c1_lower` and `c2_lower`)\nm = 101 + 4 + 4 + 8 = **117 bytes**\n\nNote: A slightly more optimized version could avoid the `c1_lower` and `c2_lower` variables by performing the `tolower` calls directly within the `if` conditions. In that highly optimized case, the memory usage would be:\nm = 101 + 4 + 4 = **109 bytes**. The provided code uses intermediate variables for clarity, resulting in 117 bytes. Both are valid interpretations of memory usage for this logic. We will consider the version with clearer variables.\n\n**m = 117 bytes**>>>"
