    "The pattern in the sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` becomes clear if we focus on the latter part.\n\n1.  We can observe a group of three consecutive `3`s (`3 3 3`).\n2.  This is followed by two consecutive `2`s (`2 2`).\n3.  This suggests a pattern of groups of three identical numbers, in descending order. First a group of `3`s, then a group of `2`s, and so on.\n4.  To complete the group of `2`s, the next number in the sequence must be `2`. The sequence so far would be `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 2`.\n5.  Following this pattern, the next group of numbers should be three `1`s. So, the next three numbers would be `1 1 1`.\n6.  Therefore, the next four elements of the sequence are `2, 1, 1, 1`.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
