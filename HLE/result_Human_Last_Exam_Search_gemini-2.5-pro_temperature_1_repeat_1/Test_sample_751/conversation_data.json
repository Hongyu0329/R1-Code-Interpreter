    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we follow a systematic procedure. The core of this method lies in transforming the dual of the original system into controller canonical form. The transformation matrix obtained from this process is then used to find the observer canonical form of the original system.\n\n**1. System and Dual System Definition**\n\nThe original system is described by:\n*   x(k+1) = Ax(k)\n*   y(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\n*   A = [,,]\n*   C = [,]\n\nThe principle of duality connects the observability of a system (A, C) with the controllability of its dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ). Since the standard observer canonical form is defined for single-output systems, we must select one output from the original system to derive the transformation. Let's choose the first row of C, denoted as c₁, to form a single-output system for this purpose.\n\n*   c₁ =\n\nThe dual system is then defined by (A_d, b_d) = (Aᵀ, c₁ᵀ).\n\n**2. Transformation to Controller Canonical Form**\n\nFirst, we find the transformation matrix that converts the dual system into controller canonical form. This requires the controllability matrix (U) of the dual system and a matrix (W) derived from the characteristic polynomial of A.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of A is found to be:\n*   p(λ) = det(λI - A) = λ³ - 2λ² - 3λ + 2\n\nFrom this, we identify the coefficients a₁ = -2, a₂ = -3, a₃ = 2. These coefficients are used to construct the matrix W.\n\nThe controllability matrix U for the dual system is calculated. Using U and W, we compute the transformation matrix P_c = U * W.\n\n**3. Duality Transformation to Observer Canonical Form**\n\nThe transformation matrix P_o, which converts the original system into observer canonical form, is the transpose of the inverse of P_c (i.e., P_o = (P_c⁻¹)ᵀ). After calculating P_c⁻¹ and then its transpose, we get:\n\n*   P_o = [[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],, [-1, 0, 0]]\n\n**4. Calculating the New Matrix C**\n\nThe final step is to apply this transformation to the original output matrix C to find the new matrix C_o in the observer canonical form. The transformation is given by C_o = C * P_o.\n\n*   C_o = [,] * [[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],, [-1, 0, 0]]\n*   C_o = [, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]\n\nThis result is consistent with the methodology. The first row of C_o, which is, corresponds to the output c₁ that was used to derive the transformation, and it is in the canonical form as expected.\n\nTherefore, the value of the new matrix C is:\n\n<<<[, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
