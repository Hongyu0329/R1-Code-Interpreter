    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes**, the **fin lobes**, and the **vasomotor lobes**.\n\nThe brain of the dwarf cuttlefish is a complex structure with numerous distinct lobes. The palliovisceral lobe is part of the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is involved in controlling locomotion. Anatomical studies and 3D brain atlases of the dwarf cuttlefish reveal the spatial arrangement of these lobes.\n\nA posterior view of the cuttlefish brain shows that the posterior chromatophore lobes are situated towards the back. These lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass. The fin lobes, which control the movement of the fins, and the vasomotor lobes are also located in this posterior region, in close proximity to the palliovisceral lobe. The entire brain is encased posteriorly by rigid cartilage.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the vasomotor lobes.>>>"
