    "The probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a specific interval is determined by integrating the probability density function over that interval. For the second energy level (n=2), the probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶, or about 0.000658%.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **The Wavefunction**: The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a' is given by:\n    *   ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\n    For the n=2 state, this becomes:\n    *   ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)\n\n2.  **Probability Density**: The probability of finding the particle at a specific position x is given by the square of the wavefunction's magnitude, known as the probability density, P(x).\n    *   P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)\n    For the n=2 state, the wavefunction has a node (a point of zero probability) at the center of the box (x = a/2), because sin(2π(a/2)/a) = sin(π) = 0.\n\n3.  **Probability Calculation**: To find the probability of the particle being in the interval [0.495a, 0.505a], we must integrate the probability density over this range.\n    *   Probability = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ᵃ (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx\n\n4.  **Solving the Integral**:\n    *   Using the identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2, the integral becomes:\n        ∫ (1/a) * [1 - cos(4πx / a)] dx\n    *   Evaluating this integral from 0.495a to 0.505a gives:\n        (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] from 0.495a to 0.505a\n    *   Plugging in the limits of integration, the exact expression for the probability is:\n        0.01 - [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] / (4π)\n\n5.  **Numerical Result**:\n    *   This expression evaluates to approximately 6.5797 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nThis very small, but non-zero, probability indicates that while it is highly unlikely to find the particle exactly at the center node, there is a small chance of finding it in a very narrow interval surrounding the center.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
