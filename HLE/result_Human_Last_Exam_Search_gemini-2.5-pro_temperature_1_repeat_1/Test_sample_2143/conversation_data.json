    "According to Veronika Campan's interpretation, the work in question is the Ten Commandments, and the individual who received and delivered them was Moses. The \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment, which forbids the creation of graven images. At the end of the Ten Commandments, the issue of another's material possessions is addressed through the commandments against stealing and, most notably, coveting what belongs to a neighbor.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
