    "When yellow and blue are combined, they produce the color green. In his color circle, Sir Isaac Newton associated the colors of the spectrum with musical notes from the Dorian mode, which starts on the note D.\n\nNewton's correlation of colors to musical notes is as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   **Green - G**\n*   **Blue - A**\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe range between the color produced by combining yellow and blue (green) and blue itself corresponds to the musical note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
