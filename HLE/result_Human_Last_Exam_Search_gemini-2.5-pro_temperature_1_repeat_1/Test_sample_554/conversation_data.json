    "Hypothetically, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar would depend on the specific chemical structure of the nanocar in question, as various designs exist. The term \"perfluorinated\" signifies that all hydrogen atoms in the original molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nFor a specific example, a research paper identifies a nanocar with a flexible chassis having the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. If this particular nanocar were to be perfluorinated, all 34 of its hydrogen atoms would be substituted with fluorine atoms. Therefore, this perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nIt is important to note that different nanocars have different numbers of atoms. For instance, the \"SPARC\" nanocar is composed of 70 atoms in total, including carbon and hydrogen. Another general description mentions that nanocars are composed of \"a few tens or hundreds of hydrogen and carbon atoms\". Consequently, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronated version would vary depending on the specific molecular design of the nanocar.\n\n<<<34>>>"
