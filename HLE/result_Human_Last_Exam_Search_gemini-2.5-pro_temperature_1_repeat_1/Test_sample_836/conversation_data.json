    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**. It is typically denoted as S(q, ω), where **q** represents the wavevector (momentum transfer) and **ω** represents the angular frequency (energy transfer).\n\nThe dynamic structure factor provides crucial information about the collective dynamics of particles in a system. It describes how the density fluctuations at a particular position and time are correlated with those at another position and time. This information is essential for understanding neutron scattering processes within a nuclear reactor or other nuclear systems.\n\nThe relationship is explicitly described in the context of neutron scattering theory, where the double differential scattering cross-section, a quantity that can be experimentally measured, is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor. The generalized pair correlation function, often referred to as the Van Hove correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at position **r** at time **t**, given that there was a particle at the origin at time t=0. The dynamic structure factor S(q, ω) is its Fourier transform in both space and time.\n\nIn practical applications within nuclear engineering and criticality safety, the dynamic structure factor is used in the form of the thermal scattering law, often denoted as S(α, β), where α and β are dimensionless variables for momentum and energy transfer, respectively. This formulation is used in nuclear data libraries to calculate neutron thermalization and its effect on reactor criticality.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
