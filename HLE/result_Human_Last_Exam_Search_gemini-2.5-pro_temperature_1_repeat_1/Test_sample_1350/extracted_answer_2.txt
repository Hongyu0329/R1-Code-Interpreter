In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, while no character is explicitly described as visiting a Roman city and recounting the tale of Romulus and Remus, there are characters who possess knowledge of Roman cities. The allusion to the Roman founding myth is present thematically, as scholarly analysis suggests the Romans' connection to a she-wolf is a symbolic appropriation of the Wolfings' own wolf emblem.
