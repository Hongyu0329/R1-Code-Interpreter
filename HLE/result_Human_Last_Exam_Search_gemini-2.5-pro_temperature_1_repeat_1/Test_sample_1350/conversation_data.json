    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, no single character is depicted as visiting a Roman city and explicitly describing the legend of Romulus and Remus. However, the narrative contains elements that strongly allude to this foundational myth of Rome, and knowledge of Roman urban life is present among the Goths.\n\nAn unnamed Wolfing warrior describes a Roman city as a \"garth full of mighty houses, with a wall of stone and lime around it, and... in every one of these garths lieth wealth untold heaped up'\". This indicates an awareness of the physical nature of Roman settlements.\n\nThematic analysis of the novel by scholars points to a deliberate parallel between the Romans and the Wolfings' own totem. The Wolfings bear a wolf on their banners and are marked with the image of a wolf. Scholarly interpretation suggests that the Romans' legendary founding by two brothers suckled by a she-wolf is an appropriation of the Wolfings' totemic emblem. This allusion highlights the clash of cultures and values between the communal, nature-revering Goths and the imperialistic, structured society of Rome.\n\nTherefore, while no character directly recounts the story of Romulus and Remus, the narrative implicitly references it through the symbolic conflict between the Roman she-wolf and the Gothic Wolfings.\n\n<<<In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, while no character is explicitly described as visiting a Roman city and recounting the tale of Romulus and Remus, there are characters who possess knowledge of Roman cities. The allusion to the Roman founding myth is present thematically, as scholarly analysis suggests the Romans' connection to a she-wolf is a symbolic appropriation of the Wolfings' own wolf emblem.>>>"
