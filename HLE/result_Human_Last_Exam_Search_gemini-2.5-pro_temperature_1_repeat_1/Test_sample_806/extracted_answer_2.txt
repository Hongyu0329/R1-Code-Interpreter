The biochemical reaction that initiated the process was a T-cell mediated cytotoxic immune response, triggered by the binding of the drug to specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules. This leads to the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes which release proteins, primarily granulysin, that cause widespread death of skin cells (keratinocytes), resulting in blister formation.
