    "Answering the request to solve for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\nThe equation can be written as $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\ln(i)}$.\nThe natural logarithm of $i$ is a multi-valued function in the complex plane. The principal value is $\\ln(i) = i\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The general form is $\\ln(i) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's define $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. The equation becomes a family of equations, one for each integer $k$:\n$zi = e^{ziA_k}$\n\nTo solve for $z$, we can make a substitution. Let $w = zi$. The equation transforms to:\n$w = e^{wA_k}$\n\nThis can be rearranged into the form that defines the Lambert W function.\n$1 = \\frac{e^{wA_k}}{w}$\n$1 = w^{-1}e^{wA_k}$\n$w = e^{wA_k}$\n$w e^{-wA_k} = 1$\nMultiply by $-A_k$:\n$(-wA_k)e^{-wA_k} = -A_k$\n\nThis equation is of the form $X e^X = Y$, where the solution is given by the Lambert W function, $X = W(Y)$.\nHere, $X = -wA_k$ and $Y = -A_k$.\nSo, $-wA_k = W(-A_k)$.\n\nThe Lambert W function is also multi-valued, with branches indexed by an integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, denoted as $W_n(Y)$.\nSo, the solutions for $w$ are given by:\n$w_{k,n} = -\\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k}$\n\nSince we substituted $w = zi$, we can find the solutions for $z$ using $z = w/i = -iw$:\n$z_{k,n} = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k} \\right) = i \\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k}$\n\nThis formula generates all solutions for $z$ by considering all integer values for $k$ and all integer branch indices $n$ for the Lambert W function.\n\nWe can categorize the solutions into several types:\n\n### Real Integer Solutions\nTwo simple solutions are $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n*   **z = 1**: Let's check: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$. So $z=1$ is a solution. This solution can be generated from the general formula. For any integer $k$, the value $w = -iA_k$ is a solution to $we^w = -A_k$. This corresponds to a specific branch $n$. This gives $z = i(-iA_k)/A_k = 1$.\n*   **z = -1**: Let's check: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. So $z=-1$ is a solution. This solution is also generated from the general formula. For any integer $k$, the value $w = iA_k$ is a solution to $we^w = -A_k$. This also corresponds to a specific branch $n$. This gives $z = i(iA_k)/A_k = -1$.\n\n### Purely Imaginary Solutions\nFor any integer $k < 0$, the value $-A_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ is a positive real number. For a positive real argument, the principal branch of the Lambert W function, $W_0(-A_k)$, is a single positive real number.\nLet $k = -j$ for $j = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\nThen $A_{-j} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2j\\pi < 0$.\nThe solutions are given by the principal branch $n=0$:\n$z_{-j, 0} = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2j\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2j\\pi} = -i \\frac{W_0(2j\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2})}{2j\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}$\nSince $W_0(x)$ is real and positive for $x>0$, these solutions are purely imaginary, lying on the negative imaginary axis.\nFor each $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, there is a unique such solution. For instance, for $k=-1$ ($j=1$), the solution is $z = -i \\frac{W_0(3\\pi/2)}{3\\pi/2} \\approx -i \\frac{1.233}{4.712} \\approx -0.2617i$.\n\n### Other Complex Solutions\nAll other combinations of integers $k$ and branch indices $n$ (not covered by the cases above) give complex solutions for $z$.\nThe formula for these solutions remains:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$\nThese solutions form an infinite discrete set in the complex plane.\n\nIn summary, the solutions to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are given by the set:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k$ and $n$.\n\nThis set includes:\n1.  The integer solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions $z_j = -i \\frac{W_0(2j\\pi - \\pi/2)}{2j\\pi - \\pi/2}$ for $j=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n3.  An infinite number of other complex solutions.\n\n<<<The set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $W_n$ denotes the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This set includes the integer solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions, and an infinite number of other complex solutions.>>>"
