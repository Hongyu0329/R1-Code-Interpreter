The set of all solutions for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ is given by $z_{k,n} = i \frac{W_n(-(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi))}{\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi}$ for all integers $k, n \in \mathbb{Z}$, where $W_n$ denotes the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This set includes the integer solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions, and an infinite number of other complex solutions.
