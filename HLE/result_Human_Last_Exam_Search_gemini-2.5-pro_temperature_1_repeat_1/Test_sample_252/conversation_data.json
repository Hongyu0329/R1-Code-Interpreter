    "To reconstruct a full three-dimensional spectral volume (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single two-dimensional image, a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is employed. This method requires capturing multiple, spectrally dispersed projections of the scene onto a single detector simultaneously.\n\nThe key component for achieving this is a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating. A 2D grating can be understood as two one-dimensional (1D) gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other. This arrangement disperses the incoming light into a grid of diffraction orders on the detector. A single 1D grating would only disperse light along one axis, which is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction of the data cube.\n\nThese multiple diffracted images, each corresponding to a different \"projection\" or \"view\" of the scene at various wavelengths, provide the necessary data for a computed tomography algorithm to reconstruct the (x, y, Î») spectral data cube from the single snapshot. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed is functionally two, typically combined into a single 2D grating element.\n\n<<<B>>>"
