    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will first calculate the uncertainty in momentum using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and then determine the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n**1. Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant. The relationship is given by the formula:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ h / (4π)\n\nwhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position, given as 10 pm (10 x 10⁻¹² m).\n*   h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n\nΔp = h / (4π * Δx)\nΔp = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (4 * π * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Momentum of the Electron in the First Bohr Orbit (p):**\n\nAccording to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in a given orbit is quantized and is given by the formula L = n * h / (2π), where 'n' is the principal quantum number. For the first Bohr orbit, n=1.\n\nThe angular momentum is also related to the linear momentum (p) and the radius of the orbit (r) by L = p * r.\n\nTherefore, for the first Bohr orbit (n=1):\n\np = L / r = (1 * h / (2π)) / r\n\nThe radius of the first Bohr orbit (the Bohr radius, a₀) is approximately 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\np = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * π * 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np ≈ 1.99 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Ratio of Uncertainty in Momentum to Momentum:**\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum:\n\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio = (5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s) / (1.99 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nRatio ≈ 2.65\n\n<<<2.65>>>"
