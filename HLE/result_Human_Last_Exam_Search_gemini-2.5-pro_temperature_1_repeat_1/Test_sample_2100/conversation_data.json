    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The question from Voznesensky's poem, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" found its answer not in a physical discovery in the late 1980s, but through the immense popularity of a rock opera.\n\nVoznesensky's poem \"Avos!\" (also known as \"Story Under Full Sail\") formed the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which premiered in Moscow in 1981. The opera, with music by Alexey Rybnikov, tells the story of Rezanov's 1806 expedition to California on the ships *Juno* and *Avos* and his tragic romance with Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of San Francisco.\n\nThe show became a cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union throughout the 1980s, bringing Rezanov's story of exploration and lost love to a vast audience. Rezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807, while on his way back to St. Petersburg to seek permission to marry Concepción. His original burial site was destroyed by the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe \"emergence\" of the answer to the location of his grave in the 1980s was, therefore, a cultural one. Through the opera, Voznesensky resurrected Rezanov's memory, effectively providing a memorial in the hearts of millions and ensuring the \"joy-discovering sailor\" would not be forgotten. A physical monument was eventually re-erected at his presumed burial site in Krasnoyarsk, and in 2000, a new memorial cross was dedicated, with inscriptions quoting a famous ballad from the rock opera.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
