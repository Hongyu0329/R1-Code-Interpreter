    "Without the influence of the Old Norse language following the Viking invasions, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **suster**.\n\nThe original Old English, or Anglo-Saxon, word for a female sibling was ***sweostor*** or ***swuster***. This word comes from the Proto-Germanic `*swestr-`, making it a cognate of the Old Norse word, but not a derivative of it.\n\nThe Old Norse word for sister was ***systir***. During the period of Norse settlement in England (the Danelaw), the Old English language was heavily influenced by Old Norse. Many everyday words, including pronouns like \"they,\" \"them,\" and \"their,\" were adopted from the Vikings.\n\nIn the case of \"sister,\" the Old English word *sweostor* naturally evolved into the Middle English form ***suster***. However, the influence of the Old Norse *systir* led to the vowel changing from \"u\" to \"i,\" giving us the modern word \"sister\". Had this Norse interaction not occurred, the native form *suster* would have likely continued its evolution, probably retaining its spelling and having a pronunciation similar to words like \"butter\" or \"cup.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
