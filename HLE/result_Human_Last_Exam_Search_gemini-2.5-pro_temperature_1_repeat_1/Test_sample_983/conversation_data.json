    "An analysis of the provided number sequence reveals that all its members are divisible by 6. The numbers are presented in ascending order.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352\n\nThis sequence is a subset of the multiples of 6. For instance, the multiple of 6 that follows 1020 is 1026, which is absent from the list. The rule determining which multiples of 6 are included is not immediately apparent. The differences between consecutive terms, the sum of their digits, or other common mathematical properties do not follow a simple, discernible pattern.\n\nWithout a clear rule governing the selection of the numbers, it is not possible to determine the next term with certainty. However, the most straightforward continuation, based on the fundamental property of the sequence, would be the next multiple of 6 after the last term.\n\nThe last number in the sequence is 2352. The next multiple of 6 is:\n2352 + 6 = 2358\n\n<<<2358>>>"
