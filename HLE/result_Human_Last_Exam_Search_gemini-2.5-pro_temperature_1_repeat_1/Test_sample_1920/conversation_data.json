    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we first need to find the prime factorization of $d$. A search in a number theory context reveals that $160797 = 3 \\times 53599$. Another source indicates that the prime factorization of 160797 is $3 \\times 7 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 31$. By dividing 160797 by 3, we can attempt to factor 53599. Let's verify this factorization: $7 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 31 = 91 \\times 527 = 47957$. This is not 53599.  Therefore, the provided factorization for 160797 seems incorrect in the search result.\n\nLet's use a computational tool to factor $d=53599$.\n$53599 = 13 \\times 4123$.\n$4123$ is not divisible by small primes. Let's try 13 again: $4123/13 = 317.15..$. Trying 17: $4123/17 = 242.5...$. Trying 19: $4123/19=217$. So $53599 = 13 \\times 19 \\times 217$. And $217 = 7 \\times 31$.\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo the corresponding prime factor of $d$. Let $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$. Then $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the individual characters $\\chi_i$. We need this order to be 6.\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nFor a prime $p$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $p-1$. The number of primitive characters modulo $p$ of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $p-1$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet's find the orders of the groups of units for our primes:\n*   $p_1=7$: $\\phi(7-1) = \\phi(6) = (2-1)(3-1) = 2$.\n*   $p_2=13$: $\\phi(13-1) = \\phi(12) = \\phi(4 \\times 3) = \\phi(2^2)\\phi(3) = (2^2-2^1)(3-1) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   $p_3=19$: $\\phi(19-1) = \\phi(18) = \\phi(2 \\times 9) = \\phi(2)\\phi(9) = 1 \\times (3^2-3^1) = 6$.\n*   $p_4=31$: $\\phi(31-1) = \\phi(30) = \\phi(2 \\times 3 \\times 5) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3)\\phi(5) = 1 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nLet $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We need $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$. This means the orders $o_i$ must be divisors of 6, i.e., $o_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Also, at least one order must be a multiple of 3, and at least one must be a multiple of 2.\n\nLet's count the number of primitive characters of these orders for each prime factor:\n*   **For $p_1=7$ ($p_1-1=6$):**\n    *   Order 1: $\\phi(1)=1$\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n*   **For $p_2=13$ ($p_2-1=12$):**\n    *   Order 1: $\\phi(1)=1$\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n*   **For $p_3=19$ ($p_3-1=18$):**\n    *   Order 1: $\\phi(1)=1$\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n*   **For $p_4=31$ ($p_4-1=30$):**\n    *   Order 1: $\\phi(1)=1$\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n\nLet $N_k$ be the number of characters for a given prime whose order divides $k$. Let $n_k$ be the number of characters of order exactly $k$.\nFor each prime $p_i$, the number of primitive characters of an order $k$ that divides $p_i-1$ is $\\phi(k)$.\nLet $C_i(S)$ be the set of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ whose order is in the set $S$. We want to find the number of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))=6$.\n\nLet $A_k$ be the set of tuples where all orders divide $k$. The total number of choices is the product of the number of choices for each component.\nNumber of characters with order dividing 6: $n_1+n_2+n_3+n_6 = 1+1+2+2 = 6$. This is true for all four primes.\nSo, $|A_6| = 6^4 = 1296$.\n\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The set of characters of order 6 is the set of characters whose orders divide 6, but not 3, and not 2.\nLet $S_6$ be the set of tuples where the lcm of orders is 6.\n$S_6 = A_6 \\setminus (A_2 \\cup A_3)$.\n$|S_6| = |A_6| - |A_2 \\cup A_3| = |A_6| - (|A_2| + |A_3| - |A_2 \\cap A_3|)$.\n$A_2 \\cap A_3 = A_1$, since an order divides both 2 and 3 if and only if it divides 1.\n\n*   $|A_6|$: For each prime, the number of characters with order dividing 6 is $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+1+2+2=6$. So, $|A_6| = 6^4 = 1296$.\n*   $|A_3|$: For each prime, the number of characters with order dividing 3 is $\\phi(1)+\\phi(3) = 1+2=3$. So, $|A_3| = 3^4 = 81$.\n*   $|A_2|$: For each prime, the number of characters with order dividing 2 is $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2) = 1+1=2$. So, $|A_2| = 2^4 = 16$.\n*   $|A_1|$: For each prime, the number of characters with order dividing 1 is $\\phi(1)=1$. So, $|A_1| = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nNumber of characters = $|A_6| - |A_3| - |A_2| + |A_1| = 1296 - 81 - 16 + 1 = 1200$.\n\n"
