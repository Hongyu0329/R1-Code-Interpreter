    "Let C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3 and X = Sym^15(C) be its 15th symmetric power. We want to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted as ρ(X).\n\n### Step 1: Relating the Néron-Severi rank of Sym^d(C) to its Jacobian\n\nThe Néron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of a curve C, Sym^d(C), is closely related to the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian, J(C). For a curve of genus g, when the degree d is sufficiently large, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of Sym^d(C) is equal to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of J(C).\n\nA known result in the theory of algebraic curves states that for d ≥ g, the Picard number of Sym^d(C) is equal to the Picard number of the Jacobian of C.\nIn our case, g=3 and d=15, so the condition d ≥ g is satisfied. Therefore, we have the equality:\nρ(X) = ρ(Sym^15(C)) = ρ(J(C)).\n\nThis reduces the problem to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Step 2: The range of the Néron-Severi rank for Jacobians of genus 3 curves\n\nThe Jacobian J(C) of a genus 3 curve C is a principally polarized abelian threefold (an abelian variety of dimension 3). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension g is bounded above by h¹¹(A) = g². For g=3, this maximum is 3² = 9.\n\n**Smallest Possible Rank:**\n\nFor a *generic* Riemann surface C of genus 3, its Jacobian J(C) is a simple abelian variety. This means it is not isogenous to a product of lower-dimensional abelian varieties. Furthermore, its ring of endomorphisms is as small as possible, namely End(J(C)) ≅ ℤ. In this case, the Néron-Severi group NS(J(C)) is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Consequently, the rank is:\nρ(J(C)) = 1.\nThis is the smallest possible rank for a non-zero abelian variety.\n\n**Largest Possible Rank:**\n\nThe largest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of an abelian threefold is 9. An abelian variety that achieves this maximum rank is said to have complex multiplication (CM) and is often called a singular abelian variety (in the sense of having many endomorphisms).\n\nWe need to determine if there exists a genus 3 curve C whose Jacobian J(C) has a Néron-Severi rank of 9. Such curves exist. A prime example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation:\nx⁴ + y⁴ = z⁴\n\nThis is a smooth plane quartic curve, which has genus g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3. Its Jacobian, J(F₄), is an abelian threefold with complex multiplication. It has been established that the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is maximal.\nρ(J(F₄)) = 9.\n\nThus, the largest possible rank is 9.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = Sym^15(C) is equal to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, ρ(J(C)).\n- The smallest possible rank is 1, achieved for any generic genus 3 curve.\n- The largest possible rank is 9, achieved for specific curves with complex multiplication, such as the Fermat quartic.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 1, and the largest is 9.\n\n<<<\nThe smallest possible rank is 1.\nThe largest possible rank is 9.\n>>>"
