    "A finite group can contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 in a limited number of cases. A comprehensive classification was provided by M. Giudici and S. Hart, identifying all such finite groups and their corresponding product-free sets. A non-empty subset *S* of a group *G* is deemed product-free if for any elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a*=*b*), their product *ab* is not an element of *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nBased on the classification, there are precisely 11 types of finite groups that can contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. These are categorized based on the properties of the elements in the set and the structure of the subgroup they generate.\n\nThe classification can be broken down as follows:\n\n### Cases Where the Set Contains No Involutions\n\nIn this category, the product-free set *S* = {*a*, *b*} generates a cyclic group, and neither *a* nor *b* is an involution (an element of order 2). The possible groups and their corresponding maximal product-free sets are:\n\n*   **Cyclic group C₄:** The set must be {*a*, *a*⁻¹}, where *a* is a generator of the group.\n*   **Cyclic group C₅:** The set is {*a*, *a*⁻¹} for a generator *a*.\n*   **Cyclic group C₆:** The set is {*a*, *a*⁴}, with *a* being a generator.\n*   **Cyclic group C₇:** There are three possible sets: {*a*, *a*⁻¹}, {*a*, *a*³}, and {*a*, *a*⁵}, for a generator *a*.\n*   **Cyclic group C₈:** The set can be {*a*, *a*⁶} for a generator *a*. Additionally, *C*₈ can have the maximal product-free set {*x*², *x*⁶}, where *x* is a generator.\n\n### Cases Where the Set Contains at Least One Involution\n\nThis category includes sets where at least one element has an order of 2.\n\n*   **Klein four-group C₂ × C₂:** Any pair of distinct involutions forms a maximal product-free set.\n*   **Cyclic group C₆:** The set consists of the unique involution and any element of order 3.\n*   **Dihedral group D₆:** The set is composed of any involution and any element of order 3.\n\n### Cases Where the Set Contains Two Commuting Involutions\n\nThis scenario considers sets where both elements are involutions and they commute with each other.\n\n*   **The group C₄ × C₂:** For generators *x* of order 4 and *y* of order 2, the sets can be {*x*², *y*} or {*x*², *x*²y}.\n*   **The group C₂ × Q₈ (the direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and the quaternion group of order 8):** The set can be {*a*, *b*} or {*a*, *ab*}, where *a* is an element of order 2 in Q₈ and *b* is the generator of C₂.\n\n### An Additional Special Case\n\n*   **Generalized quaternion group Q₁₂:** This group, defined by the presentation ⟨*g*, *h* | *g*⁶ = 1, *g*³ = *h*², *h*g* = *g*⁻¹*h*⟩, contains the maximal product-free set {*g*³, *g*²}.\n\nIn summary, there are **11** such non-isomorphic finite groups.\n\n<<<11>>>"
