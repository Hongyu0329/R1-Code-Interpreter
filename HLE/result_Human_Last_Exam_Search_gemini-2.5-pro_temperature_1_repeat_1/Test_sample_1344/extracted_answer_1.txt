A Zirconium-based single-site catalyst featuring a redox-switchable ligand (such as a ferrocene-containing bis(imino)pyridine or salen-type ligand) and supported on sulfated alumina (AlS) represents the optimal combination. The process would be a two-stage system: 1) Polymerization with the ligand in its reduced state, followed by 2) Hydrogenolysis, where a chemical oxidant switches the ligand to its oxidized state, and the introduction of hydrogen and heat activates the catalyst for the efficient breakdown of the polyolefin into short saturated alkanes.
