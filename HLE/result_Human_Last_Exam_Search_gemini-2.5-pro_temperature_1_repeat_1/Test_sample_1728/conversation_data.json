    "I have begun by searching for the definitions of the sum of graphs and the chromatic number. The search results provide a good definition of the chromatic number of a graph and a cycle graph. Specifically, the chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) is 2 if \\(n\\) is even and 3 if \\(n\\) is odd.\n\nHowever, the initial search did not yield a clear and consistent definition of the \"sum of three cycles.\" There are different ways to combine graphs, such as the Cartesian sum (also called disjunction) and the join of graphs. The term \"sum\" can be ambiguous. To proceed, I need to clarify what \"sum of three cycles\" means in this context. It could mean the disjoint union, the join, or another graph product. The maximal chromatic number will heavily depend on this definition.\n\nI will assume the most common interpretation in the absence of further specification, which is often the \"join\" of graphs when discussing chromatic numbers, as suggested by one of the search results. The join of graphs \\(G_1 + G_2 + ... + G_k\\) is formed by taking the disjoint union of the graphs and adding all possible edges between vertices of different graphs. If this is the intended meaning, I can proceed with the calculation. If \"sum\" refers to the disjoint union, the answer will be different. Let's proceed with the \"join\" interpretation and if needed, I can explore other interpretations.\n\nI will now proceed to the next steps of my original plan, but with the explicit assumption that \"sum\" means the join of the graphs.The search results confirm that for the join of graphs, the chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs. Specifically, a search result states, \"The chromatic number of the join of two graphs is equal to the sum of the two chromatic numbers.\" This can be extended to the join of three graphs. Let the three cycles be \\(C_{n_1}\\), \\(C_{n_2}\\), and \\(C_{n_3}\\). The graph \\(G\\) is their join, denoted \\(G = C_{n_1} + C_{n_2} + C_{n_3}\\). The chromatic number of \\(G\\) is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(C_{n_1}) + \\chi(C_{n_2}) + \\chi(C_{n_3})\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) depends on whether \\(n\\) is even or odd. If \\(n\\) is even, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\). If \\(n\\) is odd, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\).\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\), we need to maximize the sum of the chromatic numbers of the three cycles. The maximum chromatic number for a single cycle is 3, which occurs when the cycle has an odd number of vertices.\n\nTherefore, to achieve the maximal chromatic number for \\(G\\), all three cycles must have an odd number of vertices. In this case, \\(\\chi(C_{n_1}) = 3\\), \\(\\chi(C_{n_2}) = 3\\), and \\(\\chi(C_{n_3}) = 3\\), assuming \\(n_1, n_2, n_3\\) are all odd.\n\nThe maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is the sum of these maximum individual chromatic numbers.\n\nThus, \\(\\chi(G)_{max} = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\).\n\nThis is based on the assumption that \"sum of three cycles\" refers to the join operation, which seems to be the standard interpretation in this context. Other interpretations of \"sum\" like disjoint union would result in a much smaller chromatic number (the maximum of the individual chromatic numbers, which would be 3). Given the phrasing of the question, \"maximal chromatic number,\" the join operation is the most logical interpretation as it yields the largest possible value.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n- Let the graph G be the join of three cycles C1, C2, and C3.\n- The chromatic number of the join of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers: χ(G) = χ(C1) + χ(C2) + χ(C3).\n- The chromatic number of a cycle Cn is 2 if n is even, and 3 if n is odd.\n- To maximize χ(G), we must maximize the chromatic number of each individual cycle.\n- The maximum chromatic number for any cycle is 3.\n- Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of G is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.\nI believe I have sufficient information to answer the question now.\n\nI have established that the \"sum\" of graphs in this context most logically refers to the join of graphs. The search results consistently indicate that the chromatic number of the join of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers. I have also confirmed that the chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) is 2 if \\(n\\) is even and 3 if \\(n\\) is odd.\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of the join of three cycles, I need to maximize the chromatic number of each cycle. The maximum chromatic number for a single cycle is 3, which occurs when the cycle's length \\(n\\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, to achieve the maximal chromatic number for the graph \\(G\\), which is the sum (join) of three cycles, all three cycles must have an odd number of vertices. This leads to a total chromatic number of \\(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\).\n\nThe information gathered is sufficient and consistent, and no further searching is required. I can now formulate the final answer.\n\nThe notation \\(G\\) represents the join of three cycles of length \\(n\\). Let these cycles be \\(C_n\\), \\(C_n\\), and \\(C_n\\). The chromatic number of the join of graphs is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs. Therefore, \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n)\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\(C_n\\) depends on the parity of \\(n\\):\n- If \\(n\\) is even, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 2\\).\n- If \\(n\\) is odd, \\(\\chi(C_n) = 3\\).\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\), we must choose \\(n\\) such that \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) is maximized. The maximum value for \\(\\chi(C_n)\\) is 3, which is achieved when \\(n\\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is obtained when the three cycles are of odd length. In this case, the chromatic number is:\n\\(\\chi(G) = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\).\n\nFinal answer is 9.When considering a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\), the term \"sum\" in this context is typically interpreted as the join of the graphs. The join of graphs \\(G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\), denoted as \\(G_1 + G_2 + \\ldots + G_k\\), is a graph formed from the disjoint union of these graphs by adding all possible edges connecting vertices of different graphs.\n\nA key property of the join of graphs is that its chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs. For a graph \\(G\\) that is the join of three cycles of length \\(n\\), denoted as \\(C_n\\), the chromatic number of \\(G\\) is given by:\n\n\\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n)\\)\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph, \\(\\chi(C_n)\\), depends on the parity of its length \\(n\\):\n*   If \\(n\\) is an even number (\\(n \\ge 2\\)), the cycle is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\n*   If \\(n\\) is an odd number (\\(n \\ge 3\\)), the cycle is not bipartite, and its chromatic number is 3.\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\), we need to maximize the chromatic number of each individual cycle. The maximum chromatic number for a single cycle \\(C_n\\) is 3, which occurs when \\(n\\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, to achieve the maximal chromatic number for \\(G\\), the length \\(n\\) of the three cycles must be an odd number. In this case, the chromatic number of each cycle is 3.\n\nThe maximal chromatic number of the graph \\(G\\) is the sum of the maximal chromatic numbers of the three cycles:\n\n\\(\\chi(G)_{max} = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\)\n\n<<<9>>>"
