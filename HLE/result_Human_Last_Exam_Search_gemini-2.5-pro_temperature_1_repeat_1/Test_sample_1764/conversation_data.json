    "The problem asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nAn isometric embedding is a map $f: X \\to B$ such that for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d(x_1, x_2)$ holds, where $d$ is the metric on $X$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_B$ is the norm on $B$.\n\nThe phrase \"smallest possible number\" implies that we should find the minimum number of such embeddings by considering all possible valid choices for $X$ and $B$. Let's analyze the possibilities. The number of embeddings is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value it can take is 0. We need to determine if it is possible to find a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which there are zero isometric embeddings.\n\nConsider the following choices for $X$ and $B$:\n\n1.  **A simple case with a trivial Banach space:**\n    *   Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space with at least two distinct points, for example, $X = \\{a, b\\}$ with the metric $d(a, b) = 1$.\n    *   Let $B$ be the trivial Banach space $B = \\{0\\}$, which consists of only the zero vector. The norm is necessarily $\\|0\\| = 0$. This is a valid Banach space, and its cardinality is $K=1$.\n    *   An isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ must satisfy $\\|f(a) - f(b)\\|_B = d(a, b) = 1$.\n    *   However, since the only point in $B$ is 0, any map $f$ must have $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 0$.\n    *   This leads to $\\|f(a) - f(b)\\|_B = \\|0 - 0\\| = 0$.\n    *   Since $0 \\neq 1$, the condition for an isometric embedding is not met. No such embedding exists. In this case, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\n2.  **A case with a non-trivial Banach space:**\n    *   Let $X$ be the finite ultrametric space consisting of four points, $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$, with the metric defined as $d(x_i, x_j) = 1$ for $i \\neq j$, and $d(x_i, x_i) = 0$. This is a valid ultrametric space, as for any distinct $i,j,k$, the strong triangle inequality holds: $d(x_i, x_k) = 1 \\le \\max\\{d(x_i, x_j), d(x_j, x_k)\\} = \\max\\{1, 1\\}$.\n    *   Let $B$ be the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ equipped with the standard Euclidean norm, i.e., for a vector $v=(v_1, v_2)$, $\\|v\\| = \\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}$. The cardinality of this space is $K = c$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n    *   An isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ would require finding four distinct points in the Euclidean plane, $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$, such that the distance between any two distinct points is 1.\n    *   It is a well-known result in Euclidean geometry that it is impossible to have four points in a plane that are mutually equidistant. The maximum number of such points is three (the vertices of an equilateral triangle).\n    *   Therefore, no isometric embedding of this particular space $X$ into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ exists. The number of embeddings is 0.\n\nBoth examples demonstrate a scenario where the number of isometric embeddings is zero. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\nWhile it is true that for any finite ultrametric space, there *exists* a Banach space into which it can be isometrically embedded (for instance, a Hilbert space of sufficiently high dimension), the question asks for the smallest possible number across *all* possible Banach spaces, not just those that admit an embedding.\n\n<<<0>>>"
