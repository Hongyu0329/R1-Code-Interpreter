    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid and the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\n1.  **Dissolution Equilibrium:** The dissolution of aluminum hydroxide is represented by the reaction:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The solubility product constant (K_sp) is given by:\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Complex Formation Equilibrium:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The formation constant (K_f) is given by:\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\nThe total solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nWe can also consider the equilibrium for the formation of the complex ion directly from the solid:\nAl(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\nThe equilibrium constant (K) for this reaction can be found by combining K_sp and K_f:\nK = K_sp * K_f = ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]³) * ([Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴)) = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻]\nK = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\nTo find the solubility, we must determine the equilibrium concentrations of the species. The most rigorous method is to use the charge balance equation for the solution. The ions present in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\n**Charge Balance Equation:**\nThe total positive charge must equal the total negative charge:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nWe can express the concentration of each species in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻]:\n*   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷ / [OH⁻]³\n*   From K: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * [OH⁻]\n*   From the autoionization of water (K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴): [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / [OH⁻]\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n3(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷ / [OH⁻]³) + (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (5.83 x 10⁴)[OH⁻]\n\nLet x = [OH⁻].\n1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ / x³ + 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ / x = x(1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)\nMultiply the entire equation by x³ to eliminate the denominators:\n1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ + (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x² = (5.8301 x 10⁴)x⁴\n\nRearranging into a quadratic equation in terms of x²:\n(5.8301 x 10⁴)x⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)x² - 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nLet y = x² = [OH⁻]². Solving the quadratic equation for y:\ny = [ -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ] / 2a\nWhere a = 5.8301 x 10⁴, b = -1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴, and c = -1.59 x 10⁻²⁶.\ny = [ 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± √((-1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.8301 x 10⁴)(-1.59 x 10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 * 5.8301 x 10⁴)\ny = [ 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± √(1.0 x 10⁻²⁸ + 3.705 x 10⁻²¹) ] / 1.16602 x 10⁵\n\nThe term 1.0 x 10⁻²⁸ is negligible compared to 3.705 x 10⁻²¹.\ny ≈ [ 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± √(3.705 x 10⁻²¹) ] / 1.16602 x 10⁵\ny ≈ [ 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.087 x 10⁻¹¹ ] / 1.16602 x 10⁵\n\nSince y = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\ny ≈ 6.087 x 10⁻¹¹ / 1.16602 x 10⁵ ≈ 5.219 x 10⁻¹⁶ M²\n[OH⁻] = √y ≈ √(5.219 x 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nNow we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and find the total solubility:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷ / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\n\nThe total solubility S is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M + 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\nS = 0.444 x 10⁻³ M + 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\nS = 1.774 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\nS ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
