    "A self-avoiding walk on a lattice is a path from one point to another that does not visit the same point more than once. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" refers to a square grid, representing the street layout of Manhattan.\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, the number of possible walks, denoted as a(10), has been calculated to be 44,100. The number of self-avoiding walks is a sequence that grows rapidly with the number of steps. For instance, the number of walks for the first few steps are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n\nCalculating these values is computationally intensive and there is no known simple formula to determine a(n) for any given n.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
