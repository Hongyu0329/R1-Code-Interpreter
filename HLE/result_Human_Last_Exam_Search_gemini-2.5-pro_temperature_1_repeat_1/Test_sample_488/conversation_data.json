    "According to the theory of conceptual metaphor, primarily developed by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, abstract concepts are often understood and talked about in terms of more concrete concepts. They identify three main types of conceptual metaphors: orientational, ontological, and structural.\n\n1.  **Orientational Metaphors** structure concepts based on spatial relationships like up-down, in-out, or front-back (e.g., \"I'm feeling *up* today\" from the HAPPY IS UP metaphor).\n2.  **Ontological Metaphors** involve understanding abstract experiences or ideas as if they were concrete objects or substances (e.g., \"combating inflation,\" which treats inflation as an entity).\n3.  **Structural Metaphors** are cases where one complex, abstract concept is metaphorically structured in terms of another, often more concrete, concept (e.g., ARGUMENT IS WAR or LOVE IS A JOURNEY). This allows us to use the structure of the source concept (war, a journey) to understand the target concept (argument, love).\n\nThe phrase \"my love for humanity\" treats the abstract emotion of 'love' as something that can be possessed (\"my love\") and directed toward a target (\"for humanity\"). This imposes a structure on the concept of love, conceptualizing it as a type of possession or a directed force. This structuring of one concept (love) in terms of another (a possession, a force) is the defining characteristic of a structural metaphor.\n\nWhile it has elements of an ontological metaphor (treating love as a \"thing\"), the primary function here is to structure the complex and abstract concept of love, which aligns most closely with the definition of a structural metaphor.\n\nTherefore, the kind of conceptual metaphor expressed is a structural metaphor.\n\n<<<D>>>"
