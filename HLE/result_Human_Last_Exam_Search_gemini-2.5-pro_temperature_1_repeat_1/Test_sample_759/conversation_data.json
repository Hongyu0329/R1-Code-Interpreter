    "To determine the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of order 3, we need to consider the properties of such a graph.\n\n### Properties of a Graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3`\n\n1.  **Group Structure**: The automorphism group being of order 3 means it is isomorphic to the cyclic group `C₃`. This group consists of the identity and two automorphisms, `φ` and `φ²`, where `φ` has order 3 (`φ³ = id`).\n2.  **Vertex Orbits**: An automorphism permutes the vertices of the graph. The automorphism `φ` of order 3 must partition the vertex set `V` into disjoint orbits of size 3 (3-cycles) and orbits of size 1 (fixed points).\n3.  **Connectivity and Fixed Points**: If the graph is connected, it cannot consist solely of fixed points. Therefore, there must be at least one orbit of size 3.\n4.  **Edge Orbits**: The automorphism `φ` also acts on the set of edges. Since `φ` has order 3, the edge set is partitioned into orbits of size 3 and fixed edges. An edge is fixed if it connects two fixed points (since `φ` has no 2-cycles).\n5.  **Number of Edges**: If there are no fixed points, then all vertices are in 3-cycles. The number of vertices `n` must be a multiple of 3. Consequently, there are no fixed edges, and the number of edges `e` must also be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Finding the Smallest Graph\n\nFirst, let's establish the minimum number of vertices required. It is a known result from graph theory that the minimum number of vertices for a graph `γ` with `Aut(γ) ≅ C₃` is 9. Let's call this minimum number `α(C₃) = 9`.\n\nSince the graph must be connected and have 9 vertices, it must have at least `n-1 = 9-1 = 8` edges.\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of edges `e`.\n\n*   **Case 1: The graph has no fixed points under `φ`**. In this case, `e` must be a multiple of 3. Given that `e ≥ 8`, the smallest possible value for `e` is 9.\n*   **Case 2: The graph has fixed points under `φ`**. The number of edges does not have to be a multiple of 3, so `e=8` might be possible.\n\nLet's try to construct a graph for each case.\n\n#### Construction Attempt for `e=8` (Case 2)\n\nFor `e=8`, there must be fixed points and at least one fixed edge. Let's try to construct a graph with `n=9` and `e=8`. A graph with 9 vertices and 8 edges is a tree if connected.\nLet's try to construct a graph with a \"tail\" of fixed vertices attached to a 3-cycle of vertices in a way that breaks symmetries.\n\nConsider a set of six fixed vertices `c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄, c₅, c₆` and an orbit of three vertices `v₁, v₂, v₃`. Let the automorphism `φ` be the cycle `(v₁ v₂ v₃)`. For this to be an automorphism, the structure of connections to `{v₁, v₂, v₃}` must be symmetric.\nTo break unwanted reflectional symmetries, the subgraph of fixed points must be asymmetric. Let's try making the fixed vertices form a tree that is asymmetric when rooted at the attachment point.\n\nLet's try a specific construction:\n*   **Vertices**: `c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄, c₅, c₆` and `v₁, v₂, v₃`.\n*   **Fixed Subgraph (5 edges)**: Create an asymmetric tree on the `c` vertices, for example, a path `c₁-c₂-c₃-c₄-c₅` with another vertex `c₆` attached to `c₂`, i.e., `c₂-c₆`. This is a tree with 6 vertices and 5 edges. Let's root it at `c₁`.\n*   **Connecting Edges (3 edges)**: To maintain the 3-fold symmetry on the `v` vertices, connect `c₁` to each of `v₁, v₂, v₃`.\n*   This graph `γ₈` has `n=9` vertices and `e = 5 + 3 = 8` edges. It is connected.\n\nNow, let's analyze `|Aut(γ₈)|`.\n*   **Degrees**: `deg(vᵢ)=1`, `deg(c₁)=4`, `deg(c₂)=3`, `deg(c₃)=2`, `deg(c₄)=2`, `deg(c₅)=1`, `deg(c₆)=1`.\n*   An automorphism must map vertices to vertices of the same degree.\n*   The set of degree-1 vertices is `{v₁, v₂, v₃, c₅, c₆}`. Let's distinguish them by their neighbors' degrees.\n    *   `N(vᵢ) = {c₁}` (degree 4).\n    *   `N(c₅) = {c₄}` (degree 2).\n    *   `N(c₆) = {c₂}` (degree 3).\n*   Since the neighbors have different degrees, an automorphism must map `{v₁, v₂, v₃}` to itself, `c₅` to `c₅`, and `c₆` to `c₆`.\n*   The fixed points `c₅` and `c₆` force their neighbors `c₄` and `c₂` to be fixed. This chain reaction fixes all `c` vertices.\n*   So, any automorphism `ψ` must fix all `cᵢ` vertices and can only permute `{v₁, v₂, v₃}`.\n*   Any permutation of `{v₁, v₂, v₃}` is an automorphism because they are all connected to the same fixed vertex `c₁`.\n*   Thus, the automorphism group is `S₃`, with `|S₃| = 6`. This construction fails.\n\nAny attempt to use fixed points seems to result in a larger automorphism group because the fixed part provides a symmetric anchor for the permuted vertices.\n\n#### Construction for `e=9` (Case 1)\n\nSince `e=8` appears not to work, let's try to construct a graph with `e=9`. As `e` is a multiple of 3, we can try to build a graph with no fixed points.\nThe 9 vertices must be in three 3-cycles. Let them be `V = {v₁,v₂,v₃} ∪ {u₁,u₂,u₃} ∪ {w₁,w₂,w₃}`.\nThe automorphism `φ` is `(v₁v₂v₃)(u₁u₂u₃)(w₁w₂w₃)`.\nTo have `|Aut(γ)|=3`, we need to add edges in orbits of 3 that break reflectional symmetries.\n\nConsider the following graph `γ₉`:\n*   **Vertices**: `V = {v₁,v₂,v₃} ∪ {u₁,u₂,u₃} ∪ {w₁,w₂,w₃}` (`n=9`).\n*   **Edges (e=9)**:\n    1.  An orbit connecting `v`'s to `u`'s: `(v₁,u₁), (v₂,u₂), (v₃,u₃)`.\n    2.  An orbit connecting `u`'s to `w`'s: `(u₁,w₁), (u₂,w₂), (u₃,w₃)`.\n    3.  A \"chiral\" orbit connecting `u`'s and `w`'s: `(u₁,w₂), (u₂,w₃), (u₃,w₁)`.\n\nLet's analyze `γ₉`:\n*   **Connectivity**: The path `v₁-u₁-w₂-u₂-v₂` connects `v₁` and `v₂`. Due to symmetry, the graph is connected.\n*   **Degrees**:\n    *   `deg(vᵢ) = 1`.\n    *   `deg(uᵢ) = 3` (connected to one `v`, one `w` with the same index, and one `w` with a different index).\n    *   `deg(wᵢ) = 2` (connected to one `u` with the same index and one `u` with a different index).\n*   **Automorphism Group**:\n    *   An automorphism must preserve the degree partitions, so it maps `{vᵢ}` to `{vᵢ}`, `{uᵢ}` to `{uᵢ}`, and `{wᵢ}` to `{wᵢ}`.\n    *   Adjacency `(vᵢ, uᵢ)` implies that a permutation of `{vᵢ}` determines the permutation of `{uᵢ}`.\n    *   By construction, the 3-cycle `φ` is an automorphism. So `|Aut(γ₉)| ≥ 3`.\n    *   Let's test a reflection, for example `τ = (v₁v₃)(u₁u₃)(w₁w₃)`. This would be an automorphism in `S₃` but not in `C₃`.\n    *   Consider the edge `(u₁,w₂)`. Its image under `τ` is `(τ(u₁),τ(w₂)) = (u₃,w₂)`.\n    *   However, `(u₃,w₂)` is not an edge in our graph `γ₉` (the edges are `(u₁,w₂), (u₂,w₃), (u₃,w₁)`) .\n    *   Since the adjacency is not preserved, `τ` is not an automorphism. The same logic applies to all other reflections.\n\nTherefore, the only automorphisms are the identity, `φ`, and `φ²`. The group is `C₃` and its order is 3.\n\nWe have found a simple, connected graph with 9 edges and `|Aut(γ)| = 3`. Since `n_min = 9`, the minimum number of edges is at least 8. We showed `e=8` is not a multiple of 3, likely requiring fixed points which proved difficult to configure correctly. `e=9` is the next possibility and a working example was found.\n\nThus, the smallest number of edges `e` is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
