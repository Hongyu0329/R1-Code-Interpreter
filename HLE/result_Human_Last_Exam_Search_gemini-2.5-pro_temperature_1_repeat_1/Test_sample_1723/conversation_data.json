    "Based on available mycological information, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile some mushrooms have blue coloring on their caps or stems, or bruise blue when handled, their spore prints are different colors. For instance, the Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*), a mushroom known for its striking blue color and blue \"milk,\" actually has a cream to pale yellowish spore print.\n\nOther mushrooms that are blue in appearance, such as the Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*), have a purple-black spore print. Similarly, the blue-staining *Panaeolus cyanescens* has a black spore print. The color of a mushroom's spores, when viewed as a mass in a spore print, is a critical characteristic for identification and typically ranges from white and cream to brown, purple, and black. A green spore print is a known characteristic of the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, but a blue spore print has not been documented.\n\nTherefore, the premise of a mushroom genus with a distinctly blue spore print is incorrect.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
