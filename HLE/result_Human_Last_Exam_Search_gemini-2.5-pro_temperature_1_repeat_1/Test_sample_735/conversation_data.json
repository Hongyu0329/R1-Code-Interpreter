    "A total of **21** finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nResearch by Anabanti, Hart, and Lytle culminated in a complete classification of finite groups that possess maximal by inclusion (also known as locally maximal) product-free sets of size 3. Their work confirmed that any such group must have an order of 24 or less.\n\nThe definitive list of these groups is provided in a comprehensive table, which enumerates the groups and the corresponding product-free sets. The 21 finite groups are:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C\n<font size=\"2\">6</font>, C<font size=\"2\">7</font>, C<font size=\"2\">8</font>, C<font size=\"2\">9</font>, C<font size=\"2\">10</font>, C<font size=\"2\">12</font>, C<font size=\"2\">14</font>, C<font size=\"2\">15</font>, C<font size=\"2\">16</font>, C<font size=\"2\">18</font>, C<font size=\"2\">20</font>, C<font size=\"2\">22</font>, and C<font size=\"2\">24</font>.\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** D<font size=\"2\">8</font>, D<font size=\"2\">10</font>, D<font size=\"2\">12</font>, D<font size=\"2\">16</font>, and D<font size=\"2\">18</font>.\n*   **Other Groups:**\n    *   The alternating group A<font size=\"2\">4</font>.\n    *   The special linear group SL(2,3).\n    *   The group `SmallGroup(24,3)`, which is the direct product of the quaternion group Q<font size=\"2\">8</font> and the cyclic group C<font size=\"2\">3</font>.\n\nThis classification is considered complete, meaning no other finite groups have this property.\n\n<<<21>>>"
