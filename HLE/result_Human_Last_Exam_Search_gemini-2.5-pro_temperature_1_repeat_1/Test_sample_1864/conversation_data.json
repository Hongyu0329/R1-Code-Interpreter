    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, you should prepare a minimum of **12 essential control samples**.\n\nThese controls are crucial for setting up the cytometer correctly, ensuring accurate data interpretation, and for the precise gating required for cell sorting. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls and their purpose:\n\n### 1. Unstained Control (1 Sample)\nThis sample contains only the cells and/or beads without any fluorescent labels.\n*   **Purpose:** To determine the baseline level of background fluorescence (autofluorescence) from your cells or beads and to set the initial voltage settings for the detectors (PMTs).\n\n### 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 Samples)\nFor a five-color experiment, you need a separate control sample for each fluorophore.\n*   **Purpose:** To correct for spectral overlap, which is the signal from one fluorophore \"spilling\" into the detector for another. The software uses these single-stained samples to perform a mathematical correction called compensation.\n*   **Samples:**\n    1.  AF350 only\n    2.  GFP only\n    3.  PE only\n    4.  AF647 only\n    5.  AF750 only\n\n### 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 Samples)\nFMO controls are critical in multicolor experiments for accurate gating. Each FMO control contains all the fluorophores in your panel, except for one.\n*   **Purpose:** To identify the spread of fluorescence from all other stains into the channel of the omitted fluorophore. This allows you to set precise gates that distinguish between truly positive and negative populations, which is vital for sorting.\n*   **Samples:**\n    1.  All stains minus AF350\n    2.  All stains minus GFP\n    3.  All stains minus PE\n    4.  All stains minus AF647\n    5.  All stains minus AF750\n\n### 4. Streptavidin Bead-Specific Control (1 Sample)\nWhen using an indirect detection method like biotin-streptavidin, it's important to have a control for non-specific binding of the detection reagent.\n*   **Purpose:** To ensure that the fluorescently-labeled streptavidin is not binding non-specifically to the beads or cells. This sample should contain the streptavidin beads and the fluorescent streptavidin conjugate but omit the biotinylated antibody or molecule you are trying to detect.\n\n### Additional Essential Considerations:\n*   **Viability Dye:** It is essential to include a viability dye in your fully stained sample to exclude dead cells. Dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence, leading to false positives. The viability dye will be one of the fluorophores in your panel, and its corresponding single-stain compensation control is already accounted for in the five compensation controls.\n*   **Biological Controls:** While the 12 controls listed above are for instrument setup and gating, you should also include biological controls. These would be samples that are known to be positive or negative for your markers of interest, which help to validate that the staining is working as expected.\n\nIn summary, for proper setup and accurate sorting in this five-color experiment, you will need to prepare **1 unstained control + 5 compensation controls + 5 FMO controls + 1 bead-specific control**.\n\n<<<12>>>"
