    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single, fixed value. It depends on the specific atom being considered. The total number for a molecule is the sum of the primitives for each of its atoms.\n\nTo understand the number of primitives, the notation \"6-311G**\" must be broken down:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This describes a \"split-valence, triple-zeta\" basis set.\n    *   **6**: The core orbitals (like the 1s orbital in Carbon) are described by a single basis function, which is a linear combination (a contraction) of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals are split into three basis functions each. For each valence atomic orbital, one basis function is a contraction of **3** primitive Gaussians, the second is a single primitive Gaussian, and the third is also a single primitive Gaussian.\n*   **\\*\\***: This indicates the addition of polarization functions. It is equivalent to the notation \"(d,p)\".\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of **d-type polarization functions** to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n    *   The second asterisk (`**`) adds a set of **p-type polarization functions** to hydrogen atoms. These polarization functions are typically single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n\nHere is the calculation for representative atoms:\n\n### **Hydrogen (H)**\n\nA hydrogen atom has one valence 1s orbital and no core orbitals.\n\n*   **Valence 1s orbital (from \"311\")**: The orbital is described by three functions composed of 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians, respectively.\n    *   Total for the s-orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (from \"\\*\\*\")**: A set of p-functions (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂) is added. Each is a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Total for polarization: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 primitive Gaussians.\n\n**Total for Hydrogen: 5 + 3 = 8 primitive Gaussians.**\n\n### **Second-Row Heavy Atoms (e.g., Carbon, C)**\n\nA second-row heavy atom has a 1s core orbital and 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n\n*   **Core 1s orbital (from \"6\")**: This is a single function made from a contraction of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence 2s and 2p orbitals (from \"311\")**: Carbon has one 2s and three 2p valence orbitals. The description applies to each.\n    *   For the 2s orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   For each of the three 2p orbitals: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians. Total for 2p orbitals is 3 × 5 = 15 primitives.\n    *   Total for valence orbitals: 5 (for 2s) + 15 (for 2p) = 20 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (from \"\\*\")**: A set of d-type functions is added. The number of primitives here depends on whether 5 \"pure\" (spherical) or 6 \"Cartesian\" d-functions are used, a choice available in computational chemistry software.\n    *   Using 5d spherical functions adds **5** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   Using 6d Cartesian functions adds **6** primitive Gaussians.\n\n**Total for Carbon:**\n*   With **5d (spherical)** polarization: 6 (core) + 20 (valence) + 5 (polarization) = **31 primitive Gaussians**.\n*   With **6d (Cartesian)** polarization: 6 (core) + 20 (valence) + 6 (polarization) = **32 primitive Gaussians**.\n\nFor example, to calculate the number of primitives for methane (CH₄) using 6d functions, you would sum the primitives for one carbon and four hydrogens: 32 + (4 × 8) = 64 primitive Gaussians. Using 5d functions, the total would be 31 + (4 × 8) = 63 primitive Gaussians. The choice between spherical and Cartesian functions can depend on the software and specific keywords used.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom. For Hydrogen, it is 8. For a second-row heavy atom like Carbon, it is 31 if using 5d (spherical) polarization functions or 32 if using 6d (Cartesian) polarization functions.>>>"
