    "The pattern in the sequence is as follows:\n\nLet the sequence be denoted by a(n).\nThe first term is a(1) = 2.\nThe subsequent terms are generated by the formula:\na(n) = 3 * a(n-1) - (2^n + 2) for n ≥ 3.\nThe second term has a special rule.\n\nLet's verify this pattern with the given numbers:\n*   **a(1) = 2**\n*   **a(2) = 11**\n    *   This is calculated as 3 * a(1) + 5 = 3 * 2 + 5 = 11.\n*   **a(3) = 23**\n    *   Using the formula for n=3: 3 * a(2) - (2³ + 2) = 3 * 11 - (8 + 2) = 33 - 10 = 23.\n*   **a(4) = 51**\n    *   Using the formula for n=4: 3 * a(3) - (2⁴ + 2) = 3 * 23 - (16 + 2) = 69 - 18 = 51.\n*   **a(5) = 119**\n    *   Using the formula for n=5: 3 * a(4) - (2⁵ + 2) = 3 * 51 - (32 + 2) = 153 - 34 = 119.\n\nThe pattern holds true for all the given terms. Now, we apply this pattern to find the next term in the sequence, which is a(6).\n\n*   **a(6) = ?**\n    *   Using the formula for n=6: 3 * a(5) - (2⁶ + 2) = 3 * 119 - (64 + 2) = 357 - 66 = 291.\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
