    "To determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with a 6-31G** basis set, a systematic approach is required. This involves determining the total number of electrons, the total spin, and the total number of basis functions (which corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals in a full CI calculation).\n\nFirst, the total number of electrons (N) in the molecule is calculated by summing the atomic numbers of its constituent atoms:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron per atom (x2) = 2 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nThe total number of electrons is N = 6 + 2 + 14 + 9 = 31. Since there is an odd number of electrons, the molecule is a doublet, and its total spin (S) is 1/2.\n\nNext, the number of basis functions (K) for the 6-31G** basis set is determined. The `**` notation is equivalent to 6-31G(d,p), which means that d-type polarization functions are added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions are added to hydrogen atoms. The number of basis functions for each atom is as follows:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2s (from 6-31G) + 3p (from `**`) = 5 basis functions. For two hydrogen atoms, this totals 10 basis functions.\n*   **Carbon (C):** 9 basis functions (from 6-31G) + 6 d-functions (from `*`) = 15 basis functions.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** 9 basis functions (from 6-31G) + 6 d-functions (from `*`) = 15 basis functions.\n*   **Silicon (Si):** 13 basis functions (from 6-31G for a third-row element) + 6 d-functions (from `*`) = 19 basis functions.\n\nThe total number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, K) is K = 15 (C) + 10 (2H) + 19 (Si) + 15 (F) = 59.\n\nThe number of CSFs for a full CI calculation is calculated using Weyl's formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{\\frac{N}{2}-S} \\binom{K+1}{\\frac{N}{2}+S+1} $$\n\nSubstituting the values N=31, K=59, and S=1/2 into the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\frac{2(\\frac{1}{2})+1}{59+1} \\binom{59+1}{\\frac{31}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}} \\binom{59+1}{\\frac{31}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}+1} $$\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\frac{2}{60} \\binom{60}{15} \\binom{60}{17} $$\n\nThe calculation of the binomial coefficients results in an exceedingly large number:\n$$ \\binom{60}{15} = 2,243,733,363,337,800 $$\n$$ \\binom{60}{17} = 1,961,339,033,790,400 $$\n\nThus, the number of CSFs is:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\frac{1}{30} \\times (2.2437 \\times 10^{15}) \\times (1.9613 \\times 10^{15}) \\approx 1.465 \\times 10^{29} $$\n\nThis extraordinarily large number highlights why full CI calculations are only feasible for very small molecules and basis sets.\n\n<<<1.465 x 10<sup>29</sup>>>>"
