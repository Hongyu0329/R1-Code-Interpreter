In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, \(G_0\), has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, \(\epsilon_k\), in the form of a simple pole. In frequency-momentum space, this is typically expressed as \(G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta}\) (or a slightly more detailed form depending on the context), where the pole in the complex frequency (\(\omega\)) plane is located at the single-particle energy \(\epsilon_k\).
