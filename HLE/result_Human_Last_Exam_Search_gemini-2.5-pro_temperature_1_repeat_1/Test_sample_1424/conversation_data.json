    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, also known as the non-interacting Green's function, describes the propagation of a single particle in a system without interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, \\( \\epsilon_k \\), is fundamental to understanding the behavior of the system before interactions are taken into account.\n\nThe bare Green's function, denoted as \\( G_0 \\), can be expressed in various representations, most commonly in the time domain, \\( G_0(k, t-t') \\), or in the frequency domain, \\( G_0(k, \\omega) \\), after a Fourier transform. The relationship is most transparent in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\nFor a non-interacting system, the Hamiltonian \\( H_0 \\) is diagonal in the basis of single-particle states, with the energy eigenvalues \\( \\epsilon_k \\), where *k* represents the quantum numbers of the single-particle state (e.g., momentum).\n\nThe bare Green's function in frequency space for a given momentum *k* and frequency \\( \\omega \\) is given by:\n\n**For fermions:**\n\n\\( G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)} \\)\n\nwhere:\n*   \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency.\n*   \\( \\epsilon_k \\) is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state with momentum *k*.\n*   \\( \\mu \\) is the chemical potential. The term \\( \\epsilon_k - \\mu \\) represents the energy of the single-particle state relative to the Fermi level.\n*   \\( \\eta \\) is a positive infinitesimal, which ensures the correct causal behavior of the Green's function. The sign function, sgn, determines whether the pole in the complex frequency plane is slightly above or below the real axis.\n\nAlternatively, and more commonly, the expression is written as:\n\n\\( G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1 - n_k}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta} + \\frac{n_k}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\eta} \\)\n\nHere, \\( n_k \\) is the occupation number of the single-particle state with energy \\( \\epsilon_k \\) in the ground state. For fermions at zero temperature, \\( n_k = 1 \\) if \\( \\epsilon_k < \\mu \\) and \\( n_k = 0 \\) if \\( \\epsilon_k > \\mu \\).\n\n**For bosons:**\n\nThe expression is similar, but without the constraints of the Pauli exclusion principle on the occupation numbers.\n\nFrom these expressions, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function \\( G_0 \\) on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \\( \\epsilon_k \\) is clearly that of a **simple pole**. The pole of \\( G_0(k, \\omega) \\) in the complex \\( \\omega \\)-plane occurs precisely at the single-particle energy \\( \\epsilon_k \\).\n\nIn summary, the bare Green's function \\( G_0 \\) has a direct and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues \\( \\epsilon_k \\) by exhibiting a singularity (a simple pole) at these energy values in the frequency domain. This pole structure dictates the propagation characteristics of a non-interacting particle with that specific energy.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, \\(G_0\\), has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, \\(\\epsilon_k\\), in the form of a simple pole. In frequency-momentum space, this is typically expressed as \\(G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}\\) (or a slightly more detailed form depending on the context), where the pole in the complex frequency (\\(\\omega\\)) plane is located at the single-particle energy \\(\\epsilon_k\\).>>>"
