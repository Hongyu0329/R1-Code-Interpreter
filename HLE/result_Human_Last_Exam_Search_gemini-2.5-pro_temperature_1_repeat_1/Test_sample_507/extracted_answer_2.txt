Korean and Tamil are two languages from distinct Asian cultures where the words for "mom" and "dad" are nearly identical, though the word for "broom" is not. The languages are Korean (from the Koreanic family in East Asia) and Tamil (from the Dravidian family in South Asia). The informal word for mother is "eomma" (엄마) in Korean and "amma" (அம்மா) in Tamil. The word for father is "appa" (아빠) in Korean and "appa" (அப்பா) in Tamil. The words for broom, however, are different: "bi" (비) in Korean and "thudaippam" (துடைப்பம்) in Tamil. These cultures are geographically distant and linguistically unrelated, and the reasons for the similarities in vocabulary are a subject of debate among historians and linguists.
