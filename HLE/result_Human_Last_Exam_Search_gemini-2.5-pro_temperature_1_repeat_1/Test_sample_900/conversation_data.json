    "I am unable to determine the exact number of pas de Balanchine performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo scene from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\"\n\nWhile it is confirmed that Svetlana Gileva performed this role with the Semperoper Ballett during that time, a video of this specific performance is not publicly available for analysis. The official videos from the Semperoper Ballett are currently inaccessible. Without a visual record of the choreography as performed by Ms. Gileva in that production, it is impossible to provide an accurate count of the specific ballet step.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question.>>>"
