    "### Equilibrium State of Photon Gas Determined by Large Deviation Principles\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) can be determined using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a framework for understanding the statistical behavior of systems and identifying their most probable, or equilibrium, state.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state of an isolated system is the macroscopic configuration that corresponds to the maximum number of microscopic arrangements. This is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy. Large deviation theory offers a probabilistic foundation for this principle. Sanov's theorem, in particular, relates the probability of observing a macroscopic state to its relative entropy with respect to the underlying microscopic dynamics. The most probable macroscopic state—the one we observe at equilibrium—is the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function, which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy.\n\nFor a gas of photons, which are indistinguishable bosons, we consider the distribution of these particles among various discrete energy levels, \\( \\epsilon_i \\). The number of photons is not conserved, meaning particles can be created and destroyed, which results in a chemical potential of zero for the photon gas. The system is constrained only by its total average energy.\n\nFollowing the large deviation approach, the entropy of the system, which is analogous to the negative of the rate function, is maximized under the constraint of a fixed mean energy. This procedure yields the most probable distribution of particles among the energy levels.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute \\(n_i\\) indistinguishable particles (photons) into \\(g_i\\) states at energy level \\( \\epsilon_i \\) is given by:\n\\( W_i = \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!} \\)\n\nThe total entropy of the system is the sum of the entropies for each energy level, given by the Boltzmann formula, \\( S = k_B \\ln W \\), where \\( W = \\prod_i W_i \\). Using Stirling's approximation for large numbers, the entropy can be written as:\n\\( S = k_B \\sum_i [ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i ] \\)\n\nTo find the equilibrium distribution, we maximize this entropy subject to the constraint that the total mean energy \\( \\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i \\) is constant. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we introduce a multiplier \\( \\beta \\) for the energy constraint. The maximization condition leads to the equilibrium occupation number \\( \\langle n_i \\rangle \\) for the energy level \\( \\epsilon_i \\).\n\nThis optimization directly yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons:\n\\( \\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{g_i}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1} \\)\nwhere \\( \\beta = 1/(k_B T) \\) and \\( T \\) is the equilibrium temperature.\n\nWith the equilibrium distribution determined, we can express the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of the photon gas.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\nThe mean energy \\( \\langle E \\rangle \\) is found by summing the energy of all photons, using the equilibrium distribution. For a continuous spectrum of energy states, the sum is replaced by an integral over the density of states \\( g(\\epsilon) \\):\n\\( \\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon g(\\epsilon)}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon \\)\n\nFor photons in a three-dimensional cavity of volume \\( V \\), the density of states (including two polarization states) is \\( g(\\epsilon) = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 \\). Substituting this into the energy formula gives:\n\\( \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (h c)^3} \\)\nThis is the well-known Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\nThe equilibrium entropy \\( S \\) can be calculated by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers \\( \\langle n_i \\rangle \\) back into the entropy formula. For a continuous spectrum, this becomes:\n\\( S = \\frac{k_B}{V} \\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\left[ \\frac{\\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle}{g(\\epsilon)} \\ln \\left(1 + \\frac{g(\\epsilon)}{\\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle} \\right) + \\ln \\left(1 + \\frac{\\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle}{g(\\epsilon)} \\right) \\right] d\\epsilon \\)\n\nUsing the Bose-Einstein distribution, this simplifies to:\n\\( S = k_B \\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\left[ \\frac{\\beta \\epsilon}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} - \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) \\right] d\\epsilon \\)\n\nSubstituting the density of states for photons and evaluating the integral leads to:\n\\( S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B V}{45} \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{h c} \\right)^3 \\)\n\nIn summary, the large deviation theorems provide a formal justification for the principle of maximum entropy in statistical mechanics. By applying this principle to a gas of photons, we derive the Bose-Einstein distribution as the equilibrium state and, from it, the established thermodynamic expressions for mean energy and entropy.\n\n<<<The equilibrium mean energy for a photon gas is given by \\( \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (h c)^3} \\), and the equilibrium entropy is \\( S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B V}{45} \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{h c} \\right)^3 \\).>>>"
