    "The parametric curve is defined in two parts.\n\nFor the interval $t\\in[0,\\pi]$, the equations are $x=\\cos t$ and $y=\\sin t$. This represents the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin. The x-values range from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$, and the y-values range from $\\sin(0)=0$ to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$.\n\nFor the interval $t\\in(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the equations are $x=\\cos t$ and $y=5\\sin t$. This corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin. The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$. The y-values are given by $5\\sin t$. Since $\\sin t$ is in the range $(-1, 0)$ for this interval of t, the y-values range from $5 \\times (-1) = -5$ to $5 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\nTo find the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we need to determine the overall minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.\n*   **Maximum x-value:** 1 (from the first part at t=0 and the second part as t approaches 2π)\n*   **Minimum x-value:** -1 (from both parts at t=π)\n*   **Maximum y-value:** 1 (from the first part at t=π/2)\n*   **Minimum y-value:** -5 (from the second part at t=3π/2)\n\nThe total width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values: $1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe total height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values: $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe side length of the smallest square that can enclose the figure must be equal to the larger of these two dimensions. The larger dimension is the height, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the area of the smallest circumscribing square is the side length squared:\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
