    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the large $x$ regime, we first analyze the equation:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large values of $x$, we look for the dominant terms that dictate the behavior of the solution.\nThe term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ tends to zero as $x \\to \\infty$, provided that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$.\nThe term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is a bounded, oscillating function with singularities. Its presence makes finding an exact solution difficult. For an approximate analysis of the underlying behavior, we can consider the equation without the smaller or more complex terms. Let's analyze the autonomous part of the equation, which is likely to govern the primary behavior of the solution, especially if the solution's magnitude becomes large.\n$y''' \\approx y^4 + y'^4$\n\nWe search for a solution of the form $y(x) = c x^n$.\nThe derivatives are $y'(x) = cnx^{n-1}$, $y''(x) = cn(n-1)x^{n-2}$, and $y'''(x) = cn(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3}$.\nSubstituting these into the approximated ODE gives:\n$cn(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3} \\approx (cx^n)^4 + (cnx^{n-1})^4 = c^4x^{4n} + c^4n^4x^{4n-4}$\n\nTo find a balance between the terms for large $x$, we compare the powers of $x$. The term $c^4x^{4n}$ will dominate the right-hand side over the term $c^4n^4x^{4n-4}$. Thus, the dominant balance is between the $y'''$ term and the $y^4$ term.\n$y''' \\approx y^4$\n\nEquating the powers of $x$:\n$n-3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$.\n\nNow, we solve for the coefficient $c$ by equating the coefficients of the dominant terms:\n$c(n)(n-1)(n-2) = c^4$\nWith $n=-1$, this becomes:\n$c(-1)(-1-1)(-1-2) = c^4$\n$c(-1)(-2)(-3) = c^4$\n$-6c = c^4$\n$c^4 + 6c = 0$\n$c(c^3 + 6) = 0$\n\nThis gives two possible solutions. One is $c=0$, which corresponds to the trivial solution $y(x)=0$. The other is $c^3 = -6$, which gives $c = -\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nThis provides a possible asymptotic solution for large $x$:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\sqrt{6} x^{-1}$\n\nThe initial conditions are given at $x=0$. Asymptotic solutions for large $x$ are not expected to satisfy initial conditions at $x=0$. The initial conditions determine the specific trajectory of the solution, which may or may not approach this particular asymptotic behavior. However, other potential behaviors, such as solutions that grow with $x$ or experience a finite-time blow-up, are inconsistent with the requirement of a solution in the \"large $x$ regime\" (implying $x \\to \\infty$). The analysis of the full equation including the term $1/(\\tan(x)+1)$ shows that no simple solution exists for $x \\to \\infty$. The identified decaying solution is the only plausible candidate for an asymptotic behavior under the simplifying assumption that the core autonomous dynamics dominate.\n\nWe now calculate the numerical value of the coefficient:\n$c = -\\sqrt{6} \\approx -1.81712$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $c \\approx -1.82$.\nThus, the analytical expression that approximates the solution for large $x$ is:\n$y(x) \\approx -1.82 x^{-1}$\n\n<<<$-1.82 x^{-1}$>>>"
