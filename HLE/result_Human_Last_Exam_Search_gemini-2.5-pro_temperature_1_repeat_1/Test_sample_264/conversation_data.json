    "To determine the volume of the intersection of two cubes, each with a side length of 1, shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the First Cube:** Let the first cube (C1) be represented by the set of points (x, y, z) in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n\n2.  **Understand the Shift:** The main diagonal of this cube connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1). A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is interpreted as a displacement by a vector where each coordinate is shifted by 1/2. Thus, the shift vector is (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n3.  **Define the Second Cube:** The second cube (C2) is the first cube translated by this vector. To find the coordinates of C2, we add the shift vector to the coordinate ranges of C1:\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n4.  **Calculate the Intersection:** The intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for both C1 and C2. For axis-aligned cubes, we can find the intersection by finding the overlap along each axis independently.\n    *   **X-axis:** The intersection of the intervals and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this overlapping interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n    *   **Y-axis:** The intersection of the intervals and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this overlapping interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n    *   **Z-axis:** The intersection of the intervals and [1/2, 3/2] is [1/2, 1]. The length of this overlapping interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\n5.  **Determine the Volume of the Intersection:** The resulting intersection is a smaller cube whose sides are the overlapping intervals. The volume of this intersection is the product of the lengths of these sides.\n\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
