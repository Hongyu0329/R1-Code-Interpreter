    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclic reaction of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which are encapsulated in the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Reaction Type\nThe reaction is a thermal electrocyclic ring closure. The reactant, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, is a conjugated polyene with eight π-electrons (four double bonds). Systems with 4n π-electrons, where n is an integer (here n=2), follow a specific set of rules for their pericyclic reactions.\n\n### 2. Applying Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory\nFor a thermal pericyclic reaction, we must consider the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the ground state of the polyene. For an 8π-electron system like octatetraene, the HOMO is the ψ₄ molecular orbital. The symmetry of the terminal lobes of the HOMO dictates the direction of ring closure. In the ψ₄ HOMO of a linear polyene, the p-orbital lobes on the terminal carbons have opposite phases (an antisymmetric relationship).\n\nTo form a new sigma (σ) bond, these lobes must rotate to allow for constructive overlap (lobes of the same phase overlapping). Given the antisymmetric nature of the HOMO's terminal lobes, this can only be achieved if the two ends of the polyene rotate in the same direction—either both clockwise or both counter-clockwise. This mode of rotation is called **conrotatory**.\n\n### 3. Determining the Stereochemical Outcome\nThe stereospecificity of an electrocyclic reaction means that the stereochemistry of the reactant directly determines the stereochemistry of the product. The reactant is specified as \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The key stereochemical information comes from the configuration at the terminal double bonds of the reacting system (the C2-C3 and C8-C9 bonds). The reactant has a *Z* configuration at one end and an *E* configuration at the other.\n\nThe rules for an 8π (or any 4n π) thermal electrocyclization are as follows:\n*   An **(E,E)** or **(Z,Z)**-configured reactant gives the **trans** product.\n*   An **(E,Z)**-configured reactant gives the **cis** product.\n\nSince the starting material is \\((2Z, ..., 8E)\\), it falls into the (E,Z) category. Therefore, the conrotatory ring closure will lead specifically to the *cis*-isomer (A).\n\nThis specific reaction has been studied and confirms the theoretical prediction. The thermal electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene stereospecifically yields *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene (Isomer A) as the only product. The formation of the *trans*-isomer (Isomer B) is a symmetry-forbidden process for this starting material.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on FMO theory, the thermal electrocyclic ring closure of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a conrotatory process that is highly stereospecific. It exclusively produces the *cis*-isomer (A). The *trans*-isomer (B) is not formed. Therefore, the ratio of A to B is 1:0.\n\n<<<1:0>>>"
