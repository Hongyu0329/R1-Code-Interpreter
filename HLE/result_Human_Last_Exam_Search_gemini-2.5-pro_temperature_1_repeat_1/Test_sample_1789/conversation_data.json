    "Answering the question of the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset of the number 823564528378596 requires the application of Greene's theorem. This theorem from poset theory states that the maximum size of a union of *k* antichains is equal to the sum of the sizes of the *k* largest disjoint chains in the poset.\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the divisor poset for the number N = 823564528378596. This begins with finding the prime factorization of N.\n\nThe prime factorization of 823564528378596 is:\n2² × 3¹ × 7¹ × 11¹ × 13¹ × 17¹ × 19¹ × 23¹ × 29¹ × 31¹ × 37¹ × 41¹ × 43¹ × 47¹ × 53¹\n\nThe elements of the divisor poset are the divisors of N, and the partial order is divisibility. A chain in this poset is a sequence of divisors where each divides the next. The length of a maximal chain (a chain that cannot be extended) in the divisor poset of a number N = p₁ᵉ¹ * p₂ᵉ² * ... * pᵣᵉᵣ is given by the sum of the exponents of its prime factors, plus one (counting the number of elements in the chain).\n\nThe sum of the exponents, denoted as Ω(N), for our number is:\nΩ(823564528378596) = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16\n\nTherefore, the length of any maximal chain in this poset is Ω(N) + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17.\n\nAccording to Greene's theorem, to find the size of the largest union of 20 antichains, we need to find the sum of the lengths of the 20 largest disjoint chains. A key property of the divisor poset is that it is a distributive lattice and admits a symmetric chain decomposition. This means the entire poset can be partitioned into disjoint chains.\n\nGiven that the total number of divisors is (2+1) × (1+1)¹⁴ = 3 × 16384 = 49,152, which is significantly larger than 20 × 17 = 340, we can be confident that there exist at least 20 disjoint maximal chains. Since all maximal chains have the same length (17), the 20 largest disjoint chains will all be maximal chains.\n\nThus, the size of the largest union of 20 antichains is the sum of the lengths of these 20 disjoint maximal chains:\nSize = 20 × (length of a maximal chain) = 20 × 17 = 340.\n\n<<<340>>>"
