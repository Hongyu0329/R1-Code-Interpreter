    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the repeating pattern and the residues located at the core positions.\n\n### Sequence Analysis\n\nCoiled coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeat, known as a heptad, with positions labeled `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The core of the coiled-coil, which dictates its structure and stability, is formed by the residues at the `a` and `d` positions. These are typically hydrophobic.\n\nBy analyzing the provided sequence, the most plausible heptad register places the Isoleucine (I) residues at the `a` positions and the Serine (S) residues at the `d` positions.\n\nLet's align the sequence to this register:\n`c d e f g a b`\n`G E` **`I`**`A Q`**`S`**`L` `K E` **`I`**`A K`**`S`**`L` `K E` **`I`**`A W`**`S`**`L` `K E` **`I`**`A Q`**`S`**`L` `K G`\n\nThis alignment reveals a consistent pattern for the core positions over four heptads:\n*   **Position `a`:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **Position `d`:** S, S, S, S (Serine)\n\n### Knobs-into-Holes Packing and Oligomeric State\n\nThe \"knobs-into-holes\" model describes how side chains from adjacent helices interlock to form a stable core. The specific amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n\nThe pattern identified in this sequence (`a`=I, `d`=S) has specific implications:\n\n1.  **Isoleucine (I) at position `a`**: Isoleucine is a bulky, Î²-branched hydrophobic amino acid. When placed at the `a` position, its shape is well-accommodated in dimeric and trimeric structures. However, in a tetramer, the packing of four Isoleucine residues becomes sterically hindered, making this arrangement less favorable.\n\n2.  **Serine (S) at position `d`**: Serine is a small, polar amino acid. Placing a polar residue in the hydrophobic core is generally unfavorable unless it can form stabilizing hydrogen bonds.\n    *   In a **dimer**, two Serine residues would have limited ability to form a stable hydrogen-bond network.\n    *   In a **trimer**, three Serine side chains can orient towards the center of the helical bundle to form a stable, planar network of hydrogen bonds. This arrangement effectively compensates for the energetic penalty of burying polar groups away from water.\n    *   In a **tetramer**, packing four Serine residues could also be possible, but the geometry is often less ideal than in a trimer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of a bulky hydrophobic residue (Isoleucine) at the `a` position and a small polar residue (Serine) at the `d` position points strongly toward a trimeric structure. The steric bulk of Isoleucine disfavors tetramers, while the need for the polar Serine residues to form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network disfavors dimers. The trimeric arrangement provides the optimal packing efficiency for this specific combination of core residues. Studies using prediction algorithms like LOGICOIL have also found that pairings of hydrophobic and polar residues in the `a` and `d` positions tend to favor trimeric structures.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein sequence would be 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
