For a given momentum transfer **q**, the effective electron-electron interaction, mediated by phonons, is given by:

$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, \nu_n) = - \sum_j \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m} \frac{1}{\omega_q^2 + \nu_n^2}$

where $\nu_n$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies. This interaction is attractive (indicated by the negative sign) and frequency-dependent (retarded). At zero frequency ($\nu_n=0$), it becomes $V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, 0) = - \sum_j \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m \omega_q^2}$.
