    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of Snaut who is so homesick for Earth that he creates a way to simulate the sound of rustling leaves.\n\nOn the space station, the crew members find ways to cope with their isolation and the strange phenomena caused by the sentient planet Solaris. To replicate the sounds of his former life on Earth, Snaut attaches strips of paper to the air vents, which he claims sound like the rustling of leaves at night. This act highlights the profound sense of loss and longing for the natural world that the characters experience while in the sterile environment of space.\n\nWhile the theme of shame is also central to the film, it is most explicitly connected to the character of Gibarian, who is said to have died from it. However, the specific act of missing and recreating the sound of rustling leaves is attributed to Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
