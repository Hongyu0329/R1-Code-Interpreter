    "The most commonly used specific name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is \"fairy bees\". This name is used to describe these small and often brightly colored bees. The genus is also referred to as \"miner bees,\" although this name is more broadly applied to the entire Andrenidae family, to which *Perdita* belongs, due to their ground-nesting habits.\n\nThe precise year that the name \"fairy bees\" was coined for this genus is not definitively documented in the available resources. However, its usage in various guides and online databases, such as the Vermont Atlas of Life and the Native Bees of Texas, indicates it is a recognized and current common name. An article from as early as 2010 refers to bees of the genus *Perdita* and notes their striking appearance, which is consistent with the \"fairy bee\" moniker.\n\n<<<fairy bees, not found>>>"
