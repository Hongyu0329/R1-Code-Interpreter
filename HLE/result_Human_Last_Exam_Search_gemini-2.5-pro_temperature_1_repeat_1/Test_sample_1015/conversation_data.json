    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip. While multiple elements including arm and head placement differ between the two techniques, the approach to the hips is a fundamental differentiator.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and strong torso and hips. The movement should be initiated from the spine, with the hips remaining aligned. This method prioritizes precise coordination of the entire body, with the arms and head having specific, codified placements to create a clean and expressive line. For instance, in a cambré derrière, a Vaganova dancer would typically turn their face towards the working arm while keeping the hips square.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for a more dynamic and athletic quality, which often involves breaking the strict alignment of the torso and hips to create longer lines. A notable characteristic of the Balanchine style is the open hip in arabesque, a principle that extends to other movements to give the illusion of a more expansive line. This technique allows for what is sometimes described as \"swaying hips\" and a greater sense of fluidity through the upper body. Therefore, in a Balanchine cambré derrière, a dancer is more likely to open the hip of the supporting leg to achieve a greater range of motion and a more dramatic line, a direct contrast to the Vaganova emphasis on a squared torso.\n\nWhile arm placement is also distinct, with Balanchine often featuring more open and less curved port de bras, and Vaganova emphasizing softer, more elongated arm positions, the foundational difference in the use of the hips during a cambré derrière is a more central point of divergence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
