    "To determine the largest value of $p$ for which the function $I(a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need to find the supremum of all $p$ such that the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da_1 \\dots da_9$ diverges. This is often called the critical exponent.\n\nThe function is given by the oscillatory integral:\n$I(a) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i \\phi(x, y, a)} dxdy$\nwhere the phase is a polynomial of degree 3:\n$\\phi(x, y, a) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$.\n\nThe convergence of the $L^p$ integral depends on the rate of decay of $|I(a)|$ as $|a| \\to \\infty$. The decay rate can vary depending on the direction of the vector $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$. Let's write the integral in spherical coordinates for $\\mathbb{R}^9$, with $a = \\lambda \\omega$, where $\\lambda = |a|$ is the radius and $\\omega \\in S^8$ is a direction vector on the unit sphere. The volume element is $da = \\lambda^8 d\\lambda d\\omega$.\n\nThe $L^p$ integral is:\n$\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da = \\int_0^\\infty \\lambda^8 \\left( \\int_{S^8} |I(\\lambda \\omega)|^p d\\omega \\right) d\\lambda$\n\nThe asymptotic behavior of $I(\\lambda \\omega)$ for large $\\lambda$ is typically of the form $|I(\\lambda \\omega)| \\sim C(\\omega) \\lambda^{-\\sigma(\\omega)}$, where $\\sigma(\\omega)$ is the decay exponent which depends on the direction $\\omega$. The divergence of the integral with respect to $\\lambda$ is governed by the smallest possible decay exponent, $\\sigma_{min} = \\inf_{\\omega \\in S^8} \\sigma(\\omega)$.\n\nFor the directions $\\omega$ where the decay is slowest (i.e., where $\\sigma(\\omega) = \\sigma_{min}$), the integral behaves like:\n$\\int^\\infty \\lambda^8 (\\lambda^{-\\sigma_{min}})^p d\\lambda = \\int^\\infty \\lambda^{8 - p\\sigma_{min}} d\\lambda$\n\nThis integral diverges at the upper limit if the exponent is greater than or equal to -1:\n$8 - p\\sigma_{min} \\ge -1 \\implies 9 \\ge p\\sigma_{min} \\implies p \\le \\frac{9}{\\sigma_{min}}$\n\nSo, $I(a)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for $p \\le 9/\\sigma_{min}$. The largest such $p$ is $9/\\sigma_{min}$. Our task is to find the minimum decay exponent $\\sigma_{min}$.\n\nThe decay exponent $\\sigma$ is determined by the nature of the phase function $\\phi(x, y, \\omega)$. Slower decay is associated with degeneracies of the phase, i.e., points where its gradient is zero (stationary points), especially if those points are themselves degenerate.\n\nLet's test some specific directions $\\omega$ corresponding to single coefficients $a_k$.\n1.  **Linear term:** Let $a = (a_1, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n    $I(a_1, 0, \\dots) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_1 x} dx dy = \\frac{e^{2\\pi i a_1} - 1}{2\\pi i a_1}$.\n    For large $|a_1|$, $|I| \\sim |a_1|^{-1}$. So, $\\sigma = 1$. This would imply $p \\le 9$.\n\n2.  **Quadratic term:** Let $a = (0, 0, a_3, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n    $I(0, 0, a_3, \\dots) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_3 x^2} dx dy = \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_3 x^2} dx$.\n    This is a Fresnel integral. For large $|a_3|$, its magnitude decays as $|a_3|^{-1/2}$. Thus, $\\sigma = 1/2$. This implies $p \\le 9/(1/2) = 18$.\n\n3.  **Cubic term:** Let $a = (0, \\dots, 0, a_6, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n    $I(\\dots, a_6, \\dots) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_6 x^3} dx dy = \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_6 x^3} dx$.\n    The phase $\\phi(x) = x^3$ has a degenerate stationary point at $x=0$, since $\\phi'(0) = \\phi''(0) = 0$. By the method of stationary phase for degenerate points (or by a change of variable $u = a_6^{1/3}x$), the integral decays as $|a_6|^{-1/3}$. So, $\\sigma = 1/3$. This implies $p \\le 9/(1/3) = 27$.\n\n4.  **Mixed cubic term:** Let $a = (0, \\dots, 0, a_7, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n    $I(\\dots, a_7, \\dots) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_7 x^2 y} dx dy$.\n    Integrating with respect to $y$ first gives:\n    $\\int_0^1 \\frac{e^{2\\pi i a_7 x^2} - 1}{2\\pi i a_7 x^2} dx$.\n    By a change of variable $u = \\sqrt{a_7} x$, this integral can be shown to decay as $|a_7|^{-1/2}$. So, $\\sigma = 1/2$. This implies $p \\le 18$.\n\nThe slowest decay rate (smallest $\\sigma$) found so far is $1/3$, which occurs for phases like $a_6x^3$ and, by symmetry, $a_9y^3$. The decay exponent $\\sigma$ is related to the highest order of contact a hyperplane can have with the surface $M = \\{(\\psi_1(x,y), ..., \\psi_9(x,y)) : (x,y) \\in^2 \\}$. The highest degree of the monomials is 3, which limits the order of contact and suggests that the worst-case singularities of the phase function are of degree 3. Analysis of the possible cubic forms that can be generated shows that the one giving the slowest decay is of the form $(c_1 x + c_2 y)^3$, which, after rotation, is equivalent to a phase depending on a single variable, like $x^3$. This confirms that the minimal decay exponent is $\\sigma_{min} = 1/3$.\n\nUsing this value, we can find the critical exponent $p$:\n$p \\le \\frac{9}{\\sigma_{min}} = \\frac{9}{1/3} = 27$.\n\nThe function $I(a)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for $p \\le 27$. The largest such value of $p$ is 27.\n\n"
