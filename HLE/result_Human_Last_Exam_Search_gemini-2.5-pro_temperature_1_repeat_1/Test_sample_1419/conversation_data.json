    "### The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions is given by the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nIn the framework of the renormalization group and the epsilon expansion, where space's dimension is taken as d = 4 - ϵ with ϵ being a small parameter, the theory of a scalar field with a quartic self-interaction (ϕ⁴ theory) possesses a non-trivial fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This fixed point governs the universal critical behavior of systems described by this theory, such as the Ising model near its critical temperature.\n\nThe position of this fixed point for the coupling constant, denoted here as u*, can be calculated perturbatively as a series in ϵ. To the leading order in ϵ, the fixed point coupling is directly proportional to ϵ.\n\nThe one-loop beta function, which describes the running of the coupling constant `g` with the energy scale, is given by:\nβ(g) = -ϵg + (3 / (16π²))g² + O(g³)\n\nThe fixed point g* is found by setting the beta function to zero (β(g*) = 0). Ignoring the trivial solution g* = 0, we find:\n-ϵg* + (3 / (16π²))(g*)² = 0\n\nThis gives the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling:\ng* = (16π² / 3)ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n\nIdentifying the coupling `g` with `u`, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is:\n\n**u* = (16π² / 3)ϵ**\n\nThis result is fundamental in the study of critical phenomena and quantum field theory, providing a key example of a non-trivial, calculable fixed point that controls the behavior of a physical system over a wide range of scales.\n\n<<<u* = (16π² / 3)ϵ>>>"
