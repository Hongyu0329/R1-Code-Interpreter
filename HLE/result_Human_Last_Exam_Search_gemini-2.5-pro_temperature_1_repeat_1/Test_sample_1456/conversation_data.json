    "A continuum is defined as a nonempty, compact, connected metric space. A continuum is called nondegenerate if it consists of more than one point. The product of two continua is also a continuum. The number of composants of a continuum depends on its topological structure, specifically whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\nA decomposable continuum is one that can be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. For a decomposable metric continuum, the number of composants is either one or three. For example, a simple arc has one composant, while a triod (three arcs joined at a common endpoint) has three.\n\nAn indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that every nondegenerate, metrizable, indecomposable continuum has exactly **c** composants, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum (the number of points on the real line). Examples of such continua include the pseudo-arc and the Knaster bucket-handle continuum.\n\nTo find the largest possible number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua, let's denote the continua by X and Y. We need to consider the case that maximizes the number of composants of their product, X × Y.\n\nIf we choose X and Y to be indecomposable continua, their product X × Y can also be indecomposable. A theorem by W.T. Ingram states that the product of two indecomposable continua is indecomposable, provided that at least one of them is not arcwise connected. The pseudo-arc is a classic example of an indecomposable continuum that is not arcwise connected.\n\nLet X and Y both be the pseudo-arc. The pseudo-arc is a nondegenerate continuum. Their product, X × Y, is an indecomposable continuum. Since the pseudo-arc is a metric space, the product space X × Y is also a metric space. As a nondegenerate, metrizable, indecomposable continuum, the product space X × Y has **c** composants.\n\nComparing the possible number of composants:\n*   If X × Y is decomposable, it has 1 or 3 composants.\n*   If X × Y is indecomposable and metric, it has **c** composants.\n\nSince **c** is an infinite cardinal, it is the largest possible number of composants. This maximum is achieved, for example, by the product of two pseudo-arcs.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
