    "**The identity of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461 remains undetermined based on currently accessible online records.**\n\nWhile historical sources confirm that the free royal town of Bártfa had a functioning administration that included a judge and a town council during this period, the name of the specific individual who held the judicial office in 1461 is not readily available in digitized documents or scholarly publications.\n\nHistorical records from the 15th century make reference to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa,\" indicating the existence of this position within the town's governance. The primary source for such information would be the extensive archival collection, \"Bártfa szabad királyi város levéltára 1319–1526\" (Archives of the Free Royal Town of Bártfa 1319–1526), compiled by Hungarian historian Béla Iványi. This collection contains the official records of the town, and it is highly probable that the names of municipal officials, including the judge for 1461, are documented within these archives.\n\nDespite numerous references to this archival collection in scholarly works, its contents are not fully digitized or indexed for public online searches. Consequently, without direct access to these historical documents, the name of the judge of Bártfa for the year 1461 cannot be definitively ascertained at this time. The 15th century was a \"Golden Age\" for Bardejov, which was a significant center of trade and crafts in the Kingdom of Hungary. The town's administration would have played a crucial role in its prosperity.\n\nFurther research would necessitate a direct examination of the aforementioned archival collection or consultation of specialized historical studies on the administration of 15th-century Bártfa that may have transcribed or indexed these records."
