    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold denoted by $G(3,5)$. By taking the orthogonal complement, this space is homeomorphic to the Grassmannian of $2$-planes in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, denoted $G(2,5)$. Therefore, their integral cohomology rings, $H^*(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$ and $H^*(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z})$, are isomorphic.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups of $G(2,5)$ have been computed and are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^2(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^3(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^4(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$\n*   $H^6(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of these groups. The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order. In this case, the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group:\n$T = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$\n\nThe rank of an abelian group is the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its free part, according to the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups. A torsion group, by definition, is a group where every element has finite order. Consequently, a torsion group has no free part, or its free part is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. Therefore, the rank of any torsion group is 0.\n\nSince the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of $G(3,5)$ is a torsion group, its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
