    "The first step successfully identified the date of the 1940 armistice. The Armistice of 22 June 1940 was signed on June 22, 1940, and became effective at midnight on June 25, 1940. Therefore, the search for the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat should be for incidents occurring before June 25, 1940.\n\nThe initial search for French ships sunk by U-boats provided some information, but a comprehensive list of all French ships sunk by U-boats before the armistice, along with their displacements, is still needed to definitively identify the largest one. The search results mentioned the submarine \"Doris\" being sunk on May 8, 1940, but to answer the user's question accurately, a more exhaustive list is required.\nI will now execute the next step to find a more comprehensive list.The search results have provided some initial leads. I've found mentions of several French ships sunk during the specified period, including the battleship *Bretagne* and the submarine *Doris*. However, the sinking of the *Bretagne* was by British forces at Mers-el-Kébir, not by a U-boat, so it is not a candidate. The sinking of the submarine *Doris* is noted, but its displacement is relatively small. The key missing pieces of information are a comprehensive list of all French ships, both naval and merchant, sunk by U-boats before the armistice on June 25, 1940, and crucially, the displacement figures for each of these vessels. Without a systematic list and their corresponding displacements, it is impossible to definitively identify the largest ship. The current information is fragmented and insufficient to provide a conclusive answer. Therefore, I need to perform more targeted searches to create this comprehensive list and find the displacements.The search results have provided significant information. I have found several French ships that were sunk by U-boats before the armistice on June 25, 1940. Specifically, the motor passenger ship *Brazza* with a tonnage of 10,387 tons, and the steam merchant *Bretagne* with a tonnage of 10,108 tons, were both sunk by U-boats. The battleship *Bretagne* was also mentioned, but it was sunk by British forces, not a U-boat. I need to confirm if \"tonnage\" in these search results refers to displacement. Assuming gross register tonnage is a reasonable proxy for displacement in the absence of more specific data, the *Brazza* appears to be the larger of the two. To be certain, I will conduct a final search to see if I can find a more comprehensive list with confirmed displacement values and to ensure no larger vessel has been missed.The search results from the previous steps have identified two primary candidates for the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice: the motor passenger ship *Brazza* and the steam merchant *Bretagne*. The *Brazza* is listed with a tonnage of 10,387 tons, and the *Bretagne* is listed with a tonnage of 10,108 tons and 10,171 GRT. The searches also clarified the difference between gross register tonnage (a measure of volume) and displacement (a measure of weight). For merchant ships, GRT is a common measurement, and while not identical to displacement, it provides a good basis for comparison of size. No other sunken French ship has been found with a comparable or larger tonnage. The sinking of the battleship *Bretagne* was by the British Royal Navy, not a U-boat, and is therefore excluded. Based on the available information, the *Brazza* appears to be the larger vessel. No further searches are required to answer the user's question.\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the motor passenger ship **SS *Brazza***.\n\nThe *Brazza*, with a tonnage of 10,387 tons, was sunk on May 28, 1940, by the German U-boat U-37. The ship was part of convoy 60-XF, en route from Bordeaux to Casablanca, when it was torpedoed about 80 miles west of Cape Finisterre. The attack resulted in the loss of 379 lives, including the master, 79 crew members, and 299 passengers.\n\nAnother significant loss for the French merchant marine during this period was the steam merchant SS *Bretagne*, which had a gross register tonnage of 10,171 tons. It was sunk on October 14, 1939, by the U-boat U-45. While the battleship *Bretagne* was also sunk in 1940, its demise came at the hands of the British Royal Navy during the attack on Mers-el-Kébir and not by a U-boat.\n\nThe armistice between France and Germany was signed on June 22, 1940, and came into effect on June 25, 1940. Therefore, the sinking of the *Brazza* occurred within the specified timeframe. Gross register tonnage, a measure of a ship's internal volume, is a standard metric for civilian vessels of that era and serves as a reliable indicator of a ship's overall size when exact displacement figures are not available.\n\n<<<SS Brazza>>>"
