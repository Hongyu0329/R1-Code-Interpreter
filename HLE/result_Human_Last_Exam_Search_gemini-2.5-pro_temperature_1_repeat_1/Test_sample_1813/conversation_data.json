    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we refer to the work of E. Banaian and A. Sen in their paper \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers\". In this paper, they explore a generalization of Markov numbers connected to a specific generalized cluster algebra arising from a once-punctured sphere with three orbifold points of order three. The generalized Markov equation in this context is given by \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz\\).\n\nThese generalized Markov numbers, denoted as \\( m_{p/q} \\), are indexed by rational numbers \\( p/q \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are coprime integers with \\( p < q \\). The authors provide an algorithm to determine the continued fraction associated with each \\( m_{p/q} \\) by constructing a sign sequence from which the continued fraction is derived.\n\nThe paper includes a table of these continued fractions for small values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\). For the specific case of \\( p=4 \\) and \\( q=7 \\), the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is given as:\n\n\n\nThis sequence is obtained from a sign sequence associated with an arc on the corresponding orbifold, where the lengths of consecutive runs of the same sign determine the coefficients of the continued fraction.\n\n<<<>>>"
