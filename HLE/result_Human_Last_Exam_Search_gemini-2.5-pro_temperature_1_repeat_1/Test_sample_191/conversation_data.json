    "When certain proteins are broken down or inhibited, it can allow for greater engulfment of amyloid by macrophages and microglia (the brain's resident macrophages). The most prominent of these proteins is **CD33**.\n\n**CD33** is a protein found on the surface of microglia that has been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. This protein acts as an inhibitor of amyloid-beta (Aβ) uptake. Research has shown that a reduction in the levels or function of CD33 leads to an increase in the ability of microglia to clear Aβ plaques through phagocytosis.\n\nSeveral key findings highlight the role of CD33's \"breakdown\" in allowing for amyloid engulfment:\n*   Individuals with a specific genetic variation (SNP rs3865444) that leads to lower CD33 expression are more protected against Alzheimer's disease.\n*   In mouse models of Alzheimer's, the absence of the CD33 gene resulted in a marked reduction in insoluble Aβ42 levels and amyloid plaque burden.\n*   CD33 has different forms, or isoforms. The longer form (CD33M) inhibits the engulfment of amyloid, while a shorter form (CD33m), which lacks the domain responsible for binding, is associated with protection against Alzheimer's and promotes the clearance of amyloid plaques.\n*   The inhibitory function of CD33 depends on its ability to bind to specific molecules called sialic acids. When this binding is blocked or the binding domain is absent, the inhibition is lifted, and microglia are better able to engulf amyloid-beta.\n\nAnother protein that fits this description is **Glia Maturation Factor-γ (GMFG)**.\n\n*   Studies have demonstrated that reducing the amount of GMFG in macrophages leads to an increased engulfment of amyloid-beta.\n*   Conversely, when GMFG is overexpressed, the uptake of amyloid-beta by these cells is reduced. This indicates that, similar to CD33, the functional breakdown or reduction of GMFG allows for enhanced phagocytosis of amyloid.\n\nTherefore, the breakdown or inhibition of proteins like CD33 and GMFG removes a brake on the phagocytic activity of macrophages and microglia, allowing them to more effectively engulf and clear amyloid deposits.\n\n<<<CD33>>>"
