    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is typically referred to as the extended Galilei group, which is an 11-dimensional Lie group. However, the maximal Lie invariance algebra of these equations is, in fact, infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe 11-dimensional Lie group consists of the following transformations:\n*   **Time translations:** One parameter for shifts in time.\n*   **Space translations:** Three parameters for shifts in the three spatial directions.\n*   **Rotations:** Three parameters for rotations in three-dimensional space.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Three parameters for transformations to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** A single parameter that scales the coordinates, time, velocity, and pressure in a specific way that leaves the equations unchanged.\n\nThe sum of these parameters (1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1) gives the dimension of this classical symmetry group.\n\nThe infinite-dimensional nature of the maximal Lie invariance algebra arises from the inclusion of transformations involving arbitrary functions of time. These are often considered \"less physical\" and are not typically included when discussing the fundamental symmetries of the equations in a physical context.\n\n<<<11>>>"
