    "An upper bound for the maximum norm, in the context of automorphic forms, can be established in relation to the covolume for squarefree natural numbers. The problem is best understood in the setting of the sup-norm of Hecke-Maass cusp forms on arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces.\n\nLet $N$ be a squarefree natural number. Consider the arithmetic surface $Y_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, where $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is a principal congruence subgroup of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ and $\\mathbb{H}$ is the upper half-plane. The covolume $V$ of this surface is given by $V = \\text{vol}(Y_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H})$, which is directly proportional to the level $N$.\n\nThe \"maximum norm,\" denoted in the query as $(k_{k,\\infty})$, is interpreted as the sup-norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm) $\\|f\\|_{\\infty}$ of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ on this surface. Such a form is an eigenfunction of the hyperbolic Laplacian with eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and of all Hecke operators.\n\nFor a Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$, a hybrid upper bound for its sup-norm has been established. This bound provides a relationship between the sup-norm, the eigenvalue, and the level (and thus the covolume).\n\nA key result in this area, which generalizes previous bounds in both the eigenvalue and level aspects, gives the following relationship:\n$\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} N^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$\n\nHere, $\\|f\\|_{\\infty}$ is the maximum value of the form on the surface, $\\lambda$ is its Laplacian eigenvalue, $N$ is the squarefree level, and $\\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive number. The implied constant depends only on $\\epsilon$.\n\nSince the covolume $V$ is proportional to $N$ for squarefree levels, this upper bound can be expressed in terms of the covolume $V$ as:\n$\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} V^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$\n\nThis inequality demonstrates that as the covolume of the arithmetic surface increases (which corresponds to an increasing level $N$), the maximum value of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass form is bounded and, in fact, tends to decrease. This is a significant result in the analytic theory of automorphic forms, with connections to quantum chaos and the subconvexity problem for L-functions. Earlier work by Harcos and Templier established a bound of $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$ for fixed eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The hybrid bound by Templier is a simultaneous generalization of the best known bounds in both the eigenvalue and level aspects.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the sup-norm of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ with Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ on an arithmetic surface of squarefree level $N$ and covolume $V$ is given by $\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} V^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$.>>>"
