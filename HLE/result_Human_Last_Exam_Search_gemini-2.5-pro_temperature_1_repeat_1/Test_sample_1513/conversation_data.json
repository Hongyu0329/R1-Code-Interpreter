    "An island town situated over 500 kilometers from the closest inhabited island, which rests on a bay created by a volcanic caldera bearing the same name as the town, is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n\nEaster Island, a Chilean territory, is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. The nearest inhabited land is Pitcairn Island, over 1,900 kilometers away.\n\nThe island's main town and harbor is Hanga Roa, which translates to \"Long Bay\" or \"Wide Bay\". The town is situated on the west coast, nestled between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau. The impressive caldera of Rano Kau is a significant geographical feature of the island, and its volcanic activity shaped the landscape. While the bay of Hanga Roa is not a classic caldera in itself, its formation is a direct result of the island's volcanic history, and it shares its name with the town. The water for Hanga Roa is even sourced from the crater lake of Rano Kau.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
