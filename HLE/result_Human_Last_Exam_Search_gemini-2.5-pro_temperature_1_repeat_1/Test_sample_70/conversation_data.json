    "When viewed as matrices, the flags of **Benin, Cameroon, Madagascar, Morocco, Senegal, and Somalia** have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\nThe flag of Denmark, with its white cross on a red field, can be represented as a matrix with two distinct, linearly independent row types: rows with red and white, and rows with only white. This gives the Danish flag a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2. The flags of the African nations listed below also have a rank of 2.\n\nHere is the list of these flags and the reasoning for their rank:\n\n*   **Benin:** The flag consists of a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of yellow and red. This creates two unique types of row vectors: one with green and yellow, and another with green and red. These two row types are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Cameroon:** The flag is a vertical tricolor of green, red, and yellow, with a yellow star in the center red band. The rows without the star are identical, and the rows that include the central star form a second, distinct set of linearly independent vectors. This two-vector basis gives the flag a rank of 2.\n*   **Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white band at the hoist with horizontal red and green bands. Similar to Benin's flag, this design creates two types of linearly independent row vectors (white/red and white/green), resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Morocco:** The flag features a red field with a green, five-pointed linear star in the center. The rows of the plain red field constitute one type of vector, while the rows that intersect the green star create a second, linearly independent vector type. The rank is therefore 2.\n*   **Senegal:** The flag is a vertical tricolor of green, yellow, and red, with a green star in the central yellow band. Much like the flag of Cameroon, this design results in two types of linearly independent row vectors—those with the star and those without—giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Somalia:** The flag has a light blue field with a central five-pointed white star. The plain blue rows and the rows containing the white star are distinct and linearly independent, which results in a matrix rank of 2.\n\n<<<Benin, Cameroon, Madagascar, Morocco, Senegal, Somalia>>>"
