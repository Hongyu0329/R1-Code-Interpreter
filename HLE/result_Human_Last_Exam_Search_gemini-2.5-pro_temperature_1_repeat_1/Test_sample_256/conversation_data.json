    "The symmetry group for the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₁.\n\nThis information is based on the comprehensive database of circle packings maintained by Eckard Specht, which lists the best-known configurations for up to N=2600 circles. For an arrangement of 1135 circles, the designated symmetry group is C₁. In Schoenflies notation, C₁ represents a group with only a 1-fold rotational axis (i.e., rotation by 360°), which is the identity element. This signifies that the packing arrangement is asymmetric.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
