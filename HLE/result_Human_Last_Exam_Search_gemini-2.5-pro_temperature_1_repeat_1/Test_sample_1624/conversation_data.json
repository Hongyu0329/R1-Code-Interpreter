    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n1.  **The space X is separable.** A topological space is called separable if it contains a countable, dense subset. A key theorem in topology states that a connected, locally separable metric space is separable.\n    *   The space $X$ is a connected metric space by hypothesis.\n    *   To see that $X$ is locally separable, consider any point $x \\in X$. Since $U$ is a dense open subset, any neighborhood of a point in $X \\setminus U$ must intersect $U$. For any point $p \\in U$, it has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $\\mathbb{R}$ is a separable space, this means every point in the dense set $U$ has a separable neighborhood. This property is sufficient to establish that the entire connected metric space $X$ is separable.\n    *   Alternatively, the open set $U$, being a 1-dimensional manifold, is second-countable and therefore separable. Let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $U$. Since $U$ is dense in $X$, the closure of $D$ in $X$ is equal to the closure of $U$ in $X$, which is $X$. Thus, $D$ is a countable dense subset of $X$, which proves that $X$ is separable.\n\n2.  **Separable metric spaces have a bounded cardinality.** Any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum. This can be shown by considering that each point in the space is uniquely determined by its distances from the points in the countable dense subset. This establishes an injective map from the space into the set of real-valued functions on a countable set, which has cardinality $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n3.  **The cardinality of X is at least the continuum.** The space $X$ is a connected metric space. Since $U$ is a non-empty open set, $X$ must contain more than one point. Any non-trivial connected metric space (one with more than one point) has a cardinality of at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This can be demonstrated by picking two distinct points, $p$ and $q$, and considering the continuous function $f(x) = d(x, p)$, where $d$ is the metric. The image of this function, $f(X)$, must be a connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, which is an interval. Since $f(p)=0$ and $f(q)=d(p,q)>0$, this interval is non-trivial and thus has a cardinality of $2^{\\aleph_0}$. The domain of a function must have a cardinality at least as large as its image, so $|X| \\ge 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nCombining these points, the cardinality of $X$ is bounded above by $2^{\\aleph_0}$ and bounded below by $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Therefore, the cardinality of $X$ must be exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<The upper bound on the cardinality of $X$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
