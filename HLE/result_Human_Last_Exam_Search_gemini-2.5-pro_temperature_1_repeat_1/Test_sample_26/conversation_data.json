    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1.\n\nHere is a summary of the argument to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Topological Properties of X**: The space $X$ is a smooth complex surface of dimension 2 (a real 4-manifold) embedded in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < 2$. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, it follows that $X$ is simply connected, i.e., $\\pi_1(X) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Homology of X**: The Betti numbers of a smooth quintic surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ are well-known from algebraic geometry. The non-trivial Betti numbers are $b_0(X)=1$, $b_2(X)=53$, and $b_4(X)=1$. All odd-dimensional Betti numbers are zero, so $b_1(X) = b_3(X) = 0$. Since there is no torsion in the homology of such a manifold, we have $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Hurewicz Theorem**: Since $X$ is simply connected, the Hurewicz theorem relates its homotopy and homology groups.\n    *   $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n    *   The Hurewicz map $h: \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X)$ is surjective. As $H_3(X) = 0$, this implies $\\pi_3(X)$ lies entirely in the kernel of the Hurewicz map.\n\n4.  **Relating X to its Complement**: A powerful technique is to relate the topology of $X$ to that of its complement, $U = \\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X$. Let $N$ be a tubular neighborhood of $X$.\n    *   The boundary of this neighborhood, $\\partial N$, is a circle bundle over $X$. The long exact sequence of homotopy for this fibration shows that $\\pi_k(\\partial N) \\cong \\pi_k(X)$ for $k \\ge 3$. Thus, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\partial N)$.\n    *   The space $W = \\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus \\text{int}(N)$ is a manifold with boundary $\\partial N$ and is homotopy equivalent to the complement $U$.\n\n5.  **Homotopy of the Complement**: There are established results on the homotopy groups of complements of hypersurfaces. For a hypersurface of degree $d \\ge 2$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ ($n \\ge 3$), it is known that $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^n \\setminus X) = 0$. For the specific case of $n=3$, it is also known that $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n6.  **Long Exact Sequence of a Pair**: We consider the long exact sequence of relative homotopy groups for the pair $(W, \\partial N)$.\n    $$ \\dots \\to \\pi_k(\\partial N) \\to \\pi_k(W) \\to \\pi_k(W, \\partial N) \\to \\dots $$\n    A detailed analysis of this sequence, using the known homotopy groups of $W \\simeq U$ and the homology groups of $X$, shows that the relative homotopy groups $\\pi_2(W, \\partial N)$ and $\\pi_3(W, \\partial N)$ are trivial.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Because the relative groups $\\pi_2(W, \\partial N)$ and $\\pi_3(W, \\partial N)$ are zero, the map $\\pi_3(\\partial N) \\to \\pi_3(W)$ in the long exact sequence is an isomorphism. Combining the isomorphisms from steps 4 and 5, we have:\n    $$ \\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\partial N) \\cong \\pi_3(W) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} $$\n    The group $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a free abelian group of rank 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
