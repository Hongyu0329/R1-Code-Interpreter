    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is a chemical compound of xenon and fluorine, first synthesized in 1962. It is produced by the direct reaction of xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F₂).\n\nThe most commonly cited method for the synthesis of xenon tetrafluoride involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio in a sealed nickel vessel. This reaction is typically carried out at a temperature of 400°C and a pressure of 6 atm. The reaction is exothermic, releasing 251 kJ/mol of energy. A patent for this process specifies a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction.\n\nWhile the reaction can be initiated under other conditions, they are generally less efficient or produce a mixture of products. For instance, using flow methods, the reaction has been performed in a nickel tube heated to 300-500°C, but this can result in contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF₂). It has been noted that in the thermal reaction of xenon and fluorine, reaction products are only observed at temperatures exceeding 120°C. However, lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of XeF₂, while higher temperatures and excess fluorine favor xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n\nTherefore, the most efficient and established method for producing pure xenon tetrafluoride utilizes a temperature of 400°C.\n\n<<<B>>>"
