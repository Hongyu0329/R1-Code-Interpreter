    "The haiku provides the following clues:\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This points to a significant event in August.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" is 30. This indicates the 30th day of the month.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This suggests the end of a ruler's power.\n\nBased on these clues, the haiku refers to the Gabonese coup d'état that occurred on **August 30, 2023**. On this date, a military coup ousted President Ali Bongo Ondimba, ending his family's 56-year rule in Gabon.\n\nThe title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is a question. The key to the answer lies in the fact that Honolulu, the capital of Hawaii, means \"sheltered bay.\" On August 30, 1850, King Kamehameha III officially made Honolulu the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nTherefore, the answers to the question posed by the title \"The Bays,\" are Gabon and Hawaii. In alphabetical order, the first answer is Gabon.\n\n<<<Gabon>>>"
