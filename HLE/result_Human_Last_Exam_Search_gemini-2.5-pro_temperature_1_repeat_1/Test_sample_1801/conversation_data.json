    "The two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial series were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Paul Krugman.\n\nPhysicist and Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann was identified through multiple sources as having appeared in the commercials. One of the commercials, titled \"Metalman,\" explicitly features him.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, also had a connection to Enron, serving on the company's advisory board in 1999 for which he was paid. While his role was that of a paid consultant and not an actor in the commercials, his association with Enron during that period has been noted.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a broad advertising effort by Enron that included various notable figures to enhance its image of innovation and intellectual rigor. However, the campaign later became a symbol of the company's hubris and deception in the wake of its massive corporate scandal.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
