    "The rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set is determined by a composition operation, specifically a t-norm, between the firing strength of the rule's antecedent, `Phi_k(x′)`, and the membership degree of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation for fuzzy logic.\n\nGiven:\n*   Firing strength `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   Consequent membership degree `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nThe calculation depends on the specific t-norm used. The two most common t-norms are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum T-norm:** The minimum t-norm takes the minimum of the two values.\n\n    Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Using the Product T-norm:** The product t-norm multiplies the two values.\n\n    Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the rule activation level can be either 0.7 (using the minimum t-norm) or 0.63 (using the product t-norm).\n\n<<<The rule activation level is 0.7 when using the minimum t-norm, and 0.63 when using the product t-norm.>>>"
