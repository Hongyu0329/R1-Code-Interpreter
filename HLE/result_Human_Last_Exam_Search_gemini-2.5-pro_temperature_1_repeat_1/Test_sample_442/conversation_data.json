    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" the poetic device, aside from those excluded in the question, is a **transferred epithet**, also known as **hypallage**.\n\nThis is seen with the adjective `almum` (nurturing, kind). Grammatically, `almum` modifies `diem` (day), creating the phrase \"nurturing day.\" However, the quality of being nurturing is more logically an attribute of Lucifer, the morning star, who is being asked to bring the day. Therefore, the epithet \"nurturing\" has been transferred from Lucifer to the day that he brings. The ancient commentator Servius, while analyzing a different line in Vergil, identifies this same device, which he calls hypallage.\n\n<<<Transferred epithet (Hypallage)>>>"
