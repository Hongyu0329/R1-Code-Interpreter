    "To find the state feedback gain matrix `F` that places the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A + BF` at the desired locations, we can use the method of pole placement. The solution for multi-input systems is generally not unique.\n\nGiven the system matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nAnd the desired eigenvalues `λ = -1 ± j`.\n\nFirst, we determine the desired characteristic polynomial from the given eigenvalues:\n`p(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\n`p(s) = (s + 1)² - j²`\n`p(s) = s² + 2s + 1 + 1`\n`p(s) = s² + 2s + 2`\n\nNext, we define the state feedback gain matrix `F` and the closed-loop matrix `A + BF`. Since `A` is a 2x2 matrix and `B` is a 2x2 matrix, `F` must be a 2x2 matrix for the matrix multiplication to be valid.\nLet `F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n\nNow, we compute the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n\nThen, we form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]] = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is given by `det(sI - A_cl) = 0`. For a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]`, the characteristic polynomial is `s² - trace(M)s + det(M)`.\nWe need to match the trace and determinant of `A_cl` with the coefficients of the desired polynomial `s² + 2s + 2`.\n`trace(A_cl) = - (coefficient of s) = -2`\n`det(A_cl) = (constant term) = 2`\n\nFrom the matrix `A_cl`:\n`trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = -2`\n`f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1` (Equation 1)\n\n`det(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)(f₂) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)`\n`det(A_cl) = -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄) = 2`\n`-f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2`\n`-f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns, which confirms that the solution is not unique. We can find a particular solution by setting some of the variables to zero.\n\nLet's assume `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`. The equations simplify to:\n1. `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n2. `-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3`\n\nAdding the two equations:\n`(f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3`\n`-f₂ = 2`\n`f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f₂ = -2` into the first equation:\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁ = 1`\n\nThus, a valid state feedback gain matrix is `F` with `f₁=1`, `f₂=-2`, `f₃=0`, `f₄=0`.\n\n<<<[[1, -2],]>>>"
