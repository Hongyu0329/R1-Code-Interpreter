    "An 8x8 chessboard has a total of 28 edge squares. This includes all the squares on the first and eighth ranks, as well as all the squares on the 'a' and 'h' files.\n\nOn a standard chessboard, these 28 edge squares are divided equally between light and dark colors, meaning there are 14 light edge squares and 14 dark edge squares.\n\nIn the game of chess, bishops are restricted to squares of a single color. A bishop that moves on light squares can never attack a piece that is on a dark square, and vice versa.\n\nThe problem describes a cooperative game played by two people. The most logical interpretation of the rules under these circumstances is that one person would place bishops on the light squares and the other would place them on the dark squares.\n\nFollowing this, they could place one bishop on each of the 14 light-colored edge squares, and none of these bishops would be able to attack one another. Similarly, they could place a bishop on each of the 14 dark-colored edge squares, and none of these would be in a position to attack each other. As bishops on light squares cannot attack those on dark squares, all 28 bishops could be placed on the board without any of them being under attack from another.\n\nTherefore, if the two people succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares, all 28 edge squares would be occupied. This means that zero edge squares would be without a bishop.\n\n<<<0>>>"
