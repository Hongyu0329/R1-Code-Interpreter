    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables, denoted as a(n), is given by the formula 2^(n-1). This formula is widely cited in resources related to digital logic and Boolean algebra.\n\nTo find the value of a(4), we substitute n=4 into the formula:\n\na(4) = 2^(4-1)\na(4) = 2^3\na(4) = 8\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables is 8. This can be visualized using a 4-variable Karnaugh map where a checkerboard pattern of 1s would result in each 1 being a prime implicant, leading to a total of 8 prime implicants.\n\n<<<8>>>"
