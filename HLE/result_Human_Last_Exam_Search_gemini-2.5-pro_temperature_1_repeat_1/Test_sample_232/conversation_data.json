    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the crease lines divide the square piece of paper into 156 distinct regions.\n\nThe pattern of creases on the paper is intricate and symmetrical. The final count is derived by carefully identifying and tallying each individual, enclosed area created by the network of folds. This includes the numerous small triangles and other polygonal shapes that are formed across the entire sheet of paper as a result of the specific sequence of folds required to create the crane.\n\n<<<156>>>"
