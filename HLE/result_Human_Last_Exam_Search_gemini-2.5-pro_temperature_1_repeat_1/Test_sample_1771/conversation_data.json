    "The transformation of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti, meaning '(s)he’s giving a sign' or 'tracks', into its reflexes in Proto-Germanic and its daughter languages involves several key sound changes, primarily Grimm's Law and alterations to the vowel system. The PIE root is *seh₂g-, which is also the source of Latin *sāgīre* ('to be keen-nosed') and Hittite *sākizzi* ('gives a sign').\n\n### From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic\n\nThe PIE form *seh₂gieti evolved into Proto-Germanic **\\*sōkīþi** ('(s)he seeks'). This reconstruction is based on the infinitive form **\\*sōkijaną** ('to seek'). The step-by-step phonetic development is as follows:\n\n1.  **PIE \\*s- → Proto-Germanic \\*s-**: The initial 's' sound remained unchanged.\n2.  **PIE \\*-eh₂- → Proto-Germanic \\*-ō-**: The vowel *e* followed by the laryngeal *h₂* typically becomes a long *ā* in pre-Germanic, which then shifts to a long *ō* in Proto-Germanic. This accounts for the change in the root vowel.\n3.  **PIE \\*-g- → Proto-Germanic \\*-k-**: According to Grimm's Law, voiceless stops in PIE become voiceless fricatives, and voiced stops become voiceless stops. Therefore, the voiced velar stop *g* becomes the voiceless velar stop *k*.\n4.  **PIE \\*-ieti → Proto-Germanic \\*-īþi**: The thematic present suffix *-ieti* (third-person singular) develops into the Proto-Germanic weak verb class 1 ending *-īþi*. The *y* (*-j-*) causes the palatalization or \"i-umlaut\" of the preceding vowel where applicable and is a characteristic of this verb class. The final element *-ti* undergoes Grimm's Law, where *t* becomes the voiceless dental fricative *þ*.\n\nThus, PIE *seh₂gieti becomes Proto-Germanic **\\*sōkīþi**.\n\n### Reflexes in Old Germanic Languages\n\nThe Proto-Germanic verb *\\*sōkijaną* gives us the following cognates in Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German, all meaning 'to seek'.\n\n*   **Old Norse**: **sǿkja** (also spelled *sœkja* or *sækja*). The third-person singular present indicative form would be *sǿkir*.\n*   **Old English**: **sēcan** (also spelled *sœ̄ċan*). The third-person singular present indicative is *sēceþ* or *sēcþ*. The modern English word \"seek\" is its direct descendant, though its form was influenced by the Old Norse cognate.\n*   **Old High German**: **suohhen** (also spelled *suochen*). The modern German verb \"suchen\" derives from this form.\n\nThese verbs are all part of the same etymological family, descending from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *\\*sōkijaną* and, ultimately, from the PIE root *seh₂g-.\n\n<<<The PIE verb *seh₂gieti gives us the following reflexes:\n*   **Proto-Germanic**: **\\*sōkīþi** ('(s)he seeks'), from the infinitive **\\*sōkijaną**.\n*   **Old Norse**: **sǿkja** (or **sœkja**).\n*   **Old English**: **sēcan**.\n*   **Old High German**: **suohhen**.>>>"
