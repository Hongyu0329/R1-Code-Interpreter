    "The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is primarily determined by the amino acid sequence within its heptad repeats, specifically the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions which form the hydrophobic core. By analyzing the likely phasing of the heptad repeat for each sequence, we can predict their oligomeric states based on established principles.\n\nThe general rules for oligomerization based on the 'a' and 'd' core positions are as follows:\n*   **Dimer (2-helix):** Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Leucine (L) at 'd'. A combination of Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Alanine (A) at 'd' also strongly favors dimers.\n*   **Trimer (3-helix):** Isoleucine (I) at both 'a' and 'd' positions is a classic motif for trimers. Threonine (T) at the 'd' position is also known to specify trimers.\n*   **Tetramer (4-helix):** Leucine (L) at 'a' and Isoleucine (I) at 'd' promotes tetramer formation. Polar residues like Glutamine (Q) in the 'd' position are also strong indicators of tetramers.\n\nBased on these rules, the oligomeric states of the given sequences are analyzed as:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** The most plausible heptad repeat phasing places Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and Alanine (A) at the 'd' positions. This `a=I, d=A` pattern is characteristic of a **dimer**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** The core positions are predominantly Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Leucine (L) at 'd'. This `a=I, d=L` combination is the canonical motif for a **dimer**. The single Asparagine (N) at an 'a' position can sometimes influence oligomerization but is unlikely to change the state from the strongly dimeric background.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** Analysis of the hydrophobic residues indicates a phasing where both 'a' and 'd' positions are occupied by Isoleucine (I). The `a=I, d=I` core is a well-established motif for a **trimer**.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** In this sequence, the 'a' positions are occupied by Isoleucine (I), while the 'd' positions contain polar Glutamine (Q) and a bulky Tryptophan (W). The presence of Glutamine at the 'd' position is a strong indicator for **tetramer** formation.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** This sequence has Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and the polar residue Threonine (T) at the 'd' positions. Studies have shown that having Threonine at the 'd' position specifies a **trimer**.\n\nTherefore, the predicted sequence of oligomeric states is 2, 2, 3, 4, and 3. Comparing this to the provided options, none of them perfectly match this scientifically derived sequence. However, if there is an error in the question's provided options and we re-evaluate, option D offers the closest, albeit flawed, alternative. A search of a protein modeling software's source code reveals a basis set where sequences highly similar to those in the prompt are used as references: sequence 2 is listed as a dimer, sequence 3 as a trimer, and sequence 1 as a heptamer (7). This external data suggests the states could be 7, 2, and 3 for the first three sequences, respectively. This aligns with option B for the first three entries (7, 2, 3), but this option's prediction for the last two sequences (4, 5) does not align with established chemical principles.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between established biochemical rules and the provided answer choices, it's possible there is an error in the question or options. Based purely on the well-documented rules of coiled-coil oligomerization, none of the answers are correct. However, if forced to choose the best fit based on a partial match from external software documentation, the answer would start with 7, 2, 3.\n\n<<<I don't know"
