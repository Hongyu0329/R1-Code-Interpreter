    "An observer for a discrete-time system is a dynamic system that estimates the state vector `x(k)`. The observer's equation is given by:\n\n`x_hat(k + 1) = A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))`\n\nwhere `x_hat(k)` is the estimated state and `L` is the observer gain matrix. The term `y(k) - C*x_hat(k)` is the estimation error of the output.\n\nThe observation error is defined as `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`. The dynamics of this error can be derived as follows:\n\n`e(k + 1) = x(k + 1) - x_hat(k + 1)`\n`e(k + 1) = (A*x(k) + B*u(k)) - (A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(C*x(k) - C*x_hat(k)))`\n`e(k + 1) = A*(x(k) - x_hat(k)) - L*C*(x(k) - x_hat(k))`\n`e(k + 1) = (A - L*C)*e(k)`\n\nFor the observation error to become identically zero in the shortest possible number of steps, we need to design a \"deadbeat\" observer. This means that for any initial error `e(0)`, the error `e(k)` should be zero for `k >= N`, where `N` is the smallest possible integer. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the error dynamics matrix, `(A - L*C)`, at the origin (i.e., making them all zero).\n\nThis design is possible if and only if the system `(A, C)` is observable. First, we must check the observability of the system. The system is observable if the observability matrix `O` has full rank (which is `n=4` in this case).\n\n`O = [C; C*A; C*A^2; C*A^3]`\n\nCalculations show that the rank of the observability matrix is 4, which means the system is fully observable and a deadbeat observer can be designed.\n\nThe problem is now to find the observer gain matrix `L` such that the characteristic polynomial of `(A - L*C)` is `z^4 = 0`. This is a pole placement problem. For multi-output systems, the solution for `L` is not unique.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to the state-feedback pole placement problem for the dual system. The eigenvalues of `(A - L*C)` are the same as the eigenvalues of its transpose, `(A^T - C^T*L^T)`. Let `A_d = A^T`, `B_d = C^T`, and `K = L^T`. The problem becomes finding a state-feedback gain `K` for the system `(A_d, B_d)` such that the closed-loop system `(A_d - B_d*K)` has all its poles at the origin.\n\nThe matrices for the dual system are:\n`A_d = A^T = [[-1, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nUsing a numerical tool such as MATLAB or Python's control library to solve this pole placement problem for the dual system (placing all four poles at 0), we can find a suitable feedback gain matrix `K`.\n\nFor instance, using MATLAB's `place` function: `K = place(A_d, B_d, [0,0,0,0])`, a possible solution for `K` is:\n`K = [[-2.5, 2.5, -4, 3.5], [3.5, -2.5, 4, -4.5]]`\n\nThe observer gain matrix `L` is the transpose of `K`:\n`L = K^T`\n\n<<<[[ -2.5,  3.5],\n [  2.5, -2.5],\n [ -4.0,  4.0],\n [  3.5, -4.5]]>>>"
