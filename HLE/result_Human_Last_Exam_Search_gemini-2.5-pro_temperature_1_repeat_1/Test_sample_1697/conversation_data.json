    "The search results confirm the initial analysis. The reaction described is a classic example of Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM).\n\n1.  **Directed Metalation Group (DMG):** The reaction relies on a substituent on the aromatic ring, the DMG, which directs the deprotonation to the *ortho* position. The DMG, a Lewis basic group, coordinates to the Lewis acidic lithium ion of the organolithium reagent. This coordination brings the strong base into proximity with the *ortho* proton, leading to its selective removal. Both the tertiary amide (`-CONEt2`) and the tertiary amine (`-NMe2`) are effective DMGs.\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity with Multiple DMGs:** The starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, has two DMGs: the amide at position 1 and the dimethylamino group at position 3.\n    *   The `-CONEt2` group is one of the most powerful DMGs and directs lithiation to the C2 and C6 positions.\n    *   The `-NMe2` group is a moderate DMG and directs lithiation to the C2 and C4 positions.\n    *   Since both groups direct to the C2 position, this site is cooperatively activated, making its proton the most acidic on the ring. Therefore, lithiation with sec-BuLi/TMEDA will occur regioselectively at the C2 position. The use of sec-BuLi in combination with the chelating agent TMEDA creates a highly reactive and basic system, ideal for such deprotonations.\n\n3.  **Electrophilic Quench:** The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. It reacts with the added electrophile, methyl iodide (`CH3I`), to form a new carbon-carbon bond. The lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group.\n\nTherefore, the final product is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Reaction Scheme:**\n\n1.  **Step 1 (Directed ortho-Metalation):** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF. The strong base deprotonates the ring at the position *ortho* to the powerful amide directing group and *meta* to the dimethylamino group, which is the C2 position. This forms N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n2.  **Step 2 (Alkylation):** The aryllithium intermediate is then treated with methyl iodide. The nucleophilic carbon at C2 attacks the methyl group of the methyl iodide, displacing the iodide and forming the methylated product.\n\nThe final obtained compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
