    "The surname of the English poet that appears in the Russian translation of an essay describing the wide boulevards of Vienna is **Hogg**.\n\nThe essay in question is \"Less Than One\" (\"Меньше единицы\") by the Russian-American poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987. Brodsky originally wrote the essay in English, and it was later translated into Russian.\n\nIn the essay, Brodsky describes the vast, wide-open avenues of his native Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), comparing their scale to that of Vienna's boulevards. He reflects on the immense, empty spaces and their \"acoustic infinity.\" It is in the Russian version of this passage that the wordplay occurs. The description of vastness and acoustic properties evokes the concept of an echo.\n\nThe Russian word for \"echo\" is \"эхо\" (pronounced *ekho*). This word is phonetically very similar to the Russian transcription of the surname of the Scottish poet James Hogg (1770–1835), which is \"Хогг\" (pronounced *Khogg*). The pun lies in this acoustic and phonetic resemblance.\n\n<<<Hogg>>>"
