    "The number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, is 39.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how this number is determined:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Structure of Q_128**: The generalized quaternion group of order 128 has a presentation given by <x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, x³² = y², yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹>. This group consists of 128 elements, which can be divided into two types:\n    *   Elements of the form xⁱ, where i ranges from 0 to 63. These form a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n    *   Elements of the form xⁱy, where i ranges from 0 to 63.\n\n2.  **Cyclic Subgroups from the Cyclic Subgroup of Order 64**: A \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. The number of distinct cyclic subgroups of a cyclic group of order *n* is equal to the number of divisors of *n*. In this case, the cyclic subgroup <x> has order 64. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Therefore, there are 7 power subgroups contained within <x>. These are the subgroups generated by x⁶⁴ (the trivial group), x³², x¹⁶, x⁸, x⁴, x², and x.\n\n3.  **Cyclic Subgroups from the Remaining Elements**: The other 64 elements of Q_128 are of the form xⁱy. Let's determine the order of these elements and the number of distinct subgroups they generate.\n    *   The order of an element of the form xⁱy is 4. This is because (xⁱy)² = xⁱyxⁱy = xⁱ(yxⁱy⁻¹)y² = xⁱ(x⁻ⁱ)y² = y² = x³². Since x³² has order 2, (xⁱy)⁴ = (x³²)² = x⁶⁴ = 1.\n    *   Each of these 64 elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n    *   We need to count how many of these subgroups are distinct. A cyclic subgroup of order 4 generated by an element *g* is {e, g, g², g³}. The subgroup generated by xⁱy is {e, xⁱy, x³², x³²⁺ⁱy}.\n    *   Two elements, xⁱy and xʲy, generate the same subgroup if and only if j ≡ i (mod 64) or j ≡ i + 32 (mod 64). This means that for each i, the elements xⁱy and xⁱ⁺³²y generate the same subgroup.\n    *   Since these 64 elements pair up to generate the same subgroup, there are 64 / 2 = 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by the elements of the form xⁱy.\n\n4.  **Total Number of Power Subgroups**: The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the distinct cyclic subgroups from both sets of elements. These two sets of subgroups are disjoint (except for the trivial subgroup), as the subgroups of the second type contain elements not in the cyclic subgroup <x>.\n\n    Total number of power subgroups = (Number of cyclic subgroups from <x>) + (Number of distinct cyclic subgroups from elements xⁱy)\n    Total = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
