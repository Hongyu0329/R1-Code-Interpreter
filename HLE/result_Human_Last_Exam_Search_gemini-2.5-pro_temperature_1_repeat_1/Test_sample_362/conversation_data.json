    "The Wittig reaction is a process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. The general principle involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a phosphorus ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). In this specific case, the reactants are:\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **The Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, which has the structure PPh₃=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O) is exchanged with the carbon group of the ylide that is double-bonded to phosphorus.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n1.  The nucleophilic carbon of the ylide attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the pivalaldehyde.\n2.  This forms a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane.\n3.  This intermediate then decomposes to form the final alkene product and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\nThe resulting product is formed by creating a new double bond between the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde and the ylide's nucleophilic carbon. This leads to the formation of **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nRegarding the stereochemistry of the double bond, the nature of the ylide is important. The ylide in this reaction, PPh₃=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), is considered a **non-stabilized ylide** because there are no electron-withdrawing groups to stabilize the negative charge on the carbon atom. Wittig reactions involving non-stabilized ylides typically favor the formation of the **(Z)-alkene** (cis isomer).\n\nTherefore, the major product of the reaction is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**"
