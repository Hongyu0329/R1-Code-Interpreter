    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we must first analyze the flag's design and then understand its representation as a matrix.\n\n### The Structure of the Tongan Flag\n\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. Within this white canton, there is a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton). For the purpose of this problem, the flag is composed of two colors: red and white.\n\n### Matrix Representation\n\nWe can model the flag as a matrix where each red pixel is assigned a value of *a* and each white pixel is assigned a value of *b*. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns it contains. To find the maximal rank, we can choose the values of *a* and *b* strategically.\n\n### Analysis of the Matrix's Rows\n\nLet's analyze the different types of rows that can appear in this matrix:\n\n1.  **Rows in the red field:** Any row that is located entirely outside the canton (below it) will consist only of red pixels. Therefore, every entry in such a row will be *a*. Let's call this type of row vector **v₁ = (a, a, a, ... , a)**.\n\n2.  **Rows within the horizontal bar of the cross:** Any row that intersects the horizontal bar of the red cross within the canton will also be composed entirely of the value *a*. This is because the pixels to the left and right of the canton are in the red field, and the pixels within the canton are part of the red cross. Thus, these rows are also of the type **v₁**.\n\n3.  **Rows within the white part of the canton:** Any row that passes through the canton but not through the horizontal bar of the cross will have a different structure. These rows will contain:\n    *   The value *b* for pixels in the white background of the canton.\n    *   The value *a* for pixels corresponding to the vertical bar of the red cross.\n    *   The value *a* for all pixels outside the canton (in the red field to the right).\n    All rows of this type will be identical to each other. Let's call this vector **v₂**.\n\nSince the entire matrix is composed of only these two distinct types of row vectors (**v₁** and **v₂**), the row space of the matrix is spanned by these two vectors. The rank of the matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by {**v₁**, **v₂**}.\n\n### Determining the Maximal Rank\n\nThe dimension of the space spanned by two vectors can be at most 2. The rank will be exactly 2 if the vectors **v₁** and **v₂** are linearly independent.\n\n*   **v₁** = (a, a, a, ... , a)\n*   **v₂** is a vector containing both *a* and *b* values (assuming the cross and canton are properly resolved in the image).\n\nFor **v₁** and **v₂** to be linearly dependent, one must be a scalar multiple of the other. If we assume **v₂** = k * **v₁** for some scalar k, this would mean all entries of **v₂** must be k times the corresponding entries of **v₁**. This leads to two conditions:\n*   a = k * a\n*   b = k * a\n\nIf we choose *a* to be non-zero (a ≠ 0), the first equation gives k = 1. Substituting this into the second equation gives b = a.\n\nThis means that if *a* is not equal to *b*, the vectors **v₁** and **v₂** are linearly independent. For example, if we choose *a* = 1 and *b* = 2, it is impossible to find a scalar *k* such that **v₂** = k * **v₁**.\n\nTherefore, by choosing any two distinct values for *a* and *b* (where a ≠ 0), we ensure that the two unique row types are linearly independent. This results in a matrix with a rank of 2. Since the rank cannot be higher than the number of unique row types, the maximal possible rank is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
