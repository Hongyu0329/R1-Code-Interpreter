  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To determine the maximum length of the secret message, we must first understand the encoding system.\n\n1.  **Determine the number of unique encoding symbols:** The symbols in the *Ching* are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n    *   \"Yinyang\" consists of two states: yin and yang.\n    *   \"Wuxing\" refers to the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.\n    *   The total number of unique symbols is the product of these possibilities: 2 (yin/yang) × 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of symbols needed per character:** The secret message is written using an alphabet of 120 unique characters from the *Shu*. We need to find the number of *Ching* symbols (`k`) required to represent one of these 120 characters. This can be expressed as:\n    10^k ≥ 120\n    *   If k=1, 10¹ = 10, which is not enough to represent 120 characters.\n    *   If k=2, 10² = 100, which is still not enough.\n    *   If k=3, 10³ = 1000, which is sufficient to represent all 120 characters.\n    Therefore, a sequence of 3 yinyang-wuxing symbols is required to encode one character of the message.\n\n3.  **Calculate the maximum message length:** The *Ching* contains a total of 9999 symbols. Since each character of the message requires 3 symbols, the maximum length of the message is:\n    Maximum Length = Total Symbols / Symbols per Character\n    Maximum Length = 9999 / 3 = 3333\n\nThe information regarding the computer vision recognition time and computation speeds is not relevant to the calculation of the message's length.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
