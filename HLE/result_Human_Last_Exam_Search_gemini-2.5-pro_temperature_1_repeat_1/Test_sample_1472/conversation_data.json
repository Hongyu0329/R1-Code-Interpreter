    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The most well-characterized species in the solid state is bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II), typically as a bis(tetrafluoroborate) salt, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂](BF₄)₂.\n\nBased on single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies, the copper(II) complex has a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. The central copper atom is coordinated to the four sulfur atoms from the two bidentate 2,5-dithiahexane ligands in the equatorial plane. The two axial positions are occupied by fluorine atoms from the tetrafluoroborate counter-ions.\n\nThe crystal structure was determined to be in the monoclinic space group *P*2₁/c, which is a centrosymmetric space group. With two formula units per unit cell (Z=2), the copper atom must occupy a special position that is a crystallographic center of inversion. This means that the molecule itself is centrosymmetric. A molecule that contains a center of inversion (*i*) as its only non-identity symmetry element belongs to the **Cᵢ** point group.\n\nFor the copper(I) complex, bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I), the geometry is typically a distorted tetrahedron, which would result in a different, non-centrosymmetric point group. However, without specific structural details for the isolated copper(I) molecule, and given the detailed crystallographic data for the copper(II) species, the most definitive assignment can be made for the latter.\n\nTherefore, for the well-characterized bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, the point group is Cᵢ.\n\n<<<Cᵢ>>>"
