The expression for the Electrical double-layer potential distribution $\psi(y)$ is given by:
$$
\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\sinh(k(H-y))}{\sinh(kH)}
$$
where:
*   $y$ is the vertical coordinate from the bottom surface of the microchannel.
*   $H$ is the height of the microchannel.
*   $z_1$ is the slip-independent zeta potential of the bottom surface.
*   $\beta$ is the slip length.
*   $k$ is the Debye-HÃ¼ckel parameter.
