    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Recurrence Relation\nThe sequence is defined by the linear recurrence relation $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$ for $n\\geq 4$.\nThe characteristic equation of this recurrence is $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$.\nWe seek to find the roots of this polynomial. We can try to factor it into two quadratic polynomials:\n$(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (d+b+ac)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd$.\nComparing the coefficients with $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$:\n1.  $a+c = 0 \\implies c=-a$\n2.  $d+b+ac = d+b-a^2 = 0 \\implies d+b = a^2$\n3.  $ad+bc = ad-ab = a(d-b) = -88$\n4.  $bd = -57$\n\nFrom (2) and (3), we have $d+b=a^2$ and $d-b=-88/a$.\nSolving for $b$ and $d$:\n$2d = a^2 - 88/a$\n$2b = a^2 + 88/a$\nMultiplying these two equations gives $4bd = (a^2 - 88/a)(a^2 + 88/a) = a^4 - (88/a)^2$.\nSubstituting $bd=-57$:\n$4(-57) = a^4 - 7744/a^2$\n$-228 = a^4 - 7744/a^2$\nMultiplying by $a^2$ and rearranging gives a cubic equation in $y=a^2$:\n$a^6 + 228a^2 - 7744 = 0$\n$y^3 + 228y - 7744 = 0$\nBy the rational root theorem, we can test integer divisors of 7744. We find that $y=16$ is a root:\n$16^3 + 228(16) - 7744 = 4096 + 3648 - 7744 = 7744 - 7744 = 0$.\nSo, $a^2=16$, which means $a=4$ (we can choose the positive root without loss of generality).\nIf $a=4$:\n$c = -4$\n$d+b = 4^2 = 16$\n$d-b = -88/4 = -22$\nSolving this system gives $2d = -6 \\implies d=-3$ and $2b=38 \\implies b=19$.\nThis is consistent with $bd = (19)(-3) = -57$.\n\nSo, the characteristic equation factors as $(x^2 + 4x + 19)(x^2 - 4x - 3) = 0$.\nThe roots are found by solving the two quadratic equations:\n-   $x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4(1)(-3)}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{28}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n-   $x^2 + 4x + 19 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4(1)(19)}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-60}}{2} = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\n\nThe four roots are $r_1 = 2+\\sqrt{7}$, $r_2 = 2-\\sqrt{7}$, $r_3 = -2+i\\sqrt{15}$, and $r_4 = -2-i\\sqrt{15}$.\nThe general solution for $a_n$ is $a_n = C_1 r_1^n + C_2 r_2^n + C_3 r_3^n + C_4 r_4^n$.\n\n### 2. Asymptotic Behavior of $a_n$\nThe long-term behavior of $a_n$ is determined by the root with the largest absolute value. Let's calculate the magnitudes:\n-   $|r_1| = |2+\\sqrt{7}| \\approx 2 + 2.646 = 4.646$\n-   $|r_2| = |2-\\sqrt{7}| \\approx |2 - 2.646| = 0.646$\n-   $|r_3| = |r_4| = |-2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (\\sqrt{15})^2} = \\sqrt{4+15} = \\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.359$\n\nThe dominant root is $r = r_1 = 2+\\sqrt{7}$.\nFor large $n$, $a_n \\approx C_1 (2+\\sqrt{7})^n$, provided that the constant $C_1$ is not zero. Given the initial conditions, it can be verified that $C_1 \\neq 0$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Sum $s_n$\n$s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}(a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5})$\nWe need to find the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Let's analyze the dominant terms in the sums.\nLet $r = 2+\\sqrt{7}$.\n-   The term $a_{2k-3}$ behaves like $C_1 r^{2k-3}$. The sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3}$ will be dominated by its last term, and its growth is of the order $r^{2n}$.\n-   The terms $a_{k+100}$ and $a_{k+51}$ behave like $r^{k+100}$ and $r^{k+51}$. Their sums grow of the order $r^n$.\n-   In the second sum, a generic term like $a_{k+i}a_{k+j}$ behaves like $(r^k)^2 = r^{2k}$. This sum's growth is of the order $r^{2(n-1)} = r^{2n-2}$.\n\nThe term $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3}$ grows as $r^{2n}$, which is faster than the other terms.\nMore precisely, the sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3}$ is a geometric-like series dominated by the last term, so its sum is proportional to $a_{2n-3} \\approx C_1 r^{2n-3}$.\nThe second sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} (\\dots)$ is dominated by its last term, which involves products like $a_{n}a_{n-3} \\approx (C_1 r^n)(C_1 r^{n-3}) = C_1^2 r^{2n-3}$. However, the indices in the sum are up to $n-1$, so the last term is approximately $a_n a_{n-3}$ which is of order $r^{2(n-1)}=r^{2n-2}$.\nA closer look at the indices shows the dominant term in the second sum, $E_k$, for large $k$ behaves as $a_{k+3}a_{k-4} \\approx C_1^2 r^{2k-1}$. The sum $\\sum E_k$ behaves like its last term $E_{n-1}$, which is of order $r^{2(n-1)-1} = r^{2n-3}$.\nThe dominant term in the first sum comes from $a_{2n-3}$ which is of order $r^{2n-3}$. The terms $a_{n+100}$ and $a_{n+51}$ are of order $r^n$, thus negligible.\nSo, $s_n$ is dominated by the sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3}$. The sum is approximately $\\frac{a_{2n-3}}{1-1/r^2}$ which is proportional to $r^{2n-3}$.\nTherefore, for large $n$, $s_n \\approx K \\cdot r^{2n-3}$ for some constant $K$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Limit\nWe want to find the limit $L = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$.\nUsing the asymptotic behavior $s_n \\approx K \\cdot r^{2n-3}$:\n$\\ln(s_n) \\approx \\ln(K \\cdot r^{2n-3}) = \\ln(K) + (2n-3)\\ln(r)$.\n$\\frac{\\ln(s_n)}{n} \\approx \\frac{\\ln(K)}{n} + \\frac{(2n-3)\\ln(r)}{n} = \\frac{\\ln(K)}{n} + (2 - \\frac{3}{n})\\ln(r)$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $\\frac{\\ln(K)}{n} \\to 0$ and $\\frac{3}{n} \\to 0$.\nSo, $L = 2\\ln(r) = 2\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nWe need to find the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot L = 10^4 \\cdot 2\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\nUsing a calculator:\n-   $\\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.64575131$\n-   $2+\\sqrt{7} \\approx 4.64575131$\n-   $\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7}) \\approx \\ln(4.64575131) \\approx 1.53604473$\n-   $2\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7}) \\approx 2 \\cdot 1.53604473 = 3.07208946$\n-   $10^4 \\cdot 3.07208946 = 30720.8946$\n\nThe integer part of this value is 30720.\n\n<<<30720>>>"
