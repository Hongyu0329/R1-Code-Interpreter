Yes, changing the amide group to a PEG group is likely to solve the precipitation problem. The insolubility of the probe is the most probable cause of the observed precipitation, and PEGylation is a widely recognized and effective method for increasing the water solubility and reducing the aggregation of hydrophobic small molecules, including fluorescent dyes.
