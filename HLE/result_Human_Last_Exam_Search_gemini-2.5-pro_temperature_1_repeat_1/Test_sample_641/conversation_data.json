    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, q) for odd q can be determined by identifying the conjugacy classes of involutions and the orders of their centralizers. For G = PSU(4, q) with q odd, there are two conjugacy classes of involutions. The total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\nThe order of the group G = PSU(4, q) is given by the formula:\n|PSU(4, q)| = q⁶(q² - 1)(q³ + 1)(q⁴ - 1) / gcd(4, q + 1)\n\nFor q = 997, which is odd and satisfies 997 ≡ 1 (mod 4), we have gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2.\nSo, |PSU(4, 997)| = 997⁶(997² - 1)(997³ + 1)(997⁴ - 1) / 2.\n\nThe two conjugacy classes of involutions in PSU(4, q) for odd q have centralizers whose orders lead to the following class sizes:\n\n1.  The first class of involutions gives a class size of:\n    `C₁ = q⁴(q² - q + 1)(q² + 1)`\n\n2.  The second class of involutions gives a class size of:\n    `C₂ = q⁴(q² - 1)(q³ + 1) / 2`\n\nThe total number of involutions is the sum `C₁ + C₂`. We can now substitute q = 997 into these formulas to find the number of involutions in PSU(4,997).\n\nLet `q = 997`:\n*   `q² = 997² = 994,009`\n*   `q³ = 997³ ≈ 9.91 x 10⁸`\n*   `q⁴ = 997⁴ ≈ 9.88 x 10¹¹`\n\nNow, we calculate the size of each class:\n*   `C₁ = 997⁴ * (997² - 997 + 1) * (997² + 1)`\n    `C₁ = 997⁴ * (994,009 - 997 + 1) * (994,009 + 1)`\n    `C₁ = 997⁴ * 993,013 * 994,010`\n    `C₁ = 975,319,808,484,433,722,014,130`\n\n*   `C₂ = (997⁴ * (997² - 1) * (997³ + 1)) / 2`\n    `C₂ = (997⁴ * (994,009 - 1) * (991,037,973 + 1)) / 2`\n    `C₂ = (997⁴ * 994,008 * 991,037,974) / 2`\n    `C₂ = 486,665,786,193,796,538,902,512`\n\nThe total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two classes:\nTotal Involutions = `C₁ + C₂`\nTotal Involutions = 975,319,808,484,433,722,014,130 + 486,665,786,193,796,538,902,512\nTotal Involutions = 1,461,985,594,678,230,260,916,642\n\n<<<1461985594678230260916642>>>"
