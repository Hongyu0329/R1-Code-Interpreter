    "The search for an Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus has not yielded a definitive match. Extensive searches have been conducted to identify a film that contains this specific sequence of events, but no such movie has been found among Academy Award-nominated films.\n\nIt is possible that the film in question was not Oscar-nominated, or that some details of the scene have been misremembered. For instance, the dialogue may be slightly different, or the mode of transport might not be a bus.\n\nSeveral Oscar-nominated films feature pivotal scenes on buses, such as \"The Sweet Hereafter\" (1997), which revolves around a tragic bus accident, and the short film \"Watu Wote: All of Us\" (2017), based on a true story of a bus attack in Kenya. Additionally, films like \"Little Miss Sunshine\" (2006) feature significant portions of their narrative on a bus. However, none of these films contain the specific \"thank you\" moment described in the query.\n\nSimilarly, there are films where the phrase \"thank you\" is a crucial plot point. In the recent thriller \"Don't Move\" (2024), the protagonist says \"thank you\" to her tormentor at the end, but this film has not been nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nWithout further or different details, it is not possible to identify the specific Oscar-nominated film the user is referencing.\n\n<<<I am unable to find an Oscar-nominated film that matches the description provided.>>>"
