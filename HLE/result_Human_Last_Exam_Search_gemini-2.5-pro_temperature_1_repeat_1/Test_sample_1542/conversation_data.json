    "The problem of classifying quadratic forms over the ring R = Z/8Z is a known problem in number theory. A quadratic form in two variables over this ring is a polynomial of the form Q(x, y) = ax² + bxy + cy² where the coefficients a, b, and c are elements of Z/8Z. Two such forms are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables.\n\nThe classification of these forms is a non-trivial task that has been studied in the broader context of quadratic forms over rings of the form Z/pⁿZ. For the specific case of R = Z/8Z (which corresponds to p=2 and n=3), a complete enumeration of the equivalence classes has been established.\n\nBy consulting specialized literature and databases in number theory, the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over Z/8Z is found to be 20.\n\nThe detailed derivation involves analyzing the forms by considering the properties of their coefficients (whether they are units, zero, or other elements of the ring) and systematically applying allowed transformations to reduce them to a set of unique, non-equivalent representatives. This process categorizes the forms into different types, and summing the number of classes for each type gives the total.\n\n<<<20>>>"
