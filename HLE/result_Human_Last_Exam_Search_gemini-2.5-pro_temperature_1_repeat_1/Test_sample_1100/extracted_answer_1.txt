The diet provides a natural source of L-DOPA and tyrosine, which are precursors for the neurotransmitter dopamine, and tyrosine is also essential for thyroid hormone production. This helps to counteract the side effects of the antipsychotic medication and the hormonal deficiencies caused by Sheehan's Syndrome. Additionally, the diet can provide necessary sodium to correct the hyponatremia associated with adrenal insufficiency, another consequence of Sheehan's.
