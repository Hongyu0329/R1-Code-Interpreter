    "The product of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is the rationale for this outcome:\nThe reaction is an E2 elimination, which requires a specific three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms. The hydrogen atom that is removed and the bromine leaving group must be in an *anti-periplanar* position. In the context of a cyclohexane ring, this means both the hydrogen and the bromine must be in axial positions on adjacent carbons, oriented in opposite directions (one pointing up, the other down).\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry of the Reactant**: The starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *trans* isomer, meaning the bromine and methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring.\n\n2.  **Conformational Analysis**: For the E2 reaction to proceed, the cyclohexane ring must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position. In the *trans* isomer, when the bromine is forced into an axial position, the methyl group on the adjacent carbon is also forced into an axial position. This is a less stable conformation, but it is the only one that can undergo the E2 reaction.\n\n3.  **Elimination Pathway**:\n    *   **Zaitsev Product (1-methylcyclohexene)**: Formation of this more substituted alkene would require the removal of the hydrogen atom from the same carbon that the methyl group is attached to (C2). However, in the reactive conformation, the methyl group is axial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, and therefore, this elimination cannot occur.\n    *   **Hofmann-type Product (3-methylcyclohexene)**: The other adjacent carbon (C6) has an axial hydrogen. This hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine atom. The strong base, potassium tert-butoxide, will abstract this proton, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\nDue to the strict stereochemical requirements of the E2 mechanism, the reaction is forced to form the less substituted alkene, 3-methylcyclohexene, making it the major product. This is a classic example where the stereochemistry of the substrate dictates the regioselectivity of the elimination, overriding Zaitsev's rule which would normally favor the most substituted alkene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
