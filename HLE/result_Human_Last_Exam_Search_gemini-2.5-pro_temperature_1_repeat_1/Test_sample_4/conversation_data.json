    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first determine its structure and then compute its cohomology Betti numbers. The Poincaré polynomial is the generating function of these numbers.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. We can analyze its structure as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a}$, where $\\mathfrak{a} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal. The action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{a}$ is given by the adjoint representation.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial $P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers. For a semi-direct product of this form, where the acting algebra is one-dimensional and the action is nilpotent, the Poincaré polynomial can be computed via the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, which degenerates at the $E_2$ page. This leads to the formula:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1+x) C(x)$,\nwhere $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^5 c_k x^k$ is the generating function for the dimensions $c_k = \\dim(\\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{a}^*))^{e_1}$ of the $e_1$-invariant elements in the exterior algebra of the dual space of $\\mathfrak{a}$.\n\nThe action of $e_1$ on the dual space $\\mathfrak{a}^* = \\text{span}\\{e^2, e^3, e^4, e^5, e^6\\}$ is determined by the Lie brackets. The non-zero actions are:\n$e_1 \\cdot e^3 = -e^2$\n$e_1 \\cdot e^4 = -e^3$\n$e_1 \\cdot e^6 = -e^5$\n\nThe space $\\mathfrak{a}^*$ decomposes into a direct sum of two invariant subspaces, $V_1 = \\text{span}\\{e^2, e^3, e^4\\}$ and $V_2 = \\text{span}\\{e^5, e^6\\}$. The generating polynomial of invariant dimensions is multiplicative over such a direct sum, so $C(x) = C_{V_1}(x) C_{V_2}(x)$.\n\n1.  **Invariants on $\\Lambda(V_1)$**: The action on $V_1$ is $e_1 \\cdot e^2 = 0$, $e_1 \\cdot e^3 = -e^2$, $e_1 \\cdot e^4 = -e^3$.\n    *   $\\dim(\\Lambda^0(V_1))^{e_1} = 1$ (the scalars).\n    *   $\\dim(\\Lambda^1(V_1))^{e_1} = 1$ (spanned by $e^2$).\n    *   $\\dim(\\Lambda^2(V_1))^{e_1} = 1$ (spanned by $e^2 \\wedge e^3$).\n    *   $\\dim(\\Lambda^3(V_1))^{e_1} = 1$ (spanned by $e^2 \\wedge e^3 \\wedge e^4$).\n    Thus, $C_{V_1}(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3$.\n\n2.  **Invariants on $\\Lambda(V_2)$**: The action on $V_2$ is $e_1 \\cdot e^5 = 0$, $e_1 \\cdot e^6 = -e^5$.\n    *   $\\dim(\\Lambda^0(V_2))^{e_1} = 1$.\n    *   $\\dim(\\Lambda^1(V_2))^{e_1} = 1$ (spanned by $e^5$).\n    *   $\\dim(\\Lambda^2(V_2))^{e_1} = 1$ (spanned by $e^5 \\wedge e^6$).\n    Thus, $C_{V_2}(x) = 1 + x + x^2$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$C(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)(1 + x + x^2) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n\nFinally, the Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$ is:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1+x)(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 3x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThe Betti numbers are therefore $b_0=1$, $b_1=3$, $b_2=5$, $b_3=6$, $b_4=5$, $b_5=3$, and $b_6=1$. The symmetry of the coefficients ($b_k = b_{6-k}$) is a known property for unimodular nilpotent Lie algebras, which serves as a verification of the result.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
