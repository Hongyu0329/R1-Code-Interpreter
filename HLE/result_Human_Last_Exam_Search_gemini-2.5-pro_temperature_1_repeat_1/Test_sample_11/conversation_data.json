    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law.\n\nThis law, enacted in 1973, marked a significant shift in Israeli contract law, which had previously been based on English common law that did not have a comparable overarching principle. The Contracts (General Part) Law formally introduced the duty of good faith into the Israeli legal system, drawing inspiration from German civil law.\n\nThe statute addresses \"good faith\" in two key sections:\n*   **Section 12** mandates that parties act in good faith during the negotiation phase of a contract.\n*   **Section 39** requires that any right or obligation arising from a contract be exercised and fulfilled in good faith.\n\nThis principle of good faith has since become a cornerstone of Israeli private law, with courts applying it extensively. Its introduction through the Contracts (General Part) Law is considered a major innovation in the nation's legal framework.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
