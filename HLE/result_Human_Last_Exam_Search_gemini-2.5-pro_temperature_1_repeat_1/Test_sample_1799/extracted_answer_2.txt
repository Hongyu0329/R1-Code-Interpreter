It is a subject of ongoing debate, with compelling arguments on both sides. While it is possible to derive the constancy of a universal speed limit from the first postulate and general principles of homogeneity and isotropy, some argue this involves hidden assumptions. Therefore, it is not definitively true that the second postulate is entirely superfluous, though its relationship with the first is more intricate than that of two wholly independent axioms.
