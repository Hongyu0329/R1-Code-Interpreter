    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. At the time of her death, her husband John of Gaunt was overseas.\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, who was an esquire in the king's household by 1368, was also abroad in 1368 on a diplomatic mission. It is possible he attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti in Milan that year. The following year, in 1369, Chaucer was on military service in France.\n\nChaucer's poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" was written in honor of Blanche of Lancaster after her death.\n\nGiven that Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission abroad in 1368, it is unlikely he was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died. While his exact location on September 12, 1368, is not definitively known, the evidence points to him being in Europe, possibly in Italy or traveling for his diplomatic duties. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that his exact whereabouts are unknown, but he was not in England.\n\n<<<D>>>"
