    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning. Several sources define a clique as a subset of vertices where the induced subgraph is complete. This is the key definition. The search results in and discuss a related but different problem concerning the number of different *maximal* clique sizes, which is a more complex question. My problem is about *induced* cliques, not necessarily maximal ones. My initial line of reasoning stands.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology**:\n    *   A **clique** in a graph is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge.\n    *   An **induced subgraph** on a set of vertices `W` is a graph containing all vertices in `W` and *all* the edges from the original graph that connect pairs of vertices in `W`.\n    *   An **induced k-clique** is an induced subgraph that is a complete graph on `k` vertices (also known as K_k).\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Core of the Problem**: The question asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with 128 vertices. Let this number be `m`, and the different sizes be `s_1, s_2, ..., s_m`.\n\n3.  **The Key Insight**: Suppose a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k`. Let the set of vertices forming this clique be `C`. By definition, every pair of vertices in `C` is connected by an edge. Now, consider any subset `C'` of `C` with `j` vertices, where `1 <= j < k`. The subgraph induced by `C'` will also be a clique. This is because all vertices in `C'` are also in `C`, and since all vertices in `C` are mutually connected, all vertices in `C'` must be mutually connected as well. Therefore, if a graph has an induced clique of size `k`, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to `k`.\n\n4.  **Connecting to Clique Number**: This implies that the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any graph `G` is always of the form `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`, where `k_max` is the size of the largest induced clique in `G`. The size of the largest clique in a graph `G` is known as its **clique number**, denoted `ω(G)`. Thus, the number of different induced clique sizes is simply equal to the clique number of the graph.\n\n5.  **Maximizing the Number of Sizes**: To find the maximum possible number of different clique sizes, we need to find a graph `G` on 128 vertices that has the largest possible clique number `ω(G)`.\n\n6.  **Finding the Maximum Clique Number**: For any graph with `n` vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed `n`. Therefore, the clique number `ω(G)` must be less than or equal to `n`. For `n = 128`, we have `ω(G) <= 128`.\n\n7.  **Constructing the Optimal Graph**: The maximum possible clique number of 128 is achieved by the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_128`. In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\n8.  **Verification**: In the complete graph `K_128`, any subset of `k` vertices (for any `k` from 1 to 128) forms an induced clique of size `k`. Therefore, `K_128` has induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., 128. The total number of different sizes is 128.\n\nSince the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128, and we have found a graph that achieves this number, the maximum possible number is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
