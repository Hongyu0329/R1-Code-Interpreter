    "Of the rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, the three longest in terms of verifiable physical length or mythological significance are the Tiber, the Styx, and the Acheron.\n\nThe **Tiber River** is the longest river with a verifiable physical length mentioned in the *Aeneid*. It is the third-longest river in Italy, flowing for approximately 406 kilometers (252 miles). In the epic, the Tiber is of great significance as it is the river that flows through Latium, the destined homeland of Aeneas and his Trojan followers, and the future site of Rome. The river god, Tiberinus, appears to Aeneas in a dream to confirm he has reached his fated destination.\n\nThe other prominent rivers in the *Aeneid* are the rivers of the underworld, which are mythological and their lengths are not quantifiable in a literal sense. However, based on their importance and the descriptions within the epic and wider mythology, the Styx and the Acheron can be considered the next most significant, a proxy for their \"length\" in a symbolic context.\n\nThe **Styx** is the most renowned of the underworld rivers and is described as encircling the underworld nine times in the *Aeneid*. This description emphasizes its vastness and significance as the primary boundary between the world of the living and the dead. The souls of the dead must be ferried across the Styx by Charon. While there is a real stream and waterfall in Arcadia, Greece, associated with the mythological Styx, it does not have a significant length.\n\nThe **Acheron** is another major river of the underworld mentioned in the *Aeneid*, often depicted as the river the dead must cross to enter Hades. In some accounts, it is presented as a vast lake. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato even described the Acheron as the second greatest river in the world, surpassed only by Oceanus, highlighting its perceived immensity in the mythological imagination. A real river named Acheron exists in the Epirus region of Greece and is 52 kilometers (32 miles) long.\n\nOther rivers of the underworld mentioned in the *Aeneid* include:\n\n*   **Phlegethon**: A river of fire.\n*   **Cocytus**: A river of wailing.\n*   **Lethe**: The river of forgetfulness.\n\nThese mythological rivers are primarily symbolic and do not have verifiable lengths that can be compared to the Tiber. Therefore, the ranking of the three longest rivers relies on a combination of the Tiber's actual measurement and the mythological importance and described scale of the Styx and Acheron.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Tiber, the Styx, and the Acheron, with the Tiber being the only one with a significant, verifiable physical length, while the lengths of the mythological Styx and Acheron are understood through their vast symbolic importance in the epic.>>>"
