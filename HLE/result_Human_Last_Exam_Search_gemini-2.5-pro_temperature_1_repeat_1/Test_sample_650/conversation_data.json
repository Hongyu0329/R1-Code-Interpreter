    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we must analyze the number of elementary operations performed as a function of the input size.\n\n### Analysis of the Algorithm\n\nThe core of the algorithm is a `while` loop that executes as long as the variable `q` is greater than 0. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization (Before the loop):**\n    *   `i := 0`\n    *   `x := n`\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋` (which is `⌊n/c⌋`)\n    *   `a_0 := x - qc`\n    These are a fixed number of basic arithmetic operations (assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Assuming these operations on numbers of a certain size take a constant amount of time, this step is O(1).\n\n2.  **The `while` loop:**\n    The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The value of `q` is repeatedly updated by dividing it by `c`. Let's trace the value of `q` in each iteration:\n    *   Before the loop starts, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   After the 1st iteration, `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is approximately `n/c²`.\n    *   After the 2nd iteration, `q` becomes approximately `n/c³`.\n    *   After `k` iterations, `q` is approximately `n/c^(k+1)`.\n\n    The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n/c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1, or `n < c^(k+1)`. To find the number of iterations `k`, we can take the logarithm:\n\n    `log_c(n) < k + 1`\n\n    The number of iterations is therefore proportional to `log_c(n)`. This is the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`.\n\n3.  **Operations inside the loop:**\n    Each iteration of the loop consists of a fixed number of elementary operations:\n    *   `i := i + 1`\n    *   `x := q`\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`\n    *   `a_i := x - qc`\n    These are simple arithmetic operations. If we assume that the division and multiplication of the numbers involved take a time proportional to the number of bits in `n`, the analysis becomes more complex. However, in a standard model of computation where arithmetic operations on integers that fit within a machine's word size are considered O(1), the work inside the loop is constant.\n\n### Conclusion on Complexity\n\nThe total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the time taken per iteration.\n\n*   **Number of iterations:** Proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n*   **Work per iteration:** Constant, O(1).\n\nTherefore, the total time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log_c(n))`. In Big O notation, the base of the logarithm is not significant because `log_c(n) = log_2(n) / log_2(c)`, and `1/log_2(c)` is a constant factor. Thus, the complexity is typically expressed as `O(log n)`.\n\nIt is important to note that this analysis assumes that the arithmetic operations (division, multiplication) on numbers up to size `n` can be performed in constant time. For arbitrarily large numbers, the complexity of these operations themselves would need to be factored in, potentially leading to a higher complexity like `O(M(log n) * log n)`, where `M(k)` is the time for multiplication of k-bit numbers. However, for the typical analysis of such an algorithm in an introductory context, the `O(log n)` complexity is the standard answer.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
