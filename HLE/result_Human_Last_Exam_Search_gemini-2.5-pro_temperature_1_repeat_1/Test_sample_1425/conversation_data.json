    "<<<In the grand canonical ensemble, the partition function Z is defined as:\n\nZ = Tr[e<sup>-β(H - μN)</sup>]\n\nwhere:\n*   `Tr` is the trace over all states of the system.\n*   `β` is the inverse temperature, β = 1/(k<sub>B</sub>T).\n*   `H` is the Hamiltonian of the system.\n*   `μ` is the chemical potential.\n*   `N` is the particle number operator.\n\nThe user specifies that the Hamiltonian for the system is H = -μ<sub>0</sub>N, where we use μ<sub>0</sub> to distinguish it from the chemical potential μ of the ensemble. In many contexts, the question might imply that the entire operator in the exponent is simply -μN, which would correspond to a physical Hamiltonian H=0. We will proceed by taking the user's input literally, where the system's own Hamiltonian is H = -μ<sub>0</sub>N.\n\nSubstituting this into the grand canonical partition function expression, we get:\n\nZ = Tr[e<sup>-β(-μ<sub>0</sub>N - μN)</sup>] = Tr[e<sup>β(μ<sub>0</sub> + μ)N</sup>]\n\nTo express this using path integrals, we turn to the language of quantum field theory in imaginary time. The partition function can be written as a functional integral over fields ψ(x, τ), where x represents spatial coordinates and τ is the imaginary time variable, which runs from 0 to β.\n\nThe partition function Z is given by:\n\nZ = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] e<sup>-S[ψ*, ψ]</sup>\n\nThe term S[ψ*, ψ] is the Euclidean action. The general form for the Euclidean action in the grand canonical ensemble is:\n\nS = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫d<sup>d</sup>x [ ψ*(∂/∂τ)ψ + H(ψ*, ψ) - μN(ψ*, ψ) ]\n\nHere, H(ψ*, ψ) and N(ψ*, ψ) are the densities for the Hamiltonian and the particle number, respectively, expressed in terms of the fields. For the given Hamiltonian H = -μ<sub>0</sub>N, the Hamiltonian density is H(ψ*, ψ) = -μ<sub>0</sub>ψ*ψ, since the number density is N(ψ*, ψ) = ψ*ψ.\n\nSubstituting this into the action gives:\n\nS = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫d<sup>d</sup>x [ ψ*(∂/∂τ)ψ - μ<sub>0</sub>ψ*ψ - μψ*ψ ]\n\nCombining the terms involving the chemical potentials, we get:\n\nS = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫d<sup>d</sup>x [ ψ*(∂/∂τ - (μ<sub>0</sub> + μ))ψ ]\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z for a system with the Hamiltonian H = -μ<sub>0</sub>N in the grand canonical ensemble is given by the path integral:\n\n**Z = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] exp( -∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫d<sup>d</sup>x [ ψ*(x, τ)(∂/∂τ - (μ<sub>0</sub> + μ))ψ(x, τ) ] )**\n\nThe integration measure D[ψ*, ψ] signifies an integral over all possible configurations of the fields ψ* and ψ. The fields are subject to boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction:\n*   For **bosons**, the fields are periodic: ψ(x, 0) = ψ(x, β).\n*   For **fermions**, the fields are anti-periodic: ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β).\n\nIf the question is interpreted such that the physical Hamiltonian H is zero (a common scenario for certain theoretical models), then μ<sub>0</sub> = 0, and the expression simplifies to:\n\n**Z = ∫D[ψ*, ψ] exp( -∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫d<sup>d</sup>x [ ψ*(x, τ)(∂/∂τ - μ)ψ(x, τ) ] )**\n\nThis expression represents the partition function for a non-interacting gas where the particles have no kinetic or potential energy, and the thermodynamic properties are governed solely by the temperature and chemical potential.>>>"
