    "The user's query contains the undefined term `S = SNYWR`. My search did not yield a specific mathematical value for \"SNYWR\". The search results show \"snywr\" used in various contexts, including a possible typo in a customer review (\"Size s very big can't handle snywr\") and in old newspapers where the scanning might be imperfect. Without a concrete value for S, I cannot compute a final numerical answer.\n\nThe problem is a classic ambiguous case of the Law of Sines. For a triangle ABC, given side `a = BC = S`, side `b = AC`, and angle `B = 30°`, there are two possible triangles if and only if the length of side AC is greater than the altitude from C to the line containing AB, and less than the length of side BC.\n\nThe altitude `h` from vertex C to the side AB is given by `h = a * sin(B)`.\nGiven `a = S` and `B = 30°`, we have `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSo, `h = S * (1/2) = S / 2`.\n\nFor two possible values for side length AB, the length of AC must satisfy the inequality:\n`h < AC < a`\n`S / 2 < AC < S`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of AC that satisfy this condition. Let `x` be an integer representing the length of AC. We need to find the number of integers `x` in the interval `(S/2, S)`.\n\nThe integers are `floor(S/2) + 1`, `floor(S/2) + 2`, ..., `S - 1`.\nThe number of these integers is `(S - 1) - (floor(S/2) + 1) + 1 = S - 1 - floor(S/2)`.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n*   If `S` is an even number, let `S = 2k`. The number of integers is `(2k - 1) - k = k - 1 = S/2 - 1`.\n*   If `S` is an odd number, let `S = 2k + 1`. The number of integers is `(2k + 1 - 1) - k = k = (S - 1) / 2`.\n\nBoth cases can be summarized by the formula `ceil(S/2) - 1` or `floor((S-1)/2)`.\n\nSince the value of S is unknown, I cannot provide a final numerical answer. The user needs to provide the value for S.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of providing an example, that `S` was intended to be the current year, 2025.\nIf `S = 2025`:\nThe condition is `2025 / 2 < AC < 2025`, which is `1012.5 < AC < 2025`.\nThe integer values for AC would be from 1013 to 2024, inclusive.\nThe number of integer values is `2024 - 1013 + 1 = 1012`.\nUsing the formula for an odd `S`: `(2025 - 1) / 2 = 2024 / 2 = 1012`.\n\nHowever, as I cannot determine the value of S from the information given, I cannot give a definitive numerical answer. The query \"SNYWR\" is not a standard mathematical constant or a value that can be looked up.\n\nI will provide the formula for the user and indicate that the value of S is needed.\n\nTo solve the problem, we must establish the range of possible integer values for the side length `AC`. In triangle `ABC`, we are given `BC = S` and `m∠B = 30°`.\n\nFor there to be two possible values for the side length `AB`, we must be in the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines. This occurs when the length of the side opposite the given angle (in this case, `AC`) is greater than the altitude from vertex `C` to side `AB` but less than the length of the other given side (`BC`).\n\n1.  **Calculate the altitude (h) from C to the line containing AB.**\n    The altitude `h` is given by `h = BC * sin(B)`.\n    With `BC = S` and `B = 30°`, `sin(30°) = 0.5`.\n    So, `h = S * 0.5 = S / 2`.\n\n2.  **Establish the inequality for AC.**\n    For two possible triangles to exist, the length of `AC` must be strictly between the altitude `h` and the length of `BC`.\n    `h < AC < BC`\n    `S / 2 < AC < S`\n\n3.  **Count the number of integer values for AC.**\n    We need to find the number of integers in the interval `(S/2, S)`. The number of integers `x` that satisfy `S/2 < x < S` is given by the largest integer less than `S` minus the smallest integer greater than `S/2`, plus one.\n    *   The largest integer is `S - 1`.\n    *   The smallest integer is `floor(S/2) + 1`.\n    The number of integers is `(S - 1) - (floor(S/2) + 1) + 1 = S - 1 - floor(S/2)`.\n\n    Alternatively:\n    *   If `S` is even, say `S=2k`, the range is `k < AC < 2k`. The integer values are `k+1, ..., 2k-1`. The count is `(2k-1) - (k+1) + 1 = k-1 = S/2 - 1`.\n    *   If `S` is odd, say `S=2k+1`, the range is `k+0.5 < AC < 2k+1`. The integer values are `k+1, ..., 2k`. The count is `2k - (k+1) + 1 = k = (S-1)/2`.\n\nSince the value of `S=SNYWR` is not defined in the problem, a final numerical answer cannot be computed. If you provide a numerical value for `S`, I can complete the calculation.\n\n<<<The number of integer values for AC is `S - 1 - floor(S/2)`, which is equivalent to `S/2 - 1` if S is even, and `(S-1)/2` if S is odd. The value of S is not provided.>>>"
