    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a derivative of dehydrobenzoannulene, which has a triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself belongs to the D3h point group. The SMILES string indicates that three ethynyl groups are attached to the outer benzene rings in a symmetrical fashion.\n\nVisualizing the molecule reveals a planar structure with a high degree of symmetry. The key symmetry elements are:\n\n*   A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) that passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its plane.\n*   Three two-fold axes of rotation (C₂) that lie in the plane of the molecule, each passing through the center and bisecting the angles between the fused benzene rings.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) which is the plane of the molecule itself. The planar nature of the molecule means all atoms lie within this plane.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) that each contain the principal C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n*   An improper three-fold rotation axis (S₃).\n\nThe presence of a C₃ axis and three perpendicular C₂ axes indicates that the molecule belongs to the D₃ point group family. The additional presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) elevates the symmetry to D₃ₕ. The symmetric substitution of the ethynyl groups does not lower this symmetry. Therefore, the symmetry group of the molecule is D₃ₕ.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
