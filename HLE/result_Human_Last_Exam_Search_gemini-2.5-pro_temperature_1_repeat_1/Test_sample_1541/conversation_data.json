    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, followed by an analysis of its memory usage.\n\n### C Program\n\nThis program uses a counting sort approach, which is ideal for this problem because the set of numbers is very small (only 1, 2, 3, and 4). It reads the input character by character, avoiding the need to store the entire input string in memory. This makes it extremely memory-efficient.\n\nData types are chosen carefully to minimize memory footprint: `short` is used for counters as the maximum count (500) fits well within its range, and `char` is used for single characters and a simple flag.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program rearranges a given sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4)\n * into non-decreasing order.\n *\n * It employs a memory-efficient counting sort algorithm. Instead of\n * storing the entire input string, it reads character by character,\n * counting the occurrences of each number. Then, it constructs and\n * prints the sorted sum directly.\n */\nint main() {\n    // counts[0] for '1', counts[1] for '2', etc.\n    // The input string is at most 1000 chars, meaning at most 500 numbers.\n    // 'short' (typically 2 bytes) is sufficient to store these counts.\n    // Memory used: 4 * sizeof(short) = 8 bytes.\n    short counts[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n\n    // Variable to hold each character read from the input.\n    // Memory used: 1 * sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char c;\n\n    // Read the input character by character until a newline or end-of-file.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // We only need to count the numbers, so we ignore the '+' signs.\n        if (c != '+') {\n            // Convert character '1'-'4' to an array index 0-3.\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // A flag to determine if a '+' should be printed. A 'char' is the\n    // smallest data type suitable for a true/false flag.\n    // Memory used: 1 * sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char is_first_digit = 1;\n\n    // Loop counters. 'short' is sufficient as the loop ranges are small.\n    // Memory used for both i and j: 2 * sizeof(short) = 4 bytes.\n    short i, j;\n\n    // Print the numbers in sorted order (1s, then 2s, etc.).\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            // If this isn't the very first digit being printed,\n            // we must first print a '+' separator.\n            if (!is_first_digit) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            // Convert index 0-3 back to character '1'-'4' and print it.\n            putchar(i + '1');\n            // After the first digit, all subsequent ones must be preceded by '+'.\n            is_first_digit = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Print a final newline for clean output.\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory in bytes (`m`) used for the variables in this program is calculated as follows, assuming standard data type sizes (char: 1 byte, short: 2 bytes):\n\n*   **`counts[4]`**: An array of 4 `short` integers to store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   `4 * sizeof(short)` = 4 * 2 = **8 bytes**\n*   **`c`**: A `char` variable to read each character from the input stream.\n    *   `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**\n*   **`is_first_digit`**: A `char` variable used as a flag to handle the printing of the `+` symbol.\n    *   `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**\n*   **`i`**, **`j`**: `short` integer variables used as loop counters.\n    *   `2 * sizeof(short)` = 2 * 2 = **4 bytes**\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all variables:\nm = 8 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 14 bytes.\n\n<<<14>>>"
