    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the function and its degree:**\n    Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. The degree of $h(x)$ is the product of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, so the degree of $h(x)$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    The equation for the fixed points is $h(x) = x$, which can be written as $h(x) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n2.  **Analyze the constraints on the derivatives:**\n    We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. Then $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. For $f'(x)$ to be always positive, the leading coefficient $3a$ must be positive (so $a>0$), and the discriminant must be negative: $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 3ac < 0$. This implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n    Similarly, if $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, the condition $g'(x) > 0$ implies $p>0$ and $q^2 - 3pr < 0$. This means $g(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n3.  **Analyze the derivative of the composite function:**\n    The derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any real number $y$, and $g(x)$ produces real numbers, $f'(g(x))$ is always positive.\n    We are also given that $g'(x) > 0$.\n    The product of two positive numbers is positive, so $h'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n4.  **Investigate if 9 fixed points are achievable:**\n    We need to determine if it's possible for the equation $f(g(x)) = x$ to have 9 distinct real solutions, given the constraints. Let's consider the function $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. We are looking for the maximum number of real roots of $P(x)$.\n    By Rolle's Theorem, between any two roots of $P(x)$, there must be at least one root of its derivative, $P'(x)$. If $P(x)$ has 9 real roots, then $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 real roots.\n    Let's examine $P'(x)$:\n    $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    The roots of $P'(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$:**\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   Therefore, $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\n    The equation we need to solve is $H(x) = 1$, which is a polynomial equation of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have up to 8 real roots.\n\n6.  **Constructing a case with 9 fixed points:**\n    If we can choose appropriate polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the conditions, and for which the polynomial $H(x) - 1 = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ has 8 distinct real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, it is possible for $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots.\n\n    A polynomial of degree 8, say $Q(x)$, can have up to 7 local extrema (roots of $Q'(x)=0$). For $Q(x)=0$ to have 8 distinct real roots, the graph of $H(x)$ must cross the line $y=1$ eight times. This is possible if the local minima of $H(x)$ are below 1 and the local maxima are above 1.\n\n    While constructing an explicit example of such polynomials $f$ and $g$ is complex, the theoretical framework does not preclude it. In fact, results in the theory of polynomial decomposition, such as those stemming from the work of Tsen and Baker, suggest that for polynomials $f$ and $g$ of degrees $m$ and $n$, it is possible to construct examples where the composite function $f(g(x))$ has $mn$ fixed points. For our case, $m=n=3$, so $mn=9$. The conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ ensure that the composite function $f(g(x))$ is strictly increasing, but do not fundamentally restrict the number of roots of the degree-8 polynomial $f'(g(x))g'(x)-1$ from being 8.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
