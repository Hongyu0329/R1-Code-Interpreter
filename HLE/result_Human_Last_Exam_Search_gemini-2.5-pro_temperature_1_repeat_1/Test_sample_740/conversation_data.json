    "To determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we first analyze the equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, of the form u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x, y) u(y) dy, with f(x) = 1.\n\nThe kernel K(x, y) can be simplified by recognizing the formula for the sum of a geometric progression:\n(xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k.\n\nThe kernel is separable (or degenerate), meaning it can be written as a finite sum of products of functions of x and functions of y. Let's substitute this into the integral equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ [∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k] u(y) dy\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy\n\nLet's define the constants C_k as the moments of the function u(y):\nC_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy, for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nWith these constants, the solution u(x) must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most n-1:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) C_k x^(n-1-k)\n\nTo find the constants C_k, we substitute this expression for u(y) back into their definition:\nC_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) C_k y^(n-1-k)] dy\nC_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) C_k ∫₀¹ y^(j + n-1 - k) dy\nC_j = [y^(j+1) / (j+1)]₀¹ + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) C_k [y^(j + n - k) / (j + n - k)]₀¹\nC_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) C_k / (j + n - k)\n\nThis gives us a system of n linear equations for the n unknown constants C_0, C_1, ..., C_(n-1). We can write this in matrix form as:\nC = b + λMC\nwhere:\n*   C is the column vector [C₀, C₁, ..., C_(n-1)]ᵀ.\n*   b is the column vector [1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]ᵀ, with b_j = 1/(j+1).\n*   M is an n×n matrix with elements M_jk = 1 / (j + n - k), where j is the row index and k is the column index (from 0 to n-1).\n\nThe system can be rearranged as:\n(I - λM)C = b\n\nA unique solution for C exists if the determinant of the matrix (I - λM) is non-zero. If det(I - λM) = 0, the equation may have no solution or infinitely many solutions. This condition is equivalent to 1/λ being an eigenvalue of the matrix M. The values of λ for which this occurs are called the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, if λ is a characteristic value (i.e., the homogeneous equation u(x) = λ ∫ K(x,y)u(y)dy has non-trivial solutions, called eigenfunctions), the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the function f(x) is orthogonal to all the eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation.\n\nThe kernel K(x, y) is symmetric, since K(y, x) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) y^(n-1-k) x^k = ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) y^j x^(n-1-j) = K(x, y) (by letting j=n-1-k). Therefore, the integral operator is self-adjoint, and its eigenfunctions are the same as the adjoint eigenfunctions.\n\nThe condition for the existence of a solution at a characteristic value λ is:\n∫₀¹ f(x) u_λ(x) dx = 0\nwhere u_λ(x) is an eigenfunction for that λ.\n\nIn our case, f(x) = 1, so the condition is:\n∫₀¹ u_λ(x) dx = 0\n\nAn eigenfunction u_λ(x) corresponds to a non-trivial solution C to the homogeneous system C = λMC. The eigenfunction is u_λ(x) = λ ∑ C_k x^(n-1-k). The integral is:\n∫₀¹ u_λ(x) dx = ∫₀¹ [λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) C_k x^(n-1-k)] dx = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) C_k / (n-k)\nThe condition becomes λ ∑ C_k / (n-k) = 0. Since λ≠0, we need ∑ C_k / (n-k) = 0.\n\nThe equation has no solution for a characteristic value λ if for the corresponding eigenfunction(s) u_λ, we have ∫₀¹ u_λ(x) dx ≠ 0.\n\nLet's test this for n=2. The matrix M is:\nM = [[M₀₀, M₀₁], [M₁₀, M₁₁]] = [[1/(0+2-0), 1/(0+2-1)], [1/(1+2-0), 1/(1+2-1)]] = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]\nThe eigenvalues μ = 1/λ of M are given by det(M - μI) = 0:\n(1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0 => μ² - μ + 1/4 - 1/3 = 0 => μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0\n12μ² - 12μ - 1 = 0\nμ = (12 ± √(144 + 48)) / 24 = (12 ± √192) / 24 = (12 ± 8√3) / 24 = (3 ± 2√3) / 6.\nThe characteristic values are λ = 1/μ = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3.\n\nFor these values of λ, we check the orthogonality condition. An eigenvector C = [C₀, C₁]ᵀ of M satisfies (M-μI)C=0.\n(1/2 - μ)C₀ + C₁ = 0.\nThe condition ∫ u_λ dx = 0 translates to λ(C₀/2 + C₁) = 0, or C₀/2 + C₁ = 0.\nSubstituting C₁ = -C₀/2 into the eigenvector equation gives (1/2 - μ)C₀ - C₀/2 = 0, which means -μC₀ = 0. Since C is a non-trivial eigenvector, C₀ cannot be zero, which implies μ=0. However, μ=0 is not an eigenvalue of M. Thus, the orthogonality condition is never satisfied.\n\nThis indicates that for any characteristic value λ, the condition ∫ u_λ(x) dx ≠ 0 holds, and therefore the equation has no solution.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the values of λ for which 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix M, where M_jk = 1/(j+n-k) for j,k ∈ {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solutions for values of λ such that λ = 1/μ, where μ is an eigenvalue of the n×n matrix M with entries M_jk = 1/(j+n-k).\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix M defined by M_jk = 1/(j + n - k), where j and k are the row and column indices ranging from 0 to n-1.>>>"
