As $t \rightarrow \infty$, the edges of the image will evolve as if they are moving with a velocity proportional to their local curvature. This process, a discrete form of motion by mean curvature, will cause sharp corners to round off, small convex regions to shrink and disappear, and complex boundaries to become smoother. The image will eventually converge to a "root signal," which is a stable configuration with simplified and smoothed shapes that are invariant to further applications of the median filter.
