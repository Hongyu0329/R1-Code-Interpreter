    "White can win in 2 moves.\n\nThe winning sequence begins with a queen sacrifice:\n\n1.  **Qxe1** - White sacrifices the queen to remove the Black rook on e1. This is the key move that opens up a mating attack.\n2.  If Black accepts the sacrifice with **Rxe1**, White delivers checkmate with **Rxf8#**. The Black rook on e1 now blocks its own king's escape.\n\nIf Black does not accept the queen sacrifice, for example by playing 1...Rxf1+, then 2. Kxf1 leaves White with a decisive material advantage and a continuing attack. Under optimal play, facing a forced mate, the sequence leading to mate is considered.\n\n<<<2>>>"
