The number of non-Clifford gates is algorithm-dependent. For a distance-3 code, the concept is not applicable for a universal computer. For a distance-5 code to run a significant algorithm like factoring a 2048-bit integer, it would need to execute on the order of a few billion non-Clifford Toffoli gates.
