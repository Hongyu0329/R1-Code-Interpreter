    "Due to the unavailability of a viewable recording or a detailed choreographic analysis of Natalia Osipova's 2008 Bolshoi Ballet performance of *Don Quixote*, it is not possible to determine the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position she performed in the Act I variation.\n\nWhile it is confirmed that Natalia Osipova danced the role of Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008, including a guest appearance in Novosibirsk, Siberia, extensive research did not yield any working videos or written accounts that specify the precise number of pirouettes executed in the Act I variation. Reviews of her performances from that period praise her technical skill and energetic interpretation of the character, but do not provide a detailed breakdown of the choreography.\n\nNumerous links that may have contained this performance are no longer active. While other videos of Osipova dancing this role in other years or different productions exist, they would not accurately reflect the specific performance in question.\n\nTherefore, a definitive answer to the user's question cannot be provided.\n\n<<<Unable to answer>>>"
