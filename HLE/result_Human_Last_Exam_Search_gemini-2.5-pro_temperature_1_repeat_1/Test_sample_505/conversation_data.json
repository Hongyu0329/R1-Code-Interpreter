    "In surface code, logical qubits are encoded by introducing topological features, such as boundaries and holes, into a 2D array of physical qubits. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded on a given surface is determined by its topology.\n\nFor a single, planar patch of surface code (which has a genus of 0 and one outer boundary), the number of logical qubits, *k*, can be determined by the number of holes, *h*. Each hole is an internal boundary. The formula for the number of logical qubits on an orientable surface with genus *g* and *b* boundaries is `k = 2g + b - 1`.\n\nLet's calculate the capacity for a single patch first:\n*   A single patch is a planar surface, so its genus (*g*) is 0.\n*   It has one outer boundary.\n*   The problem states it has two holes, which count as two additional internal boundaries.\n*   This gives a total of *b* = 1 (outer) + 2 (inner) = 3 boundaries.\n*   Using the formula, the number of logical qubits in one patch is `k = 2*0 + 3 - 1 = 2`.\n\nTherefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode a maximum of 2 logical qubits. Logical operators for these qubits can be formed by paths connecting the holes to each other or to the outer boundary of the patch.\n\nThe problem specifies two such patches. When patches are physically separate and not interacting through processes like lattice surgery, their capacities for storing logical qubits are additive.\n\nThus, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch:\nTotal logical qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2) = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
