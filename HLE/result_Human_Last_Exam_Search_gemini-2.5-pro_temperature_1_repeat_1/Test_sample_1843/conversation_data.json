    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor $N$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N=36036$.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\nSo, the prime power factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of primitive Dirichlet characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if its conductor is exactly $N$.\nIf $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is the prime factorization of $N$, a character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{p_1^{a_1}} \\chi_{p_2^{a_2}} \\cdots \\chi_{p_k^{a_k}}$\nwhere each $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1^{a_1}}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_2^{a_2}}), \\ldots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_k^{a_k}}))$.\n\nWe are looking for characters of order 6. This means that for each component character $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$, its order must be a divisor of 6.\n\n### Step 3: Count primitive characters for each prime power factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each factor ($4, 9, 7, 11, 13$) whose order divides 6. Let $n(p^a, d)$ denote the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ of order $d$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of Dirichlet characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There are two characters. The principal character has conductor 1. The other character has order 2 and is primitive with conductor 4.\n    The possible orders dividing 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    - $n(4, 2) = 1$. There are no primitive characters of other orders dividing 6.\n    So, there is 1 choice for $\\chi_4$, and its order is 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The non-primitive characters are those induced from modulo 3. The character group modulo 3 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. Thus, there is one non-primitive character of order 1 and one of order 2.\n    The group of characters mod 9 has $\\phi(d)$ characters of order $d$ for each $d|6$. Total characters of order 1, 2, 3, 6 are 1, 1, 2, 2 respectively.\n    - $n(9, 1)$: 0 (the principal character is not primitive).\n    - $n(9, 2)$: $1-1=0$.\n    - $n(9, 3)$: $2-0=2$.\n    - $n(9, 6)$: $2-0=2$.\n    The primitive characters mod 9 with orders dividing 6 are those of order 3 or 6. There are $2+2=4$ such characters.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. For a prime modulus, any non-principal character is primitive. The number of characters of order $d$ is $\\phi(d)$.\n    - $n(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - $n(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - $n(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of primitive characters with order dividing 6 is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The orders dividing 6 are 1 and 2.\n    - $n(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    There is 1 primitive character with order dividing 6, and its order is 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The orders dividing 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    - $n(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - $n(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - $n(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The total number of primitive characters with order dividing 6 is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ be a primitive character of conductor $N$. Let $o_i$ be the order of the component character $\\chi_i$. We require $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\n\nThe number of choices for each component character (whose order must divide 6) are:\n*   For $\\chi_4$: 1 choice (order is 2).\n*   For $\\chi_9$: 4 choices (orders are 3 or 6).\n*   For $\\chi_7$: 5 choices (orders are 2, 3, or 6).\n*   For $\\chi_{11}$: 1 choice (order is 2).\n*   For $\\chi_{13}$: 5 choices (orders are 2, 3, or 6).\n\nThe total number of combinations is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that the order of the resulting character is exactly 6 for every combination.\nLet $k = \\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n1.  The choice for $\\chi_4$ has order $o_4=2$. Thus, $k$ must be a multiple of 2.\n2.  Any choice for $\\chi_9$ has order $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. In both cases, the order is a multiple of 3. Thus, $k$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince $k$ is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nFurthermore, since the order of every component character divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\nTherefore, for any possible combination of the component characters, the order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the total number of combinations, which is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
