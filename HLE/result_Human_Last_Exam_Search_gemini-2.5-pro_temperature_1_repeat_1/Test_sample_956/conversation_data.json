    "The group $G$ is the sporadic simple Mathieu group $M_{12}$. The generators provided, while not the most common standard generators, are known to generate $M_{12}$. The Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is a sharply 5-transitive permutation group of order 95,040.\n\nThe Schur multiplier of a group $G$, denoted $M(G)$, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. For the Mathieu group $M_{12}$, the Schur multiplier is a cyclic group of order 2. Therefore, the abelian group $A$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nWe are asked to find the number of proper subgroups of $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, up to isomorphism. A proper subgroup of a group is a subgroup that is not equal to the group itself. The subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$ and the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ itself.\n\nThe proper subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$. The trivial subgroup is unique up to isomorphism. Therefore, there is only one proper subgroup of $A$ up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<1>>>"
