    "Answering this question involves applying the properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), particularly how the DFT of an interleaved sequence relates to the DFTs of the original sequences.\n\n### 1. Define the Sequences\n\nWe are given the 4-point DFTs of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\n*   The DFT of `x(n)` is `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`.\n*   The DFT of `h(n)` is `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n\nWe are asked to find the 4-point DFT for a new 8-point sequence `y(n)` formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nThis can be written more formally as:\n*   `y(2n) = x(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `y(2n+1) = h(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\n### 2. Interpreting \"4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence\"\n\nThe request for a \"4-point DFT\" of an 8-point sequence usually implies a process of decimation. The standard method to derive a 4-point sequence from an 8-point sequence for DFT purposes is by time-aliasing (or folding). A new 4-point sequence, let's call it `z(n)`, is created:\n`z(n) = y(n) + y(n + 4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nA key property of the DFT is that the 4-point DFT of this new sequence `z(n)` is equal to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`. If we denote the 8-point DFT of `y(n)` as `Y(k)`, then the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`, let's call it `Z(k)`, is:\n`Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n### 3. Relating the 8-point DFT to the 4-point DFTs\n\nThe 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence `y(n)` can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`. The derivation, based on the decimation-in-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, gives the following relationship:\n\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\nwhere `W_N^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / N)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nOur goal is to find `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`. We substitute `2k` into the formula for `Y(k)`:\n\n`Z(k) = Y(2k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_8^(2k) * H(2k mod 4)`\n`Z(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_4^k * H(2k mod 4)`\n\nNow, we can calculate each of the four points:\n\n*   **For k = 0:**\n    `Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0) + W_4^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k = 1:**\n    `Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2) + W_4^1 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For k = 2:**\n    `Z(2) = Y(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_4^2 * H(4 mod 4) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k = 3:**\n    `Z(3) = Y(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_4^3 * H(6 mod 4) = X(2) + (j) * H(2) = -1 + j * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe 4-point DFT for the specified sequence is the set of these four values `Z(k)`.\n\n`Z(k) = {1, -1-j, 1, -1+j}`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
