This question is unanswerable because the central metric it asks for, the "minimum ratio of evidence (E_r)", is not a standard or defined concept, and there is no established scientific formula that can integrate the provided, disparate parameters (PCF, SBD, confidence scores, and a bottleneck coefficient) to produce such a ratio.
