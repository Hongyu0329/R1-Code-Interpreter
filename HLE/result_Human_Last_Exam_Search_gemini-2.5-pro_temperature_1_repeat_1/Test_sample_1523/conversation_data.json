    "In the context of finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is given by the functional integral:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ e^(-S_E[ϕ])`\n\nwhere `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action of the field. The Euclidean action is defined on a spacetime with a compactified imaginary time dimension of extent `β = 1/T`, where `T` is the temperature.\n\nThe inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` refers to the part of the Euclidean action that is quadratic in the field `ϕ`. For a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m`, the Euclidean action is given by:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ 1/2 (∂_τ ϕ)^2 + 1/2 (∇ϕ)^2 + 1/2 m^2 ϕ^2 ]`\n\nwhere `τ` is the imaginary time, `x` represents the `d` spatial dimensions, and `∇` is the spatial gradient.\n\nThrough integration by parts, and assuming the fields vanish at the spatial boundary, this action can be written as:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = 1/2 ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ϕ(τ, x) (-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2) ϕ(τ, x)`\n\nFrom this expression, we can identify the operator `D` as the differential operator:\n\n`D = -∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2`\n\nTherefore, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is given by the quadratic part of the action:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x  ϕ(τ, x) D ϕ(τ, x) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x  ϕ(τ, x) (-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2) ϕ(τ, x)`\n\nThis is the expression in position space.\n\nDue to the periodicity of the field in the imaginary time direction, `ϕ(τ, x) = ϕ(τ + β, x)`, it is often more convenient to work in Fourier space (momentum space). The field can be expanded in a Fourier series in the imaginary time direction and a Fourier transform in the spatial directions:\n\n`ϕ(τ, x) = T ∑_{n=-∞}^∞ ∫ d^d k / (2π)^d  e^(i(ω_n τ + k ⋅ x)) ϕ̃(ω_n, k)`\n\nwhere `ω_n = 2πnT` are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.\n\nIn momentum space, the action of the operator `D` on a Fourier mode is to multiply it by `(ω_n^2 + k^2 + m^2)`. Consequently, the inner product in momentum space becomes:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = T ∑_n ∫ d^d k / (2π)^d ϕ̃(-ω_n, -k) (ω_n^2 + k^2 + m^2) ϕ̃(ω_n, k)`\n\nSince the field `ϕ` is real, `ϕ̃(-ω_n, -k) = ϕ̃^*(ω_n, k)`, so the expression can also be written as:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = T ∑_n ∫ d^d k / (2π)^d |ϕ̃(ω_n, k)|^2 (ω_n^2 + k^2 + m^2)`\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function corresponds to the quadratic part of the Euclidean action.\n\nIn **position space**, it is given by:\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ϕ(τ, x) (-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2) ϕ(τ, x)`\nwhere `β=1/T` is the inverse temperature, `τ` is the imaginary time, `d` is the number of spatial dimensions, `∇` is the spatial gradient, and `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n\nIn **momentum space**, the expression becomes:\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = T ∑_{n=-∞}^∞ ∫ d^d k / (2π)^d ϕ̃^* (ω_n, k) (ω_n^2 + k^2 + m^2) ϕ̃(ω_n, k)`\nwhere `ω_n = 2πnT` are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies and `ϕ̃(ω_n, k)` is the Fourier transform of the field `ϕ(τ, x)`.>>>"
