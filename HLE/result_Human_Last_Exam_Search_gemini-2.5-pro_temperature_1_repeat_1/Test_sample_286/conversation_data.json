    "Let $W = 1 - 10^{-M}$. The problem states that for any sequence of steps $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{100000}$ with $a_i \\in$, there must exist a path $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{100000}$ such that every point $x_i$ on the path is within the interval $[-W, W]$. The path is defined by the relation $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ for $1 \\le i \\le 100000$.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer $M$, we first establish a necessary condition on $W$. A necessary condition can often be found by considering an extreme or simple case for the sequence of steps $a_i$.\n\nConsider the sequence where the first step is of maximum length, and all subsequent steps are of zero length. That is, let $a_1 = 1$ and $a_i = 0$ for all $i > 1$. For this sequence, a path must exist. Specifically, for $i=1$, we must be able to find $x_0$ and $x_1$ both within the interval $[-W, W]$ such that $|x_0 - x_1| = a_1 = 1$.\n\nThe interval $[-W, W]$ has a total length of $2W$. For this interval to contain two points, $x_0$ and $x_1$, that are a distance of 1 apart, the length of the interval must be at least 1. For instance, if $x_0 = -W$ and $x_1 = W$, their distance is $2W$. The maximum possible distance between any two points in the interval is $2W$. Therefore, we must have:\n$1 \\le 2W$\n$W \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow, we substitute the definition of $W$ in terms of $M$:\n$1 - 10^{-M} \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSolving for $M$:\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\ge 10^{-M}$\n$2 \\le 10^M$\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer $M$ that satisfies this inequality, we can take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n$\\log_{10}(2) \\le M$\n\nSince $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.30103$, the inequality is $M \\ge 0.30103$. As $M$ must be a positive integer, the smallest integer value for $M$ is 1.\n\nThis shows that $M=1$ is a necessary condition. It can also be shown that this condition is sufficient. If $W \\ge 1/2$, for any sequence of steps $a_i \\in$, a valid path can always be constructed. For example, one can employ a strategy of keeping the path close to one of the endpoints of the interval. Let's choose $x_0 = W$. Then for each step $i$, we decide between $x_i = x_{i-1} + a_i$ and $x_i = x_{i-1} - a_i$. We can try to choose the sign to keep $x_i$ in $[-W, W]$. If one choice fails, we check if the other works. A failure in the construction would mean that for some $x_{i-1}$, both $x_{i-1}+a_i$ and $x_{i-1}-a_i$ lie outside $[-W, W]$. This cannot happen if $2W \\ge 1$.\n\nThus, the necessary condition is also sufficient. The smallest positive integer $M$ is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
