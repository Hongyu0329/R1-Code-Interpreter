    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Atomic Composition of Toluene (C7H8):**\n*   The chemical formula C7H8 indicates that a toluene molecule contains 7 carbon (C) atoms and 8 hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**2. Contracted Functions per Atom in the 6-31G Basis Set:**\n\n*   The notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions. It is a split-valence basis set.\n    *   **Core Orbitals:** The '6' signifies that each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function made from 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals:** The '31' indicates that the valence orbitals are split into two functions. The inner part is a contracted function of 3 primitives, and the outer part is a single primitive Gaussian function.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has one valence orbital (1s).\n    *   This is split into two contracted functions.\n    *   Total for one H atom = 2 contracted functions.\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   Carbon has one core orbital (1s) and four valence orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   The 1s core orbital is represented by 1 contracted function.\n    *   The 2s valence orbital is split into 2 contracted functions.\n    *   The three 2p valence orbitals are each split into 2 contracted functions (3 orbitals × 2 functions/orbital = 6 functions).\n    *   Total for one C atom = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = 9 contracted functions.\n\n**3. Total Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):**\n\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 contracted functions.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 contracted functions.\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
