    "Let $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. We are looking for the smallest size of a subset $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$.\n\nLet $C$ be any cyclic subgroup of the group $G$. The group operation in $G$ is addition, and the identity element is $0 = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n\nBy the definition of a subgroup, every subgroup of $G$ must contain the identity element, $0$. Therefore, for any cyclic subgroup $C$ of $G$, it is true that $0 \\in C$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set $A = \\{0\\}$. The size of this set is 1.\n\nThe condition given is that for every cyclic subgroup $C$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap C$ must be non-empty.\nLet's check this condition for our choice of $A = \\{0\\}$.\nFor any cyclic subgroup $C$, we know that $0 \\in C$. Since $0$ is also the only element in $A$, we have:\n$A \\cap C = \\{0\\} \\cap C = \\{0\\}$.\n\nThe set $\\{0\\}$ is not the empty set. Thus, the condition $A \\cap C \\neq \\emptyset$ is satisfied for every cyclic subgroup $C$ of $G$.\n\nThis shows that the set $A=\\{0\\}$ is a valid set that fulfills the requirement of the problem. The size of this set is 1.\n\nTo determine if this is the *smallest* size, we consider smaller possible sizes. The only smaller non-negative integer size is 0. A set of size 0 is the empty set, $A = \\emptyset$. If we choose $A=\\emptyset$, then for any cyclic subgroup $C$, the intersection is $A \\cap C = \\emptyset \\cap C = \\emptyset$. This is the empty set, so the condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, the size of $A$ must be at least 1. Since we have found a valid set of size 1, this must be the smallest possible size.\n\nThe smallest size of $A$ is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
