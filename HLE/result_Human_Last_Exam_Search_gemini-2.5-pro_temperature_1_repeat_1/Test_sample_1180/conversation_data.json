    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2=2*x^5+2*x^3+1$ above 2, we analyze the branch points of the curve. The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the p-adic distances between its branch points.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the equation of the curve. Let $x = 1/t$ and $z = Z/t^3$. Substituting these into the original equation gives:\n$(Z/t^3)^2 = 2(1/t)^5 + 2(1/t)^3 + 1$\n$Z^2/t^6 = (2 + 2t^2 + t^5)/t^5$\n$Z^2 = t(t^5 + 2t^2 + 2)$\n\nThis is a new model for the same curve, and its stable reduction will be the same. The branch points of this hyperelliptic curve $Z^2 = P(t)$ are the roots of the polynomial $P(t) = t(t^5 + 2t^2 + 2) = t^6 + 2t^4 + 2t$.\n\nThe stable reduction is determined by how the branch points \"cluster\" together in the 2-adic sense. We use the valuation $v$ normalized by $v(2)=1$. The branch points are $t=0$ and the five roots of the polynomial $h(t) = t^5 + 2t^2 + 2$.\n\nLet's find the valuations of the roots of $h(t)$. We can use the Newton polygon for $h(t)$ with respect to the valuation $v$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are given by the points $(i, v(c_i))$, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $t^i$. The points are:\n*   For $t^5$, the point is $(5, v(1)) = (5, 0)$.\n*   For $2t^2$, the point is $(2, v(2)) = (2, 1)$.\n*   For the constant term $2$, the point is $(0, v(2)) = (0, 1)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points is a single line segment connecting $(0, 1)$ and $(5, 0)$. The slope of this segment is $(0-1)/(5-0) = -1/5$. The valuations of the roots are the negative of the slopes of the Newton polygon. Therefore, all five roots of $h(t)$, let's call them $\\eta_i$, have valuation $v(\\eta_i) = 1/5$.\n\nNow we analyze the clustering of the branch points $\\{0, \\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\eta_3, \\eta_4, \\eta_5\\}$.\n*   The valuation of the difference between the root 0 and any root $\\eta_i$ is $v(0 - \\eta_i) = v(\\eta_i) = 1/5$.\n*   The valuation of the differences between the roots $\\eta_i$ can be shown to be smaller than $1/5$. This means the roots $\\{\\eta_1, ..., \\eta_5\\}$ form a cluster that is separate from the root $\\{0\\}$.\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve will have two components corresponding to these two clusters of branch points: one for the single branch point $\\{0\\}$ and another for the cluster of five branch points $\\{\\eta_1, ..., \\eta_5\\}$. These two components meet at an ordinary double point.\n\nThe thickness of this double point is given by half the distance between the clusters. The distance between the clusters is the minimum valuation of the difference between a point in one cluster and a point in the other, which is $1/5$.\n\nThickness = (1/2) * (distance between clusters) = (1/2) * (1/5) = 1/10.\n\n<<<1/10>>>"
