    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to determine all the pixels that form the line. Bresenham's algorithm is a method for drawing lines on a grid of pixels.\n\nHere are the steps of the algorithm for the given line:\n\n1.  **Calculate the change in x and y:**\n    *   dx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   dy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial decision parameter:**\n    *   p = 2 * dy - dx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Determine the pixels:**\n    Starting with the first point (1,1), we iterate to find the subsequent pixels. The algorithm will produce the following sequence of pixels:\n    (1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,4), (9,4), (10,5), (11,5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in this line segment. To find the central pixel, we find the middle of this sequence. With 11 pixels, the central pixel is the 6th one.\n\nThe 6th pixel in the sequence is (6, 3).\n\n<<<**(6, 3)***>>>"
