    "The conceptual entity that Fernand Braudel, quoting Paul Morand, described as needing to be inscribed within a sphere, and which is exemplified by the symbol of a nation, is **civilization**.\n\nIn his work, particularly in \"Grammaire des civilisations\" (A History of Civilizations), Fernand Braudel advocates for a historical perspective that transcends national boundaries to consider larger cultural and historical units. For Braudel, a civilization is a long-term structure, a space, a \"sphere\" that encompasses various elements, including nations. His analysis of history often involves examining the interplay of different spheres—such as the geographical, economic, and cultural—that constitute a civilization. Therefore, a nation is seen as a component part existing within the broader sphere of a civilization.\n\nWhile the direct quotation from Paul Morand as cited by Braudel has not been located in the search results, the conceptual framework of Braudel's historical method strongly supports the conclusion that the entity in question is \"civilization.\"\n\n<<<civilization>>>"
