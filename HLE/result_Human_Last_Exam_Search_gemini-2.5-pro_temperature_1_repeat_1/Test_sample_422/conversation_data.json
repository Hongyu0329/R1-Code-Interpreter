    "Assuming the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, where knowledge is a belief that is both justified and true, and limiting our epistemic states to only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" two significant problems arise, distinct from the famous Gettier problems.\n\nThe two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Justification's Ambiguity:** The JTB framework does not specify the quality or degree of justification required for a belief to be considered knowledge. Justification can range from weak to overwhelmingly strong. This ambiguity creates a dilemma: if a low standard of justification is accepted, then a true belief supported by flimsy, albeit technically valid, reasoning would have to be categorized as \"Knowledge.\" Conversely, if an impossibly high standard of justification is required, such as absolute certainty, then very few beliefs would ever qualify as \"Knowledge,\" which runs counter to our common understanding. With only the binary choice between \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" there is no middle ground for beliefs that are true and have some justification, but not enough to confidently be called knowledge.\n\n2.  **The Problem of \"Benign\" Epistemic Luck:** The JTB definition does not adequately account for the role of luck in acquiring knowledge, even in cases that are not of the \"Gettier\" variety. For example, a person might be lucky to be in the right place at the right time to witness an event and form a justified true belief about it. While the justification, the belief, and the truth align, the opportunity to gain this knowledge was a matter of chance. In a system with only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" as possible states, this luckily obtained justified true belief must be classified as \"Knowledge.\" This is problematic because it bestows the status of \"Knowledge\" on a belief that is, in a fundamental way, accidental, which conflicts with the intuition that knowledge should be the result of a more robust and non-coincidental process.\n\n<<<The two problems JTB runs into, when ignoring Gettier problems and restricting epistemic states to only Knowledge and Belief, are the ambiguity of the justification condition and the issue of \"benign\" epistemic luck.>>>"
