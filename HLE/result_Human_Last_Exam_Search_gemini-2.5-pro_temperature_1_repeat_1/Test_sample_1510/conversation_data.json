    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry elements, which include translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections. The point group of a wallpaper group consists of the rotational and reflectional symmetries that leave at least one point fixed. The order of a group is the number of elements it contains.\n\nA point group of order 2 can be one of two types:\n*   **C₂:** This cyclic group contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n*   **D₁:** This dihedral group is isomorphic to C₂ and contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nThe following wallpaper groups have a point group of order 2:\n*   **p2:** Its point group is C₂. This group has 180-degree rotational symmetry but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm:** Its point group is D₁. This group has reflection symmetry across parallel axes.\n*   **pg:** Its point group is D₁. This group's symmetries consist of parallel glide reflections.\n*   **cm:** Its point group is D₁. This group contains both reflections and glide reflections along parallel axes.\n\nThe other 13 wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders. For instance, the point group for p1 is C₁ (order 1), while the point groups for pmm, pmg, pgg, and cmm are all D₂ (order 4).\n\n<<<4>>>"
