    "Based on the current state of the Connect 4 board, the optimal moves for player 'O' to win as quickly as possible are in columns c, d, and f. Each of these moves creates a situation where 'O' is guaranteed to win on their next turn.\n\nHere are the optimal moves:\n\n*   **c4:** Placing a piece in column 'c' at row 4 creates a horizontal line of three 'O's (`c4, d4, e4`). This creates two winning spots on the next turn, at `b4` and `f4`. Player 'X' can only block one of these, allowing 'O' to win on the subsequent move by placing a piece in the unblocked spot.\n*   **d3:** Placing a piece in column 'd' at row 3 creates a vertical line of three 'O's (`d3, d4, d5`). This forces 'X' to block the immediate win by playing in `d2`. After 'X' makes this defensive move, 'O' can play at `f3`, completing a winning diagonal line (`c6, d5, e4, f3`).\n*   **f4:** Placing a piece in column 'f' at row 4 results in a horizontal line of three 'O's (`d4, e4, f4`). This presents 'X' with two possible blocking positions, `c4` and `g4`. Since 'X' can only occupy one of these spaces, 'O' can secure the win on the next turn by placing a piece in the other column.\n\nAll three of these moves lead to a victory for 'O' in the same number of turns, making them equally optimal for the fastest possible win.\n\n<<<c4, d3, f4>>>"
