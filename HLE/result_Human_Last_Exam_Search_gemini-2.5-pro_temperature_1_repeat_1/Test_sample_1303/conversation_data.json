    "The chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is an angiotensin II receptor blocker. While its specific name is listed as \"Undefined\" in the ChEMBL database, its molecular formula, C24H29N5O3, corresponds to the well-known drug Valsartan or one of its stereoisomers. The primary protein target for this class of drugs is the Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R).\n\nTherefore, other small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with the same target are other angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). These drugs are primarily used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure.\n\nHere are some examples of small molecules that interact with the Angiotensin II receptor type 1:\n\n*   **Losartan (Cozaar)**: The first ARB to be marketed, it is used to treat high blood pressure, diabetic kidney disease, and to lower the risk of stroke.\n*   **Candesartan (Atacand)**: Prescribed for hypertension and heart failure.\n*   **Irbesartan (Avapro)**: Used for treating high blood pressure and diabetic nephropathy.\n*   **Olmesartan (Benicar)**: Another ARB used for the management of hypertension.\n*   **Telmisartan (Micardis)**: This medication is used to treat high blood pressure, and to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.\n*   **Azilsartan (Edarbi)**: A potent ARB for the treatment of hypertension.\n*   **Eprosartan (Teveten)**: Used to treat high blood pressure.\n\nThese small molecules all function by blocking the AT1 receptor, which prevents the hormone angiotensin II from binding and causing blood vessels to constrict, thereby lowering blood pressure.\n\n<<<The small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 are other angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).
