    "The search results confirm the presentation of the semidihedral group and provide context on its structure.\n\n*   **Definition of Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order 2^n, denoted SD_2^n, has the presentation ⟨r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2) - 1)⟩. For the semidihedral group of order 512 = 2^9, we have n=9. The presentation is ⟨r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(128 - 1) = r^127⟩. This matches the presentation I used.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup H of a group G is a power subgroup if there exists an integer m such that H = G^m = {g^m | g ∈ G}. This also matches the definition I used.\n\nMy analysis of the power subgroups G^k depended on whether k is odd or even.\n\n*   **k is odd:** I concluded that G^k = G.\n    *   (r^i)^k = r^(ik). Since k is odd, gcd(k, 256) = 1, so the set of these powers is the entire cyclic subgroup <r>.\n    *   (sr^i)^k = s * r^(i * (something odd)). My previous calculation was (sr^i)^k = s * r^(i(1-128m)) where k=2m+1. Let's re-verify this.\n        (sr^i)^2 = r^(128i).\n        (sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^(2m+1) = ((sr^i)^2)^m * (sr^i) = (r^(128i))^m * (sr^i) = r^(128im) * sr^i.\n        To simplify `r^(128im) * s`, we use the relation `sr = r^127 * s`, which generalizes to `sr^j = r^(j*127) * s`.  Therefore, `r^j * s = s * r^(j * 127)`.\n        So, `r^(128im) * s = s * r^(128im * 127)`.\n        `r^(128im * 127) = r^(128im * (128-1)) = r^(16384im - 128im)`. Since the order of r is 256, 16384 is a multiple of 256, so `r^(16384im) = 1`.  Thus, `r^(128im * 127) = r^(-128im) = r^(128im)`.\n        So `r^(128im) * s = s * r^(128im)`.\n        Then `(sr^i)^k = s * r^(128im) * r^i = s * r^(i(128m+1))`.\n        The exponent is `128m+1`. Since m can be any integer, this will always be odd. The set of elements `r^(i(128m+1))` for `0 <= i < 256` is `<r>` because `gcd(128m+1, 256) = 1`.\n        So for odd k, G^k = <r> U s<r> = G. This confirms that for any odd k, the power subgroup is G itself.\n\n*   **k is even:** I concluded that G^k = <r^k>.\n    *   (r^i)^k = r^(ik). This generates the subgroup <r^k>.\n    *   (sr^i)^k = ((sr^i)^2)^(k/2) = (r^(128i))^(k/2) = r^(64ik).\n    *   G^k = {r^(ik)} U {r^(64ik)} = <r^k> U <r^(64k)>.\n    *   Since <r^(64k)> is a subgroup of <r^k>, G^k = <r^k>.\n    *   We are looking for the number of distinct subgroups of the form <r^k> where k is an even integer.\n    *   The distinct subgroups of <r> are of the form <r^d> where d is a divisor of 256. The divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\n    *   A subgroup <r^d> is a power subgroup if there exists an even k such that <r^k> = <r^d>. This is equivalent to `gcd(k, 256) = d`.\n    *   Since k is even, `gcd(k, 256)` must be an even number.\n    *   Therefore, d cannot be 1.\n    *   For any other divisor d = 2^j where j is in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, we can choose k=d. Since j>=1, d is even.\n    *   So, the possible power subgroups for even k are <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, <r^256> = {e}.\n    *   This gives 8 distinct power subgroups.\n\nIn total, we have:\n1.  G (from any odd k)\n2.  <r^2>\n3.  <r^4>\n4.  <r^8>\n5.  <r^16>\n6.  <r^32>\n7.  <r^64>\n8.  <r^128>\n9.  {e} = <r^256>\n\nThis gives a total of 9 power subgroups. The logic seems sound and consistent. I have re-verified all the steps and calculations. The search results did not provide a direct formula for the number of power subgroups of a semidihedral group, but they confirmed the group structure, which was the basis of my derivation. I am confident in my result.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n1 subgroup from odd exponents (G itself).\n8 subgroups from even exponents (<r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^256>).\nTotal = 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nI will now format the final answer.\nThe semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, is a non-abelian group of order 512. A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be expressed as H = G^k = {g^k | g ∈ G} for some integer k.\n\nThe analysis of the power subgroups of SD_512 splits into two cases based on the exponent k.\n\nCase 1: k is an odd integer.\nFor any odd integer k, the set of k-th powers of all elements in SD_512 results in the group SD_512 itself. Therefore, for all odd k, we obtain only one distinct power subgroup, which is the group G itself.\n\nCase 2: k is an even integer.\nFor any even integer k, the set of k-th powers of all elements in SD_512 forms a cyclic subgroup of the form <r^k>, where <r> is the unique cyclic subgroup of order 256 in SD_512. The distinct subgroups of this form correspond to the subgroups <r^d> where d is an even divisor of 256. The divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. The even divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. This gives rise to the following 8 distinct power subgroups:\n*   <r^2> (subgroup of order 128)\n*   <r^4> (subgroup of order 64)\n*   <r^8> (subgroup of order 32)\n*   <r^16> (subgroup of order 16)\n*   <r^32> (subgroup of order 8)\n*   <r^64> (subgroup of order 4)\n*   <r^128> (subgroup of order 2)\n*   <r^256> = {e} (the trivial subgroup of order 1)\n\nCombining the two cases, we have 1 power subgroup from the odd exponents and 8 power subgroups from the even exponents.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 8 = 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\nFinal list of power subgroups:\n1.  SD_512\n2.  <r^2>\n3.  <r^4>\n4.  <r^8>\n5.  <r^16>\n6.  <r^32>\n7.  <r^64>\n8.  <r^128>\n9.  {e}\n\nThe number of power subgroups is 9.\n<<<9>>>"
