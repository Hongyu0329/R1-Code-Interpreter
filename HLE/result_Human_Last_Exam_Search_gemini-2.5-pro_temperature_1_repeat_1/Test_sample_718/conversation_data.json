    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is 1-resolvable.\n\nA functor is defined as *n-resolvable* if it admits a projective resolution of length at most *n*, meaning its homological dimension is at most *n*.\n\nIn the context of the representation theory of posets, particularly in the framework developed for topological data analysis, the homological properties of tame functors have been studied extensively. A key result is that when the indexing poset $J$ is an upper semilattice, the category of tame functors with values in $\\text{Vect}_K$ is well-behaved, allowing for the construction of minimal free resolutions.\n\nFor a tame functor $M$ indexed by the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ (which is an upper semilattice), its minimal free resolution has the form:\n$0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$\nThis is a resolution of length 1. This indicates that the first syzygy of $M$ is projective, and thus the projective dimension of $M$ is at most 1.\n\nThis property is not limited to the case of the real line but extends to the more general setting of tame functors on upper semilattices. The existence of these short resolutions is often connected to the ability to use tools like the Koszul complex to compute homological invariants, a recurring theme in the research on this topic.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor on an upper semilattice is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
