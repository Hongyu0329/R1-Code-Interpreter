    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4. This is determined by analyzing the homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to the two groups of order 4: the cyclic group of order 4 (ℤ₄) and the Klein four-group (ℤ₂ × ℤ₂).\n\nThe number of subgroups of a given index in a group is related to the number of its surjective homomorphisms onto a group of that order. The subgroups of index 4 are the kernels of the surjective homomorphisms to transitive groups of degree 4, namely ℤ₄ and ℤ₂ × ℤ₂.\n\nA crucial property of the Grigorchuk group (let's call it G) is its abelianization, which is the quotient group G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is the elementary abelian group of order 8, which is isomorphic to (ℤ/2ℤ)³.\n\nFirst, consider homomorphisms from G to ℤ₄. Any homomorphism from a group G to an abelian group A must factor through the abelianization of G. Therefore, the homomorphisms from G to ℤ₄ correspond to the homomorphisms from its abelianization, (ℤ/2ℤ)³, to ℤ₄. Since all non-identity elements in (ℤ/2ℤ)³ have order 2, their images under any homomorphism must have an order that divides 2. In ℤ₄, the elements with order dividing 2 are 0 and 2. This means that no element from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ can be mapped to 1 or 3, which are the generators of ℤ₄. Consequently, there are no surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to ℤ₄, and thus no subgroups of index 4 with a quotient isomorphic to ℤ₄.\n\nNext, we consider homomorphisms from G to ℤ₂ × ℤ₂. Again, these correspond to homomorphisms from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ to ℤ₂ × ℤ₂. A homomorphism from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ is determined by where it sends the three generators. Since all elements in ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ have an order that divides 2, any of the three generators of (ℤ/2ℤ)³ can be mapped to any of the four elements of ℤ₂ × ℤ₂. This gives a total of 4³ = 64 possible homomorphisms.\n\nTo find the number of distinct subgroups, we need to count the number of surjective homomorphisms and divide by the order of the automorphism group of ℤ₂ × ℤ₂.\nThe homomorphisms that are *not* surjective have an image that is a proper subgroup of ℤ₂ × ℤ₂.\n*   The trivial homomorphism (image is the identity): There is 1 such homomorphism.\n*   Homomorphisms where the image is a subgroup of order 2: ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ has three distinct subgroups of order 2. For each of these, there are 2³ - 1 = 7 surjective homomorphisms from (ℤ/2ℤ)³. This gives a total of 3 * 7 = 21 homomorphisms with an image of order 2.\n\nThe number of surjective homomorphisms is the total number of homomorphisms minus those that are not surjective: 64 - 1 - 21 = 42.\n\nEach of these 42 surjective homomorphisms has a kernel which is a normal subgroup of index 4. The number of distinct kernels is found by dividing the number of surjective homomorphisms by the order of the automorphism group of the target group, ℤ₂ × ℤ₂. The automorphism group of ℤ₂ × ℤ₂ is the general linear group GL(2, 2), which has an order of (2² - 1)(2² - 2) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 42 / 6 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
