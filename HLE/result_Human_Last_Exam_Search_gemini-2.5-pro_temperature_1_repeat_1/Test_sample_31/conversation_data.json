    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, a solver must gather enough visual information to distinguish between all 21 possible permutations. The top-facing stickers are all oriented correctly and are the same color, providing no information about the permutation of the pieces. Therefore, a solver must observe the side-facing stickers of the last layer.\n\nThe most efficient and common method for this is 2-side PLL recognition, where the solver looks at two adjacent faces of the cube, for instance, the Front and Right faces. When viewing the cube from this angle, six non-top-facing stickers are visible on the last layer:\n*   The front-facing sticker of the front-left corner.\n*   The front-facing sticker of the front edge.\n*   The front-facing sticker of the front-right corner.\n*   The right-facing sticker of the front-right corner.\n*   The right-facing sticker of the right edge.\n*   The right-facing sticker of the back-right corner.\n\nWhile six stickers are in the field of view with this method, the minimum number of sticker colors one must actually process to deduce the exact case is five. By identifying the colors of five stickers in specific key positions, a solver can determine the identity of five of the eight last layer pieces (three corners and two edges). Through a process of elimination, the positions of the remaining three pieces (one corner and two edges) are also known. This is sufficient information to uniquely determine the permutation of all eight last-layer pieces and thus identify the specific PLL case.\n\nFor example, by observing the front-facing stickers of the two front corners and the front edge, plus the right-facing stickers of the right edge and the back-right corner, the identity of all pieces can be determined. A recent recognition system for ZBLL (a superset of PLL) also confirms that the information from six stickers is sufficient, and for tracking purposes, this can be thought of as five key pieces of information. Therefore, while a glance at two faces reveals six stickers, the minimum amount of information required corresponds to the identity of five stickers.\n\n<<<5>>>"
