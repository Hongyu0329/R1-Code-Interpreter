In scalar field theoretical frameworks, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, quantitatively scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, below the upper critical dimension of four, primarily through the epsilon expansion, where ε = 4 - d. To the leading order in ε, the relationship for an n-component order parameter is given by α = [(4 - n) / (n + 8)] * ε. This demonstrates a linear dependence of α on the deviation of the dimensionality from four. This result is consistent with the hyperscaling relation α = 2 - dν, where ν is the correlation length exponent, which itself is a function of d. For the Ising model (n=1), the scaling to the first order is α ≈ (1/6) * (4 - d).
