    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, corresponds to a Galois connection between the underlying posets. The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite, non-empty, linearly ordered sets $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\nAn adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of non-decreasing maps (morphisms in $\\Delta$), $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$, that form a Galois connection. This means that for all $x \\in [m]$ and $y \\in [n]$, the following equivalence holds: $f(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le g(y)$.\n\nThe number of such adjunctions is equal to the number of maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ that are left adjoints, or equivalently, the number of maps $g: [n] \\to [m]$ that are right adjoints.\n\nA map between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). For a map $f: [m] \\to [n]$, which is already non-decreasing, this condition simplifies significantly. The join in $[k]$ is the maximum. For any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [m]$, the property $f(\\max(S)) = \\max(f(S))$ is automatically satisfied because $f$ is non-decreasing. The only remaining condition comes from preserving the supremum of the empty set. The supremum of the empty set in a poset is its least element, which is $0$. Thus, a non-decreasing map $f$ preserves all suprema if and only if $f(0)=0$.\n\nTherefore, the number of adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is the number of non-decreasing maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $f(0)=0$. For this problem, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\nWe are counting the number of sequences $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing 23 numbers, with replacement, from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, and arranging them in a non-decreasing order. This is a classic stars-and-bars combinatorics problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $r$ items with replacement is given by the formula $\\binom{r+k-1}{k}$.\n\nIn this case, we are choosing $k=23$ values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$. The values are chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $r = 38$ elements.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nThis number can also be derived by considering the right adjoint $g: \\to$. A map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). For a non-decreasing map between linear orders, this simplifies to the condition that it preserves the top element, i.e., $g(37) = 23$. Counting such maps yields the same result.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions in $\\Delta$ from $$ to $$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<$\\binom{60}{23}$>>>"
