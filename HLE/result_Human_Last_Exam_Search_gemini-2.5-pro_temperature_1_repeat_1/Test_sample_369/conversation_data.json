    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must first identify the syllables, account for elisions, and then determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable to form the six metrical feet. A dactyl consists of one long syllable followed by two short syllables (— U U), while a spondee consists of two long syllables (— —).\n\nThe line is from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura* (Book 4, line 740). Its scansion is notoriously complex due to multiple consecutive words that can undergo elision.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  ***verum ubi***: The final \"-um\" of *verum* is elided before the initial \"u\" of *ubi*. The first syllable, \"ver-\", becomes long by position. The \"u\" and \"bi\" of *ubi* are both short. This forms the first foot.\n    *   **Foot 1:** `ver(um) u-bi` (— U U) = **Dactyl (D)**\n\n2.  ***equi atque***: The final \"-i\" of *equi* is elided before the \"a\" of *atque*. The initial \"e-\" of *equi* is long by nature here, and the syllable \"atque\" is treated as a single long syllable, a phenomenon that can occur in epic poetry.\n    *   **Foot 2:** `equ(i) atque` (— —) = **Spondee (S)**\n\n3.  ***hominis***: This word undergoes synizesis, where the two short vowels in \"-minis\" are compressed into a single long sound, effectively making the word two syllables (`hom-nis`). The initial \"ho-\" is long by nature.\n    *   **Foot 3:** `hominis` (— —) = **Spondee (S)**\n\n4.  ***casu***: The \"a\" in the ablative singular is long by nature, as is the \"u\".\n    *   **Foot 4:** `ca-su` (— —) = **Spondee (S)**\n\n5.  ***convenit***: The first syllable, \"con-\", is long by position. The following two syllables, \"-ve-\" and \"-nit\", are both short.\n    *   **Foot 5:** `con-ve-nit` (— U U) = **Dactyl (D)**\n\n6.  ***imago***: The initial \"i\" is treated as a consonant (\"j\"), a process known as synizesis, which reduces the word to two syllables (`jma-go`). The final \"o\" is long. The final foot is a trochee (— U), which is metrically equivalent to a spondee in the sixth foot.\n    *   **Foot 6:** `ima-go` (— —) = **Spondee (S)**\n\nCombining these feet gives the complete scansion of the line.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
