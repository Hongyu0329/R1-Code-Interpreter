    "To find the separatrix of the system, we first analyze the phase plane equation. The system of differential equations is given by:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nThe trajectories in the phase plane $(u, d)$ are described by the differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the $d'$ equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the $d'$ equation becomes $2d^2 + (5-3)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the plane $u \\geq 0$ are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo understand the structure of the phase portrait, we linearize the system around the equilibrium points by computing the Jacobian matrix $J(u,d)$:\n$$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d - 3u^2+4u^3 & 4d -3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   At $(1,0)$: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so $(1,0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   At $(1,-1)$: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. The eigenvalues have opposite signs, so $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n*   At $(0,0)$: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive.\n\n**3. Separatrices and Saddle Points**\n\nSeparatrices are trajectories that separate regions of different qualitative behavior. They are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. Here, the saddle point is $(1,-1)$.\n\nThe stable manifold of $(1,-1)$ corresponds to the eigenvector for the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_2=-2$. The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which is a vertical direction. This manifold is the line $u=1$ for $d<0$.\n\nThe unstable manifold of $(1,-1)$ corresponds to the eigenvector for the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$. The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The manifold is a trajectory leaving the saddle point with a slope of $\\frac{-2}{1}=-2$.\n\n**4. Finding an Analytic Solution for the Separatrix**\n\nLet's search for a simple analytic solution to the phase plane equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$. A common technique is to try a polynomial ansatz. Let's try $d(u) = -u^2$.\n\n*   Left-hand side (LHS): $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\n*   Right-hand side (RHS):\n    $$\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4}{u^2(u-1)}$$\n    $$= \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$$\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact trajectory of the system.\n\nLet's check if this trajectory corresponds to the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$:\n*   The curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the point $(1, -1^2) = (1,-1)$.\n*   The slope of the curve at $u=1$ is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2)|_{u=1} = -2u|_{u=1} = -2$. This matches the slope of the unstable manifold at the saddle point.\n\nThus, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\n**5. Role of the Separatrix**\n\nThis trajectory acts as a separatrix. To see this, we can analyze the behavior of other trajectories relative to this curve, particularly in the region $0<u<1$.\n\n*   For a point on the u-axis ($d=0$), the slope of the trajectory is $\\frac{dd}{du}|_{d=0} = \\frac{-u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} = u$. Since the slope is positive for $u>0$, trajectories crossing the u-axis from below will move into the upper half-plane ($d>0$).\n*   Trajectories starting in the region $d>0$ (and $0<u<1$) originate from the source at $(1,0)$ and flow towards the y-axis ($u=0$). As they approach the y-axis, they are flowing upwards, towards $d=+\\infty$.\n*   Trajectories starting below the curve $d=-u^2$ can be shown to flow towards the origin $(0,0)$.\n*   Trajectories starting above the curve $d=-u^2$ flow towards $d=+\\infty$ as $u \\to 0$.\n\nThe curve $d=-u^2$ therefore separates the phase plane into two regions with distinct fates: a basin of attraction for the equilibrium point $(0,0)$ and a region where trajectories escape to infinity. This is the definition of a separatrix.\n\nThe separatrix of the system is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n"
