    "When the English term \"shock absorber\" is adapted into Puerto Rican Spanish, its pronunciation undergoes several changes to fit the phonological patterns of the dialect. Based on the primary features of Puerto Rican Spanish, the phonetic transcription would be **[t͡ʃok a.solˈβel]**.\n\nThis pronunciation can be broken down as follows:\n\n### **\"Shock\" → [t͡ʃok]**\n*   **Initial sound**: The English \"sh\" sound, phonetically /ʃ/, does not exist as a distinct phoneme in Spanish. It is commonly adapted to the \"ch\" sound, /t͡ʃ/, similar to how \"shampoo\" becomes *champú*.\n*   **Vowel**: The English vowel /ɑ/ (as in \"cot\") is typically replaced by the Spanish /o/, influenced by the word's spelling.\n*   **Final consonant**: The final /k/ sound remains.\n\n### **\"Absorber\" → [a.solˈβel]**\nThe adaptation of \"absorber\" (/əbˈsɔːrbər/) showcases some of the most distinct characteristics of Puerto Rican Spanish phonology:\n*   **Initial Vowel**: The unstressed initial English schwa (/ə/) is pronounced as a full Spanish /a/.\n*   **Consonants /b/ and /s/**: In the adapted form, syllabified as a-sol-ber, the /s/ is at the beginning of a syllable and is pronounced clearly. The /b/ between vowels (in this case, between 'o' and 'e') is softened to a fricative sound, represented as [β].\n*   **Lateralization of /r/**: A hallmark of Puerto Rican Spanish is the lateralization of the /r/ sound to an [l] sound when it appears at the end of a syllable before a consonant. In \"absorber\" (a**r**-ber), the 'r' before the 'b' undergoes this change, making the syllable sound like \"sol\" instead of \"sor\". The same process applies to the word-final 'r', turning the \"-ber\" ending into [-bel]. Studies show that this lateralization is a very common feature across the island.\n*   **Final Syllable**: The unstressed English ending \"-er\" (/ər/) is typically adapted to /eɾ/ in Spanish. Due to the tendency for word-final /ɾ/ to also lateralize in this dialect, it becomes [el].\n\nWhile in everyday conversation, a speaker might simply use the Spanish term *amortiguador* or the shortened and pluralized anglicism *los choques* ([loh ˈt͡ʃokeh]), the phonetic rendering of the full English borrowing \"shock absorber\" directly reflects the unique sound patterns of Puerto Rican Spanish.\n\n<<<[t͡ʃok a.solˈβel]>>>"
