**Achieved Doubling Rate (W):**
The doubling rate you will achieve based on your incorrect probabilities is:
\( W = \ln(3) - \dfrac{7}{4}\ln(2) \)

**Decrease in Doubling Rate (\(\Delta W\)):**
The amount by which your doubling rate has decreased is:
\( \Delta W = W^* - W = \dfrac{11}{4}\ln(2) - \dfrac{3}{2}\ln(3) \)
