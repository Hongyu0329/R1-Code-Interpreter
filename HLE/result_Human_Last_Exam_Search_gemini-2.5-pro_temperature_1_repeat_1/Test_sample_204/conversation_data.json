    "### The Hopf Charge of the Defined Vector Field is 1\n\nThe Hopf charge, a topological invariant, of the specified three-dimensional vector field is 1. This conclusion is reached by analyzing the structure of the field, which describes a configuration known as a toroidal hopfion. The charge is determined by the winding numbers of the field's mapping from 3D space to a 2D sphere.\n\nThe provided vector field is defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n*   `G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n*   `nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis vector `(nx, ny, nz)` is a unit vector for all points in the 3D space `(x,y,z)`, meaning it represents a point on a 2-sphere. The functions `G` and `f` correspond to the polar and azimuthal angles on this sphere, respectively.\n\nThe structure of this mapping reveals its topological nature. For toroidal hopfions, the Hopf charge is the product of two integer winding numbers: a toroidal (or azimuthal) winding number (P) and a poloidal winding number (Q).\n\n1.  **Toroidal Winding (P):** The azimuthal angle `f` of the vector field is identical to the azimuthal angle `atan2(y,x)` of the coordinate system. As one circles the z-axis in the 3D space, the vector field also circles the sphere's equator once. This corresponds to a toroidal winding number of P=1.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding (Q):** The polar angle `G` controls the \"twist\" of the field in the planes containing the z-axis. At the circle defined by `x*x+y*y=0.5` and `z=0`, the value of `r2` is 0, which makes `G = PI`. This corresponds to the south pole of the sphere (`nz = -1`). As the distance from this circle increases, `r2` approaches infinity, causing `G` to approach 0. This corresponds to the north pole (`nz = 1`). This single, complete transition from the south pole to the north pole signifies a poloidal winding number of Q=1.\n\nThe Hopf charge is the product of these winding numbers, `H = P * Q = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nAn alternative way to understand the Hopf charge is as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the sphere. For instance, the preimage of the south pole (`nz=-1`) is the circle `x*x+y*y=0.5, z=0`. The preimage of any point on the equator is a closed loop that interlinks with this circle exactly once, confirming that the linking number, and therefore the Hopf charge, is 1.\n\nWhile the Whitehead formula provides a formal method for calculating the Hopf charge via integration, it is a complex calculation. For well-structured fields like the one given, identifying the topological characteristics provides a direct and insightful path to the solution. The constants `0.5` and `10` define the physical dimensions of the hopfion but do not alter its fundamental topological charge.\n\n<<<1>>>"
