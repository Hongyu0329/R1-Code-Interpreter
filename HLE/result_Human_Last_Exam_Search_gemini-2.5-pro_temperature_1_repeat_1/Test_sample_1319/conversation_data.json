    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Parnassus.\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in the epic poem, but in terms of elevation, Mount Parnassus stands as the highest after Mount Olympus. Mount Parnassus, a mountain in central Greece, has an elevation of 2,457 meters (8,061 feet). This makes it slightly taller than Mount Ida on the island of Crete, which is also mentioned in the *Iliad* and has a height of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet).\n\nOther mountains noted in the *Iliad* include a second Mount Ida in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), from which the gods are said to have observed the Trojan War. This Mount Ida is lower in elevation, at 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). Also mentioned are Mount Othrys, with a height of 1,726 meters (5,663 feet), and Mount Pelion, which reaches 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n\nFor comparison, Mount Olympus, the mythical home of the gods, is the highest mountain in Greece, with its highest peak, Mytikas, reaching 2,917 meters (9,570 feet).\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
