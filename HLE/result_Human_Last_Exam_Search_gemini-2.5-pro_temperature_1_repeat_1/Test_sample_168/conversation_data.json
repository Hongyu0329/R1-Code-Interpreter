    "The sound produced by a human muscle twitch, also known as phonomyography, is a low-frequency vibration. Research shows that these sounds are typically in the range of 10 to 70 Hz, with most of the energy falling below 20 Hz, which is classified as infrasound.\n\nTo determine which animal might hear this, we must look at the hearing ranges of the animals listed:\n\n*   **Human (E):** The typical human hearing range is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Since most of the sound from a muscle twitch is below 20 Hz, it is generally inaudible to humans, though it can sometimes be heard by pressing an ear directly against a contracting muscle.\n*   **Dog (A):** A dog's hearing range is roughly 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. Their low-frequency hearing is not sensitive enough to pick up sounds in the infrasound range where muscle twitches primarily occur.\n*   **Bat (B):** Bats are specialists in high-frequency sound, using ultrasound for echolocation, often above 20,000 Hz. They are not adapted to hear very low-frequency sounds.\n*   **Whale (D):** Many baleen whales are known to communicate using very low-frequency sounds, some of which are in the infrasound range. While they possess the ability to hear these frequencies, the context of hearing a human muscle twitch makes them a less likely answer than an animal that might be in closer proximity in a different environment.\n*   **Herring (C):** The herring family (Clupeidae) are known as hearing specialists. Their hearing is sensitive to low frequencies, with some members of the family able to detect sounds down to 5 Hz. Studies show their hearing range starts around 30 Hz and goes up to 4-5 kHz. This puts the sound of a muscle twitch squarely within their range of hearing.\n\nGiven its specialized ability to detect low-frequency and infrasonic sounds, the herring is the animal from the choices provided that would most likely be able to hear a human muscle twitch.\n\n<<<C>>>"
