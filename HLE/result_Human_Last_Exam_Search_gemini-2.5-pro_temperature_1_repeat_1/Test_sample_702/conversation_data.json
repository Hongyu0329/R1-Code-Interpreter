    "The map in question is a well-known homotopy equivalence in algebraic topology. Its connectivity is therefore infinite.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n1.  **Path Space Fibrations:** For any pointed topological space `X`, there is a standard fibration known as the path space fibration:\n    `ΩX → PX → X`\n    Here, `PX` is the space of all paths in `X` starting at the basepoint, and `ΩX` is the loop space of `X` (the fiber over the basepoint). A key property is that the total space `PX` is contractible. For `X = S^n`, the sphere, we have the fibrations:\n    *   `ΩS⁴ → PS⁴ → S⁴`\n    *   `ΩS⁶ → PS⁶ → S⁶`\n    where `PS⁴` and `PS⁶` are contractible.\n\n2.  **Fiber of a Smash Product of Maps:** Consider the smash product of the two projection maps, `p₄ ∧ p₆: PS⁴ ∧ PS⁶ → S⁴ ∧ S⁶`. There is a general result that identifies the homotopy fiber of such a smash product. The homotopy fiber of `p₄ ∧ p₆` is homotopy equivalent to the join of the individual fibers, `ΩS⁴ * ΩS⁶`.\n\n3.  **The Join and Suspension:** The join `A * B` is homotopy equivalent to the suspension of the smash product, `Σ(A ∧ B)`. Therefore, the homotopy fiber of `p₄ ∧ p₆` is homotopy equivalent to `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`.\n\n4.  **The Resulting Fibration:** The construction above yields a homotopy fibration sequence:\n    `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → PS⁴ ∧ PS⁶ → S⁴ ∧ S⁶`\n\n5.  **Contractible Total Space:** The total space of this fibration, `PS⁴ ∧ PS⁶`, is the smash product of two contractible spaces. Therefore, it is also contractible.\n\n6.  **The Homotopy Equivalence:** A fundamental theorem in homotopy theory states that for any fibration of the form `F → E → B`, where the total space `E` is contractible, the canonical map from the fiber `F` to the loop space of the base `ΩB` is a homotopy equivalence.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Applying this theorem to our fibration, we find that the map\n    `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`\n    is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nA homotopy equivalence is a map that induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups. The connectivity of a map `f: A → B` is defined as the largest integer `k` such that the induced maps on homotopy groups `πᵢ(A) → πᵢ(B)` are isomorphisms for `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. Since a homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms for all `i`, its connectivity is infinite.\n\n<<<∞>>>"
