    "Until the mid-20th century, a distinctive feature of the Piazza della Rotonda was a circular tram line that encircled the central fountain. This unique architectural element was removed by the city administration around 1950 as part of a broader effort to modernize Rome's transportation system and shift from trams to buses in the historic center.\n\nThe decision to remove the tram tracks from the piazza was part of a larger trend in post-war Rome that saw the gradual decommissioning of tram lines within the ancient core of the city. This was done to accommodate the increasing volume of automobile traffic and to alter the aesthetic of the city's historic squares. While the tram system had been a prominent feature of Roman life for decades, the mid-century move towards buses led to the dismantling of much of the infrastructure in the city's central areas, including the notable tracks in the Piazza della Rotonda.\n\n<<<A circular tram line that encircled the central fountain.>>>"
