**Two Subsets:** The set of all rational numbers **ℚ** and the set of rational numbers in the interval (0, 1), **ℚ ∩ (0, 1)**.

**Equivalence Relation:** For any two subsets A and B of the rational numbers, A is equivalent to B if and only if A is homeomorphic to a subset of B and B is homeomorphic to a subset of A.

**Number of Equivalence Classes:** Continuum many (c).
