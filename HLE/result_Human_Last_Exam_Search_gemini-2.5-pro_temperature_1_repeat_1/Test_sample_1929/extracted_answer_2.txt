The product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is primarily **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene** via a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction), with the potential for the formation of **2-(2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)ethene** through a [2+2] cycloaddition as well.
