The optimal Spreading Factor is SF9 and the optimal Transmission Power is the lowest possible level that achieves the required 7 dB SNR at the gateway, which is likely in the range of 6 dBm to 10 dBm depending on the specific path loss. For the purpose of providing a concrete answer, we select 8 dBm as a representative value in an urban environment.
