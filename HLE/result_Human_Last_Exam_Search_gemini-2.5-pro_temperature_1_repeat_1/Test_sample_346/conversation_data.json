    "Answering this question requires breaking down the complex SKI combinator expression into its constituent parts, evaluating them, and then combining them according to the rules of SKI calculus and Church numeral arithmetic.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Expression\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's identify the key sub-expressions:\n\n*   **Successor Function (`Succ`)**: The expression `S(S(K S) K)` is the standard SKI representation of the successor function for Church numerals.\n*   **Church Numeral 2 (`2_c`)**: The expression `S(I)(I)` reduces to the Church numeral for 2. This can be shown by applying it to a function `f` and an argument `x`:\n    `S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x) = 2_c f x`\n*   **The Term `Succ I`**: Applying the successor function to the identity combinator `I`. The `Succ` function is `λn.λf.λx. f(n f x)`. Applying it to `I`:\n    `Succ I f x = f (I f x) = f (f x) = 2_c f x`.\n    Therefore, `Succ I` is equivalent to the Church numeral 2 (`2_c`).\n*   **The Term `Succ (S(I)(I))`**: This is the successor of the Church numeral 2, which is the Church numeral 3 (`3_c`).\n\nSubstituting these into the original expression, we get a simplified form:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2_c))))(3_c))`\n\n### 2. Reduction of the SKI Expression\n\nWe can reduce this expression by applying the reduction rule for the `S` combinator: `S x y z = x z (y z)`. The expression is left-associative, so `S x y z` is `((S x) y) z`.\n\nLet the entire expression be `E`.\n`E = S(I) (S(I)(S(I)(K(2_c)))) (3_c)`\n\nApplying the `S` rule where `x=I`, `y=S(I)(S(I)(K(2_c)))`, and `z=3_c`:\n`E = I (3_c) ( (S(I)(S(I)(K(2_c)))) (3_c) )`\nSince `I a = a`, this simplifies to:\n`E = 3_c ( (S(I)(S(I)(K(2_c)))) (3_c) )`\n\nNow we reduce the inner part, `S(I)(S(I)(K(2_c))) (3_c)`:\n`= I (3_c) ( (S(I)(K(2_c))) (3_c) )`\n`= 3_c ( (S(I)(K(2_c))) (3_c) )`\n\nAnd again for the innermost part, `S(I)(K(2_c)) (3_c)`:\n`= I (3_c) ( (K(2_c)) (3_c) )`\n`= 3_c ( K(2_c) (3_c) )`\n\nThe `K` combinator rule is `K x y = x`. So, `K(2_c) (3_c) = 2_c`.\n\nSubstituting back, we get the fully reduced expression in terms of Church numerals:\n`E = 3_c ( 3_c ( 3_c ( 2_c ) ) )`\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Church Numeral Expression\n\nThe application of one Church numeral `m` to another `n`, written as `m n`, corresponds to exponentiation, evaluating to `n^m`.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression `3_c ( 3_c ( 3_c ( 2_c ) ) )` from the inside out:\n\n1.  `3_c (2_c)` evaluates to `2^3 = 8`. So this is `8_c`.\n2.  `3_c (8_c)` evaluates to `8^3 = 512`. So this is `512_c`.\n3.  `3_c (512_c)` evaluates to `512^3`.\n\nSo, the integer `n` represented by the expression is `512^3`.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nWe need to find `log_2(n)` where `n = 512^3`.\n\nFirst, express 512 as a power of 2:\n`512 = 2^9`\n\nNow substitute this into the expression for `n`:\n`n = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27`\n\nFinally, calculate `log_2(n)`:\n`log_2(2^27) = 27`\n\n<<<27>>>"
