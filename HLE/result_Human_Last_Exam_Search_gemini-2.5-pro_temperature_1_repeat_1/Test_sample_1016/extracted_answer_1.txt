The number of iterations `N` required for the Schwarz Relaxation Method to converge up to time `T` is given by the formula:

`N = ceil(cT / 2M)`

where:
*   `c` is the propagation speed of the wave.
*   `T` is the time instant up to which convergence is required.
*   `M` is the size of the overlap between the subdomains (`M = b - a`).
*   `ceil()` is the ceiling function, which rounds a number up to the next highest integer.

### Derivation
The convergence of the Schwarz method for the wave equation is determined by the propagation of information across the subdomains. The method is considered converged up to a time `T` when the solution is exact for all `t ≤ T`, meaning the effects of the initial arbitrary interface conditions have been fully replaced by the correct information propagating from the physical boundaries and across the subdomains.

The process, using a Gauss-Seidel update scheme (where the update of the right subdomain `Ω₂` immediately uses the result from the left subdomain `Ω₁` within the same iteration), can be analyzed by tracking the time for which the solution becomes correct at the interfaces.

1.  **Initial State (Before iteration 0):** The solution is correct for `t=0` based on the initial conditions, but for `t > 0` it is incorrect due to the arbitrary guess for the boundary conditions at the interfaces. Let's say the time of correctness at the right interface `b` is `T_b = 0`.

2.  **After Iteration 0:**
    *   The solver for `Ω₁` runs. Information from the boundary at `x=b` propagates leftwards to `x=a`. This takes a time of `M/c`.
    *   The solver for `Ω₂` runs, using the just-computed values at `x=a`. This new "correct" information propagates rightwards from `a` to `b`, which also takes `M/c`.
    *   Therefore, after one full iteration (updating both domains), the time for which the boundary condition at `b` is correct has advanced by `2 * M/c`. The time of correctness is now `T_b = 2M/c`.

3.  **After Iteration `k`:**
    *   Following the logic, after each full iteration, the time for which the solution is correct advances by `2M/c`.
    *   Let `N` be the total number of iterations performed (indexed `0, 1, ..., N-1`).
    *   After `N` iterations, the total time for which the solution is guaranteed to be correct is `N * (2M/c)`.

4.  **Convergence Condition:**
    *   To have convergence up to the time instant `T`, we require the time of correctness to be at least `T`.
    *   `N * (2M/c) ≥ T`
    *   `N ≥ T / (2M/c)`
    *   `N ≥ cT / (2M)`

Since the number of iterations `N` must be an integer, we take the ceiling of the result, which gives the final formula.
