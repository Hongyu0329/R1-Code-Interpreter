    "This puzzle involves a transformation rule applied to a grid of numbers. Let's deduce the rule from the given examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation Rule**\n\nThe core of the transformation in both examples is that a '2' changes to a '0', and a '0' elsewhere changes to a '2'. This suggests the '2' is \"moving\" to a location occupied by a '0'.\n\nLet's represent the inputs as 0-indexed grids:\n\n**Example A:**\n*   Input_A:\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 2 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   The '2' is at position `(row=1, col=1)`.\n*   Output_A:\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   The '2' moved from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`. The original '2' became a '0', and the '0' at the destination became a '2'. The destination `(0,0)` is a neighbor of the original position `(1,1)`. The direction of movement is Top-Left `(row-1, col-1)`.\n\n**Example B:**\n*   Input_B:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   The '2' is at position `(3,6)`.\n*   Output_B:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   The '2' moved from `(3,6)` to `(2,7)`. Again, the destination was a neighboring '0'. The direction of movement is Top-Right `(row-1, col+1)`.\n\n**Identifying the Pattern**\n\nThe direction of the '2's movement appears to depend on the parity (odd or even) of its coordinates.\n*   In A, the '2' is at `(1,4)` (odd row, odd column). It moves Top-Left.\n*   In B, the '2' is at `(3,6)` (odd row, even column). It moves Top-Right.\n\nThis suggests a rule based on coordinate parity:\n*   If '2' is at `(odd, odd)`: Move Top-Left `(-1, -1)`.\n*   If '2' is at `(odd, even)`: Move Top-Right `(-1, +1)`.\n*   If '2' is at `(even, odd)`: We can extrapolate the pattern to be Bottom-Left `(+1, -1)`.\n*   If '2' is at `(even, even)`: We can extrapolate the pattern to be Bottom-Right `(+1, +1)`.\n\n**Solving for Input_C**\n\nNow, we apply this rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   Input_C: `000000,011120,111111`\n*   As a grid:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n1.  The '2' is located at `(row=1, col=4)`.\n2.  The row index `1` is odd, and the column index `4` is even.\n3.  According to our rule for `(odd, even)`, the '2' moves Top-Right to `(row-1, col+1)`, which is `(0,5)`.\n4.  The value at the destination `(0,5)` in the input grid is '0', so the move is valid.\n5.  The '2' at `(1,4)` becomes a '0', and the '0' at `(0,5)` becomes a '2'.\n\n*   **Row 1 (index 0):** `000000` changes to `000002`.\n*   **Row 2 (index 1):** `011120` changes to `011100`.\n*   **Row 3 (index 2):** `111111` remains unchanged.\n\nCombining these new rows gives the final output.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
