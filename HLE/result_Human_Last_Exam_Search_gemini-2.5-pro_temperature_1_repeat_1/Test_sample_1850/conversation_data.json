    "John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* mentions two historical saints by name or by clear, unmistakable reference.\n\nThe most direct mention is of **Saint Peter**, which occurs in Book III. In a satirical passage describing the \"Paradise of Fools,\" Milton depicts a chaotic scene where \"Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls.\" He continues, \"And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems To wait them with his Keys...\". This reference is part of a broader critique of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe second saint referenced is **Saint John the Apostle**. In the opening of Book IV, Milton alludes to him as \"he who saw Th' Apocalyps,\" a clear reference to John's vision recorded in the Book of Revelation. The line reads: \"O for that warning voice, which he who saw Th' Apocalyps, heard cry in Heav'n aloud.\" This indirect naming was a common literary device of the period.\n\nWhile the writings of other saints, such as Saint Paul, are alluded to throughout the poem, their names are not explicitly mentioned in the text of *Paradise Lost*. For instance, discussions of Christian doctrine within the poem often draw on Pauline theology without naming Paul himself.\n\nTherefore, the total number of historical saints mentioned by name or clear reference in *Paradise Lost* is two.\n\n<<<2>>>"
