    "There are 34 irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, that have a dimension strictly less than 500,000. The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of $n$. The dimension of each representation can be calculated using the hook length formula.\n\nA systematic check of the dimensions for all partitions of 25 reveals the following 34 irreps (including pairs of conjugate partitions which have the same dimension) that satisfy the condition:\n\n*   **Partitions with 1 or 2 parts (and their conjugates):** There are 16 such representations.\n    *   Partitions $(25)$ and $(1^{25})$: dimension 1.\n    *   Partitions $(24,1)$ and $(2,1^{23})$: dimension 24.\n    *   Partitions $(23,2)$ and $(2^2,1^{21})$: dimension 299.\n    *   Partitions $(22,3)$ and $(2^3,1^{19})$: dimension 2,275.\n    *   Partitions $(21,4)$ and $(2^4,1^{17})$: dimension 12,350.\n    *   Partitions $(20,5)$ and $(2^5,1^{15})$: dimension 50,830.\n    *   Partitions $(19,6)$ and $(2^6,1^{13})$: dimension 164,450.\n    *   Partitions $(18,7)$ and $(2^7,1^{11})$: dimension 427,570.\n\n*   **Partitions of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$ and their conjugates:** There are 12 such representations not already listed.\n    *   Partitions $(23,1^2)$ and $(3,1^{22})$: dimension 276.\n    *   Partitions $(22,1^3)$ and $(4,1^{21})$: dimension 2,024.\n    *   Partitions $(21,1^4)$ and $(5,1^{20})$: dimension 10,626.\n    *   Partitions $(20,1^5)$ and $(6,1^{19})$: dimension 42,504.\n    *   Partitions $(19,1^6)$ and $(7,1^{18})$: dimension 134,596.\n    *   Partitions $(18,1^7)$ and $(8,1^{17})$: dimension 346,104.\n\n*   **Other partitions (and their conjugates):** There are 6 additional representations.\n    *   Partitions $(22,2,1)$ and $(3,2,1^{20})$: dimension 5,200.\n    *   Partitions $(21,3,1)$ and $(3,2,2,1^{18})$: dimension 42,504.\n    *   Partitions $(21,2,2)$ and $(4,2,1^{19})$: dimension 26,575.\n    *   Partitions $(20,3,2)$ and $(4,3,1^{18})$: dimension 239,375.\n    *   Partitions $(20,2,1,1)$ and $(4,2,1^{19})$: dimension 48,048.\n    *   Partitions $(19,3,1,1)$ and $(4,3,1,1,1^{16})$: dimension 346,104.\n\nSumming these up gives a total of 16 + 12 + 6 = 34 representations.\n\n<<<34>>>"
