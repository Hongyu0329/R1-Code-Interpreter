    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification for this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Properties of the function *f*\n\nAny function $f$ that is a solution to the equation must be injective (one-to-one). To see this, assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which by the given equation means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is itself injective, it follows that $x_1 = x_2$.\n\nA continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic, meaning it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### 2. The case where *f* is strictly decreasing\n\nIf $f$ were strictly decreasing, it would have to have a unique fixed point, a value $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. Applying the function $f$ to this fixed point gives $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n\nHowever, according to the problem's equation, we must also have $f(f(x_0)) = e^{x_0}$. This leads to the requirement that $x_0 = e^{x_0}$. The equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions, which can be seen by observing that the graphs of $y=x$ and $y=e^x$ never intersect. This contradiction proves that no strictly decreasing continuous solutions exist.\n\n### 3. The case where *f* is strictly increasing\n\nIf $f$ is strictly increasing, its composition with itself, $f(f(x))$, will also be strictly increasing. This is consistent with the right side of the equation, $e^x$, which is a strictly increasing function. Therefore, solutions must be strictly increasing.\n\nIt can be shown that for any strictly increasing continuous function $g(x)$ that satisfies $g(x) > x$ for all real $x$, the functional equation $f(f(x)) = g(x)$ has infinitely many continuous solutions. The function $g(x) = e^x$ satisfies the condition $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe existence of these numerous solutions comes from the freedom to define the function on an initial interval. The general method for constructing a solution involves these steps:\n1.  Choose a value $c$ such that $0 < c < 1$. Let $f(0) = c$. From the original equation, it follows that $f(c) = f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$.\n2.  Define $f(x)$ on the interval $[0, c]$ as an arbitrary continuous and strictly increasing function $\\phi(x)$ such that $\\phi(0) = c$ and $\\phi(c) = 1$.\n3.  This initial definition of $f$ on $[0,c]$ can be extended uniquely to define $f$ over all of $\\mathbb{R}$ by repeatedly using the relations $f(x) = e^{\\phi^{-1}(x)}$ for $x \\in [c, 1]$ and $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$.\n\nThe number of ways to choose the initial function $\\phi(x)$ corresponds to the number of homeomorphisms (continuous, strictly increasing bijections) between the intervals $[0, c]$ and $[c, 1]$. The set of such homeomorphisms has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. Each distinct choice of $\\phi$ generates a different valid solution for $f(x)$ over the entire real line.\n\n### 4. Cardinality of the solution set\n\nFrom the construction process, we can generate a set of solutions whose size is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$. The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is itself known to have the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on the dense set of rational numbers, and the number of functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince the number of solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and can be no more than $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the set of solutions must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the set of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).>>>"
