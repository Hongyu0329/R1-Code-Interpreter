    "The user wants to find the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix.\n\nThe provided matrix is:\n```\nA = [[2, -1, -1],\n     [-1, 2, -1],\n     [-1, -1, 2]]\n```\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix `[[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]` is calculated as `a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\nFor the given matrix A:\na = 2, b = -1, c = -1\nd = -1, e = 2, f = -1\ng = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nThe context \"Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13\" seems to be extra information. The search results discuss the Markov equation x² + y² + z² = 3xyz. The solutions to this Diophantine equation are called Markov numbers. A Markov triple (x, y, z) is a set of three Markov numbers that solve the equation. The search results also indicate that Markov numbers can be generated from a tree structure starting from (1,1,1). One of the examples of a Markov triple is (1, 5, 13). This relates to the `m_{1/2} = 13` part of the query.\n\nThe term \"quiver\" in mathematics refers to a directed graph. The adjacency matrix of a quiver is a matrix that represents the connections between its vertices. The specific matrix A is related to the study of these Markov numbers, often appearing in the context of cluster algebras and representation theory associated with the Markov equation.\n\nThe crucial part of the query is the computation of the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix A. The calculation confirms that the determinant is 0.\n\nFinal Answer: The determinant is 0.\n<<<0>>>"
