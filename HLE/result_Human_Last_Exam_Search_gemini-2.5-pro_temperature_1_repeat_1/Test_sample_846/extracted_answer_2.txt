To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape. At sunrise, when exposed to the UV light in sunlight, the table should bend or fold into a more compact, bent shape, mimicking the *trans*-to-*cis* isomerization of the azobenzene molecule. At sunset, in the absence of UV light, the table should straighten back out to its original, elongated form, representing the molecule's relaxation back to its more stable *trans* state.
