    "The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$ is the direct product of three copies of the cyclic group of order 2, which is denoted as $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the group.\n\n### 1. Define the Tower of Fields\n\nLet's define a sequence of field extensions:\n1.  The base field is $K_0 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  Let $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The degree of this extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\n3.  Let $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the degree of the extension is $[K_2:K_1] = 2$. By the Tower Law, the total degree is $[K_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_2:K_1][K_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 2 = 4$. The Galois group of $K_2/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n4.  The full field is $L = K_2\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}\\right)$. Let $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Note that $\\beta$ is an element of $K_2$. Therefore, $L = K_2(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\n\n### 2. Determine the Degree of the Final Extension\n\nThe degree of the extension $L/K_2$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ is already in $K_2$ (i.e., if $\\beta$ is a perfect square in $K_2$). It is 2 if $\\beta$ is not a perfect square in $K_2$.\n\nTo check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, we can use a norm argument. Consider the subfield $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and the norm map $N_{K_2/K_1}: K_2 \\to K_1$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K_2/K_1$ is $\\sigma$, which sends $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixes $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe norm of $\\beta$ is:\n$N_{K_2/K_1}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta)$\n$N_{K_2/K_1}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$N_{K_2/K_1}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2)$\n$N_{K_2/K_1}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9 - 3)$\n$N_{K_2/K_1}(\\beta) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\n\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $K_2$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in K_2$, then its norm $N_{K_2/K_1}(\\beta)$ would have to be a square in $K_1$.\n$N_{K_2/K_1}(\\beta) = N_{K_2/K_1}(\\gamma^2) = (N_{K_2/K_1}(\\gamma))^2$.\nThe element $N_{K_2/K_1}(\\gamma)$ belongs to $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This means that $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nFor $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's assume it is: $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6$ for some $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 6$.\nThis implies $2ab\\sqrt{2} = 0$, so either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n*   If $a=0$, then $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3 \\implies b=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   If $b=0$, then $a^2=6 \\implies a=\\pm\\sqrt{6}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $N_{K_2/K_1}(\\beta) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is not a square in $K_1$. This proves that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K_2$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ over $K_2$ is $x^2 - \\beta$, and the degree of the extension is $[L:K_2] = 2$.\n\nThe total degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is:\n$[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_2] \\cdot [K_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n### 3. Identify the Galois Group Structure\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. We need to determine which of the five groups of order 8 it is ($C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$, or $Q_8$).\n\nThe extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension as it is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^8 - 24x^6 + 144x^4 - 288x^2 + 144)$, which has roots $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$.\n\nLet's identify the generators of the Galois group. The group contains automorphisms corresponding to the extensions we built. The automorphisms are determined by their action on $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\sqrt{\\beta}$.\n1.  $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, fixes $\\sqrt{3}$.\n2.  $\\sigma_3$: $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$, fixes $\\sqrt{2}$.\n3.  $\\tau$: $\\sqrt{\\beta} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{\\beta}$, fixes $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nEach of these generators squares to the identity element, meaning they are all of order 2.\n*   $\\sigma_2^2$ sends $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -(-\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$, so $\\sigma_2^2=id$.\n*   $\\sigma_3^2$ sends $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -(-\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$, so $\\sigma_3^2=id$.\n*   $\\tau^2$ sends $\\sqrt{\\beta} \\mapsto -(-\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\sqrt{\\beta}$, so $\\tau^2=id$.\n\nFurthermore, these automorphisms commute with each other. For example, consider $\\sigma_2$ and $\\tau$:\n*   $\\tau(\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{\\beta})) = \\tau(\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}) = -\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\n*   $\\sigma_2(\\tau(\\sqrt{\\beta})) = \\sigma_2(-\\sqrt{\\beta}) = -\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}) = -\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\nSince their actions on the generators of the field extension are identical, $\\sigma_2\\tau = \\tau\\sigma_2$. Similar calculations show that all three generators commute.\n\nSince the Galois group is generated by three distinct commuting elements of order 2, the group must be abelian. The only abelian groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, and $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$. Since all elements (except the identity) in our group have order 2, it cannot be $C_8$ or $C_4 \\times C_2$. Therefore, the group must be $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n<<<C_2 x C_2 x C_2>>>"
