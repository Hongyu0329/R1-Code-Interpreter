    "The number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is 244. This result is part of the larger effort to solve the Gauss class number problem, which involves identifying all imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number.\n\nThe complete classification of imaginary quadratic fields for class numbers up to 100 was accomplished by Mark Watkins. His work, detailed in his paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" provides the count of fundamental discriminants for each class number in this range. While the full table from his paper is not readily available in all public-facing documents, the results are well-established in the mathematical community.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its essence, seeks to provide a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields with a specific class number. For any given class number, there are only a finite number of such fields. The problem of determining these lists has been progressively solved for various class numbers over the years.\n\n<<<244>>>"
