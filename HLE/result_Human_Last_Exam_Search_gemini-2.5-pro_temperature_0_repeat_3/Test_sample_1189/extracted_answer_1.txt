Let \( f_m \) be the number of sets for a given \( n \). The value of \( f_m \) is defined by the recurrence relation with the base cases \( f_0 = 1 \) and \( f_k = 0 \) for \( k < 0 \). For \( m \ge 1 \), the recurrence is:
\[ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2} \right) \]
