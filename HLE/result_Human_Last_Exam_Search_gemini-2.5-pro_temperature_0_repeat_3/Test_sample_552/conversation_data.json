    "**Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.**\n\nEinstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), is notable for its lack of formal citations to the work of other scientists, a characteristic it shares with his other groundbreaking papers of that year.\n\nWhile Einstein was undoubtedly influenced by the broader scientific context of his time, including the developing kinetic theory of heat championed by physicists like Ludwig Boltzmann, his paper does not contain a bibliography or footnotes referencing specific lectures or publications. In the paper itself, Einstein mentions the phenomenon of Brownian motion but notes the imprecise nature of the data available to him, precluding a definitive judgment on whether the movements he was describing were identical to it.\n\nThe style of scientific papers in the early 20th century was not always as rigorous with citations as is standard today. However, the absence of references in Einstein's 1905 papers is a well-documented historical fact. His work on Brownian motion was a theoretical investigation that provided a mathematical framework to explain the phenomenon, which was later experimentally verified by Jean Perrin. This confirmation was seen as strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules."
