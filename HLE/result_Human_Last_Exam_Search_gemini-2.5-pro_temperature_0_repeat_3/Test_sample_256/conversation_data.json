    "The symmetry group for the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₁ in Schoenflies notation. This is based on the data provided by Eckard Specht's \"packomania.com\", a comprehensive database of circle packing information.\n\nIn this database, the symmetry group for each packing is listed. For cases where the packing has no rotational or reflectional symmetry, the symmetry group is designated as C₁, representing a trivial symmetry. The entry for 1135 circles does not specify a higher symmetry group, thus defaulting to C₁.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
