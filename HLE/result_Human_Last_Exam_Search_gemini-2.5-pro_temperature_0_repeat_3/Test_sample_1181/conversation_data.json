    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, the character who discusses missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth and suggests a way to replicate it is Snaut.\n\nIn a conversation with the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, Snaut suggests attaching strips of paper to the air vents. He explains that at night, the fluttering paper sounds like the rustling of leaves. Snaut attributes this idea to the deceased scientist Gibarian, calling it a simple yet brilliant invention. He also reveals that both he and the seemingly cynical Sartorius have adopted this practice, with Sartorius even hiding his paper strips in a closet. This act of secretly recreating a sound from Earth highlights the profound sense of nostalgia and loss experienced by the crew of the space station.\n\n<<<C>>>"
