    "The problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n\nLet G be a graph with 128 vertices. A clique is a set of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. An induced subgraph on a set of vertices S is the graph formed by S and all the edges that connect pairs of vertices within S in the original graph.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the relationship between induced cliques of different sizes within the same graph.\n\n1.  **Existence of smaller induced cliques:** If a graph G has an induced clique of size *k*, this means there is a set of *k* vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set. If we take any subset of these *k* vertices, say of size *j* (where 1 ≤ *j* < *k*), these *j* vertices will also be all connected to each other. Therefore, the subgraph induced by this subset of *j* vertices is a clique of size *j*. This fundamental property means that if a graph contains an induced clique of size *k*, it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to *k*.\n\n2.  **The set of clique sizes:** From the above point, the set of all possible sizes of induced cliques in any graph G is always of the form {1, 2, 3, ..., *k<sub>max</sub>*}, where *k<sub>max</sub>* is the size of the largest clique in G. The number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to *k<sub>max</sub>*. The size of the largest clique in a graph is known as its clique number, denoted by ω(G).\n\n3.  **Maximizing the number of clique sizes:** The problem is now simplified to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices. A clique in a graph is a subset of its vertices. Consequently, the size of a clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph with 128 vertices, the clique number can be at most 128.\n\n4.  **Achieving the maximum:** This maximum value is achieved by the complete graph, K<sub>128</sub>. In a complete graph on 128 vertices, all 128 vertices are connected to each other, forming a clique of size 128. Based on the first point, this graph also contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. For any integer *k* between 1 and 128, any subset of *k* vertices from K<sub>128</sub> will induce a clique of size *k*.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
