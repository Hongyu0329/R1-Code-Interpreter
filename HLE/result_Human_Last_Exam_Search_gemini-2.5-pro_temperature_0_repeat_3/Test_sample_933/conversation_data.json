    "The most common and efficient method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. This direct combination is typically performed in a nickel vessel, which is resistant to fluorine corrosion.\n\nThe reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of 400°C with a xenon to fluorine molar ratio of 1:5. A patent for the process specifies a temperature range between 350°C and 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for an effective reaction. While other synthesis methods exist, such as using an electric discharge or specific oxidizing agents like chromium(V) fluoride at 120°C, these often result in significant impurities like Xenon difluoride (XeF₂) or are not the primary method for efficient production. The direct thermal method at 400°C is widely cited as the standard for producing good yields of XeF₄.\n\nTherefore, based on the available synthesis methods, 400°C is the coldest temperature from the choices provided at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
