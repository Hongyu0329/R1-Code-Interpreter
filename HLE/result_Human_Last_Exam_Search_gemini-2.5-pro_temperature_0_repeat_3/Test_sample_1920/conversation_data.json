    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Factor the conductor**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nA search reveals that $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$. To confirm that 7657 is a prime number, we can test for divisibility by primes up to $\\sqrt{7657} \\approx 87.5$. A quick check shows it is not divisible by small primes, and we can confirm it is prime.\n\n**2. Conditions for a primitive character of order 6**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2$, where $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $p_1$ and $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $p_2$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2))$. We require this to be 6.\n\nLet $k_1 = \\text{ord}(\\chi_1)$ and $k_2 = \\text{ord}(\\chi_2)$. We need $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2) = 6$. The possible pairs of orders $(k_1, k_2)$ that satisfy this condition are:\n*   (1, 6)\n*   (2, 3)\n*   (2, 6)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (3, 6)\n*   (6, 1)\n*   (6, 2)\n*   (6, 3)\n*   (6, 6)\n\n**3. Count primitive characters for each prime factor**\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters of a specific order $k$ for the conductors $p_1=7$ and $p_2=7657$. For a prime conductor $p$, all non-principal characters are primitive. The group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ (where $k$ divides $p-1$) is given by $\\phi(k)$.\n\n*   **For conductor $p_1 = 7$**:\n    The order of the character group is $\\phi(7) = 6$. The possible orders for a character are the divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$ (the principal character, which is not primitive).\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **For conductor $p_2 = 7657$**:\n    The order of the character group is $\\phi(7657) = 7656$. We check if 6 divides 7656: $7656 = 6 \\times 1276$. Since 6 is a divisor, characters of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6 exist.\n    *   Number of characters of order 1: $\\phi(1) = 1$ (not primitive).\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nLet $N_p(k)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $p$ and order $k$.\n*   $N_7(1)=0$, $N_7(2)=1$, $N_7(3)=2$, $N_7(6)=2$.\n*   $N_{7657}(1)=0$, $N_{7657}(2)=1$, $N_{7657}(3)=2$, $N_{7657}(6)=2$.\n\n**4. Combine the counts**\nWe sum the products $N_7(k_1) \\times N_{7657}(k_2)$ for all pairs $(k_1, k_2)$ where $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2) = 6$.\n\n*   $k_1=2, k_2=3$: $N_7(2) \\times N_{7657}(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n*   $k_1=3, k_2=2$: $N_7(3) \\times N_{7657}(2) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n*   $k_1=6, k_2=1$: This case contributes 0 since $N_{7657}(1)=0$.\n*   $k_1=1, k_2=6$: This case contributes 0 since $N_7(1)=0$.\n*   $k_1=6, k_2=2$: $N_7(6) \\times N_{7657}(2) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n*   $k_1=2, k_2=6$: $N_7(2) \\times N_{7657}(6) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n*   $k_1=6, k_2=3$: $N_7(6) \\times N_{7657}(3) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   $k_1=3, k_2=6$: $N_7(3) \\times N_{7657}(6) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   $k_1=6, k_2=6$: $N_7(6) \\times N_{7657}(6) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is the sum of these values:\n$2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20$.\n\n<<<20>>>"
