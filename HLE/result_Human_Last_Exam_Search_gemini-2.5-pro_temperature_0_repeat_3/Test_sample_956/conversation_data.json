    "The solution to the problem is determined by the following steps:\n\n**1. Identification of the Group G**\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations, $a$, $b$, and $c$, acting on a set of 12 elements.\n*   $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$ is an 11-cycle that fixes the element 'z'.\n*   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$ is a permutation of order 4 that also fixes 'z'.\n*   $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$ is a permutation of order 2 that moves all 12 elements.\n\nThe structure of these generators is characteristic of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. The stabilizer of a point in $M_{12}$ is the Mathieu group $M_{11}$. The subgroup of $G$ that fixes the point 'z', denoted $G_z$, is generated by $a$ and $b$. The group generated by an 11-cycle and another suitable permutation on 11 elements is known to be $M_{11}$. The third generator, $c$, which swaps 'z' with another element, extends the group from the stabilizer $M_{11}$ to the full group $M_{12}$. Thus, the group $G$ is isomorphic to the Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n\n**2. Determination of the Schur Multiplier of G**\n\nThe Schur multiplier of a group $G$, denoted $A = M(G)$, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. For the Mathieu group $M_{12}$, the Schur multiplier is a well-established result in group theory. It is the cyclic group of order 2, denoted $C_2$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This was definitively shown by Burgoyne and Fong in 1968, correcting an earlier incorrect result.\n\n**3. Counting the Proper Subgroups of A up to Isomorphism**\n\nThe Schur multiplier is the abelian group $A = C_2$. The subgroups of a group of order 2 are:\n*   The trivial subgroup, containing only the identity element, $\\{e\\}$. Its order is 1.\n*   The group itself, $C_2$. Its order is 2.\n\nA *proper* subgroup is any subgroup of a group except the group itself. Therefore, the only proper subgroup of $C_2$ is the trivial subgroup.\n\nThe question asks for the number of these proper subgroups *up to isomorphism*. All trivial subgroups are isomorphic to each other (they are all isomorphic to the group $C_1$). Since there is only one proper subgroup, there can be only one isomorphism class for the proper subgroups.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 proper subgroup of the Schur multiplier of $G$ up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<1>>>"
