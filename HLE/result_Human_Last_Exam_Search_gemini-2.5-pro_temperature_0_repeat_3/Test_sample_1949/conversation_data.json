    "Of the real-world rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, the three longest are the Ganges, the Don, and the Aras. These rivers are referenced in the text, connecting the narrative of Aeneas to the broader known world of the ancient Romans.\n\nFirst, the **Ganges River**, located in Asia, is the longest among those mentioned. It flows for approximately 2,510 to 2,704 kilometers (about 1,560 to 1,680 miles). Virgil includes the Ganges in the context of the vast and distant lands known to the Romans.\n\nThe second longest is the **Don River**, which flows through modern-day Russia. In antiquity, it was known as the Tanais. Its length is approximately 1,870 kilometers (1,162 miles). The mention of the Tanais in the Aeneid reflects the Roman awareness of the vast Scythian lands to the northeast.\n\nThe third longest river is the **Aras**, referred to by its ancient Greek name, the Araxes. This river flows through modern-day Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran, with a length of about 1,072 kilometers (666 miles). Virgil's reference to the Araxes highlights the eastern frontiers of the world as conceived by the Romans.\n\nOther notable rivers mentioned in the Aeneid include the Tiber, the primary river of Rome, which is significantly shorter at approximately 406 kilometers (252 miles). The Hebrus River (modern Maritsa), located in the Balkans, is also mentioned and has a length of about 480 kilometers (300 miles). The epic also features several mythological rivers of the underworld, such as the Styx, Acheron, Phlegethon, and Cocytus, which do not have literal, measurable lengths.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Ganges, the Don (Tanais), and the Aras (Araxes).>>>"
