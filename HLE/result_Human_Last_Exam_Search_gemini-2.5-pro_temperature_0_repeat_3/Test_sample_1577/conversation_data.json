    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The \"holes\" mentioned in the question refer to boundaries, which can be of two types: smooth (also called closed) or rough (also called open). The GSD is given by 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.\n\nTo determine the number of logical qubits for a surface with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes, we can count the number of independent logical operators. Let's assume the code is on a planar surface (a sphere with punctures), which has a genus of zero.\n\n1.  **Logical Qubits from Rough Boundaries:** A set of *m* rough boundaries allows for the creation of logical operators. Specifically, one can create logical X operators by forming strings of Pauli-X operators that connect pairs of rough boundaries. There are *m-1* such independent operators. The corresponding logical Z operators are loops of Pauli-Z operators that encircle a single rough boundary. This pairing creates *m-1* logical qubits, provided *m* ≥ 1.\n\n2.  **Logical Qubits from Smooth Boundaries:** Similarly, a set of *n* smooth boundaries allows for the creation of logical Z operators by forming strings of Pauli-Z operators connecting pairs of smooth boundaries. There are *n-1* such independent operators. The corresponding logical X operators are loops of Pauli-X operators encircling a single smooth boundary. This creates *n-1* logical qubits, provided *n* ≥ 1.\n\nThe logical operators associated with the rough boundaries commute with those associated with the smooth boundaries. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits *k* is the sum of the qubits from each set of boundaries.\n\nThis leads to the formula for the number of logical qubits:\nk = max(0, m-1) + max(0, n-1)\n\nLet's analyze the answer choices based on this formula. The question asks for the ground space degeneracy, which is 2^k.\n\nIf we assume that the question implies a scenario where there is at least one of each type of hole (i.e., m ≥ 1 and n ≥ 1), the formula for the number of qubits simplifies:\nk = (m-1) + (n-1) = m + n - 2\n\nThis corresponds to a ground space degeneracy of 2^(m+n-2). Let's check this against the provided options.\n\n*   A. 2^(m+n)\n*   B. 2^(m+n-2)\n*   C. 2^(m+n+2)\n*   D. 2^(2m)\n*   E. 2^(2n)\n*   F. 2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)\n\nThe derived degeneracy 2^(m+n-2) matches option B. This formula correctly describes the number of logical qubits for a planar toric code as long as both *m* and *n* are greater than or equal to 1. For cases where one of the counts is zero, the formula `k = max(0, m-1) + max(0, n-1)` should be used, which does not correspond to a single simple expression among the choices. However, given the options, it is most likely that the question assumes the general case where both types of boundaries are present.\n\n<<<B>>>"
