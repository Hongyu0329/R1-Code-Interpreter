    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The equation has no solutions for values of λ that are characteristic values of the integral operator, provided that the free term of the equation is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator.\n\nThe integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`\n\nThe kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. It can be expanded as a finite sum of products of functions of x and y:\n`K(x, y) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\n\nThis allows the integral equation to be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations. The problem of finding the values of λ for which the equation has no solution is equivalent to finding the values of λ for which this linear system is inconsistent.\n\nThis occurs when λ is the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the matrix representing the integral operator. The operator can be represented by an `n x n` matrix `B` in the basis of monomials `{1, x, x², ..., xⁿ⁻¹}`. The entries of this matrix are given by:\n`B_ij = 1 / (n + j - i)` for `i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThis matrix is a non-symmetric Toeplitz matrix. The values of λ for which the homogeneous version of the integral equation has non-trivial solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of this matrix `B`.\n\nFor such values of λ, the inhomogeneous equation `u(x) = 1 + f(x)` (here, `f(x) = 1`) has no solution if the function `f(x)` is not orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation. It can be shown that for this specific problem, this condition is always met.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solutions for values of λ that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `B`.\n\n**Case n=1:**\nThe equation becomes `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`. This leads to the condition `1 - λ = 0`, so `λ = 1`. For this value, no solution exists.\n\n**Case n=2:**\nThe matrix `B` is:\n`B = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`\nThe eigenvalues `μ` are the roots of the characteristic equation `det(B - μI) = 0`, which is `μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0`. The solutions are `μ = (3 ± 2√3) / 6`.\nThe values of λ are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues:\n`λ = 1/μ = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nFor a general integer `n`, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the `n` eigenvalues of the `n x n` Toeplitz matrix `B` with entries `B_ij = 1 / (n + j - i)`. These eigenvalues are real and distinct.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix B with entries B_ij = 1/(n + j - i), where i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
