    "A book of manners was preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\" in the manuscript known as Cotton Caligula A. ii. While not a single, formally titled \"book of manners,\" the manuscript contains a collection of \"courtesy poems\" and other texts that collectively served as a guide to proper conduct and social advancement.\n\nThe manuscript, which dates to the mid-15th century, is considered by scholars to be a \"late-medieval household book\". One scholarly work on the manuscript is even titled \"'Nurtur and good maners make√æ man': The Burgeis in Late-Medieval Household Miscellany BL MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, part 1,\" highlighting the focus on manners within the collection.\n\nThe texts within the manuscript were intended to teach lessons in obedience, covering social, courtly, and chivalric behavior. The inclusion of courtesy poems suggests a purpose of instructing members of a household, including children and servants, on proper etiquette to improve their social standing. Therefore, while you won't find a single text named \"The Book of Manners,\" the function of such a book was fulfilled by a selection of the works preserved together with \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n<<<A collection of courtesy poems and other texts that served as a guide to good manners.>>>"
