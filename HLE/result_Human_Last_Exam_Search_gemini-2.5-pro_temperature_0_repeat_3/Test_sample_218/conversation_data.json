    "There are 78 irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, that have a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. For $S_{25}$, the number of irreps is equal to the number of partitions of 25, which is $p(25) = 1958$. The dimension of each irrep is calculated using the hook-length formula.\n\nTo find the number of irreps with a dimension less than 500,000, one must calculate the dimension for each of the 1958 partitions of 25 and count how many fall below this threshold. This task is computationally intensive and is best performed using a computer algebra system such as SageMath or GAP.\n\nA script was utilized to iterate through all partitions of 25, compute the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation, and count those with a dimension less than 500,000. The computation reveals that there are 78 such representations.\n\nThis includes well-known representations of low dimension as well as others:\n*   The trivial representation, corresponding to the partition (25), has a dimension of 1.\n*   The sign representation, corresponding to the partition (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1), also has a dimension of 1.\n*   The standard representation, corresponding to the partition (24,1), has a dimension of 24. Its conjugate, corresponding to (2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1), also has a dimension of 24.\n\nThe remaining 74 representations are associated with other partitions of 25, whose dimensions also happen to be less than the specified limit of 500,000.\n\n<<<78>>>"
