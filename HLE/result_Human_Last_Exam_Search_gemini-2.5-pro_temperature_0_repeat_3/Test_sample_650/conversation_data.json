    "The computational time complexity of the given algorithm, `IMAG(n, c)`, depends on the cost model used for the arithmetic operations (division and multiplication).\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the number `n` by the base `c` until the quotient becomes zero. The remainders of these divisions form the digits of the number in the new base.\n\n1.  **Number of Iterations**: The `while` loop continues as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0. In each step, the number `x` is effectively divided by `c`. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before the result is less than 1 is given by `log_c(n)`. Therefore, the loop executes `O(log_c(n))` times. Using the change of base formula for logarithms, this is equivalent to `O(log(n) / log(c))`.\n\n2.  **Cost per Iteration**: Inside the loop, the main operations are the integer division `q := ⌊x/c⌋` and the multiplication/subtraction `aᵢ := x - qc`.\n    *   **Uniform Cost Model**: If we assume that each arithmetic operation takes a constant amount of time, `O(1)`, which is a common simplification for numbers that fit within a machine's word size, then the complexity is determined solely by the number of iterations. In this case, the complexity would be `O(log_c n)`.\n    *   **Logarithmic Cost Model (Bit Complexity)**: For arbitrarily large integers, the cost of arithmetic operations depends on the number of bits in the operands. Let `k` be the number of bits in `n` (i.e., `k ≈ log₂(n)`).\n        *   The division of a number `x` by `c` takes time proportional to the product of their bit lengths. The bit length of `x` is at most `O(log n)` and the bit length of `c` is `O(log c)`. So, a single division takes `O(log n * log c)` time.\n        *   The naive algorithm described, which involves repeated division, is generally considered to have a quadratic time complexity.\n\n### Detailed Complexity Calculation (Bit Complexity)\n\n*   **Number of loop iterations**: `O(log_c n)`\n*   **Cost of operations in each iteration**: The dominant operation is the division `x/c`. The number `x` has `O(log n)` bits in the first iteration and decreases. The cost of this division is `O(log(x) * log(c))`.\n*   **Total Complexity**: To get the total complexity, we multiply the number of iterations by the cost of each iteration.\n    *   Total Time ≈ (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration)\n    *   Total Time ≈ `O(log_c n) * O(log n * log c)`\n    *   Total Time ≈ `O( (log n / log c) * (log n * log c) )`\n    *   Total Time ≈ `O((log n)²) `\n\nThe time complexity of converting a number `n` to base `c` using the standard algorithm of repeated division is quadratic in the number of bits of `n`. More advanced algorithms can achieve better performance, such as `O(M(k) log k)` where `k` is the number of bits in `n` and `M(k)` is the time for `k`-bit multiplication, but the algorithm provided is the simpler, quadratic one.\n\n<<<O((log n)² / log c)>>>"
