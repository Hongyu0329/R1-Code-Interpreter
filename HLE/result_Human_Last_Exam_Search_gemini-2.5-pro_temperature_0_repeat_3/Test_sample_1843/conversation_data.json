    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we first need to analyze the structure of such characters.\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n### 2. Decomposition of the Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\nWe are looking for characters of order 6. So, we need:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5)) = 6$.\n\nThis condition implies two things:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n\n### 4. Counting the Choices for Each Component Character\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor with orders that are divisors of 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($p_1^{a_1} = 2^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_1$: 1 (with order 2).\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($p_2^{a_2} = 3^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. A character modulo $3^2$ is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3^1) = 2$. Thus, the primitive characters are those of order 3 or 6. Both 3 and 6 are divisors of 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_2$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7 ($p_3^{a_3} = 7^1$)**: The group of characters modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. A character is primitive if its conductor is 7, which means it is any character other than the principal character (whose conductor is 1). The orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_3$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11 ($p_4^{a_4} = 11^1$)**: The group of characters modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The orders of primitive characters are 2, 5, and 10. We need the order to divide 6. The only possibility is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (with order 2).\n\n*   **Modulo 13 ($p_5^{a_5} = 13^1$)**: The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_5$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 5. Combining the Choices\n\nLet's denote the order of $\\chi_i$ as $k_i$. For any combination of the chosen characters, we have:\n*   $k_1 = 2$.\n*   $k_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n*   $k_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   $k_4 = 2$.\n*   $k_5 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nWe must verify that the lcm of the orders is exactly 6.\n*   Since $k_1 = 2$, the lcm is guaranteed to be a multiple of 2.\n*   Since $k_2$ must be 3 or 6, the lcm is guaranteed to be a multiple of 3.\n*   Therefore, the lcm must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\n*   Furthermore, since every $k_i$ is a divisor of 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\n\nThe only integer that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 is 6 itself. Thus, any combination of the allowed component characters will result in a character of order 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_5$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n"
