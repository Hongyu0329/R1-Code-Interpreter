    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame should be devoid of any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA). There are three possible forward reading frames for any nucleotide sequence.\n\nThe sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n1.  **Frame 1**, starting from the first base (g), contains multiple stop codons (`tag`, `taa`, `tga`) and is therefore incorrect.\n    *   `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`\n\n2.  **Frame 3**, starting from the third base (a), contains a stop codon (`tga`) and is also incorrect.\n    *   `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`\n\n3.  **Frame 2**, starting from the second base (g), is the only frame that is \"open\" (does not contain any stop codons).
