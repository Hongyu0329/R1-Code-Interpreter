    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given in terms of the arctangent of a value $c_4 = \\tan(\\alpha)$. The exact value of $c_4$ was determined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis and is given by the square root of a rational function evaluated at the root of a cubic polynomial.\n\nThe BDF4 method is A($\\alpha$)-stable for the angle $\\alpha = \\vartheta_4$, where $\\tan(\\vartheta_4) = c_4$. The value $c_4^2$ is given by the expression:\n$c_4^2 = f_4(\\tilde{x}_4) = \\frac{4(1-\\tilde{x}_4)^3(8\\tilde{x}_4-5)^2}{(1+\\tilde{x}_4)(12\\tilde{x}_4^2-16\\tilde{x}_4+7)^2}$\n\nHere, $\\tilde{x}_4$ is the unique real root of the cubic polynomial $P_4(x)$ that lies in the interval $(-1, 1)$:\n$P_4(x) = 100x^3 - 240x^2 + 183x - 41 = 0$\n\nThis root, $\\tilde{x}_4$, is approximately 0.396. The resulting angle $\\alpha$ is approximately $73.35^\\circ$. While the root $\\tilde{x}_4$ can be expressed exactly using Cardano's formula, it leads to a very complicated expression. Therefore, the exact value of $\\alpha$ is expressed in terms of $\\arctan$ with its argument defined as above.\n\nThus, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{4(1-\\tilde{x}_4)^3(8\\tilde{x}_4-5)^2}{(1+\\tilde{x}_4)(12\\tilde{x}_4^2-16\\tilde{x}_4+7)^2}}\\right)$, where $\\tilde{x}_4$ is the unique root of $100x^3 - 240x^2 + 183x - 41 = 0$ in the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n\nAn equivalent formulation by Gander and Wanner gives the point on the stability boundary that defines the angle in a different parameterization. They found that the maximum angle is achieved when $t^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}-3}{5}$, where $t = \\tan(\\phi/2)$ and $\\cos(\\phi) = \\tilde{x}_4$. This leads to $\\tilde{x}_4 = \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}-17}{7}$. Substituting this value into the expression for $c_4^2$ would yield the exact value of the tangent squared.\n\nLet's calculate this value. Let $x = \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}-17}{7}$.\n$1-x = \\frac{24-15\\sqrt{2}}{7}$\n$1+x = \\frac{15\\sqrt{2}-10}{7}$\n$8x-5 = \\frac{120\\sqrt{2}-136-35}{7} = \\frac{120\\sqrt{2}-171}{7}$\n$12x^2-16x+7 = 12\\left(\\frac{450 - 510\\sqrt{2} + 289}{49}\\right) - 16\\left(\\frac{15\\sqrt{2}-17}{7}\\right) + 7 = \\frac{12(739-510\\sqrt{2}) - 112(15\\sqrt{2}-17) + 343}{49} = \\frac{8868 - 6120\\sqrt{2} - 1680\\sqrt{2} + 1904 + 343}{49} = \\frac{11115 - 7800\\sqrt{2}}{49}$.\n\nThe calculation becomes exceedingly complex. The implicit definition via the root of the polynomial is the standard way to represent this exact value.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{4(1-\\tilde{x}_4)^3(8\\tilde{x}_4-5)^2}{(1+\\tilde{x}_4)(12\\tilde{x}_4^2-16\\tilde{x}_4+7)^2}}\\right)$, where $\\tilde{x}_4$ is the unique root in $(-1, 1)$ of the polynomial $100x^3 - 240x^2 + 183x - 41 = 0$.>>>"
