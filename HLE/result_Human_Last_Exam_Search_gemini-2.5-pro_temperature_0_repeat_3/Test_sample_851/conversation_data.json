    "To determine the correct answer, we must identify the crystal classes that satisfy all three given conditions:\n1.  **Optically Active:** The crystal must be able to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is possible for all 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes (those that lack a center of inversion).\n2.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure can be superimposed on its mirror image. This means the crystal class must possess a symmetry operation of the second kind, such as a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis (e.g., -4). This excludes the 11 enantiomorphic (chiral) classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, and 432).\n3.  **Non-polar:** The crystal must not have a unique polar axis, which is an axis with different properties at opposite ends. This excludes the 10 polar classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm).\n\nLet's follow a process of elimination:\n\n*   **Start with all 21 non-centrosymmetric classes**, as these are the only ones that can be optically active: 1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, -4, 422, 4mm, -42m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, -6, 622, 6mm, -6m2, 23, 432, -43m.\n*   **Apply the \"achiral\" condition:** We remove the 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes from the list above. The remaining 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes are: m, mm2, -4, 4mm, -42m, 3m, -6, 6mm, -6m2, -43m.\n*   **Apply the \"non-polar\" condition:** From this list of 10, we remove the classes that are polar. The polar classes in this list are m, mm2, 4mm, 3m, and 6mm.\n*   **Final List:** The crystal classes that remain satisfy all three conditions. They are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity. The final list is: **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m**.\n\nNow, let's examine the given answer choices:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** (Note: -62m is an alternative notation for -6m2). All three of these classes are on our final list.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** (Note: 4m should be 4mm). These are all polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both of these classes are on our final list.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral and polar.\n\nBoth choices B and D contain crystal classes that correctly fit all the criteria. However, multiple-choice questions typically have one best answer. Since both are subsets of the full correct list, and there is no further information to distinguish between them, there might be an issue with the question's design. But if forced to choose the most comprehensive correct option among the incorrect ones, both B and D are equally valid subsets. Without additional context or clarification, let's re-examine the provided options. Both B and D are correct subsets of the five possible classes. Let's assume the question seeks any valid set. Both B and D are valid. If we must select one, there is no crystallographic reason to prefer one over the other. However, in the context of a single-best-answer question, let's review the complete list again: -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m. Option B contains three of these classes, while option D contains two.\n\nGiven the options, B represents a larger and more diverse set of the correct classes (covering trigonal/hexagonal and cubic systems).\n\n<<<B>>>"
