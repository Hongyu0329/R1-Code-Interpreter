    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which represent the gravitational field's strength, are derived from this metric.\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry and the static nature of the spacetime, most of the Christoffel symbols are zero. However, there are a number of non-zero components. The non-vanishing Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r = -\\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rt}^t = \\Gamma_{tr}^t = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta = \\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi = \\cot\\theta$\n\nCounting these unique non-zero components, we find there are a total of 9. It is important to remember that the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower two indices ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$), so components like $\\Gamma_{rt}^t$ and $\\Gamma_{tr}^t$ are counted as one.\n\n<<<9>>>"
