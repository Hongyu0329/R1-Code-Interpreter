    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a minimum of 8 essential controls. For the most accurate and reliable results, especially when establishing a new multicolor panel, preparing up to 13 controls is highly recommended.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n**Absolutely Essential Controls (8 tubes):**\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This sample consists of the same cells used in your experiment but without any fluorescent labels. It is crucial for determining the baseline autofluorescence of your cells and setting the initial voltage for your detectors.\n*   **Single-Color Compensation Controls (5 tubes):** You need one single-stained sample for each fluorochrome in your panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750). These controls are used to correct for spectral overlap, which is the spillover of a fluorochrome's signal into a detector intended for another color. These can be prepared using either cells or compensation beads.\n*   **Streptavidin Bead Control (1 tube):** This control contains cells and the streptavidin-fluorochrome conjugate (e.g., Streptavidin-PE) but lacks the biotinylated antibody. This is essential to assess any non-specific binding of the streptavidin conjugate to your cells.\n*   **Viability Dye Control (1 tube):** It is critical to include a viability dye to exclude dead cells from your analysis and sort. Dead cells can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. If the viability dye is one of your five colors, it is already included in the single-color controls. If it is an additional color, a separate single-stain control is needed.\n\n**Highly Recommended Controls for Optimal Gating (an additional 5 tubes):**\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** An FMO control includes all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. For a five-color panel, this would ideally mean five separate FMO controls. These controls are critical for accurately setting the gates to distinguish between positive and negative populations, as they account for the spread of fluorescence from all other colors into the channel of the missing fluorochrome. While you might eventually run only the FMO controls for the most difficult-to-gate populations, it is best practice to run all of them when establishing a new experimental panel.\n\nIn summary, for a robust and well-controlled five-color sorting experiment involving streptavidin beads, you should prepare:\n*   1 Unstained control\n*   5 Single-color compensation controls\n*   1 Streptavidin non-specific binding control\n*   1 Viability dye control\n*   5 FMO controls (recommended)\n\nThis brings the total to **13 control tubes** for the most rigorous experimental setup. A minimal setup would include at least **8 controls** by potentially omitting the full FMO panel in a well-established protocol, though this is not recommended for new or complex experiments.\n\n<<<13>>>"
