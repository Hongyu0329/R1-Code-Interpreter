The number of iterations `k` required for the Schwarz Relaxation Method to converge up to time `T` is given by the formula:

`k = ceil((T * c / M + 1) / 2)`

Where:
*   `T` is the time instant up to which convergence is required.
*   `c` is the propagation speed of the wave.
*   `M` is the size of the overlap between the subdomains.

**Derivation:**

The Schwarz Relaxation Method described is an iterative process of a Gauss-Seidel type, where information is exchanged across the boundaries of the subdomains. The use of absorbing boundary conditions is crucial, as it ensures that errors propagate through the interfaces into the adjacent subdomain without reflecting. This allows for convergence in a finite number of iterations for a given time `T`.

Let's trace the time for which the solution is correct after each iteration. An iteration `k` is complete after both subdomains, `Ω₁` and `Ω₂`, have been updated and the iteration counter is incremented to `k`.

*   **Initial State (k=0):** The solution is only guaranteed to be correct at `t=0`.

*   **End of Iteration 1 (k=1):**
    1.  The solution in `Ω₁` is updated using boundary information from `Ω₂` at iteration 0. An error wave from the interface `x=a` takes `M/c` seconds to travel across the overlap and affect the boundary condition at `x=b`. Thus, the new solution `u₁¹` is correct for `t < M/c`.
    2.  The solution in `Ω₂` is then updated using the newly computed `u₁¹`. Since `u₁¹` is correct for `t < M/c`, the error source for `u₂¹` at interface `x=a` begins at time `t = M/c`.
    3.  The overall solution (`u₁¹`, `u₂¹`) is therefore correct for `t < M/c`. The time of convergence is `T₁ = M/c`.

*   **End of Iteration 2 (k=2):**
    1.  `Ω₁` is updated using `u₂¹`. The error source for `u₂¹` was at `(a, M/c)`. This error reaches the boundary `b` at `t = M/c + M/c = 2M/c`. The new solution `u₁²` is thus correct for `t < 2M/c`.
    2.  `Ω₂` is updated using `u₁²`. The error source for `u₂²` at `a` now begins at `t = 2M/c`.
    3.  However, the combined solution (`u₁²`, `u₂²`) is only guaranteed to be correct up to the time when the first error arrives. The error in `u₁²` starts propagating from `b` at `t=2M/c` and reaches `a` at `t=3M/c`. So `u_1^2` is correct for `t < 3M/c`. The combined solution is correct for `t < 3M/c`. The time of convergence is `T₂ = 3M/c`.

*   **Generalization:**
    Following this pattern, the time of convergence `T_k` after `k` full iterations is:
    `T_k = (2k - 1) * M / c`

To find the number of iterations `k` needed to achieve convergence up to time `T`, we set `T_k ≥ T`:
`(2k - 1) * M / c ≥ T`
`2k - 1 ≥ T * c / M`
`2k ≥ (T * c / M) + 1`
`k ≥ (T * c / M + 1) / 2`

Since `k` must be an integer, we take the ceiling of the expression on the right-hand side.

`k = ceil((T * c / M + 1) / 2)`
