    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Athos**.\n\nSeveral mountains other than Mount Olympus play a role in Homer's epic poem. The three most prominent are Mount Ida, Mount Athos, and Mount Samothrace. When comparing their heights, Mount Athos emerges as the highest peak.\n\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located in northeastern Greece, it has a height of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet). Homer mentions Mount Athos in the *Iliad*.\n*   **Mount Ida:** Situated in modern-day Turkey, near the ancient city of Troy, its highest peak, Gargarus, stands at 1,770 meters (5,820 feet). Mount Ida is frequently referenced in the *Iliad* as a place from which the gods observed the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** The highest peak of this Greek island is Mount Fengari (also called Saos), which reaches an elevation of 1,611 meters (5,285 feet). In the *Iliad*, the god Poseidon is said to have watched the Trojan War from the summit of Samothrace.\n\nBased on these elevations, Mount Athos is the tallest of the historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, second only to Mount Olympus itself, which has a height of 2,917 meters (9,570 feet).\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
