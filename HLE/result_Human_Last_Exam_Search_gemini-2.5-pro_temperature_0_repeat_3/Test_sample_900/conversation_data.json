    "It is not possible to provide a definitive number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\"\n\nThe reason for this is rooted in the unique choreographic style of William Forsythe. His work is renowned for deconstructing the traditional vocabulary of classical ballet. Forsythe takes familiar steps, alters them, pushes them to extreme angles, and reassembles them in unconventional sequences. As Forsythe himself has said about his process, \"The ballet steps were the alphabet. What I did was put them in novel arrangements, taking them out of their usual sequences.\"\n\nWhile the solo contains movements that are reminiscent of classical steps, including fast, travelling movements that share qualities with a \"pas de Balanchine,\" they are performed with a speed, angularity, and deconstruction that defy simple, traditional classification. Therefore, any attempt to count a specific, textbook ballet step like the \"pas de Balanchine\" would be a subjective interpretation rather than an accurate, factual count.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a definitive count.>>>"
