    "To determine the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure, we first need to find the extent of the curve in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n\n**Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$).\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$. So, the range for x is $[-1, 1]$.\n*   The y-values range from $\\sin(0) = 0$ to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$. So, the range for y is $$.\nThis part of the curve is the upper semi-unit circle.\n\n**Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$ (since $b=5$).\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$. So, the range for x is $[-1, 1]$.\n*   The y-values range from $5\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$. So, the range for y is $[-5, 0)$.\nThis part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n\n**Overall Dimensions of the Figure**\nTo find the full extent of the figure, we combine the ranges from both parts:\n*   **Total x-range:** The union of $[-1, 1]$ and $[-1, 1]$ is $[-1, 1]$. The width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values, which is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Total y-range:** The union of $$ and $[-5, 0)$ is $[-5, 1]$. The height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values, which is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Smallest Outcircling Square**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle with a width of 2 and a height of 6. A square that outcircles (or contains) this figure must have a side length that is at least as large as the largest dimension of the figure.\nThe dimensions of the figure are 2 and 6. The larger dimension is 6.\nTherefore, the side length of the smallest square that can outcircle the figure must be 6.\n\n**Area of the Square**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\nArea = (Side Length)² = 6² = 36.\n\n<<<36>>>To determine the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure, we first need to find the extent of the curve in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n\n**Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$ (since $b=1$).\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$.
