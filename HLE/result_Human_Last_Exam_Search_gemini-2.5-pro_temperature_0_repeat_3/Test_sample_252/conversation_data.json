    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a technique known as Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is employed. This method captures a three-dimensional data cube, with two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension, in a single snapshot.\n\nThe core of a CTIS system is a dispersive element that projects the spectral information onto a 2D detector. A single one-dimensional diffraction grating would only disperse light along one axis. This is analogous to traditional tomography with projections from only one angle, which is insufficient for reconstruction and leads to significant artifacts known as the \"missing cone problem\".\n\nTo overcome this, CTIS systems use a two-dimensional (2D) disperser. This is typically a single optical component, such as a computer-generated hologram (CGH) or two crossed gratings, that functions as two perpendicular diffraction gratings. This 2D grating creates multiple, differently dispersed projections of the scene onto the detector array in a single snapshot. For example, a common configuration creates a 3x3 or 5x5 pattern of diffraction orders. These multiple projections provide the necessary angular views of the data cube to allow for a tomographic reconstruction of the full spectral volume.\n\nWhile some early designs experimented with three gratings, this was found to be sensitive to alignment errors. The most fundamental and common approach for single-shot spectral imaging with CTIS requires projections in two different directions. This is achieved with a 2D grating, which functions as two orthogonal gratings. Therefore, the minimum number of effective gratings required is two.\n\n<<<B>>>"
