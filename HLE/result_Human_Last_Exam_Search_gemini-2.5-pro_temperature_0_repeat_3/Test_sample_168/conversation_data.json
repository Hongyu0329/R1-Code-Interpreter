    "The sound produced by a sustained human muscle contraction is a low-frequency vibration, typically around 25 Hz. To determine which animal might hear this, we must compare this frequency to the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\n*   **Human (E):** The typical human hearing range is 20 to 20,000 Hz. While 25 Hz is within this range, the sound of a muscle twitch is generally too faint for humans to perceive without amplification, although some people can hear a rumbling sound by voluntarily contracting the tensor tympani muscle in the ear.\n*   **Dog (A):** A dog's hearing range is approximately 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz. Since their low-frequency hearing does not extend down to 25 Hz, they would be unable to hear a muscle twitch.\n*   **Bat (B):** Bats are specialists in high-frequency hearing, used for echolocation, with ranges that can go up to 200,000 Hz. Their low-frequency hearing is poor; they generally cannot hear well below 1,000 Hz.\n*   **Whale (D):** Whales are divided into two groups with different hearing specializations. Toothed whales, like dolphins, use high frequencies for echolocation, while baleen whales are known for their excellent low-frequency (infrasonic) hearing, which can go as low as 7 Hz. Blue whales, for example, communicate using sounds far below the range of human hearing. Therefore, a baleen whale is a plausible candidate.\n*   **Herring (C):** Herring are known as \"hearing specialists\" among fish. They possess an exceptionally wide and sensitive hearing range. Studies show they can hear low-frequency sounds down to at least 30 Hz and can be sensitive to infrasound as low as 5 Hz. Their hearing is sensitive enough to detect the faintest sounds, which would likely include the low-frequency vibrations from muscle contractions of nearby animals.\n\nComparing the candidates, both baleen whales and herring have the low-frequency sensitivity to potentially detect a 25 Hz muscle twitch. However, herring are specifically noted for their broad and highly sensitive hearing across a wide spectrum, including the very low frequencies produced by muscle movement.\n\n<<<C>>>"
