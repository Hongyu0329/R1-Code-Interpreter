    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, denoted as $\\pi_i$, we need to solve the system of equations when the derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. The system of equations describes a continuous-time Markov chain.\n\nFirst, we must address a likely typo in the second equation. For the total probability $\\sum P_i(t)$ to be conserved (i.e., equal to 1 for all $t$), the sum of the derivatives $\\sum P_i'(t)$ must be zero. Let's check the given system:\n$P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3' = (-\\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1) + (-\\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\dots) + \\dots$\nThe terms in $P_1$ and other probabilities cancel out, but the terms in $P_0$ sum to $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0$, which is not zero. In a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the flow from state 0 to 1, which is $\\lambda_{01}P_0$, should appear with a positive sign in the equation for $P_1'$. The equation should be:\n$P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\nWith this correction, $\\sum P_i'(t) = 0$, and the system is consistent with the conservation of probability. Solving the system with the original sign leads to a contradiction.\n\nThe steady-state system of linear equations is ($P_i(+\\infty) = \\pi_i$):\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nThe equations become:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 \\pi_{0} + 0.65 \\pi_{1}$\n2.  (This equation is redundant as it is a linear combination of the others)\n3.  $0 = 0.4 \\pi_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_{2} \\implies 0.4 \\pi_{1} = 0.4 \\pi_{2} \\implies \\pi_{1} = \\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 \\pi_{2} - 0.008 \\pi_{3} \\implies \\pi_{2} = \\pi_{3}$\n\nFrom equations (3) and (4), we get $\\pi_{1} = \\pi_{2} = \\pi_{3}$.\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express $\\pi_0$ in terms of $\\pi_1$:\n$0.019 \\pi_{0} = 0.65 \\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_{1}$\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (5):\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\nSubstituting the relations we found:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}) \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}) \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$\\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\pi_{1} = 1 \\implies \\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow we can find $\\pi_0$:\n$\\pi_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1}$:\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to four decimal places, the result is 0.9463.\n\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
