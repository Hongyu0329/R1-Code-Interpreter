    "Based on an analysis of pre-flop opening ranges, the worst suited jack you should open from the button to 2.5x in a 100BB rake-free cash game is J5s.\n\nA standard button raising range in a 100bb cash game can be as wide as 40.5% to 52.64% of hands. One suggested range includes suited jacks down to J5s. Another source recommends opening with J6s and stronger suited jacks. In a rake-free environment, it is generally advisable to play a wider range of hands from the button to capitalize on the advantage of position and to steal the blinds, as there is no rake taken from pots that end pre-flop. This encourages opening with a wider range of hands than in a raked game.\n\nGiven these factors, J5s is considered the marginal end of the suited jack opening range from the button.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
