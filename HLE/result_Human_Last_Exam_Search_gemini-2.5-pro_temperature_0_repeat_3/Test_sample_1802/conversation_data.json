    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix, we first need to understand the properties of the Pauli channel and its relationship with its complementary channel.\n\n### 1. The Pauli Channel and its Rank\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is described by the following operation on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ is the set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators). These operators form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n*   $\\{p_k\\}$ is a set of probabilities, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ for all $k$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$.\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix, which is equivalent to the dimension of the vector space spanned by its Kraus operators. For the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the Kraus operators are given by $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\nSince the generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ are linearly independent, the number of linearly independent Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$ is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$. To maximize the rank of the channel, we can choose all $d^2$ probabilities to be non-zero. A prominent example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k$.\n\nIn this case, there are $d^2$ linearly independent Kraus operators. Therefore, the maximal rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n### 2. The Complementary Channel and its Rank\n\nEvery quantum channel $\\Lambda$ has a complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. This arises from the Stinespring dilation theorem, which states that any channel can be represented as a unitary evolution on a larger system, followed by tracing out an ancillary \"environment\" system. The original channel describes the evolution of the system, while the complementary channel describes the information that \"leaks\" into the environment.\n\nA fundamental result in quantum information theory is that the rank of a quantum channel is equal to the rank of its complementary channel. This can be understood by considering that the Choi matrices of the channel and its complementary channel are both reduced density matrices of the same pure quantum state on a larger tripartite system. A basic property of pure quantum states is that the ranks of their reduced density matrices are equal.\n\nTherefore, we have the equality:\n\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) $$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$, and the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is always equal to the rank of $\\Lambda$, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of $\\Lambda$ is also $d^2$.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit of dimension $d$ is $d^2$.>>>"
