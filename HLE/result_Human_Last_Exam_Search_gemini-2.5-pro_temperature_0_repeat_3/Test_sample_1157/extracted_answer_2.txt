The appropriate management for this patient involves a multi-phased approach. Initially, her uncontrolled diabetes must be addressed through medical consultation and treatment to achieve glycemic control (HbA1c < 7.0%), and she should receive tetanus prophylaxis and prophylactic antibiotics due to the traumatic nature of the injury and her diabetic status. The avulsed teeth (left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar) are not viable for replantation after a 28-hour delay, so the immediate dental treatment involves cleaning and managing the open sockets to promote healing. The cells of primary interest in her healing process are neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts, whose functions are impaired by hyperglycemia, leading to delayed healing and increased infection risk. Senescent cells may also contribute to persistent inflammation.

Once her systemic health is stabilized, the definitive treatment would be a **cast metal framework removable partial denture (RPD)**. This would be a Kennedy Class III design. The recommended material is a **biocompatible metal framework (Titanium or Cobalt-Chromium)** with **Polymethyl me
