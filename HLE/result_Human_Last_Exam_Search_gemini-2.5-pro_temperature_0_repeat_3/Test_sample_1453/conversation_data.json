    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, a systematic analysis based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing and the arrangement of amino acids in the heptad repeat is required.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a seven-residue repeat, denoted by the letters `abcdefg`. The stability and oligomeric state of the coiled-coil are primarily determined by the hydrophobic amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions, which form the core of the structure through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\nTo identify the correct reading frame of the heptad repeat for the given sequence, we analyze all seven possibilities. The most chemically plausible frame is the one that places hydrophobic residues consistently at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nBy testing each possible starting position for the heptad repeat, one frame stands out. If we assign the second residue, 'E', as position 'c', the following pattern for the 'a' and 'd' core positions emerges:\n\n*   **Position 'a'**: Consistently occupied by Leucine (L)\n*   **Position 'd'**: Consistently occupied by Isoleucine (I)\n\nLet's verify this register (`gabcdef...` starting from the first residue 'G'):\n*   **Sequence**: G E I A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G\n*   **Register**: g a b c d e **f** g a **b** c d e **f** g a **b** c d e **f** g a **b** c d e **f** g a\n\nThis is incorrect. Let's re-examine the frame starting with 'G' at position 'b' (`bcdefga...`):\n*   **a-positions**: L, L, L, L\n*   **d-positions**: I, I, I, I\n\nThis frame provides a perfect and consistent hydrophobic core with Leucine at all 'a' positions and Isoleucine at all 'd' positions.\n\n### 2. Applying Packing Rules to Determine Oligomeric State\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions is a crucial determinant of the oligomeric state. Landmark studies on the GCN4 coiled-coil established a set of rules based on the placement of Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L):\n\n*   **Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' (`a=I, d=L`)**: This arrangement favors the formation of a **dimer**.\n*   **Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' (`a=L, d=I`)**: Reversing the positions of Isoleucine and Leucine strongly favors the formation of a **tetramer**.\n*   **Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' (`a=I, d=I`)**: This combination is characteristic of **trimers**.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` reveals a consistent pattern where the 'a' positions are occupied by Leucine (L) and the 'd' positions are occupied by Isoleucine (I). Based on the established principles of coiled-coil packing, this specific arrangement directs the protein to form a four-helix bundle.\n\nTherefore, the predicted oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
