    "Here is a step-by-step analysis using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory to predict the ratio of products A and B.\n\n### 1. Identify the Reaction Type and Applicable Rules\nThe reaction is the thermal electrocyclization of a polyene, specifically \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The conjugated system involved consists of 8 π-electrons (from the four double bonds).\n\nAccording to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which are based on FMO theory, the stereochemical outcome of an electrocyclic reaction depends on the number of π-electrons and the reaction conditions (thermal or photochemical).\n\n*   **Number of π-electrons:** 8. This fits the general formula 4n, where n=2.\n*   **Condition:** The reaction is conducted under thermal conditions.\n\nFor a 4n π-electron system undergoing a thermal electrocyclization, the rules predict a **conrotatory** ring closure. This is because, in the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of an 8π system (ψ₄), the p-orbitals at the termini of the conjugated system have opposite phases. To achieve constructive (bonding) overlap to form the new σ-bond, the termini must rotate in the same direction (conrotation).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Starting Material\nThe stereochemistry of the final product depends on the spatial arrangement of the substituents on the terminal carbons of the reacting system (C2 and C9). The substituents are a methyl group (from C1) and a hydrogen on C2, and a methyl group (from C10) and a hydrogen on C9.\n\nWe need to determine whether these substituents are pointing \"inside\" or \"outside\" the U-shape of the polyene chain as it coils to react.\n\n*   Let's trace the chain's conformation based on the given Z/E configurations: \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\).\n    *   A sequence of (Z)-configured double bonds tends to form a helical or coiled structure.\n    *   At the C2 terminus, the (2Z) configuration places the methyl group (C1) and the rest of the carbon chain (starting with C4) on the same side of the C2=C3 double bond. In the reactive conformation, this typically results in the methyl group pointing **outward**.\n    *   The (4Z) and (6Z) configurations continue this coiling.\n    *   At the C9 terminus, the (8E) configuration means that the preceding chain (C7) and the methyl group (C10) are on opposite sides of the C8=C9 double bond. This geometry forces the methyl group at C9 to point **inward**.\n\nSo, the disposition of the methyl groups at the termini is **(out, in)**.\n\n### 3. Predict the Product Stereochemistry from Conrotation\nNow, we apply the predicted conrotatory motion to the (out, in) arrangement of the substituents.\n\nLet's visualize the ring closure:\n*   Imagine the U-shaped molecule lying in a plane. The \"out\" substituent points away from the center of the U, and the \"in\" substituent points towards the center. The p-orbitals are perpendicular to this plane (up and down).\n*   In a conrotatory motion, both termini rotate in the same direction (e.g., both clockwise).\n    *   The **outward** methyl group at C2 will rotate to point either \"up\" or \"down\" relative to the newly forming ring plane.\n    *   The **inward** methyl group at C9 will rotate in the same direction.\n*   Let's trace the movement:\n    *   **Clockwise conrotation:** The \"out\" group at C2 moves \"up\". The \"in\" group at C9 moves \"down\".\n    *   **Counter-clockwise conrotation:** The \"out\" group at C2 moves \"down\". The \"in\" group at C9 moves \"up\".\n\nIn both possible conrotatory paths, one methyl group ends up \"up\" and the other ends up \"down\". This corresponds to a **trans** relative stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the conrotatory cyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is predicted to yield exclusively the **trans-isomer (B)**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Predicted Ratio\nBased on the analysis above, FMO theory predicts that the symmetry-allowed conrotatory pathway leads solely to the trans-isomer B. The formation of the cis-isomer A would require a disrotatory ring closure, which is symmetry-forbidden under thermal conditions. A forbidden pathway has a much higher activation energy and is not expected to occur to any significant extent.\n\nThus, the prediction based on Frontier Molecular Orbital theory is that only the trans-isomer B will be formed.\n\nThe predicted ratio of A (cis-isomer) to B (trans-isomer) is **0:100**.\n\n<<<0:100>>>"
