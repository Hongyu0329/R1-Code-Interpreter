The value of the critical exponent ν is not a single number but depends on the spatial dimension 'd'. For d > 4, ν = 1/2. At d = 4, ν = 1/2 with logarithmic corrections. For d < 4, the value is non-trivial and depends on the specific dimension and symmetry of the system (e.g., ν ≈ 0.630 for the 3D Ising model and ν = 1 for the 2D Ising model).
