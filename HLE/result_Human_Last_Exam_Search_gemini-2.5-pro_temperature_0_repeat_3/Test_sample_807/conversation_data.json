    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride, also known as Rhodamine B, is **Shocking Pink**.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is a synthetic dye more commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is known for its bright, fluorescent pink color. While Crayola does not disclose the specific pigments used in each of their crayons, \"Shocking Pink\" is a fluorescent, or neon, color produced by the company.\n\nThere have been special edition Crayola crayons that feature the chemical names of colorants on their labels, and Rhodamine B has been associated with a pink or red crayon in these sets. However, it has been noted that these labels may be for illustrative purposes, showing a chemical that produces a similar color rather than being the actual ingredient. Given that Rhodamine B is a fluorescent pink dye, the Crayola crayon with the corresponding color and property is \"Shocking Pink\".\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
