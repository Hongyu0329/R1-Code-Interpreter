Based on the provided XRD data, it is not possible to definitively determine the chemical phase, unit cell structure, and lattice constants without specialized software and database access. The pattern is complex, with major peaks at approximately 33.0°, 36.0°, and 39.2°, and does not clearly match common reference patterns for simple oxides or nitrides. The broadness of the peaks suggests the material may be nanocrystalline or contain significant lattice strain. A full analysis using peak fitting and Rietveld refinement against a crystallographic database is required for an accurate identification.
