    "I have researched the rules of Latin hexameter scansion, including the definitions of dactyls and spondees, and the factors that determine syllable length, such as vowel quantity and position (i.e., a vowel followed by two consonants). I have also learned about elision, where a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h,\" causing the first syllable to be omitted from the scansion. The provided search results offer general rules and examples but do not contain a specific scansion of the line in question. Therefore, I need to apply these rules to the given line to determine its metrical pattern. The next steps of my original plan are still valid. I will proceed to analyze the line syllable by syllable and then group them into feet.\n\nAnalyze the line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\" for syllable length.\nGroup the syllables into six metrical feet.\nRepresent each foot as either a dactyl (D) or a spondee (S).\nFormulate the final answer in the required format.\nI am ready to proceed with the analysis and provide the final answer without further searching.\nThe scansion of the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\" is as follows:\n\nD S S D D S\n\nHere is a breakdown of the scansion foot by foot:\n\n1.  **ve-rum u-**: The \"e\" in \"verum\" is short, but the syllable is long by position because it is followed by two consonants (\"r\" and \"m\"). The \"u\" in \"verum\" is short. The \"u\" in \"ubi\" is short. This forms a dactyl (long-short-short).\n2.  **bi e-qui at-**: The \"i\" in \"ubi\" is short. The \"e\" in \"equi\" is long by nature. The \"a\" in \"atque\" is short, but the syllable is made long by position because it is followed by two consonants (\"t\" and \"qu\"). This creates a spondee (long-long).\n3.  **que ho-mi-nis**: The \"que\" is short. The \"o\" in \"hominis\" is long by nature. The \"i\" at the end of \"hominis\" is short. This forms a spondee (long-long).\n4.  **ca-su con-**: The \"a\" in \"casu\" is long by nature. The \"u\" is short. The \"o\" in \"convenit\" is short, but the syllable is long by position, followed by two consonants (\"n\" and \"v\"). This creates a dactyl (long-short-short).\n5.  **ve-nit i-**: The \"e\" in \"venit\" is short. The \"i\" is short. The \"i\" in \"imago\" is long by nature. This forms a dactyl (long-short-short).\n6.  **ma-go**: The \"a\" in \"imago\" is long by nature. The final \"o\" is treated as long, which is typical for the final syllable of a hexameter line. This creates a spondee (long-long).\n\n<<<D S S D D S>>>"
