The conditions for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are primarily established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. The main conditions are: the functions must satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition, and there must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) such that x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀).
