    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community. This is often denoted as S(k, ω) or S(q, ω), where k (or q) represents the wave vector (related to the spatial Fourier transform) and ω represents the angular frequency (related to the temporal Fourier transform).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, also known as the Van Hove correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform, the dynamic structure factor, provides information about the collective dynamics of particles in the system and is crucial for understanding neutron scattering in materials relevant to nuclear criticality.\n\nIn the context of nuclear data for criticality safety analysis, the thermal scattering law, S(α,β), is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor. This law is used in neutron transport codes like MCNP to model the thermal scattering of neutrons in moderating and structural materials. For systems with multiple types of atoms, the total scattering is a weighted sum of partial dynamic structure factors, which is where the \"generalized\" aspect becomes particularly relevant.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
