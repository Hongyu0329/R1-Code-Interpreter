    "### Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge is 1/25\n\nIn a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge during a single step of randomized uniform gossiping is 1/25, or 4%. This calculation is based on a standard node-centric gossip protocol where a node is chosen uniformly at random and then selects one of its neighbors uniformly at random for communication.\n\nA 10-node barbell graph is constructed by taking two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (Kâ‚…) and connecting them with a single edge, known as the bottleneck or bridge. Let's denote the two nodes connected by this bridge as 'u' and 'v'.\n\nThe gossiping process unfolds in two stages:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the 10 available nodes. The probability of picking any specific node is 1/10.\n2.  The selected node then uniformly chooses one of its neighbors to communicate with. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor is 1 divided by the degree of the selected node (i.e., its number of connections).\n\nIn this graph structure:\n*   The two nodes forming the bridge, 'u' and 'v', are each connected to 4 nodes within their respective 5-node cliques and to each other. Therefore, their degree is 5.\n*   The remaining 8 nodes (4 in each clique) are only connected to the other 4 nodes within their clique, so their degree is 4.\n\nThe bottleneck edge (u, v) can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n*   **Node 'u' is selected and chooses 'v':** The probability of selecting node 'u' is 1/10. Since 'u' has 5 neighbors, the probability of it choosing 'v' is 1/5. The combined probability for this event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n*   **Node 'v' is selected and chooses 'u':** Similarly, the probability of selecting node 'v' is 1/10. With 5 neighbors, the probability of it choosing 'u' is 1/5. The combined probability here is also (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events: 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nThis model of gossiping, where a node is activated randomly and then contacts a random neighbor, is a common approach in the study of distributed algorithms.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
