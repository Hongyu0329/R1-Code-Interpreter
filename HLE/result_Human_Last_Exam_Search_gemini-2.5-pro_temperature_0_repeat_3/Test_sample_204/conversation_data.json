    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, is a topological invariant that characterizes the mapping from a 3-sphere (S³) to a 2-sphere (S²). In the context of a 3D vector field in Euclidean space, the space is compactified to S³ by requiring the vector field to point in a uniform direction at infinity. The vector field itself, being a unit vector at every point, maps to the surface of a unit sphere, S².\n\nThe Whitehead integral formula provides a method to calculate the Hopf charge (H):\nH = - (1/ (4π)²) ∫ **F** ⋅ **A** dV\nwhere **F** is the emergent magnetic field derived from the vector field **n**, and **A** is the corresponding vector potential (**F** = ∇ × **A**). While this formula is fundamental, its direct computation is often complex.\n\nFor vector fields with a specific toroidal or \"hopfion\" structure, the Hopf charge can be determined by identifying two key winding numbers:\n1.  **Azimuthal (or toroidal) winding number (n):** This describes how many times the vector field wraps around the central axis of the torus as one travels around it.\n2.  **Poloidal winding number (m):** This describes how many times the vector field wraps in the direction through the \"hole\" of the torus.\n\nThe Hopf charge is then given by the product of these two integers: H = n * m.\n\nLet's analyze the given vector field:\n*   **n** = (nx, ny, nz)\n*   nx = sin(G)cos(f)\n*   ny = sin(G)sin(f)\n*   nz = cos(G)\n\nThis is a unit vector field where G represents the polar angle and f represents the azimuthal angle.\n\n1.  **Azimuthal Winding (n):** The azimuthal angle of the vector field is given by `f = atan2(y,x)`. In cylindrical coordinates, this is simply the spatial azimuthal angle φ. As one completes a full circle in the xy-plane (φ from 0 to 2π), the vector field's azimuthal angle `f` also completes one full circle. This corresponds to an azimuthal winding number **n = 1**.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding (m):** The polar angle of the vector field is `G = π * exp(-10*r2)`.\n    *   At infinity (r2 → ∞), G → 0, which means **n** points in the +z direction (nz = cos(0) = 1).\n    *   On the circle defined by `r2 = 0` (i.e., `x² + y² = 0.5` and `z = 0`), G = π, which means **n** points in the -z direction (nz = cos(π) = -1).\n    The vector field smoothly transitions from pointing up at infinity, through the horizontal plane, to pointing down on the central ring. This full sweep from one pole to the other corresponds to a poloidal winding number of **m = 1**.\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge of the given vector field is the product of these winding numbers.\n\nH = n * m = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a toroidal hopfion with a unit topological charge. The preimages of any two distinct points on the S² sphere of vector orientations form interlinked closed loops in the 3D space, and their linking number is equal to the Hopf charge.\n\n<<<1>>>"
