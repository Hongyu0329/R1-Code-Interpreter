    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single particle in a non-interacting system. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of such systems.\n\nThe bare Green's function, particularly in the context of many-body physics and quantum field theory, is typically represented in frequency-momentum space. For a system of non-interacting fermions, the Hamiltonian can be written as H₀ = Σₖ ϵₖ c†ₖ cₖ, where c†ₖ and cₖ are the creation and annihilation operators for a particle in a state with momentum k and energy ϵₖ.\n\nThe bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) in frequency (ω) and momentum (k) space is given by:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ sign(ϵₖ - μ))**\n\nHere:\n*   **ω** represents the frequency.\n*   **ϵₖ** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a given momentum k.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which sets the energy of the Fermi level. The energy is often measured relative to the chemical potential, as ξₖ = ϵₖ - μ.\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimal term in the denominator, with δ being a small positive real number. This term is crucial for defining the contour of integration in the complex frequency plane and ensures the correct time-ordering of the Green's function. The sign of this infinitesimal term depends on whether the state k is above or below the Fermi level.\n\nThis expression reveals that the bare Green's function has poles at frequencies corresponding to the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In simpler terms, the function diverges when the energy of the propagating particle (ω) matches the energy of an available single-particle state (ϵₖ). This divergence signifies a stable, non-interacting particle excitation.\n\nFor a system where the states are indexed by a general set of quantum numbers 'i' instead of momentum 'k', the bare Green's function in the energy domain is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal elements are given by:\n\n**G₀,ᵢᵢ(ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵᵢ)**\n\nThis shows a direct inverse relationship between the bare Green's function and the difference between the frequency variable and the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This fundamental relationship is derived from the path integral formulation for non-interacting particles and forms the starting point for perturbative calculations in interacting systems.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 shows an inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In frequency-momentum space, this is expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where ω is the frequency and iδ is an infinitesimal term that ensures proper time ordering. This means G_0 has poles at the single-particle energies.>>>"
