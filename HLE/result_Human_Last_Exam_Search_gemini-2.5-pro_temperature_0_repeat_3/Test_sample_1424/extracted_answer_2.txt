In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 shows an inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In frequency-momentum space, this is expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where ω is the frequency and iδ is an infinitesimal term that ensures proper time ordering. This means G_0 has poles at the single-particle energies.
