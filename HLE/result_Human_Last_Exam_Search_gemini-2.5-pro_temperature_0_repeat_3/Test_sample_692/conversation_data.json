    "The earliest known recorded date by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is a subject of ongoing archaeological discussion, with strong evidence pointing to the Zapotec civilization, and a potential earlier date from the Olmec civilization.\n\nThe most widely accepted and securely documented earliest recorded date is **\"1 Earthquake,\"** found on Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. This monument, a carved stone depicting a sacrificed captive, features two glyphs between the figure's feet that are interpreted as his calendrical name based on the 260-day ritual calendar. The monument is dated to the Late Rosario phase, around **600 to 500 BCE**. This inscription is considered the first documented use of the 260-day calendar.\n\nA potential, and possibly earlier, recorded date comes from the Olmec civilization. At the site of San Andrés in Tabasco, Mexico, a ceramic cylinder seal was discovered and dated to approximately **650 BCE**. The inscription on this seal has been interpreted by some archaeologists as representing the day **\"3 Ajaw\"** from the 260-day calendar. If this interpretation is correct, it would predate the Zapotec inscription. However, there is scholarly debate as to whether the glyphs represent a definitive calendrical date or are iconographic symbols.\n\nAnother significant early writing system, the Cascajal Block, also from the Olmecs and dating to around 900 BCE, is considered the oldest writing in the Americas, but its inscriptions are not believed to contain a calendrical date.\n\nLater than both the Zapotec and potential Olmec examples is the earliest known recorded date from the Maya civilization. Mural fragments from San Bartolo, Guatemala, show the date **\"7 Deer,\"** which has been radiocarbon-dated to between **300 and 200 BCE**.\n\nIn summary, while the Olmec \"3 Ajaw\" is a candidate for the earliest recorded date, the Zapotec \"1 Earthquake\" from San José Mogote is the most frequently cited and securely interpreted earliest calendrical date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n<<<\"1 Earthquake\" (Zapotec, c. 600-500 BCE)>>>"
