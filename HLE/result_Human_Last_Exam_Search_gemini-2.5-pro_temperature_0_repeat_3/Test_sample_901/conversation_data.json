    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this product is formed:\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction Type**: The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide. Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base, and tert-butyl alcohol is the solvent. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry Requirement for E2**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The hydrogen atom to be removed and the leaving group (bromine) must be in an *anti-periplanar* arrangement. In a cyclohexane ring, this means both groups must be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one pointing up, the other down).\n\n3.  **Chair Conformation Analysis**:\n    *   The (1S,2R) configuration indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *trans* to each other (on opposite sides of the ring).\n    *   We must consider the two possible chair conformations of this molecule:\n        *   **Conformation A**: Bromine is axial (a), and the methyl group is equatorial (e).\n        *   **Conformation B**: Bromine is equatorial (e), and the methyl group is axial (a).\n    *   Conformation A is more stable because the larger methyl group occupies the less sterically hindered equatorial position.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Removable Proton**:\n    *   For the E2 reaction to occur, the bromine atom must be in an axial position. Therefore, the reaction proceeds through the more stable Conformation A.\n    *   In Conformation A, with the bromine being axial, we look for anti-periplanar protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n        *   **At C2**: The methyl group is equatorial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is axial. However, this axial hydrogen is on the same side of the ring (*syn*) as the axial bromine. It is not anti-periplanar, so elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 (1-methylcyclohexene) cannot occur from this conformation.\n        *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n    *   Because only the axial hydrogen on C6 meets the geometric requirement, the base will remove this proton, and the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n\n5.  **Product Formation (Regioselectivity)**:\n    *   Elimination of HBr across C1 and C6 results in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n    *   The alternative product, 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product), would be more substituted and typically more stable. However, due to the strict anti-periplanar requirement of the E2 mechanism in the cyclohexane ring, it cannot be formed from this specific stereoisomer.\n    *   The use of a bulky base like potassium tert-butoxide generally favors the formation of the less substituted alkene (the Hofmann product), which in this case is 3-methylcyclohexene. In this specific problem, both the stereochemistry of the starting material and the nature of the base lead to the same product.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemical constraints of the E2 reaction dictate that the only possible product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
