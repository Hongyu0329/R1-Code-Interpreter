    "When two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the junction, interpreted as the number of chiral edge states at the interface, is 0.\n\nA key concept in the study of topological insulators is the bulk-boundary correspondence. This principle dictates that the number of conducting edge states at the boundary between two regions with different topological invariants is determined by the difference in those invariants. For Chern insulators, the topological invariant is the Chern number (C).\n\nSpecifically, at the interface between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers C1 and C2, the number of chiral (one-way) conducting edge states is given by the absolute difference |C1 - C2|. In this case, both insulators have a Chern number of 1 (C1 = 1 and C2 = 1).\n\nTherefore, the number of conducting states at the junction is:\n|1 - 1| = 0\n\nThis means that no special conducting channels are formed at the interface between the two identical Chern insulators. The conducting edge states will only exist on the outer boundaries of the combined system. While the junction itself does not have a Chern number in the same way the bulk material does, the number of interface states is its defining topological characteristic. One experimental study described a similar situation where two domains have the same Chern number as a case where \"no junction is expected\" in a topological sense.\n\n<<<0>>>"
