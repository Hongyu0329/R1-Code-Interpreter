    "Andrei Voznesensky immortalized the story of Nikolai Rezanov in the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" for which he wrote the libretto. Rezanov was a Russian nobleman and explorer who promoted the colonization of Alaska and California.\n\nThe question from the poem, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" alludes to the fact that Rezanov's burial site was lost for a significant period. He died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning from his travels. His original tomb was destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the 1930s. The immense popularity of the rock opera in the 1980s renewed interest in his story, leading to the rediscovery and memorialization of his presumed final resting place. In 2000, a memorial with a white cross was dedicated at his grave in the Trinity churchyard of Krasnoyarsk.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
