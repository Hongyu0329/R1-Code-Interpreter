    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to understand the relationship between the rational index \\( r = p/q \\) and the generalized Markov number \\( m_r \\).\n\nIn the theory of classical and generalized Markov numbers, the numbers are indexed by rational numbers \\( r \\in \\) through their continued fraction expansion. The structure of the continued fraction of \\( r \\) determines the corresponding Markov number. Therefore, the \"continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\)\" is the continued fraction of the index \\( 4/7 \\) itself.\n\nWe compute the regular continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\).\nThe algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a rational number \\( x \\) is as follows:\n1. Let \\( a_0 = \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\).\n2. Let \\( x_1 = 1/(x - a_0) \\).\n3. Let \\( a_1 = \\lfloor x_1 \\rfloor \\).\n4. Repeat the process until the fractional part is zero.\n\nFor \\( x = 4/7 \\):\n*   \\( a_0 = \\lfloor 4/7 \\rfloor = 0 \\)\n*   \\( x_1 = 1 / (4/7 - 0) = 7/4 \\)\n*   \\( a_1 = \\lfloor 7/4 \\rfloor = 1 \\)\n*   \\( x_2 = 1 / (7/4 - 1) = 1 / (3/4) = 4/3 \\)\n*   \\( a_2 = \\lfloor 4/3 \\rfloor = 1 \\)\n*   \\( x_3 = 1 / (4/3 - 1) = 1 / (1/3) = 3 \\)\n*   \\( a_3 = \\lfloor 3 \\rfloor = 3 \\)\n*   The remainder is 0, so the process stops.\n\nThe sequence of coefficients is \\( [a_0; a_1, a_2, a_3] \\).\nThus, the continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n\nWe can verify this:\n\\( [0; 1, 1, 3] = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = 4/7 \\).\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the continued fraction of the index \\( 4/7 \\).\n\n<<<[0; 1, 1, 3]>>>"
