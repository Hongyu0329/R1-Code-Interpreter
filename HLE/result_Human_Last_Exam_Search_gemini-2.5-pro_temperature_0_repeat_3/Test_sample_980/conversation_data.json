    "The provided sequence of numbers is: 111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124.\n\nA search for this specific sequence does not yield any direct matches, suggesting it is not a well-known standard sequence. However, analysis of the numbers within the sequence reveals a strong connection to the Collatz conjecture. The Collatz conjecture proposes a sequence that starts with any positive integer 'n'. The next term is obtained by applying one of two rules: if the current term is even, the next term is half of the current term; if the current term is odd, the next term is three times the current term plus one.\n\nSeveral numbers in the provided sequence, such as 142, 41, 62, 155, and 124, are found within the Collatz sequence that starts with the number 27. For instance, a segment of the Collatz sequence starting from 27 is 27, 82, 41, 124, 62, 31, 94, 47, 142, 71, and so on. The presence of these specific numbers strongly suggests that the underlying logic of the puzzle is related to the Collatz conjecture.\n\nThe last number in the given sequence is 124. Since 124 is an even number, applying the Collatz rule for even numbers (n/2) gives the next term in the sequence.\n\n124 / 2 = 62\n\nThe number 62 also appears multiple times within the provided sequence, which reinforces the likelihood of it being the next term.\n\nTherefore, based on the relationship of the sequence to the Collatz conjecture, the next number is 62.\n\n<<<62>>>"
