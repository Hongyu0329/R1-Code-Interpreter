    "When following the cellular automaton Rule 110 starting from a single cell in state 1, the binary pattern obtained after 20 applications of the rule is `11111001101110000011000100000000000000000`.\n\nCellular automaton Rule 110 is a one-dimensional system where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors. The evolution of the pattern from a single '1' can be tracked through successive generations.\n\nThe state of the automaton at each generation can be represented by a decimal number, which is the integer value of the binary pattern of that generation. The sequence of these decimal numbers for Rule 110 starting with a single '1' is cataloged in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A117999.\n\nThe initial state is generation 0. Applying the rule 20 times brings the automaton to generation 20. According to the OEIS sequence A117999, the decimal value for the 20th generation is 2,137,705,676,800.\n\nConverting this decimal number to its binary representation yields the pattern for the 20th generation.\n\n<<<11111001101110000011000100000000000000000>>>"
