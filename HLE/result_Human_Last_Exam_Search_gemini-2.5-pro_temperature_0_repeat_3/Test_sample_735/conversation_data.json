    "There are 30 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* = *b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (or \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by Chimere S. Anabanti and Sarah B. Hart. They proved that any finite group containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of at most 24. Their work provides a complete list of these groups.\n\nThe 30 distinct finite groups are:\n*   **Cyclic groups:** C_7, C_9, C_10, C_11, C_12, C_13, C_14, C_15, C_16, C_18, C_20, C_21, C_22, C_24\n*   **Abelian but not cyclic groups:** C_3 x C_3, C_2 x C_8, C_4 x C_4, C_2 x C_12\n*   **Dihedral groups:** D_12, D_14, D_18, D_20, D_22, D_24\n*   **Alternating and Symmetric groups:** A_4, S_4\n*   **Other non-abelian groups:** (C_4 x C_2) â‹Š C_2 (SmallGroup(16,8)), S_3 x C_3, A_4 x C_2, SL(2,3)\n\nThis comprehensive list is derived from the table published in the work of Anabanti and Hart.\n\n<<<30>>>"
