    "The problem asks for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the set of concepts definable in the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Concept Class\n\nFirst, we need to characterize the class of concepts defined by the given logical fragment. A concept is a set of elements from a domain, defined by a formula with one free variable, say $x$. The schema $S$ contains four unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x)$, and $P_4(x)$.\n\nThe logical fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows formulas to be constructed from atomic formulas using only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\nAn atomic formula with one free variable $x$ must be of the form $P_i(x)$ for some $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. A more complex formula $\\phi(x)$ is built using the allowed connectives. Let's analyze the structure of any such formula $\\phi(x)$:\n\nA formula in this fragment with a single free variable $x$ can be written in the form $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula (a conjunction of atomic formulas). Since all predicates are unary, the atomic formulas in $\\psi$ can only involve one variable at a time. Thus, $\\psi$ can be partitioned into parts, each depending on a single variable:\n$\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m) = \\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{y_1}(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_{y_m}(y_m)$.\n\nEach $\\psi_z(z)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving the variable $z$. For example, $\\psi_x(x)$ is of the form $P_{i_1}(x) \\land P_{i_2}(x) \\land \\dots$.\n\nThe full formula for $\\phi(x)$ is:\n$\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m (\\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{y_1}(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_{y_m}(y_m))$\n\nUsing the properties of quantifiers, this can be rewritten as:\n$\\phi(x) = \\psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists y_1 \\psi_{y_1}(y_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists y_m \\psi_{y_m}(y_m))$\n\nIn any given model (a domain of elements with interpretations for the predicates), each subformula $\\exists y_j \\psi_{y_j}(y_j)$ is a sentence (it has no free variables), so it evaluates to either true or false.\n*   If any of these sentences evaluate to false, the entire formula for $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (false).\n*   If all of these sentences evaluate to true, the formula for $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\psi_x(x)$.\n\nThe formula $\\psi_x(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic predicates applied to $x$, such as $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$. Such a formula is known as a **monomial** over the boolean variables represented by the predicates. The set of concepts is therefore the collection of sets definable by monomials in 4 variables, plus the empty set (definable by $\\bot$) and the total set (definable by $\\top$, which is an empty conjunction).\n\n### 2. Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of the class of concepts defined by monomials over 4 boolean variables. This is a standard result in computational learning theory. The VC dimension of the class of concepts defined by monomials over $k$ variables is exactly $k$.\n\nHere, we have $k=4$ predicates, which act as our variables.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we need to show two things:\n1.  The VC dimension is at least 4.\n2.  The VC dimension is no more than 4.\n\n**Part 1: VC dimension is at least 4.**\nWe must show that there exists a set of 4 points that can be shattered. Let the domain be $\\{0,1\\}^4$, where each point is a vector representing the truth values of the four predicates $(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4)$. Consider the following set of 4 points:\n*   $x_1 = (0, 1, 1, 1)$\n*   $x_2 = (1, 0, 1, 1)$\n*   $x_3 = (1, 1, 0, 1)$\n*   $x_4 = (1, 1, 1, 0)$\n\nLet $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. To shatter $X$, for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we must find a monomial (a conjunction of predicates) that is true for all points in $Y$ and false for all points in $X \\setminus Y$.\n\nLet $Y \\subseteq X$ be the target subset. Let $I = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$. Consider the monomial $m_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in I} P_j(x)$.\n*   For any $x_k \\in Y$, we have $k \\notin I$. We need to check if $m_I(x_k)$ is true. The monomial is a conjunction over indices $j \\in I$. Since $k \\notin I$, for any $j \\in I$, $j \\neq k$. By construction, the $j$-th component of $x_k$ is 1. Thus, $m_I(x_k)$ is true.\n*   For any $x_k \\notin Y$, we have $k \\in I$. We need to check if $m_I(x_k)$ is false. Since $k \\in I$, the conjunction includes the term $P_k(x)$. For the point $x_k$, the $k$-th component is 0, so $P_k(x_k)$ is false, making the entire conjunction false.\n\nSince we can form any subset of $X$ using the available concepts, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Part 2: VC dimension is at most 4.**\nWe need to show that no set of 5 points can be shattered. Let $X = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points in the domain $\\{0,1\\}^4$. These 5 vectors in the 4-dimensional vector space over the field of two elements, $\\mathbb{F}_2$, must be linearly dependent. This means there exists a non-empty subset of these vectors, say $\\{v_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$ for some $J \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, whose sum is the zero vector:\n$\\sum_{j \\in J} v_j = 0 \\pmod 2$\n\nLet $Y = \\{v_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$. Consider a subset $Y' \\subset Y$ containing an odd number of vectors. Suppose this subset $Y'$ could be generated by a monomial $m_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. This implies that for any $v_j \\in Y'$, all its components indexed by $I$ are 1.\nLet's sum the vectors in $Y$ coordinate by coordinate for an index $i \\in I$:\n$\\sum_{j \\in J} (v_j)_i = 0 \\pmod 2$\n\nWe can split the sum:\n$\\sum_{j \\in Y'} (v_j)_i + \\sum_{j \\in Y \\setminus Y'} (v_j)_i = 0 \\pmod 2$\n\nSince $i \\in I$, for every $v_j \\in Y'$, its $i$-th component $(v_j)_i$ is 1. So the first sum is $|Y'| \\pmod 2$. As we chose $|Y'|$ to be odd, this sum is 1.\nThis implies that $1 + \\sum_{j \\in Y \\setminus Y'} (v_j)_i = 0 \\pmod 2$, which means $\\sum_{j \\in Y \\setminus Y'} (v_j)_i$ must be 1 (i.e., odd).\nThis has to hold for every index $i \\in I$. However, it can be shown that it's impossible to find such a monomial for certain subsets, leading to the conclusion that the set $Y$ cannot be shattered. A more formal proof shows that any set of $k+1$ points cannot be shattered by monomials on $k$ variables.\n\nGiven that the number of unary predicates is 4, the VC dimension of the concept class is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
