Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to have a more favorable cytokine release profile compared to those manufactured without it (or with IL-2). This profile is characterized by a potentially lower release of cytokines associated with severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), coupled with a robust and sustained capacity to release key effector cytokines, such as IFN-Î³ and IL-2, upon antigen recognition. This is because IL-15 promotes a less differentiated, more persistent memory T cell phenotype that is highly effective without being as prone to rapid exhaustion and uncontrolled, systemic inflammation.
