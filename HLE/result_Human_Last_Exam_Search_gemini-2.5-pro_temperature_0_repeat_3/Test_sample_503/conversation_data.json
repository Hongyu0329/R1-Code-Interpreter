    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint) that form a Galois connection. This means that for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the following equivalence holds:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\n\nThis condition is equivalent to requiring that the map $L$ preserves all suprema (joins) and the map $R$ preserves all infima (meets). The objects of the simplex category, $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, are complete lattices, so all suprema and infima exist.\n\nFor an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to preserve all suprema, it must, in particular, preserve the supremum of the empty set. The supremum of the empty set in $[m]$ is its least element, 0. Therefore, $L$ must map the least element of $[m]$ to the least element of $[n]$. This means $L(0) = 0$. Any order-preserving map that satisfies this condition will preserve all other suprema automatically, since suprema of non-empty sets in a finite total order are simply maxima, which are preserved by any order-preserving map.\n\nSimilarly, for a map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ to preserve all infima, it must preserve the infimum of the empty set, which is the greatest element. This means $R(n) = m$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Thus, the number of adjunctions from $$ to $$ is the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\nWe are looking for the number of sequences $(L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23))$ such that:\n1.  $L(0) = 0$\n2.  $0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$\n\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, namely $(L(1), \\dots, L(23))$, with values taken from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars.\n\nThe problem is equivalent to choosing 23 items (the values of $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from a set of $37+1=38$ possible values, with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter as the sequence is sorted non-decreasingly. This is a multiset problem. The number of multisets of size $k$ from a set of size $n$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} $$\nIn our case, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose) and $n=38$ (the number of possible values, from 0 to 37). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$$ \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nThis number represents the total count of such order-preserving maps, and therefore the total number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$.\n\n<<<The number of internal adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{60}{23}$.>>>"
