    "A self-avoiding walk on a lattice is a path that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice, which is equivalent to a Manhattan lattice for this problem, is denoted by a(n). This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nThe initial terms of the sequence a(n) are:\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
