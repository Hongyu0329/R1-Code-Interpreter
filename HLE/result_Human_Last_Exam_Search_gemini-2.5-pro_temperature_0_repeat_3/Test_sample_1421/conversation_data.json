    "<<<In quantum statistical mechanics, the partition function Z for a system in thermal equilibrium at a temperature T is given by the trace of the Boltzmann operator, Z = Tr(e⁻ᵇᴴ), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system and β = 1/(kᵦT) with kᵦ being the Boltzmann constant. Feynman's path integral formalism provides a way to represent this partition function as an integral over all possible histories of the system's fields in imaginary time.\n\nFor a system of fermions, the fields are described by anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. The path integral is then a functional integral over these Grassmann-valued fields. A crucial feature for fermions is that the fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction.\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation is:\n\n**Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ e⁻ˢᴱ[ψ̄,ψ]**\n\nwhere:\n\n*   **∫ Dψ̄ Dψ** represents the functional integral over all possible configurations of the Grassmann-valued fermionic fields ψ(τ, **x**) and its conjugate ψ̄(τ, **x**). Here, τ is the imaginary time variable, which runs from 0 to β, and **x** represents the spatial coordinates.\n\n*   **Anti-periodic boundary conditions** are imposed on the fields in the imaginary time direction. This means the integral is restricted to paths that satisfy:\n    ψ(τ + β, **x**) = -ψ(τ, **x**)\n    ψ̄(τ + β, **x**) = -ψ̄(τ, **x**)\n\n*   **Sₑ[ψ̄, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system. It is obtained from the standard action in Minkowski spacetime by a Wick rotation to imaginary time (t → -iτ). The general form of the Euclidean action is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density Lₑ over imaginary time and space:\n    **Sₑ[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ᵇ dτ ∫ dᵈx Lₑ(ψ̄, ψ, ∂τψ, ∇ψ)**\n\nFor a common system of non-relativistic fermions with a single-particle Hamiltonian operator H₀, the Euclidean action is often written as:\n**Sₑ[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ᵇ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̄(τ, **x**)(∂τ + H₀)ψ(τ, **x**)**\n\nFor example, for free fermions, H₀ = - (∇²/2m) - μ, where m is the mass of the fermion and μ is the chemical potential.\n\nThe anti-periodic boundary condition for fermions, in contrast to the periodic boundary conditions for bosons, is a fundamental result that stems from the anti-commutation relations of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. When expressed in Fourier space, these boundary conditions lead to the discrete Matsubara frequencies for fermions being νₙ = (2n+1)π/β, where n is an integer. The path integral can then be evaluated as a product over these frequencies. For a system with a bilinear action, the integral results in the determinant of the operator (∂τ + H₀).>>>"
