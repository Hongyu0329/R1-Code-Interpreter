The flags of Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.

The flag of Denmark, with its white cross on a red field, can be represented as a matrix with two distinct types of row vectors: those representing the white horizontal stripe of the cross and those representing the red field portions (which also include the vertical part of the cross). Assuming the values for red and white are chosen to maximize the rank, these two vector types are linearly independent, giving the matrix a rank of 2.

To find African flags with the same rank, we must identify those whose designs, when viewed as a matrix, are spanned by exactly two linearly independent row or column vectors. This analysis assumes that each distinct color or emblem element contributes to the rank, in line with the principle of maximal rank.

The following African flags meet this criterion:
*   **Nigeria**: The flag is a vertical tricolor with green, white, and green bands. When represented as a matrix, there are only two unique column vectors: a green vector and a white vector. These are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.
*   **Benin**: The flag features a vertical green band at the hoist with two horizontal bands of yellow and red. This design results in two unique types of row vectors: one corresponding to the upper yellow band (preceded by green) and one for the lower red band (preceded by green). These two row vectors are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.
*   **Madagascar**: The design is structurally similar to that of Benin, with a vertical white band at the hoist and horizontal red and green bands. This also produces two distinct and linearly independent row vectors, giving the flag a rank of 2.

Other flags with more complex designs, such as those with additional stripes of different colors, central emblems, stars, or triangular elements, result in a higher number of unique row or column vectors, and therefore have a rank greater than 2.
