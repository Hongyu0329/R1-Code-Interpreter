    "The analysis seems solid. The rank of the Danish flag is 2. The condition \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal\" means that distinct, non-zero, and non-linearly-dependent values should be assigned to different colors, and all features like emblems and fimbriations must be considered as they introduce new patterns that increase the rank.\n\nMy search and analysis identified three candidates:\n1.  **Nigeria:** A vertical triband of green, white, and green. This design has two unique column vectors, leading to a rank of 2.\n2.  **Benin:** A design with a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (yellow and red) at the fly. This design has two unique row vectors, leading to a rank of 2.\n3.  **Madagascar:** A design with a vertical white band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (red and green) at the fly. This is structurally identical to Benin's flag and also has two unique row vectors, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\nOther flags were correctly eliminated because they either have more than two simple color bands (e.g., Gabon, Sierra Leone), which leads to a rank of 3 or more, or they contain additional elements like stars, emblems, triangles, or complex patterns that break the simple structure and increase the number of linearly independent rows/columns, thus increasing the rank beyond 2.\n\nThe search results confirm the designs of these flags and do not introduce any other plausible candidates. A text on linear algebra mentions that flags with horizontal or vertical stripes have a finite rank, and specifically names Nigeria and Madagascar. It assigns rank 1 to simple tricolors like \"Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chad, Colombia, Ireland, Madagascar, Mali, Netherlands, Nigeria, Romania, Russia\", which seems to be a misunderstanding of the concept. If the three stripes have different colors (like Mali), there are three distinct row/column vectors, and the rank is 3. If the pattern is A-B-A (like Nigeria), there are two distinct vectors, and the rank is 2. The author seems to consider any striped flag as `column_vector * [c1, c2, c3]`, which is incorrect. My analysis of rank is more robust.\n\nTherefore, the final list of countries is Nigeria, Benin, and Madagascar.\n\n<<<The flags of Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\nThe flag of Denmark, with its white cross on a red field, can be represented as a matrix with two distinct types of row vectors: those representing the white horizontal stripe of the cross and those representing the red field portions (which also include the vertical part of the cross). Assuming the values for red and white are chosen to maximize the rank, these two vector types are linearly independent, giving the matrix a rank of 2.\n\nTo find African flags with the same rank, we must identify those whose designs, when viewed as a matrix, are spanned by exactly two linearly independent row or column vectors. This analysis assumes that each distinct color or emblem element contributes to the rank, in line with the principle of maximal rank.\n\nThe following African flags meet this criterion:\n*   **Nigeria**: The flag is a vertical tricolor with green, white, and green bands. When represented as a matrix, there are only two unique column vectors: a green vector and a white vector. These are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\n*   **Benin**: The flag features a vertical green band at the hoist with two horizontal bands of yellow and red. This design results in two unique types of row vectors: one corresponding to the upper yellow band (preceded by green) and one for the lower red band (preceded by green). These two row vectors are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Madagascar**: The design is structurally similar to that of Benin, with a vertical white band at the hoist and horizontal red and green bands. This also produces two distinct and linearly independent row vectors, giving the flag a rank of 2.\n\nOther flags with more complex designs, such as those with additional stripes of different colors, central emblems, stars, or triangular elements, result in a higher number of unique row or column vectors, and therefore have a rank greater than 2."
