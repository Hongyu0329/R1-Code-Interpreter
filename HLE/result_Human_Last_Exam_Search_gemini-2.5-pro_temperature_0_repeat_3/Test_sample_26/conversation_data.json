    "The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 0.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n1.  **Topological Properties of X**: Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. $X$ is a complex surface, which corresponds to a real 4-dimensional manifold.\n\n2.  **Fundamental Group**: According to the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k < 2$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected (i.e., $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$), it follows that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. Thus, $X$ is a simply connected 4-manifold.\n\n3.  **Homology Groups**: As $X$ is a 4-manifold, PoincarÃ© duality holds, which implies that $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. By the universal coefficient theorem, $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Hom}(H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$, since the torsion part is zero. Because $X$ is simply connected, its first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial. Consequently, $H^1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, and therefore $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Whitehead's Exact Sequence**: For any simply connected 4-manifold like $X$, there is a portion of an exact sequence due to J.H.C. Whitehead that relates homotopy and homology groups:\n    $$H_2(X) \\otimes H_2(X) \\xrightarrow{\\cap} \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X) \\to 0$$\n    The map $\\cap$ is defined by the intersection form on the second homology group.\n\n5.  **Applying the Sequence**: Since we have established that $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, the sequence simplifies to:\n    $$H_2(X) \\otimes H_2(X) \\xrightarrow{\\cap} \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0$$\n    This exactness implies that $\\pi_3(X)$ is the cokernel of the intersection map, i.e., $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} / \\text{Im}(\\cap)$.\n\n6.  **Intersection Form**: The image of the intersection map is the subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}$ generated by the intersection numbers of all pairs of 2-cycles on $X$. For a smooth hypersurface of odd degree in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the intersection form on $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is known to be unimodular.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The degree of the hypersurface $X$ is 5, which is an odd number. Therefore, its intersection form is unimodular. A unimodular form over the integers is surjective onto $\\mathbb{Z}$. This means the image of the intersection map, $\\text{Im}(\\cap)$, is all of $\\mathbb{Z}$. Substituting this into our result from step 5, we get:\n    $$\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} / \\mathbb{Z} = 0$$\n    The third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is the trivial group. The rank of a trivial group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
