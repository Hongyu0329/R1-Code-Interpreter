    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the quantity `1 - incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy, assuming a simple, idealized model without confounding factors.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine Model:** In this model, a vaccine renders a certain percentage of recipients completely immune to the disease, while the rest remain fully susceptible. For example, a vaccine with 90% efficacy would mean 90% of vaccinated individuals are perfectly protected, and 10% have no protection at all.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate (new cases per person-time at risk) in the vaccinated group to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. Vaccine Efficacy (VE) is commonly calculated as VE = 1 - IRR.\n*   **Per-Exposure Efficacy:** This measures the reduction in risk for each exposure to the pathogen. For an all-or-nothing vaccine, an individual's per-exposure efficacy is either 100% (if they are protected) or 0% (if they are not). Therefore, the *average* per-exposure efficacy across the entire vaccinated population is equal to the proportion of people who are fully protected.\n*   **The Calculation:**\n    *   Let's say the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group is `I_u`.\n    *   In an all-or-nothing vaccine with efficacy `p` (meaning a proportion `p` of people are fully protected), the protected individuals have an incidence rate of 0. The unprotected individuals (a proportion of `1-p`) still have an incidence rate of `I_u`.\n    *   The overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`I_v`) is the weighted average: `I_v = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * I_u) = (1-p) * I_u`.\n    *   The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) is `I_v / I_u = ((1-p) * I_u) / I_u = 1-p`.\n    *   Therefore, the calculated vaccine efficacy is `1 - IRR = 1 - (1-p) = p`.\n\nSince `1 - IRR` equals `p`, and the average per-exposure efficacy for the population is also `p`, the `1 - IRR` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy. It is important to note that from incidence data alone, it is often impossible to distinguish between an all-or-nothing vaccine and a \"leaky\" vaccine (where every vaccinated person has a partial reduction in risk). Both models can produce the same `1 - IRR` value under ideal conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
