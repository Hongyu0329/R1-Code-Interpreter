    "The Grigorchuk group has 21 subgroups of index 4. This has been determined by computational analysis of the group's structure.\n\nA detailed study of the low-index subgroups of the Grigorchuk group was conducted by René Hartung in his paper \"Coset enumeration for certain infinitely presented groups\". In this paper, the author computes the number of subgroups for various small indices. For index 4, the paper reports a total of 21 subgroups. Of these 21 subgroups, 7 are normal subgroups.\n\nThe number of subgroups of a given index *n* in a group *G* is related to the number of distinct transitive actions of *G* on a set of *n* elements. This, in turn, is equivalent to counting the number of conjugacy classes of subgroups of index *n*. For the Grigorchuk group, which is a 2-group (meaning all its elements have an order that is a power of 2), any homomorphism to the symmetric group S₄ must have an image that is a 2-group. The transitive 2-subgroups of S₄ are the cyclic group of order 4 (C₄), the Klein four-group (V₄), and the dihedral group of order 8 (D₄). The calculation of the number of subgroups of index 4 therefore involves determining the number of distinct ways the Grigorchuk group can act transitively on 4 elements, with the image of these actions being one of these 2-groups.\n\n<<<21>>>"
