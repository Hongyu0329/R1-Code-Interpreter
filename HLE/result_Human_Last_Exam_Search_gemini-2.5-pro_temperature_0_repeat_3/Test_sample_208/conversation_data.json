    "The initial search has confirmed that the problem of packing equal circles into a larger circle is a well-studied area of mathematics. I found that for 14 circles, the optimal packing arrangement is known and proven. However, the search results did not directly provide the ratio of the radii for the case of 14 circles. I need to find a reliable source that either states this ratio or provides the coordinates of the centers of the 14 circles, from which I can calculate the radius of the enclosing circle.The search results from the second step confirmed that the problem of packing 14 circles has a proven optimal solution. Specifically, one result mentions a website, packomania.com, which is a comprehensive resource for circle packing problems. Another result from a research paper provides a table with data for various numbers of circles, including the ratio of the container circle's radius to the small circles' radius. I will now access this information to find the precise ratio for 14 circles. I will then use this ratio to calculate the radius of the large circle given the small circles have a radius of one. Finally, I will provide the answer to four significant digits.\n\nThe radius of the large circle is R and the radius of the small circles is r. For N=14, the ratio R/r is given as 1 + 1/sin(Ï€/10) from one source, which seems to be a specific configuration, not necessarily the optimal one for 14 circles. A more reliable source is a table from a research paper which should provide the value for the densest packing.\n\nFrom the \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" page, for N=14, the ratio of the large circle's radius to the small circle's radius is not directly listed in the snippet. However, it provides a link to download all coordinates.\n\nLet's look at the other snippets again. The Wikipedia article on \"Circle packing in a circle\" has a table of solutions, but the snippet only goes up to n=9.\n\nThe research paper \"Dense packings of congruent circles in a circle\" mentions that for n=14, the packing was improved by Goldberg. It also has a table, but the snippet doesn't show the entry for n=14.\n\nThe \"packomania\" website is mentioned as a topical website. I will search for the specific data for 14 circles on this website.The search results from step 3, specifically from \"packomania.com\" and a related PDF, provide the necessary information. One of the PDF snippets from \"packomania.com\" gives the following data for 14 circles in a circle: `radius = 0.329226992036` and `ratio = 11.364977590778`. Another PDF from the same source gives `radius = 0.598736595718` and `ratio = 1.670183528370`. The term \"radius\" in this context refers to the radius of the small circles when the large circle has a radius of 1. The \"ratio\" is the radius of the large circle when the small circles have a radius of 1. There seem to be two different packing arrangements presented. The problem asks for the radius of the circle when fourteen circles of radius one are *tightly packed*. This implies finding the minimal radius of the enclosing circle, which corresponds to the densest packing.\n\nTo determine which of the two ratios corresponds to the tightest packing, we can consider the density. A higher density means a tighter packing. The first result with `ratio = 11.36...` has a density of `0.8129...`, while the second one with `ratio = 1.67...` has a density of `0.8498...`. A higher density implies that the small circles occupy a larger proportion of the large circle's area, which means the large circle is smaller for the same number and size of small circles. Therefore, the arrangement with the higher density and smaller ratio is the one we need.\n\nThe ratio for the densest packing of 14 circles is given as approximately 1.670183528370. Since the small circles have a radius of one, the radius of the large circle is simply this ratio multiplied by 1. I need to provide the answer up to 4 significant digits.\n\nRadius of the large circle = 1.670183528370 * 1 = 1.670183528370.\n\nRounding to 4 significant digits gives 1.670.\n\nI have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\nWhen fourteen circles of radius one are tightly packed into a larger circle, the radius of this larger circle is approximately 1.670. This value is derived from the optimal packing arrangement for 14 equal circles.\n\nThe problem of packing a given number of equal circles into a larger circle is a classic problem in geometry. For 14 circles, the densest known packing arrangement results in a specific ratio between the radius of the large containing circle (R) and the radius of the smaller circles (r). This ratio (R/r) has been determined through computational studies to be approximately 1.6701835.\n\nGiven that the radius of the small circles is one, the radius of the large circle is calculated by multiplying this ratio by the radius of the small circles:\n\nRadius of large circle = 1.6701835 * 1 = 1.6701835\n\nRounding this value to four significant digits gives 1.670. This configuration has a packing density of approximately 0.8499, which represents the fraction of the area of the large circle covered by the smaller circles.\n\n<<<1.670>>>"
