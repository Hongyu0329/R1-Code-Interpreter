  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school.

To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia.

    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve Xenia's problem, followed by an analysis of its memory usage.\n\nThe most effective strategy to minimize memory usage is to process the input string character by character without storing the entire string in memory. We can use a small array to count the occurrences of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. After counting, we can construct and print the new sum directly.\n\nThis approach uses a \"counting sort\" algorithm, which is highly efficient for a small, fixed range of input values. To further optimize for memory, we will use the smallest possible data types for our variables that can still hold the required range of values.\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program solves the Xenia and Sum problem with maximum memory efficiency.\n * It reads the input sum character by character, counts the occurrences of\n * numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then prints the sorted sum.\n *\n * Data types are chosen to minimize memory usage:\n * - short int for counts: The maximum count for any number is ~500 (for a 1000-char\n *   string like \"1+1+...+1\"), which fits within a short int (typically 2 bytes).\n * - char for single-character input and a boolean flag.\n * - short int for loop counters, as they don't exceed the range of a short.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Declare variables using memory-efficient types\n    short int counts[4] = {0}; // counts[0] for '1', counts[1] for '2', etc.\n    short int i, j;            // Loop counters\n    char c;                    // Variable to store one character of input\n    char is_first_term = 1;    // Flag to handle printing the '+' separator\n\n    // Read the input character by character and count the numbers\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the sorted sum\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            // If this is not the very first term, print a '+' before the number\n            if (!is_first_term) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            // Print the number (i=0 is '1', i=1 is '2', etc.)\n            putchar(i + '1');\n            // After the first term is printed, all subsequent terms need a '+'\n            is_first_term = 0;\n        }\n    }\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory used for variables (`m`) is calculated by summing the sizes of all variables declared in the `main` function. We assume standard sizes for data types on typical competitive programming platforms (`char`: 1 byte, `short int`: 2 bytes).\n\n1.  `short int counts[4]`: An array of 4 `short int` elements.\n    *   Memory = 4 * `sizeof(short int)` = 4 * 2 bytes = **8 bytes**.\n2.  `short int i, j`: Two `short int` variables for loop counters.\n    *   Memory = 2 * `sizeof(short int)` = 2 * 2 bytes = **4 bytes**.\n3.  `char c`: A single `char` variable to read input.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n4.  `char is_first_term`: A single `char` used as a boolean flag.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\n\nm = 8 (counts) + 4 (i, j) + 1 (c) + 1 (is\\_first\\_term) = 14 bytes.\n\n<<<14>>>"
