    "To find the separatrix of the system, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. The system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Find Equilibrium Points**\nWe set $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the equilibrium values for $u$ are $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 2d^2 = 0$\n    This gives $d=0$. So, one equilibrium point is $(d, u) = (0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0$\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, two more equilibrium points are $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the upper half-plane are $E_1=(0,0)$, $E_2=(0,1)$, and $E_3=(-1,1)$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Stability of Equilibrium Points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$:\n$$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At $E_2 = (0, 1)$:**\n    $$J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since both are positive, $E_2$ is an unstable node (source).\n\n*   **At $E_3 = (-1, 1)$:**\n    $$J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, $E_3$ is a saddle point.\n\n**3. Identify the Separatrix**\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices.\n\nLet's analyze the saddle point at $E_3 = (-1, 1)$.\n*   **Stable Manifold:** The stable manifold corresponds to the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = -2$. The associated eigenvector $v_1$ is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_1 I)v_1 = 0$:\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix} -2 - (-2) & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - (-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    This implies $v_u=0$, so the eigenvector is of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This vector is horizontal, indicating that the stable manifold is tangent to the line $u=1$ at the saddle point. Since the equation $u'(t)=(u-1)u^2$ is zero for $u=1$, the entire line $u=1$ is an invariant manifold. Trajectories starting on this line stay on this line. Therefore, the stable manifold of the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ is the line $u=1$.\n\nThe line $u=1$ acts as a separatrix. To see this, we can analyze the sign of $u'(t)$:\n*   If $u > 1$, then $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 > 0$, so $u(t)$ increases and trajectories move away from the line $u=1$.\n*   If $0 \\leq u < 1$, then $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 \\leq 0$, so $u(t)$ decreases and trajectories also move away from the line $u=1$.\n\nTrajectories starting on the line $u=1$ (the stable manifold) converge to the saddle point $(-1,1)$ (for initial $d<0$), whereas trajectories starting anywhere off this line are repelled from it. This line clearly separates the phase plane into regions with different dynamics for the $u$ variable. Thus, the line $u=1$ is the separatrix.\n\nWe can also find one branch of the unstable manifold. By testing for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$, we can verify that $d=-u^2$ is an exact solution curve of the system, connecting the saddle point $(-1,1)$ to the origin $(0,0)$. This curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle for $u \\in$. While unstable manifolds are also separatrices, the line $u=1$ provides the most significant global separation of the phase plane's behavior.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the line $u=1$.>>>"
