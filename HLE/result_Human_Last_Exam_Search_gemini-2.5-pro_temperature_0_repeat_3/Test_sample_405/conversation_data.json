    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent waxy solid that is white in its pure form. It can appear yellowish due to impurities or upon exposure to light, and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus in this state.\n\nRed phosphorus has a deep red color. There is also a form described as red/brown, which has been shown to be stable in air for several weeks and has distinct properties from the common red phosphorus.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a crystalline form of phosphorus with a violet color.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope and has a black, shiny appearance, similar to graphite.\n\nA more recently discovered allotrope is blue phosphorus, which has a layered structure. As its name suggests, it is blue.\n\nAnother allotrope, diphosphorus (Pâ‚‚), exists as a gas at very high temperatures, and its observable color under normal conditions is not described.\n\n<<<5>>>"
