    "By leveraging advanced techniques in surface code architecture, specifically the \"mixed diamond-hole\" design, it is possible to encode a significant number of logical qubits within a given area. In a standard surface code, the number of logical qubits is often directly related to the number of holes, typically with one or two holes encoding a single logical qubit. However, by engineering the boundaries of these holes to have a \"mixed\" nature (a combination of \"open\" and \"closed\" boundaries), a much denser packing of logical information can be achieved.\n\nA notable example of this is the mixed diamond-hole surface code. Research has shown that a single patch of this type of surface code with just two specialized holes can encode as many as five logical qubits. This is a substantial increase compared to more conventional surface code layouts.\n\nThe term \"patches\" in the context of surface codes usually refers to distinct, independent regions of the code. Therefore, if a single patch with two holes can encode a maximum of five logical qubits, two such independent patches would together encode double that amount.\n\n<<<10>>>"
