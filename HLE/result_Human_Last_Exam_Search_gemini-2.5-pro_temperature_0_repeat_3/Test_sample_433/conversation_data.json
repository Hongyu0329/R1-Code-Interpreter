    "### No Storage Permitted for Opened Single-Dose Ampules\n\nOnce a single-dose glass ampule is punctured or opened in a sterile environment, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period. This guideline is firmly established by leading regulatory and pharmacopeial standards to prevent the risk of microbial contamination.\n\nAccording to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>, which sets the standards for sterile compounding, opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any length of time. This is because, unlike vials which have a rubber stopper that can be resealed, an ampule is a sealed glass container that cannot be closed again in a sterile manner after being broken open. This direct exposure to the surrounding environment significantly increases the risk of contamination.\n\nThis directive for immediate use is echoed by other regulatory bodies. For instance, the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) in Canada explicitly states that no storage of an open ampule is permitted. Similarly, regulations such as California's Code of Regulations specify that single-dose ampules are for immediate use only and shall not be stored for any time period once opened.\n\nWhile the guidelines for single-dose *vials* allow for a Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of up to 12 hours after the initial puncture if maintained in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air quality environment, these rules do not apply to ampules. The fundamental difference lies in the inability to maintain the sterility of an ampule after it has been opened.\n\nTherefore, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is immediate use only, with any remaining contents being discarded immediately after the dose is withdrawn.\n\n<<<Immediate use only; must not be stored for any period of time.>>>"
