    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the **cardinality of the continuum**, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This is the same as the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHere is a summary of the argument leading to this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Properties of the function `f`\n\nLet's analyze the properties a continuous function $f$ must have to satisfy the given equation.\n*   **Injectivity**: The function $f$ must be injective (one-to-one). If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, $x_1 = x_2$.\n*   **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### 2. Case 1: `f` is strictly decreasing\n\nThis case leads to a contradiction.\n1.  If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f(f(x))$ is strictly increasing, which is consistent with $\\exp(x)$ being strictly increasing.\n2.  The range of $f(f(x)) = e^x$ is $(0, \\infty)$. Let the range of $f$ be the interval $(a, b)$. For $f$ to map $\\mathbb{R}$ to $(a,b)$ decreasingly, we must have $a = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$ and $b = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$.\n3.  The composition $f \\circ f$ maps the range of $f$, which is $(a,b)$, to $(0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, it maps $(a,b)$ to $(\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y))$.\n4.  This implies $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = \\infty$. Since $f$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, $a$ cannot be a finite number, so $a = -\\infty$.\n5.  It also implies $\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y) = 0$. For $f$ to be continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, $b$ must be a finite number, and we must have $f(b) = 0$.\n6.  The range of $f$ is $(-\\infty, b)$, which means $f(x) < b$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n7.  Let's evaluate $f$ at $x=0$. We have $f(0) < b$.\n8.  From the original equation, $f(f(b)) = e^b$. Since $f(b)=0$, this gives $f(0) = e^b$.\n9.  Combining these two results, we get the inequality $e^b < b$.\n10. However, the inequality $e^x < x$ has no real solutions; in fact, $e^x \\ge x+1 > x$ for all real $x$. This contradiction shows that no strictly decreasing continuous function can satisfy the given equation.\n\n### 3. Case 2: `f` is strictly increasing\n\nThis case yields a family of solutions.\n1.  If $f$ is strictly increasing, it can be shown that $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If there were a fixed point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = x_0$, which would mean $e^{x_0} = x_0$, an equation with no real solutions.\n2.  Let's define $f(0) = c$. Then $f(c) = f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$.\n3.  Since $f(x) > x$, we have $c = f(0) > 0$ and $1 = f(c) > c$. This means $c$ must be a number in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n4.  The function $f$ restricted to the interval $[0, c]$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps $[0, c]$ to $[c, 1]$. Let's call this restriction $h(x)$.\n5.  The crucial insight is that we can choose $c$ to be any number in $(0, 1)$, and for each such $c$, we can choose $h(x)$ to be (almost) any continuous, strictly increasing function from $[0, c]$ to $[c, 1]$ that also satisfies $h(x) > x$.\n6.  Once $h(x)$ is defined on $[0, c]$, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all other real numbers by the original equation and the relation $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$. For instance, for $x \\in [c, 1]$, $x$ is in the range of $h$, so $x=h(y)$ for some $y \\in [0, c]$. Then $f(x) = f(h(y)) = f(f(y)) = e^y = e^{h^{-1}(x)}$. This process can be extended to define $f$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n7.  The number of ways to choose the constant $c \\in (0, 1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n8.  For any fixed $c$, the number of possible functions $h:[0, c] \\to [c, 1]$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$. We can, for example, start with a simple linear function and add various \"bump\" functions to create infinitely many distinct valid functions.\n9.  The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $c$ and the number of choices for $h$, which is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n10. The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since the set of solutions is a subset of this, its cardinality cannot exceed $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nCombining these points, the number of solutions is both at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the cardinality of the set of these functions is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$. This problem is a well-known example of finding a functional square root.\n\n<<<the cardinality of the continuum ($\\mathfrak{c}$)>>>"
