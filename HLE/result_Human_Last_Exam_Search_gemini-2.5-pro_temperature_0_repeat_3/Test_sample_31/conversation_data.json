    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube while using the CFOP method, a minimum of **five** non-top-facing stickers must be observed.\n\nThis is based on the widely used \"2-side PLL recognition\" method, where the solver looks at the side stickers of the last layer on two adjacent faces (for example, the Front and Right faces). This view presents a total of six stickers: three on the front face and three on the right face of the top layer.\n\nHowever, to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases, it is not always necessary to see all six of these stickers. Advanced recognition systems, such as the Straughan recognition concept, have determined that one of these six stickers is redundant. The minimum number of stickers required to differentiate every possible PLL permutation is five. This typically involves observing one sticker from each of the three visible corners and the two visible edge pieces. While some specific PLL cases can be identified with fewer stickers by recognizing unique patterns like \"headlights\" or \"bars,\" a solver must be prepared to view up to five stickers to guarantee the correct identification of any case.\n\n<<<5>>>"
