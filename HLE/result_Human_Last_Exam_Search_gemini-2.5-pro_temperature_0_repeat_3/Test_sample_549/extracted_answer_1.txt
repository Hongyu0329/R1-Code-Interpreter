The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor, known as the weak localization correction, is given by the formula:

`Δσ = - (e² / (2π²ħ)) * (1/l - 1/L_φ)`

Where:
*   `Δσ` is the change in conductivity.
*   `e` is the elementary charge.
*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.
*   `l` is the electron's mean free path, determined by elastic scattering.
*   `L_φ` is the electron's phase coherence length, determined by inelastic scattering.

The negative sign signifies that this quantum interference effect reduces the conductivity.
