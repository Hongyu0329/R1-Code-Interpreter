    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide proceeds through a two-step sequence involving directed ortho-metalation followed by electrophilic quenching.\n\n**Step 1: Directed ortho-metalation**\n\nThe first step involves the reaction with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). This set of reagents is used to perform a directed ortho-metalation (DoM). In this reaction, a functional group on an aromatic ring, known as a directing metalation group (DMG), directs the deprotonation by the strong base (sec-BuLi) to a specific ortho-position.\n\nThe starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, has two such directing groups:\n1.  The N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) at position C1.\n2.  The dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position C3.\n\nBoth tertiary amide and tertiary amine groups can function as DMGs. However, the tertiary amide group is a significantly more powerful directing group than the tertiary amine. Therefore, lithiation will occur at one of the positions ortho to the amide group, which are the C2 and C6 positions.\n\nThe C2 position is also ortho to the dimethylamino group, while the C6 position is meta to it. The dimethylamino group will also direct the lithiation to its ortho positions (C2 and C4). Due to the synergistic effect of both the strong amide director and the weaker amine director, deprotonation occurs preferentially at the C2 position, which is activated by both groups. The addition of TMEDA enhances the basicity of the sec-BuLi, facilitating the deprotonation. This forms a 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quenching**\n\nThe second step is the reaction with methyl iodide (CH₃I). The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile. It reacts with the electrophilic methyl iodide, where the lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group.\n\n**Final Product**\n\nThe final compound obtained from this reaction sequence is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
