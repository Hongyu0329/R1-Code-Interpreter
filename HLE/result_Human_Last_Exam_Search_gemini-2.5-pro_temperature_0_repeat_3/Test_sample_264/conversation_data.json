    "To solve this problem, we first need to define the two cubes and the shift.\n\nLet the first cube, C1, be defined by the set of points (x, y, z) such that:\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe second cube, C2, is shifted relative to the first. The problem states the shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. Let's consider two common interpretations:\n\n**Interpretation 1: The shift vector's components are 1/2.**\nIn this case, the shift vector **s** is (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This means the second cube, C2, is defined by:\n1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region where the conditions for both C1 and C2 are met. We find this by taking the maximum of the lower bounds and the minimum of the upper bounds for each coordinate:\nmax(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\nmax(0, 1/2) ≤ y ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\nmax(0, 1/2) ≤ z ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThis intersection forms a smaller cube. The side length of this intersection cube is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 for each dimension.\nThe volume of this intersection is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n**Interpretation 2: The magnitude (length) of the shift is 1/2.**\nThe shift is along the main diagonal, so the shift vector **s** must be in the direction of the diagonal vector **d** = (1, 1, 1). To get a unit vector in this direction, we divide **d** by its magnitude, which is ||**d**|| = √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3.\nThe unit vector is **u** = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).\n\nThe shift vector **s** has a magnitude of 1/2, so **s** = (1/2) * **u** = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\nLet s_coord = 1/(2√3). The second cube, C2, is defined by:\ns_coord ≤ x ≤ 1 + s_coord\ns_coord ≤ y ≤ 1 + s_coord\ns_coord ≤ z ≤ 1 + s_coord\n\nThe intersection is then defined by:\ns_coord ≤ x ≤ 1\ns_coord ≤ y ≤ 1\ns_coord ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThe side length of this intersection cube is (1 - s_coord) = (1 - 1/(2√3)).\nThe volume would be (1 - 1/(2√3))³.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe phrasing \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is more commonly used in geometry problems to imply that the components of the shift along the primary axes are each 1/2, as in Interpretation 1. This leads to a clean, exact fractional answer. The second interpretation, while a valid reading of the language, results in a more complex expression involving a cube root. Given the context of typical math competition problems, the first interpretation is the most probable intended meaning. The intersection of two axis-aligned cubes is found by determining the overlap in each dimension.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the intersection is the volume of a cube with a side length of 1/2.\n\nVolume = (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
