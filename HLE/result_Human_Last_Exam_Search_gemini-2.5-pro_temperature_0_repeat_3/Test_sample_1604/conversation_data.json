While she created other paintings depicting World War I scenes, such as *The Retreat from Mons* (depicting a 1914 event) and *A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders* (a general scene from the war), the Charge at Huj is the latest specific and dated battle that she is known to have painted.\n\n<<<The Charge at Huj>>>"
