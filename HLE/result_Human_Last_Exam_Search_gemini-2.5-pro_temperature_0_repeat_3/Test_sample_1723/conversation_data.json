    "While several mushroom species are known for their striking blue coloration, there is no single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print. The color of a mushroom's cap or flesh does not determine the color of its spores.\n\nA notable example is the genus *Entoloma*, which includes the vibrant blue mushroom *Entoloma hochstetteri*. Despite its intense blue appearance, its spore print is characteristically reddish-pink or pink. This species is native to New Zealand and India and is famous for its brilliant blue color.\n\nAnother well-known blue mushroom is *Lactarius indigo*, which is found in North and Central America. This species also has a blue cap and exudes a blue latex-like milk when cut. However, its spore print is a cream to pale yellowish color.\n\nMushroom identification relies on a combination of features, and spore print color is a critical diagnostic characteristic. Spore prints come in a range of colors, including white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, purple-brown, and black, but blue is not a documented spore print color for any known mushroom genus.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
