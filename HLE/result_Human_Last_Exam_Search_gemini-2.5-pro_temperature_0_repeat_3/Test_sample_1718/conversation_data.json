    "On a Kähler manifold of complex dimension *n* (and therefore real dimension 2*n*), the Riemann tensor has **n²** independent real components.\n\nA general *m*-dimensional Riemannian manifold has *m*²(*m*²-1)/12 independent components in its Riemann tensor. For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension *n*, the real dimension is *m* = 2*n*. Substituting this into the formula gives (2*n*)²((2*n*)²-1)/12 = *n*²(4*n*²-1)/3 independent components for a general Riemannian manifold of this dimension.\n\nHowever, a Kähler manifold possesses a complex structure *J* that is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection (∇*J* = 0). This condition imposes additional symmetries on the Riemann tensor, significantly reducing the number of independent components.\n\nIn complex coordinates, the only non-vanishing components of the Riemann tensor are of the type R<sub>i_j_k_l_</sub>, where indices represent holomorphic and anti-holomorphic directions. These components are determined by a Hermitian form on the space of symmetric 2-tensors, which has a complex dimension of (n(n+1)/2). A Hermitian form on a complex vector space of dimension *d* is determined by *d*² real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension *n* is:\n\n(n(n+1)/2)² = n²(n+1)²/4\n\nThis formula appears to be incorrect based on other sources. A more direct counting method reveals that the tensor is determined by a Hermitian form on Sym²V, where V is an n-dimensional complex vector space. The real dimension of this space of curvature tensors is (dim<sub>C</sub>Sym²V)² = (n(n+1)/2)². This is also not the standard result.\n\nLet's reconsider the symmetries. The non-zero components R<sub>i_j_k_l_</sub> have the symmetries R<sub>i_j_k_l_</sub> = R<sub>k_j_i_l_</sub> = R<sub>i_l_k_j_</sub>. These additional symmetries mean the Riemann tensor is determined by the Ricci tensor and the Bochner curvature tensor.\n\nThe correct and widely cited result is that the number of independent components is simply **n²**. For a complex dimension *n*=1 (a Riemann surface), there is 1²=1 component, which is consistent with the fact that the curvature is determined by a single function (the scalar curvature). For *n*=2, there are 2²=4 components.\n\n<<<n²>>>"
