    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The group $G$ is uniquely determined up to isomorphism over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is because the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that the automorphism group of $G$ is connected. By the Lang-Steinberg theorem, the first Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G)$ is trivial. This means that any two groups of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are isomorphic, and therefore, $G$ must be the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$.\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula:\n$$ N = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |W|} $$\nwhere:\n*   $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ is the order of the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$.\n*   $T_0$ is a split maximal torus of $G$, and $|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ is the order of its group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points.\n*   $W$ is the Weyl group of $G$, and $|W|$ is its order.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, these components are as follows:\n\n1.  **The order of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$**: The group $G$ has rank $r=8$ and 240 roots, of which $N=120$ are positive. The degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group are $d_i = 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30$. The order of the finite group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{120} \\prod_{i=1}^{8} (q^{d_i} - 1) $$\n    $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1) $$\n\n2.  **The order of $T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)$**: A split maximal torus $T_0$ has rank 8. Its group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times)^8$. Therefore, its order is:\n    $$ |T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8 $$\n\n3.  **The order of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$**: The Weyl group of type $E_8$ is a finite group of order:\n    $$ |W(E_8)| = 696,729,600 = 2^{14} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 $$\n    This value is confirmed by numerous sources.\n\nCombining these values, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is:\n$$ N = \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8 \\cdot 696,729,600} $$\n\nThis expression can be simplified by expanding each term $(q^{d_i}-1)$ as $(q-1)(1+q+\\dots+q^{d_i-1})$:\n$$ N = \\frac{q^{120} \\prod_{i=1}^{8} (1+q+q^2+\\dots+q^{d_i-1})}{696,729,600} $$\nwhere the degrees $d_i$ are $2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30$.\n\nThis formula gives the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for any finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n<<<The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8 \\cdot 696,729,600} $$>>>"
