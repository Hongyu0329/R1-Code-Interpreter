    "A key distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods in executing a cambré derrière lies in the placement of the hip. While other elements such as arm and head placement, speed, and the degree of the backbend also differ, the approach to the hip is a foundational difference between the two techniques.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso and hips. The backbend, or cambré, should be initiated from the upper back, with the spine acting as the \"stem of aplomb,\" ensuring correct posture and alignment. This method prioritizes a clean, classical line, avoiding any distortion of the torso. The arms in the Vaganova style are noted for being delicate and held in harmonious, well-set poses.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method often features a more dynamic and less rigid torso. A notable characteristic of the Balanchine style is the opening of the hip in movements to the rear, such as in an arabesque, to create the illusion of a higher leg line. This technique allows for a greater range of motion and a more \"three-dimensional spiral\" of the upper body. Balanchine's style is also characterized by faster movements and a unique musicality. The arm and head placements in the Balanchine method are often more expressive and can deviate from the classical Vaganova positions.\n\nWhile all the answer choices represent valid differences between the two methods in a broader sense, the placement of the hip during a cambré derrière is a fundamental and visually distinct point of divergence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
