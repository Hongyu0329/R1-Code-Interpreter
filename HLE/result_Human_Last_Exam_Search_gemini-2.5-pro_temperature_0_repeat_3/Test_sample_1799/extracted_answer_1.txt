It is not entirely true that the second postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first. While the constancy of the speed of light can be derived from the first postulate combined with other physical principles, such as Maxwell's equations or general assumptions about the homogeneity and isotropy of space, the second postulate is what uniquely defines special relativity and distinguishes it from other theories like Galilean relativity. Therefore, it is generally considered a necessary component of the theory's foundation.
