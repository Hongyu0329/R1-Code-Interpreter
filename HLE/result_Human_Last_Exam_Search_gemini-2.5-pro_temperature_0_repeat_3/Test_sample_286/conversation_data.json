    "Let $N = 100000$. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer $M$ such that for any sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N \\in$, there exists a sequence $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_N$ with each $x_k \\in [-1+10^{-M}, 1-10^{-M}]$ and satisfying $|x_{k-1} - x_k| = a_k$ for $k=1, \\dots, N$.\n\nThe condition $|x_{k-1} - x_k| = a_k$ is equivalent to $x_k = x_{k-1} \\pm a_k$. This means we can write $x_k$ in terms of the starting point $x_0$ and the sequence $a_i$:\n$x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} s_i a_i$, where each $s_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\n\nFor a given sequence $a_1, \\dots, a_N$, the problem states that there must *exist* a starting point $x_0$ and a sequence of signs $s_1, \\dots, s_N$ such that all $x_k$ (for $k=0, \\dots, N$) lie in the interval $I_M = [-1+10^{-M}, 1-10^{-M}]$.\n\nLet $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} s_i a_i$ for $k \\ge 1$, and $S_0 = 0$. The condition is that $x_0 + S_k \\in I_M$ for all $k=0, \\dots, N$.\nLet $S_{\\min} = \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$ and $S_{\\max} = \\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$. For a chosen sequence of signs, the values $\\{x_0+S_k\\}$ span an interval of length $S_{\\max} - S_{\\min}$. For this entire range to fit within $I_M$, its length must be less than or equal to the length of $I_M$.\nThe length of $I_M$ is $(1-10^{-M}) - (-1+10^{-M}) = 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\nSo, for any given sequence $a_i$, we must be able to choose the signs $s_i$ such that the resulting range of partial sums, $R(a) = \\min_{\\{s_i\\}} (S_{\\max} - S_{\\min})$, satisfies:\n$R(a) \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n\nThis must hold for *any* sequence $a_i$. Therefore, $M$ must be large enough to handle the worst-case sequence $a_i$, the one that maximizes this minimum range. Let $V_N = \\sup_{\\{a_i\\}} R(a)$. The condition on $M$ becomes:\n$V_N \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n\nThis problem is a known result in discrepancy theory. For $N=100000$, which is an even integer, the supremum of the minimum range of the partial sums is given by:\n$V_N = 2 - \\frac{2}{N}$.\n\nIn our case, $N = 100000 = 10^5$. So, the maximum possible range is:\n$V_{100000} = 2 - \\frac{2}{100000} = 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-5}$.\n\nNow we substitute this value back into our inequality for $M$:\n$2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-5} \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives:\n$-2 \\cdot 10^{-5} \\le -2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$\n\nDividing by -2 and reversing the inequality sign:\n$10^{-5} \\ge 10^{-M}$\n\nTaking the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n$-5 \\ge -M$\n\nMultiplying by -1 and reversing the inequality sign again:\n$M \\ge 5$\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest positive integer $M$ that satisfies this condition. Since $M$ must be greater than or equal to 5, the smallest integer value for $M$ is 5.\n\n"
