    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixels that form the line.\n\nThe steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n1.  Calculate the change in x (dx) and the change in y (dy).\n    *   dx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   dy = 5 - 1 = 4\n2.  Calculate the initial decision parameter. Since dx > dy, the line is x-major.\n    *   p = 2 * dy - dx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n3.  Starting at (1,1), we iterate to find the subsequent pixels. For each step, we increment x by 1. We update the decision parameter to decide whether to increment y.\n    *   If p < 0, the next point is (x+1, y) and p becomes p + 2 * dy.\n    *   If p >= 0, the next point is (x+1, y+1) and p becomes p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx.\n\nFollowing these rules, the sequence of pixels is:\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   **(6, 3)**\n*   (7, 3)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 4)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\nThe line is composed of 11 pixels. The central pixel is the 6th one in this sequence.\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
