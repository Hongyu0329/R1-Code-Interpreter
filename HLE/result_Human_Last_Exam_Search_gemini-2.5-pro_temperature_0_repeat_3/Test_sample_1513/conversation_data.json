    "An island town more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera sharing the town's name is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n\nEaster Island, a special territory of Chile, is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Pitcairn Island, over 2,000 kilometers away. The island was formed by a series of volcanic eruptions, and its landscape is dominated by three main extinct volcanoes: Terevaka, Poike, and Rano Kau.\n\nThe main town and capital of Easter Island is Hanga Roa. The name \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"Long Bay\" or \"Wide Bay\" in the Rapa Nui language, indicating the town is named after the bay on which it is situated. Hanga Roa is located on the island's west coast, in the lowlands between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau.\n\nThe Rano Kau volcano, located next to Hanga Roa, features a large, circular, water-filled crater, which is a volcanic caldera. While Hanga Roa is situated on a bay and is adjacent to this massive caldera, the bay itself is described as being sheltered by the volcano.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
