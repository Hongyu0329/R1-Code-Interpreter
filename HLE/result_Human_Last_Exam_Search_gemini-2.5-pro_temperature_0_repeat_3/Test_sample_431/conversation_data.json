    "There is one Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-1 (GABAAρ1), identified by the UniProt accession number P24046, has a well-defined structure consisting of four transmembrane (TM) domains. These domains are connected by intracellular and extracellular loops.\n\nBased on the annotation in the UniProt database, the domains are located at the following amino acid positions:\n*   **Transmembrane Domain 3 (TM3):** Positions 335-355\n*   **Transmembrane Domain 4 (TM4):** Positions 455-475\n\nThe linker connecting these two domains, known as the TM3-TM4 linker or intracellular loop, spans from the end of TM3 to the start of TM4. This corresponds to the amino acid sequence from position 356 to 454.\n\nThe sequence of this linker is:\nVNYLTTVQERKEQKLREKLP**C**TSGLPPPRTAMLDGNYSDGEVNDLDNYMPENGEKPDRMMVQLTLASERSSPQRKSQRSSYVSMRIDTHAIDKYSR\n\nWithin this specific sequence, there is a single Cysteine (C) residue located at position 377.\n\n<<<1>>>"
