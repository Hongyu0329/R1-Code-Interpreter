    "The problem asks to evaluate the definite integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` from 0 to 1.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the integrand. The expression `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is the result of applying the chain rule to find the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`.\n\nTherefore, the integral is:\n`V = ∫[0,1] (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = [ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1.\nThis evaluates to `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the values of `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)`.\n\n**Calculation at x = 0:**\n*   `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Calculation at x = 1:**\n*   `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)` (where the angle is in radians)\n*   `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\nSince `ln(2)` is positive, `|F₃(0)| = ln(2)`.\nFor `F₃(1)`, we know that 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees, so `sin(1)` is positive. Consequently, `e^(sin(1))` is positive, `1 + e^(sin(1))` is greater than 1, and `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` is positive. Thus, `|F₃(1)| = F₃(1)`.\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression for V:\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\nUsing the property of logarithms, `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\n`V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )`\n\nTo find the numerical value, we use the value of `sin(1)` in radians, which is approximately 0.84147.\n\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.31978`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.31978 = 3.31978`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(3.31978) ≈ 1.19989`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.69315`\n*   `V ≈ ln(1.19989) - ln(0.69315) ≈ 0.18223 - (-0.36651) ≈ 0.54874`\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54874 = 5487.4`\n\nThe closest integer to 5487.4 is 5487.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
