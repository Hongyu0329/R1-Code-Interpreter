    "To determine \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions.\n\nA permutation has a small number of inversions if it is \"close\" to the identity permutation (1, 2, 3, ..., n). The number of inversions is the minimum number of adjacent transpositions (swapping elements at positions `i` and `i+1`) needed to create the permutation from the identity permutation.\n\nA permutation with `k` inversions can be represented as a product of `k` adjacent transpositions. We analyze the structure of permutations with 3 inversions and check if they contain the 1324 pattern.\n\nA permutation with 3 inversions is generated by applying three adjacent transpositions, `s_i = (i, i+1)`, to the identity permutation. The structure of the resulting permutation depends on the indices of the transpositions.\n\nThe types of permutations with 3 inversions are categorized as follows:\n1.  **Three disjoint adjacent swaps**: The permutation is formed by `s_i s_j s_k` where the indices `i, j, k` are far from each other (e.g., `j > i+1`, `k > j+1`). These permutations are of the form `(...i+1, i, ... , j+1, j, ... , k+1, k, ...)`. A detailed analysis shows that these permutations are always 1324-avoiding. The number of such permutations for a length `n` is given by the number of ways to choose three non-overlapping pairs of adjacent positions, which is `\\binom{n-3}{3}`.\n\n2.  **One disjoint swap and one 3-cycle**: The permutation is formed by a combination like `s_i (s_j s_{j+1})` where `i` is far from `j` and `j+1`. This corresponds to a permutation with one pair swap `(i, i+1)` and one 3-cycle on `(j, j+1, j+2)`, where these blocks of positions are disjoint. There are two types of 3-cycles with 2 inversions (`(...j+1, j+2, j,...)` and `(...j+2, j, j+1,...)`). These permutations are also found to be 1324-avoiding. The number of ways to choose the positions for these blocks is `2 \\binom{n-3}{2}` for each of the two 3-cycle types, totaling `4 \\binom{n-3}{2}`.\n\n3.  **A single block of 4 elements being permuted**: These arise from compositions of transpositions with nearby indices, such as `s_i s_{i+1} s_i` or `s_i s_{i+1} s_{i+2}`. These permutations only avoid the 1324 pattern when the block of rearranged elements is at the very beginning or very end of the permutation. For `n \\ge 5`, this gives a constant number of avoiding permutations.\n    *   `s_i s_{i+1} s_i = s_{i+1} s_i s_{i+1}` gives `(...i+2, i+1, i,...)`. These are 1324-avoiding only for `i=1` and `i=n-2`. (2 permutations)\n    *   `s_i s_{i+1} s_{i+2}` gives `(...i+1, i+2, i+3, i,...)`. These are 1324-avoiding only for `i=1` and `i=n-3`. (2 permutations)\n    *   `s_{i+2} s_{i+1} s_i` gives `(...i+3, i, i+1, i+2,...)`. These are 1324-avoiding only for `i=1` and `i=n-3`. (2 permutations)\n    *   `s_{i+1} s_i s_{i+2}` gives `(...i+1, i+3, i, i+2,...)`. These are 1324-avoiding only for `i=1` and `i=n-3`. (2 permutations)\n    *   `s_{i+2} s_i s_{i+1}` gives `(...i+2, i, i+3, i+1,...)`. These are 1324-avoiding only for `i=1` and `i=n-3`. (2 permutations)\n    For `n \\ge 5`, these are all distinct, giving a total of 10 such permutations.\n\nCombining these cases, for `n \\ge 5`, the total number of 1324-avoiding permutations with 3 inversions is given by the formula:\n\\(av_n^3(1324) = \\binom{n-3}{3} + 4\\binom{n-3}{2} + 10\\)\n\nFor this problem, `n = 333`, so we can use this formula:\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\binom{333-3}{3} + 4\\binom{333-3}{2} + 10\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\binom{330}{3} + 4\\binom{330}{2} + 10\\)\n\nNow, we calculate the values of the binomial coefficients:\n\\(\\binom{330}{2} = \\frac{330 \\times 329}{2} = 165 \\times 329 = 54,285\\)\n\\(\\binom{330}{3} = \\frac{330 \\times 329 \\times 328}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 55 \\times 329 \\times 328 = 18,095 \\times 328 = 5,935,160\\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 5,935,160 + 4(54,285) + 10\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 5,935,160 + 217,140 + 10\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 6,152,300 + 10\\)\n\\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 6,152,310\\)\n\n<<<6152310>>>"
