    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ), we can systematically categorize all possible valid expressions of this length and evaluate them. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |.\n\nThe valid expressions can be classified by their top-level structure. An expression `E` must be one of the following forms: `E1 | E2`, `E1 & E2`, `!E'`, `(E')`, or a sequence of unary operators applied to a literal.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the true expressions based on their structure:\n\n### 1. Top-Level Operator is `|`\nThe expression is of the form `A | B`, where the total number of symbols is 5. Due to the precedence rules, we consider expressions where `|` is the last operator to be evaluated. The total length of `A` and `B` is 4.\n\n*   **Expressions of the form `(X&Y)|Z`**: 5 true expressions.\n    *   `T&T|T`, `T&T|F`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T`\n*   **Expressions of the form `X|(Y&Z)`**: 5 true expressions.\n    *   `T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, `F|T&T`\n*   **Expressions of the form `(X|Y)|Z`**: 7 true expressions.\n    *   `T|T|T`, `T|T|F`, `T|F|T`, `T|F|F`, `F|T|T`, `F|T|F`, `F|F|T`\n*   **Expressions of the form `!X|!Y`**: 3 true expressions.\n    *   `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`\n*   **Expressions of the form `X|(Y)`**: 3 true expressions.\n    *   `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`\n*   **Expressions of the form `(X)|Y`**: 3 true expressions.\n    *   `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`\n\nTotal for this category: 5 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 3 + 3 = **26**.\n\n### 2. Top-Level Operator is `&`\nThe expression is of the form `A & B`, where `|` is not the top-level operator. The total length of `A` and `B` is 4.\n\n*   **Expressions of the form `(X&Y)&Z`**: 1 true expression (`T&T&T`).\n*   **Expressions of the form `!X&!Y`**: 1 true expression (`!F&!F`).\n*   **Expressions of the form `X&(Y)`**: 1 true expression (`T&(T)`).\n*   **Expressions of the form `(X)&Y`**: 1 true expression (`(T)&T`).\n\nTotal for this category: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4**.\n\n### 3. Top-Level Operator is `!`\nThe expression is of the form `!E`, where `E` is a valid expression of length 4 that evaluates to False.\n\nThere are 21 distinct valid boolean expressions of length 4 that evaluate to False (e.g., `!!!!F`, `!!(F)`, `(T&F)`, `T&!T`, `!T&!T`, etc.). Each of these, when preceded by `!`, creates a true expression of length 5.\n\nTotal for this category: **21**.\n\n### 4. Top-Level is Parentheses `(E)`\nThe expression is of the form `(E)`, where `E` is a valid expression of length 3 that evaluates to True.\n\n*   The true expressions of length 3 are: `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`, `!!T`, `(T)`.\n*   Encasing these in parentheses gives 6 true expressions of length 5: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(!!T)`, `((T))`.\n\nTotal for this category: **6**.\n\n### 5. Top-Level is `!` and Expression Length is Not 5\nThis category covers expressions of the form `!E` where `E` has a length of 3. The expression `!E` would have a length of 4, but we are looking for length 5. This occurs with expressions like `!(L op L)`. `E` must be a false expression of length 3.\n\n*   False expressions of length 3 are: `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`, `F|F`, `!!F`, `(F)`.\n*   Prepending `!` gives 6 true expressions of length 5: `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`, `!(F|F)`, `!(!!F)`, `!((F))`.\n\nTotal for this category: **6**.\n\n### 6. Other Unary Structures\nThese are sequences of unary operators and parentheses that do not fit the patterns above.\n\n*   `!!!!T` (evaluates to True)\n*   `!!(!T)` (evaluates to True)\n\nTotal for this category: **2**.\n\n### Final Calculation\nSumming the counts from all disjoint categories:\n26 + 4 + 21 + 6 + 6 + 2 = 65\n\nThere are 65 true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols.\n\n<<<65>>>"
