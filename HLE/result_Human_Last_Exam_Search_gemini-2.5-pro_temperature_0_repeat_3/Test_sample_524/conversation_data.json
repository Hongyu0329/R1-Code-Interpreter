    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous space is one where for any two points, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps the first point to the second. A planar continuum is a compact and connected subset of the plane. The classification of such objects results in four distinct classes:\n\n*   **The point:** This is a degenerate continuum, meaning it consists of a single point.\n*   **The simple closed curve (or circle):** This is the most familiar example.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a fractal-like object that is hereditarily indecomposable, meaning it cannot be broken down into two proper subcontinua. It was first shown to be a homogeneous planar continuum by R. H. Bing in 1948.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This is another complex example, constructed as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle. Bing and F. B. Jones demonstrated its existence in 1959.\n\nFor a long time, it was an open question whether other such continua existed. In 2014, L. Hoehn and L. G. Oversteegen proved that this list is complete for non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua, meaning any such object must be homeomorphic to one of these three examples. Including the degenerate case of a single point, this brings the total number of homeomorphism classes to four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
