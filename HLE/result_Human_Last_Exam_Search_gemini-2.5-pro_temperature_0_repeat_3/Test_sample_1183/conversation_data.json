    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a large, planar, aromatic hydrocarbon. Structurally, it can be described as a triangular-shaped fragment of graphyne, a carbon allotrope, characterized by ethynyl (`-C≡C-`) linkers.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group of this molecule, we analyze its geometric structure and the corresponding symmetry elements:\n\n*   **Principal Rotation Axis (Cₙ):** The molecule possesses a threefold rotational axis (C₃) perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the central benzene ring. A rotation of 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Perpendicular C₂ Axes:** There are three twofold rotational axes (C₂) that lie within the molecular plane. Each of these axes passes through the center of the molecule and one of the three corner ethynyl groups.\n*   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σₕ):** As the molecule is planar, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that lies in the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   **Vertical Mirror Planes (σᵥ):** There are three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ). Each of these planes contains the principal C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axis (Sₙ):** The presence of a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane implies the existence of a threefold improper rotation axis (S₃).\n*   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule also has a center of inversion at its geometric center.\n\nA molecule that possesses a principal Cₙ axis and n C₂ axes perpendicular to it belongs to the Dₙ point group family. For this molecule, n=3. The presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) further classifies it into the D₃ₕ point group. The D₃ₕ point group is consistent with all the symmetry elements identified. Examples of other molecules belonging to the D₃ₕ point group include boron trifluoride (BF₃) and the eclipsed conformation of ethane.\n\n<<<D₃ₕ>>>"
