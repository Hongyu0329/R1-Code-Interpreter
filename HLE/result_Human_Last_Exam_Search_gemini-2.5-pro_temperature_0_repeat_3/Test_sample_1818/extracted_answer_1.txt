The optimal Spreading Factor and Transmission Power are not fixed values but are dynamically determined by the network server's Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm. The most energy-efficient combination is always the lowest Spreading Factor (starting from SF7) and the lowest Transmission Power (starting from 2 dBm) that can achieve the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for a Packet Error Rate (PER) of 1% or less, given the specific path loss of the device's location. The server will first increase the transmit power up to 14 dBm for a given SF before switching to a higher, more energy-intensive SF. Therefore, for a device with a clear communication path, the optimal setting would be SF7 at 2 dBm. As the path loss increases, the transmit power will be increased, and only when necessary will the spreading factor be elevated.
