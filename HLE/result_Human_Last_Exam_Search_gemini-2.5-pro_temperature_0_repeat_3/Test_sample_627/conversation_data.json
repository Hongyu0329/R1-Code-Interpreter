    "Vogel's algorithm is a method used to transform any knot diagram into a closed braid representation. The number of strands in the resulting braid serves as an upper bound for the knot's actual braid index.\n\nThe three-twist knot is also known in Alexander-Briggs notation as the 5₂ knot. While the true minimal braid index of the 5₂ knot is 3, Vogel's algorithm does not always yield the minimum possible number of strands.\n\nA paper by Birman and Brendle, available on arXiv, illustrates the application of the Yamada-Vogel algorithm to the 5₂ knot. The process is shown in Figure 4 of the paper, which starts with a standard diagram of the 5₂ knot and, after applying the algorithm's steps, resolves it into a closed braid. By counting the strands in the final braid diagram presented in the paper, it is clear that the resulting braid has 4 strands.\n\nTherefore, using this specific application of Vogel's algorithm, an upper bound for the braid index of the three-twist knot is 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
