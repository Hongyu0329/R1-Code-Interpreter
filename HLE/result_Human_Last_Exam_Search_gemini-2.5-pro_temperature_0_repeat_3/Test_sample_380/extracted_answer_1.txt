The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial. The calculation of normalized magnetic helicity for AIC waves correctly uses the magnetic field components perpendicular to the local magnetic field, along which the waves propagate. The coordinate system used for this calculation is aligned with the local magnetic field, not necessarily the radial direction.
