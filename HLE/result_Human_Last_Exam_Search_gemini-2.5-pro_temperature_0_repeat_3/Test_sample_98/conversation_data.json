    "When an icosahedron tank is positioned to stand on one of its triangular faces, it has a parallel triangular face at the top. Due to the symmetrical nature of the icosahedron, the point at which the tank is half-filled with water corresponds to the geometric mid-height between the base and the top face.\n\nThe cross-section of the icosahedron at this mid-height determines the shape of the water's surface. An icosahedron has 12 vertices. When resting on a face, three vertices form the base, and a corresponding three vertices form the top face. The remaining six vertices are situated on a plane exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces.\n\nThe intersection of this median plane with the faces of the icosahedron forms a regular hexagon. Therefore, when the tank is half-full, the water surface will take the shape of a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
