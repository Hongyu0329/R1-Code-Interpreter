    "The reaction between butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a dienophile) is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, commonly known as the Diels-Alder reaction. In this type of reaction, a six-membered ring is formed.\n\nThe product of this specific reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   1,3-butadiene provides a four-carbon chain with two conjugated double bonds.\n*   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene acts as the dienophile.\n*   Through a concerted mechanism, a new six-membered ring is formed, which contains one double bond. The carbons from the dienophile, one bearing two chlorine atoms and the other two fluorine atoms, are incorporated into this new ring.\n\nThe resulting structure is a cyclohexene ring where two adjacent carbons are substituted with chlorine and fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
