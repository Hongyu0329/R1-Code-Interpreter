    "Until the late 19th century, the Pantheon in Rome's Piazza della Rotonda was flanked by a unique architectural feature: twin bell towers. These towers, added in the 17th century and often attributed to the architect Carlo Maderno, were derisively nicknamed the \"ass's ears\" by the Roman populace.\n\nWhile the user's query specifies the feature was removed in 1950, historical records indicate that the demolition of these controversial bell towers actually occurred between 1881 and 1883. This action was part of a broader effort to restore the Pantheon to its original classical appearance and to clear the piazza of various accretions that had built up over the centuries, including numerous small shops and sheds.\n\nThere is no available information to suggest the removal of any significant or unique architectural feature from the Piazza della Rotonda in or around the year 1950. The most notable architectural alteration to the piazza remains the removal of the \"ass's ears\" in the late 19th century.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers, known as the \"ass's ears\", which were removed from the Pantheon in the late 19th century.>>>"
