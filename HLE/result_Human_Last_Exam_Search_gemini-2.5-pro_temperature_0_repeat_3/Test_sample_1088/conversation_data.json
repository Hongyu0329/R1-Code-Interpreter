    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atom being considered. The notation \"6-311G**\" describes how the atomic orbitals of each atom in a molecule are constructed.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the notation:\n*   **6-311G**: This indicates a triple-zeta split-valence basis set.\n    *   **6**: The core orbitals (like 1s for Carbon) are described by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals are split into three functions. The first is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, while the second and third are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n*   **\\*\\***: These asterisks denote the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first asterisk (*) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n    *   The second asterisk (*) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo determine the total number of primitive Gaussians, one must perform the calculation for each atom in a molecule and then sum the results. Below are the calculations for a hydrogen atom and a carbon atom.\n\n### Hydrogen Atom (H)\n\n*   **Core/Valence (1s orbital)**: Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the 6-311G part applies to its 1s valence orbital. It is described by three functions: one contraction of 3 primitives, and two individual primitive Gaussians.\n    *   Calculation: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (\\*\\*)**: The second asterisk adds a set of p-type polarization functions. A set of p-functions consists of three orbitals (px, py, pz), each represented by a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Calculation: 3 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen**: 5 (from 6-311G) + 3 (from **) = 8 primitive Gaussians.\n\n### Carbon Atom (C)\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital)**: The 1s core orbital is represented by one contracted function made of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   Calculation: 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals)**: The valence shell is described by the \"311\" split. This applies to both the 2s and the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   For the 2s orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   For each of the three 2p orbitals: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   Total for valence: 5 (for 2s) + 3 * 5 (for 2p) = 20 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (\\*)**: The first asterisk adds a set of d-type polarization functions. In the standard Cartesian representation, this consists of 6 primitive d-type Gaussians (dxy, dxz, dyz, dxx, dyy, dzz).\n    *   Calculation: 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Total for Carbon**: 6 (core) + 20 (valence) + 6 (polarization) = 32 primitive Gaussians.\n\nTherefore, to find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule with the 6-311G** basis set, you would sum the counts for each of its constituent atoms. For example, for methane (CH4), the total would be 32 (for Carbon) + 4 * 8 (for each Hydrogen) = 64 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom. For a Hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a Carbon atom, there are 32 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
