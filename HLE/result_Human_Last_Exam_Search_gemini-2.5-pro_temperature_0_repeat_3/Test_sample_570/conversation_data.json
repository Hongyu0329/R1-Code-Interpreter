    "This is a classic problem in convex geometry and the geometry of numbers. The minimal area of such a convex domain is 2.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the result.\n\n### 1. Problem Formulation\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain (a convex set with a non-empty interior) in the Euclidean plane `R^2`. We are given the set of lines `L` defined by the equations `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p,q) = 1`). The condition is that `K` must have a non-empty intersection with every line in `L`. We want to find the minimum possible area of `K`.\n\n### 2. Using the Support Function\n\nThe condition that a convex set `K` intersects a line `px + qy = 1` can be expressed using the support function of `K`. The support function `h_K` is defined for a direction `u` as:\n`h_K(u) = sup {x · u | x ∈ K}`\n\nThe line `px + qy = 1` separates the plane into two half-planes: `px + qy > 1` and `px + qy < 1`. For `K` to intersect this line, it cannot lie entirely in either of these half-planes. This means:\n`inf_{x ∈ K} (px + qy) ≤ 1` and `sup_{x ∈ K} (px + qy) ≥ 1`\n\nUsing the support function, with `u = (p,q)`, this is equivalent to:\n`h_K(u) ≥ 1` and `-h_K(-u) ≤ 1` (which is `h_K(-u) ≥ -1`)\n\nThis condition must hold for all `u = (p,q)` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### 3. Symmetrization and the Dual Body\n\nLet's consider a centrally symmetric convex set `K` containing the origin. In this case, `h_K(-u) = h_K(u)`, so the condition simplifies to `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1` for all coprime integer vectors `(p,q)`. It can be shown that the minimal area is achieved by a centrally symmetric set, so we will proceed with this assumption.\n\nThe polar body `K^\\circ` of a convex set `K` containing the origin is defined as:\n`K^\\circ = {u | x · u ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K}`\nEquivalently, `K^\\circ = {u | h_K(u) ≤ 1}`.\n\nThe condition `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1` for all coprime `(p,q)` means that no such point `(p,q)` can be in the interior of the polar body `K^\\circ`. The interior of `K^\\circ` is the set `{u | h_K(u) < 1}`.\nSo, the problem is transformed into a problem about the polar body `K^\\circ`:\n\n**Find the centrally symmetric convex body `K^\\circ` whose interior is free of coprime integer points and has the maximum possible area.**\n\nMaximizing the area of the polar body `K^\\circ` will minimize the area of `K`. This is due to the Blaschke-Santaló inequality, which relates the areas of a convex body and its polar. A more specific result, the reverse Santaló inequality (or Mahler's inequality) for centrally symmetric bodies in `R^2`, states that `Area(K) * Area(K^\\circ) ≥ 8`. To minimize `Area(K)`, we must maximize `Area(K^\\circ)`.\n\n### 4. Maximizing the Area of the Polar Body\n\nLet `K^\\circ` be a centrally symmetric convex body whose interior contains no coprime integer points. Let `S_c` be the set of points `(p,q)` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n`int(K^\\circ) ∩ S_c = ∅`\n\nThe points `(1,0)` and `(-1,0)` are coprime integer points. Therefore, they cannot be in the interior of `K^\\circ`. Since `K^\\circ` is convex and centrally symmetric, this implies that for any point `(u,v) \\in K^\\circ`, we must have `|u| ≤ 1`.\nSimilarly, the points `(0,1)` and `(0,-1)` are in `S_c`, which implies that for any point `(u,v) \\in K^\\circ`, we must have `|v| ≤ 1`.\n\nThese two conditions together mean that `K^\\circ` must be contained within the square `S^*` defined by `[-1,1] × [-1,1]`.\n`K^\\circ ⊆ S^* = {(u,v) | |u| ≤ 1, |v| ≤ 1}`\n\nTherefore, the area of `K^\\circ` is bounded by the area of the square `S^*`:\n`Area(K^\\circ) ≤ Area(S^*) = 4`\n\nThe square `S^*` is itself a centrally symmetric convex body. Its interior, the open square `(-1,1) × (-1,1)`, contains only one integer point, `(0,0)`, which does not correspond to a pair of coprime integers. Thus, the interior of `S^*` is free of coprime integer points. This means `S^*` is a valid candidate for `K^\\circ`, and it achieves the maximum possible area of 4.\n\n### 5. Finding the Minimal Area\n\nThe minimal area of `K` is achieved when `Area(K^\\circ)` is maximal. We have found that `max Area(K^\\circ) = 4`, and this is achieved when `K^\\circ` is the square `S^* = [-1,1] × [-1,1]`.\n\nThe final step is to find the area of the convex body `K` whose polar is this square `S^*`. The polar of the square `S^* = {(u,v) | |u|≤1, |v|≤1}` is the diamond (or square rotated by 45 degrees) `D` defined by:\n`D = {(x,y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1}`\n\nThe vertices of this diamond are at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0),` and `(0,-1)`. The area of this diamond is:\n`Area(D) = (1/2) * d_1 * d_2 = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`\n\nWe must verify that this diamond `D` satisfies the original condition. The support function of `D` is `h_D(p,q) = max(|p|, |q|)`. For any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, `p` and `q` are not both zero, so `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. Thus, the condition `h_D(p,q) ≥ 1` is satisfied.\n\nSince we have found a convex set with area 2 that satisfies the conditions, and we have shown that any such set must have an area of at least 2 (from `Area(K) \\ge 8 / Area(K^\\circ) \\ge 8 / 4 = 2`), the minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
