    "The rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C, denoted as X = Sym<sup>15</sup>(C), depends on the geometry of the curve C itself. The possible ranks are determined by the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian variety of C, denoted Jac(C).\n\nThe relationship between the ranks is given by the formula:\nρ(Sym<sup>d</sup>(C)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1\nThis formula is valid when the degree of the symmetric power, d, is greater than or equal to g-1, where g is the genus of the curve. In this case, g=3 and d=15, so the condition 15 ≥ 2 is satisfied.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Smallest Possible Rank**\n\nFor a \"very general\" curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian variety Jac(C) has the minimum possible number of endomorphisms, with its endomorphism ring being isomorphic to the integers, Z. In this case, the Néron-Severi group of Jac(C) has rank 1. Such curves are abundant and form a dense open subset in the moduli space of genus 3 curves.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank for ρ(Jac(C)) is 1. This leads to the smallest rank for X:\nρ<sub>min</sub>(X) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**Largest Possible Rank**\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension g is bounded above by g<sup>2</sup>. For the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, this maximum is 3<sup>2</sup> = 9. This maximum is achieved for specific curves whose Jacobians have a large number of endomorphisms, a property known as complex multiplication.\n\nAn example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian achieves this maximal rank is the hyperelliptic curve defined by the equation:\ny<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>7</sup> - x\n\nThis is a smooth curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian, Jac(C), is known to be isogenous to the product of three copies of the elliptic curve E with equation y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> - x. This elliptic curve has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers, Z[i]. For this specific curve, it has been established that the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is 9.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank for ρ(Jac(C)) is 9. This gives the largest rank for X:\nρ<sub>max</sub>(X) = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nCombining these findings, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X can range from 2 to 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
