The best choice of the pair $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is given by the reciprocals of $t_1$ and $t_2$, where $t_{1,2} = \frac{\kappa+1 \pm (\kappa-1)/\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Explicitly:
$(\gamma_1, \gamma_2) = \left( \frac{2}{(\kappa+1) + \frac{\kappa-1}{\sqrt{2}}}, \frac{2}{(\kappa+1) - \frac{\kappa-1}{\sqrt{2}}} \right)$
The order of the two step sizes is interchangeable.
