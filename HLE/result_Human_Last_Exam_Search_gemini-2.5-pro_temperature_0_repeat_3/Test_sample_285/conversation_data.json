    "To determine the largest value of $p$ for which the function $I(a)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need to analyze the decay of the integral $I(a)$ as $|a| \\to \\infty$. The $L^p$ integrability is determined by the slowest possible decay rate of $|I(a)|$.\n\nThe integral is given by\n$$I(a) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i \\Phi_a(x, y)} dxdy$$\nwhere the phase function is a polynomial of degree 3:\n$$\\Phi_a(x, y) = \\sum_{k+l=1}^3 a_{kl} x^k y^l$$\nThis is an oscillatory integral. The decay of such integrals for large values of the parameters (the coefficients $a_{kl}$) is governed by the singularities of the phase function $\\Phi_a(x, y)$. The principle of stationary phase states that the main contribution to the integral comes from the critical points of the phase, i.e., points $(x,y)$ where $\\nabla \\Phi_a(x,y) = 0$.\n\nThe decay rate is slowest when the stationary point is degenerate. The type of degeneracy is classified by singularity theory. The decay rate of the integral is characterized by an exponent $\\sigma$, such that $|I(a)| \\sim |a|^{-\\sigma}$. The exponent $\\sigma$ is given by the log-canonical threshold (lct) of the singularity.\n\nThe set of parameters $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$ for which the phase function $\\Phi_a$ has a singularity of a certain type forms a subvariety in the parameter space. The divergence of the $L^p$ integral is determined by a trade-off between how slow the decay is (smaller $\\sigma$) and how large the parameter subspace is that gives this decay.\n\nLet's denote a singularity type by $s$. Associated with it are two key numbers:\n1.  The Milnor number $\\mu(s)$, which characterizes the complexity of the singularity.\n2.  The decay exponent $\\sigma(s)$, which is the log-canonical threshold of the singularity's normal form.\n\nThe set of parameters $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$ for which $\\Phi_a(x,y)$ has a singularity of type $s$ at some point in the domain has a certain codimension, let's call it $c_s$. For a family of functions on a 2D domain, this codimension is $c_s = \\mu(s) - 1$. The dimension of this parameter stratum is $d_s = 9 - c_s = 9 - (\\mu(s)-1) = 10 - \\mu(s)$.\n\nThe integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da$ is likely to diverge if the integral over the neighborhood of this stratum diverges. A heuristic argument suggests that the condition for divergence is $p \\cdot \\sigma(s) \\le d_s$. Thus, $I \\notin L^p$ for $p \\le \\frac{d_s}{\\sigma(s)} = \\frac{10-\\mu(s)}{\\sigma(s)}$. We are looking for the singularity type $s$ that maximizes this value.\n\nLet's examine the simple singularities of functions on a plane:\n*   **$A_k$ singularities:** Normal form $y^2 + x^{k+1}$ ($k \\ge 1$).\n    *   Milnor number: $\\mu(A_k) = k$.\n    *   Decay exponent: $\\sigma(A_k) = \\text{lct}(y^2+x^{k+1}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{k+1}$.\n    *   Critical $p$: $p_k = \\frac{10-k}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{k+1}} = \\frac{2(k+1)(10-k)}{k+3}$.\n    *   For $k=2$ (cusp singularity): $p_2 = \\frac{2(3)(8)}{5} = \\frac{48}{5} = 9.6$.\n    *   For $k=3$ (tacnode singularity): $p_3 = \\frac{2(4)(7)}{6} = \\frac{28}{3} \\approx 9.33$.\n    *   For $k=4$ (swallowtail singularity): $p_4 = \\frac{2(5)(6)}{7} = \\frac{60}{7} \\approx 8.57$.\n\n*   **$D_k$ singularities:** Normal form $x(y^2 + x^{k-2})$ ($k \\ge 4$).\n    *   Milnor number: $\\mu(D_k) = k$.\n    *   The decay exponent depends on the real form of the singularity. The smallest $\\sigma$ (slowest decay) for $D_4$ (umbilic singularity) corresponds to the normal form $x^2y+y^3$, for which $\\sigma(D_4) = \\text{lct}(x^2y+y^3) = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n    *   Critical $p$ for $D_4$: $p_4 = \\frac{10-4}{2/3} = \\frac{6}{2/3} = 9$.\n    *   For $D_5$, the lct is larger, leading to a smaller critical $p$.\n\n*   **$E_k$ singularities:** $E_6, E_7, E_8$.\n    *   $E_6$: $\\mu=6$, $\\sigma = \\text{lct}(x^3+y^4) = \\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{7}{12}$.\n    *   Critical $p$: $p_6 = \\frac{10-6}{7/12} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 12}{7} = \\frac{48}{7} \\approx 6.86$.\n\nComparing the values:\n*   $A_2$: $p \\le 9.6$\n*   $A_3$: $p \\le 9.33$\n*   $D_4$: $p \\le 9$\n*   $E_6$: $p \\le 6.86$\n\nThe maximum value is obtained for the $A_2$ cusp singularity. The analysis predicts that the integral $\\int |I(a)|^p da$ diverges for $p \\le 9.6$ and converges for $p > 9.6$.\n\nThe largest value of $p$ for which the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ is the supremum of the set of such $p$'s. This corresponds to the threshold value.\n\nFinal Answer is 9.6.\n\n<<<9.6>>>"
