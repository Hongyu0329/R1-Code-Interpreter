    "To find the number that should be filled in the parentheses in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between consecutive terms:\n*   To get from 2 to 11: 2 * 3 + 5 = 11\n*   To get from 11 to 23: 11 * 3 - 10 = 23\n*   To get from 23 to 51: 23 * 3 - 18 = 51\n*   To get from 51 to 119: 51 * 3 - 34 = 119\n\nThis reveals a two-part pattern. The primary operation is to multiply the previous number by 3. Then, a second number is either added or subtracted. Let's examine the sequence of these second numbers: +5, -10, -18, -34. This does not present a simple arithmetic progression.\n\nLet's try another common pattern: multiplying by 2 and adding or subtracting a value.\n*   To get from 2 to 11: 2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n*   To get from 11 to 23: 11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n*   To get from 23 to 51: 23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n*   To get from 51 to 119: 51 * 2 + 17 = 119\n\nThis also does not show a simple pattern in the numbers being added (7, 1, 5, 17).\n\nLet's reconsider the first pattern: `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - k`.\nThe sequence of subtractions `k` is: -5, 10, 18, 34.\nLet's look at the differences between these values:\n*   10 - (-5) = 15\n*   18 - 10 = 8\n*   34 - 18 = 16\n\nThe differences (15, 8, 16) do not follow a clear rule.\n\nLet's try a different approach by looking at the differences between the terms in the original sequence:\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\n\nThe differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no immediately obvious pattern here either.\n\nLet's revisit the pattern `x_{n+1} = 3x_n - k` and re-examine the sequence of subtrahends: 10, 18, 34 (ignoring the first operation for a moment).\n*   18 - 10 = 8\n*   34 - 18 = 16\nThe difference is doubling (8, 16). The next difference should be 32.\nSo, the next number to be subtracted would be 34 + 32 = 66.\n\nUsing this pattern, we can calculate the next term in the main sequence:\n*   Next term = 3 * 119 - 66\n*   Next term = 357 - 66\n*   Next term = 291\n\nThis gives a logical continuation of the discovered pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
