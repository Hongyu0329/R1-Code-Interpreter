    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to find the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nThis expression can be simplified by identifying its components:\n*   The combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the successor function, commonly denoted as `SUCC`. It takes a Church numeral and returns the next one.\n*   The combinator `I` represents the Church numeral for 1.\n*   The expression `S(I)(I)` reduces to the Church numeral for 2. This is because `S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f(f x)`, which is the definition of 2 in Church encoding.\n\nSubstituting these into the main expression, we get:\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is equivalent to `SUCC(1)`, which results in the Church numeral `2`.\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` is equivalent to `SUCC(2)`, which results in the Church numeral `3`.\n\nNow, the original expression simplifies to:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))(3))`\n\nThe combinator `S(I)` also acts as a successor function. Therefore, the expression has a nested structure of successor functions. Let's evaluate the innermost part: `S(I)(K(2))(3)`.\n\nThis is the `S` combinator applied to three arguments: `I`, `K(2)`, and `3`. The reduction proceeds as follows:\n`S I (K 2) 3 = I 3 (K 2 3)`\n`= 3 (K 2 3)` (by the definition of `I`)\n`= 3(2)` (by the definition of `K`)\n\nThe application of one Church numeral to another, `m(n)`, is equivalent to exponentiation, `n^m`. In this case, `3(2)` evaluates to `2^3`, which is 8.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies further to:\n`S(I)(S(I)(8))`\n\nThis is equivalent to `SUCC(SUCC(8))`:\n*   `SUCC(8)` = 9\n*   `SUCC(9)` = 10\n\nThus, the Church integer `n` represented by the expression is 10.\n\nThe final step is to calculate `log_2(n)`:\n`log_2(10) = ln(10) / ln(2) ≈ 2.302585 / 0.693147 ≈ 3.321928`\n\n<<<3.321928>>>"
