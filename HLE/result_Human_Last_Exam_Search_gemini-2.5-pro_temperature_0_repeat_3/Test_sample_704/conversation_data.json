    "On Sir Isaac Newton's colour circle, the range of colours is associated with a musical scale. The colour produced when combining yellow and blue is green. The range on Newton's colour circle between green and blue corresponds to the musical note G.\n\nNewton created his colour wheel by observing the spectrum of sunlight passing through a prism, which he divided into seven colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. He then connected these colours to the seven notes of a musical scale, specifically the Dorian mode, which begins on the note D.\n\nIn this system, the assignments are as follows:\n*   Red corresponds to D\n*   Orange corresponds to E\n*   Yellow corresponds to F\n*   Green corresponds to G\n*   Blue corresponds to A\n*   Indigo corresponds to B\n*   Violet corresponds to C\n\nThe colour produced by mixing yellow and blue pigments is green. On Newton's spectral circle, green is located between yellow and blue. Therefore, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the colour produced by combining yellow and blue (green) and blue itself is primarily associated with the note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
