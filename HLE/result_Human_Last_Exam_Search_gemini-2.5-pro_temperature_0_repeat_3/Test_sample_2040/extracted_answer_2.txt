Based on the current understanding of boron nanosheets' properties, the expectation of them exhibiting spontaneous parametric down-conversion is conditional on their specific crystal structure and external influences. While theoretically possible for certain phases or under specific conditions that break the material's inversion symmetry, it is not a universal property of all boron nanosheets and has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Therefore, a definitive "yes" or "no" is not appropriate without specifying the exact conditions of the nanosheet.
