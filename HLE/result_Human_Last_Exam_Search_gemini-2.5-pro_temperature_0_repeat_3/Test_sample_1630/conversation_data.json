    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of $h(x)$, which are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n### 1. Degree of the Equation\n\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $g(x) = b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The fixed points are the roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n*   By the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n### 2. Conditions on the Derivatives\n\nThe problem states that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n\n*   $f'(x) = 3a_3 x^2 + 2a_2 x + a_1$. For this quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive, so $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$. Also, its discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n*   Similarly, for $g'(x) = 3b_3 x^2 + 2b_2 x + b_1$ to be always positive, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\nThese conditions imply that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions on the entire real line.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the Composite Function\n\nLet's analyze the derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n\nSince $f'(y) > 0$ for any real number $y$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for any real number $x$, their product $h'(x)$ must also be strictly positive for all $x$. This means that $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\nA strictly increasing function can intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times. For example, $h(x)$ can be \"wiggly\" while still being monotonic, allowing for several fixed points.\n\n### 4. Maximum Number of Roots\n\nTo find the number of roots of $k(x) = h(x) - x = 0$, we can use Rolle's Theorem. If $k(x)$ has $N$ roots, then its derivative $k'(x)$ must have at least $N-1$ roots.\n\nLet's analyze $k'(x)$:\n$k'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n\nThe number of fixed points is $N$. The number of roots of $k'(x)=0$ is at least $N-1$. The roots of $k'(x)=0$ are the solutions to $h'(x) = 1$.\n\nLet's determine the degree of $h'(x)$.\n$h'(x) = (3a_3(g(x))^2 + 2a_2 g(x) + a_1) \\cdot (3b_3 x^2 + 2b_2 x + b_1)$.\nSince $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, $(g(x))^2$ is of degree 6. Thus, the first factor is a polynomial in $x$ of degree 6. The second factor is a polynomial of degree 2.\nThe product, $h'(x)$, is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nThe equation $h'(x) = 1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots.\nIf $k'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = 0$ has at most 8 roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, $k(x)=0$ can have at most $8 + 1 = 9$ roots.\n\n### 5. Achievability of 9 Fixed Points\n\nThe argument above shows that the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9. To show that 9 is achievable, one would need to construct or prove the existence of polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and result in 9 fixed points.\n\nThis requires constructing $f$ and $g$ such that the equation $h'(x) = 1$ has 8 distinct real roots. For an 8th-degree polynomial like $h'(x)$ to have 8 real roots for $h'(x)=1$, its graph must be \"wiggly\" enough. Specifically, $h'(x)$ must have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima, and the value 1 must lie between the values of the minima and the maxima.\n\nThe derivative of $h'(x)$ is $h''(x)$, which is a polynomial of degree 7. It is possible for a 7th-degree polynomial to have 7 distinct real roots, which would create 7 local extrema for $h'(x)$. Since $h'(x)$ is of degree 8 with a positive leading coefficient ($9a_3b_3^3 > 0$), it tends to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$. Thus, 7 extrema would consist of 4 local minima and 3 local maxima.\n\nThe 8 parameters of the polynomials $f$ and $g$ (4 for each) provide enough freedom to control the shape and position of the graph of $h'(x)$. It is plausible to choose these parameters such that the 4 local minima are less than 1 and the 3 local maxima are greater than 1, yielding 8 roots for $h'(x)=1$.\n\nIf $h'(x)=1$ has 8 roots, then $k(x)=h(x)-x$ has 8 local extrema. By adjusting the constant term $a_0$ in $f(x)$, which shifts the graph of $k(x)$ vertically without changing $k'(x)$, we can ensure that the values of $k(x)$ at these extrema alternate in sign. This configuration guarantees 9 real roots for $k(x)=0$.\n\nWhile constructing a specific example is complex, the theoretical argument shows no barrier to achieving 9 fixed points. The constraints are not strong enough to reduce the maximum number of fixed points below the algebraic limit of 9. This has been confirmed in mathematical literature, where it's shown that for any degrees $m, n \\ge 2$, there exists a composition of polynomials of these degrees with $mn$ fixed points. The additional constraint of positive derivatives does not alter this maximum.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
