    "In John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, a total of five historical saints are mentioned by name. These figures are revered as saints within major Christian traditions.\n\nThe saints named are:\n\n*   **Mary:** The mother of Jesus is referred to by name in the poem. In Book X, Milton writes of \"Jesus son of Mary second Eve\".\n*   **Saint Peter:** The apostle is mentioned in Book III, where Milton describes a vision of Heaven: \"And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems To wait them with his Keys\".\n*   **Michael:** The archangel, who leads God's army, is a prominent character throughout the poem and is venerated as a saint in Christianity.\n*   **Gabriel:** The archangel, who serves as a chief guard of Paradise, is also a named character and a recognized saint.\n*   **Raphael:** The archangel sent to warn Adam and Eve is another key figure in the narrative who is considered a saint.\n\nWhile other biblical figures such as Adam and Eve are central to the poem, and the word \"saints\" is used in a general sense to refer to the blessed in Heaven, only the five individuals listed above are explicitly named historical figures who are also venerated as saints.\n\n<<<5>>>"
