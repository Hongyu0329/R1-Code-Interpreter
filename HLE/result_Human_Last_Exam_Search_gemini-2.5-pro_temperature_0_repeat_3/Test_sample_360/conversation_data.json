    "The reaction of the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (let's call it L) with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, results in the formation of a tris-chelate complex, `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`.\n\nThe starting material, `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, is a chiral octahedral complex that exists as a pair of enantiomers (Δ and Λ). The ligand L is a symmetric bidentate ligand. When L reacts with `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, it substitutes the two chloride ligands.\n\nThe resulting product, `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`, is a tris(bidentate) octahedral complex of the type `[M(AA)2(BB)]`. Complexes of this type, where AA and BB are symmetric bidentate ligands, are chiral. This chirality arises from the helical arrangement of the three bidentate ligands around the central ruthenium atom, leading to two possible non-superimposable mirror images.\n\nThese two isomers are enantiomers, designated as delta (Δ) and lambda (Λ). Therefore, the reaction forms a racemic mixture containing two isomers, unless a chiral starting material or a method for asymmetric synthesis is used.\n\nWhile the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole can also act as a bridging ligand to form dinuclear complexes, the reaction with `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` to substitute the chloride ions typically yields a mononuclear species. In this mononuclear complex, the ligand L acts as a bidentate chelate.\n\n<<<2>>>"
