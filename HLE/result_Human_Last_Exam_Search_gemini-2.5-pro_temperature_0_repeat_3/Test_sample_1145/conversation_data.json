    "To find the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state, we need to evaluate the integral of the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over this interval.\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the n=2 state, the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density function P(x) is:\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval [x₁, x₂] is calculated by the integral:\nProbability = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx\n\nIn this case, x₁ = 0.495a and x₂ = 0.505a. So we need to calculate:\nProbability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nThe interval Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a is very small and is centered around x = 0.5a. For the n=2 state, x = 0.5a is a node, meaning the wave function and the probability density are zero at this point.\nP(0.5a) = (2/a) sin²(2π(0.5a)/a) = (2/a) sin²(π) = 0\n\nSince the interval is small, we can approximate the integral. We can perform a Taylor expansion of the probability density function around the center of the interval, x = 0.5a. Let's define a new variable y = x - 0.5a, so x = y + 0.5a. The integration limits for y become -0.005a to 0.005a.\n\nSubstituting x = y + 0.5a into the probability density function:\nP(y) = (2/a) sin²(2π(y + 0.5a)/a) = (2/a) sin²(2πy/a + π)\nUsing the identity sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ), we get sin²(θ + π) = sin²(θ).\nP(y) = (2/a) sin²(2πy/a)\n\nFor small values of y, the argument of the sine function, u = 2πy/a, is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation sin(u) ≈ u.\nP(y) ≈ (2/a) (2πy/a)² = (8π²/a³) y²\n\nNow we can integrate this approximate function over the interval for y:\nProbability ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (8π²/a³) y² dy\nProbability ≈ (8π²/a³) [y³/3] (from -0.005a to 0.005a)\nProbability ≈ (8π²/a³) [(0.005a)³/3 - (-0.005a)³/3]\nProbability ≈ (8π²/a³) [2 * (0.005a)³/3]\nProbability ≈ (16π²/3a³) * (0.005)³ a³\nProbability ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\nProbability ≈ (16 * (3.14159)²) / 3 * (0.000000125)\nProbability ≈ (16 * 9.8696) / 3 * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\nProbability ≈ 52.638 * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\nProbability ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThus, the probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
