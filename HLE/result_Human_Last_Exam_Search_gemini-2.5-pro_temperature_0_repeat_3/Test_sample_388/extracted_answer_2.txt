Based on the information, the most important counseling point is the potential for a significant drug interaction. Excedrin contains aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). When taken with Fluoxetine, an SSRI, the risk of bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding, is increased. The pharmacist should advise Allison to avoid using Excedrin or other NSAIDs and recommend a safer alternative like acetaminophen for her headaches. Additionally, the pharmacist should recommend that she follow up with her doctor to discuss the new onset of headaches accompanied by the smell of sea water (phantosmia), as this could be a migraine aura or a symptom of another underlying condition that needs to be evaluated.
