    "Adult Raphidopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predatory insects. Their diet consists of soft-bodied arthropods, with a particular preference for aphids. In addition to preying on other insects, adult snakeflies have also been observed feeding on pollen and other sugary substances. Some studies have found pollen in their digestive tracts, although it is not entirely clear if this is a required part of their life cycle.\n\nBased on the provided choices:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Snakeflies are recorded as feeding on sugary substances, and some adults visit nectar-producing flowers, making this a plausible food source.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Adult snakeflies are significant predators of aphids. While snakeflies are not found in New Zealand where the Totara tree is native, they are known to eat aphids as a primary food source.\n\nThere is no scientific record of adult snakeflies consuming fungus or leaf tissue. Therefore, both nectar and aphids are recorded food sources for adult Raphidopterans.\n\n<<<F>>>"
