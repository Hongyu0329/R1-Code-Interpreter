    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Reaction Analysis:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Aldehyde**: Pivalaldehyde, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It is a sterically hindered aldehyde.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent**: The name (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane describes a phosphorus ylide. The structure is derived from an ethylidene group (=CH-CH₃) attached to the triphenylphosphine core (PPh₃). However, based on common synthesis routes for such ylides, the more plausible interpretation of the name points to (2-chlorobenzyl)methylenetriphenylphosphorane, which has the structure (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃. This ylide is formed from (2-chlorobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium halide and a strong base.\n\n2.  **The Wittig Reaction**:\n    This reaction involves the coupling of an aldehyde or ketone with a phosphorus ylide to form an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde is replaced by the carbon group from the ylide.\n\n    The reaction proceeds as follows:\n    (CH₃)₃C-CHO + (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=PPh₃ → (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄) + O=PPh₃\n\n3.  **Product Identification**:\n    *   The resulting alkene is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n    *   The other product is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\n### Stereochemistry:\n\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting alkene (whether it is the *E* or *Z* isomer) depends on the nature of the ylide.\n\n*   **Unstabilized ylides**, where the carbon of the ylide is attached to alkyl or hydrogen groups, typically react under kinetic control to form the *(Z)*-alkene as the major product.\n*   **Stabilized ylides**, where the carbon is attached to an electron-withdrawing group (like an ester or ketone), are more stable and react under thermodynamic control to favor the *(E)*-alkene.\n\nThe ylide in this reaction, (2-chlorobenzyl)methylenetriphenylphosphorane, has an alkyl group (a substituted benzyl group) attached to the ylidic carbon. It is therefore considered an **unstabilized ylide**. Consequently, the reaction is expected to be *(Z)*-selective, yielding primarily **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. However, factors like the steric bulk of pivalaldehyde and the specific reaction conditions (e.g., presence of lithium salts) can influence the stereochemical outcome.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
