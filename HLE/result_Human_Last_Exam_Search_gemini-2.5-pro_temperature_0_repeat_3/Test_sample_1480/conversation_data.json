    "In the context of fuzzy logic, the rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership degree of the consequent. The firing strength is given by `Phi_k(x′)=0.7`, and the membership degree of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy sets. While several types of t-norms exist, the most common are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm. In the absence of a specified t-norm, the minimum operator is often used as a default.\n\nUsing the minimum t-norm, the calculation is as follows:\nRule Activation Level = min(Φ_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\nRule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)\nRule Activation Level = 0.7\n\nIf the product t-norm were used, the calculation would be:\nRule Activation Level = Φ_k(x') * μG_k_j(y_j)\nRule Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9\nRule Activation Level = 0.63\n\nSince the problem does not specify which t-norm to use, and a single answer is expected, the most common and standard choice, the minimum t-norm, is applied.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
