    "The initial search has provided general information about connected sets, their intersections, and unions. I've learned that the intersection of two connected sets is not necessarily connected. I also found that for two closed sets A and B, their union A U B and intersection A ∩ B are also closed. The problem specifies that the two sets are closed and their union is the unit square. I need to find the maximum number of connected components in their intersection. The initial search didn't provide a direct answer or a theorem that applies to this specific case of the union being a square. I need to look for more specific examples or topological results related to this configuration.The search results confirm that the intersection of two connected sets is not necessarily connected. In the plane, the intersection can even have infinitely many components. However, the problem specifies that the sets are closed and their union is the unit square, which is a compact and connected set. This additional structure is crucial. I found a relevant result which states that if two connected open subsets of the sphere S^2 have the sphere as their union, their intersection is connected. While the current problem deals with closed sets in the plane (a subset of the sphere), this suggests that the number of components might be small. I also found a counterexample showing the intersection of two connected sets can be two points. I need to find a way to construct two closed connected sets in the unit square whose union is the square and whose intersection has a maximal number of components. I will try to visualize such a construction. Let's consider one set 'A' to be a \"comb-like\" structure and the other set 'B' to be its complement within the square, also made connected.\n\nLet A be the set consisting of the top edge of the square, the bottom edge, and vertical line segments connecting them. Let B be the set consisting of the left and right edges of the square, and horizontal line segments connecting them.\n\nLet's refine this idea. Let the unit square be I x I where I =.\nLet A be the union of the top edge { (x, 1) | x in }, the bottom edge { (x, 0) | x in }, and a dense set of vertical lines in between. To make it closed, we need to be careful. Let's try a finite number of lines first.\nLet A_n be the union of the top and bottom edges and n vertical lines x = 1/k for k = 1, ..., n. This is connected.\nLet B_n be the union of the left and right edges and n horizontal lines y = 1/k for k = 1, ..., n. This is also connected.\nThe union A_n U B_n is not the whole square.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let A be a \"checkerboard\" pattern of closed squares, and B be the other set of squares. For A and B to be connected, they must touch at more than just corners. If they touch along edges, their intersection would be a set of line segments. If we have an n x n checkerboard, the intersection would have many components. Let's analyze this.\n\nConsider a 2x2 checkerboard within the unit square. Let the squares be S_ij for i,j in {1,2}.\nLet A = S_11 U S_22. This is not connected. To make it connected, we can add a line segment connecting them, for example, the main diagonal of the unit square. So let A = S_11 U S_22 U { (x,x) | x in }. This is connected.\nLet B = S_12 U S_21. This is also not connected. Let's connect them with the anti-diagonal { (x, 1-x) | x in }. So B = S_12 U S_21 U { (x, 1-x) | x in }. This is connected.\nThe union A U B is the whole square.\nThe intersection A ∩ B is the union of the boundaries of the four small squares, plus the two diagonals. The intersection of the two diagonals is a single point. The intersection of the boundaries of the squares is a grid-like structure which is connected. So in this case the intersection is connected.\n\nLet's reconsider the comb idea.\nLet A be the union of the top edge, the bottom edge, and vertical lines at x = 1/3 and x = 2/3. A is connected.\nLet B be the rest of the square. Is B connected? B is the union of three vertical strips. The middle strip is open on the left and right. The outer strips are closed on one side. To make B connected, we need to connect these three strips. We can add horizontal segments.\nLet A be the set x {0} U x {1} U {1/3} x U {2/3} x. This is connected.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A), where S is the unit square. B consists of three rectangles: [0, 1/3] x, [1/3, 2/3] x, and [2/3, 1] x. These are connected by the top and bottom edges, so B is connected.\nThe intersection A ∩ B is the two vertical lines x=1/3 and x=2/3, and the top and bottom edges. This is connected.\n\nLet's try to create disconnected components in the intersection.\nLet A be a closed connected set. Let B be a closed connected set. A U B = Square.\nLet's think about the boundaries. Let ∂A and ∂B be the boundaries of A and B.\nA ∩ B = (A ∩ ∂B) U (∂A ∩ B) U (∂A ∩ ∂B).\nA key insight might come from the \"lakes of Wada\" construction, which shows that three or more open connected sets in the plane can have the same boundary. While our sets are closed, the boundary idea is important.\n\nLet's try to construct an example with many components.\nConsider a horizontal line segment C1 in the middle of the square. Let A be a small closed neighborhood of C1. A is connected.\nLet B = cl(Square \\ A). B is also connected (it's like a thick C-shape). The intersection is the boundary of A, which is connected.\n\nWhat if A \"snakes\" through the square?\nLet A be a closed tubular neighborhood of a space-filling curve. Then B = cl(Square \\ A) would be a set of disconnected components. We need B to be connected.\n\nLet's go back to the idea of \"fingers\".\nLet A be the union of the left half of the square [0, 1/2] x and a set of horizontal \"fingers\" extending into the right half.\nLet A = ([0, 1/2] x) U U_{k=1 to n} ([1/2, 1] x [y_{2k-1}, y_{2k}]), where 0 < y_1 < y_2 < ... < y_{2n} < 1. This set A is connected.\nLet B be the complement, but we need to make it connected.\nB would be the right half of the square with channels carved out by the fingers of A.\nB = ([1/2, 1] x [0, y_1]) U ([1/2, 1] x [y_2, y_3]) U ... U ([1/2, 1] x [y_{2n}, 1]). This is not connected.\nTo connect these parts of B, we can add the right edge {1} x.\nSo let B = (cl(Square \\ A)) U ({1} x). But then A U B is not the square, since we added the right edge to B, which might already be partly in A.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from a more theoretical standpoint. Let A and B be the two sets. Let C = A ∩ B. We want to maximize the number of connected components of C.\nLet S be the unit square. A, B are closed, connected, and A U B = S.\nLet's use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for homology.\nH_1(A U B) -> H_0(A ∩ B) -> H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) -> H_0(A U B) -> 0\nSince A, B, and A U B are connected, H_0(A) = Z, H_0(B) = Z, and H_0(A U B) = Z.\nThe sequence becomes:\nH_1(S) -> H_0(C) -> Z ⊕ Z -> Z -> 0\nH_1(S) = 0 since the square is simply connected.\nSo we have an exact sequence:\n0 -> H_0(C) -> Z ⊕ Z -> Z -> 0\nLet f: Z ⊕ Z -> Z be the map f(a, b) = a - b. The kernel of this map is isomorphic to Z, which would imply H_0(C) = Z, meaning C is connected.\nHowever, the map in the Mayer-Vietoris sequence is f(a,b) = i_*(a) + j_*(b) where i and j are inclusions. For path-connected spaces, this becomes f(a,b) = a+b. The kernel is {(a, -a) | a in Z} which is isomorphic to Z. This still suggests C is connected.\n\nThere must be a flaw in my application of Mayer-Vietoris. The sequence applies to the singular homology of the spaces. The number of connected components is the rank of the 0-th homology group, H_0.\nThe sequence is ... -> H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) -> H_0(A U B) -> 0.\nLet k(X) be the number of path-connected components of a space X. Then rank(H_0(X)) = k(X).\nSo we have rank(H_0(A)) = 1, rank(H_0(B)) = 1, rank(H_0(A U B)) = 1.\nThe sequence is H_1(A U B) -> H_0(A ∩ B) -> H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) -> H_0(A U B) -> 0.\nLet's denote the ranks: h1 = rank(H_1(S)), c0 = rank(H_0(A ∩ B)).\nh1 -> c0 -> 1 + 1 -> 1 -> 0.\nThe map from Z ⊕ Z to Z is (1, 1) -> 1. The image has rank 1. The kernel has rank 1.\nSo we have an exact sequence 0 -> K -> H_0(A ∩ B) -> Z ⊕ Z -> Z -> 0, where K is the image of the map from H_1(S).\nSince S is a square, H_1(S) = 0. So K=0.\nThis gives 0 -> H_0(A ∩ B) -> Z^2 -> Z -> 0.\nLet g: H_0(A ∩ B) -> Z^2 and f: Z^2 -> Z.\nThe sequence is exact, so Im(g) = Ker(f).\nThe map f is induced by inclusion, f(a,b) = a+b. Ker(f) = {(n, -n) | n in Z}, which has rank 1.\nSo Im(g) has rank 1.\nThis means H_0(A ∩ B) must have rank at least 1.\nLet's look at the sequence again: H_1(S) -> H_0(A ∩ B) -> H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) -> H_0(S) -> 0.\nLet φ: H_0(A ∩ B) -> H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) and ψ: H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) -> H_0(S).\nψ([a], [b]) = [a] + [b]. This map is surjective. The kernel of ψ has rank 2-1=1.\nThe image of the map from H_1(S) is 0.\nSo we have an exact sequence 0 -> H_0(A ∩ B) -> Z ⊕ Z -> Z -> 0.\nThis implies that H_0(A ∩ B) is isomorphic to the kernel of the map Z ⊕ Z -> Z.\nThe map sends (1,0) to 1 and (0,1) to 1. The kernel is generated by (1,-1). So the kernel is isomorphic to Z.\nThis implies H_0(A ∩ B) is isomorphic to Z, which means the intersection is connected.\n\nThis seems to be a general result for any two closed sets whose union is simply connected. Where is the error? The Mayer-Vietoris sequence holds for any triad (X, A, B) where X = A U B, but requires that the interiors of A and B cover X. This is not necessarily true here. A and B are just closed sets.\n\nLet's try to construct a counterexample to the \"intersection is connected\" idea.\nLet the square be S. Let A be the union of the left half [0, 1/2] x and the right half [1/2, 1] x but with a \"channel\" removed.\nLet A = S \\ ((1/2, 1) x (1/3, 2/3)). A is connected. A is not closed. Let's take its closure.\nA' = cl(A) = S \\ ((1/2, 1) x (1/3, 2/3)) U {1/2} x [1/3, 2/3] U [1/2, 1] x {1/3} U [1/2, 1] x {2/3}.\nA' is the square with an open rectangle removed from the right side. A' is connected.\nLet B be the closure of that open rectangle. B = [1/2, 1] x [1/3, 2/3]. B is connected.\nA' U B = S.\nA' ∩ B = {1/2} x [1/3, 2/3] U [1/2, 1] x {1/3} U [1/2, 1] x {2/3}. This is connected.\n\nLet's try to make the intersection disconnected. We need to \"break\" the connection.\nLet A be the union of two disjoint closed disks D1 and D2 inside the square, and a thin path connecting them. A is closed and connected.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). B is connected.\nThe intersection A ∩ B is the boundary of A. The boundary of A is a single closed curve, so it is connected.\n\nLet's try to make A and B interlock like fingers.\nLet S = x.\nLet A be the union of vertical strips: A = [0, 1/3]x U [2/3, 1]x. This is not connected.\nTo connect them, add a horizontal bar: A = ([0, 1/3]x U [2/3, 1]x) Ux[0, 1/3]. A is connected and closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). B is the rectangle (1/3, 2/3) x (1/3, 1). Its closure is [1/3, 2/3] x [1/3, 1]. This is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B is the boundary of the rectangle B. This is connected.\n\nLet's try to make B have two parts that need connecting.\nLet A be a 'U' shape. A = [0, 1/4]x U [1/4, 3/4]x[0, 1/4] U [3/4, 1]x. A is connected and closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A) = [1/4, 3/4] x [1/4, 1]. B is a closed rectangle, so it's connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B is the boundary between them, which is connected.\n\nIt seems that for any \"simple\" construction, the intersection is connected. This suggests that the answer might be 1, or that a more complex, \"pathological\" set is needed.\n\nLet's reconsider the search results. One result mentions that the intersection of two connected sets in the plane can have infinitely many components. Let's see if we can adapt such an example to our case where the union is the square.\n\nConsider the topologist's sine curve. Let C = { (x, sin(1/x)) | x in (0, 1] }. Let L = { (0, y) | y in [-1, 1] }. The set T = C U L is connected and closed.\nLet's try to build our sets A and B from this.\nLet's define a set A that has many \"wiggles\".\nLet A be the graph of y = 1/2 + 1/4 sin(2πn x) for x in for some large integer n, plus the regions above it.\nLet f_n(x) = 1/2 + 1/4 sin(2πn x).\nLet A = { (x,y) | y >= f_n(x), (x,y) in S }. A is connected.\nLet B = { (x,y) | y <= f_n(x), (x,y) in S }. B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B is the graph of f_n(x). This is connected.\n\nWe need to break the intersection into multiple components.\nLet's try to define A and B based on their boundaries. The intersection A ∩ B will be a subset of the boundary of A (and B).\nLet's try to construct A and B such that their intersection consists of several separate \"lakes\".\n\nConsider a set A which is a union of many disjoint closed disks D_i, and a network of thin closed tubes T_j connecting them all together, making A connected. A = (U D_i) U (U T_j).\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). For B to be connected, the complement of A must be connected. This means A cannot separate the square.\nThe intersection is the boundary of A. The boundary of A is a single, albeit complex, connected set.\n\nLet's try a different approach. What if the intersection is not path-connected, but is connected? The question asks for the number of *components*, which usually means connected components.\n\nLet's try to construct an intersection with two components.\nLet A be the left half of the square plus a part of the right half.\nA = [0, 1/2]x U [1/2, 1]x([0, 1/3] U [2/3, 1]). A is connected and closed.\nB = cl(S \\ A) = [1/2, 1] x [1/3, 2/3]. B is a closed rectangle, connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ({1/2} x [1/3, 2/3]) U ([1/2, 1] x {1/3}) U ([1/2, 1] x {2/3}). This is connected.\n\nLet's modify A.\nLet A = ([0, 1/2]x) U ([1/2, 3/4]x[0, 1/3]) U ([1/2, 3/4]x[2/3, 1]). A is connected and closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). B = ([1/2, 3/4]x[1/3, 2/3]) U ([3/4, 1]x). B is connected and closed.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ({1/2}x[0,1/3]) U ({1/2}x[2/3,1]) U ([1/2,3/4]x{1/3}) U ([1/2,3/4]x{2/3}) U ({3/4}x[0,1/3]) U ({3/4}x[2/3,1]). This is still connected.\n\nLet's try to force disconnection.\nLet A be the union of two squares, S1 =x[2/3, 1] and S2 =x[0, 1/3]. And connect them by a thin strip, C = [0, 1/3]x[1/3, 2/3]. So A = S1 U S2 U C. A is connected and closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A) = [1/3, 1] x [1/3, 2/3]. B is a closed rectangle, so it's connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B is the boundary of B that touches A. This is ({1/3} x [1/3, 2/3]) U ([1/3, 1] x {1/3}) U ([1/3, 1] x {2/3}). This is connected.\n\nLet's try to make the intersection be two points.\nLet A be the graph of y = x^2, and B be the graph of y = -x^2 + 2, restricted to the square. These are not subsets whose union is the square.\nLet A be the set of points (x,y) in the square such that y >= x^2. A is connected and closed.\nLet B be the set of points (x,y) in the square such that y <= x^2. B is connected and closed.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B is the graph of y = x^2 inside the square, which is connected.\n\nLet's try to use a space-filling curve. Let f: -> S be a Peano curve. The curve itself is connected.\nLet A be the curve. A is closed and connected.\nB = S. Then A U B = S. A ∩ B = A, which is connected. This is trivial.\n\nLet's try to construct A and B with \"interlocking spirals\".\nImagine two spirals starting from the center and going outwards, filling the whole square.\nLet A be one spiral and B be the other.\nLet's define this more formally using polar coordinates (r, θ) centered at (1/2, 1/2).\nLet A = { (r, θ) | r <= f(θ) } and B = { (r, θ) | r >= f(θ) } for some function f. For A and B to be connected, this doesn't seem to work easily.\n\nLet's reconsider the checkerboard.\nLet S be the unit square. Divide it into an n x n grid of smaller squares S_ij.\nLet A be the union of the \"black\" squares and B be the union of the \"white\" squares.\nTo make A connected, we need to connect all the black squares. They only touch at corners. We can add line segments along the diagonals of the black squares. This seems complicated.\n\nA simpler way to connect them: Let A' be the union of the black squares. Let A = A' U (x{0}). We add the bottom edge of the big square. Since every column has a black square which touches the bottom edge (or can be connected to it via other black squares in the same column), A becomes connected. This is not quite right.\nLet's try connecting all black squares to a central point. This makes A connected.\nLet A = (union of black squares) U { (1/2, 1/2) }. This is not closed.\nLet A = cl( (union of black squares) U { (1/2, 1/2) } ). This is just the union of the closed black squares.\n\nLet's try a different connection method. Let A be the union of the black squares and all the horizontal grid lines. Let B be the union of the white squares and all the vertical grid lines.\nA = U_{i+j is even} S_ij U U_{k=0 to n} ( x {k/n}). A is connected.\nB = U_{i+j is odd} S_ij U U_{k=0 to n} ({k/n} x). B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = (U_{i+j is even} S_ij ∩ U_{k=0 to n} ({k/n} x)) U (U_{i+j is odd} S_ij ∩ U_{k=0 to n} ( x {k/n})) U (U_{k=0 to n} ( x {k/n}) ∩ U_{l=0 to n} ({l/n} x)).\nThe last term is the grid itself, which is connected. So the intersection is connected.\n\nLet's try to construct an arbitrary number of components.\nLet n be a positive integer. We want to construct A and B such that A ∩ B has n components.\nLet's place n small, disjoint closed disks C_1, ..., C_n in the interior of the square. These will be the components of the intersection.\nLet C = U C_i.\nWe need to construct A and B such that A U B = S, A and B are closed and connected, and A ∩ B = C.\nThis seems difficult because A and B would have to be defined in a way that their boundaries meet exactly at the boundaries of these disks.\nLet A = C U (something to connect C and fill up space).\nLet B = (S \\ A) U C.\nLet's try to build A and B from the outside in.\nLet A_0 = S. Let B_0 be a set of n disjoint closed disks in the interior of S.\nLet A_1 = A_0 \\ Int(B_0). A_1 is connected if B_0 doesn't separate S.\nLet B_1 = B_0. B_1 is not connected.\nThis approach doesn't seem to work.\n\nLet's go back to the interlocking fingers idea, but try to make the intersection disconnected.\nLet S =x.\nLet A be the left half of the square, with some fingers removed.\nLet A = ([0, 1/2] x) \\ U_{k=1 to n} ((1/2-e, 1/2] x (y_{2k-1}, y_{2k})). This is not closed.\nLet's define A and B constructively.\nLet A consist of a vertical spine at x=1/2. From this spine, \"ribs\" go out to the left and right.\nLet A = {1/2}x U U_{y in Q ∩} ([1/4, 3/4] x {y}). This is not closed.\nLet's use a finite number of ribs.\nLet A = {1/2}x U U_{k=1 to n} ([1/4, 3/4] x {k/(n+1)}). A is connected and closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B is the boundary of A. This is connected.\n\nLet's try to create two components in the intersection.\nLet A be the lower half of the square, y <= 1/2, plus two squares in the upper half.\nA = (x[0,1/2]) U ([0,1/3]x[1/2,1]) U ([2/3,1]x[1/2,1]). A is connected and closed.\nB = cl(S \\ A) = [1/3, 2/3] x [1/2, 1]. B is a rectangle, so connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = (x{1/2}) U ({1/3}x[1/2,1]) U ({2/3}x[1/2,1]). This is connected.\n\nLet's try to make the intersection be two disjoint line segments.\nLet A ∩ B = ({1/4}x[1/4, 3/4]) U ({3/4}x[1/4, 3/4]).\nLet's call these segments I_1 and I_2.\nWe need to build A and B around them.\nLet A be a thin neighborhood of I_1 and I_2, plus a path connecting them.\nLet A = N(I_1) U N(I_2) U P, where P is a path connecting N(I_1) and N(I_2). Let A be the closure of this.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A).\nIf P is thin, B will be connected.\nThe intersection will be the boundary of A, which will be connected.\n\nThis problem seems to be related to a known result in topology. Let me search for \"number of components of intersection of continua\".\n\nA relevant theorem by Karol Borsuk states that if A and B are two compacta in a metric space, then the number of components of A U B is at most the sum of the number of components of A, B, and A ∩ B. This is not what I need.\n\nLet's try to think about the boundaries again. Let C = A ∩ B. C is a closed set.\nLet's assume C has k components, C_1, ..., C_k.\nA U B = S. A and B are closed and connected.\nConsider the boundary of A, ∂A. ∂A is a subset of A. Since A is closed, ∂A = A \\ int(A).\nSimilarly ∂B = B \\ int(B).\nA ∩ B = (A ∩ B) \\ (int(A) ∩ int(B)).\nThe intersection lies on the boundary of both sets. C = A ∩ B = ∂A ∩ ∂B? Not necessarily.\nC = (A \\ int(A)) ∩ B U A ∩ (B \\ int(B)) = (∂A ∩ B) U (A ∩ ∂B).\nAlso, ∂(A U B) = ∂S (the boundary of the square).\n∂S is a subset of (∂A \\ B) U (∂B \\ A) U (∂A ∩ ∂B).\n\nLet's consider a construction that yields an arbitrary number of components.\nLet n be any integer. We can construct two closed connected sets A and B in the plane whose union is the plane and whose intersection has n components.\nExample for n=2: Let C1 and C2 be two disjoint closed disks. Let A be the union of C1, C2, and a line segment connecting their boundaries. This is not what we want.\n\nLet's try a different construction.\nLet S be the unit square.\nLet A be the lower half of the square, x [0, 1/2]. This is connected.\nLet B be the upper half, x [1/2, 1]. This is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = x {1/2}. This has 1 component.\n\nLet's modify A and B.\nLet A =x[0, 1/2] U [0,1/2]x[1/2, 1]. A is L-shaped, connected and closed.\nLet B =x[1/2, 1] U [1/2, 1]x[0, 1/2]. B is a backward L-shape, connected and closed.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = (x{1/2}) U ({1/2}x). This is a cross shape, connected. 1 component.\n\nLet's try to make the intersection disconnected.\nLet A be the union of two vertical bars and a horizontal connector.\nA = [0, 1/3]x U [2/3, 1]x U [1/3, 2/3]x[0, 1/3]. A is connected and closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A) = [1/3, 2/3] x [1/3, 1]. B is a rectangle, connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ({1/3}x[1/3,1]) U ({2/3}x[1/3,1]) U ([1/3, 2/3]x{1/3}). This is connected.\n\nIt seems that any attempt to create multiple components in the intersection fails because the sets A and B themselves must be connected. If A ∩ B has two components C1 and C2, then any path in A from a point near C1 to a point near C2 must not pass through B.\n\nLet's consider the case where the intersection can have infinitely many components.\nLet A be the union of the graph of y = sin(1/x) (and its limit points on the y-axis) scaled and translated to fit in the square, and the region below it.\nLet f(x) = 1/2 + 1/4 sin(π/x) for x in (0, 1]. Let G be the closure of the graph of f. G is connected.\nLet A = { (x,y) in S | y <= f(x) for x in (0,1] } U { (0,y) in S | y <= 1/2 }. A is connected.\nLet B = { (x,y) in S | y >= f(x) for x in (0,1] } U { (0,y) in S | y >= 1/2 }. B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B is the graph G. G is connected.\n\nLet's try to use the lakes of Wada idea.\nLet D be the open unit disk. Let C1, C2, C3 be three disjoint closed disks inside D.\nIt is possible to construct three disjoint open connected sets (lakes) L1, L2, L3 in D \\ (C1 U C2 U C3) that have the same boundary.\nLet F = D \\ (L1 U L2 U L3). F is the common boundary.\nLet A = L1 U F U C1. A is connected. Is it closed? No.\nLet A = cl(L1). Let B = cl(L2 U L3 U C2 U C3).\nThis gets complicated.\n\nLet's try a simpler approach.\nLet A be a set of \"fingers\" coming from the left, and B be a set of fingers coming from the right.\nLet A = [0, 1/3]x U [2/3, 1]x. This is not connected.\nLet's connect the two parts of A outside the square, which is not allowed.\nThe connection must be within the square.\nLet A = ([0, 1/3]x) U ([2/3, 1]x) U ([1/3, 2/3]x{1/2}). A is connected.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). B has two components: [1/3, 2/3]x(1/2, 1] and [1/3, 2/3]x[0, 1/2). B is not connected.\n\nTo make B connected, we must provide a path within B that connects the top and bottom parts.\nLet's add a vertical segment to B.\nLet A = ([0, 1/3]x) U ([2/3, 1]x) U ([1/3, 2/3]x{1/2}).\nLet B = cl(S \\ A) U ({1/2}x).\nNow B is connected.\nA U B = S U ({1/2}x) = S.\nA is closed. B is closed. A is connected. B is connected.\nWhat is A ∩ B?\nA ∩ B = (A ∩ cl(S \\ A)) U (A ∩ ({1/2}x)).\nA ∩ cl(S \\ A) is the boundary: {1/3}x U {2/3}x U ([1/3, 2/3]x{1/2}). This is connected.\nA ∩ ({1/2}x) = { (1/2, 1/2) }.\nSo A ∩ B = ({1/3}x) U ({2/3}x) U ([1/3, 2/3]x{1/2}) U {(1/2, 1/2)}. This is connected.\n\nThis is surprisingly difficult. Let's assume the answer is not a small integer.\nWhat if the number of components is infinite?\nLet C_n be a sequence of disjoint closed disks in S converging to a point p. Let C = U C_n.\nWe want A ∩ B = C U {p}.\nLet A be a set containing C U {p} and some connecting paths.\nLet A be the union of all C_n and the point p, and line segments connecting each C_n to p. A = U_n (C_n U [c_n, p]) where c_n is a point in C_n. This set is connected. It is also closed.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). Is B connected?\nThe set A looks like a \"starfish\" with infinitely many arms. The complement S \\ A is a single connected region. So B = cl(S \\ A) is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ∂A. The boundary of A is the union of the boundaries of the disks C_n and the boundaries of the line segments. This seems to be connected.\n\nLet's try a different construction for infinitely many components.\nLet A be the union of infinitely many vertical segments.\nLet Q_x = { (q, y) | y in } for q in Q ∩. Let A = U_{q in Q ∩} Q_q. This is not closed.\nIts closure is S. So A_c = S. Let B be any closed connected subset. A_c U B = S. A_c ∩ B = B. B is connected.\n\nLet's try to construct A and B as follows:\nLet S be the squarex.\nLet A be the set of points (x,y) in S such that x is rational. A = (Q ∩) x. This is not closed. cl(A) = S.\nLet A be the set of points (x,y) in S such that sin(1/x) >= 0 for x in (0,1], and B be the set where sin(1/x) <= 0.\nLet f(x) = sin(π/x).\nLet A = { (x,y) | f(x) >= 0, (x,y) in S } U ({0}x).\nLet B = { (x,y) | f(x) <= 0, (x,y) in S } U ({0}x).\nA consists of vertical strips where sin is positive. B consists of strips where sin is negative.\nA = U_{k} [1/(2k), 1/(2k-1)] x U {0}x. This is not closed.\nLet A_c = cl(A). A_c = U_{k} [1/(2k), 1/(2k-1)] x U {0}x. This is closed. Is it connected? Yes, because of the limit point 0.\nLet B_c = cl(B). B_c = U_{k} [1/(2k+1), 1/(2k)] x U {0}x. This is also closed and connected.\nA_c U B_c = S.\nA_c ∩ B_c = ({0}x) U U_{k} ({1/k} x).\nThe intersection consists of the y-axis segment and infinitely many vertical line segments at x=1/k. This set is connected due to the common segment on the y-axis.\n\nTo get disconnected components, we need to prevent them from touching.\nLet's modify the previous construction.\nLet A = cl( { (x,y) in S | sin(π/x) > 0 } ).\nLet B = cl( { (x,y) in S | sin(π/x) < 0 } ).\nA = U_{k} [1/(2k), 1/(2k-1)] x U {0}x. Connected.\nB = U_{k} [1/(2k+1), 1/(2k)] x U {0}x. Connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = { {1/n} x | n is a positive integer } U {0}x. This is connected.\n\nLet's try to get rid of the connecting part at x=0.\nLet's use a function that doesn't accumulate at one end.\nConsider horizontal strips.\nLet A = cl( U_{k in Z} x [2k/n, (2k+1)/n] ∩ S ).\nLet B = cl( U_{k in Z} x [(2k+1)/n, (2k+2)/n] ∩ S ).\nFor a large n, A is a union of disjoint horizontal rectangles. Not connected.\nTo make A connected, add the left edge {0}x.\nLet A' = A U ({0}x). A' is connected and closed.\nLet B' = B U ({1}x). B' is connected and closed.\nA' U B' = S.\nA' ∩ B' = (A U {0}x) ∩ (B U {1}x) = (A ∩ B) U (A ∩ {1}x) U ({0}x ∩ B) U ({0}x ∩ {1}x).\nA ∩ B is the set of horizontal lines y = k/n.\nA ∩ {1}x are the endpoints of the A-strips on the right edge.\n{0}x ∩ B are the endpoints of the B-strips on the left edge.\nThe intersection is a set of horizontal lines, plus some points on the vertical edges. This is disconnected.\nHow many components? n/2 components from the lines in A, and n/2-1 from B, plus points.\nLet's be more precise. Let n=4.\nA = (x[0,1/4]) U (x[2/4, 3/4]). Not connected.\nA' = A U ({0}x). Connected.\nB = (x[1/4, 2/4]) U (x[3/4, 1]). Not connected.\nB' = B U ({1}x). Connected.\nA' U B' = S.\nA' ∩ B' = (x{1/4}) U (x{2/4}) U (x{3/4}). This has 3 components.\nFor an arbitrary n, we can get n-1 components.\nSo the answer can be any finite number. Is there an upper bound? The question asks for the *largest* number. This implies there is no finite bound, so the answer is infinity.\n\nLet's construct an infinite case.\nLet C_n be the circle centered at (1/n, 1/2) with radius 1/(2n(n+1)). These are disjoint disks.\nLet A be the union of all C_n for n even, plus the point (0, 1/2), and line segments connecting the circles to (0, 1/2).\nLet B be the union of all C_n for n odd, plus the point (0, 1/2), and line segments.\nThis doesn't work.\n\nLet's go back to the horizontal strips.\nLet A_n = U_{k=1 to n} x [ (2k-2)/(2n), (2k-1)/(2n) ]. This is a set of n disjoint strips.\nLet B_n = U_{k=1 to n} x [ (2k-1)/(2n), 2k/(2n) ]. This is also n disjoint strips.\nA_n U B_n = S.\nLet A = A_n U ({0} x). A is connected.\nLet B = B_n U ({1} x). B is connected.\nA and B are closed. A U B = S.\nA ∩ B = U_{k=1 to 2n-1} x {k/(2n)}. This has 2n-1 components.\nSince n can be arbitrarily large, the number of components can be arbitrarily large.\n\nSo there is no finite maximum. The answer is infinity.\nLet's verify the construction for arbitrary N.\nLet N be the desired number of components.\nLet A = (U_{k=0 to N} x [ (2k)/(2N+2), (2k+1)/(2N+2) ]) U ({0}x).\nLet B = (U_{k=0 to N} x [ (2k+1)/(2N+2), (2k+2)/(2N+2) ]) U ({1}x).\nLet's adjust the indices.\nLet the horizontal dividing lines be y_i = i/(N+1) for i = 1, ..., N.\nLet S_i = x [y_i, y_{i+1}] for i=0 to N, with y_0=0, y_{N+1}=1.\nLet A = (U_{k even} S_k) U ({0}x).\nLet B = (U_{k odd} S_k) U ({1}x).\nA and B are closed. Their union is S.\nA is connected: each even strip S_k touches the left vertical line {0}x.\nB is connected: each odd strip S_k touches the right vertical line {1}x.\nThe intersection A ∩ B is the union of the horizontal lines y_i for i=1, ..., N.\nA ∩ B = U_{i=1 to N} x {i/(N+1)}.\nThis is a set of N disjoint horizontal line segments. Each is a connected component.\nSo the intersection has N components.\nSince we can do this for any N, there is no largest finite number.\n\nThe question is \"What is the largest number...\". If there is no finite bound, the answer is typically considered to be infinity. In the context of such questions, \"number\" can mean cardinality. The set of components would be countably infinite.\n\nLet's refine the infinite case.\nLet C be the Cantor set on the y-axis. C is closed, totally disconnected.\nLet A = [0, 1/2] x. Let B = [1/2, 1] x. Intersection is {1/2}x. Connected.\n\nLet A = { (x,y) in S | x <= 1/2 } U U_{y in C} [1/2, 1] x {y}.\nA is closed and connected.\nLet B = cl(S \\ A). B is connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = ({1/2}x) U U_{y in C} [1/2, 1] x {y}. This is connected.\n\nLet's go back to the simple construction that gives N components.\nLet N be any positive integer.\nLet A = U_{k=1..N+1, k is odd} x [(k-1)/(N+1), k/(N+1)] U {0}x\nLet B = U_{k=1..N+1, k is even} x [(k-1)/(N+1), k/(N+1)] U {1}x\nLet's check for N=2. We want 2 components.\nLines at y=1/3, y=2/3.\nStrips are S1=x[0,1/3], S2=x[1/3,2/3], S3=x[2/3,1].\nA = S1 U S3 U {0}x. Connected.\nB = S2 U {1}x. Connected.\nA U B = S.\nA ∩ B = (x{1/3}) U (x{2/3}). This has 2 components.\nSo for any N, we can construct an intersection with N components.\n\nTherefore, there is no largest finite number of components. The number can be any finite integer N.\nThe question asks for the \"largest number\". This implies that either there is a finite upper bound, or the answer is infinity. My construction shows there is no finite upper bound.\n\nFinal check of the question wording: \"What is the largest number of components...\". This is a standard way of asking for the supremum of the possible numbers of components. Since the set of possible numbers of components is {1, 2, 3, ...}, the supremum is infinity.\n\nLet's consider if there's any subtlety I'm missing.\n- Closed sets: My construction uses unions of closed sets, so the resulting sets A and B are closed.\n- Connected sets: My construction explicitly ensures A and B are connected by adding a \"backbone\" segment.\n- Union is the unit square: My construction partitions the square into strips and assigns each strip to either A or B (with boundaries overlapping), and the backbones are also included, so the union is the whole square.\n- Intersection components: The intersection is a set of disjoint horizontal lines, the number of which can be chosen arbitrarily.\n\nThe construction seems sound. The number of components can be any positive integer. Therefore, there is no largest integer, and the answer must be infinity.There is no finite maximum for the number of components of the intersection of two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square. We can construct examples with any finite number of components.\n\n### Construction for an Arbitrary Number of Components\n\nLet the unit square be denoted by `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`. We want to find two closed, connected sets, `A` and `B`, such that `A U B = S` and their intersection `A ∩ B` has a specified number of connected components, say `n`.\n\nLet `n` be any positive integer. We can construct the sets `A` and `B` as follows:\n\n1.  **Partition the square into horizontal strips.**\n    Divide the unit square into `2n - 1` horizontal strips of equal height. Let the horizontal lines that form these strips be `y = k / (2n - 1)` for `k = 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2`.\n\n2.  **Define the sets A and B based on these strips.**\n    *   Let set `A` be the union of the \"odd\" numbered strips (the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) and the left edge of the square.\n    *   Let set `B` be the union of the \"even\" numbered strips (the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) and the right edge of the square.\n\n    More formally:\n    *   Let `A_strips = U_{i=1 to n} [0, 1] x [(2i - 2)/(2n - 1), (2i - 1)/(2n - 1)]`\n    *   Let `B_strips = U_{i=1 to n-1} [0, 1] x [(2i - 1)/(2n - 1), 2i/(2n - 1)]`\n\n    Now, define `A` and `B`:\n    *   `A = A_strips U ({0} x [0, 1])`\n    *   `B = B_strips U ({1} x [0, 1])`\n\n3.  **Verify the properties of A and B.**\n    *   **Closed:** `A` and `B` are unions of closed sets (closed rectangles and line segments), so they are closed.\n    *   **Connected:**\n        *   Each strip in `A_strips` is connected and touches the vertical line segment `{0} x [0, 1]`. Since the union of connected sets with a non-empty intersection is connected, `A` is connected.\n        *   Similarly, each strip in `B_strips` is connected and touches the vertical line segment `{1} x [0, 1]`, making `B` connected.\n    *   **Union is the unit square:** The union of all the strips, `A_strips U B_strips`, covers the entire square. Since `A` and `B` contain these strips, their union `A U B` is the unit square `S`.\n\n4.  **Determine the intersection A ∩ B.**\n    The intersection of `A` and `B` consists of the horizontal lines that separate the strips.\n    `A ∩ B = U_{k=1 to 2n-2} [0, 1] x {k / (2n - 1)}`\n\n    This intersection is the union of `2n - 2` disjoint horizontal line segments. Each of these segments is a connected component. For instance, if we want to have `N` components, we can set `2n - 2 = N`.\n\n### Example for 4 Components\nLet's choose `n=3`. This will give `2*3 - 2 = 4` components.\n*   `A` consists of the strips `[0,1]x[0,1/5]`, `[0,1]x[2/5,3/5]`, `[0,1]x[4/5,1]` and the left edge `{0}x[0,1]`.\n*   `B` consists of the strips `[0,1]x[1/5,2/5]`, `[0,1]x[3/5,4/5]` and the right edge `{1}x[0,1]`.\n\nThe intersection `A ∩ B` is the set of horizontal lines:\n`([0,1]x{1/5}) U ([0,1]x{2/5}) U ([0,1]x{3/5}) U ([0,1]x{4/5})`\nThis intersection has 4 connected components.\n\nSince we can construct an example with any arbitrary positive integer number of components `N`, there is no largest finite number of components.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of components is infinite.\n\n<<<∞>>>"
