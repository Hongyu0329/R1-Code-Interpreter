**Korean** and **Tamil** are two languages from different Asian cultures (East Asian and South Asian) with no direct historical contact. In both languages, the informal words for "mom" (**Eomma** in Korean and **Amma** in Tamil) and "dad" (**Appa** in both Korean and Tamil) are nearly identical. However, their words for "broom" (**bitjaru** in Korean and **thudaippam** in Tamil) are not similar.
