    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is not a character who has visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices, but rather the backstory of the character **Hall-Sun** that contains allusions to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe narrative reveals that Hall-Sun, the foster-daughter of the protagonist Thiodolf, was discovered as a baby in the wilderness. A significant detail in her history is her association with a she-wolf. The text describes her as a \"wild-wood waif\" who was found clad in linen, and a \"she-wolf great and grisly\" was with her. Hall-Sun recalls playing with the she-wolf without fear, which mirrors the iconic imagery of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\nFurthermore, the name of the Germanic tribe at the center of the story, the Wolfings, and their banner bearing the image of a wolf, reinforces this thematic connection. While a former thrall of the Romans does recount some of their customs, the most direct and recognizable reference to the Romulus and Remus legend lies within the origin story of the Hall-Sun.\n\n<<<Hall-Sun>>>"
