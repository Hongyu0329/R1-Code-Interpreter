    "I am unable to determine the exact number of sissone fermes Svetlana Zakharova performed in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's \"Swan Lake\" choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich.\n\nMy search for a publicly available video of this specific performance has been unsuccessful. While the existence of this production, and a recording of it, is confirmed through numerous reviews, trailers, and listings for DVD and streaming services, all links to freely accessible full-length or partial videos of the performance are no longer active.\n\nThe performance is noted to have occurred on January 25, 2014, and was also screened in cinemas in 2015. It is available on platforms such as Amazon Prime Video and Marquee TV, as well as on a BelAir Classiques DVD. However, without access to these paid resources, a precise count of the choreographic elements is not possible.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question.>>>"
