    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is 487,644,161,389,533,633,380,165.\n\nAn involution is an element of a group that is its own inverse. To find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997), we first consider its parent group, the special unitary group SU(4, 997). The involutions in PSU(4, 997) are images of elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g` squared is in the center of SU(4, 997), but `g` itself is not in the center.\n\nThe center of SU(4, 997) consists of the matrices {I, -I}, where I is the identity matrix. This is because the order of the center is the greatest common divisor of 4 and 997+1, which is `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n\nThe condition on `g` thus becomes `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`, with `g` not being I or -I. It can be shown that for `q = 997`, which satisfies `q â‰¡ 1 (mod 4)`, there are no elements `g` in SU(4, q) such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\nTherefore, we only need to count the elements `g` in SU(4, 997) where `g^2 = I` and `g` is not the identity or its negative. These are involutions whose eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 has a dimension of 2 (this is required for the determinant to be 1). These elements form a single conjugacy class in SU(4, 997).\n\nThe number of such elements is given by the formula:\n\n`N = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n\nwhere `q = 997`.\n\nSince the center of SU(4, 997) has two elements, the projection from SU(4, 997) to PSU(4, 997) is a 2-to-1 mapping. Thus, the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is half the number of these elements in SU(4, 997).\n\nNumber of involutions in PSU(4, 997) = `(1/2) * q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`:\n*   `q^4 = 997^4 = 988,053,848,081`\n*   `q^2 - q + 1 = 997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994,009 - 997 + 1 = 993,013`\n*   `q^2 + 1 = 997^2 + 1 = 994,009 + 1 = 994,010`\n\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * 988,053,848,081 * 993,013 * 994,010`\n= `487,644,161,389,533,633,380,165`\n\n<<<487644161389533633380165>>>"
