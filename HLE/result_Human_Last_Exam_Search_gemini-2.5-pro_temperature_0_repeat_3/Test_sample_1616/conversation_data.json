    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change process in English where a tense vowel (a long vowel or diphthong) becomes a lax (short) vowel when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word. This typically occurs when a suffix is added.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n*   **serenity**: This word is derived from *serene*. The addition of the suffix *-ity* shifts the stress, and the tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity* (/səˈrɛn.ə.ti/). This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **derivative**: This word is related to *derive*. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in *derive* changes to the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative* (/dɪˈrɪv.ə.tɪv/). This also exemplifies trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **gratitude**: This word comes from the Latin *grātus*, which had a long (tense) 'a'. In the English word *gratitude* (/ˈɡræt.ɪ.tjuːd/), the vowel in the first syllable (which is the third from the end) is the lax vowel /æ/. This follows the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **southern**: This two-syllable word comes from Old English *sūþerne*. While the vowel shortens from the /aʊ/ in *south* to the /ʌ/ in *southern*, this is not due to trisyllabic laxing because the word is not trisyllabic. Historically, the word was trisyllabic (*southerne*), which allowed the laxing to occur before later sound changes made it disyllabic. However, in the context of a synchronic analysis of Modern English word pairs, it doesn't fit the \"trisyllabic\" part of the rule.\n*   **pleasant**: This two-syllable word is derived from Old French *plaisant* and is related to *please*. The vowel change from the tense /iː/ in *please* to the lax /ɛ/ in *pleasant* is an example of a different kind of vowel shortening, not trisyllabic laxing, because the word has only two syllables.\n*   **shadow**: This word comes from the Old English *sceadwe*, an oblique form of *sceadu* (\"shade\"). It has always been a disyllabic word and is not formed by adding a suffix to a base word in a way that would trigger trisyllabic laxing. Its vowel sound developed independently of this rule.\n\nWhile `southern` and `pleasant` are disyllabic and therefore do not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing in their modern forms, they are part of derivational pairs that do show vowel laxing. `Shadow`, on the other hand, is a native English word whose phonological history does not involve this type of suffix-driven vowel alternation at all. It is etymologically related to \"shade,\" but the relationship is not one of suffixation that would trigger this specific rule. Therefore, `shadow` is the word that has most clearly not undergone the process of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
