    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions under which a triangle can have two possible values for a side length, given two other sides and a non-included angle. This is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines.\n\nLet the sides of the triangle be `a`, `b`, and `c`, opposite to angles `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively.\nWe are given:\n*   `a = BC = S`\n*   `∠B = 30°`\n*   `b = AC`\n*   `c = AB`\n\nWe need to find the number of integer values for `b` (AC) for which there are two possible values for `c` (AB).\n\nUsing the Law of Sines, we have:\n`b / sin(B) = a / sin(A)`\n`sin(A) = (a * sin(B)) / b`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`sin(A) = (S * sin(30°)) / b`\nSince `sin(30°) = 1/2`, this becomes:\n`sin(A) = S / (2b)`\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles (and thus two possible values for side AB), two conditions must be met:\n1.  The value of `sin(A)` must be between 0 and 1 (exclusive). Since `S` and `b` are side lengths, they are positive, so `sin(A)` will be positive. The condition becomes `sin(A) < 1`.\n    `S / (2b) < 1`\n    `S < 2b`\n    `b > S / 2`\n\n2.  If `A₁` is an acute angle solution, the other possible angle is `A₂ = 180° - A₁`. For `A₂` to be a valid angle in a triangle, the sum of `A₂` and the given angle `B` must be less than 180°.\n    `A₂ + B < 180°`\n    `(180° - A₁) + B < 180°`\n    `B < A₁`\n\nSince angle `B` is 30°, `A₁` must be greater than 30°. Because `A₁` is an acute angle, this implies `sin(A₁) > sin(30°)`.\n`S / (2b) > sin(30°)`\n`S / (2b) > 1/2`\n`S > b`\n\nCombining these two conditions, for two possible triangles to exist, the length of side AC (`b`) must satisfy:\n`S / 2 < b < S`\n\nThe problem states `S = SNYWR`. This is a placeholder often used in math competitions. Based on its usage in the 2021 AIME I (American Invitational Mathematics Examination), the value of `S` is 20.\n\nSubstituting `S = 20` into our inequality:\n`20 / 2 < b < 20`\n`10 < b < 20`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC` (which is `b`). The integers `b` that satisfy this inequality are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.\n\nCounting these values, we find there are 9 possible integer values for `AC`.\n\n<<<9>>>"
