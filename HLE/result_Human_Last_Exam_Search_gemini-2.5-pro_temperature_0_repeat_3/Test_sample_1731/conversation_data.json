    "### Equilibrium Properties of Light Quanta via Large Deviation Theory\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, i.e., a photon gas, can be determined using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding the statistical properties of systems with many particles, such as a photon gas, and reproduce the well-established results of Bose and Planck.\n\nAt the heart of this approach lies the idea that the macroscopic equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the most probable microscopic configuration. Large deviation theory quantifies the probability of fluctuations away from this most probable state.\n\n**Application of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff Theorems:**\n\nThe **Boltzmann-Sanov theorem** is applied to the distribution of photons in phase space. It states that the probability of observing a macroscopic distribution of particles that deviates from the equilibrium distribution is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the observed and equilibrium distributions. In the context of a photon gas, the equilibrium distribution is the one that maximizes the Boltzmann-Sanov entropy under the given physical constraints.\n\nThe **Cramer-Chernoff theorem** is used to analyze the fluctuations of the total energy of the photon gas. It provides a bound on the probability that the average energy of the system deviates significantly from its expected value. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Cramer-Chernoff large deviation function, which is related to the free energy of the system, reaches its minimum value.\n\nTo find the equilibrium values, one typically employs the method of Lagrange multipliers. The entropy, as given by the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, is maximized subject to the constraint of a fixed average total energy. This procedure naturally leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons, where the chemical potential is zero due to the non-conserved nature of photons in a black-body cavity.\n\n**Equilibrium Values for Entropy and Mean Energy:**\n\nThrough the application of these large deviation principles, the well-known expressions for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas in a volume *V* at a temperature *T* are recovered.\n\nThe **mean energy (U)** of the photon gas is found to be:\n<br>\n$U = \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3} V T^4$\n<br>\nwhere:\n- *k<sub>B</sub>* is the Boltzmann constant\n- *h* is the Planck constant\n- *c* is the speed of light\n\nThis demonstrates the characteristic T<sup>4</sup> dependence of the energy density of black-body radiation, also known as the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThe **entropy (S)** of the photon gas at equilibrium is given by:\n<br>\n$S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45h^3c^3} V T^3$\n<br>\nThis shows that the entropy of a photon gas is proportional to T<sup>3</sup>.\n\nIn summary, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide a powerful and rigorous foundation for deriving the thermodynamic properties of a photon gas, confirming the results originally obtained by Planck and Bose from a modern statistical perspective.\n\n<<<The equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas is proportional to T^4, and its entropy is proportional to T^3. The explicit expressions are $U = \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3} V T^4$ and $S = \\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45h^3c^3} V T^3$.>>>"
