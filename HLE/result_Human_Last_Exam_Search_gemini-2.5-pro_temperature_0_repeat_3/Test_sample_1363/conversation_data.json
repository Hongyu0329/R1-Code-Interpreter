    "In the European Tango, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the dance's core technique.\n\nThe fundamental characteristics of the Tango are distinct from the \"swing\" dances like the Waltz or Foxtrot. Tango technique is defined by its staccato action, the absence of rise and fall, and a strict \"no sway\" rule. A reverse turn in Tango is a sharp, rotational action with a precise amount of turn prescribed for each step. For example, a common Open Reverse Turn involves a total of 3/4 of a turn to the left, executed in specific increments over six steps.\n\nAn instructor in a demonstration video explains that if a leader were to overturn the second step of a reverse turn, it would rotate the couple into a completely different position known as a \"fallaway,\" which is a different figure entirely. This illustrates how exceeding the prescribed rotation violates the intended shape and definition of the turn.\n\nIn contrast, dances like the Quickstep and Slow Foxtrot often feature overturned figures as part of their advanced choreography. The technique of these swing dances, which includes body sway, allows for more flexibility in rotation. While a standard amount of turn is defined, overturning is a common stylistic choice used for floorcraft or to enter specific amalgamations, and is even included in the names of some syllabus figures like the \"Overturned Turning Lock\".\n\nTherefore, due to its rigid and staccato nature without sway, the European Tango's technique does not allow for the overturning of a reverse turn; doing so would fundamentally break the character and mechanics of the step.\n\n<<<C>>>"
