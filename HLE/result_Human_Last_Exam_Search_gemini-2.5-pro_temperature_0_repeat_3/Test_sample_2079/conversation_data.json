    "While the name of the specific individual who held the position of judge (Latin: *iudex*, Slovak: *richtár*) of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461 is not directly available in the provided search results, historical records confirm that the town did have a judge at that time. The town of Bardejov, a free royal town since 1376, had the right to elect its own magistrate, which consisted of a judge and a town council.\n\nThe most definitive sources that contain the names of the judges of Bardejov during the 15th century are:\n\n*   **\"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\"** by Mária Fedorčáková. This book is noted for its comprehensive lists of judges and town council members based on the well-preserved medieval archives of Bardejov.\n*   **\"Bardejov v XV. storočí. Štúdie z dejín mesta\"** by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka, which includes a chapter specifically on the mayors of Bardejov in the 15th century.\n\nAlthough the search results confirm the existence of a judge in Bártfa in 1461 through mentions of correspondence with the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa\" regarding border robberies in that year, the name of the judge is not specified in the available documents.\n\nTherefore, while the exact name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 is recorded in historical archives, it is contained within specialized academic publications that are not fully accessible through online searches.\n\n<<<The name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 is not available in the searched online resources, but is likely recorded in the book \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by Mária Fedorčáková or \"Bardejov v XV. storočí. Štúdie z dejín mesta\" by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka.>>>"
