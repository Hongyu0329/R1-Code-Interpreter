    "When Glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG) is broken down or inhibited, it allows for increased macrophage engulfment of amyloid-β.\n\nGMFG is an actin-disassembly protein found in high concentrations in immune cells. Research has shown that reducing the amount of GMFG in mouse macrophages leads to an increase in their ability to phagocytose, or ingest, amyloid-β42, a key component of the amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, overexpressing GMFG in these cells diminishes their capacity to take up amyloid-β42.\n\nThe mechanism by which GMFG regulates amyloid phagocytosis is through its influence on a cell-surface receptor called scavenger receptor class A type I (SR-AI). When GMFG is knocked down, the expression of SR-AI on the macrophage surface increases, thereby enhancing the cell's ability to bind and engulf amyloid-β. This process is also linked to the modulation of SR-AI ubiquitination, which affects the receptor's stability and signaling.\n\nFurthermore, the breakdown of GMFG has been shown to increase the levels of the transcription factor MafB, which in turn boosts the expression of SR-AI. These findings suggest that GMFG is a significant regulator of macrophage-mediated amyloid-β clearance and could be a potential therapeutic target for diseases characterized by amyloid accumulation.\n\n<<<Glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG)>>>"
