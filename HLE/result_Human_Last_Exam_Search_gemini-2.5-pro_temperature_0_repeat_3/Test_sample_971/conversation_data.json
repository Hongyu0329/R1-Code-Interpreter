    "I am unable to determine the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008.\n\nWhile it is confirmed that Osipova performed this role in 2008 as a guest artist from the Bolshoi Ballet in Novosibirsk, and video footage of this performance exists online, a precise count of the pirouettes is not available in written sources. Reviews and analyses of her performance praise her remarkable turning ability and speed, with one article noting her \"dizzying series of revolutions,\" but none specify the exact number of pirouettes in the Act I variation.\n\nWithout the ability to analyze the video directly or find a source that provides a choreographic breakdown with the number of turns, a definitive answer cannot be provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question.>>>"
