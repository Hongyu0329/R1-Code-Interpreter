    "There are exactly **seven** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is defined as product-free if the product of any two elements in *S* (including an element with itself) is not an element of *S*. A product-free set is called maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their 2009 paper, \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". While their terminology uses \"sum-free,\" the definition they provide is equivalent to \"product-free\" in the context of general group theory. Their work identified a total of eleven groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 1 or 2. Four of these groups are for sets of size 1 (C₂, C₃, C₄, and Q₈), leaving seven distinct groups for sets of size 2.\n\nThe seven finite groups are:\n*   **C₅** (Cyclic group of order 5)\n*   **C₆** (Cyclic group of order 6)\n*   **C₈** (Cyclic group of order 8)\n*   **C₂ × C₂** (the Klein four-group)\n*   **D₆** (Dihedral group of order 6, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃)\n*   **D₈** (Dihedral group of order 8)\n*   **Q₁₂** (Dicyclic group of order 12, also known as the generalized quaternion group of order 12)\n\nThese groups are identified through a detailed case-by-case analysis in the work of Giudici and Hart, which considers properties such as the orders of elements in the set and the structure of the subgroup generated by the set.\n\n<<<7>>>"
