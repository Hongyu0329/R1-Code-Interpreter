    "The curve described by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t) is a type of graph known as a Lissajous curve. For a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, the number of self-intersection points can be determined by a specific formula, provided that 'a' and 'b' are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nThe formula for the number of self-intersection points is (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n\nIn this specific case, the parameters are a = 9 and b = 5. These two integers are coprime.\n\nBy applying the formula, the number of self-intersection points is calculated as follows:\n(9-1) * (5-1) / 2 = 8 * 4 / 2 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
