    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is expressed through a functional integral over all possible field configurations. This is formulated in Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate `t` is analytically continued to an imaginary time `τ = it`, which is periodic with period `β = 1/T`, where `T` is the temperature.\n\nThe partition function `Z` is given by:\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`\n\nHere, `Dϕ` represents the functional measure over the field configurations, and `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action for the scalar field. For a neutral scalar field with mass `m` and a potential `V(ϕ)`, the Euclidean action is:\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x [ 1/2 (∂_μϕ)² + 1/2 m²ϕ² + V(ϕ) ]`\nwhere `∂_μϕ ∂_μϕ = (∂_τϕ)² + (∇ϕ)²`.\n\nThe term in the action that is quadratic in the field `ϕ` can be expressed as an inner product. This part of the action describes the free (non-interacting) theory. We can write this quadratic part as:\n`S_E^(quadratic) = 1/2 ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) (-∂_μ∂^μ + m²) ϕ(τ, x)`\nafter an integration by parts and imposing periodic boundary conditions for the bosonic field `ϕ` in the imaginary time direction, `ϕ(0, x) = ϕ(β, x)`.\n\nIn this context, the operator `D_ϕ` is the differential operator acting on the field `ϕ` in the quadratic part of the action:\n`D_ϕ = -∂_μ∂^μ + m² = - (∂_τ² + ∇²) + m²`\n\nThe inner product of two functions, say `f(x)` and `g(x)`, on this Euclidean spacetime is defined as:\n`(f, g) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x f(τ, x) g(τ, x)`\n\nTherefore, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is given by:\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [- (∂_τ² + ∇²) + m²] ϕ(τ, x)`\n\nThis expression is equivalent to twice the quadratic part of the Euclidean action, `2 * S_E^(quadratic)`, after performing an integration by parts on the derivative terms. The term appearing in the exponential of the partition function for a free field is `-1/2 (ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of the field `ϕ` multiplied by the action of the kinetic operator `D_ϕ` on `ϕ` over the Euclidean spacetime. Explicitly, it is:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_μ∂^μ + m²] ϕ(τ, x)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `ϕ(τ, x)` is the neutral scalar field in Euclidean spacetime.\n*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.\n*   `τ` is the imaginary time, and `x` represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n*   `∂_μ∂^μ = ∂_τ² + ∇²` is the Euclidean Laplacian operator.\n\nThis inner product corresponds to twice the quadratic part of the Euclidean action for the free scalar field.>>>"
