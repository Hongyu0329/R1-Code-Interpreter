In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of the field `ϕ` multiplied by the action of the kinetic operator `D_ϕ` on `ϕ` over the Euclidean spacetime. Explicitly, it is:

`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_μ∂^μ + m²] ϕ(τ, x)`

where:
*   `ϕ(τ, x)` is the neutral scalar field in Euclidean spacetime.
*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.
*   `τ` is the imaginary time, and `x` represents the spatial coordinates.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.
*   `∂_μ∂^μ = ∂_τ² + ∇²` is the Euclidean Laplacian operator.

This inner product corresponds to twice the quadratic part of the Euclidean action for the free scalar field.
