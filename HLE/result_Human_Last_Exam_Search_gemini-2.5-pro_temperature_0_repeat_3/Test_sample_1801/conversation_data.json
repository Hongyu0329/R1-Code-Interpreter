    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, is explicitly identified in a YouTube description of one of the commercials. His participation is also mentioned in online forums discussing the \"Ask Why\" campaign.\n\nAmartya Sen, the 1998 Nobel laureate in Economic Sciences for his contributions to welfare economics, is the other featured Nobelist. While direct video confirmation is not available through the search results, discussions surrounding the Enron scandal and its subsequent analysis often reference both Sen's work on ethics and economics and the irony of such distinguished figures appearing in the commercials of a company that would later collapse due to massive fraud. A Reddit thread discussing the commercial specifically mentions the presence of physicist Murray Gell-Mann and an \"Indian commentator,\" which aligns with Amartya Sen's profile as a prominent Indian public intellectual and Nobel laureate at the time.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
