Without a direct audio analysis or a musical transcription of this specific passage, it is impossible to definitively name the scale. However, based on Erroll Garner's well-documented style, the melody is most likely built around a **blues scale with significant chromatic embellishment and chordal textures**, rather than a simple diatonic or pentatonic scale.
