    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is a crucial element in perturbative calculations, representing the order of the diagram's automorphism group. It corrects for overcounting identical contributions arising from the permutations of internal lines and vertices. For a diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (propagators) in a perturbative expansion, several topologies are possible, typically considered within the context of $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\nThe description \"two vertices and four field contractions\" most commonly refers to one of the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams, as these diagrams are composed entirely of internal lines (contractions) connecting the vertices. The two most frequently discussed topologies are:\n\n1.  **The \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram:** This diagram consists of two vertices, each with a single loop (a propagator starting and ending at the same vertex), and two propagators connecting the two vertices.\n2.  **The \"Double-Scoop\" Diagram:** This diagram features two vertices connected directly by four distinct propagators.\n\nWhile the question is ambiguous without a specific diagram, the \"figure-eight\" diagram is a very common example used in textbooks and problem sets. For this diagram, the symmetry factor arises from several possible permutations that leave the diagram's structure unchanged:\n*   The two propagators connecting the vertices can be interchanged.\n*   The two vertices themselves can be swapped.\n*   The two field lines forming each loop can be exchanged.\n\nDifferent methods of counting these symmetries can lead to confusion. However, multiple sources, including university physics course materials, state that the symmetry factor for the figure-eight vacuum diagram is 8.\n\nFor the \"double-scoop\" diagram, the symmetry factor is calculated by considering the permutation of the four identical propagators (4!) and the permutation of the two identical vertices (2!). This results in a symmetry factor of $4! \\times 2 = 48$.\n\nGiven its frequent use as a canonical example, the \"figure-eight\" diagram is the most probable intended subject of the question.\n\n<<<8>>>"
