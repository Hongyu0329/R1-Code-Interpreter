    "The minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. Its convex hull, which is the smallest convex shape that contains it, is a regular icosahedron. The vertices of the great icosahedron are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Its faces are equilateral triangles. Therefore, the outer hull of the great icosahedron is already a triangulated surface composed of these 20 triangles. The number of visible triangles from the outside is simply the number of faces of this convex hull.\n\n<<<20>>>"
