    "The minimal grid number for a knot is the size of the smallest square grid (n x n) on which the knot can be represented. This is also known as the knot's arc index. For an alternating knot, the arc index is its minimal crossing number plus two. The trefoil knot is an alternating knot with a minimal crossing number of 3, so its minimal grid number is 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, we are looking for the number of distinct 5x5 grid diagrams.\n\nAccording to research on the configuration space of grid diagrams, for a grid number of 5 (GN=5), there are a total of 10 distinct diagrams that form the trefoil knot. These papers note that this is the minimal grid number where non-trivial knots first appear.\n\nThe trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image. It exists in two forms: the left-hand trefoil and the right-hand trefoil. The 10 minimal grid diagrams are split between these two forms. One study includes a figure showing all 5 minimal grid diagrams for the right-hand trefoil knot. Consequently, the other 5 diagrams must represent the left-hand trefoil knot. These counts are given up to equivalences such as translation and rotation.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand trefoil knot has 5 minimal grid diagrams, up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
