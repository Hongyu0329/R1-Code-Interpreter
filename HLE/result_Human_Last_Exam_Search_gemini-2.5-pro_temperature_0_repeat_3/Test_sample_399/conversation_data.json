    "To solve the initial value problem, we first identify the differential equation and then find its general solution. After that, we use the initial condition to determine the particular solution and, finally, evaluate it at the desired point.\n\n**1. Identify and separate the variables:**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$\n\nThis can be written as:\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can separate the variables by moving all terms involving *x* to one side and all terms involving *t* to the other side:\n$\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$\n\n**2. Integrate both sides:**\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n$\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt$\n\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ is $-\\frac{1}{x}$. The integral of $(t-1)$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\nSo, the integration yields:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$\nwhere *C* is the constant of integration.\n\n**3. Apply the initial condition:**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation to solve for *C*.\n$-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$\n$\\frac{1}{8} = C$\n\n**4. Find the particular solution:**\nNow, we substitute the value of *C* back into the integrated equation:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTo find the explicit solution for $x(t)$, we can first get a common denominator on the right side:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{4t^2 - 8t + 1}{8}$\n\nNow, we solve for $x(t)$:\n$\\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{4t^2 - 8t + 1}{8}$\n$x(t) = \\frac{-8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1} = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}$\n\n**5. Calculate x(1):**\nFinally, we substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find $x(1)$:\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1)^2 + 8(1) - 1}$\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4 + 8 - 1}$\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
