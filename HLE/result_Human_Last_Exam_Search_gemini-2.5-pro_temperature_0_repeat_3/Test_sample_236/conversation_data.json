    "A total of six distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with four or fewer crossings.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how these elements are generated:\n\n1.  **Knots and Surgeries Considered:** The knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). For an integral Dehn surgery on a knot to produce a homology 3-sphere, the surgery coefficient must be either +1 or -1.\n\n2.  **The Trivial Element from the Unknot:** Performing a +1 or -1 surgery on the unknot results in the 3-sphere (S³), which represents the trivial element (the identity) in the homology cobordism group.\n\n3.  **Elements from the Trefoil Knot (3₁):** The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image.\n    *   **The Poincaré Homology Sphere:** Performing a -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil (or, equivalently, a +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil) yields the Poincaré homology sphere. This manifold represents a non-trivial element of order two in the homology cobordism group. Its Rokhlin invariant is 1, which distinguishes it from the trivial element.\n    *   **An Element of Infinite Order:** A +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil produces a different homology sphere, the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7). This element is of infinite order in the homology cobordism group. Its inverse is generated by a -1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil.\n\n4.  **Elements from the Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n    *   **Another Element of Infinite Order:** A +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot results in a homology sphere that generates another subgroup of infinite order. Its inverse is obtained through a -1 surgery on the same knot.\n\n5.  **Counting the Distinct Elements:** This process yields a set of six distinct elements:\n    *   The **trivial element** from the unknot.\n    *   The **Poincaré sphere** from the trefoil knot (an element of order two).\n    *   An **infinite-order element** from +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil.\n    *   The **inverse** of the element above.\n    *   An **infinite-order element** from +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n    *   The **inverse** of the element above.\n\nThese elements are all distinct from one another. The trivial element is unique. The Poincaré sphere is the only element of order two. The remaining four elements are of infinite order and can be distinguished from each other using more advanced invariants, such as the Casson invariant or the Fintushel-Stern μ-invariant, which take on different values for each of these homology spheres.\n\n<<<6>>>"
