    "To date, 10 mature members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans. These are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202.\n\nThese mature microRNAs originate from a larger number of precursor genes or genomic loci. Different sources report slight variations in the number of these precursors, with some stating there are 12 or 13. For instance, one source specifies that the 10 mature let-7 miRNAs are derived from 13 precursor genes. Another indicates they come from 12 different genomic loci. The let-7 family is highly conserved across many species and plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression.\n\n<<<10>>>"
