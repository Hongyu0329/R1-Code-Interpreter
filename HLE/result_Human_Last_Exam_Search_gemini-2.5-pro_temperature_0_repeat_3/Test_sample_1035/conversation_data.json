    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35. This is a well-known problem in graph theory.\n\nA key result, established by Graham and Pollak, and later refined by Tichy, states that the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs needed to cover the edges of \\( K_n \\) is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). The construction that achieves this bound also provides the answer to the question about the minimum total number of vertices.\n\nThe construction is as follows:\n1.  Let \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). Since \\( 2^k \\ge n \\), we can assign a unique binary vector of length \\( k \\) to each of the \\( n \\) vertices of \\( K_n \\).\n2.  For each of the \\( k \\) positions in the binary vectors, we define a bipartite graph \\( G_i \\) (for \\( i = 1, \\dots, k \\)).\n3.  The vertex set of each \\( G_i \\) is the same as the vertex set of \\( K_n \\).\n4.  For each graph \\( G_i \\), we partition the vertices into two sets: those with a '0' in the \\( i \\)-th position of their binary vector, and those with a '1'. The graph \\( G_i \\) is the complete bipartite graph between these two sets.\n5.  Any two distinct vertices in \\( K_n \\) will have different binary vectors, meaning their vectors must differ in at least one position, say the \\( j \\)-th position. This ensures that the edge connecting these two vertices is included in the bipartite graph \\( G_j \\).\n6.  This family of \\( k \\) bipartite graphs therefore covers all the edges of \\( K_n \\).\n\nEach of the \\( k \\) bipartite graphs in this construction has \\( n \\) vertices. Therefore, the total number of vertices in this family of graphs is \\( n \\times k = n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). It has been proven that this is the minimum possible total number of vertices.\n\nFor the specific case of \\( n = 35 \\):\n*   We need to calculate \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\n*   We know that \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\).\n*   Since \\( 32 < 35 < 64 \\), we have \\( 5 < \\log_2 35 < 6 \\).\n*   Therefore, \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 \\).\n\nThe minimum number of vertices is \\( 35 \\times 6 = 210 \\).\n\n<<<210>>>"
