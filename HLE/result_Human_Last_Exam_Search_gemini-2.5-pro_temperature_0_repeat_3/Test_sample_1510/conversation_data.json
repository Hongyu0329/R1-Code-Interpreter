    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry elements. Each wallpaper group is associated with a crystallographic point group, which describes the symmetries that leave a single point fixed, such as rotations and reflections. The order of a group refers to the number of symmetry operations it contains.\n\nThe crystallographic point groups of order 2 are C₂ and D₁.\n*   The point group C₂ contains a single two-fold rotation (a 180-degree rotation). The wallpaper group that has C₂ as its point group is **p2**.\n*   The point group D₁ contains a single reflection. Three wallpaper groups have the point group D₁: **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**. In the case of the `pg` group, the symmetry operation in the pattern is a glide reflection (a reflection followed by a translation). However, when determining the point group, the translational component is disregarded, leaving only the reflection operation.\n\nTherefore, the four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
