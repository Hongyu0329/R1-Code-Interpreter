    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score, as measured by the proportion of variance it explains (R²), is theoretically capped by the SNP heritability of the phenotype. SNP heritability (h²_snp) represents the total proportion of phenotypic variation that can be accounted for by all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A polygenic score is constructed using the effect sizes of these SNPs as estimated from a GWAS.\n\nIn an ideal scenario, where the SNP effect sizes are estimated without any error and the prediction is performed on a perfectly comparable sample, the variance explained by the polygenic score could, in theory, equal the SNP heritability. However, in practice, the predictive power of polygenic scores is almost always lower than the SNP heritability. This discrepancy arises from several factors:\n\n*   **Estimation Errors:** The effect sizes of SNPs obtained from GWAS are estimates and contain statistical noise.\n*   **Sample Differences:** The genetic ancestry and environmental exposures can differ between the initial GWAS population (base data) and the population in which the score is being tested (target data).\n*   **Incomplete Capture of Heritability:** Current polygenic scores do not capture all of the SNP heritability, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as part of the \"missing heritability\" gap. For instance, for ADHD, the SNP heritability is estimated at 21.6%, while the best polygenic scores explain only about 5.5% of the variance.\n\nWhile some studies have reported rare instances where the variance explained by a polygenic score in a specific sample can exceed the *estimated* SNP heritability due to complexities like heterogeneity between different study cohorts, the SNP heritability remains the established theoretical upper limit for the predictive power of a polygenic score derived from those SNPs. Therefore, the predictive ability is necessarily lower than or, at its absolute maximum, equal to the true SNP heritability.\n\n<<<True>>>"
