    "**\"An American in Paris,\" the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, was the first film in that category to feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk.**\n\nThe iconic Parisian landmark appears during the film's celebrated 17-minute ballet sequence. This elaborate finale, choreographed by and starring Gene Kelly, presents a stylized and romanticized vision of Paris. One of the key settings in this dream-like ballet is the Place de la Concorde, the actual location of the Luxor Obelisk.\n\nWithin the ballet, the Place de la Concorde is brought to life through a set designed in the style of French Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy. A model of the fountain from the Place de la Concorde was created for the production to help plan the intricate choreography and camera work. Film historian analysis of the ballet sequence explicitly notes the presence of a \"two-dimentional obelisk\" on the set, confirming the landmark's inclusion in the film's artistic representation of the famous square.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners were also filmed in Paris, such as \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956) and \"Gigi\" (1958), evidence points to \"An American in Paris\" as the first to showcase the historic obelisk. The film's creative and artistic interpretation of Paris in its final ballet sequence firmly establishes its place as the answer.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
