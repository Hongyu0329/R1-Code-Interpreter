    "The value computed between heartbeats, derived from beat-to-beat intervals captured via PPG, is called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terminology:\n*   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** This is the general term for the time elapsed between two consecutive heartbeats. It is the fundamental measurement used to calculate heart rate variability.\n*   **RR Interval:** This term specifically refers to the interval between two successive R-waves (the prominent peaks) in an Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. While ECG is considered the gold standard for HRV measurement, the term RR interval is often used interchangeably with IBI in the context of HRV.\n*   **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI) or Peak-to-Peak Interval:** When using PPG, which measures the pulse wave in the blood vessels, the time between consecutive pulse wave peaks is sometimes called the Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI) or Peak-to-Peak interval. However, IBI is also a correct and widely used term for PPG-derived data.\n\nIn summary, while there are specific terms depending on the measurement technology (RR for ECG, PPI for PPG), **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** is the most accurate and commonly used term for the value between heartbeats used to compute HRV from PPG data.\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
