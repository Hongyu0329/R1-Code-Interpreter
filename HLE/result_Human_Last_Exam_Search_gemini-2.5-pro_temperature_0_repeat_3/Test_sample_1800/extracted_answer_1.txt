The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is reaction-dependent. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal range is typically 7-15 wt% Ni. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a 1:2 Ni/Ce molar ratio being optimal for HER and a 3:1 Ni/Ce atomic ratio being favorable for OER.
