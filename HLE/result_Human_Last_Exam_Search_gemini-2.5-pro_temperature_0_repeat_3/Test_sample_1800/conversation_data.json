    "### Unraveling the Optimal Nickel-Ceria Composition for Catalytic Reactions\n\nThe ideal ratio of nickel to cerium in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles, crucial for maximizing catalytic performance, is highly dependent on the specific chemical reaction, with distinct optimal compositions for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting.\n\nFor the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, a process important for producing high-purity hydrogen, research indicates that the optimal nickel content can vary. In studies on Ni/CeO2 catalysts, nickel loadings between 10 and 12.5 wt% have demonstrated high and nearly identical carbon monoxide conversion rates at temperatures between 300-450 Â°C. Another study focusing on CO oxidation suggests that 15 wt% NiO/CeO2 provides a stable and active catalyst, while higher concentrations can lead to deactivation. When other elements are introduced, such as in La-doped Ceria for the reverse WGS reaction, an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar has been identified. Furthermore, for Ni-W-Ce mixed oxide catalysts, a composition of Ni_0.2_W_0.1_Ce_0.7_O_2_ was found to have the highest catalytic activity.\n\nIn the realm of **water splitting**, which encompasses both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the ideal Ni/Ce ratio also differs. For the **oxygen evolution reaction (OER)**, studies on Ni_y_Ce_100-y_O_x_ electrocatalysts have shown that compositions of Ni_75_Ce_25_O_x_ and Ni_50_Ce_50_O_x_ exhibit superior activity. This is supported by computational research on Ni-Ceria nanoparticles which points to a 3Ni/1Ce ratio (equivalent to Ni_75_Ce_25_) as having more favorable adsorption energy and better catalytic properties for water splitting.\n\nConversely, for the **hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)**, a different optimal ratio has been reported. Research on Ni_3_N-CeO_2_/NF nanoparticles identified that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (approximately Ni_33.3_Ce_66.7_) resulted in the best HER performance. Studies on co-doped systems, such as Ni and Fe in ceria, have utilized a 20 mol% total metal doping with a 1:1 ratio of Ni to Fe.\n\nIn summary, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes catalytic performance for both the WGS reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, optimal nickel concentrations are generally in the range of 7-15 wt%, depending on the specific catalyst formulation. For water splitting, a higher nickel content, specifically a 3:1 atomic ratio of Ni to Ce, appears to be favorable for the OER, while a lower nickel to cerium ratio of 1:2 is optimal for the HER.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is reaction-dependent. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal range is typically 7-15 wt% Ni. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a 1:2 Ni/Ce molar ratio being optimal for HER and a 3:1 Ni/Ce atomic ratio being favorable for OER.>>>"
