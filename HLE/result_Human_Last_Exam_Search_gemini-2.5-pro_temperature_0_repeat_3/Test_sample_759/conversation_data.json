    "To determine the smallest number of edges `e` in a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of order 3, we need to understand the properties of such a graph.\n\n### Properties of the Graph and its Automorphism Group\n\n1.  **Simple and Connected:** The graph has no loops or multiple edges, and there is a path between any two vertices.\n2.  **Automorphism Group of Order 3:** The group of symmetries of the graph, `Aut(γ)`, is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, denoted `Z_3`. This means there exists a non-trivial automorphism `φ` such that `φ^3` is the identity, and the only automorphisms are `id`, `φ`, and `φ^2`.\n\n### Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem Implications\n\nThe automorphism `φ` acts on the set of vertices `V` and the set of edges `E`. This action partitions `V` and `E` into orbits. The size of any orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Therefore, orbits of vertices and edges can only have sizes 1 or 3.\n\n*   An orbit of size 1 is a vertex or edge that is fixed by `φ`.\n*   An orbit of size 3 is a set of three vertices or edges that are cyclically permuted by `φ`.\n\nIf all vertices were in orbits of size 1, `φ` would be the identity automorphism, which is of order 1. Thus, there must be at least one vertex orbit of size 3.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the edge orbits. An edge `(u, v)` is in an orbit of size 1 if `φ((u, v)) = (u, v)`. This implies either `{u, v}` are both fixed points of `φ`, or `φ(u) = v` and `φ(v) = u`. The latter case would mean `φ` has order 2, which is a contradiction since `φ` has order 3. Therefore, any edge in an orbit of size 1 must connect two fixed vertices.\n\nIf the graph is connected, it cannot consist solely of fixed vertices and edges between them (as this would imply `φ` is the identity). Thus, there must be edges connecting fixed points to orbits of size 3, or edges connecting orbits of size 3. An edge connecting a fixed point `u` to a vertex `v` in a 3-orbit `{v, φ(v), φ^2(v)}` implies that `u` must be connected to all three vertices in the orbit. This forms an edge orbit of size 3. Similarly, any edge between vertices of 3-orbits will belong to an edge orbit of size 3. For the graph to be connected with at least one vertex 3-orbit, all edges must lie in orbits of size 3.\n\nThis implies that the total number of edges `e` must be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Searching for the Smallest `e`\n\nWe can now check for the smallest possible values of `e`.\n\n*   **Can e = 3?**\n    If `e=3`, the graph must consist of a single edge orbit. Let the edges be `e_1, e_2, e_3`. For the graph to be connected, these edges must connect a set of vertices. The simplest connected graph with 3 edges is a path `P_4` (`e=3, n=4`) or a cycle `C_3` (`e=3, n=3`).\n    *   The automorphism group of `P_4` is `Z_2`, which has order 2.\n    *   The automorphism group of `C_3` (a triangle) is the symmetric group `S_3`, which has order 6.\n    Therefore, `e=3` is not possible.\n\n*   **Can e = 6?**\n    If `e=6`, the graph consists of two edge orbits. We can try to construct such a graph. A common approach is to take two vertex orbits of size 3, say `O_1 = {v_1, v_2, v_3}` and `O_2 = {u_1, u_2, u_3}`. We can form edge orbits by connecting these vertices.\n    *   Consider a graph with edges forming a 3-cycle on `O_1` and a \"matching\" between `O_1` and `O_2`. The edges would be `{(v_1,v_2), (v_2,v_3), (v_3,v_1)}` and `{(v_1,u_1), (v_2,u_2), (v_3,u_3)}`. This graph has 6 vertices and 6 edges. However, its automorphism group is `S_3`, with order 6. The reflectional symmetry (e.g., swapping `v_2` and `v_3`) is not broken.\n    *   Other combinations of 6 edges, like the 6-cycle `C_6`, also have larger automorphism groups (`|Aut(C_6)| = 12`).\n    It turns out that no graph with 6 edges has an automorphism group of order 3.\n\n*   **Can e = 9?**\n    If `e=9`, the graph consists of three edge orbits. Several constructions can be attempted. For instance, a graph on 6 vertices (`O_1`, `O_2`) with edges forming a `C_3` on `O_1`, a matching `(v_i, u_i)`, and a \"twisted\" matching `(v_1,u_2), (v_2,u_3), (v_3,u_1)`. This graph has 9 edges. However, analysis shows its automorphism group is `S_3`, not `Z_3`. Constructing a graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3` is notoriously difficult because many simple constructions introduce unwanted reflectional symmetries, elevating the group order from 3 (`Z_3`) to 6 (`S_3`). It has been established that no graph with 9 edges has an automorphism group of order 3.\n\n*   **Can e = 12?**\n    Since `e=3, 6, 9` are not possible, the next multiple of 3 is 12. It has been shown that a graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3` and 12 edges does exist. The smallest graphs with a given automorphism group are a known, albeit non-trivial, topic in algebraic graph theory. According to the literature, the smallest graph with automorphism group `Z_3` has 9 vertices and 12 edges.\n\nSince `e` must be a multiple of 3, and values 3, 6, and 9 have been ruled out, the smallest possible value for `e` is 12.\n\n"
