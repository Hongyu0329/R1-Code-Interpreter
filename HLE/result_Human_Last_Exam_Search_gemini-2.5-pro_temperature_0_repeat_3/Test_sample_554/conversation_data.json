    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms on a molecule's hydrocarbon framework are replaced by fluorine atoms. The original nanocar, a molecule designed to resemble a car on a nanoscale, consists of a chassis and four fullerene wheels. The perfluorination would apply to this chassis structure.\n\nWhile various nanocar designs exist, a computational study of a flexible nanocar specifies its chassis has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. Based on this structure, replacing all 34 hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms would result in a perfluoronanocar containing 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
