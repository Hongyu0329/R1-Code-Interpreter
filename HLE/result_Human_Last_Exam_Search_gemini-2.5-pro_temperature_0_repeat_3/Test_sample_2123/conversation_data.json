    "The surname of the English poet is Gay.\n\nThis is a reference to a literary anecdote recounted by the Russian writer Yuri Olesha in his book \"No Day Without a Line\" (*Ни дня без строчки*). In the book, Olesha recalls a conversation with fellow writer Valentin Kataev. Kataev mentioned reading a Russian translation of a foreign novel in his youth where the wide, elegant boulevards of Vienna were described as \"геевы бульвары\" (\"geyevy boulevards\").\n\nKataev was initially puzzled by this unusual adjective. He later concluded that it was a clever, if obscure, neologism by the translator. The word \"геевы\" was likely derived from the surname of the 18th-century English poet John Gay. The translator may have used the poet's name to evoke a sense of pastoral elegance and charm, as Gay was famous for works like \"The Beggar's Opera.\" The word also creates a pun in Russian, as it sounds similar to the word \"гай\" (gai), which means a grove or copse, a fitting description for the tree-lined boulevards.\n\n<<<Gay>>>"
