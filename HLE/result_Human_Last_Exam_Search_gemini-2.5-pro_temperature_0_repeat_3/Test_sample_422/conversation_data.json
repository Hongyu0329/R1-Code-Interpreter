    "Given the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge and a world restricted to only two epistemic states—Knowledge and Belief—two significant problems emerge, independent of Gettier-style cases.\n\n<<<### 1. The Problem of Justification: Agrippa's Trilemma\n\nThe JTB account requires a belief to be \"justified,\" but it fails to define what constitutes valid justification. This omission gives rise to a classic epistemological challenge known as Agrippa's Trilemma, which questions how any belief can be fundamentally justified. When you justify a belief, you typically do so with other beliefs. But what justifies those beliefs? This leads to three problematic possibilities:\n\n*   **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justification goes on forever, which is psychologically impossible for a person to hold.\n*   **Circular Reasoning:** The chain of justification eventually loops back to support itself (e.g., A is true because of B, and B is true because of A), which is a logical fallacy.\n*   **Arbitrary Assumption:** The chain terminates with a foundational belief that is not itself justified.\n\nIn a system limited to only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" this third option, known as foundationalism, becomes especially problematic. If the entire structure of a particular piece of \"Knowledge\" rests on a foundational belief that lacks justification, then that foundational belief can only be classified as a mere \"Belief.\" This implies that all knowledge is ultimately built upon a foundation of unsupported belief, which undermines the distinction and supposed certainty of the \"Knowledge\" state.\n\n### 2. The Problem of Truth: The Requirement for Absolute Certainty\n\nThe JTB definition demands that for a belief to be knowledge, it must be absolutely and objectively true. This creates an impossibly high standard that conflicts with the fallible nature of human experience and empirical evidence. We can rarely, if ever, be 100% certain that a belief corresponds to absolute truth.\n\nConsider scientific knowledge. Theories are built on extensive evidence and are considered justified, but they are often provisional and subject to revision. For instance, Newtonian physics was once considered knowledge, but it was later shown to be an incomplete (and therefore not absolutely true) description of reality by Einstein's theories of relativity. According to a strict JTB definition, no one ever *knew* Newtonian physics; they merely had a very useful and justified, but ultimately false, belief.\n\nIn a world with only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" this strictness has severe consequences. Since we can almost never be completely certain that our belief is true, we can never definitively claim to be in a state of \"Knowledge.\" We would be perpetually confined to the state of \"Belief\" because of the possibility, however remote, that our belief might turn out to be false. This renders the category of \"Knowledge\" nearly empty and practically unattainable, which contradicts the way we understand and use the concept in our lives.>>>"
