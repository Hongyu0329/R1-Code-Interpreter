    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, followed by an analysis of its memory usage.\n\n### C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring the letter case.\n * It is designed to be highly memory-efficient by only storing one of the\n * two strings in a buffer.\n *\n * Input:\n * The first two lines of standard input each contain a string. The strings\n * are guaranteed to be of the same length, ranging from 1 to 100 characters,\n * and consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n *\n * Output:\n * - \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically less than the second.\n * - \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second.\n * - \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A buffer is required to store the first string because the input is on\n    // two separate lines, which prevents reading a character from each string\n    // simultaneously. The maximum length is 100, so a buffer of size 101 is\n    // needed for the characters and the null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // The call to scanf(\"%s\", ...) leaves a newline character ('\\n') in the\n    // input stream. We must consume it before reading the second string\n    // character by character with getchar().\n    getchar();\n\n    // A 'char' is used for the loop index because the maximum string length (100)\n    // fits within the range of a char type. This is more memory-efficient\n    // than using a larger type like 'int'.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // This variable will hold each character read from the second string.\n    char c2;\n\n    // Read the second string one character at a time until a newline or\n    // the end-of-file (EOF) is reached.\n    while ((c2 = getchar()) != '\\n' && c2 != EOF) {\n        // For each character from the second string, compare it with the\n        // corresponding character from the buffered first string (s1[i]).\n        // The tolower() function from <ctype.h> is used to ensure the\n        // comparison is case-insensitive.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)) {\n            puts(\"-1\"); // First string is smaller.\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)) {\n            puts(\"1\"); // First string is larger.\n            return 0;\n        }\n        // If the characters are equal, move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n    puts(\"0\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Analysis\n\nThe goal is to calculate the total memory in bytes used for the variables declared in the program. This is determined by the sum of the sizes of each variable, which can be found using the `sizeof` operator in C.\n\n1.  `char s1[101];`: This is an array to store the first string. Its size is `101 * sizeof(char)`, which is `101 * 1 = 101` bytes.\n2.  `char i = 0;`: This variable is used as an index to iterate through the first string. The maximum string length is 100, which safely fits in a `char`. Its size is `sizeof(char)`, which is `1` byte.\n3.  `char c2;`: This variable holds a single character from the second string as it's being read. Its size is `sizeof(char)`, which is `1` byte.\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables is the sum of these sizes:\n\nm = (size of `s1`) + (size of `i`) + (size of `c2`)\nm = 101 + 1 + 1\nm = 103 bytes\n\nThis solution is maximally memory-efficient because it avoids creating a buffer for the second string and uses the smallest possible data types for its auxiliary variables.\n\n<<<103>>>"
