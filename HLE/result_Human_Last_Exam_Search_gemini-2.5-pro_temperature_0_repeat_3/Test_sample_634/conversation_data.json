    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices:\n\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices.\n\n**Step 1: Divide P1 by P2**\n\nWe seek to find a quotient matrix Q and a remainder matrix R such that P1 = Q * P2 + R, where the degree of the remainder R is less than the degree of P2.\n\nLet's choose a quotient matrix Q = [[0, -s], [s^2, s^2]].\nNow, we compute Q * P2:\nQ * P2 = [[0, -s], [s^2, s^2]] * [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n= [[-s(-s - 1), -s * 1], [s^2 * s + s^2(-s - 1), s^2 * 1]]\n= [[s^2 + s, -s], [s^3 - s^3 - s^2, s^2]]\n= [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2, s^2]]\n\nNext, we find the remainder R = P1 - Q * P2:\nR = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] - [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2, s^2]]\n= [, [-1, 0]]\n\nThe remainder is R = [, [-1, 0]].\n\n**Step 2: Find the GCRD of P2 and R**\n\nAccording to the Euclidean algorithm, the GCRD of P1 and P2 is the same as the GCRD of P2 and R.\nGCRD(P1, P2) = GCRD(P2, R) = GCRD([[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]], [, [-1, 0]]).\n\nSince the remainder R is a constant matrix (degree 0), we can find the GCRD by performing column operations on the matrix [P2, R] to reduce it to the form [G, 0].\n\nLet M = [P2, R] = [[s, 0, 0, 0], [-s - 1, 1, -1, 0]]\n\n1.  Add the second column to the third column (C3 -> C3 + C2):\n    M' = [[s, 0, 0, 0], [-s - 1, 1, 0, 0]]\n\n2.  Add `s` times the second column to the first column (C1 -> C1 + s*C2):\n    M'' = [[s, 0, 0, 0], [-s - 1 + s*1, 1, 0, 0]]\n    M'' = [[s, 0, 0, 0], [-1, 1, 0, 0]]\n\nThe matrix is now in the form [G, 0], where G is the GCRD.\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor is:\nG = [[s, 0], [-1, 1]]\n\n<<<[[s, 0], [-1, 1]]>>>"
