The probability to draw a link \(y_{ij}\) between nodes i and j in a jointly exchangeable random graph is given by the expression \(P(y_{ij} = 1) = E_F \left[ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 f_F(u, v) \,du \,dv \right]\), where \(f_F\) is a random, symmetric, measurable function determined by a random measure F, and u and v are independent random variables from a uniform distribution on.
