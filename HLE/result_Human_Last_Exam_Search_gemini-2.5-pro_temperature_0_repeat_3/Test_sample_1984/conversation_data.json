    "To find the number of stable equilibrium points, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the given differential equation. The equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\nSet $x'(t) = 0$ to find the equilibrium points:\n$-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0$\n\nFactor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nFactor the quadratic expression:\n$-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0$\n\nThe equilibrium points are the solutions to this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of each equilibrium point. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. The stability can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x)$, at each equilibrium point.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$f'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n1.  For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n2.  For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method to determine the stability of this point. We can analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n    *   For a value of $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ is negative. This means that to the left of $x=1$, $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ moves away from 1.\n    *   For a value of $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ is negative. This means that to the right of $x=1$, $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ moves towards 1.\n\nSince solutions starting from one side of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is considered semi-stable.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. The number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\nThe problem asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
