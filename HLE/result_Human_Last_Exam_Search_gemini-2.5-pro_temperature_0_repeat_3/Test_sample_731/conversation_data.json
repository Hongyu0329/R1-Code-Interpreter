    "The search results did not directly answer the question about the number of power subgroups. They discuss \"power graphs\" and \"enhanced power graphs,\" which are related concepts but not the same as the set of power subgroups. The vertices of a power graph are the group elements, and edges connect elements where one is a power of the other. A power subgroup is a specific type of subgroup, H = G^k.\n\nMy initial derivation seems sound and doesn't rely on any complex theory that I might have misremembered. It's a direct calculation based on the group's presentation.\n\nLet's review the steps:\n1.  **Definition of Semidihedral Group SD_512**:\n    *   Order: 512 = 2^9. So n=9.\n    *   Presentation: G = <a, b | a^(2^(9-1)) = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^(2^(9-2) - 1)>\n    *   G = <a, b | a^256 = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^127>\n    *   Elements are of the form a^i and a^i*b.\n\n2.  **Definition of Power Subgroup**:\n    *   H is a power subgroup if H = G^k = {g^k | g âˆˆ G} for some integer k.\n\n3.  **Calculation for odd k**:\n    *   (a^i)^k = a^(ik). Since k is odd, gcd(k, 256) = 1. The set {a^(ik)} for i=0..255 is the entire subgroup <a>.\n    *   (a^i*b)^k = a^(i(64(k-1)+1)) * b. Since k is odd, 64(k-1)+1 is odd. So gcd(64(k-1)+1, 256) = 1. The set {a^(i(64(k-1)+1)) * b} for i=0..255 is the entire coset <a>b.\n    *   Therefore, G^k = <a> U <a>b = G.\n    *   This gives **1** power subgroup (the group G itself).\n\n4.  **Calculation for even k (k=2m)**:\n    *   (a^i)^k = a^(i*2m). The set of these elements forms the subgroup <a^(gcd(2m, 256))>.\n    *   (a^i*b)^k = (a^i*b)^(2m) = ((a^i*b)^2)^m = (a^(128i))^m = a^(128im). The set of these elements forms the subgroup <a^(gcd(128m, 256))>.\n    *   The resulting power subgroup G^k is the subgroup generated by both sets of powers: <a^(gcd(2m, 256)), a^(gcd(128m, 256))>.\n    *   As shown before, gcd(2m, 256) divides gcd(128m, 256), which means <a^(gcd(128m, 256))> is a subgroup of <a^(gcd(2m, 256))>.\n    *   So, G^k = <a^(gcd(2m, 256))>.\n    *   The subgroup is determined by d = gcd(2m, 256). As k=2m is an even integer, d must be an even divisor of 256.\n    *   The divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\n    *   The even divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\n    *   For any such even divisor d, we can find an m (e.g., m=d/2) such that d = gcd(2m, 256).\n    *   This gives the distinct subgroups: <a^2>, <a^4>, <a^8>, <a^16>, <a^32>, <a^64>, <a^128>, <a^256>.\n    *   <a^256> is the trivial subgroup {e}. This can also be obtained by k=0 (G^0 = {e}).\n    *   This gives **8** distinct power subgroups.\n\n5.  **Total Count**:\n    *   1 subgroup from odd k (G itself).\n    *   8 subgroups from even k (which are all subgroups of <a> that are not <a> itself).\n    *   Total = 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nThe logic seems solid and self-contained. The search results, while interesting, do not contradict this finding and are focused on a different, though related, topic. I am confident in my derivation.\n\nFinal list of power subgroups:\n1.  G\n2.  <a^2>\n3.  <a^4>\n4.  <a^8>\n5.  <a^16>\n6.  <a^32>\n7.  <a^64>\n8.  <a^128>\n9.  <a^256> = {e}\n\nThe number is 9.\nThe semidihedral group of size 512 is SD_512, which corresponds to n=9 in the notation SD_{2^n}.\nThe maximal cyclic subgroup <a> has order 2^(n-1) = 2^8 = 256.\nThe power subgroups are G itself, and the subgroups of <a> of the form <a^d> where d is an even divisor of 2^(n-1).\nThe divisors of 2^(n-1) = 256 are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^8.\nThe even divisors are 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^8. There are 8 such divisors.\nSo, we have G and 8 subgroups of <a>.\nTotal = 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nThe reasoning holds. I am ready to give the final answer.\n<<<9>>>"
