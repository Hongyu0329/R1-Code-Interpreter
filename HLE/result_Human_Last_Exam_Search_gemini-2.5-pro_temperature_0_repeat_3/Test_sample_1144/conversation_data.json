    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the uncertainty in the electron's momentum.**\n    This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is at least the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. The formula is:\n    Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\n    We are given the uncertainty in position, Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n    The reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n    To find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Δp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\n    Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n2.  **Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.**\n    According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in an orbit is quantized and is given by L = nħ, where 'n' is the principal quantum number. For the first Bohr orbit, n=1, so the angular momentum is L = ħ.\n\n    The angular momentum is also defined as L = p * r, where 'p' is the linear momentum and 'r' is the radius of the orbit. For the first Bohr orbit, the radius is the Bohr radius (a₀), which is approximately 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\n    Therefore, the momentum (p) of the electron is:\n    p = L / r = ħ / a₀\n    p = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\n    p ≈ 1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n3.  **Find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum.**\n    Ratio = Δp / p\n    Ratio = (5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s) / (1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\n    Ratio ≈ 2.646\n\n<<<2.646>>>"
