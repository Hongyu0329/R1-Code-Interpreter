    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the motor passenger ship **Brazza**.\n\nThe *Brazza*, with a tonnage of 10,387 tons, was sunk on May 28, 1940, by the German submarine U-37. The attack occurred approximately 80 miles west of Cape Finisterre, Spain. The ship was part of convoy 60-XF and was en route from Bordeaux to Casablanca. Two torpedoes struck the *Brazza*, causing it to sink rapidly within five minutes, resulting in the loss of 379 lives out of the 576 people on board.\n\nAnother significant French loss to a U-boat during this period was the steam tanker *Monique*, which had a tonnage of 7,011 tons. It was sunk by U-65 on June 22, 1940, the same day the armistice was signed.\n\nNaval losses to U-boats before the armistice included the submarine *Doris*, which had a much smaller displacement of 525/765 tons and was sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940. While other French ships were sunk by U-37 in the same period, such as the trawler *Julien* and the steamer *Marie Jos√©*, a passenger liner like the *Brazza* was substantially larger.\n\n<<<Brazza>>>"
