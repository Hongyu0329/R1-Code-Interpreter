    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for a female sibling would likely be **\"swester\"**.\n\nThe current English word \"sister\" was adopted from the Old Norse word *systir*. This occurred due to the significant linguistic influence of Norse settlers in England, particularly between the 9th and 11th centuries. The Norse word ultimately displaced the native Old English term for a female sibling.\n\nThe original Old English word was ***sweostor***. Both the Old English *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir* originate from the same Proto-Germanic root, *\\*swestēr*, which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *\\*swésōr*.\n\nWithout the influence of Old Norse, the Old English *sweostor* would have undergone natural phonetic changes over the centuries, similar to other native English words. Based on the evolution of similar words and sounds, the likely progression would have been:\n*   **Old English:** *sweostor*\n*   **Middle English:** *swester*\n*   **Modern English:** *swester*\n\nThis developmental path is supported by looking at related words in other West Germanic languages that did not have the same level of Norse influence on this particular vocabulary item. For example, the German word is ***Schwester*** and the Dutch words are ***zuster*** and ***zus***. These cognates show a similar evolutionary path from the common Proto-Germanic ancestor, suggesting that \"swester\" would be the natural Modern English equivalent.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
