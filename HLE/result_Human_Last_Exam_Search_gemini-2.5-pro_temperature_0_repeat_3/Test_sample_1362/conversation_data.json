    "Based on the analysis of the reduction properties of the given curves at primes greater than 2, we need to determine which curve exhibits good ordinary reduction.\n\nA curve defined by the equation z² = f(x) has **good reduction** at a prime p > 2 if the discriminant of the polynomial f(x) is not divisible by p. This ensures that the reduced curve over the finite field F_p is smooth.\n\nA curve with good reduction at p is said to be **ordinary** if the trace of the Frobenius endomorphism on its Jacobian is not divisible by p. For a hyperelliptic curve of genus g, a practical way to check this is to compute the number of points on the curve over F_p, denoted N_p. The trace of Frobenius, a_p, is then given by N_p = p + 1 - a_p. The curve has ordinary reduction if a_p is not congruent to 0 modulo p.\n\nLet's analyze the options at small odd primes.\n\n**Analysis at p = 3:**\n*   **A. z² = x⁵ + 3:** The polynomial becomes z² = x⁵ over F₃. The discriminant of x⁵ + 3 is 5⁵ * 3⁴, which is divisible by 3. Thus, the curve has **bad reduction** at p=3.\n*   **B. z² = x⁵ - 1:** The discriminant is 5⁵, which is not divisible by 3. The curve has good reduction. The number of affine points over F₃ is 3, and there is one point at infinity, so N₃ = 4. The trace is a₃ = 3 + 1 - 4 = 0. Since a₃ is divisible by 3, the reduction is **supersingular**.\n*   **C. z² = x⁶ - 1:** The discriminant is -6⁶, which is divisible by 3. The curve has **bad reduction** at p=3.\n*   **D. z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1:** The discriminant is 40144 = 16 * 2509, which is not divisible by 3. The curve has good reduction. The number of affine points over F₃ is 3, and there is one point at infinity, so N₃ = 4. The trace is a₃ = 3 + 1 - 4 = 0. The reduction is **supersingular**.\n*   **E. z² = 4x⁵ + 4x³ + x² + 4x:** The discriminant is -2516799 = -3 * 838933, which is divisible by 3. The curve has **bad reduction** at p=3.\n\nThe analysis at p=3 does not distinguish a curve with good ordinary reduction. Let's proceed to the next prime.\n\n**Analysis at p = 5:**\n*   **A. z² = x⁵ + 3:** The discriminant is divisible by 5. The curve has **bad reduction** at p=5.\n*   **B. z² = x⁵ - 1:** The discriminant is 5⁵, which is divisible by 5. The curve has **bad reduction** at p=5.\n*   **C. z² = x⁶ - 1:** The discriminant is not divisible by 5. The curve has good reduction. The number of affine points over F₅ is 4, and there are two points at infinity, so N₅ = 6. The trace is a₅ = 5 + 1 - 6 = 0. The reduction is **supersingular**.\n*   **D. z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1:** The discriminant is not divisible by 5. The curve has good reduction. Let's count the points over F₅:\n    *   x=0 ⇒ z²=1 ⇒ z=±1 (2 points)\n    *   x=1 ⇒ z²=2+2+1=5=0 ⇒ z=0 (1 point)\n    *   x=2 ⇒ z²=2(32)+2(8)+1 = 4+16+1=21=1 ⇒ z=±1 (2 points)\n    *   x=3 ⇒ z²=2(243)+2(27)+1 = 6+54+1=61=1 ⇒ z=±1 (2 points)\n    *   x=4 ⇒ z²=2(1024)+2(64)+1 = 8+128+1=137=2 (no solution)\n    The number of affine points is 2+1+2+2 = 7. There is one point at infinity. Thus, N₅ = 8. The trace is a₅ = 5 + 1 - 8 = -2. Since a₅ = -2 is not divisible by 5, the curve has **good ordinary reduction** at p=5.\n*   **E. z² = 4x⁵ + 4x³ + x² + 4x:** The discriminant is not divisible by 5. The curve has good reduction. The number of affine points over F₅ is 5, and there is one point at infinity, so N₅ = 6. The trace is a₅ = 5 + 1 - 6 = 0. The reduction is **supersingular**.\n\nThe analysis at p=5 shows that only the curve z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1 has good ordinary reduction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
