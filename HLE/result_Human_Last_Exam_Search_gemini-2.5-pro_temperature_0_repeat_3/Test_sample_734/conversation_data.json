    "Augustine of Hippo was the first Christian theologian to develop specialized terminology applicable to describing changes in the laws of nature, relevant to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws believed to have occurred at the Fall.\n\nAugustine articulated a sophisticated framework for understanding miracles and changes in the natural order through two key concepts:\n\n*   ***Rationes Seminales* (Seminal Reasons):** Augustine proposed that God embedded \"seminal reasons\" or latent causal principles into creation from the very beginning. These are invisible, seed-like potentials for all things that would eventually come into being. According to this view, a miracle is not a violation of the created order but the activation by God of a pre-ordained potential that lies outside the normal, observable course of nature. This concept was central to his explanation of how humanity could be \"seminally present\" in Adam, thereby inheriting the corrupted nature that resulted from the Fall. The Fall itself represented a fundamental alteration in the state of nature, a change Augustine's terminology could describe.\n\n*   ***Non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura* (Not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know of nature):** This famous maxim encapsulates Augustine's understanding of miracles. He argued that an event like the virgin birth is not contrary to nature as it truly is—since the will of God is the ultimate nature of all created things—but is only contrary to nature as it is known to humanity through regular observation. This distinction allowed for God to act in extraordinary ways, such as in the virgin birth, without being seen as acting against His own established order.\n\nThrough these concepts, Augustine provided a theological language to explain events that seemingly alter or suspend the ordinary laws of nature, a framework applicable to both the unique miracle of the virgin birth and the enduring changes to the natural order resulting from the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
