**(a) Diversity Order:**
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_a$ is 1.
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_b$ is 1.
*   The diversity order for code $\mathbf{S}_c$ is 2.

**(b) Maximum Directivity:**
Code $\mathbf{S}_c$ provides the maximum "directivity" or, more accurately, the best performance, as it is the only code among the three to achieve full diversity order (diversity order of 2). This ensures a higher robustness to channel fading and superior error rate performance.
