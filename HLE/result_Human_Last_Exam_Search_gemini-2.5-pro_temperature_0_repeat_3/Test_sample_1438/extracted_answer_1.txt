The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a number but is formally defined by the rules of Berezin integration: the integral of the variable itself is 1, and the integral of 1 is 0. This, combined with the property that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero, ensures the Pauli exclusion principle is maintained.
