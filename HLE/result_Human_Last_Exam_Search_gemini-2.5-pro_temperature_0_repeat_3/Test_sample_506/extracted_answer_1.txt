**1. Valsartan:** As an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), valsartan is a crucial recommendation. While some data suggest ARBs may be less effective as a single therapy for blood pressure in African American patients, they are strongly indicated for individuals with comorbidities like type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease to provide organ protection. The African American Study of Kidney and Hypertension (AASK) trial demonstrated that an ACE inhibitor (a similar class of drug) was more effective in reducing the risk of worsening kidney disease, particularly in patients with proteinuria. Given MM's diabetes, an ARB is a foundational part of her regimen.

**2. Amlodipine:** This long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) is a first-line choice for treating hypertension in African American patients. Guidelines consistently recommend either a CCB or a thiazide-type diuretic as initial or core therapy in this population due to their high efficacy. Combining a CCB with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker like valsartan is a potent and evidence-based strategy.

**3. Chlorthalidone:** Since MM has resistant hypertension (uncontrolled on three medications), a powerful diuretic is essential. While several diuretics are on her exclusion list, chlorthalidone is not. It is a long-acting, thiazide-like diuretic that is more potent at lowering blood pressure than the more commonly used hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Guidelines from the American Heart Association for managing resistant hypertension specifically recommend using a long-acting thiazide-like diuretic such as chlorthalidone. The combination of an ARB (valsartan), a CCB (amlodipine), and a thiazide-like diuretic (chlorthalidone) represents a standard and highly effective triple-therapy regimen for difficult-to-control blood pressure.
