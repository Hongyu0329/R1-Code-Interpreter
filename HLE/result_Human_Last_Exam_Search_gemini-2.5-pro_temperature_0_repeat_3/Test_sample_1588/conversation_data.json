    "When expressed in a suitable basis of the free Lie algebra, such as the Lyndon basis, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 55.\n\nThe BCH formula, Z = log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>), can be expanded as a series of homogeneous Lie polynomials, Z = ∑<sub>n=1</sub><sup>∞</sup> Z<sub>n</sub>(X,Y), where Z<sub>n</sub> is the term of order n. The number of linearly independent terms of order *n* is given by the dimension of the *n*-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, L<sub>n</sub>(X,Y). For order 10, the dimension, calculated using Witt's formula, is 99. This means there are 99 basis elements, and thus 99 coefficients, at this order.\n\nHowever, not all of these coefficients are necessarily nonzero. Research by Casas and Murua has shown that when the BCH series is expressed in the Lyndon basis, a significant number of coefficients for even-ordered terms are zero. For an even order *n*, the number of vanishing coefficients is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of vanishing coefficients = dim(L<sub>n</sub>) - dim(L<sub>n-1</sub>) + 1\n\nFor order 10:\n*   The dimension of the free Lie algebra of degree 10, dim(L<sub>10</sub>), is 99.\n*   The dimension of the free Lie algebra of degree 9, dim(L<sub>9</sub>), is 56.\n\nUsing the formula, the number of vanishing coefficients of order 10 is:\n99 - 56 + 1 = 44.\n\nTherefore, the number of nonzero coefficients is the total number of coefficients minus the number of vanishing ones:\n99 - 44 = 55.\n\n<<<55>>>"
