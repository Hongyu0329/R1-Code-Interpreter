    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, can be determined through the renormalization group analysis.\n\nThe beta function, β(u), describes the running of the coupling constant 'u' with the energy scale. To the leading order in 'u' and ϵ, the beta function is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + Bu²\n\nwhere the first term arises from the classical scaling of the coupling constant and the second term is the one-loop quantum correction. The fixed points of the theory are the values of 'u' for which the beta function is zero, i.e., β(u*) = 0. This equation has two solutions:\n\n1.  u* = 0, which corresponds to the trivial Gaussian fixed point.\n2.  u* = ϵ/B, which is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nThe constant 'B' depends on the normalization of the ϕ⁴ interaction term in the Lagrangian. A standard convention in quantum field theory is to define the interaction term as (λ/4!)ϕ⁴. With this normalization, the one-loop calculation for a single scalar field (which corresponds to the N=1 case of the O(N) model) yields a value of B = 3 / (16π²).\n\nTherefore, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling is:\n\nu* = ϵ / (3 / (16π²)) = (16π²/3)ϵ\n\nThis result is a cornerstone of the ϵ-expansion and is crucial for calculating critical exponents in statistical mechanics.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ε>>>"
