    "A unitary quantum gate operation on a single qubit corresponds to a rotation of the Bloch sphere. This means that the geometric relationship between the states on the Bloch sphere must be preserved. The six basis states given correspond to the six cardinal directions on the Bloch sphere:\n\n*   ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩ are on the Z-axis (North and South poles).\n*   ∣+⟩ and ∣-⟩ are on the X-axis.\n*   ∣i⟩ and ∣-i⟩ are on the Y-axis.\n\nThese three axes are mutually orthogonal. A rotation of the sphere is a rigid transformation, meaning it must preserve the angles between these axes. The transformed axes must also be mutually orthogonal. Furthermore, any rotation must preserve the \"handedness\" of the coordinate system. This is mathematically captured by the determinant of the 3x3 rotation matrix being +1. A transformation with a determinant of -1 is an \"improper rotation\" (like an inversion or reflection) and cannot be achieved by a unitary gate.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation for each answer choice by seeing how it transforms the X, Y, and Z axes of the Bloch sphere.\n\n**Answer Choice A:**\n*   **Z-axis transformation:** ∣0⟩ → ∣1⟩ and ∣1⟩ → ∣0⟩. This maps the +Z direction to the -Z direction and vice-versa. (Z → -Z)\n*   **X-axis transformation:** ∣+⟩ → ∣-⟩ and ∣-⟩ → ∣+⟩. This maps the +X direction to the -X direction and vice-versa. (X → -X)\n*   **Y-axis transformation:** ∣i⟩ → ∣-i⟩ and ∣-i⟩ → ∣i⟩. This maps the +Y direction to the -Y direction and vice-versa. (Y → -Y)\n\nThis transformation maps every point (x, y, z) on the sphere to (-x, -y, -z). This is a point inversion through the origin. The matrix for this transformation is:\nR = [[-1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, -1]]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is det(R) = (-1) * (-1) * (-1) = -1.\n\nSince the determinant is -1, this is an improper rotation (an inversion), not a proper rotation. Therefore, it cannot be implemented by any unitary quantum gate. All other transformations listed correspond to proper rotations (determinant +1) and are thus possible.\n\nFor example, let's check Answer Choice B:\n*   **Z-axis transformation:** ∣0⟩ → ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩ → ∣1⟩. (Z → Z)\n*   **X-axis transformation:** ∣+⟩ → ∣-⟩ and ∣-⟩ → ∣+⟩. (X → -X)\n*   **Y-axis transformation:** ∣i⟩ → ∣-i⟩ and ∣-i⟩ → ∣i⟩. (Y → -Y)\n\nThe matrix for this transformation is:\nR = [[-1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0],]\n\nThe determinant is det(R) = (-1) * (-1) * (1) = +1. This is a proper rotation (specifically, a 180-degree rotation around the Z-axis, which corresponds to the Pauli-Z gate) and is therefore a possible operation.\n\nThe only transformation that corresponds to an improper rotation (determinant -1) is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
