    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is a scenario that does not appear to directly match the details of any specific movie. It is possible that details from different films have been combined in memory.\n\nSeveral Oscar-nominated films feature pivotal and tragic bus scenes, but none align perfectly with the described sequence of events:\n\n*   **The Sweet Hereafter (1997):** This film, which received two Oscar nominations, revolves around the aftermath of a tragic school bus accident that kills many of the town's children. While the bus scene is central to the plot, there is no character who says \"Thank you\" upon boarding to seal their fate.\n\n*   **Watu Wote: All of Us (2017):** A nominee for Best Live Action Short Film, this movie recounts the true story of a bus attack in Kenya by Al-Shabaab terrorists. In a heroic act, Muslim passengers protect their Christian fellow travelers. One of the Muslim passengers, Salah Farah, confronts the terrorists and is fatally shot as a result of his bravery on the bus. However, the specific dialogue of \"Thank you\" as a final statement is not part of this narrative.\n\nOther films with notable bus-related tragedies do not fit the criteria either:\n\n*   **Simon Birch (1998):** In this film, the titular character is a hero in a bus crash. While he does say \"Thank you, Miss Wentworth\" earlier in the film, it is not as he is boarding the bus that ultimately leads to his death. This film was not nominated for an Academy Award.\n\n*   **Final Destination (2000):** This horror film features a character being unexpectedly hit and killed by a bus. The scene is sudden and does not involve the character speaking the line \"Thank you\" beforehand. This movie did not receive any Oscar nominations.\n\nWhile the precise scene described in the question is not identifiable within an Oscar-nominated film based on available information, it highlights the memorable and impactful nature of bus scenes in cinema.\n\n<<<I am unable to find a film that matches the exact description provided.>>>"
