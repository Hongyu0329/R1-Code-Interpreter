    "The evidence strongly suggests that \"HE\" is the French Marxist philosopher and sociologist Henri Lefebvre, and that \"Veronika Campan\" is a likely misspelling of Veronika Deffner, a scholar who has written about his work.\n\nHenri Lefebvre's theory of the production of space provides the framework for understanding the concepts in the query. He proposed a spatial triad:\n\n*   **Representations of space (the conceived):** This is the space of planners, architects, and authorities, which is abstract and dominant in capitalist society.\n*   **Spaces of representation (the lived):** This is the space of inhabitants, imbued with symbolism and meaning, which is often dominated and marginalized.\n*   **Spatial practice (the perceived):** This is the everyday reality and routine of life in space.\n\nAccording to Lefebvre's analysis, the dominant \"representations of space\" in a capitalist society impose a certain order and meaning on space, which can be seen as a \"prohibition against representation\" for the inhabitants whose own lived experiences and symbolic meanings of that space are suppressed. This conceived space, controlled by capital and the state, dictates how material possessions and the environment are to be used and perceived, leading to the alienation of individuals from their surroundings. Therefore, the issue of \"another's material possessions\" is addressed through this lens of spatial alienation, where the spaces people inhabit are not truly their own but are controlled by external forces.\n\nVeronika Deffner has applied Lefebvre's theories in her research, particularly in her studies of urban spaces like the favelas in Brazil. Her work examines the conflict between the official, conceived representations of these spaces and the lived reality of their inhabitants, directly engaging with Lefebvre's ideas on spatial production and alienation.\n\n<<<Henri Lefebvre>>>"
