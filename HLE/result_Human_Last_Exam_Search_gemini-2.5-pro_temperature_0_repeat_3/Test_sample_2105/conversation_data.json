    "I am unable to provide the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide.\n\nThe major reduction product is perylene-3-thiol (C₂₀H₁₂S). The calculation of the Szeged and Wiener indices, particularly when including all 34 hydrogen and non-hydrogen atoms as requested, requires specialized computational chemistry software.\n\nDespite extensive searches for pre-calculated values in scientific literature and chemical databases, the specific numerical values for the Wiener index and the Szeged index of perylene-3-thiol, inclusive of hydrogen atoms, could not be found. Access to computational software like WolframAlpha, Dragon, or specific ChemAxon plugins is necessary to generate these topological indices from the molecule's structure. Without these specific numerical inputs, the ratio cannot be determined.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
