    "There are 39 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\nA \"power subgroup\" is generally understood to be a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, has the presentation  `<a, x | a^64 = 1, x^2 = a^32, xax^(-1) = a^(-1)>`.\n\nThe number of cyclic subgroups in a generalized quaternion group of order 2^n (where n â‰¥ 3) can be calculated with the formula: 2^(n-2) + n.\n\nFor Q_128, the order is 128, which is 2^7. Therefore, n = 7.\n\nSubstituting n = 7 into the formula gives:\n2^(7-2) + 7 = 2^5 + 7 = 32 + 7 = 39.\n\nThis can be broken down as follows:\n*   The cyclic subgroup `<a>` has order 64. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order `m` is equal to the number of divisors of `m`. Since 64 = 2^6, it has 6 + 1 = 7 divisors. Thus, there are 7 cyclic subgroups contained within `<a>`.\n*   The remaining 64 elements are of the form `a^i * x`, where `i` ranges from 0 to 63. All of these elements have an order of 4. Each of these elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. These subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroups of `<a>` (except for the trivial subgroup). For every two elements `a^i * x` and `a^(i+32) * x`, they generate the same cyclic subgroup. Therefore, the 64 elements of this form generate 64 / 2 = 32 distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nIn total, the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
