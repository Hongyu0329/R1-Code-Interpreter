No, it is generally not possible to stabilize a localized soliton in a 3D Hamiltonian with only Heisenberg exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The ground state of such a system is typically a periodic magnetic structure like a helix or spiral. Additional interactions, such as an external magnetic field or magnetic anisotropy, are required to stabilize a localized soliton.
