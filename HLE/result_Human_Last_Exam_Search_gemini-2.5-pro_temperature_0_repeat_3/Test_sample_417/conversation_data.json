    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry is required. The number of peaks, in this context, refers to the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons, also known as signals or resonances.\n\nThe molecule can be broken down into a central core and three identical \"arms\" attached to it.\n\n1.  **The Central Core**: The core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring, substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. A C3 axis of rotation passes through the center of this ring, making the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 chemically equivalent. Therefore, these nine protons will produce a single peak.\n\n2.  **The Linker Groups**: Three methylene (-CH2-) groups link the central ring to the indazole units. Due to the C3 symmetry, these three methylene groups are equivalent to each other. However, each methylene group is attached to a chiral center (the complex indazole substituent). This makes the two protons within each methylene group diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. Consequently, the six protons of these three linker groups will give rise to two distinct peaks.\n\n3.  **The Indazole \"Arms\"**: The three substituents are identical `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` groups. Because of the C3 symmetry, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in one of these units. This unit is a complex, chiral, bicyclic system derived from camphor, often referred to as campho[2,3-c]pyrazole.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton**: There is one proton on the pyrazole ring portion of the indazole system. This will produce one peak.\n    *   **Bicyclic Skeleton Protons**: The saturated, bridged portion of the molecule (the camphor framework) contains several non-equivalent protons:\n        *   One proton at a bridgehead position (C4). This gives one peak.\n        *   Two methylene groups (at C5 and C6). The protons of each CH2 group are diastereotopic (endo and exo) and are not equivalent to each other or to the protons of the other CH2 group. This results in four distinct peaks (two for each CH2 group).\n    *   **Methyl Group Protons**: The camphor-derived framework has three methyl groups. Due to the overall chirality of the molecule, these three methyl groups are all in different chemical environments and are therefore non-equivalent. This will result in three separate peaks.\n\n**Summary of the Peaks:**\n\n*   **Central Ring Methyls**: 1 peak\n*   **Linker -CH2- Protons**: 2 peaks\n*   **Indazole Arm Protons**:\n    *   Pyrazole H: 1 peak\n    *   Bridgehead H: 1 peak\n    *   Skeleton -CH2- Protons: 4 peaks\n    *   Methyl Group Protons: 3 peaks\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 12 peaks.\n\nTherefore, a total of 12 distinct signals are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
