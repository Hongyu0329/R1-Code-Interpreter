    "The connectivity of the map `φ: Σ ( ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) → Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)` is a classical result in algebraic topology. According to a theorem by G.W. Whitehead, the connectivity of this map is determined by the connectivity of the spheres involved.\n\nA space `X` is said to be `k`-connected if all of its homotopy groups `π_i(X)` are trivial for `i ≤ k`. A map `f: A → B` is `k`-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, `π_i(f)`, is an isomorphism for `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`.\n\nFirst, let's determine the connectivity of the spaces in question:\n*   The sphere `S^n` is `(n-1)`-connected. Thus, `S^4` is 3-connected and `S^6` is 5-connected.\n*   The loop space `ΩX` has connectivity one less than `X`. So, `ΩS^4` is 2-connected and `ΩS^6` is 4-connected.\n*   The smash product `X ∧ Y` of a `p`-connected space `X` and a `q`-connected space `Y` is `(p+q+1)`-connected. Therefore, `ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6` is `(2+4+1) = 7`-connected.\n*   The suspension `ΣX` has connectivity one more than `X`. Thus, the source space `Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)` is `(7+1) = 8`-connected.\n*   For the target space, `S^4 ∧ S^6` is `(3+5+1) = 9`-connected. The loop space `Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)` is therefore `(9-1) = 8`-connected.\n\nSince both the source and target spaces are 8-connected, the map is trivially an isomorphism on `π_i` for `i ≤ 8`, which means the map is at least 9-connected.\n\nThe relevant theorem on the connectivity of the map `φ: Σ(ΩX ∧ ΩY) → Ω(X ∧ Y)` states that if `X` is `(r-1)`-connected and `Y` is `(s-1)`-connected, then the map `φ` is `(r+s-1)`-connected.\nIn our case, `X = S^4` is 3-connected, so `r-1=3` which gives `r=4`. The space `Y = S^6` is 5-connected, so `s-1=5` which gives `s=6`.\n\nApplying the formula, the connectivity of the map is `r+s-1 = 4+6-1 = 9`.\n\nThis means the map induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups `π_i` for `i < 9` and a surjection on `π_9`.\n\n<<<9>>>"
