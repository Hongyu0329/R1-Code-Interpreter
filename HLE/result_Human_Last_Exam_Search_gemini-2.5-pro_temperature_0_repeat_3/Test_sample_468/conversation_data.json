    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is \"fairy bees\". They are also sometimes referred to as \"miner bees\".\n\nThe exact year the term \"fairy bees\" was coined is difficult to pinpoint as common names for many bee genera are not formally standardized and often come into use gradually. An iNaturalist forum post suggests the name may have been informally adopted around 2016, possibly on social media. However, the term appears on resources such as BugGuide.net with content dating back to at least 2004, indicating its use for two decades or more.\n\n<<<fairy bees, not definitively known>>>"
