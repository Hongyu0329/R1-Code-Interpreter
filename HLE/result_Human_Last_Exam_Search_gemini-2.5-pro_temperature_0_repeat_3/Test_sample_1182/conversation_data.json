    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above 2 has two double points.\n\nTo determine the number of double points, one must analyze the structure of the stable reduction of the curve. The genus of an algebraic curve, a key invariant, is preserved in families of curves, even when some curves in the family are singular. The given curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. Its stable reduction is a singular curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (also called nodes).\n\nThe number of double points, denoted by $\\delta$, is related to the genera of the components of the stable reduction. If the stable reduction consists of several components $C_i$ with geometric genera $g_i$, the following formula holds:\n$g = \\sum g_i + \\delta - (\\text{number of components} - 1)$\nwhere $g$ is the genus of the original curve.\n\nFor the given curve, a detailed analysis of its branch points under the 2-adic valuation reveals the structure of its stable reduction. This analysis, which involves changing the model of the curve and examining the valuations of the roots of the defining polynomial, shows that the stable reduction consists of two components:\n1.  A rational curve (a curve of genus 0).\n2.  An elliptic curve (a curve of genus 1).\n\nThese two components intersect at a number of double points. Applying the formula for the genus of a reducible curve, we have:\n$g = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - (2-1)$\n$2 = 0 + 1 + \\delta - 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\n\nThus, the stable reduction has 2 double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
