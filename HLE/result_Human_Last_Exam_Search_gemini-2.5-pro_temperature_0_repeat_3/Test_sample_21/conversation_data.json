    "The problem asks for the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\nThis density is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, through the Chebotarev Density Theorem. The theorem states that the density of primes for which a polynomial has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group with the corresponding cycle structure.\n\nFor the polynomial $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, its factorization must consist of a single irreducible factor of degree 7. This corresponds to the elements of the Galois group that act as a 7-cycle on the roots of the polynomial.\n\nThe key steps to solve the problem are:\n1.  Identify the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  Count the number of 7-cycles within this group.\n3.  Calculate the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group.\n\nThe polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is a known example in Galois theory. Its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ (also denoted as $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$). This group has an order of 21.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. Its elements consist of:\n*   The identity element (1 element).\n*   Elements of order 3, which are products of two disjoint 3-cycles (7 elements).\n*   Elements of order 7, which are 7-cycles (6 elements).\n*   The remaining elements are also 7-cycles, organized into two conjugacy classes of 6 elements each, totaling 12 elements of order 7.\n\nIn total, the group $F_{21}$ contains $6 + 6 = 12$ elements that are 7-cycles.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the order of the group.\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$) / (Order of $F_{21}$)\nDensity = 12 / 21\nDensity = 4 / 7\n\nThus, the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible mod $p$ is 4/7.\n\n<<<4/7>>>"
