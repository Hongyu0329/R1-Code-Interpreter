    "Gene duplication is a primary source of new genetic material, but for a duplicated gene to be meaningful for evolution, it must be kept in the genome and diverge in function. Several mechanisms explain how this occurs.\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This process involves the nonreciprocal transfer of genetic information between similar DNA sequences, such as duplicated genes. This mechanism tends to homogenize the sequences of the duplicates, working against their divergence. While it can play a role in the early evolution of duplicates, it is not the primary mechanism for retaining two distinct, divergent copies.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. One copy accumulates mutations that render it non-functional, turning it into a \"pseudogene\". This process describes the *loss* of a duplicate's function, not its retention and divergence into a new or partitioned role.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and acquires a completely new, beneficial function. This is a key mechanism for evolutionary innovation and explains both the retention of the duplicate (due to its new benefit) and its divergence.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns. After duplication, each copy loses a different subset of the original functions through mutation. As a result, both copies are now required to carry out the full suite of the ancestral gene's original functions. This \"division of labor\" ensures both copies are retained and allows them to diverge.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species. While gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for such radiations, adaptive radiation itself is a macroevolutionary outcome, not a direct molecular mechanism for retaining specific genes within a genome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are the major accepted mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. Pseudogenization is the most common fate overall, but it represents gene loss, not retention of function. Gene conversion works against divergence. Between neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely initial step for preserving duplicates. It relies on common, degenerative mutations to make both copies necessary, providing a stable state from which a new function might later evolve (a process sometimes called sub-neofunctionalization). Neofunctionalization requires a rarer beneficial mutation to occur before the duplicate is lost. Therefore, both C and D are critical, but subfunctionalization provides a more common pathway for the initial retention of both gene copies. Given the options, both C and D are strong candidates, but they represent the core mechanisms of retention through functional divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
