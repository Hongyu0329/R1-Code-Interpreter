The number of times the procedure must be repeated, `n`, is given by the function:
`n(ε, δ) = ceil( log(ε) / log( (1 - δ) / (1 + δ) ) )`
where `ceil(x)` is the ceiling function (the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`), and `log` can be a logarithm of any base (e.g., the natural logarithm).
