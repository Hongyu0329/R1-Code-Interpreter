    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used. This is determined by calculating the number of functions for each atom and summing them.\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, meaning it consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence double-zeta basis set. The notation specifies how many contracted Gaussian functions are used for the core and valence electrons of each atom.\n\n**For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** The \"6-\" indicates that the core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted function.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The \"-31\" signifies that the valence orbitals are split into two parts. The inner part is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the outer part is a single primitive Gaussian. This results in:\n    *   One contracted function for the inner 2s orbital and one for the outer 2s orbital (2 total for 2s).\n    *   For each of the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz), there is one inner and one outer contracted function, totaling 2 functions per p orbital (3 * 2 = 6 total for 2p).\n*   In total, each carbon atom uses 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   Hydrogen has only a 1s valence orbital and no core electrons.\n*   Its 1s orbital is split into two, as described by the \"-31\" part of the basis set name.\n*   Therefore, each hydrogen atom uses **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**Total Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):**\n*   **From Carbon:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **From Hydrogen:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = **79 contracted Gaussian functions**\n\n<<<79>>>"
