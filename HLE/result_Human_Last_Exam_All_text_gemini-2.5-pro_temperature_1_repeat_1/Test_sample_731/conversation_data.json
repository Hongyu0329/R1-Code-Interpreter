    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group ($SD_{2^n}$):** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The question specifies the size of the group is 512.\n    $|SD_{2^n}| = 2^n = 512 \\implies n=9$.\n    So, the group in question is $G = SD_{512}$, with the presentation:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$) and $sr^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$).\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it is of the form $H = G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Power Subgroups to the Group Exponent**\n\nThe set of power subgroups $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is related to the exponent of the group, $exp(G)$, which is the least common multiple of the orders of all elements in $G$. A key property is that for any integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is equal to $G^d$, where $d = \\gcd(k, exp(G))$. This means we only need to consider the power subgroups $G^k$ where $k$ is a divisor of $exp(G)$.\n\nFirst, let's find the exponent of $G = SD_{512}$.\n1.  The elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ have orders that divide $256$. The maximum order is $o(r) = 256$.\n2.  Let's find the orders of the elements of the form $sr^i$. We can compute the square of such an element:\n    $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i$. From the relation $srs=r^{127}$, we can derive $sr^i s = (srs)^i = (r^{127})^i = r^{127i}$. (This is not quite right, the correct relation is $sr^i s = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1)}$ only if we use $srs^{-1}$, but here we have $srs$. The relation $sr^i s = r^{i(k+1)}$ with $srs^{-1}=r^k$ is easier. Let's use $sr^i s = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1)} = r^{127i}$ is wrong. The correct way is $sr^i s = (srs)r^{i-1}s = r^{127}sr^{i-1}s$. A simpler derivation is $sr^i s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^i$. Using $s^{-1}=s$, we get $srs=r^{127}$. Then $sr = r^{127}s$. It follows that $sr^i = r^{127i}s$. Let's check: $sr^2 = sr \\cdot r = r^{127}s \\cdot r = r^{127}r^{127}s = r^{2 \\cdot 127}s$. So $sr^i=r^{127i}s$.\n    Then $(sr^i)^2 = (sr^i)(sr^i) = (r^{127i}s)(sr^i) = r^{127i}(s^2)r^i = r^{127i}r^i = r^{128i}$.\n    Let's use the other relation $srs^{-1} = r^k$. $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i = (sr^is^{-1})r^i = (srs^{-1})^i r^i = (r^{127})^i r^i = r^{127i}r^i=r^{128i}$. This derivation has an error too. The correct one is $(sr^i)^2 = sr^is r^i = s(r^is)r^i$. From $srs=r^k$, $rs=s r^{-k}$. So $r^is=sr^{-ki}$. Then $(sr^i)^2 = s(sr^{-ki})r^i=r^{-ki}r^i=r^{i(1-k)}=r^{i(1-(2^{n-2}-1))}=r^{i(2-2^{n-2})}$. Wait, this is also complicated.\n    Let's use the standard result: $(sr^i)^2 = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1)+i} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}} = r^{128i}$.\n    *   If $i$ is even, $i=2j$, then $(sr^{2j})^2 = r^{128 \\cdot 2j} = r^{256j} = 1$. So, $sr^{2j}$ has order 2.\n    *   If $i$ is odd, $i=2j+1$, then $(sr^{2j+1})^2 = r^{128(2j+1)} = r^{256j}r^{128} = r^{128}$. Since $o(r^{128})=2$, the order of $sr^{2j+1}$ is 4.\n3.  The maximum element order in $G$ is 256. Therefore, $exp(G) = 256 = 2^8$.\n\nThe divisors of $exp(G)=256$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$. These are 9 divisors: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$. We need to compute $G^k$ for these values of $k$ and count the number of distinct resulting subgroups.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Power Subgroups $G^k$**\n\nWe need to compute $G^k = \\langle (r^i)^k, (sr^i)^k \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $k$ is odd**\n    In our list of divisors, only $k=1$ is odd.\n    For $k=1$, $G^1 = \\langle g^1 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = G$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $k$ is even**\n    For $k \\in \\{2, 4, ..., 256\\}$, $k$ is even. Let's find a general formula for $G^k$ when $k$ is even.\n    The generators of $G^k$ are $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$ and $(sr^i)^k$.\n    As shown before, $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$.\n    For an even $k=2m$, we have $(sr^i)^k = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^{128i})^m = r^{128im}$.\n    So, $G^k = \\langle \\{r^{ik}\\}_{i}, \\{r^{128im}\\}_{i} \\rangle$.\n    The set of generators $\\{r^{ik}\\}_{i}$ generates the subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    The set of generators $\\{r^{128im}\\}_{i}$ (with $m=k/2$) generates $\\langle r^{\\gcd(128m, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(64k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    Thus, $G^k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)}, r^{\\gcd(64k, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256, 64k)} \\rangle$.\n    Since $k$ is a factor of $64k$, $\\gcd(k, 64k) = k$.\n    So, $G^k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    This simple formula holds for all even $k$.\n\n**Step 4: List the Distinct Power Subgroups and Count Them**\n\nNow we apply the formulas to our list of divisors $k=2^j$ for $j=0, \\dots, 8$.\n\n1.  $k=2^0=1$ (odd): $G^1 = G$.\n2.  $k=2^1=2$ (even): $G^2 = \\langle r^{\\gcd(2, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n3.  $k=2^2=4$ (even): $G^4 = \\langle r^{\\gcd(4, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n4.  $k=2^3=8$ (even): $G^8 = \\langle r^{\\gcd(8, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$.\n5.  $k=2^4=16$ (even): $G^{16} = \\langle r^{\\gcd(16, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$.\n6.  $k=2^5=32$ (even): $G^{32} = \\langle r^{\\gcd(32, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$.\n7.  $k=2^6=64$ (even): $G^{64} = \\langle r^{\\gcd(64, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$.\n8.  $k=2^7=128$ (even): $G^{128} = \\langle r^{\\gcd(128, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$.\n9.  $k=2^8=256$ (even): $G^{256} = \\langle r^{\\gcd(256, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n\nThe set of power subgroups is $\\{ G, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\}$.\n\nTo confirm they are all distinct, we can check their orders:\n*   $|G| = 512 = 2^9$\n*   $|\\langle r^2 \\rangle| = 256 / \\gcd(2, 256) = 128 = 2^7$\n*   $|\\langle r^4 \\rangle| = 256 / 4 = 64 = 2^6$\n*   $|\\langle r^8 \\rangle| = 256 / 8 = 32 = 2^5$\n*   $|\\langle r^{16} \\rangle| = 256 / 16 = 16 = 2^4$\n*   $|\\langle r^{32} \\rangle| = 256 / 32 = 8 = 2^3$\n*   $|\\langle r^{64} \\rangle| = 256 / 64 = 4 = 2^2$\n*   $|\\langle r^{128} \\rangle| = 256 / 128 = 2 = 2^1$\n*   $|\\{1\\}| = 1 = 2^0$\n\nSince all the orders are different, the 9 subgroups in the list are all distinct.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere are exactly 9 distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
