    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the given interval.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n*   **System:** A particle is confined to a one-dimensional box of length `a`. The potential is zero inside the box (from x=0 to x=a) and infinite outside.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the second energy eigenstate, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the probability of finding the particle within the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Quantum Mechanics Principles**\n*   **Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n    For the `n = 2` state, the wavefunction is:\n    `ψ₂(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a position `x` is given by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, `|ψ_n(x)|²`.\n    `P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n*   **Probability in an Interval:** The probability of finding the particle in the interval `[x₁, x₂]` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    `Prob(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] |ψ₂(x)|² dx`\n\n**3. Set Up the Integral**\nSubstituting the given values into the probability formula:\n`Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**4. Analyze the Integrand and the Interval**\n*   The interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is centered at `x = 0.5a`.\n*   The width of the interval is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`, which is very small (1% of the box length).\n*   For the `n=2` state, the probability density `P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)` has a node (a point of zero probability) at the center of the box, `x = 0.5a`, because `sin(2π(0.5a)/a) = sin(π) = 0`.\n*   Since the function is zero at the center of the interval, a simple approximation like `Prob ≈ P(x_center) * Δx` would yield a result of zero, which is incorrect because the probability is non-zero everywhere else in the interval. We must perform a more careful calculation.\n\n**5. Simplify the Integral using an Approximation**\nSince the interval is very small and centered around a node, we can use a Taylor series approximation for the `sin` function around that node.\n\n*   **Change of variables:** Let `u = x - 0.5a`. This shifts the origin to the center of the interval.\n    *   The new limits of integration are from `u₁ = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a` to `u₂ = 0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a`.\n    *   The term `x` in the integrand becomes `x = u + 0.5a`.\n*   **Substitute into the integrand:**\n    `sin(2πx/a) = sin(2π(u + 0.5a)/a) = sin(2πu/a + π)`\n*   **Use the trigonometric identity:** `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`. Therefore, `sin²(θ + π) = sin²(θ)`.\n    `sin²(2πu/a + π) = sin²(2πu/a)`\n*   **The integral becomes:**\n    `Prob = ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πu/a) du`\n*   **Small-angle approximation:** For the small values of `u` in our interval, the argument `z = 2πu/a` is also small. We can use the approximation `sin(z) ≈ z`.\n    `sin²(2πu/a) ≈ (2πu/a)²`\n*   **The approximated integral is:**\n    `Prob ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (2πu/a)² du`\n    `Prob ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²u²/a²) du`\n    `Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] u² du`\n\n**6. Evaluate the Approximated Integral**\n*   The integral of `u²` is `u³/3`.\n*   `Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [u³/3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`.\n*   `Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [((0.005a)³/3) - ((-0.005a)³/3)]`\n*   `Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [2 * (0.005a)³/3]`\n*   `Prob ≈ (16π² / 3a³) * (0.005)³ * a³`\n*   The `a³` terms cancel out:\n    `Prob ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³`\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n*   ` (0.005)³ = (5 x 10⁻³)³ = 125 x 10⁻⁹ `\n*   ` Prob ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹) `\n*   Using `π ≈ 3.14159`, so `π² ≈ 9.8696`.\n*   ` Prob ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹) `\n*   ` Prob ≈ (52.6379) * (125 x 10⁻⁹) `\n*   ` Prob ≈ 6579.7 * 10⁻⁹ `\n*   ` Prob ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶ `\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
