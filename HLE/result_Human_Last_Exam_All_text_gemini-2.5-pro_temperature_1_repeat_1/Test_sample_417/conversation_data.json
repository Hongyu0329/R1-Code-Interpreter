    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the chemical name to understand the molecular structure.**\n\nThe name is: `1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene`.\n\nLet's break it down:\n1.  **Central Core:** `2,4,6-trimethylbenzene`. This is a benzene ring with three methyl (-CH3) groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. This core is also known as mesitylene.\n2.  **Main Substituents:** `1,3,5-tri[...]`. At positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring, there are three identical, large substituents.\n3.  **Linker:** The substituent starts with `...methyl]`, which means each of the three main substituents is attached to the benzene ring via a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n4.  **Substituent Group:** The group attached to the methylene linker is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`.\n    *   This is a complex, chiral, bicyclic system derived from camphor, fused to a pyrazole ring.\n    *   The attachment point is the nitrogen at position 2 of the indazole ring system (`indazol-2-yl`).\n    *   The `(4S,7R)` designation specifies a single, defined stereoisomer.\n\nThe overall structure consists of a central mesitylene core with three identical, chiral \"arms\" attached to positions 1, 3, and 5 via -CH2- linkers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of the molecule.**\n\n*   The central core (1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene) has a three-fold rotational symmetry (a C3 axis) passing through the center of the ring.\n*   Since the three substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are identical, the entire molecule possesses this C3 symmetry.\n*   The presence of a C3 axis means that the three \"arms\" (the large substituents) are chemically equivalent. Also, the three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are chemically equivalent.\n*   Therefore, to find the total number of signals, we only need to count the number of unique proton environments in *one-third* of the symmetric molecule, which consists of:\n    *   One of the methyl groups on the benzene ring.\n    *   One of the -CH2- linkers.\n    *   One of the large `camphor-pyrazole` substituent groups.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of unique proton signals in each distinct part.**\n\nWe will analyze the unique proton environments, keeping in mind that protons are chemically non-equivalent if they cannot be interchanged by a symmetry operation or rapid conformational change.\n\n1.  **Central Core Methyl Groups (-CH3 at C2, C4, C6):**\n    *   There are three such methyl groups. Due to the C3 symmetry of the molecule, they are all chemically equivalent.\n    *   They will produce a single signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Contribution: 1 signal.**\n\n2.  **Methylene Linker Groups (-CH2-):**\n    *   There are three -CH2- groups, which are equivalent by C3 symmetry. So we only need to analyze one.\n    *   Each -CH2- group is attached to the chiral `camphor-pyrazole` substituent. Protons in a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, the two protons of a single -CH2- group will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   **Contribution: 2 signals.**\n\n3.  **The Camphor-Pyrazole Substituent:**\n    *   The three substituent groups are equivalent by C3 symmetry. We need to count the unique protons within one of these rigid, asymmetric units. Since the unit itself is chiral and has no internal symmetry plane, every proton in a constitutionally distinct position will be magnetically unique.\n    *   Let's list the protons in one `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol` unit:\n        *   **H at C3 (on the pyrazole ring):** This is a unique vinylic-like proton. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **H at C4 (bridgehead proton):** A unique methine proton. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **H's at C5 (-CH2- group):** Part of the rigid bicyclic system. The two protons (exo and endo) are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **H's at C6 (-CH2- group):** Similar to C5, the two protons are diastereotopic and distinct from the C5 protons. **(2 signals)**\n        *   **Methyl group at C7 (bridgehead):** A unique methyl group on a quaternary chiral center. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **Two Methyl groups at C8 (the methano bridge):** These are geminal dimethyl groups on a prochiral carbon within a chiral molecule. They are in different environments (one is \"syn\" and one is \"anti\" relative to the pyrazole ring). They are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Total Contribution from one substituent unit:** 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **9 signals.**\n\n**Step 4: Sum the signals from all parts.**\n\nTotal number of expected peaks = (Signals from core methyls) + (Signals from linkers) + (Signals from one substituent unit)\nTotal signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Symmetry:** Correctly identified the C3 molecular symmetry.\n*   **Equivalence:** Correctly determined that the three arms and three core methyls are equivalent sets.\n*   **Diastereotopicity:** Correctly identified all diastereotopic protons and groups, which is a common pitfall. This includes:\n    *   The two protons of the -CH2- linker.\n    -   The two protons of the -CH2- group at C5.\n    -   The two protons of the -CH2- group at C6.\n    -   The two methyl groups at C8.\n*   **Signal Counting:** Systematically counted all unique proton environments without double-counting or missing any. The question asks for the number of *expected* peaks, which means we assume all non-equivalent protons are resolved and do not consider accidental overlaps.\n\nThe final calculation of 12 signals is robust based on the structure and its symmetry.\n\n<<<H>>>"
