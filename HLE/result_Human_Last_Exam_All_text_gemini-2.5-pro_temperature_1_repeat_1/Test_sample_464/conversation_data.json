    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the premises of the question**\n\nWe are given two conditions about a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$:\n1.  **$f$ is a Schwartz class function.** This means $f$ belongs to the Schwartz space $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$. A function $f$ is in $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ if it is infinitely differentiable ($f \\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$) and for all non-negative integers $\\alpha, \\beta$, the quantity $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |x^\\alpha f^{(\\beta)}(x)|$ is finite. In simpler terms, $f$ and all its derivatives exist and decay faster than any inverse power of $x$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. Important consequences we will use are:\n    *   $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   $f$ is absolutely integrable, i.e., $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} |f(x)| dx < \\infty$.\n    *   For any polynomial $P(x)$, the product $P(x)f(x)$ is also absolutely integrable.\n\n2.  **All moments of $f$ are zero.** This is the condition $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$. The integral is well-defined because $x^k f(x)$ is absolutely integrable for any $k \\ge 0$.\n\nThe question is whether these two conditions together imply that the function $f$ must be identically zero, i.e., $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 2: Extend the orthogonality condition from monomials to all polynomials**\n\nThe given condition is that $f$ is \"orthogonal\" to all monomial functions $x^k$. By the linearity of the integral, we can extend this to all polynomial functions.\nLet $P(x)$ be any polynomial. It can be written as a finite sum $P(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k$ for some coefficients $a_k \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThen, the integral of $f(x)P(x)$ is:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) P(x) \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k \\right) \\, dx $$\nSince the sum is finite, we can swap the sum and the integral:\n$$ = \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k \\left( \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx \\right) $$\nFrom the given condition, each integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx$ is zero.\n$$ = \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nSo, we have shown that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) P(x) \\, dx = 0$ for any polynomial $P(x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Extend the orthogonality from polynomials to continuous functions with compact support**\n\nThe next step is to show that $f$ is orthogonal to any continuous function with compact support, denoted $\\phi \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$.\nLet $\\phi$ be such a function. Since its support is compact, there exists a real number $A > 0$ such that $\\phi(x) = 0$ for all $|x| > A$.\nThe core tool here is the **Weierstrass Approximation Theorem**, which states that any continuous function on a closed interval $[a, b]$ can be uniformly approximated by polynomials. For our function $\\phi$ on the interval $[-A, A]$, this means that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial $P(x)$ such that $|\\phi(x) - P(x)| < \\epsilon$ for all $x \\in [-A, A]$.\n\nNow we consider the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx$.\n$$ \\left| \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx \\right| = \\left| \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx - \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) P(x) \\, dx \\right| $$\nWe can subtract the second term because we know from Step 2 that it is zero.\n$$ = \\left| \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (\\phi(x) - P(x)) \\, dx \\right| $$\nSince $\\phi(x)$ is zero outside $[-A, A]$, and for $x \\in [-A, A]$ we have a polynomial approximation $P(x)$, the integral is effectively over $[-A, A]$.\n$$ = \\left| \\int_{-A}^A f(x) (\\phi(x) - P(x)) \\, dx \\right| $$\nUsing the triangle inequality for integrals:\n$$ \\le \\int_{-A}^A |f(x)| |\\phi(x) - P(x)| \\, dx $$\nNow, we use the uniform approximation from the Weierstrass theorem. We can choose $P(x)$ such that $|\\phi(x) - P(x)| < \\epsilon'$ for all $x \\in [-A, A]$.\n$$ < \\int_{-A}^A |f(x)| \\epsilon' \\, dx = \\epsilon' \\int_{-A}^A |f(x)| \\, dx $$\nSince $f$ is a Schwartz function, it is absolutely integrable, so $C_A = \\int_{-A}^A |f(x)| \\, dx$ is a finite constant. The inequality becomes:\n$$ \\left| \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx \\right| < \\epsilon' C_A $$\nSince we can make $\\epsilon'$ arbitrarily small (by choosing a better polynomial approximation), the non-negative value on the left-hand side must be zero.\nTherefore, we have established that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $\\phi \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude that f must be the zero function**\n\nWe have shown that $f$ is orthogonal to all continuous functions with compact support. We also know that $f$ itself is a continuous function because it is a Schwartz function. This is sufficient to prove that $f$ must be identically zero.\n\nWe argue by contradiction. Assume that $f$ is not identically zero. Then there must exist some point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_0) \\neq 0$.\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume $f(x_0) > 0$.\nSince $f$ is continuous, there must be a small interval around $x_0$, say $(x_0 - \\delta, x_0 + \\delta)$ for some $\\delta > 0$, where $f(x)$ remains positive. So, $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in (x_0 - \\delta, x_0 + \\delta)$.\n\nNow, we can construct a function $\\phi \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$ (a \"bump function\") with the following properties:\n*   The support of $\\phi$ is contained within the interval $(x_0 - \\delta, x_0 + \\delta)$.\n*   $\\phi(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$.\n*   $\\phi(x)$ is not identically zero.\n\nConsider the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx$. The integrand $f(x)\\phi(x)$ has the following properties:\n*   Outside the interval $(x_0 - \\delta, x_0 + \\delta)$, $\\phi(x) = 0$, so the integrand is 0.\n*   Inside the interval $(x_0 - \\delta, x_0 + \\delta)$, both $f(x)$ and $\\phi(x)$ are non-negative. Since neither is identically zero in this interval, their product is a non-negative continuous function that is strictly positive on some subinterval.\n\nThe integral of a non-negative continuous function which is not identically zero must be strictly positive.\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx = \\int_{x_0 - \\delta}^{x_0 + \\delta} f(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx > 0 $$\nThis contradicts our finding from Step 3, which was that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\phi(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all choices of $\\phi \\in C_c(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that there exists an $x_0$ with $f(x_0) \\neq 0$ must be false. This means $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nYes, if a Schwartz class function $f$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function."
