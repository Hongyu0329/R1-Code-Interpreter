    "An analysis of the question is as follows, leading to the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the term \"Generalized Markov Number\" and its connection to continued fractions.**\n    The classical Markov numbers are integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$. These numbers are deeply connected to the theory of Diophantine approximation and the Lagrange spectrum. The theory has been generalized to associate a \"Markov number\" $m_{p/q}$ with any rational number $p/q$. This generalization involves constructing a specific quadratic irrational number from the continued fraction of $p/q$. The question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with\" $m_{p/q}$, which is the continued fraction of this constructed quadratic irrationality.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Compute the continued fraction of the rational number 4/7.**\n    We use the Euclidean algorithm to find the continued fraction expansion of $4/7$.\n    *   $7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\implies 7/4 = 1 + 3/4$\n    *   $4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\implies 4/3 = 1 + 1/3$\n    *   $3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\implies 3/1 = 3 + 0$\n    The sequence of quotients gives the coefficients of the continued fraction.\n    Therefore, $\\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + 1/3}}$.\n    In compact notation, this is $4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]$.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Construct the associated periodic continued fraction.**\n    The standard procedure to find the quadratic irrationality associated with a rational number $p/q = [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$ in the context of the Markov and Lagrange spectra is to create a new, purely periodic continued fraction with a palindromic period.\n    *   Let the sequence of coefficients for the fractional part of $4/7$ be $W = (1, 1, 3)$.\n    *   Find the reverse of this sequence: $W^R = (3, 1, 1)$.\n    *   Create the palindromic sequence by concatenating $W$ and $W^R$: $S = W W^R = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)$.\n    *   This sequence $S$ forms the repeating block of the associated continued fraction.\n\n4.  **Step 3: State the final continued fraction.**\n    The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$ is the one whose periodic part is the sequence $S$ constructed in the previous step, and whose integer part is 0.\n    Thus, the continued fraction is $[0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]$.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   The term \"generalized Markov number\" can have slightly different definitions in various mathematical contexts. However, the connection to a quadratic irrationality constructed from the rational's continued fraction is a central and recurring theme. The palindromic construction ($WW^R$) is standard in the study of the Lagrange and Markov spectra.\n*   The question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with\" the number, not the continued fraction of the number $m_{4/7}$ itself. The number $m_{4/7}$ is a rational number (in some definitions, it is 17), and its own continued fraction would be simple (e.g., $[17]$), which would not be a meaningful answer in this context. The question is about the defining structure.\n*   The calculation of the continued fraction for $4/7$ must be accurate, as it forms the basis for the entire construction. The Euclidean algorithm is the standard and most reliable method.\n*   The construction of the palindromic period $WW^R$ must be done correctly by concatenating the original sequence of coefficients (from the fractional part) and its reverse.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\nFollowing the steps outlined above:\n1.  The continued fraction of $4/7$ is $[0; 1, 1, 3]$.\n2.  The sequence of coefficients is $W = (1, 1, 3)$.\n3.  The reversed sequence is $W^R = (3, 1, 1)$.\n4.  The palindromic period is $S = WW^R = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)$.\n5.  The final associated continued fraction is $[0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]$.\n\n>>> $[0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]$"
