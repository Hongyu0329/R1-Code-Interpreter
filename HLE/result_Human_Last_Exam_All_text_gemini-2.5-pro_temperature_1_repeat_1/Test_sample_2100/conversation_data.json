    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe first clue is a quote from the poet Andrei Voznesensky: \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This is a poetic description of a historical figure. The term \"sailor\" suggests an explorer or navigator, and \"joy-discovering\" implies his discoveries were significant and perhaps romanticized. This points towards a figure known for his sea voyages and a compelling personal story.\n\n**Careful Point:** This is a poetic phrase, not a literal job title. The man might have been a diplomat, merchant, or officer whose duties involved extensive sea travel.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nVoznesensky also wrote, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This is a very specific and crucial clue. It indicates that at the time the poet was writing, the burial site of this \"sailor\" was unknown or had been lost.\n\n**Careful Point:** This narrows down the candidates significantly. We are looking for a historical Russian explorer whose grave was lost for a long period.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the first two clues.**\nBoth quotes are famously associated with Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (Юнона и Авось), first staged in 1981. The opera tells the tragic love story of a Russian explorer and a Spanish governor's daughter in California. The protagonist of this opera is the man we are looking for. The character is Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The lines are from the final aria, where the spirit of Rezanov's lover sings to him, lamenting that even his final resting place is unknown.\n\n**Careful Point:** Identifying the work (\"Juno and Avos\") is the key that links the poetic description to a specific historical person.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third clue.**\nThe third clue states, \"The answer to this question [Where is your grave?] emerged in the late 1980s.\" This tells us that the mystery of the man's lost grave was solved, or at least significantly clarified, during that specific time period.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must verify this fact for our candidate, Nikolai Rezanov.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize all clues and verify the facts.**\n*   **Candidate:** Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764-1807), a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. His story fits the description of a \"sailor\" due to his voyage across the Pacific to California.\n*   **Lost Grave:** Rezanov died in the city of Krasnoyarsk in Siberia while returning to St. Petersburg. He was buried at the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. In the 1930s-1950s, the Soviet government demolished the cathedral and built over the cemetery, completely destroying it and losing the exact location of Rezanov's grave. This perfectly matches the line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n*   **Discovery:** The huge popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" created immense public interest in Rezanov's fate. During the period of Glasnost in the late 1980s, historians and local enthusiasts in Krasnoyarsk began actively researching the location of the old cathedral and cemetery. This public and scholarly effort to \"find the answer\" indeed began in the late 1980s, leading to the eventual placement of a memorial monument on the presumed site.\n\nAll three clues point directly and consistently to one person. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
