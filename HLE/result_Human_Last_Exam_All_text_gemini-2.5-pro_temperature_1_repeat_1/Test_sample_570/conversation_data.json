    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition on the Convex Domain\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The problem requires that `K` intersects every line `l_{p,q}` with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. Let `L₀` be the set of all integer vectors `u = (p,q)` such that `p` and `q` are coprime.\n\nA convex set `K` intersects a line `px + qy = 1` if and only if `K` is not contained entirely in one of the open half-planes `px + qy > 1` or `px + qy < 1`. This can be expressed using the support function of `K`, which is defined as:\n`h_K(u) = sup {<x, u> | x ∈ K}` where `<x, u>` is the dot product `px + qy`.\n\nThe condition that `K` intersects `px + qy = 1` means:\n`inf_{x ∈ K} (px + qy) ≤ 1` and `sup_{x ∈ K} (px + qy) ≥ 1`.\n\nUsing the support function, this is:\n`-h_K(-u) ≤ 1` and `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u = (p,q) ∈ L₀`.\n\nA crucial point is that if `u = (p,q) ∈ L₀`, then its negative `-u = (-p,-q)` is also in `L₀` because `gcd(-p, -q) = gcd(p,q) = 1`.\nSo, the two conditions `-h_K(-u) ≤ 1` and `h_K(u) ≥ 1` must hold for all `u ∈ L₀`. This is equivalent to the single, stronger condition:\n`h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ L₀`.\n\n### Step 2: Symmetrization of the Domain\n\nThe area of a convex domain does not change when it is translated. We are looking for the minimal area, so we can consider properties of the optimal domain. Let `K` be a convex domain satisfying the condition. Consider its Blaschke symmetral, `K_B = (K - K) / 2 = (1/2){x - y | x, y ∈ K}`. `K_B` has the following properties:\n1.  `K_B` is a centrally symmetric convex domain (symmetric with respect to the origin).\n2.  `Area(K_B) ≥ Area(K)`.\n3.  The support function of `K_B` is `h_{K_B}(u) = (h_K(u) + h_K(-u)) / 2`.\n\nIf `K` satisfies the condition `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ L₀`, then `h_K(-u) ≥ 1` also holds for all `u ∈ L₀`. Therefore, for `K_B`:\n`h_{K_B}(u) = (h_K(u) + h_K(-u)) / 2 ≥ (1 + 1) / 2 = 1`.\nSo, `K_B` also satisfies the condition. Since `Area(K_B) ≥ Area(K)`, any domain `K` that minimizes the area must have an area no larger than its symmetral `K_B`. This implies that the minimal area will be achieved by a centrally symmetric domain. We can therefore restrict our search to centrally symmetric convex domains `K`.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Polar Body\n\nFor a centrally symmetric convex domain `K`, the condition simplifies to `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ L₀`. Let's consider the polar body of `K`, defined as:\n`K° = {y | <x, y> ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K}`.\n\nThe support function `h_K` and the polar body `K°` are related. A vector `y` is in `K°` if and only if `h_K(y) ≤ 1`.\nThe condition `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ L₀` means that no point `u` from the set of primitive integer vectors `L₀` can be in the *interior* of `K°`. The interior of `K°` is `{y | h_K(y) < 1}`.\nSo, the problem is transformed into a question about the polar body `K°`: `K°` must be a centrally symmetric convex domain whose interior contains no primitive integer points.\n\nOur goal is to minimize `Area(K)`. This is related to maximizing `Area(K°)`.\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing the Area of the Polar Body\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible area of a centrally symmetric convex set `S` in the plane such that its interior, `int(S)`, contains no points from `L₀` (i.e., `int(S) ∩ L₀ = ∅`).\n\nA key result from the geometry of numbers states that the maximum area for such a set is 4. This maximum is achieved by the closed square `S = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\nThe interior of this square is `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)`, which contains no non-zero integer points at all, and thus no primitive integer points. The area of this square is `(1 - (-1)) × (1 - (-1)) = 2 × 2 = 4`.\nSo, for our polar body `K°`, we must have `Area(K°) ≤ 4`.\n\n### Step 5: Relating the Areas of K and K°\n\nThe areas of a convex body and its polar are related by the Blaschke-Santaló inequality. For centrally symmetric convex domains `K` in the plane, a sharper inequality known as Mahler's inequality holds:\n`Area(K) × Area(K°) ≥ 8`.\nEquality holds if and only if `K` is a parallelogram.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Minimal Area\n\nWe can now find the lower bound for the area of `K`.\nFrom Mahler's inequality: `Area(K) ≥ 8 / Area(K°)`.\nFrom Step 4, we know that `Area(K°) ≤ 4`.\nCombining these, we get:\n`Area(K) ≥ 8 / 4 = 2`.\n\nThis shows that the minimal possible area is at least 2.\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Minimum is Achievable\n\nTo show that 2 is indeed the minimal area, we must demonstrate a convex domain `K` that satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\nLet's choose `K°` to be the body of maximal area, the square `S = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n`K° = {y = (y₁, y₂) | |y₁| ≤ 1 and |y₂| ≤ 1}`.\n`Area(K°) = 4`.\nThe domain `K` is the polar of this square `S`:\n`K = S° = {x | <x, y> ≤ 1 for all y ∈ S}`.\nThe condition `<x, y> ≤ 1` for all `y` in the square is equivalent to checking the vertices of the square: `(±1, ±1)`.\n`sup_{y∈S} <x, y> = sup_{|y₁|≤1, |y₂|≤1} (x₁y₁ + x₂y₂) = |x₁| + |x₂|`.\nSo, `K = {x = (x₁, x₂) | |x₁| + |x₂| ≤ 1}`.\n\nThis domain `K` is a square with vertices at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)`. The length of its diagonal is 2, and its area is `(1/2) × 2 × 2 = 2`.\nThis domain satisfies `Area(K) × Area(K°) = 2 × 4 = 8`, which matches Mahler's inequality for parallelograms.\nWe have found a valid convex domain with an area of 2. Since we proved that the area must be at least 2, this is the minimal possible area."
