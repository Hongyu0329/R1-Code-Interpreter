    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the primary evolutionary mechanism that explains two outcomes for genes that have been duplicated in a eukaryotic genome: 1) **Retention**, meaning the extra copy is not lost or silenced, and 2) **Divergence**, meaning the two gene copies evolve to become different from each other.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Fate of Duplicate Genes:** When a gene is duplicated, there are two identical copies. Initially, one copy is redundant. This redundancy means it's not subject to strong purifying selection, so mutations can accumulate more freely than in a single-copy gene. The most common fate is that one copy will accumulate inactivating mutations and become a non-functional **pseudogene**, which is eventually lost from the genome. The question is about the mechanisms that *prevent* this from happening and lead to both copies being kept as functional (or at least useful) parts of the genome.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a DNA repair mechanism where a sequence of one gene copy is used as a template to \"correct\" the sequence of the other homologous copy. This process makes the two copies *more similar* or identical. Therefore, it works *against* divergence and cannot be the primary mechanism for it.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a duplicate gene becomes non-functional. While this is a very common outcome and involves sequence divergence, it results in the *loss* of a functional gene, not its *retention*. The question asks for a mechanism of retention.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the second copy is free to accumulate mutations. By chance, these mutations may result in a completely new, beneficial function. Natural selection would then favor the retention of this new gene. This model explains both retention and divergence. However, it relies on the occurrence of a relatively rare event—a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation—happening before a much more common disabling mutation occurs.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the original, ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple different tissues/times (i.e., it had multiple \"subfunctions\"). After duplication, each copy can accumulate mutations that disable different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 might lose function A but keep function B, while copy 2 loses function B but keeps function A. Now, both gene copies are required to perform the full set of the original ancestral gene's functions. This \"complementation\" ensures that both copies are retained by selection. This process inherently involves divergence as the two copies accumulate different disabling mutations. Because loss-of-function mutations are much more common than gain-of-function mutations, this is considered a very probable and common pathway for preserving duplicate genes immediately following a duplication event.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary term describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into multiple species that occupy different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material for such an event, adaptive radiation itself is a pattern of speciation, not a molecular mechanism governing the fate of genes within a genome. It operates at the wrong level of biological organization.\n\n4.  **Compare the Viable Options (C and D):** Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the **\"most likely\"** mechanism. Subfunctionalization relies on the partitioning of existing functions through common degenerative mutations. Neofunctionalization relies on the evolution of a brand-new function through rare beneficial mutations. Because the mutational basis for subfunctionalization (loss-of-function) is far more frequent than for neofunctionalization (gain-of-function), many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization to be a more common and therefore more likely mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicate genes. It provides a stable state where both copies are protected from being lost, allowing for longer-term divergence that might even lead to later neofunctionalization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSubfunctionalization provides the most probable and common pathway for preventing the loss of a new gene duplicate while allowing it to diverge from its partner. It relies on frequent loss-of-function mutations to make both copies essential, thereby ensuring their retention.\n\n<<<D>>>"
