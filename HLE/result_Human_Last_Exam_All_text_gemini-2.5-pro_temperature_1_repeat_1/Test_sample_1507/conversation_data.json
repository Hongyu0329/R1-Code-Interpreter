    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object - The Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is defined by its Schläfli symbol {3, 5/2}, indicating that it is composed of triangular faces ({3}), with five faces meeting at each vertex in a pentagrammic arrangement ({5/2}). It has 20 large, self-intersecting triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret \"Outer-Hull\" and \"Visible Triangles\"**\nThe question asks for the triangulation of the \"outer-hull\", which it clarifies as \"the number of visible triangles from the outside\". This is a crucial point. It does not refer to the *convex hull* of the great icosahedron.\n\n*   The **convex hull** of the vertices of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces. If the question were about the convex hull, the answer would be 20.\n*   The **\"outer-hull\"** or visible surface is the boundary of the solid volume enclosed by the faces of the great icosahedron. It's what you would see if you were looking at a physical model of the object from a distance. This surface is different from the convex hull because the great icosahedron has \"spikes\" that protrude beyond its convex hull.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the Visible Surface**\nThe 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are located at the same positions as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. At each of these 12 vertices, a \"spike\" or pyramid juts out. We need to determine the shape of these pyramids and how many faces they contribute to the visible surface.\n\n*   As the Schläfli symbol {3, 5/2} tells us, five triangular faces meet at each vertex.\n*   These five faces form a pentagonal pyramid at each of the 12 vertices. The apex of each pyramid is a vertex of the great icosahedron.\n*   The sides of these pyramids are the parts of the great icosahedron's faces that are visible from the outside.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Triangles**\nWe need to count the total number of triangular faces that make up the sides of these pyramids.\n\n*   Each pyramid is a pentagonal pyramid. A pentagonal pyramid has 5 triangular side faces.\n*   There are 12 such pyramids, one for each vertex of the underlying icosahedral structure.\n*   Therefore, the total number of visible triangles is the number of vertices multiplied by the number of triangular faces per pyramid.\n\nCalculation: 12 vertices × 5 triangular faces/vertex = 60 triangles.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Result**\nThe visible surface of the great icosahedron forms a new, non-convex but non-self-intersecting polyhedron, sometimes called the final stellation of the icosahedron or the echidnahedron. This polyhedron has 60 triangular faces. This is the minimal number of triangles required because these faces are the fundamental flat components of the visible surface. You cannot represent this specific polyhedral surface with fewer triangles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe minimal number of triangles needed to form the visible outer surface of the great icosahedron is 60.\n\n<<<60>>>"
