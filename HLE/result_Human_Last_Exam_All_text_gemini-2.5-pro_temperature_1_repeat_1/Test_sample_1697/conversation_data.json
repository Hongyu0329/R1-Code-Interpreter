    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to an amide functional group, -C(=O)NH₂.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) replace the two hydrogens on the nitrogen atom of the amide group, making it a tertiary amide: -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is attached to position 3 of the benzene ring, assuming the carbon atom bearing the amide group is position 1.\n\nThe structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at position 1 and the dimethylamino group at position 3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Reagents: sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF)**\n\n*   **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium)**: This is a very strong organolithium base. Its primary role in this context is to deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule.\n*   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine)**: This is a chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li⁺). It complexes with sec-BuLi, breaking up its aggregates and increasing its basicity and reactivity. This combination (sec-BuLi/TMEDA) is a classic reagent system for a reaction called **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**.\n*   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran)**: This is the solvent, a common choice for organometallic reactions.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Identifying Directing Groups and the Site of Metalation**\nThe DoM reaction involves the deprotonation (lithiation) of a C-H bond that is *ortho* (adjacent) to a \"directing group\". The directing group coordinates to the lithium ion, bringing the butyl base close to the ortho proton, facilitating its removal.\n\nOur starting material has two directing groups:\n1.  **N,N-diethylcarboxamide (-CONEt₂)**: The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base and coordinates strongly to lithium. This is one of the most powerful directing groups for ortho-metalation.\n2.  **Dimethylamino (-NMe₂)**: The nitrogen atom's lone pair can also coordinate to lithium, making it a good directing group, though generally less powerful than the carboxamide group.\n\nNow, let's identify the potential sites for deprotonation (the C-H positions ortho to these groups):\n*   **Position 2**: This position is ortho to the strong directing carboxamide group AND ortho to the dimethylamino group.\n*   **Position 6**: This position is ortho to the carboxamide group only.\n*   **Position 4**: This position is ortho to the dimethylamino group only.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Regioselectivity**\nThe reaction will be highly regioselective. The most acidic proton will be removed.\n*   The carboxamide group is a stronger director than the amino group.\n*   Position 2 is activated by **both** directing groups. This is a **synergistic effect**. The lithium ion can be chelated by both the amide oxygen and the amino nitrogen, forming a stable six-membered ring intermediate. This makes the proton at C-2 significantly more acidic and kinetically easier to remove than any other proton on the ring.\nTherefore, the lithiation will occur selectively at position 2.\n\nThe product of the first step is the aryllithium intermediate: **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Reagent: Methyl Iodide, CH₃I)**\n\n*   **Methyl Iodide (CH₃I)**: This is an electrophilic source of a methyl group. The carbon atom in CH₃I is electrophilic because it is bonded to the more electronegative iodine atom.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The aryllithium intermediate formed in Step 1 is a potent nucleophile (essentially a carbanion at position 2). It will attack the electrophilic carbon of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Quenching Reaction**\nThe nucleophilic carbon at position 2 of the benzene ring attacks the methyl group of CH₃I. The C-I bond breaks, and iodide (I⁻) leaves as the leaving group. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the benzene ring (at C-2) and the methyl group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe overall transformation is the replacement of the hydrogen atom at position 2 with a methyl group.\n*   Starting material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   Final Product: A methyl group is added at position 2.\n\nThe name of the final compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
