    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The primary task is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix, which is denoted as \\(A\\).\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Analyze the Contextual Information:** The question mentions this matrix is the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n    *   The matrix \\(A\\) is explicitly defined. Therefore, any additional terminology or parameters are contextual and do not change the matrix itself or the calculation required.\n    *   The value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) and the term \"Markov quiver\" do not affect the entries of the matrix \\(A\\). The problem is self-contained to the computation of \\( \\det(A) \\).\n\n3.  **Choose a Method for Calculation:** There are several standard methods to compute the determinant of a matrix. We can use:\n    *   The formula for a 3x3 determinant (Sarrus' rule or cofactor expansion).\n    *   Row reduction to transform the matrix into an upper triangular form.\n    *   Finding the eigenvalues of the matrix.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** It is crucial not to get distracted or confused by the terms \"Markov quiver\" or the parameter \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\). The problem's core is the determinant calculation of the explicitly provided matrix.\n*   **Arithmetic Accuracy:** Determinant calculations involve several multiplication and addition/subtraction steps. Care must be taken to avoid simple arithmetic errors.\n*   **Matrix Properties:** Observing properties of the matrix can often simplify the calculation. For matrix \\(A\\), notice that the sum of the elements in each row is zero.\n    *   Row 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Row 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Row 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n    This property has a direct implication for the determinant.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will use two different methods to ensure the result is correct.\n\n**Method 1: Using Cofactor Expansion**\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\( M = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\) is \\( \\det(M) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\).\n\nFor our matrix \\( A \\):\n*   \\(a=2, b=-1, c=-1\\)\n*   \\(d=-1, e=2, f=-1\\)\n*   \\(g=-1, h=-1, i=2\\)\n\nSubstitute these values:\n\\( \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nCalculate the determinants of the 2x2 matrices:\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\nSubstitute these back into the main formula:\n\\( \\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3) \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\)\n\\( \\det(A) = 0 \\)\n\n**Method 2: Using Row Operations**\n\nA property of determinants is that adding a multiple of one row to another row does not change the value of the determinant.\n\nLet's add the second and third rows to the first row (\\(R_1 \\to R_1 + R_2 + R_3\\)).\nThe new first row becomes:\n\\( [ (2 + (-1) + (-1)), (-1 + 2 + (-1)), (-1 + (-1) + 2) ] = [0, 0, 0] \\)\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n\\[\nA' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of a matrix with a row of zeros is always zero.\nTherefore, \\( \\det(A) = \\det(A') = 0 \\).\n\nThis method is very efficient and confirms the result from the first method.\n\nThe determinant of the given adjacency matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
