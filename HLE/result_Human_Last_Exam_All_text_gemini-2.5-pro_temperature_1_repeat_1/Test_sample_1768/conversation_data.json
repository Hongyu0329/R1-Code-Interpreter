    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core problem and key information.**\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is: `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\nThe crucial piece of information is that this sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**. An ORF is a continuous sequence of codons that can be translated into a protein. It starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Because this segment is from the middle, it should not contain any internal stop codons. The stop codons in DNA are TAA, TAG, and TGA.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the three possible reading frames.**\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different \"frames\" on the forward strand, depending on which nucleotide you start with.\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide (`g`).\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide (`g`).\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide (`a`).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each reading frame for stop codons.**\nWe will translate the sequence in each of the three frames and check if any of them contain a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA). The frame that is \"open\" (i.e., has no stop codons) will be the correct one.\n\n*   **Frame 1 Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence grouping: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt ...`\n    *   The fifth codon is `tag`.\n    *   **Result:** `tag` is a stop codon. Therefore, Frame 1 is not the correct reading frame for the middle of an ORF.\n\n*   **Frame 2 Analysis:**\n    *   We ignore the first nucleotide and start with the second.\n    *   Sequence grouping: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The last nucleotide 'c' is ignored as it doesn't form a full codon).\n    *   Translation of codons:\n        *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n        *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n        *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n        *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n        *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n        *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n        *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n        *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n        *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n        *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n        *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n        *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n        *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n        *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n        *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n        *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n        *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n        *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n        *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n        *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n        *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n        *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n        *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n        *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n        *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n    *   **Result:** No stop codons are found in this frame. This is a valid ORF segment.\n\n*   **Frame 3 Analysis:**\n    *   We ignore the first two nucleotides and start with the third.\n    *   Sequence grouping: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga ...`\n    *   The eighth codon is `tga`.\n    *   **Result:** `tga` is a stop codon. Therefore, Frame 3 is not the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and provide the final answer.**\nBased on the analysis, only Frame 2 produces a continuous amino acid sequence without any stop codons. This makes it the correct reading frame for a sequence taken from the middle of an ORF. The translated protein sequence is derived from this frame.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n*   **Frame:** Frame 2\n*   **Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLLPYPNNLNSVLALERLEKW\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLLPYPNNLNSVLALERLEKW>>>"
