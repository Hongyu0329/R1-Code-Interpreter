    "An analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity is performed step-by-step below.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0`: This is a single assignment operation.\n    *   `x := n`: This is a single assignment operation.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: This involves one division and one floor operation.\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc`: This involves one multiplication and one subtraction.\n    *   All operations in this step are basic arithmetic or assignment operations. Assuming these operations take a constant amount of time, the total time for Step 1 is constant. We denote this as O(1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the `while` loop (Step 2):**\n    *   The complexity of the algorithm is determined by this loop, as it is the only part that does not run in constant time. To find its complexity, we need to determine the cost of a single iteration and the number of times the loop executes.\n    *   **Cost of a single iteration (Step 2.1):**\n        *   `i := i + 1`: One addition, one assignment.\n        *   `x := q`: One assignment.\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One division, one floor operation.\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc`: One multiplication, one subtraction.\n        *   Each iteration consists of a fixed number of basic operations. Therefore, the time complexity of a single iteration is constant, O(1).\n    *   **Number of iterations:**\n        *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The value of `q` is updated in each iteration.\n        *   Let's trace the value of `x`, which determines `q`. Initially, `x` is `n`.\n        *   In the first iteration, `x` is updated to `q`, which was `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   In the second iteration, `x` is updated to the new `q`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations of the loop, the value of `x` (which is the variable `q` from the (`k-1`)-th iteration) will be `⌊n/c^k⌋`.\n        *   The loop's condition `q > 0` is checked at the beginning of each iteration. At the start of the `(k+1)`-th iteration, the value being tested is the `q` calculated at the end of the `k`-th iteration, which is `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n        *   The loop terminates when `q ≤ 0`. This happens when `⌊n/c^k⌋ = 0` for some `k`. This condition is met when `n/c^k < 1`, which is equivalent to `n < c^k`.\n        *   The number of iterations is the number of times we can divide `n` by `c` before the integer quotient becomes 0. This is directly related to the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n`.\n        *   The number of digits is `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The loop runs `k-1` times. The number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n        *   For example, if `n=100` and `c=10`, `log_10(100) = 2`. The digits are `a_0, a_1, a_2`. The loop runs for `i=1` and `i=2`, so it runs 2 times. `⌊log_10(100)⌋ = 2`.\n        *   Thus, the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity `T(n, c)` is the sum of the time for the initialization part and the loop part.\n    *   `T(n, c)` = (Time for Step 1) + (Number of iterations) × (Time per iteration)\n    *   `T(n, c) = O(1) + ⌊log_c(n)⌋ × O(1)`\n    *   `T(n, c) = O(1) + O(log_c(n))`\n    *   In Big-O notation, we take the fastest-growing term, which is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Model of Computation:** This analysis assumes the standard RAM model where basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on numbers that fit in a single machine word take O(1) time. For arbitrarily large numbers (bignums), these operations are not O(1), and the complexity would be higher.\n*   **Base of Logarithm:** The complexity is `O(log_c(n))`. According to the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log_k(n) / log_k(c)` for any base `k`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_k(c)` is also a constant. In Big-O notation, constant factors are omitted. Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n*   **Input Size:** The complexity is logarithmic with respect to the *value* of the input `n`. If we consider the input *size* `s` (the number of bits needed to represent `n`, so `s ≈ log_2(n)`), the complexity `O(log n)` is `O(s)`, which is linear in the size of the input. However, for algorithms involving numbers, it is conventional to express the complexity in terms of the magnitude of the number itself.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The loop divides the number `n` by the base `c` repeatedly until the result is 0. The number of such divisions is proportional to the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`. Each iteration of the loop takes constant time. Therefore, the total computational time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
