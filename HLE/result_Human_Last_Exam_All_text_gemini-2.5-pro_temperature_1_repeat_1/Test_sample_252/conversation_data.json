    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\". A spectral volume is a three-dimensional dataset with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (λ, wavelength). This is often called a data cube. Capturing this from a single image means it's a \"snapshot\" technique.\n\n2.  **Understand the Method:** The method specified is \"computed tomography\" (CT). Standard CT (like in medical imaging) reconstructs a 3D object by taking multiple 2D projection images from different angles around the object. An algorithm then uses these projections to reconstruct the original 3D volume.\n\n3.  **Apply the CT Analogy to Spectroscopy (CTIS):**\n    *   **The \"Object\":** The object we want to reconstruct is the 3D spectral data cube (x, y, λ).\n    *   **The \"Projections\":** The projections are the images formed on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor).\n    *   **The \"Angles\":** In a snapshot instrument, we cannot physically rotate a source/detector. Instead, the different \"viewing angles\" are provided by using a diffraction grating. A diffraction grating splits the incoming light into multiple copies, called diffraction orders. The central, undiffracted copy is the \"zeroth order\". The other orders (+1, -1, +2, -2, etc.) are dispersed, meaning the light is spread out by wavelength. Each of these diffraction orders acts as a unique projection of the 3D data cube onto the 2D detector.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Number of Gratings:**\n\n    *   **Zero Gratings:** Without any grating, there is no diffraction and no spectral dispersion. You would only capture a standard 2D panchromatic image (all wavelengths summed at each pixel). It is impossible to recover the spectral (λ) information from this. So, zero is not enough.\n\n    *   **One Grating:** Let's consider a standard one-dimensional (1D) diffraction grating (like a series of parallel lines). This grating will disperse light along a single axis, perpendicular to the lines of the grating. This will create a row of diffraction orders on the detector: a central 0th order and a series of dispersed orders (+1, -1, +2, etc.) along a line.\n        *   **Careful Point:** In the language of computed tomography, this provides projections only along a single axis. Think of a medical CT scanner trying to reconstruct a body using only X-rays from the front and the back. This provides very limited information and is insufficient to uniquely and accurately reconstruct the 2D cross-section, let alone a 3D volume. The reconstruction problem is \"ill-posed\" or \"underdetermined\". Therefore, a single 1D grating is not sufficient.\n\n    *   **Two Gratings:** To overcome the limitation of a 1D grating, we need projections from multiple, non-collinear directions. This can be achieved by using a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating. A 2D grating is physically equivalent to superimposing two 1D gratings, typically oriented at 90 degrees to each other (a \"crossed grating\").\n        *   This 2D grating produces a 2D array of diffraction orders on the detector (e.g., orders at positions (0,0), (±1,0), (0,±1), (±1,±1), etc.).\n        *   These orders represent projections of the data cube from multiple different directions (e.g., horizontal dispersion, vertical dispersion, diagonal dispersion).\n        *   **Careful Point:** This rich set of projections provides enough information for the computed tomography algorithm to successfully reconstruct the 3D spectral data cube. The minimum number of *fundamental dispersion patterns* required to make the tomography problem well-posed is two (e.g., one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction). These two fundamental patterns are typically fabricated into a single optical element, but the principle relies on the information provided by two distinct gratings.\n\n    *   **More than Two Gratings:** While systems could be designed with more complex gratings (equivalent to superimposing three or more gratings) to improve reconstruction quality, the *minimum* number required to make the system fundamentally work is two.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA single 1D grating provides projections along only one axis, which is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction. To get the necessary variety of projection \"angles,\" dispersion is needed in at least two different directions. This requires the functional equivalent of two crossed 1D gratings. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings (interpreted as fundamental 1D grating patterns) necessary for the technique is two.\n\n<<<B>>>"
