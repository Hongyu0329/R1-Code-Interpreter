    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Problem\nLet `S` be the unit square, `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\nWe are given two subsets of the plane, `A` and `B`, with the following properties:\n1.  `A` is a closed set.\n2.  `B` is a closed set.\n3.  `A` is a connected set.\n4.  `B` is a connected set.\n5.  Their union is the unit square: `A U B = S`.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection of these two sets, `A ∩ B`.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Thoughts and Simple Cases\n- If `A = S`, then `B` must also be `S` to satisfy the conditions (since `B` is a closed subset of `A`, and for `A U B = S`, `B` must contain all points of `S`). In this case, `A ∩ B = S`, which has 1 connected component.\n- If `A` is the left half of the square `[0, 1/2] x [0, 1]` and `B` is the right half `[1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`, all conditions are met. Their intersection is the line segment `{1/2} x [0, 1]`, which has 1 connected component.\n- If we try to construct an intersection with more than one component, we run into difficulties. For example, if we want the intersection to be two separate points, `A` must connect these points, and `B` must also connect these points. The paths used for connection often end up in the intersection, connecting the components.\n\n### Step 3: An Incorrect Argument Using Homology\nA common tool in topology for this kind of problem is the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. For singular homology, this sequence relates the homology groups of `A`, `B`, `A U B`, and `A ∩ B`. A simplified analysis of this sequence for path-connected spaces leads to the conclusion that `A ∩ B` must be path-connected, and therefore have only 1 connected component.\n\nHowever, this argument has a subtle flaw:\n1.  The sets `A` and `B` are given as **connected**, but they are not necessarily **path-connected**. A connected set is not always path-connected (e.g., the topologist's sine curve). Homology theory is built upon paths (simplices), so the argument only proves that the intersection is path-connected.\n2.  Even if the sets were path-connected, the standard Mayer-Vietoris sequence requires certain \"tameness\" conditions on the sets (`A` and `B` must form an \"excisive couple\"), which are not guaranteed here.\n\nSo, we cannot rely on this argument and must seek another method.\n\n### Step 4: Using a Known Topological Theorem\nThe problem can be solved by relating it to a known result in plane topology. We can embed our entire setup into the 2-sphere, `S^2`.\n\n1.  **Embedding in the Sphere:** Imagine the unit square `S` lying on the surface of a sphere `S^2` (e.g., think of the square as a large patch on the Earth's surface). The sets `A` and `B` are closed and connected subsets of `S`, and their union is `S`.\n\n2.  **Modifying the Sets:** We want to apply a theorem about sets whose union is the entire sphere. Let's define two new sets on `S^2`:\n    - Let `A' = A`.\n    - Let `B' = B U (S^2 \\ S)`. This is the set `B` plus the entire part of the sphere that is not the square `S`.\n\n3.  **Checking the Properties of the New Sets:**\n    - `A'` is closed and connected because `A` is.\n    - `S^2 \\ S` is topologically an open disk, so its closure `cl(S^2 \\ S)` is a closed disk. `B'` is the union of `B` and `cl(S^2 \\ S)`. Since `B` and `cl(S^2 \\ S)` are connected and they meet at the boundary of the square (`∂S`), their union `B'` is connected. `B'` is also a union of two closed sets, so it is closed.\n    - The union of the new sets is `A' U B' = A U B U (S^2 \\ S) = S U (S^2 \\ S) = S^2`.\n\n4.  **Applying Kuratowski's Theorem:** A theorem by the topologist Kazimierz Kuratowski states that if two closed connected sets on the 2-sphere have the sphere as their union, their intersection can have at most two connected components.\n    Applying this to `A'` and `B'`, we find that `A' ∩ B'` can have at most 2 components.\n\n5.  **Relating Back to the Original Intersection:** Let's find the intersection of our new sets:\n    `A' ∩ B' = A ∩ (B U (S^2 \\ S)) = (A ∩ B) U (A ∩ (S^2 \\ S))`\n    Since `A` is entirely contained within `S`, its intersection with the part of the sphere outside `S` is empty. So, `A ∩ (S^2 \\ S) = ∅`.\n    Therefore, `A' ∩ B' = A ∩ B`.\n\nThis proves that our original intersection `A ∩ B` can have **at most 2 connected components**.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing an Example with Two Components\nNow we need to show that 2 components are achievable. We can construct an example within the unit square `S`.\n\n1.  **Define Set A:** Let `A` be a \"dumbbell\" shape lying entirely within the interior of the square. For instance, two small disjoint closed disks connected by a thin closed rectangle (the \"bar\" of the dumbbell). This set `A` is closed and connected.\n\n2.  **Define Set B:** Let `B` be the rest of the square. A first attempt might be `B = cl(S \\ A)`. However, `S \\ A` is not connected; it consists of the region \"inside\" the dumbbell's handle and the region \"outside\" the dumbbell. Therefore, `cl(S \\ A)` would not be connected.\n    To make `B` connected, we must add a \"bridge\". Let `B = cl(S \\ A) U P`, where `P` is a path (a simple curve) that connects the inner and outer regions of `cl(S \\ A)`. We can draw this path `P` so that it does not touch the dumbbell `A`.\n\n3.  **Check the Properties:**\n    - `A` is closed and connected by construction.\n    - `B` is now the union of the two components of `cl(S \\ A)` and a path connecting them, so `B` is connected. It is also closed.\n    - `A U B = A U cl(S \\ A) U P = S U P`. Since `P` is a path within `S`, `S U P = S`.\n    - The intersection is `A ∩ B = A ∩ (cl(S \\ A) U P) = (A ∩ cl(S \\ A)) U (A ∩ P)`.\n        - The intersection `A ∩ cl(S \\ A)` is precisely the boundary of `A`, which is `∂A`. The boundary of the dumbbell shape consists of two disjoint circles (the boundaries of the two disks). This has two components.\n        - Since we chose the bridge `P` to not touch `A`, `A ∩ P = ∅`.\n    - So, `A ∩ B = ∂A`, which has **2 connected components**.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe have shown that the number of components is at most 2, and we have constructed a valid example with exactly 2 components. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
