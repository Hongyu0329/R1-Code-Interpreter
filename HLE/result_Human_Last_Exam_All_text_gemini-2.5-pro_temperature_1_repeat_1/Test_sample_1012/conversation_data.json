    "An analysis of the question requires understanding the impact of quantum computing on symmetric key cryptography.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The question concerns an attack on a symmetric key by an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\" This implies we need to consider the most effective known quantum algorithms against this type of cryptography.\n\n2.  **Classical vs. Quantum Attacks on Symmetric Keys:**\n    *   **Classical Computer:** The primary attack against a symmetric cipher is a brute-force search. For a key of length 'n' bits, there are 2^n possible keys. A classical computer would, on average, need to test half of them (2^(n-1)), making the complexity of the attack O(2^n). The security level is thus considered 'n' bits. For example, AES-128 has a 128-bit security level against classical attacks.\n    *   **Quantum Computer:** The most efficient known quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric ciphers is **Grover's algorithm**. Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems like finding a specific key in a large keyspace.\n\n3.  **Impact of Grover's Algorithm:**\n    *   Instead of taking O(N) steps like a classical computer (where N = 2^n), Grover's algorithm can find the key in approximately O(sqrt(N)) steps.\n    *   For a symmetric key of length 'n', the number of quantum operations required is on the order of sqrt(2^n), which is equal to 2^(n/2).\n    *   This effectively **halves the security level** of the symmetric key. For example, a 128-bit key, which offers 128 bits of security against classical computers, only offers 128/2 = 64 bits of security against a quantum computer.\n\n4.  **Determine the Required Security Level:**\n    *   For a system to be considered secure for the foreseeable future, a security level of at least **128 bits** is the widely accepted standard. A security level of 64 bits (2^64 operations) is considered breakable with sufficient resources, even today. Therefore, a post-quantum security level of 64 bits is insufficient.\n    *   We need to find a key length 'n' such that the security level against a quantum attack is at least 128 bits.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum Key Length:**\n    *   Let 'n' be the required symmetric key length.\n    *   The post-quantum security level is n/2.\n    *   We set the desired security level: `(n / 2) >= 128`\n    *   Solving for 'n': `n >= 128 * 2`\n    *   `n >= 256`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** To achieve a 128-bit security level against an attack from a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm, a symmetric key must be at least **256 bits** long.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric:** This analysis applies only to symmetric-key algorithms. Asymmetric algorithms like RSA and ECC are broken much more effectively by Shor's algorithm, requiring a complete replacement with new post-quantum algorithms, not just a key size increase.\n*   **Optimality of Grover's Algorithm:** Grover's algorithm has been mathematically proven to be the optimal quantum solution for unstructured search, meaning a more efficient algorithm that provides more than a quadratic speedup is not believed to be possible.\n*   **\"At Least\":** The question asks for the minimum length. A 128-bit key provides only 64 bits of quantum security, which is not enough. A 256-bit key provides 128 bits of quantum security, which is considered the minimum acceptable level for long-term security. While 512-bit or 1024-bit keys would also be secure, 256 bits is the minimum required to meet the security standard.\n\nBased on this analysis, a 256-bit symmetric key is the minimum length required to be secure against a quantum computer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
