    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group ($\\Gamma$).\n\n### Step 1: Relate subgroups of index 4 to group homomorphisms\nA subgroup $H$ of index $n$ in a group $G$ gives rise to a transitive group action of $G$ on the set of left cosets $G/H$. This action is defined by a homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to S_n$, where $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ elements. The image of this homomorphism, $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$.\n\nFor our problem, we are looking for subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group $\\Gamma$. This corresponds to counting the number of equivalence classes of transitive actions of $\\Gamma$ on a set of 4 elements. The corresponding homomorphism $\\phi: \\Gamma \\to S_4$ will have a transitive image.\n\n### Step 2: Identify possible quotient groups\nThe Grigorchuk group $\\Gamma$ is a 2-group, which means every element has an order that is a power of 2. Consequently, any finite quotient of $\\Gamma$ must also be a 2-group. The image $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$ is a finite quotient of $\\Gamma$, so it must be a 2-group.\n\nWe need to identify the transitive subgroups of $S_4$ that are also 2-groups. The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are:\n*   $C_4$ (the cyclic group of order 4)\n*   $V_4$ (the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$)\n*   $D_8$ (the dihedral group of order 8)\n*   $A_4$ (the alternating group of order 12)\n*   $S_4$ (the symmetric group of order 24)\n\nOut of these, the 2-groups are $C_4$, $V_4$, and $D_8$.\nLet $H$ be a subgroup of index 4 in $\\Gamma$. Let $K = \\text{Core}(H) = \\bigcap_{g \\in \\Gamma} gHg^{-1}$ be the core of $H$. Then $K$ is a normal subgroup of $\\Gamma$, and the quotient group $\\Gamma/K$ is isomorphic to the image of the action, so $\\Gamma/K$ must be isomorphic to $C_4$, $V_4$, or $D_8$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each possible quotient group case\n\n**Case 1: $\\Gamma/K \\cong C_4$**\nA surjective homomorphism $\\Gamma \\to C_4$ must have a kernel containing the commutator subgroup $[\\Gamma, \\Gamma]$. Thus, any such homomorphism factors through the abelianization of $\\Gamma$, which is $\\Gamma_{ab} = \\Gamma/[\\Gamma, \\Gamma]$.\nIt is a known property of the Grigorchuk group that its abelianization is $\\Gamma_{ab} \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 = (C_2)^3$.\nThis group has exponent 2 (every element squared is the identity). Any quotient of $(C_2)^3$ must also have exponent at most 2. The group $C_4$ has exponent 4. Therefore, there can be no surjective homomorphism from $(C_2)^3$ to $C_4$. This means there are no normal subgroups $K$ such that $\\Gamma/K \\cong C_4$. This case is impossible.\n\n**Case 2: $\\Gamma/K \\cong D_8$**\nThis case involves a deep property of the Grigorchuk group. It can be shown (as a non-trivial result from the literature, e.g., in a paper by Grigorchuk and Nagnibeda) that any homomorphism from $\\Gamma$ to $D_8$ must map the generator $d$ to the identity element.\nLet $\\pi: \\Gamma \\to D_8$ be such a homomorphism. If $\\pi(d) = 1$, then from the relation $bcd=1$, we have $\\pi(b)\\pi(c)\\pi(d) = \\pi(b)\\pi(c) = 1$. Since $b$ and $c$ are involutions, their images $\\pi(b)$ and $\\pi(c)$ are also involutions. So, $\\pi(b) = \\pi(c)^{-1} = \\pi(c)$.\nThe recursive structure of the group implies that if $\\pi(b)=\\pi(c)$ and $\\pi(d)=1$, the image of the homomorphism must be trivial or $C_2$. It cannot be the whole of $D_8$.\nTherefore, there are no surjective homomorphisms from $\\Gamma$ to $D_8$. This case is also impossible.\n\n**Case 3: $\\Gamma/K \\cong V_4$**\nThis is the only remaining possibility. Let $H$ be a subgroup of index 4. Its core $K$ must satisfy $\\Gamma/K \\cong V_4$.\nThe index of $K$ in $\\Gamma$ is $[\\Gamma:K] = |\\Gamma/K| = |V_4| = 4$.\nWe know that $K = \\text{Core}(H) \\subseteq H$.\nThe indices are related by $[\\Gamma:K] = [\\Gamma:H][H:K]$.\nSubstituting the known values, we get $4 = 4 \\cdot [H:K]$.\nThis implies $[H:K] = 1$, which means $H=K$.\nTherefore, any subgroup of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group must be a normal subgroup with a quotient isomorphic to $V_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of such subgroups\nThe problem is now reduced to counting the number of normal subgroups $K$ in $\\Gamma$ such that $\\Gamma/K \\cong V_4$. This is equivalent to counting the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms from $\\Gamma$ to $V_4$.\nThe number of such subgroups is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{|\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma, V_4)|}{|\\text{Aut}(V_4)|} $$\nwhere $\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma, V_4)$ is the set of surjective homomorphisms from $\\Gamma$ to $V_4$.\n\n1.  **Calculate $|\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma, V_4)|$**: Since $V_4$ is abelian, any homomorphism $\\Gamma \\to V_4$ factors through $\\Gamma_{ab} \\cong (C_2)^3$. We need to count the number of surjective homomorphisms from $(C_2)^3$ to $V_4 \\cong (C_2)^2$. This is equivalent to counting surjective linear maps from a 3-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ to a 2-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n    *   The total number of homomorphisms (linear maps) is $(2^2)^{3} = 4^3 = 64$.\n    *   A map is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of $(C_2)^2$. The proper subgroups are the trivial group $\\{0\\}$ and the three subgroups of order 2 (lines through the origin).\n        *   The number of maps to the trivial subgroup is 1.\n        *   For each of the 3 subgroups of order 2, there are $(2^1)^3 = 8$ maps into it. One of these is the trivial map, so there are 7 non-trivial maps for each. Total maps whose image is a specific line: $3 \\times 7 = 21$.\n    *   The total number of non-surjective maps is $1 + 21 = 22$.\n    *   The number of surjective maps is $64 - 22 = 42$. So, $|\\text{Epi}(\\Gamma, V_4)| = 42$.\n\n2.  **Calculate $|\\text{Aut}(V_4)|$**: The automorphism group of $V_4 \\cong (C_2)^2$ is the general linear group $GL(2, \\mathbb{F}_2)$. The order of this group is $(2^2-1)(2^2-2) = 3 \\times 2 = 6$. So, $|\\text{Aut}(V_4)| = 6$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of subgroups**:\n    Number of subgroups = $\\frac{42}{6} = 7$.\n\nThus, there are 7 subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group. All of them are normal subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
