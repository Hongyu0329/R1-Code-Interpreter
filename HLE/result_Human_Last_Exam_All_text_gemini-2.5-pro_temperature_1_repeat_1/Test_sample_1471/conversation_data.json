    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the equation.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe problem asks to solve the equation `XXIV/XXX - XXXII/I = ?` and provide the answer in modern (Arabic) numbers. The equation involves fractions with Roman numerals and a subtraction operation.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Roman Numeral Conversion:** It is crucial to correctly convert each Roman numeral into its modern numerical equivalent.\n    *   `I` = 1\n    *   `V` = 5\n    *   `X` = 10\n    *   The rules of addition (e.g., `VI` = 6) and subtraction (e.g., `IV` = 4) must be applied correctly.\n2.  **Order of Operations:** The standard mathematical order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) must be followed. In this case, the divisions must be performed before the subtraction.\n3.  **Calculation Accuracy:** The arithmetic (division and subtraction) must be performed accurately.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.**\n\n*   **XXIV:**\n    *   `XX` represents 10 + 10 = 20.\n    *   `IV` represents 5 - 1 = 4.\n    *   Therefore, `XXIV` = 20 + 4 = **24**.\n*   **XXX:**\n    *   `XXX` represents 10 + 10 + 10 = **30**.\n*   **XXXII:**\n    *   `XXX` represents 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n    *   `II` represents 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Therefore, `XXXII` = 30 + 2 = **32**.\n*   **I:**\n    *   `I` represents **1**.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the modern numbers into the equation.**\n\nThe original equation `XXIV/XXX - XXXII/I` becomes:\n`24/30 - 32/1`\n\n**Step 3: Perform the calculations according to the order of operations.**\n\n*   **First, calculate the value of each fraction:**\n    *   `24 / 30` = 0.8\n    *   `32 / 1` = 32\n\n*   **Next, perform the subtraction:**\n    *   `0.8 - 32` = **-31.2**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe solution to the equation is -31.2.\n\n<<< -31.2 >>>"
