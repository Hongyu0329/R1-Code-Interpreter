    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of such functions. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the basic properties of f**\n\nLet $g(x) = \\exp(x)$. The equation is $f \\circ f = g$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. This means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is strictly increasing, it is injective, so we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case where f is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n\n1.  If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then for any $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ again (and reversing the inequality because $f$ is decreasing), we get $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means $f \\circ f$ is a strictly increasing function. The function $g(x) = \\exp(x)$ is indeed strictly increasing, so this is consistent.\n\n2.  Let's consider the range and limits of $f$. Since $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is an open interval $(I, S)$, where $S = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ and $I = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$.\n\n3.  Let's analyze the asymptotic behavior of $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) \\to I$. Let $y=f(x)$, so $y$ approaches $I$ from above. Then $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to I^+} f(y)$. We also know $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\exp(x) = \\infty$. So, $\\lim_{y \\to I^+} f(y) = \\infty$. Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, this can only happen if the argument approaches $-\\infty$. Thus, $I = -\\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to S$. Let $y=f(x)$, so $y$ approaches $S$ from below. Then $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to S^-} f(y)$. We also know $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$. So, $\\lim_{y \\to S^-} f(y) = 0$.\n    Since $f$ is decreasing, if $S = \\infty$, then $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} f(y) = I = -\\infty$. This contradicts the limit being 0. Therefore, $S$ must be a finite real number. As $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, its domain includes $S$, so we can say $\\lim_{y \\to S^-} f(y) = f(S)$. Thus, we must have $f(S)=0$.\n\n4.  So far, for a decreasing $f$, we have: Range($f$) = $(I, S) = (-\\infty, S)$ for some finite $S$, and $f(S)=0$.\n\n5.  Now consider the range of $f \\circ f$. Range($f \\circ f$) = $f(\\text{Range}(f)) = f((-\\infty, S))$.\n    Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, $f((-\\infty, S)) = (\\lim_{y \\to S^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y))$.\n    From our analysis above, $\\lim_{y \\to S^-} f(y) = f(S) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = S$.\n    So, Range($f \\circ f$) = $(0, S)$.\n\n6.  But we know Range($f \\circ f$) = Range($\\exp$) = $(0, \\infty)$.\n    Comparing the two results, we get $(0, S) = (0, \\infty)$, which implies $S=\\infty$.\n\n7.  This is a contradiction, as we concluded in point 3 that $S$ must be finite. Therefore, our initial assumption that $f$ can be strictly decreasing must be false.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case where f is strictly increasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\n1.  If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with $\\exp(x)$.\n\n2.  Let's analyze the range and limits of $f$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous, its range is $(L, S)$, where $L = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ and $S = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$.\n\n3.  Let's analyze the asymptotic behavior of $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, $\\exp(x) \\to \\infty$. This implies $S = \\infty$. (If $S$ were finite, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(f(x)) = f(S)$, which is finite. Contradiction).\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $\\exp(x) \\to 0$. $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to L} f(y)$. If $L$ were $-\\infty$, the limit would be $-\\infty$, not 0. Thus, $L$ must be a finite real number. By continuity of $f$, we have $f(L) = 0$.\n\n4.  So, for an increasing $f$, we have:\n    *   $f$ is a strictly increasing bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $(L, \\infty)$ for some finite $L$.\n    *   $f(L)=0$.\n    *   Since the range of $f$ is $(L, \\infty)$, we must have $f(x) > L$ for all $x$. In particular, $f(L) = 0 > L$. This implies $L$ must be negative.\n\n5.  Let's check for fixed points. If $f(x_0)=x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = x_0$, so $\\exp(x_0)=x_0$. This equation has no real solutions. Thus, $f$ has no fixed points. Since $f$ is continuous, either $f(x)>x$ for all $x$ or $f(x)<x$ for all $x$. As $\\exp(x) = f(f(x))$, if $f(x)<x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$, which contradicts $\\exp(x)>x$. Therefore, we must have $f(x)>x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 4: Construction and Cardinality of Increasing Solutions**\n\nWe can construct these functions. A function $f$ that satisfies the conditions is determined by its behavior on a \"starting\" piece of its domain. The relation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ allows us to extend this piece to the whole real line. A derived property, $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$, is also key.\n\nThe construction proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Choose a value for L.** Any negative real number $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ can be chosen. The set of choices for $L$ has cardinality $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n2.  **Define f on the interval $(-\\infty, L]$.** We need to define $f$ on this interval as a continuous, strictly increasing function $h$ such that $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} h(x) = L$ and $h(L)=0$. The range of this part of the function will be $(L, 0]$. So, we need to choose a homeomorphism $h: (-\\infty, L] \\to (L, 0]$.\n    The set of such homeomorphisms is non-empty. For any given $L$, we can show that there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ such distinct homeomorphisms. For example, by mapping $(-\\infty, L]$ and $(L, 0]$ to $[0,1]$ and counting the homeomorphisms between them.\n\n3.  **Extend f to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.**\n    *   For $x \\in (L, 0]$, we can define $f(x)$ by noting that for such $x$, there is a unique $t \\in (-\\infty, L]$ with $f(t)=h(t)=x$. Then $f(x)$ is defined as $f(f(t)) = \\exp(t) = \\exp(h^{-1}(x))$.\n    *   For $x > 0$, we can define $f(x)$ recursively using the property $f(x) = \\exp(f(\\ln x))$. For any $x>0$, we can find a unique integer $k \\ge 1$ such that $y = \\ln^{(k)}(x)$ falls into the domain $(-\\infty, 0]$ where $f$ is already defined. Then we define $f(x) = \\exp^{(k)}(f(y))$.\n\nThis construction, for each pair of choices $(L, h)$, generates a unique continuous function $f$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Cardinality Calculation**\n\nThe set of solutions $S$ is the set of all increasing functions found in Step 4. Each such function is uniquely determined by the pair $(L, h)$, where $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ and $h$ is a homeomorphism from $(-\\infty, L]$ to $(L, 0]$ with the given boundary conditions.\n\n*   The number of choices for $L$ is $|(-\\infty, 0)| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   For each choice of $L$, the number of choices for the function $h$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $L$ and $h$.\n$|S| = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum."
