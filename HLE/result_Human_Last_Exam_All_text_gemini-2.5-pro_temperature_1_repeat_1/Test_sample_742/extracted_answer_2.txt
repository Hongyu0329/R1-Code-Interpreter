No. The customary mathematical setting of quantum mechanics, which involves Hilbert spaces, operators, and the Schrödinger equation, is designed to model physical systems and their probabilistic behavior. Gödel's proof, on the other hand, is a formal argument within modal logic, dealing with abstract concepts of necessity, possibility, and "positive properties." The mathematical objects and rules of quantum mechanics have no inherent or customary connection to the metaphysical axioms and logical operators used in Gödel's proof. It is not possible to use this physical framework to prove a conclusion in a completely separate and abstract logical system.
