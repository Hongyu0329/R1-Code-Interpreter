    "Answering this question requires analyzing the 3-manifolds obtained by integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings and determining how many distinct elements they represent in the integral homology cobordism group $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n**1. Identify the relevant knots and surgeries.**\n*   The homology cobordism group $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ is the set of integral homology 3-spheres modulo the homology cobordism equivalence relation.\n*   An integral surgery on a knot $K$, denoted $S^3_p(K)$, results in an integral homology sphere if and only if the surgery coefficient $p$ is $\\pm 1$.\n*   We need to list all distinct knots with crossing number $c(K) \\le 4$. We must also consider their mirror images if they are chiral.\n    *   **0 crossings:** The unknot ($0_1$). It is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n    *   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot ($3_1$). It is chiral. Its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil, is denoted $-3_1$.\n    *   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). It is amphichiral.\n*   Therefore, the list of knots to consider is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $-3_1$, and $4_1$. For each of these, we must analyze the results of $+1$ and $-1$ surgery.\n\n**2. Use homology cobordism invariants to distinguish the resulting manifolds.**\nA powerful invariant for distinguishing elements in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ is the Heegaard Floer correction term, or $d$-invariant. It is a homomorphism $d: \\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3 \\to \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   $d(S^3) = 0$. Any manifold with $d(M) \\neq 0$ represents a non-trivial element.\n*   $d(-M) = -d(M)$, where $-M$ is the manifold $M$ with the opposite orientation.\n*   The manifold resulting from $p$-surgery on the mirror knot $-K$ is related to surgery on $K$ by $S^3_p(-K) = -S^3_{-p}(K)$. This implies $d(S^3_p(-K)) = -d(S^3_{-p}(K))$.\n\nAll knots under consideration are alternating, and alternating knots are a special type called L-space knots. For L-space knots with genus $g \\ge 1$, there are known formulas relating the $d$-invariant of the surgery to the Ozsváth-Szabó concordance invariant $\\tau(K)$. The correct formulas are:\n*   If $\\tau(K) \\le 0$:\n    *   $d(S^3_{+1}(K)) = -2\\tau(K)$\n    *   $d(S^3_{-1}(K)) = 2\\tau(K) - 2$\n*   If $\\tau(K) > 0$, we use the relations for the mirror knot $-K$ (for which $\\tau(-K) = -\\tau(K) < 0$):\n    *   $d(S^3_{+1}(K)) = -d(S^3_{-1}(-K)) = -(2\\tau(-K)-2) = 2\\tau(K)+2$\n    *   $d(S^3_{-1}(K)) = -d(S^3_{+1}(-K)) = -(-2\\tau(-K)) = -2\\tau(K)$\n\n**3. Analyze each knot.**\n\n*   **The Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   Surgery on the unknot $S^3_{\\pm 1}(0_1)$ yields the 3-sphere $S^3$.\n    *   This represents the identity element in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n    *   Contribution: **1 element** (the identity).\n\n*   **The Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**:\n    *   This is an L-space knot with $\\tau(3_1) = -1$.\n    *   $d(S^3_{+1}(3_1)) = -2(-1) = 2$. This gives a non-trivial element.\n    *   $d(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = 2(-1) - 2 = -4$. This gives another non-trivial element.\n    *   Contribution: **2 distinct non-trivial elements**.\n\n*   **The Left-Handed Trefoil ($-3_1$)**:\n    *   This is an L-space knot with $\\tau(-3_1) = 1$.\n    *   $d(S^3_{+1}(-3_1)) = 2(1) + 2 = 4$. This gives a non-trivial element.\n    *   $d(S^3_{-1}(-3_1)) = -2(1) = -2$. This gives another non-trivial element.\n    *   Contribution: **2 distinct non-trivial elements**.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   This is an amphichiral L-space knot with $\\tau(4_1) = 0$.\n    *   $d(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = -2(0) = 0$. A theorem by Lisca confirms that for an alternating knot $K$, $S^3_{+1}(K)$ is homology cobordant to $S^3$ if and only if $\\tau(K)=0$. Thus, this represents the identity element.\n    *   $d(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = 2(0) - 2 = -2$. This gives a non-trivial element.\n    *   Contribution: **1 new non-trivial element** (and the identity).\n\n**4. Consolidate the results and check for duplicates.**\n\nLet's list the distinct elements we have found, classified by their $d$-invariant:\n*   **d = 4**: One element, from $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$.\n*   **d = 2**: One element, from $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$.\n*   **d = 0**: The identity element, from surgeries on the unknot and from $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$.\n*   **d = -4**: One element, from $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$.\n*   **d = -2**: Here we have two candidates:\n    1.  From $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$ (this is the manifold $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$, the negative of the Poincaré sphere).\n    2.  From $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ (this is the Weber-Seifert dodecahedral space).\n\nThe $d$-invariant is not a complete invariant, so we must check if these two manifolds represent the same element. The manifold $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ is a Seifert fibered space and is a generator for the subgroup of $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ consisting of Seifert fibered homology spheres. The Weber-Seifert space is hyperbolic and is known not to be homology cobordant to any Seifert fibered space. More modern invariants (like the $\\kappa$ invariant from Khovanov homology) can distinguish them. Therefore, they represent two distinct elements in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n\n**Final Tally:**\n*   The identity element: 1\n*   Element with $d=4$: 1\n*   Element with $d=2$: 1\n*   Element with $d=-4$: 1\n*   Elements with $d=-2$: 2\n\nTotal number of distinct elements = $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6$."
