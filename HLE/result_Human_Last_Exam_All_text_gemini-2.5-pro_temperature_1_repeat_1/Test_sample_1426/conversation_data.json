    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Work and Section**\nThe work is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". The question concerns the very end of the symphony, which is the conclusion of the fourth and final movement, titled \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\". We need to examine the part written for the \"First Violin\" (Violino I) in the last few measures.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Analyze the Final Notes in the Score**\nThe phrase \"ends on three notes\" refers to the last three consecutive notes played by the first violin before the final silence. To find these, we must look at the score.\n\n*   The symphony ends in the key of B major.\n*   The very last measure of the piece has the first violins playing a single, sustained whole note.\n*   The measure immediately preceding the final one contains a rapid, descending arpeggio figure played by the first violins.\n\n**Step 3: List the Last Three Notes in Sequence**\nLooking at the score, we can identify the last three notes played by the first violin by reading backwards from the end.\n\n1.  **The final note:** In the last measure, the first violin plays a **B**. In scientific pitch notation, this is B5, the B located above the treble clef staff.\n2.  **The second-to-last note:** This is the last note of the arpeggio in the preceding measure. This note is a **B** one octave lower than the final note. In scientific pitch notation, this is B4, the B located on the middle line of the treble clef staff.\n3.  **The third-to-last note:** This is the note just before the B4 in the same arpeggio. This note is a **D-sharp**. In scientific pitch notation, this is D#5, the D-sharp on the fourth line of the treble clef staff.\n\nSo, the last three notes played, in order, are D#5, B4, and B5.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Pitches to Find the Lowest**\nNow we compare the three notes we have identified:\n*   B5 (a high B)\n*   D#5 (a D-sharp, which is lower than B5)\n*   B4 (a B that is an octave lower than B5, and also significantly lower than D#5)\n\n**Conclusion**\nComparing the three pitches, the B4 is the lowest note among the final three. The fundamental name of this note is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
