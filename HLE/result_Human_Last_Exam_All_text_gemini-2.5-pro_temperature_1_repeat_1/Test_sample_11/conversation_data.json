    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the very *first* piece of legislation passed by the modern State of Israel (i.e., post-1948) that explicitly contains the legal term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*). The question has specific formatting requirements for the final answer: do not include \"the\" or the statute's year.\n\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis and Common Misconception:** Many legal scholars and students would immediately point to the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is famous for establishing \"good faith\" as a foundational, overarching principle in Israeli law, particularly in its sections 12 (good faith in negotiation) and 39 (good faith in the performance of a contract). While this law was revolutionary in making good faith a \"super-principle,\" the question asks for the *first* statute to introduce the concept at all, not the one that gave it its broadest application. Therefore, we must look at legislation enacted before 1973.\n\n3.  **Investigating Pre-1973 Legislation:** We need to search for the term \"good faith\" in significant statutes enacted between 1948 and 1973.\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law uses the concept. For instance, it requires an agent to act in good faith towards the principal. This predates the 1973 Contracts Law.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law also explicitly refers to the obligation to act in good faith.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This major piece of legislation uses the concept of good faith in Section 9, which deals with competing transactions for the same property.\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This is a crucial candidate. It is a \"New Version\" of a law from the British Mandate period, but it was re-enacted as a statute of the State of Israel in 1957. Section 29 of this Ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" as someone who took a bill of exchange, among other things, \"in good faith\" (*בתום לב*).\n\n4.  **Comparing the Candidates and Identifying the First:**\n    *   Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]: **1957**\n    *   Agency Law: **1965**\n    *   Sale Law: **1968**\n    *   Land Law: **1969**\n    *   Contracts (General Part) Law: **1973**\n\n    By chronological order, the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957** is the earliest statute passed by the State of Israel on this list to explicitly use the term \"good faith.\"\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Explicitly Introduce\" vs. \"General Principle\":** It is critical to distinguish between the first *mention* of the concept and its establishment as a broad, general principle. The 1973 Contracts Law did the latter, but the 1957 Ordinance did the former.\n*   **\"Statute in the modern State of Israel\":** The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] from 1957 qualifies. Although it is based on a Mandatory ordinance, the \"New Version\" is a consolidation and re-enactment passed by the Knesset, making it an official statute of the State of Israel.\n*   **Formatting the Final Answer:** The instructions are very clear: omit the definite article (\"the\") and the year from the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the chronological analysis, the first statute to meet the criteria is the Bills of Exchange Ordinance from 1957. Adhering to the output format rules, the answer is the name of the statute without the year.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance>>>"
