    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Basic Objects and Setup\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff space. A metric continuum is a continuum that is also a metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a key example.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The composants of an indecomposable continuum partition it into disjoint, dense subsets.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification and Remainder:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$ (which includes all metric spaces), its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is the largest compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace. The Stone-Cech remainder is $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n*   **The Problem Setup:** We are given a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$. We consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ and its Stone-Cech remainder $Y^*$. The goal is to find the maximum possible number of composants of $Y^*$, where the maximum is taken over all possible choices of $X$ and $x$.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Remainder $Y^*$\n\n1.  The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, non-compact, separable metric space.\n2.  Consider the inclusion map $i: Y \\hookrightarrow X$. Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, the universal property of the Stone-Cech compactification guarantees a unique continuous extension map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$.\n3.  The image $\\pi(\\beta Y)$ is a compact (and thus closed) subset of $X$ that contains $Y$. Since $Y$ is dense in $X$, the image must be all of $X$. So, $\\pi$ is a surjective map.\n4.  By construction, $\\pi$ maps any point in $Y$ to itself. Therefore, the remainder $Y^*$ must be mapped entirely to the single point $\\{x\\}$. That is, $Y^* = \\pi^{-1}(x)$.\n5.  A standard theorem in topology (due to Frolik, related to Whyburn's work on irreducible maps) states that if $f: K_1 \\to K_2$ is a continuous map between compact Hausdorff spaces and for some point $y_0 \\in K_2$, the fiber $f^{-1}(y_0)$ is non-degenerate while all other fibers $f^{-1}(y)$ for $y \\neq y_0$ are singletons, then $f^{-1}(y_0)$ must be connected. In our case, $K_1 = \\beta Y$, $K_2 = X$, $f = \\pi$, and $y_0 = x$. Since $Y$ is not compact, the remainder $Y^*$ is non-empty (and hence non-degenerate). Thus, **the remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum**.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Possible Structures of the Remainder\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum possible* number of composants. This implies that the structure of the remainder $Y^*$ can vary depending on the choice of $X$ and $x$.\n\nA first line of reasoning might be as follows:\n*   The map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$ is monotone because all its fibers are connected.\n*   The codomain $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum.\n*   A well-known theorem by H. Cook states that if $f: M \\to I$ is a monotone map from a metric continuum $M$ onto a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $I$, then $M$ must also be hereditary indecomposable.\n*   If this theorem could be applied, it would imply that $\\beta Y$ is hereditary indecomposable. Since $Y^*$ is a subcontinuum of $\\beta Y$, $Y^*$ would have to be indecomposable. For a metric indecomposable continuum, the number of composants is always $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. For a non-metrizable one, it is at least $c$.\n\nHowever, there is a crucial subtlety:\n*   **The Contradiction and its Resolution:** The space $\\beta Y = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is **not metrizable** because $Y$ is not compact. Cook's theorem, in the form that is widely cited and used in standard texts on metric continua, assumes the domain is metrizable. The theorem does not necessarily hold for non-metrizable domains. This apparent contradiction is known in the literature. Therefore, we cannot conclude that $Y^*$ must be indecomposable based on this argument.\n\nThe correct approach relies on a deep result from continuum theory:\n*   **Minc's Theorem (1989):** For any continuum $K$, there exists a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ such that the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is homeomorphic to $K$.\n\nThis powerful theorem means we can choose our space $X$ such that the remainder $Y^*$ is homeomorphic to any continuum we desire.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Maximum Number of Composants\n\nGiven Minc's theorem, the problem is transformed into a new one: **What is the maximum number of composants that a continuum can have?**\n\n1.  To maximize the number of composants, we should choose an indecomposable continuum for $Y^*$. A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant (the space itself). An indecomposable continuum has at least $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n2.  The number of composants of any continuum $K$ is bounded by its cardinality, $|K|$.\n3.  We need to find a continuum $K$ that has the largest possible number of composants.\n4.  Consider the space $H = \\beta\\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$, the Stone-Cech remainder of the natural numbers. This is a compact, non-metrizable, totally disconnected space with cardinality $|H| = 2^c = 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$.\n5.  Let $K$ be the cone over $H$. That is, $K = (H \\times [0,1]) / (H \\times \\{0\\})$. This space $K$ is a well-known example of a non-metrizable indecomposable continuum.\n6.  The cardinality of $K$ is $|H| \\times |(0,1]| + 1 = 2^c \\cdot c + 1 = 2^c$.\n7.  It can be shown that for any two distinct points $p, q \\in H$, the corresponding points at the top of the cone, $(p,1)$ and $(q,1)$, lie in different composants. Since there are $|H| = 2^c$ such points, the continuum $K$ has at least $2^c$ composants.\n8.  Since the number of composants cannot exceed the cardinality of the space, the number of composants of $K$ is exactly $2^c$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBy Minc's theorem, we can choose a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ such that its remainder $Y^*$ is homeomorphic to the cone over $\\beta\\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$. This remainder is an indecomposable continuum with $2^c$ composants. The cardinality of any remainder of a separable space (like $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$) is at most $2^c$, so no remainder can have more than $2^c$ composants. Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is $2^c$.\n\nThe cardinality $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum. The final answer is $2^c$.\n\n>>>$2^c$"
