    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Role of Large Deviation Theorems**\n\nThe question asks to use the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems. In statistical mechanics, these theorems provide the rigorous mathematical foundation for the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**.\n\n*   **The Core Idea:** For a large system with many particles ($N \\to \\infty$), the overwhelming majority of possible microscopic configurations (microstates) correspond to a single macroscopic state (macrostate). This most probable macrostate is the equilibrium state. Any significant deviation from this state is exponentially unlikely.\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem quantifies the probability of observing an empirical distribution of states that deviates from the underlying distribution. In a physical context, it justifies that the probability of a macrostate is exponentially related to its entropy. The system seeks to maximize this entropy. The rate function in the theorem is directly related to the negative of the entropy.\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with large deviations of the *sum* of random variables (like total energy). It reinforces the idea that the system's average properties will be sharply concentrated around the values corresponding to the most probable macrostate.\n\nTherefore, using these theorems means we must find the macrostate that maximizes the system's entropy, subject to the physical constraints.\n\n**Step 2: Defining the System and its Entropy**\n\n*   **System:** A gas of light quanta (photons). Photons are bosons.\n*   **Key Property:** The number of photons is not conserved; they can be created and annihilated. This implies that the chemical potential, $\\mu$, is zero. This is a crucial point for this specific problem.\n*   **Macrostate:** A macrostate is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_j\\}$, where $n_j$ is the number of photons in the energy level $E_j$. We assume energy level $E_j$ has a degeneracy of $g_j$ (i.e., there are $g_j$ distinct quantum states with the same energy $E_j$).\n*   **Bose-Einstein Entropy:** For indistinguishable bosons, the number of ways to arrange $n_j$ particles into $g_j$ states is given by the combination with repetition formula $\\binom{n_j+g_j-1}{n_j}$. The total number of microstates for a given macrostate $\\{n_j\\}$ is the product over all energy levels:\n    $\\Omega(\\{n_j\\}) = \\prod_j \\binom{n_j+g_j-1}{n_j}$\n*   The entropy of this macrostate is given by Boltzmann's formula, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. Using Stirling's approximation ($\\ln x! \\approx x\\ln x - x$) for large $n_j$ and $g_j$, the entropy becomes:\n    $S(\\{n_j\\}) = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (n_j+g_j)\\ln(n_j+g_j) - n_j\\ln n_j - g_j\\ln g_j \\right]$\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Maximum Entropy Principle**\n\nWe find the equilibrium state by maximizing the entropy $S(\\{n_j\\})$ subject to the physical constraints.\n\n*   **Constraint:** The total energy of the system is fixed at a value $U$.\n    $U = \\sum_j n_j E_j$\n    (Note: There is no constraint on the total number of particles, $N = \\sum_j n_j$, because photons are not conserved).\n\n*   **Method of Lagrange Multipliers:** We maximize the function $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $n_j$:\n    $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left( \\sum_j n_j E_j - U \\right)$\n    where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint.\n\n*   **Maximization:** We set the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_j}$ to zero.\n    $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_j} \\left[ (n_j+g_j)\\ln(n_j+g_j) - n_j\\ln n_j \\right] - \\beta E_j = 0$\n    $\\left[ \\ln(n_j+g_j) + 1 \\right] - \\left[ \\ln n_j + 1 \\right] - \\beta E_j = 0$\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j+g_j}{n_j}\\right) = \\beta E_j$\n    $1 + \\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta E_j}$\n    $\\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta E_j} - 1$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Distribution:** This gives the famous Bose-Einstein distribution for the equilibrium occupation number $n_j^{eq}$:\n    $n_j^{eq} = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta E_j} - 1}$\n    The Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe \"mean energy\" is the total energy of the system at equilibrium. We obtain it by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers $n_j^{eq}$ into the energy constraint equation.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy ($U_{eq}$):**\n    $U_{eq} = \\sum_j n_j^{eq} E_j$\n    $U_{eq} = \\sum_j \\frac{g_j E_j}{e^{\\beta E_j} - 1}$\n    This is the general expression for the total energy of a photon gas at equilibrium temperature $T=1/(k_B\\beta)$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is the value of the entropy function $S$ when the occupation numbers are at their equilibrium values, $n_j^{eq}$. A convenient way to express this is using the grand canonical partition function $\\mathcal{Z}_{GC}$.\n\n*   **Grand Canonical Partition Function:** For bosons, the logarithm of the partition function is:\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}_{GC} = -\\sum_j g_j \\ln\\left(1 - e^{-\\beta(E_j-\\mu)}\\right)$\n*   **For Photons ($\\mu=0$):**\n    $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}_{GC} = -\\sum_j g_j \\ln\\left(1 - e^{-\\beta E_j}\\right)$\n*   **Thermodynamic Relation for Entropy:** The entropy $S$ is related to the energy $U$, temperature $T$, chemical potential $\\mu$, and the grand potential $\\Phi = -k_B T \\ln \\mathcal{Z}_{GC}$ by the relation $S = (U - \\mu N - \\Phi)/T$. For photons, $\\mu=0$.\n    $S = \\frac{U - \\Phi}{T} = \\frac{U}{T} + k_B \\ln \\mathcal{Z}_{GC}$\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy ($S_{eq}$):**\n    Substituting the expressions for $U_{eq}$ and $\\ln \\mathcal{Z}_{GC}$:\n    $S_{eq} = \\frac{U_{eq}}{T} + k_B \\left( -\\sum_j g_j \\ln\\left(1 - e^{-\\beta E_j}\\right) \\right)$\n    Using $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$, this can be written as:\n    $S_{eq} = k_B \\beta U_{eq} - k_B \\sum_j g_j \\ln\\left(1 - e^{-\\beta E_j}\\right)$\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **System Identification:** The crucial part of the \"Bose case of the light quanta\" is that photons are bosons for which the particle number is not conserved, meaning the chemical potential $\\mu=0$.\n2.  **Entropy Formula:** The correct entropy functional for indistinguishable bosons (Bose-Einstein statistics) must be used, not the simpler Shannon entropy which applies to distinguishable particles (Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics).\n3.  **Justification vs. Calculation:** The large deviation theorems (Boltzmann-Sanov, Cramér-Chernoff) provide the formal justification for using the principle of maximum entropy. The actual calculation is a standard procedure in statistical mechanics involving Lagrange multipliers.\n4.  **Generality of the Answer:** The question does not specify a physical container (e.g., a 3D box), so the results should be left in their general form as sums over the energy levels $E_j$ and degeneracies $g_j$. The specific energy spectrum would depend on the boundary conditions of the system.\n5.  **Meaning of \"Mean Energy\":** In this context, \"mean energy\" refers to the total energy of the system at equilibrium, which is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values are functions of the temperature $T$ (or its inverse $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$) and the energy spectrum $\\{E_j, g_j\\}$ of the system.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy ($U_{eq}$):**\nThe equilibrium mean energy is the sum of the energies of each level, weighted by their equilibrium occupation numbers:\n$U_{eq} = \\sum_j \\frac{g_j E_j}{e^{\\beta E_j} - 1}$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy ($S_{eq}$):**\nThe equilibrium entropy is given by the thermodynamic relation involving the grand canonical partition function evaluated at zero chemical potential:\n$S_{eq} = \\frac{U_{eq}}{T} - k_B \\sum_j g_j \\ln\\left(1 - e^{-\\beta E_j}\\right)$\n\nThese two expressions represent the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy for a gas of light quanta.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $U_{eq} = \\sum_j \\frac{g_j E_j}{e^{\\beta E_j} - 1}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S_{eq} = \\frac{U_{eq}}{T} - k_B \\sum_j g_j \\ln\\left(1 - e^{-\\beta E_j}\\right)$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, $E_j$ are the energy levels, and $g_j$ are their degeneracies.\n>>>"
