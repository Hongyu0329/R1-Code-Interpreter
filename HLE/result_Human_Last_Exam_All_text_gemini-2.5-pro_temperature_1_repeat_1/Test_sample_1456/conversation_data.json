    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core definitions.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a sphere, or a square.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point. The interval `[0, 1]` is a nondegenerate continuum, while a single point `{p}` is a degenerate continuum.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum. A proper subcontinuum of `X` is a subcontinuum that is not equal to `X`.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:** The number of composants of a continuum is directly related to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   A continuum `X` is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   A continuum `X` is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n*   **Number of Composants:** There is a fundamental theorem connecting these concepts:\n    *   A continuum has **exactly one** composant if and only if it is decomposable. In this case, the single composant is the entire space itself.\n    *   A continuum has **more than one** composant if and only if it is indecomposable. For an indecomposable metric continuum, it has uncountably many composants, specifically **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., the size of the set of real numbers). These composants form a partition of the space.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of the product space.\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. We are interested in their product `Z = X x Y`.\n*   The product of two compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's Theorem).\n*   The product of two connected spaces is connected.\n*   The product of two metric spaces is a metric space.\n*   Therefore, `Z = X x Y` is also a continuum.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible number of composants of `Z`. Based on Step 1, this means we need to determine the maximum possible number of composants `Z` can have, which boils down to whether `Z` can be made indecomposable.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate the decomposability of the product space `X x Y`.\n\nWe need to consider the properties of `X` and `Y`. They can be either decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n**Case 1: At least one of the continua, say `X`, is decomposable.**\n*   By definition of a decomposable continuum, `X = A U B`, where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`.\n*   Now consider the product space `Z = X x Y`. We can write it as:\n    `Z = (A U B) x Y = (A x Y) U (B x Y)`\n*   Let's analyze the sets `A x Y` and `B x Y`:\n    *   Since `A` is a continuum and `Y` is a continuum, their product `A x Y` is a continuum.\n    *   Since `A` is a *proper* subset of `X`, `A x Y` is a *proper* subset of `X x Y`. Therefore, `A x Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n    *   Similarly, `B x Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n*   We have successfully written `Z = X x Y` as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. This means `Z` is **decomposable**.\n*   A decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant.\n*   **Conclusion for Case 1:** If either `X` or `Y` (or both) are decomposable, their product `X x Y` is decomposable and has only 1 composant.\n\n**Case 2: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.**\n*   Since `X` and `Y` are required to be nondegenerate, we can indeed choose them to be indecomposable. A famous example of a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum is the **pseudo-arc**, or the **Knaster continuum** (bucket-handle).\n*   A major theorem in continuum theory, proved by R. H. Bing in 1951, states that **the Cartesian product of two indecomposable continua is indecomposable**.\n*   Therefore, if we choose `X` to be a pseudo-arc and `Y` to be a pseudo-arc, their product `Z = X x Y` is an **indecomposable** continuum.\n*   As established in Step 1, an indecomposable continuum has **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the final answer.\n\nWe have explored all possibilities for the continua `X` and `Y`.\n*   If at least one is decomposable, the product has 1 composant.\n*   If both are indecomposable, the product has `c` composants.\n\nThe question asks for the **largest possible number** of composants. Comparing the two outcomes, `c` is significantly larger than 1.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants is `c`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n1.  **Existence of Indecomposable Continua:** The argument relies on the existence of nondegenerate indecomposable continua. Such spaces exist and are a central topic in point-set topology.\n2.  **Product Properties:** It is crucial that the product of two continua is itself a continuum.\n3.  **Composant Number Theorem:** The direct link between decomposability and the number of composants (1 for decomposable, `c` for indecomposable) is the key to solving the problem.\n4.  **Bing's Theorem:** The result that the product of indecomposable continua is indecomposable is the cornerstone of the argument for the \"largest possible\" case.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest possible number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
