    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nWe need to find the connectivity of the map $\\sigma: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\nA map $f: X \\to Y$ is defined to be **$k$-connected** if the induced homomorphism on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the condition that the homotopy fiber of $f$ is $(k-1)$-connected.\n\n### Step 2: Use Adjunction to Reframe the Problem\nThe functors for reduced suspension ($\\Sigma$) and based loop space ($\\Omega$) are adjoint. This means there is a natural bijection of homotopy classes of maps:\n$[\\Sigma A, B] \\cong [A, \\Omega B]$.\nThe map in question, $\\sigma: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, has an adjoint map, which we will call $\\tilde{\\sigma}$:\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)) = \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nThe connectivity of $\\sigma$ can be determined by studying the induced maps on homotopy groups, $\\pi_k(\\sigma)$. The properties of $\\pi_k(\\sigma)$ are directly related to those of $\\pi_j(\\tilde{\\sigma})$.\nLet's analyze the induced map on homotopy groups:\n*   For $\\sigma$, the map is $\\pi_k(\\sigma): \\pi_k(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))$.\n*   Using the standard isomorphisms $\\pi_k(\\Sigma A) \\cong \\pi_{k-1}(A)$ and $\\pi_k(\\Omega B) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(B)$, this corresponds to a map:\n    $\\pi_{k-1}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\pi_{k+1}(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n*   For the adjoint map $\\tilde{\\sigma}$, the map is $\\pi_j(\\tilde{\\sigma}): \\pi_j(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\pi_j(\\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6))$.\n*   Using $\\pi_j(\\Omega^2 B) \\cong \\pi_{j+2}(B)$, this corresponds to a map:\n    $\\pi_j(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\pi_{j+2}(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nBy comparing the two, we see that the homomorphism induced by $\\sigma$ on $\\pi_k$ is the same as the homomorphism induced by $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ on $\\pi_j$ where $j=k-1$. Therefore, determining the connectivity of $\\sigma$ is equivalent to determining the connectivity of $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ and adjusting the index.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Connectivity of the Adjoint Map $\\tilde{\\sigma}$\nThe map $\\tilde{\\sigma}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is a well-studied map in the theory of iterated loop spaces. It is an instance of the general composition or product map:\n$\\alpha_{p,q}: \\Omega^p S^m \\wedge \\Omega^q S^n \\to \\Omega^{p+q}(S^m \\wedge S^n)$.\nIn our case, $m=4$, $n=6$, $p=1$, and $q=1$.\n\nA key result, for example from a paper by F. Cohen and L. Taylor (\"Computations of Gelfand-Fuks cohomology...\"), states that the connectivity of the map $\\alpha_{p,q}$ is given by the formula:\n**Connectivity = $m+n+p+q-3$**.\n\nLet's apply this formula to our map $\\tilde{\\sigma}$:\n*   $m=4$ (from $S^4$)\n*   $n=6$ (from $S^6$)\n*   $p=1$ (from $\\Omega^1$)\n*   $q=1$ (from $\\Omega^1$)\nConnectivity of $\\tilde{\\sigma} = 4 + 6 + 1 + 1 - 3 = 9$.\n\nSo, the map $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ is **9-connected**.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Connectivity of $\\tilde{\\sigma}$\nBy the definition of a $k$-connected map, if $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ is 9-connected, then the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_j(\\tilde{\\sigma})$, has the following properties:\n*   $\\pi_j(\\tilde{\\sigma})$ is an isomorphism for $j < 9$.\n*   $\\pi_j(\\tilde{\\sigma})$ is a surjection for $j = 9$.\n\n### Step 5: Translate the Result Back to the Original Map $\\sigma$\nWe now use the relationship $j=k-1$ to find the properties of $\\pi_k(\\sigma)$.\n*   $\\pi_k(\\sigma)$ is an isomorphism for $k-1 < 9$, which means for $k < 10$.\n*   $\\pi_k(\\sigma)$ is a surjection for $k-1 = 9$, which means for $k = 10$.\n\nThis is precisely the definition of a 10-connected map.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Notation and Definitions**: Correctly identifying the relationship between the maps $\\sigma$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ via the $(\\Sigma, \\Omega)$ adjunction is crucial. Understanding the definition of a $k$-connected map is equally important.\n2.  **Identifying the Map**: The map $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ must be identified as a standard map in homotopy theory whose connectivity is known. The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" suggests its origin within constructions like the Ganea fibration, which is where such maps naturally arise, but we can rely on the known connectivity result without reconstructing the entire diagram.\n3.  **Using the Connectivity Formula**: The formula for the connectivity of $\\alpha_{p,q}$ must be correctly recalled and applied.\n4.  **Final Translation**: The final step of translating the connectivity of $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ back to that of $\\sigma$ by shifting the index is a key part of the solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe map $\\sigma: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is 10-connected.\n\n<<<10>>>"
