    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific painting by a specific artist in a specific year and context.\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after Querner escaped from the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA, the Nazi paramilitary force active in early 1933).\n*   **Question:** What object does he hold in his hand as a symbol of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the painting titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe). The painting is well-documented and is housed in the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden, Germany.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the historical context.**\nCurt Querner was a German painter associated with the New Objectivity movement and was a member of the Communist Party. In March 1933, following the Nazi seizure of power, he was arrested by the SA and held in a makeshift concentration camp in Dresden. He escaped after a few weeks and went into hiding, during which time he painted this self-portrait.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the visual content of the painting.**\nThe portrait shows Querner with a tense, grim, and defiant expression, looking directly at the viewer. In his right hand, which is prominently featured in the foreground, he is holding a simple tobacco pipe.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the symbolism of the object.**\nGiven the context of his recent imprisonment and escape, the objects and expression in the painting are highly symbolic.\n*   The direct, confrontational gaze is an act of defiance, showing an unbroken spirit.\n*   The pipe is not a weapon or an overt political symbol. Instead, it represents a piece of everyday life and personal freedom. By painting himself holding it, Querner asserts his individuality and reclaims a sense of normalcy and self-possession that the totalitarian regime tried to strip from him. It is a symbol of quiet, steadfast, and personal resistance against dehumanization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the visual evidence from the painting with its historical context, we can conclude that the object held as a symbol of resistance is a pipe.\n\n<<<A pipe>>>"
