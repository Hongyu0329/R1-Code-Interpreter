The set $M$ should be defined as a subset of the space of continuous functions on the interval $[0,1]$, $C[0,1]$. Specifically, it should be the set of non-positive functions bounded by a constant $R$:
$M = \{u \in C[0,1] \mid -R \le u(x) \le 0 \text{ for all } x \in [0,1]\}$,
where the constant $R$ must satisfy the condition $R \ge 1/8$. A specific valid choice for the set is
$M = \{u \in C[0,1] \mid -1/8 \le u(x) \le 0 \text{ for all } x \in [0,1]\}$.
