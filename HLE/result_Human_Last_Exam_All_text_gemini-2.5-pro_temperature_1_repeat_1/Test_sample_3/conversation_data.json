    "Answering this question requires understanding the possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the object of study:** We are looking for the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$. This subgroup, denoted $E(K)[\\text{tors}]$, consists of all points on $E$ with coordinates in $K$ that have finite order. The Mordell-Weil theorem tells us that this is a finite abelian group.\n\n2.  **Structure of finite abelian groups:** Any finite abelian group can be written as a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order. A more convenient form for our purpose is the invariant factor decomposition, $E(K)[\\text{tors}] \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $m$ divides $n$. The order of this group is $mn$.\n\n3.  **Identify the condition \"non-cyclic\":** A group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ (with $m|n$) is cyclic if and only if $m=1$. Therefore, a non-cyclic group requires $m>1$.\n\n4.  **Identify the specific number field:** The base field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field. It is also the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6)$ where $\\zeta_6 = e^{i\\pi/3} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}$. This means that the 6th roots of unity, $\\mu_6$, are contained in $K$. This property is significant for the possible torsion structures.\n\n5.  **Use the classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields:** The possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified through the work of several mathematicians (Kenku, Momose, Kamienny, Najman, and others). We need to consult the specific list of possibilities for the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n6.  **List the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for $E(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}))$:** According to the established classification (for example, as summarized in F. Najman's 2015 survey \"Torsion of elliptic curves over number fields of small degree\"), the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   **Type 1:** $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9\\}$.\n    *   **Type 2:** $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n    *   **Type 3:** $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the order for each possible group and find the maximum:**\n    *   **For Type 1 ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$):** The order of this group is $2 \\times (2N) = 4N$. To find the largest order in this family, we take the largest possible value for $N$, which is $N=9$.\n        *   Largest order = $4 \\times 9 = 36$.\n        *   The corresponding group structure is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n    *   **For Type 2 ($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$):** The order of this group is $3 \\times (3N) = 9N$. The largest possible value for $N$ is $N=3$.\n        *   Largest order = $9 \\times 3 = 27$.\n        *   The corresponding group structure is $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n    *   **For Type 3 ($\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$):** The order of this group is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n8.  **Compare the maximum orders:** We compare the largest orders found in each family of possible non-cyclic groups:\n    *   Maximum from Type 1: 36\n    *   Maximum from Type 2: 27\n    *   Maximum from Type 3: 36\n\n    The largest value among these is 36.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 36. This order is realized by curves with torsion subgroups isomorphic to either $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
