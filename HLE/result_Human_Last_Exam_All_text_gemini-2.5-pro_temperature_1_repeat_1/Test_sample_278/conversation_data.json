    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the parametric curve**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nThe value of $b$ is defined piecewise:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b = 1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\sin t$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b = 5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first part of the curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$)**\nFor this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nThese are the standard parametric equations for a circle. Squaring and adding the equations gives $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nSince $t$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, the value of $y = \\sin t$ is always non-negative ($y \\ge 0$).\n*   At $t=0$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi/2$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\nThis part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second part of the curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$)**\nFor this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5 \\sin t$.\nThese are the parametric equations for an ellipse. We can write $\\cos t = x$ and $\\sin t = y/5$. Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which is $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$.\nSince $t$ ranges from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, the value of $y = 5 \\sin t$ is always non-positive ($y \\le 0$).\n*   As $t$ approaches $\\pi$ from the right, the point approaches $(\\cos \\pi, 5 \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=3\\pi/2$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5 \\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n*   As $t$ approaches $2\\pi$, the point approaches $(\\cos(2\\pi), 5 \\sin(2\\pi)) = (1, 0)$.\nThis part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5, centered at the origin.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the bounding box of the entire figure**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates. This defines the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that contains the figure.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:** For both parts of the curve, $x = \\cos t$. As $t$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$, the value of $\\cos t$ ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n    *   The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-coordinates:**\n    *   For the upper semi-circle ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$. The values range from 0 to 1. So, the maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5 \\sin t$. Since $\\sin t$ ranges from 0 to -1 in this interval, $y$ ranges from 0 to -5. So, the minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the dimensions of the smallest enclosing square**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that \"outcircles\" or encloses this figure must have a side length that is at least as large as the largest dimension of the figure.\nThe side length, $S$, of the smallest enclosing square must be equal to the maximum of the width and the height.\n$S = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the area of the smallest enclosing square**\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $A = S^2$.\n$A = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Pay close attention to the piecewise definition of the parameter $b$. It creates a composite shape, not a simple circle or ellipse.\n*   Correctly determine the range of the trigonometric functions over the specified intervals for $t$.\n*   The \"smallest square that outcircles the figure\" implies its sides must be parallel to the coordinate axes if the bounding box is defined by the min/max coordinates. The side length of this square will be the maximum of the figure's total width and total height.\n\n<<<36>>>"
