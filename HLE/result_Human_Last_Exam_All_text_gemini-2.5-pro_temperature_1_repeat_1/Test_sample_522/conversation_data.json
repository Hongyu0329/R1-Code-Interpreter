    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle to find the transformation rule.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Input and Output format\nThe input and output are strings representing a grid of digits. The commas (`,`) separate the rows of the grid. The grid contains three types of digits: '0', '1', and '2'. The core of the puzzle seems to be a transformation that changes the grid, primarily by moving the digit '2'.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Example A\n*   **Input_A:** `'001111,121111,111111'`\n*   **Output_A:** `'201111,101111,111111'`\n\nLet's represent this as a grid (using 0-based indexing for rows and columns):\n**Input Grid A:**\n```\n0 0 1 1 1 1  (Row 0)\n1 2 1 1 1 1  (Row 1)\n1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n```\n**Output Grid A:**\n```\n2 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n**Changes:**\n1.  The '2' at position `(r=1, c=1)` moves. Its original position becomes '0'.\n2.  A new '2' appears at `(r=0, c=0)`, which was previously a '0'.\n3.  The move can be described by a vector: `(new_r, new_c) = (old_r - 1, old_c - 1)`. This corresponds to a move North-West (NW).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Example B\n*   **Input_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'`\n*   **Output_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`\n\n**Input Grid B (relevant section):**\n```\n...\n...0000...  (Row 2)\n...0021...  (Row 3)\n...\n```\nThe '2' is at `(r=3, c=6)`.\n\n**Output Grid B (relevant section):**\n```\n...\n...0002...  (Row 2)\n...0001...  (Row 3)\n...\n```\n**Changes:**\n1.  The '2' at position `(r=3, c=6)` moves. Its original position becomes '0'.\n2.  A new '2' appears at `(r=2, c=7)`, which was previously a '0'.\n3.  The move can be described by a vector: `(new_r, new_c) = (old_r - 1, old_c + 1)`. This corresponds to a move North-East (NE).\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis\nWe have two different moves (NW and NE). The rule must depend on the local environment of the '2'. Let's examine the neighbors of '2' in each case. We consider the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).\n\n*   **Case A:** The '2' is at `(1,1)`.\n    *   Neighbor North `(0,1)` is '0'.\n    *   Neighbor South `(2,1)` is '1'.\n    *   Neighbor West `(1,0)` is '1'.\n    *   Neighbor East `(1,2)` is '1'.\n    *   There are **three** neighbors that are '1'. The move is NW.\n\n*   **Case B:** The '2' is at `(3,6)`.\n    *   Neighbor North `(2,6)` is '0'.\n    *   Neighbor South `(4,6)` is '1'.\n    *   Neighbor West `(3,5)` is '0'.\n    *   Neighbor East `(3,7)` is '1'.\n    *   There are **two** neighbors that are '1'. The move is NE.\n\nThis leads to a simple and consistent hypothesis:\n**The direction of the move depends on the number of adjacent '1's.**\n*   If there are **3** adjacent '1's, move **North-West** `(r-1, c-1)`.\n*   If there are **2** adjacent '1's, move **North-East** `(r-1, c+1)`.\nA precondition for the move is that the target cell must contain a '0'. Both examples satisfy this.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Hypothesis to Input_C\nThe puzzle asks for the value of `MISSING` for `Input_C`. The word 'MISSING' is a placeholder for the result we need to calculate.\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n\n**Input Grid C:**\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0  (Row 0)\n0 1 1 1 2 0  (Row 1)\n1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n```\n1.  **Locate '2':** The '2' is at position `(r=1, c=4)`.\n2.  **Examine neighbors:**\n    *   Neighbor North `(0,4)` is '0'.\n    *   Neighbor South `(2,4)` is '1'.\n    *   Neighbor West `(1,3)` is '1'.\n    *   Neighbor East `(1,5)` is '0'.\n3.  **Count adjacent '1's:** There are **two** neighbors that are '1'.\n4.  **Determine move:** According to our rule, when there are 2 adjacent '1's, the move is North-East `(r-1, c+1)`.\n    *   New position: `(1-1, 4+1) = (0,5)`.\n5.  **Validate move:** The target cell `(0,5)` must contain a '0'. Looking at Grid C, `grid[0][5]` is indeed '0'. The move is valid.\n\n### Step 6: Construct the Final Output\nWe apply the transformation to Grid C:\n1.  The value at the original position of '2', `(1,4)`, becomes '0'.\n2.  The value at the new position, `(0,5)`, becomes '2'.\n\n**Original Grid C:**\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 2 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n**Transformed Grid C:**\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nNow, we format this grid back into the output string format by joining the rows with commas.\n*   Row 0: `000002`\n*   Row 1: `011100`\n*   Row 2: `111111`\n\nThe final string is `000002,011100,111111`. This is the value of `MISSING`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
