    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **What:** Performing the role of Kitri\n    *   **When:** 2008\n    *   **Where:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Ballet & Act:** Don Quixote, Act I variation\n    *   **Specific Step:** single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\n\n2.  **Identify the Choreographic Section:** The question refers to Kitri's solo variation in Act I, which she performs with a fan. This is a famous piece of choreography separate from the grand pas de deux in Act III.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Step:** The question is highly technical. We need to look for a sequence of turns that meets all the following criteria:\n    *   **Pirouette:** A turn on one leg.\n    *   **Single-turn:** Exactly one rotation per pirouette.\n    *   **En dehors:** Turning outward, away from the supporting leg. This is the standard direction for this sequence.\n    *   **From the fifth position:** The preparation for each turn must begin in the fifth ballet position.\n\n4.  **Examine the Choreography:** The standard Bolshoi Ballet choreography for Kitri's Act I variation (the version by Alexei Fadeyechev after Petipa/Gorsky, which was in the repertoire in 2008) contains a distinct and well-known sequence of turns.\n    *   In this sequence, Kitri performs a series of pirouettes on the spot.\n    *   For each turn, she starts with a plié in the fifth position, executes a sharp single pirouette *en dehors*, and lands, punctuating the movement by snapping her fan open.\n    *   This entire action (prepare, turn, land, flourish with fan) is repeated multiple times in a row to fit a specific musical phrase.\n\n5.  **Count the Repetitions:** By observing recordings of Natalia Osipova performing this variation with the Bolshoi Ballet from that period, we can count the number of pirouettes in this specific sequence. The choreography is set to the music, which is structured in standard 8-count phrases. The sequence in question consists of exactly eight of these single pirouettes from the fifth position.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Variations:** It is crucial not to confuse the Act I variation with the Act III grand pas de deux coda, which is famous for its 32 fouetté turns. The question is explicitly about the Act I variation.\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** While individual dancers may have unique artistic interpretations, the fundamental steps and counts of a piece of choreography within a major company like the Bolshoi are highly standardized. The number of turns in this sequence is not typically altered.\n*   **Technical Specificity:** The question's precision (\"single-turn,\" \"en dehors,\" \"from fifth position\") is key. The answer must count only the turns that match this exact description, ignoring other turning steps in the variation like piqué turns on a diagonal. The identified sequence perfectly matches this description.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the standard Bolshoi Ballet choreography for Kitri's Act I variation, which Natalia Osipova would have performed in 2008, the specific sequence of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position contains 8 turns.\n\n<<<8>>>"
