    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Anton Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of times Otchumyelov's coat is described. The prompt correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic of his changing mentality, which means we should count not only adjectival descriptions but also the actions of him taking the coat off and putting it on, as these actions serve to describe his psychological state.\n\n**Step 2: List the careful points for analysis.**\n*   The analysis must identify every distinct mention or action related to the coat.\n*   The term \"description\" must be interpreted in its literary sense, where an action (like taking off a coat) describes a character's state of mind.\n*   We will go through the story chronologically to find each instance.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-step analysis of the text.**\n\nWe will count each time Chekhov draws the reader's attention to the coat to symbolize a change in Otchumyelov's attitude.\n\n1.  **First Description:** The story begins by introducing the police superintendent. Chekhov writes that Otchumyelov walks across the market square \"in a new overcoat.\" This initial description establishes the coat as a part of his official uniform and status.\n2.  **Second Description:** Otchumyelov, believing the dog is a worthless stray, acts with blustering authority. He feels hot and commands the policeman, \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin... it's scorching!\" This act of removing the coat symbolizes his confidence and comfort in his power over the situation.\n3.  **Third Description:** A voice in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov is immediately struck with fear. He says, \"Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad... there's a wind getting up... I am shivering.\" Putting the coat on symbolizes his sudden fear, subservience, and need for protection.\n4.  **Fourth Description:** The policeman remarks that the General does not own such dogs. Otchumyelov's confidence returns instantly. He flips back to his authoritative stance and says, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin.\" This is the second time he removes the coat, again symbolizing a shift to a dominant and self-assured mood.\n5.  **Fifth Description:** The General's cook, Prokhor, walks by, and Otchumyelov immediately assumes the dog must be connected to the General's household. His fear returns, and he feels a chill. He tells the policeman, \"put my coat on.\" This is the second time he puts the coat on, signaling his return to a state of anxiety and servility.\n6.  **Sixth Description:** After the dog is identified as belonging to the General's brother, the situation is resolved without Otchumyelov having to offend anyone important. As he leaves the scene, Chekhov provides a final image: \"...wrapping himself in his greatcoat, he goes on his way...\" This final action describes him retreating back into the protective shell of his official authority, closing the incident.\n\n**Step 4: Final Tally.**\nBy counting each of these distinct instances where the coat is mentioned or used as a device to describe Otchumyelov's state, we arrive at a total of six descriptions.\n\n<<<6>>>"
