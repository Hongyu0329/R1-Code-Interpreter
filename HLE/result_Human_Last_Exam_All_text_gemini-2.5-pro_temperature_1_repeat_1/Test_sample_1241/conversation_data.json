    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe given system of equations describes the dynamics of a continuous-time Markov chain with four states (0, 1, 2, 3). The functions $P_i(t)$ represent the probability of being in state $i$ at time $t$. The constants $\\lambda_{ij}$ are the transition rates from state $i$ to state $j$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This corresponds to the sum of the steady-state (or stationary) probabilities for states 0 and 1. The steady-state probabilities, which we denote as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are the probabilities when the system reaches equilibrium.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Steady-State Equations\nAt equilibrium, the probabilities no longer change over time. This means that the derivatives of the probabilities with respect to time are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\nLet $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1:\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n### Step 3: Substitute the Given Values\nWe are given the following transition rates:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equations from Step 2:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_{0} + 0.65 p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 p_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) p_{1} + 0.392 p_{2} + 0.008 p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_{2} - 0.008 p_{3}$\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\nLet's simplify equations 2 and 3:\n2.  $0 = 0.019 p_{0} - 1.05 p_{1} + 0.392 p_{2} + 0.008 p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_{1} - 0.4 p_{2}$\n\n### Step 4: Solve the System of Linear Equations\nA common strategy is to express probabilities $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 p_{0} = 0.65 p_{1} \\implies p_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_{1}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 p_{1} = 0.4 p_{2} \\implies p_{2} = p_{1}$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 p_{2} = 0.008 p_{3} \\implies p_{3} = p_{2}$. Since $p_2 = p_1$, we have $p_{3} = p_{1}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is good practice to check that these relationships are consistent with the remaining equation (equation 2). Substituting $p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}p_1$, $p_2 = p_1$, and $p_3 = p_1$ into equation 2:\n$0 = 0.019 \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_{1}\\right) - 1.05 p_{1} + 0.392 (p_{1}) + 0.008 (p_{1})$\n$0 = 0.65 p_1 - 1.05 p_1 + 0.392 p_1 + 0.008 p_1$\n$0 = (0.65 - 1.05 + 0.4) p_1$\n$0 = 0$\nThe equations are consistent, which confirms our relationships are correct.\n\nNow, use the normalization condition (equation 5) to find the value of $p_1$:\n$p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_{1}\\right) + p_{1} + p_{1} + p_{1} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) p_{1} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) p_{1} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) p_{1} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) p_{1} = 1$\n$p_{1} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Required Sum\nThe question asks for $p_0 + p_1$. We have expressions for both in terms of $p_1$:\n$p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$\n\nSo, the sum is:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right) p_1 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right) p_1$\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019}\\right) p_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.669}{0.019}\\right) p_1$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $p_1$ we found:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.669}{0.019}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right)$\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, perform the division:\n$p_0 + p_1 = 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of significant figures (e.g., five), we get 0.94625.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$ is the sum of the steady-state probabilities $p_0$ and $p_1$. Following the steps above, this value is calculated as $\\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
