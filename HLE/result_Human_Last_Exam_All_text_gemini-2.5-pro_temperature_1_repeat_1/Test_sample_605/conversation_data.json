    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Step-by-Step Question Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a specific algebraic variety.\n2.  **Identify the Object:** The object is a \"Calabi-Yau Link\" defined by the polynomial equation `0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3`.\n3.  **Identify the Ambient Space:** The variety exists in a weighted complex space where the coordinates `(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)` have associated weights `(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n4.  **Recall Definitions:**\n    *   **Quasi-homogeneous Polynomial:** A polynomial where every monomial has the same weighted degree. The weighted degree of a monomial `z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}...z_n^{a_n}` is `a_1w_1 + a_2w_2 + ... + a_nw_n`. This common degree is denoted by `d`.\n    *   **Crawley-Nordström Invariant:** For a quasi-homogeneous polynomial `W` with degree `d` and weights `w_i`, the invariant is defined as `inv(W) = d - Σ(w_i)`.\n    *   **Calabi-Yau Condition:** For a hypersurface defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial `W=0` in a weighted projective space, the Calabi-Yau condition is that the degree of the polynomial is equal to the sum of the weights, i.e., `d = Σ(w_i)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Homogeneity Check:** The defining polynomial must be quasi-homogeneous for the degree `d` to be well-defined. It is crucial to check if all monomials yield the same weighted degree.\n2.  **Typo Detection:** If the polynomial is not quasi-homogeneous, there might be a typo in the problem statement. The context (e.g., being called a \"Calabi-Yau Link\") can help resolve ambiguities.\n3.  **The \"Calabi-Yau\" Clue:** The problem explicitly states the object is a \"Calabi-Yau Link\". This is a very strong hint, as it implies that the Calabi-Yau condition `d = Σ(w_i)` must hold. This can be used to determine the correct degree `d` even if the polynomial has a typo.\n4.  **Arithmetic Precision:** All calculations, especially the sum of weights and the weighted degree of each monomial, must be performed carefully.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the sum of the weights (Σw_i).**\n\nThe given weights are `w_1=22`, `w_2=29`, `w_3=49`, `w_4=50`, `w_5=75`.\nΣw_i = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 + w_5\nΣw_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75\nΣw_i = 51 + 49 + 50 + 75\nΣw_i = 100 + 50 + 75\nΣw_i = 150 + 75\n**Σw_i = 225**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree `d` of the quasi-homogeneous polynomial `W`.**\n\nLet's calculate the weighted degree for each monomial in the polynomial `W = z_1^8z_3 + z_1^4z_2^3z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3`.\n\n*   `deg(z_1^8 z_3)` = 8 * w_1 + 1 * w_3 = 8 * 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = **225**\n*   `deg(z_1^4 z_2^3 z_3)` = 4 * w_1 + 3 * w_2 + 1 * w_3 = 4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 175 + 49 = **224**\n*   `deg(z_1 z_2^7)` = 1 * w_1 + 7 * w_2 = 1 * 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = **225**\n*   `deg(z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4 z_5)` = w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = **225**\n*   `deg(z_2 z_3^4)` = 1 * w_2 + 4 * w_3 = 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = **225**\n*   `deg(z_4^3 z_5)` = 3 * w_4 + 1 * w_5 = 3 * 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = **225**\n*   `deg(z_5^3)` = 3 * w_5 = 3 * 75 = **225**\n\nWe observe that all monomials have a weighted degree of 225, except for `z_1^4z_2^3z_3`, which has a degree of 224. This indicates a typo in the polynomial expression. However, since the object is explicitly identified as a \"Calabi-Yau Link\", its defining polynomial must be quasi-homogeneous and satisfy the Calabi-Yau condition. The overwhelming evidence from the other six monomials points to the correct degree being `d = 225`.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition.**\n\nThe Calabi-Yau condition is `d = Σ(w_i)`.\nFrom Step 1, we found `Σ(w_i) = 225`.\nFrom Step 2, we deduced `d = 225`.\nSince `225 = 225`, the Calabi-Yau condition is satisfied, confirming our deduction about the degree `d`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström Invariant.**\n\nThe formula for the invariant is `inv(W) = d - Σ(w_i)`.\nSubstituting the values we found:\ninv(W) = 225 - 225\n**inv(W) = 0**\n\nThe result is 0, which is the expected value for any variety that satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition by definition.\n\n<<<0>>>"
