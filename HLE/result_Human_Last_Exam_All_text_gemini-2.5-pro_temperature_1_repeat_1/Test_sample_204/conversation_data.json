    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe vector field is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where:\n$n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nwith the functions $f, r_2, G$ defined as:\n$f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$\n$r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2}$\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$\n\nThis vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector for all $(x,y,z)$, so it represents a map from a domain in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the unit sphere $S^2$. The coordinates on the sphere can be written as $(\\Theta, \\Phi)$, where $\\mathbf{n} = (\\sin\\Theta\\cos\\Phi, \\sin\\Theta\\sin\\Phi, \\cos\\Theta)$. By comparison, we have:\n$\\Theta = G(x,y,z)$\n$\\Phi = f(x,y)$\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) $Q_H$ is a topological invariant that characterizes such maps. Fundamentally, it is defined as the **linking number** of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere $S^2$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Map at Key Locations\n\nTo understand the topological structure, we examine where specific points on the sphere are mapped from.\n\n*   **North Pole**: The North Pole corresponds to $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,1)$, which means $\\cos(G)=1$. This requires $G=2k\\pi$ for an integer $k$. Given $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$, and since $r_2 \\ge 0$, we have $0 < G \\le \\pi$. The only possibility is $G \\to 0$, which happens when $r_2 \\to \\infty$. So, the preimage of the North Pole is the point at infinity. This means the field is constant at the boundary of space, which is a necessary condition for a well-defined topological charge.\n\n*   **South Pole**: The South Pole corresponds to $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,-1)$, which means $\\cos(G)=-1$. This requires $G=(2k+1)\\pi$. Within the range of $G$, this means $G=\\pi$.\n    $G=\\pi \\implies \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1 \\implies r_2=0$.\n    From the definition of $r_2$, $r_2=0$ implies $(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2=0$. This can only be true if both terms are zero:\n    $z=0$\n    $x^2+y^2-0.5 = 0 \\implies x^2+y^2 = 0.5$\n    This is the equation of a circle in the $xy$-plane with radius $1/\\sqrt{2}$, centered at the origin. Let's call this circle $C_S$.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Linking Number Definition\n\nThe Hopf charge $Q_H$ is the linking number of the preimages of two points. Let's choose the South Pole, whose preimage is the circle $C_S$, and a point on the equator, say $\\mathbf{p}_E = (1,0,0)$.\n\n*   **Preimage of the Equatorial Point (1,0,0)**:\n    This requires $n_z=\\cos(G)=0$, $n_x=\\sin(G)\\cos(f)=1$, and $n_y=\\sin(G)\\sin(f)=0$.\n    1.  $\\cos(G)=0 \\implies G=\\pi/2$.\n        $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 \\implies -10 r_2 = -\\ln(2) \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n        Let $R = \\ln(2)/10$. The condition becomes $(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2 = R^2$. This is the equation of a torus (specifically, a spindle torus).\n    2.  $\\cos(f)=1$ and $\\sin(f)=0$. This implies $f=0$. From $f=\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$, this means $y=0$ and $x>0$.\n\n    Combining these conditions, the preimage of $(1,0,0)$ is a curve $C_E$ in the $xz$-plane (since $y=0$) defined by:\n    $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = R^2$, with $x>0$.\n    This is a closed loop in the right-half of the $xz$-plane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Linking Number of $C_S$ and $C_E$\n\nWe need to find $Lk(C_S, C_E)$. A practical way to do this is to consider the disk $D_S$ bounded by the circle $C_S$ (i.e., the disk $x^2+y^2 \\le 0.5$ in the $z=0$ plane) and count how many times the loop $C_E$ pierces this disk, taking orientation into account.\n\n1.  **Find intersection points**: The loop $C_E$ lies in the $xz$-plane. It intersects the plane of the disk ($z=0$) when:\n    $(x^2-0.5)^2 = R^2 \\implies x^2-0.5 = \\pm R \\implies x^2 = 0.5 \\pm R$.\n    Since $x>0$, we have two intersection points at $y=0, z=0$:\n    $x_1 = \\sqrt{0.5 - R}$\n    $x_2 = \\sqrt{0.5 + R}$\n    The radius of the disk $D_S$ is $\\sqrt{0.5}$.\n    Since $R = \\ln(2)/10 \\approx 0.0693 > 0$, we have $x_1 < \\sqrt{0.5}$ and $x_2 > \\sqrt{0.5}$.\n    This means the loop $C_E$ pierces the $z=0$ plane once inside the disk $D_S$ (at $x_1$) and once outside it (at $x_2$). Therefore, the magnitude of the linking number is 1.\n\n2.  **Determine the sign**: The sign of the linking number depends on the orientations of the curves.\n    *   Let's orient the disk $D_S$ with its normal pointing in the $+z$ direction. By the right-hand rule, this means the boundary circle $C_S$ is oriented counter-clockwise.\n    *   Let's determine the direction of $C_E$ at the intersection point $x_1$. The curve $C_E$ is given by $z = \\pm \\sqrt{R^2 - (x^2-0.5)^2}$. The intersection point $x_1$ corresponds to $x^2-0.5 = -R$.\n    *   We can parameterize $C_E$ by an angle $\\theta$: let $x^2-0.5 = R\\cos\\theta$ and $z=R\\sin\\theta$. The point $x_1$ corresponds to $\\theta=\\pi$.\n    *   The tangent vector's z-component is $dz/d\\theta = R\\cos\\theta$. At $\\theta=\\pi$, $dz/d\\theta = -R < 0$.\n    *   This means that as the curve $C_E$ is traced in the direction of increasing $\\theta$, it passes through the disk $D_S$ moving in the negative $z$ direction.\n    *   Since the curve's direction is opposite to the disk's normal vector, the signed intersection number is -1.\n\nThus, the linking number is $Lk(C_S, C_E) = -1$.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Singularity**: The given vector field is singular on the z-axis ($x=y=0$) because $f=\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$ is not defined there, and $\\sin(G)$ is not zero on the axis (except at $z=\\pm\\infty$). Strictly speaking, the map is from $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{\\text{z-axis}\\}$ to $S^2$, which cannot support a non-zero Hopf charge. However, in physical and mathematical contexts, such singular formulas often represent idealized models of topological structures. The standard interpretation is to consider the charge of a regularized version of the field, which would be an integer. The linking number calculation is robust against small regularizations of the field.\n*   **Whitehead Integral**: The Whitehead integral formula for the Hopf charge, $Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int \\mathbf{A} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) \\, dV$, is difficult to apply directly because the standard choices for the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$ are also singular on the z-axis, leading to an integrand that is deceptively zero everywhere except on the singularity. A correct calculation would involve handling the singular line with boundary terms, which is complex.\n*   **Conclusion**: The geometric method of calculating the linking number of preimages is the most direct and physically meaningful approach. This calculation unambiguously yields a linking number of -1.\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge of the given field is -1.\n\n<<< -1 >>>"
