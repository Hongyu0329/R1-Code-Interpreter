    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the surname of an English poet. This surname appears within a specific context: a Russian translation of an essay that describes the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Clues:**\n    *   **Location:** Wide boulevards of Vienna (e.g., the Ringstrasse).\n    *   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay. This implies the solution likely involves the Russian language itself.\n    *   **Subject:** The surname of an English poet.\n    *   **Nature of the Problem:** The phrasing suggests this is a riddle or a question based on a well-known piece of trivia, rather than a straightforward literary search. The solution is unlikely to be found by simply searching for essays about Vienna.\n\n3.  **Focus on the \"Russian Translation\" Aspect:** The most critical part of the puzzle is that the name appears in a *Russian text*. This points towards a pun or wordplay based on how an English name is pronounced or written in Russian (Cyrillic script).\n\n4.  **Consider the Pun:** Let's think about famous English poets and their Russian transliterations.\n    *   Shakespeare -> Шекспир (Shekspir)\n    *   Byron -> Байрон (Bayron)\n    *   Shelley -> Шелли (Shelli)\n    *   Keats -> Китс (Kits)\n\n5.  **Connect the Pun to the Context:** The context is \"wide boulevards\" and travel across them, likely by horse-drawn carriage in the era these boulevards were built. The pun must relate to this.\n\n6.  **Unraveling the Riddle:**\n    *   The surname in question is **Keats**.\n    *   In Russian, this name is transliterated as **Китс** (pronounced \"Kits\").\n    *   This sounds identical to a combination of two sounds a Russian coachman (izvozchik) might make:\n        *   **\"Ки!\"** (or \"Ги!\"): A cry to urge the horse to start moving (\"Giddy-up!\").\n        *   **\"тс!\"** (or \"тпру!\"): A sound to command the horse to stop (\"Whoa!\").\n    *   The riddle or anecdote goes that the boulevards of Vienna are so wide that a coachman wouldn't even manage to get his horse across between the command to *start* (\"Ки!\") and the command to *stop* (\"тс!\").\n    *   Therefore, the full phrase \"Ки-тс\" (Keats) is used to humorously describe the immense width of the boulevards.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **It's a Pun, Not a Literal Mention:** The poet John Keats is not actually being discussed in the essay. His name is used purely for its phonetic value in a Russian-language joke.\n*   **The Specific Essay is a Red Herring:** While the anecdote might appear in a specific text (it is sometimes attributed to Russian writers like Pyotr Vail), knowing the exact essay is not necessary to solve the riddle. The riddle itself is the key.\n*   **Language is Crucial:** The puzzle is unsolvable without understanding the potential for wordplay between English and Russian.\n*   **The Poet Must be English:** The question specifies an *English* poet, which correctly points to John Keats, ruling out poets of other nationalities like the German Heinrich Heine, who is the subject of a similar, but different, anecdote.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis leads directly to the surname of the English poet John Keats, as its Russian transliteration \"Китс\" forms the basis of a pun describing the width of Viennese boulevards.\n\n<<<Keats>>>"
