    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the upper bound.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Interpret the Terminology\n\nFirst, we need to understand the components of the question.\n\n*   **\"Squarefree natural numbers (N)\"**: A natural number is squarefree if none of its prime factors are repeated. This term typically arises in algebraic number theory to define quadratic number fields. Since N is a natural number (positive), we are dealing with real quadratic fields, denoted as $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n\n*   **\"Lattice\" and \"Covolume (V)\"**: The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the number field $K$, or more generally any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ within $\\mathcal{O}_K$, can be represented as a lattice when embedded into a real vector space. For a real quadratic field, the canonical embedding maps an element $\\alpha \\in K$ to a vector $(\\sigma_1(\\alpha), \\sigma_2(\\alpha)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, where $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are the two distinct embeddings of $K$ into $\\mathbb{R}$ (e.g., $\\sigma_1(a+b\\sqrt{N}) = a+b\\sqrt{N}$ and $\\sigma_2(a+b\\sqrt{N}) = a-b\\sqrt{N}$). This creates a lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The **covolume (V)** of this lattice is the volume of its fundamental domain. For a lattice derived from an ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$, the covolume is $V = N(\\mathfrak{a})\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$, where $N(\\mathfrak{a})$ is the norm of the ideal and $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field $K$.\n\n*   **\"Maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\"**: This refers to the $L_\\infty$-norm (or max norm) of vectors in the lattice. For a vector $x = (x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the maximum norm is $||x||_\\infty = \\max(|x_1|, |x_2|)$. The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is best interpreted as the length of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice, where \"length\" is measured using the maximum norm. This quantity is more formally known as the first successive minimum of the lattice with respect to the $L_\\infty$ norm, denoted $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda)$. So, we interpret $k_{k,\\infty}$ as $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda) = \\min \\{ ||x||_\\infty : x \\in \\Lambda, x \\neq 0 \\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Frame the Problem in Geometry of Numbers\n\nThe question asks for an upper bound on $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda)$ in terms of the covolume $V$. This is a classic problem in the field of Geometry of Numbers, and the fundamental tool to solve it is Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem.\n\n**Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem**: Let $\\Lambda$ be a full-rank lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with covolume $V$. Let $S$ be a convex, centrally symmetric, and compact body in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. If the volume of $S$, denoted $\\text{vol}(S)$, satisfies the condition $\\text{vol}(S) \\ge 2^n V$, then $S$ must contain at least one non-zero lattice point from $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Minkowski's Theorem to the Specific Case\n\nWe can apply this theorem to find the desired upper bound.\n\n1.  **Lattice Setup**: Our lattice $\\Lambda$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, so the dimension is $n=2$. Its covolume is $V$.\n\n2.  **Choice of Convex Body**: We are interested in the maximum norm ($L_\\infty$). The \"ball\" for the $L_\\infty$ norm is a hypercube. In our 2-dimensional case, it is a square. Let's define our convex set $S$ as a square centered at the origin with side length $2c$:\n    $S_c = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : ||x||_\\infty \\le c \\}$\n\n3.  **Volume of the Convex Body**: The volume (area) of this square is:\n    $\\text{vol}(S_c) = (2c)^2 = 4c^2$\n\n4.  **Applying Minkowski's Condition**: According to the theorem, if we want to guarantee that $S_c$ contains a non-zero lattice point, we need its volume to be at least $2^n V$. With $n=2$, the condition is:\n    $\\text{vol}(S_c) \\ge 2^2 V$\n    $4c^2 \\ge 4V$\n    $c^2 \\ge V$\n    $c \\ge \\sqrt{V}$\n\n### Step 4: Draw the Conclusion\n\nMinkowski's theorem tells us that by choosing $c = \\sqrt{V}$, the set $S_{\\sqrt{V}}$ is guaranteed to contain at least one non-zero lattice vector $x \\in \\Lambda$.\n\nBy the definition of the set $S_{\\sqrt{V}}$, any vector $x$ within it satisfies $||x||_\\infty \\le \\sqrt{V}$.\n\nSince there exists at least one non-zero vector $x \\in \\Lambda$ with this property, the maximum norm of the shortest non-zero vector, $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda)$, cannot be larger than this value. Therefore, we have the upper bound:\n$\\lambda_{1,\\infty}(\\Lambda) \\le \\sqrt{V}$\n\nThis means the upper bound for the maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$) in relation to the covolume ($V$) is $\\sqrt{V}$."
