    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty Hausdorff space. The prompt specifies \"(not necessarily metric)\", so we must use this more general topological definition, not restrict ourselves to metric spaces.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ that cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. That is, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua (compact, connected subsets), then either $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $X$, its composant, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $x \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $x$. The composants of a continuum form a partition of the space; that is, they are pairwise disjoint and their union is the entire space.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing a Lower Bound\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest* number of composants.\n\n*   **Can the number be 1?**\n    If a continuum $X$ has only one composant, then this single composant must be the entire space $X$. By definition, this means that for any two points $p, x \\in X$, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both $p$ and $x$. A continuum with this property is called a *decomposable* continuum.\n    Conversely, an indecomposable continuum cannot have this property. Therefore, an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n*   **Conclusion:** The number of composants must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Metric Case\n\nIt is instructive to first consider the more familiar case of metric continua.\n\n*   For an indecomposable *metric* continuum, it is a well-known theorem that every proper subcontinuum is nowhere dense (its closure has an empty interior).\n*   Furthermore, in a metric continuum (which is separable), any composant can be expressed as a countable union of proper subcontinua.\n*   Therefore, in an indecomposable metric continuum, every composant is a countable union of nowhere-dense sets. Such a set is called a *meager set* (or a set of the first category).\n*   The **Baire Category Theorem** states that a complete metric space (which includes any compact metric space like a continuum) is non-meager (or of the second category). This means it cannot be written as a countable union of meager sets.\n*   Since the continuum is the disjoint union of its composants, if there were only a countable number of them (e.g., 2, 3, ..., or even countably infinite), the entire space would be a countable union of meager sets, which would make the space itself meager.\n*   This would contradict the Baire Category Theorem.\n*   Therefore, any indecomposable *metric* continuum must have an **uncountable** number of composants. In fact, a stronger result shows that the number of composants is always $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the General (Non-Metric) Case\n\nThe crucial part of the question is the phrase \"(not necessarily metric)\". This allows for continua that are not metric spaces.\n\n*   The argument from Step 3 that forces an uncountable number of composants relies on the Baire Category Theorem, which in turn relies on the composants being meager sets.\n*   The proof that composants are meager depends on the continuum being separable (or second-countable), which is true for all metric continua but not for all compact Hausdorff continua.\n*   For a non-metric (and non-separable) continuum, a composant might be an uncountable union of nowhere-dense sets. Such a union is not necessarily meager.\n*   If the composants are not meager, the Baire Category argument fails, and there is no contradiction in the space being a union of a small number of them (like two).\n*   This opens the possibility that a non-metric indecomposable continuum could exist with a finite number of composants.\n\n### Step 5: Finding an Example\n\nSince the lower bound is 2, we must check if an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants can exist.\n\n*   The existence of such a space is a known result in continuum theory.\n*   Topologists (e.g., M. Smith in a 1990 paper) have constructed examples of non-metric, compact, connected, Hausdorff spaces that are indecomposable and have exactly two composants.\n*   These constructions are typically complex, often involving inverse limits of non-metric spaces.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. So the minimum number is at least 2.\n2.  For metric continua, the number must be uncountable ($c$).\n3.  For non-metric continua, the argument forcing an uncountable number of composants fails.\n4.  Examples have been constructed of non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly 2 composants.\n5.  Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum (when not restricted to be metric) is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
