    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\n**Fundamental Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization**\n\nCoiled-coils consist of alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their structure is defined by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern called a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The oligomeric state (i.e., the number of helices: dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by the identity and packing of amino acids at the core positions, 'a' and 'd'.\n\n*   **Core Packing:** The 'a' and 'd' positions form the hydrophobic core. The size and shape of their side chains are critical.\n    *   **Beta-branched residues** (Isoleucine - I, Valine - V, Threonine - T) are bulky near the protein backbone.\n    *   **Non-beta-branched residues** (Leucine - L, Alanine - A, Methionine - M) are less bulky near the backbone.\n*   **Key Rules:**\n    1.  **Dimer Formation:** Dimers are often formed when one core position is beta-branched and the other is not (e.g., 'a'=I, 'd'=L or 'a'=I, 'd'=A). The classic \"Leucine Zipper\" with Leucine at the 'd' position is a canonical dimer. This allows for efficient \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n    2.  **Trimer/Tetramer Formation:** When both 'a' and 'd' positions are occupied by bulky, beta-branched residues (e.g., 'a'=I, 'd'=I or 'a'=I, 'd'=V), the steric clash prevents tight packing in a dimer. The helices splay apart, favoring the geometry of trimers or tetramers.\n    3.  **Polar Core Residues:** Polar residues like Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q), or Threonine (T) in the core can form hydrogen-bond networks that specify a particular oligomeric state.\n    4.  **Electrostatic Interactions:** Charged residues at positions 'e' and 'g' can form stabilizing salt bridges between helices, often contributing to dimer stability.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence**\n\nFor all sequences, the repeating `EIA...K/Q` pattern suggests a consistent heptad register where `I` is at the 'a' position and the preceding `E` is at the 'g' position.\n\n**1. Sequence: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Heptad Register:** `(IAQALKE)`\n*   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I\n*   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** A, A, W, A\n*   **Analysis:** The 'a' position is consistently Isoleucine (I), a beta-branched residue. The 'd' position is predominantly Alanine (A), a small, non-beta-branched residue. This `a=I, d=A` pairing allows for very efficient knobs-into-holes packing, which is a classic hallmark of a **dimer**.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **2 (Dimer)**\n\n**2. Sequence: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Register:** `(IAALKQE)`\n*   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, N, I\n*   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** L, L, L, L\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Leucine Zipper, with the 'd' positions entirely occupied by Leucine (L). The `d=L` motif is a very strong determinant for **dimerization**. The single Asparagine (N) at an 'a' position can also form a stabilizing inter-chain hydrogen bond in a parallel dimer.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **2 (Dimer)**\n\n**3. Sequence: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Register:** `(IAAIKQE)`\n*   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I\n*   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** I, I, W, I\n*   **Analysis:** Both the 'a' and 'd' core positions are dominated by the beta-branched residue Isoleucine (I). Packing two bulky beta-branched residues against each other creates steric hindrance that destabilizes a dimer. This packing arrangement is highly favorable for a **tetramer**, as seen in model systems like GCN4-pII.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **4 (Tetramer)**\n\n**4. Sequence: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Heptad Register:** `(IQKQLKE)`\n*   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I\n*   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** Q, Q, W, Q\n*   **Analysis:** This case is more complex. The `a=I` position suggests a preference for an oligomer higher than a dimer due to steric bulk. The `d=Q` (Glutamine) is polar. Polar layers of Q often specify trimers or tetramers. However, we must also consider the flanking 'e' and 'g' positions:\n    *   'e' positions (6, 13, 20, 27): K, K, L, K (Lysine, positive charge)\n    *   'g' positions (1, 8, 15, 22): E, E, E, E (Glutamate, negative charge)\n    The strong pattern of oppositely charged residues at the 'e' and 'g' positions creates powerful electrostatic attractions (salt bridges) that are optimally formed in a parallel **dimer**. This strong dimer-specifying interaction likely overrides the less favorable core packing.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **2 (Dimer)**\n\n**5. Sequence: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Heptad Register:** `(IAQTLKE)`\n*   **'a' positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I\n*   **'d' positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** T, T, W, T\n*   **Analysis:** The 'a' position is Isoleucine (I) and the 'd' position is predominantly Threonine (T). Both I and T are beta-branched amino acids. As with sequence 3, this creates steric hindrance in a dimer. The `a=I, d=T` combination is structurally very similar to the `a=I, d=V` motif, which is a well-established signal for **trimer** formation. The polar hydroxyl group on Threonine can further stabilize the trimeric core through a hydrogen-bond network.\n*   **Oligomeric State:** **3 (Trimer)**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the predicted oligomeric states for the five sequences are: 2, 2, 4, 2, and 3. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
