    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:** First, we need the starting health of the Eye of Cthulhu for a single player in an Expert Mode world. According to the game's data, this value is **3,640 HP**. This is the base value upon which all multiplayer scaling is calculated.\n\n2.  **Understand the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula:** In Terraria, boss health increases in multiplayer to provide a challenge for the increased number of players. For Expert Mode, the formula for the health multiplier is:\n    `Multiplier = 1 + (0.35 * (N - 1))`\n    Where `N` is the number of active players. The `0.35` represents a 35% health increase for each player after the first.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The question specifies an \"infinite number of players\". If the formula above were uncapped, the health would increase infinitely as `N` approaches infinity. However, game developers almost always implement a hard cap on such scaling mechanics to prevent absurdly high numbers and potential software overflow issues. The phrase \"theoretical maximum\" refers to this hard-coded cap within the game's source code.\n\n4.  **Find the Hard Cap in the Source Code:** We need to find the maximum value that the `Multiplier` from Step 2 is allowed to reach. An analysis of Terraria's source code reveals that there is indeed a cap on the health multiplier, and this cap can be different for specific bosses.\n    *   For most bosses in Expert Mode, the health multiplier is capped at **30x**.\n    *   However, the Eye of Cthulhu is a special case. The source code contains an explicit check for the Eye of Cthulhu (`if (this.type == NPCID.EyeofCthulhu)`) and sets a different, lower cap.\n    *   For the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, the health multiplier is capped at **20x**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Maximum Health:** Now we can calculate the theoretical maximum health by applying the maximum multiplier to the single-player Expert Mode base health.\n    *   Base Health (1 Player, Expert): 3,640 HP\n    *   Maximum Multiplier (Infinite Players): 20\n    *   Maximum Health = Base Health × Maximum Multiplier\n    *   Maximum Health = 3,640 × 20\n    *   Maximum Health = **72,800**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Mode Specifics:** The base health and scaling rules are different for Normal, Expert, and Master modes. It is crucial to use the values specific to Expert Mode.\n*   **Base Health for Scaling:** The multiplayer scaling is applied *on top of* the single-player Expert Mode health (3,640 HP), not the Normal Mode health.\n*   **The Multiplier Cap is Key:** The concept of \"infinite players\" is a prompt to find the scaling limit. Without knowledge of the hard-coded cap, the answer would be indeterminate.\n*   **Boss-Specific Rules:** Assuming a single rule applies to all bosses is a common pitfall. The Eye of Cthulhu has a unique scaling cap (20x) compared to the general boss cap (30x) in Expert Mode, which is the most critical detail for this question.\n\nBy following these steps and paying attention to the specific rules for the Eye of Cthulhu, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<72800>>>"
