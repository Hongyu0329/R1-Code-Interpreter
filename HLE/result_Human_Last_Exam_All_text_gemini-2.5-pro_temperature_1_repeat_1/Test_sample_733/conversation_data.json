    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Group (G):** A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverse elements. We consider only finite groups.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `a, b` in `S` (including `a=b`), the product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S ∩ (S.S) = ∅`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (S):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for the number of non-isomorphic finite groups `G` that have a maximal product-free set `S` where `|S| = 2`.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Conditions**\n\nLet `S = {a, b}` be a maximal product-free set of size 2 in a finite group `G`.\n\n*   **Product-Free Condition:**\n    1.  `a^2 ∉ {a, b}`\n    2.  `ab ∉ {a, b}`\n    3.  `ba ∉ {a, b}`\n    4.  `b^2 ∉ {a, b}`\n    A consequence of this is that neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element `e`. (If `a=e`, then `a^2 = a`, violating the condition).\n\n*   **Maximality Condition:**\n    For any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `T = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` is not product-free. This means there exist `x, y ∈ T` such that `xy ∈ T`.\n    Since `S` is product-free, this implies that any new product involving `g` must fall into `T`, or one of the old products from `S.S` must be equal to `g`.\n    So, for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, at least one of the following must hold:\n    1.  `g ∈ S.S = {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}`.\n    2.  `ag ∈ S ∪ {g}` (i.e., `ag=a`, `ag=b`, or `ag=g`). Since `g≠e`, `ag=a` is impossible. Since `a≠e`, `ag=g` is impossible. So this simplifies to `ag=b`.\n    3.  `ga ∈ S ∪ {g}` (simplifies to `ga=b`).\n    4.  `bg ∈ S ∪ {g}` (simplifies to `bg=a`).\n    5.  `gb ∈ S ∪ {g}` (simplifies to `gb=a`).\n    6.  `g^2 ∈ S ∪ {g}` (simplifies to `g^2=a`, `g^2=b`, or `g^2=g`). `g^2=g` implies `g=e`.\n\n    Combining these, for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, one of the following must be true:\n    *   `g ∈ {a^2, ab, ba, b^2}`\n    *   `g = a⁻¹b` or `g = ba⁻¹`\n    *   `g = b⁻¹a` or `g = ab⁻¹`\n    *   `g^2 = a` or `g^2 = b`\n    *   `g = e` (The identity `e` is always a `g` to check, and `{a,b,e}` is never product-free since `ae=a`).\n\nThis framework allows us to test candidate groups.\n\n**3. Case-by-Case Analysis of Small Groups**\n\nWe test non-isomorphic groups of small order.\n\n*   **Order 1, 2, 3:** No sets of size 2, or no product-free sets of size 2 (`C_3`: any set `{x, x^2}` is not product-free as `x*x=x^2`).\n\n*   **Order 4:**\n    *   `G = C_4 = {e, x, x^2, x^3}`. Let `S = {x, x^3}`. `S.S = {x^2, e}`. `S` is product-free. `G\\S = {e, x^2}`. Both elements are in `S.S`. Thus, for any `g ∈ G\\S`, `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. So `S` is maximal. **`C_4` works.**\n    *   `G = C_2 × C_2 = {e, a, b, ab}`. Let `S = {a, b}`. `S.S = {e, ab}`. `S` is product-free. `G\\S = {e, ab}`. Both elements are in `S.S`. Thus, `S` is maximal. **`C_2 × C_2` works.**\n\n*   **Order 5:**\n    *   `G = C_5 = {e, x, x^2, x^3, x^4}`. Let `S = {x, x^4}`. `S.S = {x^2, e, x^3}`. `S` is product-free. `G = S ∪ S.S`. Thus, `S` is maximal. **`C_5` works.** (Another such set is `{x^2, x^3}`).\n\n*   **Order 6:**\n    *   `G = C_6`. Let `S = {x, x^4}`. `S.S = {x^2, x^5}`. `S` is product-free. `G\\S = {e, x^2, x^3, x^5}`.\n        - `g=e`: trivial.\n        - `g=x^2`: `x*x=x^2`. Not PF.\n        - `g=x^3`: `x*x^3 = x^4 ∈ S`. Not PF.\n        - `g=x^5`: `x*x^4 = x^5`. Not PF.\n        Thus, `S` is maximal. **`C_6` works.**\n    *   `G = S_3 = {e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)}`. Let `S = {(12), (123)}`. `S.S = {e, (23), (13), (132)}`. `S` is product-free. `G\\S = {e, (13), (23), (132)}`. Since `G\\S = S.S`, `S` is maximal. **`S_3` works.**\n\n*   **Order 7:**\n    *   `G = C_7`. Let `S = {x, x^6}`. `S.S = {x^2, e, x^5}`. `G\\S = {e, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5}`. We can verify for `g=x^3` (`x^6*x^3=x^9=x^2 \\in S.S`) and `g=x^4` (`x*x^4=x^5 \\in S.S`). All elements of `G\\S` \"destroy\" the product-free property. Thus, `S` is maximal. **`C_7` works.**\n\n*   **Order 8:**\n    *   `G = C_8`. Let `S = {x^2, x^6}`. `S.S = {x^4, e}`. `S` is product-free. `G\\S = {e, x, x^3, x^4, x^5, x^7}`. A full check shows that for every `g ∈ G\\S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. For instance, for `g=x`, `x^2 \\in S` means `x` is a square root of an element in `S`. The maximality conditions cover all elements in `G\\S`. Thus, `S` is maximal. **`C_8` works.**\n    *   `G = D_4` (Dihedral group of order 8). No such set exists. Any choice of `S` leaves a `g` such that `S ∪ {g}` is product-free.\n    *   `G = Q_8` (Quaternion group). No such set exists.\n    *   `G = C_4 × C_2`. No such set exists.\n    *   `G = C_2 × C_2 × C_2`. No such set exists.\n\n*   **Order > 8:**\n    *   Systematic analysis shows that no other cyclic groups work. For `C_n`, the condition `n-2 ≤ |S.S| + |{g|...}|` provides bounds `n ≤ 10` for odd `n` and `n ≤ 12` for even `n`. Case analysis of `C_9, C_10, C_11, C_12` shows they do not work.\n    *   No other non-abelian groups of order up to 12 work either upon detailed checking.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n\n1.  `C_4` (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `C_2 × C_2` (Klein four-group)\n3.  `C_5` (Cyclic group of order 5)\n4.  `C_6` (Cyclic group of order 6)\n5.  `S_3` (Symmetric group on 3 elements, isomorphic to `D_3`)\n6.  `C_7` (Cyclic group of order 7)\n7.  `C_8` (Cyclic group of order 8)\n\nThese are 7 distinct non-isomorphic groups."
