    "This question requires us to determine the linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark and then find all African national flags that have the same rank. The problem specifies that we should assume the values representing colors in the flag matrices are chosen to maximize the rank. This means the rank is determined purely by the geometric structure of the flag, and not by any coincidental linear relationships between the numerical values chosen for the colors.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the rank of the flag of Denmark.**\n\n1.  **Visualize the Flag:** The flag of Denmark is a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is composed of a vertical stripe and a horizontal stripe.\n2.  **Represent as a Matrix:** Imagine the flag as a grid of pixels, forming a matrix. Each entry in the matrix corresponds to a color.\n3.  **Analyze the Rows:** Let's consider the possible patterns for any horizontal row in this matrix.\n    *   A row that intersects the horizontal bar of the white cross will be entirely white. Let's call this row pattern **P1 = [White, White, White, ...]**.\n    *   A row that does not intersect the horizontal bar of the cross will be mostly red, but interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross. Let's call this pattern **P2 = [Red, ..., Red, White, Red, ..., Red]**.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** Every single row in the matrix of the Danish flag conforms to one of these two patterns, P1 or P2. These two patterns are linearly independent (one cannot be created by scaling the other, as they contain different sets of colors). Since the entire set of rows can be described by combinations of these two fundamental, linearly independent patterns, the dimension of the row space is 2. Therefore, the rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n**Step 2: Find African flags with a rank of 2.**\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose geometric design results in exactly two linearly independent row or column patterns.\n\n1.  **Flags with 3 or more distinct horizontal/vertical stripes:** Flags like those of Gabon (3 horizontal stripes of different colors) or Cameroon (3 vertical stripes of different colors) will have a rank of 3, as they have three distinct row/column patterns. This eliminates a large number of flags.\n\n2.  **Flags with complex geometry:** Flags with diagonal stripes (e.g., Tanzania, Namibia), multiple fimbriations (e.g., Botswana, Kenya), or complex symbols (e.g., South Africa) create many different row/column patterns, resulting in ranks higher than 2.\n\n3.  **Flags with a monochrome field and a central emblem:** Flags like Morocco (red field, green star) or Somalia (blue field, white star) might seem simple. However, a row that doesn't touch the emblem is one pattern (e.g., all-red). A row that just touches the tip of the star is a second pattern. A row that cuts across a wider part of the star is a third, different pattern. This leads to a rank greater than 2.\n\n4.  **Flags with exactly two distinct patterns:** We need to find flags whose design is simple enough to only generate two patterns.\n    *   **Nigeria (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬):** This flag has three vertical stripes: Green, White, Green.\n        *   Analyzing the columns: Any column is either entirely Green or entirely White.\n        *   This gives exactly two distinct column patterns. These are linearly independent.\n        *   Therefore, the rank of Nigeria's flag is 2.\n    *   **Benin (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¯):** This flag has a vertical green band on the left and two horizontal bands (yellow and red) on the right.\n        *   Analyzing the rows: Any row consists of a green section on the left and a section on the right. The right section is either yellow (for the top half of the flag) or red (for the bottom half).\n        *   This gives exactly two distinct row patterns: [Green, Yellow] and [Green, Red]. These are linearly independent.\n        *   Therefore, the rank of Benin's flag is 2.\n    *   **Madagascar (ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¬):** This flag has a vertical white band on the left and two horizontal bands (red and green) on the right.\n        *   The structure is identical to Benin's flag.\n        *   This gives exactly two distinct row patterns: [White, Red] and [White, Green]. These are linearly independent.\n        *   Therefore, the rank of Madagascar's flag is 2.\n\nOther flags, such as Guinea-Bissau or Sao Tome and Principe, have similar base designs but include emblems (stars) that add complexity, creating additional distinct row/column patterns and thus resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe rank of the Danish flag is 2. The African flags whose geometric structure also results in a rank of 2 are Nigeria, Benin, and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria>>>"
