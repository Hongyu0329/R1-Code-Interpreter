    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the name of a physicist with several specific identifiers:\n    *   **Field:** Primarily known for work in microscopy.\n    *   **Discovery:** An optical effect related to real imagery.\n    *   **Origin Story:** The effect was first accidentally noticed by a custodial worker.\n    *   **Apparatus:** The observation involved the cleaning of concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Clue:** The most distinctive and unusual piece of information is the anecdote about the custodial worker and the concave mirror. This specific story is the key to finding the right person, as it's not a common event in the history of science.\n\n3.  **Brainstorm and Research Candidates:** We need to consider physicists famous for their contributions to microscopy.\n    *   **Ernst Abbe:** A German physicist who made fundamental contributions to the design of optical microscopes, particularly the theory of the diffraction limit. While he worked with optics, the specific anecdote does not match his history.\n    *   **Ernst Ruska:** A German physicist who won the Nobel Prize for his work in electron optics and the design of the first electron microscope. This is not optical microscopy and doesn't involve concave mirrors in this context.\n    *   **Robert Hooke:** An English scientist and a pioneer in microscopy, but the anecdote doesn't align with his known discoveries in the 17th century.\n    *   **Frits Zernike:** A Dutch physicist. This is a very strong candidate. He is famous for inventing the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n4.  **Verify the Anecdote with the Prime Candidate:** Let's research the connection between Frits Zernike and the story.\n    *   Zernike was studying diffraction gratings using a telescope setup that included a high-quality concave mirror.\n    *   The story goes that a janitor was polishing the mirror, and Zernike, observing from the focal point, noticed that the faint scratches and smudges on the mirror's surface became strikingly visible. In some versions of the story, Zernike himself made the observation while testing the mirror.\n    *   He realized he was seeing phase objectsâ€”imperfections too small to block light (affect its amplitude) but large enough to slightly delay the light waves passing through or reflecting off them (affect their phase).\n    *   This observation was the crucial insight. He understood that if he could devise a method to convert these invisible phase shifts into visible changes in brightness (amplitude), he could see transparent structures, like living cells, without staining them.\n\n5.  **Connect the Clues and Confirm:**\n    *   **Physicist known for microscopy?** Yes, Frits Zernike won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope. This is his most famous work.\n    *   **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery?** Yes, the principle of phase contrast, which he observed in the real image formed by the concave mirror.\n    *   **Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?** Yes, this exact anecdote is widely cited as the inspiration for his discovery.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** All the points in the question align perfectly with the story of Frits Zernike's breakthrough that led to the development of the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
