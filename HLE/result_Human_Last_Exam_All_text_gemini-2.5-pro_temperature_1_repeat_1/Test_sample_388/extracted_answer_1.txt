The pharmacist should counsel Allison on the potential drug interaction between her Fluoxetine and the aspirin contained in the Excedrin. The combination of an SSRI (Fluoxetine) and an NSAID (aspirin) significantly increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The pharmacist should recommend that for future headaches, she use a safer alternative like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and advise her to speak with her doctor if the headaches continue, as they could be a side effect of the Fluoxetine or the Junel Fe.
