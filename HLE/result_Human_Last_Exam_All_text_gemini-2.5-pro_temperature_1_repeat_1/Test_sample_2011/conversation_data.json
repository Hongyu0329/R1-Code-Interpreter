    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` that has exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n\nLet's break down the key terms:\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** A graph `G` with a set of vertices `V` where `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). A clique of size `s` is a complete graph `K_s`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** An induced subgraph on a subset of vertices `S` consists of `S` and *all* the edges from the original graph `G` that connect vertices within `S`.\n*   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** If a set of `s` vertices forms a clique, the induced subgraph on these `s` vertices is, by definition, a complete graph `K_s`. The terms \"contains a clique of size `s`\" and \"contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_s`\" are equivalent.\n*   **Maximum number of different clique sizes:** We need to find a single graph `G` on 128 vertices that contains cliques of sizes `s_1, s_2, ..., s_k`. All the `s_i` values must be different, and we want to find the largest possible value for `k`.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Careful Points and Constraints\n\n1.  **Vertex Limit:** The total number of vertices is fixed at `n = 128`.\n2.  **Clique Size Limit:** To have a clique of size `s`, a graph must have at least `s` vertices. Since our graph has 128 vertices, any clique within it can have a size of at most 128. So, `1 <= s <= 128`.\n3.  **Distinct Sizes:** We are counting the number of *unique* or *different* sizes. For example, if a graph has three cliques of size 5, this only contributes one `(s=5)` to our count of different sizes.\n4.  **The Goal is Maximization:** We are not looking for a property that all graphs on 128 vertices have. Instead, we are looking for the best-case scenario â€“ we need to find (or prove the existence of) a specific graph that maximizes this count.\n\n### Step 3: Establishing an Upper Bound\n\nFrom the careful points above, we know that any clique in a graph on 128 vertices must have a size `s` such that `1 <= s <= 128`. The possible integer sizes for a clique are therefore {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}.\nThe total number of these possible sizes is 128.\nA single graph cannot have more than 128 different clique sizes, as there are only 128 possibilities in total.\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is **at most 128**.\n\n### Step 4: Proving the Upper Bound is Achievable (Constructive Proof)\n\nNow we need to determine if it's possible to construct a graph on 128 vertices that actually contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted as `K_128`.\n*   `K_128` has 128 vertices.\n*   In `K_128`, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's check if `K_{128}` contains cliques of all the required sizes.\nLet `s` be any integer such that `1 <= s <= 128`.\n*   Can we find a clique of size `s` in `K_{128}`?\n*   Yes. We can simply choose any subset of `s` vertices from the 128 vertices of `K_{128}`.\n*   Let this subset of vertices be `V'`. Since `|V'| = s`, and in the original graph `K_{128}` every vertex is connected to every other vertex, it follows that within the subset `V'`, every vertex is connected to every other vertex in `V'`.\n*   This means that the subgraph induced by `V'` is a complete graph of size `s`, or `K_s`.\n\nSince we can do this for any `s` from 1 to 128, the graph `K_{128}` contains cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., 128.\nThe set of different clique sizes that appear in `K_{128}` is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}.\nThe number of elements in this set is 128.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  We established an upper bound: The maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph on 128 vertices cannot exceed 128.\n2.  We found a specific graph, the complete graph `K_{128}`, which achieves this upper bound by containing cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
