    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a dance style where a specific move, the \"reverse turn\" (a turn to the left), cannot be \"overturned\" (turned more than the standard amount) without breaking the fundamental \"technique\" of that dance.\n\n**Step 2: Define Key Terms**\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing where the couple rotates to the left.\n*   **Overturn:** To perform a turn with more rotation than is prescribed in the standard technical manual for that figure. For example, turning a full 360 degrees on a figure that normally turns 270 degrees.\n*   **Disregarding the Technique:** This means violating the foundational principles and characteristic style of the dance. This could involve incorrect footwork, timing, body action (like rise & fall or sway), or posture.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Dance Style**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This is a fast, rotational dance. The technique is built entirely around continuous turning. While the standard figures have prescribed amounts of turn, the entire dance is about rotation. Overturning a figure would be extremely difficult due to the speed, but it would still be a rotational action, which is consistent with the dance's character. It's not *impossible* to add more rotation without changing the fundamental nature of the movement, just very challenging.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** This is a \"swing\" dance characterized by its flowing movement, body sway, and prominent rise and fall. Overturning a reverse turn is a very common and accepted variation, especially at the corners of the room. It is achieved by using advanced technique, specifically by increasing the amount of body sway and rotation. Therefore, overturning is possible *with* good technique, not by disregarding it.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** This dance is unique among the standard dances. Its technique is defined by what it *lacks*: there is no rise and fall, no body sway, and the movement is staccato (sharp and punctuated), not flowing. Turns are executed with sharp, deliberate steps and foot placements, keeping the feet in contact with the floor. To overturn a turn, one would need to generate continuous rotational momentum, which typically requires swing and sway. Introducing swing and sway into a Tango figure is a fundamental violation of its core technique. The staccato, grounded nature of the dance makes a smooth overturn impossible without changing the dance's character entirely.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, this is a \"swing\" dance that emphasizes smooth, continuous, gliding movements. Overturning figures like the reverse turn is a well-established part of advanced choreography. It requires a masterful application of swing and sway, which are integral parts of Foxtrot technique. Thus, it is possible to overturn without disregarding the technique.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is a fast, dynamic \"swing\" dance. It uses strong momentum, and advanced figures often involve overturned rotations to create a flashy and energetic look. The principles of swing and body flight are central to the technique, and overturning is an extension of these principles.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Analysis and Conclude**\nThe \"swing\" dances (English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep) all use principles of momentum, swing, and sway, which can be exaggerated in advanced technique to achieve an overturn. Therefore, in these dances, overturning is possible within the technical framework.\n\nThe European Tango stands apart. Its technique explicitly prohibits the very elements (sway, continuous flow) that are necessary to smoothly overturn a turn. Attempting to do so would force a dancer to abandon the staccato, grounded, and sharp characteristics of the dance, thereby \"disregarding the technique.\"\n\nTherefore, the European Tango is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
