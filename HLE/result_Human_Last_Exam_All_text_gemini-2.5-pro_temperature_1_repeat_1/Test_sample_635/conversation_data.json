    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix:\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ is non-singular (i.e., $\\det(D(s))$ is not identically zero).\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n**Careful Point:** The condition $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is equivalent to $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. This form is more convenient to work with because it requires that the product $D(s)H(s)$ results in a matrix $N(s)$ where all entries are polynomials.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 2.1: Set up the equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$**\n\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. We multiply it by $H(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor this product to be a polynomial matrix $N(s)$, all its entries must be polynomials.\n\n**Step 2.2: Find the conditions on the entries of D(s)**\n\nThe common denominator for all terms in $H(s)$ is $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$.\nLet's analyze the entries of the product matrix:\n*   The entries $N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials. This is already satisfied by the definition of $D(s)$.\n*   The entry $N_{11}(s) = d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This means the numerator must be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n    *   At $s=1$: The numerator must be zero. $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 2d_{12}(1) = 0$. This implies $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n    *   At $s=-1$: The numerator must be zero. $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0$, which simplifies to $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n*   The entry $N_{21}(s) = d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This gives similar conditions for the second row of $D(s)$:\n    *   $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n    *   $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**Step 2.3: Construct a minimal D(s) satisfying the conditions**\n\nWe need to find the simplest non-trivial polynomial entries for $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions.\n*   **For the first row $[d_{11}(s) \\quad d_{12}(s)]$**:\n    Let's try to find a simple solution. If we set $d_{12}(s)=0$, the first condition ($d_{12}(1)=0$) is met. The second condition becomes $2d_{11}(-1) + 0 = 0$, which means $d_{11}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s+1)$. The simplest polynomial for $d_{11}(s)$ is $s+1$.\n    So, a candidate for the first row is $[s+1 \\quad 0]$.\n\n*   **For the second row $[d_{21}(s) \\quad d_{22}(s)]$**:\n    We need $d_{22}(s)$ to have a factor $(s-1)$ and $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$. We also need to ensure that the resulting $D(s)$ is non-singular.\n    Let's try the simplest possible choice for $d_{22}(s)$, which is $d_{22}(s) = s-1$.\n    Substituting this into the second condition: $2d_{21}(-1) + (-1-1) = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d_{21}(-1) - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow d_{21}(-1) = 1$.\n    The simplest polynomial for $d_{21}(s)$ that satisfies $d_{21}(-1)=1$ is the constant polynomial $d_{21}(s) = 1$.\n    So, a candidate for the second row is $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\nThis gives us the matrix $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Careful Point:** We must check if this $D(s)$ is non-singular.\n$\\det(D(s)) = (s+1)(s-1) - (0)(1) = s^2-1$. Since this is not identically zero, $D(s)$ is non-singular.\n\n**Step 2.4: Calculate N(s)**\n\nNow we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} (s+1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + 0 & (s+1)(1) + 0 \\\\ (1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & (1)(1) + 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ \\frac{s+1}{s+1} & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**3. Verify Coprimeness**\n\nTo confirm this is a *coprime* factorization, we must check that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. A standard method is to check that the compound matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$. We only need to test the values of $s$ that are roots of $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1 = 0$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\nThe compound matrix is:\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n*   **Test at s = 1:**\n    \\[\n    [D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The rows are linearly independent (e.g., the submatrix from columns 1 and 3 is $\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, with determinant 2). Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n*   **Test at s = -1:**\n    \\[\n    [D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The rows are linearly independent (e.g., the submatrix from columns 1 and 3 is $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, with determinant 2). Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ does not drop for any complex $s$, the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by the polynomial matrices:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}, N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}>>>"
