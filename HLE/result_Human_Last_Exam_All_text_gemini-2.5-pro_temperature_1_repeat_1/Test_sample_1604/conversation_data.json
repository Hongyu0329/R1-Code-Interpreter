    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist and Her Subject Matter**\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was a famous British painter who specialized in military and battle scenes. The question asks for the latest *historical event* she depicted, not the latest painting she created.\n\n**Step 2: List Major Battle Paintings by Lady Butler and their Historical Dates**\nWe need to compile a list of her well-known paintings and identify the specific battle and its date for each one.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, **16 June 1815**.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, **18 June 1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War, **5 November 1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, **25 October 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War, **22-23 January 1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1898): Depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War, **28 January 1881**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): Depicts the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War, **13 September 1882**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted c. 1893): Depicts the British Camel Corps during the Nile Expedition of **1884–1885**, sent to relieve Khartoum.\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted in the 1920s): Depicts the Great Retreat during the First World War, which took place in **August 1914**.\n*   ***To the Memory of the Victor of the Battle of the Marne*** (painted c. 1914-1918): This painting is a tribute related to the First Battle of the Marne, which took place from **6–12 September 1914**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates of the Battles**\nNow, we arrange the battles in chronological order to find the latest one.\n\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras: 1815\n2.  Battle of Waterloo: 1815\n3.  Battle of Balaclava / Inkerman (Crimean War): 1854\n4.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: 1879\n5.  Battle of Laing's Nek: 1881\n6.  Battle of Tel El Kebir: 1882\n7.  Nile Expedition: 1884-1885\n8.  Retreat from Mons (WWI): August 1914\n9.  First Battle of the Marne (WWI): September 1914\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\nBy comparing the dates, it is clear that the events from the First World War (1914) are the latest historical conflicts Lady Butler depicted. Between the two specific events from 1914, the First Battle of the Marne (September 1914) occurred after the Retreat from Mons (August 1914).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The analysis must distinguish between the date a work was painted and the date of the historical event it portrays. For example, *Scotland for Ever!* was painted in 1881 but depicts the Battle of Waterloo from 1815.\n*   One must look at the full scope of her career. Lady Butler lived through the First World War and created works related to it, which are crucial for answering the question correctly.\n*   Some titles may be tributes rather than direct depictions, but they are still linked to a specific historical battle. *To the Memory of the Victor of the Battle of the Marne* clearly refers to that specific battle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the First Battle of the Marne.\n\n<<<The First Battle of the Marne>>>"
