No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not radial due to the Parker Spiral. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is an approximation made for computational convenience, not a reflection of the physical orientation of the magnetic field. The physically correct method is to use components perpendicular to the local background magnetic field direction.
