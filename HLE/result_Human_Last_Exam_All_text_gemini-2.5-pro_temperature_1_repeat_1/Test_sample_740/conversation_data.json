    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the integral equation to find the values of $\\lambda$ for which it has no solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integral equation and its kernel.**\nThe given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$, for $0 \\le x \\le 1$.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, $u(x) = f(x) + \\lambda \\int_a^b K(x, y) u(y) dy$, with $f(x)=1$ and the kernel $K(x,y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\nThe kernel can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series or polynomial division:\n$K(x, y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + \\dots + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n\nThis shows that the kernel is separable (or degenerate), as it is a finite sum of products of functions of $x$ and functions of $y$.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the integral equation into a system of linear equations.**\nSubstitute the separable kernel back into the equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k \\right) u(y) dy$\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\left( \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy \\right)$.\n\nLet's define the constants $c_k$ as the moments of the function $u(y)$:\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nThe solution $u(x)$ must then have the form of a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\n\nTo find the unknown constants $c_k$, we substitute this expression for $u(x)$ back into their definitions. For each $j = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$:\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j u(y) dy = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left( 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k} \\right) dy$\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^j y^{n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^{j+n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$.\n\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknowns $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$. We can write it in matrix form as $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where:\n- $\\mathbf{c}$ is the column vector $[c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}]^T$.\n- $\\mathbf{b}$ is the column vector $[1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots, 1/n]^T$, with $b_j = \\frac{1}{j+1}$.\n- $A$ is the $n \\times n$ matrix with elements $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem.**\nThe system of linear equations $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution for $\\mathbf{c}$ if the determinant of the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is non-zero. If $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$, the system either has no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem:\n1.  If $\\det(I - \\lambda A) \\neq 0$, a unique solution $u(x)$ exists for any $f(x)$. The values of $\\lambda$ for which this is true are called regular values.\n2.  If $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$, a solution exists if and only if the forcing term $f(x)=1$ is \"orthogonal\" to all solutions of the homogeneous adjoint equation. Otherwise, no solution exists. The values of $\\lambda$ for which the determinant is zero are the characteristic values.\n\nThe condition $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$ is equivalent to $\\det(A - \\frac{1}{\\lambda}I) = 0$, which means $1/\\lambda$ must be an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the condition for no solution.**\nThe adjoint homogeneous equation corresponds to the linear system $(I - \\lambda A^T)\\mathbf{z} = 0$. A solution to our inhomogeneous problem exists if and only if $\\mathbf{b}$ is orthogonal to all vectors $\\mathbf{z}$ in the null space of $(I - \\lambda A^T)$. That is, $\\mathbf{z}^T \\mathbf{b} = 0$.\nIf $\\mathbf{z}^T \\mathbf{b} \\neq 0$, the equation has no solution.\n\nThe kernel $K(x,y) = \\sum x^{n-1-k}y^k$ is symmetric, i.e., $K(x,y) = K(y,x)$. This means the integral operator is self-adjoint. However, the matrix $A$ we derived is not symmetric. Let's verify the adjoint condition from the integral equation perspective. The condition for a solution to exist is $\\int_0^1 f(x) v(x) dx = 0$ for all solutions $v(x)$ of the homogeneous adjoint equation $v(x) = \\bar{\\lambda} \\int_0^1 K(y,x) v(y) dy$. Since $K$ is real and symmetric, this is just $v(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x,y) v(y) dy$.\nThe condition becomes $\\int_0^1 1 \\cdot v(x) dx \\neq 0$ for an eigenfunction $v(x)$ corresponding to $\\lambda$.\nThe integral $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx$ is precisely the constant $c_0$ for the homogeneous solution, let's call it $c_0^{(h)}$. So, no solution exists if $c_0^{(h)} \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the homogeneous system $(I - \\lambda A)\\mathbf{c}^{(h)} = 0$. A non-trivial solution $\\mathbf{c}^{(h)}$ exists for characteristic values of $\\lambda$. We need to check if $c_0^{(h)}$ can be zero for any of these solutions.\nThe first equation of the homogeneous system (for $j=0$) is:\n$c_0^{(h)} = \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k^{(h)}}{n-k}$.\nIf $c_0^{(h)} = 0$, then $\\lambda \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k^{(h)}}{n-k} = 0$. This implies that a non-trivial eigenvector $[c_1^{(h)}, ..., c_{n-1}^{(h)}]$ of a submatrix must be orthogonal to a specific vector. While this is possible in principle, it is a strong constraint.\n\nLet's test for small $n$.\n-   **Case n=1:** The equation is $(1-\\lambda)c_0 = 1$. If $\\lambda=1$, we get $0=1$, which is impossible. So, no solution for $\\lambda=1$.\n-   **Case n=2:** The system for $\\mathbf{c}=[c_0, c_1]^T$ is\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda/2 & -\\lambda \\\\ -\\lambda/3 & 1-\\lambda/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_0 \\\\ c_1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The determinant is $D(\\lambda) = (1-\\lambda/2)^2 - \\lambda^2/3 = 1-\\lambda-\\lambda^2/12$.\n    Setting $D(\\lambda)=0$ gives $\\lambda^2+12\\lambda-12=0$, with roots $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$. These are the characteristic values.\n    For these values, we must check the solvability condition. The adjoint system is $(I-\\lambda A^T)\\mathbf{z}=0$.\n    The condition for no solution is $\\mathbf{z}^T \\mathbf{b} \\neq 0$. For $n=2$, this was shown to be true for both characteristic values in the thought process. A simpler way: the condition for a solution to exist is that $c_0^{(h)}=0$ for the homogeneous solution vector. The homogeneous system is $(1-\\lambda/2)c_0^{(h)} - \\lambda c_1^{(h)}=0$ and $(-\\lambda/3)c_0^{(h)} + (1-\\lambda/2)c_1^{(h)}=0$. If $c_0^{(h)}=0$, the first equation gives $\\lambda c_1^{(h)}=0$. Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, this means $c_1^{(h)}=0$. So $\\mathbf{c}^{(h)}=0$, which contradicts it being a non-trivial solution for a characteristic value. Thus, $c_0^{(h)}$ cannot be zero.\n    Therefore, for both characteristic values $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$, no solution exists.\n\n**Conclusion for the general case:**\nThe argument for $n=2$ suggests that for any characteristic value $\\lambda$, the first component $c_0^{(h)}$ of the corresponding homogeneous solution vector is non-zero. This means the condition $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx \\neq 0$ holds. Consequently, for any characteristic value $\\lambda$, the integral equation has no solution.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding these characteristic values of $\\lambda$. They are the roots of the polynomial equation $\\det(I-\\lambda A)=0$. These are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$, where $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are the $n$ characteristic values of the integral equation, which are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ defined by $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$."
