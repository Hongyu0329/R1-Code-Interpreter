    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the etymological development of the PIE root *seh₂g- into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Root**\n*   **Root:** *seh₂g-\n*   **Meaning:** 'to track, trace, seek out'. The example form *seh₂gieti '(s)he’s giving a sign' and its cognates (Latin *sāgīre* 'to perceive keenly') confirm this meaning.\n*   **Phonology:**\n    *   *s: Voiceless alveolar sibilant.\n    *   *eh₂: The vowel *e* followed by the laryngeal *h₂*. The *h₂* laryngeal \"colors\" a preceding or following *e* to *a*. The sequence *eh₂* becomes a long *ā* in most daughter languages.\n    *   *g: Voiced velar stop.\n*   **Word Formation:** The verb for 'to seek' in the Germanic languages is a causative/iterative formation, meaning 'to cause to track'. This is typically formed from the \"o-grade\" of the root (*sog-*) with the suffix *-éye-. The form given in the prompt, *seh₂g-ie-ti*, is an e-grade present. We will trace the causative form as it is the direct ancestor of the words for 'to seek' in the target languages. The causative PIE form is **\\*sog-éye-ti**.\n\n**2. Derivation into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\nThe derivation from PIE *sog-éye-ti to Proto-Germanic involves several key sound laws.\n*   **Vowel Change:** The PIE o-grade root *sog- has its vowel lengthened before the suffix, resulting in Pre-Germanic *sōg-. (This is a regular development for o-grade causatives).\n*   **Grimm's Law:** This law describes a systematic shift of PIE stop consonants in Proto-Germanic. For our root, the relevant change is:\n    *   PIE voiced stop *g → PGmc voiceless stop *k.\n    *   Therefore, *sōg- becomes **\\*sōk-**.\n*   **Suffix Development:** The PIE causative suffix *-éye-* becomes the Proto-Germanic Class 1 weak verb suffix **\\*-ija-**.\n*   **Combining Root and Suffix:** Combining the root *sōk-* with the suffix *-ija-* and the standard infinitive ending *-ananą* gives the Proto-Germanic verb.\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **\\*sōkijaną** ('to seek').\n\n**3. Derivation into Daughter Languages**\n\n**A. Old Norse (ON)**\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc *sōkijaną*\n*   **i-Umlaut:** The high front vowel /i/ (or the semivowel /j/) in the suffix *-ijaną* causes the preceding back vowel *ō* (/oː/) to be fronted.\n    *   *ō* → *œ* (/øː/)\n    *   This transforms *sōkija-* into *sœkja-*.\n*   **Syncope:** The unstressed medial vowel *i* is lost.\n*   **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* becomes *-a* in Old Norse.\n*   **Old Norse Result:** **\\*sœkja** (often spelled *sækja*).\n\n**B. Old English (OE)**\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc *sōkijaną*\n*   **i-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the /i/ or /j/ in the suffix (which becomes *-ian* in OE) fronts the root vowel *ō*. In the West Germanic dialects that became Old English, the result of i-umlaut on *ō* is *ē*.\n    *   *ō* → *ē* (/eː/)\n    *   This transforms *sōkian* into *sēkian*.\n*   **Palatalization:** In Old English, the velar consonant *k* was palatalized to the affricate /tʃ/ (written as *ċ*) when it came before a front vowel like the *i* or *e* that resulted from i-umlaut.\n    *   *k* → *ċ* (/tʃ/)\n    *   This transforms *sēkian* into *sēċan*.\n*   **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc ending *-aną* becomes *-an* in Old English.\n*   **Old English Result:** **\\*sēċan** (or *sēcan*).\n\n**C. Old High German (OHG)**\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc *sōkijaną*\n*   **Old High German Diphthongization:** Proto-Germanic long vowels *ē* and *ō* were diphthongized in Old High German.\n    *   *ō* → *uo*\n    *   This transforms *sōk(i)an* into *suok(i)an*.\n*   **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This shift affected voiceless stops that were not preceded by a fricative. After a vowel, *k* became a voiceless velar fricative /x/, written as *hh*.\n    *   *k* → *hh* (/x/)\n    *   This transforms *suok(i)an* into *suohh(i)an*.\n*   **Suffix Change:** The medial *i* of the suffix was generally lost, and the infinitive ending became *-an*.\n*   **Old High German Result:** **\\*suohhen**.\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkijaną\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkja\n*   **Old English:** *sēċan\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhen*\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: *sœkja (or *sækja*); Old English: *sēċan (or *sēcan*); Old High German: *suohhen>>>"
