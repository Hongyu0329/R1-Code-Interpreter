The appropriate management involves a multi-phase approach starting with immediate medical referral to control her diabetes (HbA1c of 7.5%). Emergency dental care includes wound debridement, radiographs to rule out fractures, and antibiotic/analgesic prescription. The 28-hour delay makes replantation impossible. The cells of interest are primarily those involved in wound healing (platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts) and bone remodeling (osteoblasts, osteoclasts), whose function is compromised by her uncontrolled diabetes. Systemically, pancreatic beta-cells are of interest.
Given her medical condition, skeletal Class III profile (SNB 88‚Å∞), and long edentulous span, the most appropriate definitive replacement is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture** made of a **Cobalt-Chromium alloy framework with acrylic teeth and base**.
The **abutment teeth** would be:
1.  **Left Second Premolar** and **Left Central Incisor** as primary abutments adjacent to the space.
2.  **Right Canine** and **Right First Premolar** as indirect retainers.
**Reasoning:** This selection of abutments creates a stable tripod design. The primary abutments support the prosthesis, while the contralateral abutments (indirect retainers) are crucial to counteract rotational forces and prevent the denture from dislodging during function, ensuring stability for the long span.
