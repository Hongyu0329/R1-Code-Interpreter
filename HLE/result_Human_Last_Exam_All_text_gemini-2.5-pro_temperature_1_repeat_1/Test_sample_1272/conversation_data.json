    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Event:**\n    *   **General:** Mu Sheng (沐晟), a high-ranking general of the Ming Dynasty.\n    *   **Event:** His first major defeat in Vietnam. This occurred during the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), led by the future emperor Lê Lợi, which sought to end the Ming occupation of Vietnam.\n\n2.  **Research Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam:**\n    *   Mu Sheng was involved in the initial Ming invasion (1406-1407) and later returned in 1427 to lead a major reinforcement army to save the besieged Ming forces in Đông Quan (modern-day Hanoi).\n    *   The question refers to a \"major defeat,\" which points to the decisive final phase of the war in 1427. While the Ming forces had faced setbacks before, the 1427 campaigns were catastrophic for them.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the Specific Battle:**\n    *   In late 1427, two large Ming armies were sent to crush the Vietnamese resistance. One was led by Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng) from Guangxi, and the other was led by Mu Sheng from Yunnan.\n    *   Mu Sheng's army advanced into Vietnam via the Lam River valley. The Vietnamese forces, commanded by generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, were tasked with stopping him.\n    *   The decisive engagement where Mu Sheng's army was defeated was the **Battle of Khả Lưu Pass** (Ải Khả Lưu). The Vietnamese forces set up a series of ambushes at Khả Lưu and Lãnh Câu.\n    *   In this battle, the Ming army was routed, suffering thousands of casualties. This defeat was a significant blow that shattered the morale of Mu Sheng's army and forced him to halt his advance and eventually retreat back to Yunnan. This qualifies as his first major, personal defeat during this critical campaign.\n\n4.  **Locate the Battlefield in Modern Geography:**\n    *   Historical records, including the *Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư*, place the Khả Lưu Pass and Lãnh Câu in the upper reaches of the Lam River (Sông Lam).\n    *   This strategic location was on the main route for armies entering from Yunnan (in the west) into the heartland of Vietnam.\n    *   At the time, this entire region was part of the historical territory of Nghệ An.\n    *   Mapping this historical location to modern administrative divisions shows that the battlefield lies within the mountainous western region of what is today **Nghệ An Province**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing from other battles:** It's important not to confuse this with the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang, which happened around the same time but involved the *other* Ming army led by Liu Sheng. Liu Sheng was killed, and his army was completely annihilated. While more famous, this was not Mu Sheng's defeat.\n*   **Defining \"Major Defeat\":** Mu Sheng's forces had faced resistance before, but the Battle of Khả Lưu was a large-scale, decisive battle where the army under his direct command was routed, leading to the failure of his entire mission.\n*   **Historical vs. Modern Geography:** The historical Nghệ An region was larger than the modern province. However, the specific location of Khả Lưu Pass is firmly within the boundaries of the present-day Nghệ An Province.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred at the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass in 1427. This historical site is located in the modern-day territory of Nghệ An Province.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
