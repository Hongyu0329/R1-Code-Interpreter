    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Mathematical Objects**\nThe question is about the algebraic $K$-theory of the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27$. We are interested in the groups $K_{2n}(R)$ for a natural number $n$. We need to find the largest $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is a non-zero group.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Ring and its K-groups**\nThe ring is $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$. This is a ring of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ where $p=3$ is an odd prime and $k=3$.\nA fundamental result in algebraic K-theory (due to Soul√©, Weibel, and others) states that for a prime $p$ and integer $k \\ge 1$, the K-groups $K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ for $i \\ge 1$ are finite $p$-groups.\nTherefore, for any $n \\ge 1$, the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is a finite 3-group. This means its order is a power of 3.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the Modern Computations of K-theory for $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$**\nThe computation of the algebraic K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ is a deep result in modern mathematics, achieved through the use of Topological Cyclic Homology (TC). A key theorem by McCarthy, Hesselholt, and Madsen states that for a ring like $R = \\mathbb{Z}/p^k$, the $p$-completion of its K-groups are isomorphic to its TC-groups.\nSpecifically, for $i \\ge 1$, there is an isomorphism:\n$K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)_{(p)} \\cong TC_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; p)$\nSince we established in Step 2 that $K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is a $p$-group for $i \\ge 1$, its $p$-completion is the group itself. So, for $i \\ge 1$:\n$K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k) \\cong TC_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; p)$\n\n**Step 4: Use the Explicit Computation of TC-groups**\nThe groups $TC_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; p)$ were computed by Lars Hesselholt. The result depends on whether the prime $p$ is odd or even.\nFor an odd prime $p$, the computation yields:\n*   $TC_{2j-1}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; p) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p^k \\oplus \\bigoplus_{m \\ge 1} \\mathbb{Z}/p^{\\min(k, \\nu_p(m)+1)}$ for $j \\ge 1$. (These are the odd K-groups).\n*   $TC_{2j}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; p) = 0$ for $j \\ge 1$. (These are the even K-groups).\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Result to the Specific Problem**\nWe are interested in $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ where $p=3$ is an odd prime. According to the results from Step 3 and 4, for any natural number $n \\ge 1$:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong TC_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27; 3) = 0$.\nThis means that for all positive natural numbers $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$, the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is the trivial group.\n\n**Step 6: Consider the Case n=0**\nThe question asks for the largest natural number $n$. The fact that all positive $n$ yield a zero group suggests that the question might be interpreted with \"natural numbers\" including 0 (i.e., $\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$), as is common in many areas of mathematics like set theory and computer science. Let's check the case $n=0$.\nWe need to compute the group $K_{2 \\times 0}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_0(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$.\n\n$K_0(R)$ is the Grothendieck group of finitely generated projective modules over the ring $R$.\nThe ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27$ is a local ring because it has a unique maximal ideal, which is $(3)/ (27)$.\nA standard theorem in module theory states that any finitely generated projective module over a local ring is free.\nThe isomorphism classes of finitely generated free modules over $R$ are determined by their rank, which is a non-negative integer. The direct sum of modules corresponds to the addition of their ranks.\nThus, the semigroup of isomorphism classes of f.g. projective modules is isomorphic to $(\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}, +)$.\nThe Grothendieck group of this semigroup is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $K_0(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nWe have found that:\n*   For $n \\ge 1$, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = 0$.\n*   For $n=0$, $K_0(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which is a non-zero group.\n\nThe set of natural numbers $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero is $\\{0\\}$.\nThe largest element in this set is 0."
