    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Triple Crown\nFirst, it's crucial to understand what the \"Triple Crown\" in baseball refers to. While there is a pitching Triple Crown, the term most commonly refers to the **batting Triple Crown**. A player achieves this feat by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Question's Nuance\nThe question \"How many triple crowns winners are there?\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n*   How many *times* has the Triple Crown been won?\n*   How many *unique players* have won the Triple Crown?\n\nTypically, \"how many winners\" refers to the number of unique individuals. We will count the number of unique players but will also note the total number of times the feat has been accomplished, as some players have won it more than once.\n\n### Step 3: List the Triple Crown Winners by League\nWe need to compile a list of all players who have won the batting Triple Crown in either the American League (AL) or the National League (NL).\n\n**American League (AL) Triple Crown Winners:**\n1.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n2.  **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n3.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n4.  **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n5.  **Ted Williams** (1942)\n6.  **Ted Williams** (1947) - *This is his second win.*\n7.  **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n8.  **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n9.  **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n10. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** In the AL, the Triple Crown has been won 10 times by 9 different players. Ted Williams is the only AL player to win it twice.\n\n**National League (NL) Triple Crown Winners:**\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887) - *Note: Won in the American Association, which MLB recognizes as a major league for this era.*\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n4.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n5.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922)\n6.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1925) - *This is his second win.*\n7.  **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n8.  **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n\n*   **Careful Point:** In the NL, the Triple Crown has been won 8 times by 7 different players. Rogers Hornsby is the only NL player to win it twice.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Unique Winners\nTo find the total number of unique winners, we count each player from both lists only once.\n\n*   **Unique AL Winners:** Nap Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, Miguel Cabrera.\n    *   Total = 9 players.\n*   **Unique NL Winners:** Paul Hines, Tip O'Neill, Hugh Duffy, Heinie Zimmerman, Rogers Hornsby, Chuck Klein, Joe Medwick.\n    *   Total = 7 players.\n\nAdding the unique players from both leagues gives us the final count:\n9 (from AL) + 7 (from NL) = **16** unique players.\n\n### Summary\n*   The batting Triple Crown has been won **18 times** in MLB history.\n*   Two players have won it twice: Ted Williams and Rogers Hornsby.\n*   Therefore, there have been **16 different players** who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<16>>>"
