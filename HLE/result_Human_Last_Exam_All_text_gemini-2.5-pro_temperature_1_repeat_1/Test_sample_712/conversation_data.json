    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms\n\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific **genus of bacterium**. This bacterium must **produce a chemical compound**. This compound, in turn, must exhibit a specific physical property: **triboluminescence**.\n\n*   **Genus:** A taxonomic rank in biology, above species and below family. We are looking for a group name like *Escherichia* or *Bacillus*.\n*   **Triboluminescence:** This is a crucial term. It is an optical phenomenon in which light is generated when a material is mechanically pulled apart, ripped, scratched, crushed, or rubbed. The name comes from the Greek \"tribo-\" (τρίβω), meaning \"to rub,\" and the Latin \"lumen,\" meaning \"light.\" It is fundamentally different from bioluminescence, which is light produced by a chemical reaction within a living organism (e.g., fireflies). Triboluminescence is light from mechanical stress on a crystal structure.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Link between Bacteria and Triboluminescence\n\nThe question implies that there is a bacterium that naturally synthesizes a compound which, when crystallized and subjected to mechanical stress, will produce light. This is a rare phenomenon. We must search for documented examples in scientific literature.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing Triboluminescence from Bioluminescence.** Many bacteria are famous for being *bioluminescent* (e.g., *Vibrio fischeri*, *Photobacterium phosphoreum*). They glow continuously due to the luciferase-luciferin reaction. This is *not* triboluminescence. The key is that triboluminescence requires mechanical action on a solid (usually crystalline) form of the substance.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Specific Bacterium and Compound\n\nResearch into this specific phenomenon points to the work of early-20th-century biologist E. Newton Harvey, a pioneer in the study of luminescence.\n\n*   Harvey discovered that if he took a culture of a specific bioluminescent marine bacterium, dried it rapidly, and ground the resulting powder in a mortar and pestle, it would produce flashes of light.\n*   The bacterium he was working with was from the genus **Photobacterium**, specifically the species *Photobacterium phosphoreum*.\n*   The \"chemical compound\" is not a simple molecule like in wintergreen candies (methyl salicylate). Instead, it is the **bacterial luciferase system** itself. When the bacterial cells are dried, the components of their light-producing system—the enzyme luciferase and the substrate luciferin—form a solid, crystalline-like complex.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Mechanism.** When this dried material is crushed, the mechanical energy breaks the crystal-like structures. This breakage triggers the bioluminescent chemical reaction by bringing the enzyme and substrate into contact in the presence of oxygen, resulting in a flash of light. Although the light comes from a chemical reaction, it is initiated by mechanical force, so it is classified and widely cited as a classic example of triboluminescence in a biological system.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Final Answer\n\n1.  The property in question is triboluminescence: light from mechanical stress.\n2.  While many bacteria are bioluminescent (steady glow), very few are associated with triboluminescence.\n3.  The primary example is a bioluminescent marine bacterium.\n4.  When this bacterium is dried, its light-producing enzyme system (luciferase/luciferin) forms a solid material.\n5.  Crushing this dried material causes it to flash, an effect identified as triboluminescence.\n6.  The genus of this bacterium is **Photobacterium**.\n\n<<<Photobacterium>>>"
