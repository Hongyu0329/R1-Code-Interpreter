    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut performance of the Death of Nikiya scene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n    *   **Scene:** The Death of Nikiya (Act II). This is the scene where Nikiya dances with a basket of flowers, is bitten by a snake hidden within, and subsequently dies.\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova.\n    *   **Performance:** Her debut in the role of Nikiya.\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet.\n    *   **Year:** 2009.\n    *   **Step to Count:** *Entrelacé* (also known as *jeté entrelacé* or *tour jeté*). This is a turning jump where the dancer throws one leg up, jumps while turning 180 degrees in the air, and lands on the leg that was thrown up, with the other leg extended behind in an arabesque.\n\n2.  **Locate the Specific Variation:**\n    The entrelacés occur in Nikiya's solo variation with the flower basket. The specific sequence is a famous diagonal of jumps that expresses her initial joy, believing the flowers are from her beloved Solor.\n\n3.  **Find and Analyze the Performance:**\n    To answer the question, we need to find a video of the specific performance: Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. This performance is well-documented and widely available on video platforms. Upon viewing the performance, we can focus on the \"flower basket\" variation.\n\n4.  **Count the Steps:**\n    Watching the video of the variation, we can observe the diagonal sequence of jumps. We must count each individual *entrelacé*.\n    *   Osipova begins the diagonal, which travels from one corner of the stage to the other.\n    *   She executes the first *entrelacé*.\n    *   She executes the second *entrelacé*.\n    *   She executes the third *entrelacé*.\n    *   She executes the fourth *entrelacé*.\n    *   She executes the fifth *entrelacé*.\n    *   She executes the sixth *entrelacé*.\n    *   She executes the seventh *entrelacé*.\n    After the seventh jump, the sequence ends, and she moves into the next part of the choreography.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Identification of the Step:** It is crucial to correctly identify the *entrelacé* and not confuse it with other turning jumps or *grands jetés*. The key is the mid-air switch of the legs combined with the 180-degree turn.\n2.  **Correct Performance:** The number of repetitions of a step can vary between dancers or even between performances by the same dancer. The question is specifically about Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut, which must be the reference point. Standard choreography often dictates a certain number, but virtuoso dancers may add or subtract repetitions.\n3.  **Accurate Counting:** The speed and power of Osipova's dancing can make counting difficult. It's important to watch the sequence carefully, potentially multiple times or in slow motion, to ensure an accurate count.\n4.  **Scene Context:** The question specifies the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene, not the \"Kingdom of the Shades\" scene, where Nikiya also has famous solos. The entrelacés are characteristic of the flower basket variation in the Death scene.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis of the video footage from Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi Ballet debut as Nikiya, she performs a total of seven consecutive entrelacés during the diagonal sequence in the \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\n<<<7>>>"
