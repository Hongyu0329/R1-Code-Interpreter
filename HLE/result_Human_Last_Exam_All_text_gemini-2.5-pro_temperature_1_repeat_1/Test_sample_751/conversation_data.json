    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality and find the new output matrix C.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle**\n\nThe principle of duality in linear systems states that the problem of designing an observer for a system defined by the pair (A, C) is dual to the problem of designing a state-feedback controller for a system defined by the pair (A<sup>T</sup>, C<sup>T</sup>).\n\nTo find the observer canonical form (A<sub>o</sub>, C<sub>o</sub>) for the original system, we can follow these steps:\n1.  Define the dual system with matrices A<sub>d</sub> = A<sup>T</sup> and B<sub>d</sub> = C<sup>T</sup>.\n2.  Find the controllable canonical form (A<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>c</sub>) for this dual system.\n3.  The observer canonical form matrices are then given by the transposes of the controllable canonical form matrices:\n    *   A<sub>o</sub> = A<sub>c</sub><sup>T</sup>\n    *   C<sub>o</sub> = B<sub>c</sub><sup>T</sup>\n\nThe question asks for the new matrix C, which is C<sub>o</sub>.\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Dual System**\n\nThe original system matrices are:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe dual system matrices (A<sub>d</sub>, B<sub>d</sub>) are:\nA<sub>d</sub> = A<sup>T</sup> = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB<sub>d</sub> = C<sup>T</sup> = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\nThe dual system is a controller design problem with 2 inputs. Let the columns of B<sub>d</sub> be b<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>2</sub>:\nb<sub>1</sub> = [0, 1, 0]<sup>T</sup>\nb<sub>2</sub> = [1, 1, 0]<sup>T</sup>\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Controllability Indices of the Dual System**\n\nTo find the controllable canonical form, we first need the controllability indices (μ<sub>1</sub>, μ<sub>2</sub>). We construct the controllability matrix W<sub>c</sub> for the dual system:\nW<sub>c</sub> = [b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>d</sub>b<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>d</sub>b<sub>2</sub>, ...]\n\nFirst, compute A<sub>d</sub>b<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>d</sub>b<sub>2</sub>:\nA<sub>d</sub>b<sub>1</sub> = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]<sup>T</sup> = [2, 1, 1]<sup>T</sup>\nA<sub>d</sub>b<sub>2</sub> = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]<sup>T</sup> = [3, 2, 1]<sup>T</sup>\n\nNow, we select n=3 linearly independent columns from W<sub>c</sub>, starting from the left:\n1.  **v<sub>1</sub> = b<sub>1</sub> = [0, 1, 0]<sup>T</sup>**: This is a non-zero vector, so it's independent.\n2.  **v<sub>2</sub> = b<sub>2</sub> = [1, 1, 0]<sup>T</sup>**: This is not a multiple of v<sub>1</sub>, so it's independent.\n3.  **v<sub>3</sub> = A<sub>d</sub>b<sub>1</sub> = [2, 1, 1]<sup>T</sup>**: We check if this is a linear combination of v<sub>1</sub> and v<sub>2</sub>.\n    c<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub> = v<sub>3</sub> => c<sub>1</sub>[0,1,0]<sup>T</sup> + c<sub>2</sub>[1,1,0]<sup>T</sup> = [2,1,1]<sup>T</sup>. The third component on the left is 0, while on the right it's 1. This is impossible, so v<sub>3</sub> is linearly independent of {v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>}.\n\nWe have found n=3 linearly independent vectors: {b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>d</sub>b<sub>1</sub>}.\nTo find the controllability indices, we count how many vectors were taken from each input's chain:\n*   From the chain starting with b<sub>1</sub>: We took {b<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>d</sub>b<sub>1</sub>}. That's 2 vectors. So, μ<sub>1</sub> = 2.\n*   From the chain starting with b<sub>2</sub>: We took {b<sub>2</sub>}. That's 1 vector. So, μ<sub>2</sub> = 1.\n\nThe controllability indices are (2, 1). (Note: μ<sub>1</sub> + μ<sub>2</sub> = 2 + 1 = 3 = n, as required).\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Canonical Matrix B<sub>c</sub>**\n\nFor a multi-input system with controllability indices (μ<sub>1</sub>, μ<sub>2</sub>, ...), the controllable canonical matrix B<sub>c</sub> (in Luenberger form) has a specific sparse structure. Its non-zero rows occur at indices given by the cumulative sum of the controllability indices.\n*   Index for first non-zero row block: σ<sub>1</sub> = μ<sub>1</sub> = 2\n*   Index for second non-zero row block: σ<sub>2</sub> = μ<sub>1</sub> + μ<sub>2</sub> = 3\n\nThe rows of B<sub>c</sub> at these indices (row 2 and row 3) form an identity matrix. All other rows are zero.\nB<sub>c</sub> = [[0, 0],\n       [1, 0],  <-- Row σ<sub>1</sub> = 2\n       [0, 1]]  <-- Row σ<sub>2</sub> = 3\n\n### **Step 5: Find the New Output Matrix C<sub>o</sub>**\n\nUsing the duality relationship C<sub>o</sub> = B<sub>c</sub><sup>T</sup>, we can find the output matrix for the observer canonical form.\n\nC<sub>o</sub> = B<sub>c</sub><sup>T</sup> = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]<sup>T</sup>\nC<sub>o</sub> = [[0, 1, 0],\n       [0, 0, 1]]\n\nThis is the new output matrix for the system in observer canonical form."
