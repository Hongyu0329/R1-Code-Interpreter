    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\nThe question asks to evaluate the definite integral V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\nThis integral is in the form ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx.\nThe antiderivative of f'(x)/f(x) is ln|f(x)|.\nTherefore, using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral is:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n**Step 2: Determine the function F₃(x)**\nWe are given a sequence of function definitions:\n1.  F₀(x) = x\n2.  F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n3.  F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n4.  F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate F₃(x) at the limits of integration, x=0 and x=1**\n\n*   **Evaluate F₃(0):**\n    Substitute x = 0 into the expression for F₃(x):\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\n    Since sin(0) = 0 and e⁰ = 1, we have:\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **Evaluate F₃(1):**\n    Substitute x = 1 into the expression for F₃(x):\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    Note that the argument of sin is in radians.\n\n**Step 4: Check the signs of F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\nTo handle the absolute value |.| in the integral result, we need to determine the sign of F₃(0) and F₃(1).\n*   F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693, which is positive. So, |F₃(0)| = F₃(0) = ln(2).\n*   For F₃(1), the angle 1 radian is in the first quadrant (0 < 1 < π/2 ≈ 1.57), so sin(1) is positive.\n    This means e^(sin(1)) > e⁰ = 1.\n    Then, 1 + e^(sin(1)) > 2.\n    Therefore, F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) > ln(2) > 0. It is also positive.\n    So, |F₃(1)| = F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the value of the integral V**\nNow we can substitute the expressions for F₃(1) and F₃(0) back into the formula for V:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we can write:\nV = ln[ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) ]\n\n**Step 6: Numerically evaluate V**\nWe will use a calculator to find the numerical value of V.\n1.  sin(1) ≈ 0.841471\n2.  e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.841471) ≈ 2.319771\n3.  1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.319771 = 3.319771\n4.  ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.319771) ≈ 1.200001\n5.  ln(2) ≈ 0.693147\n6.  V = ln(1.200001) - ln(0.693147) ≈ 0.182322 - (-0.366514) ≈ 0.548836\n    Alternatively, using the combined formula:\n    V = ln[ 1.200001 / 0.693147 ] ≈ ln(1.731234) ≈ 0.548836\n\nSo, V ≈ 0.548836.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final requested value**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548836 = 5488.36\nThe closest integer to 5488.36 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
