    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core subject of the question.**\nThe question asks for two pieces of information about the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*:\n1.  The common name currently used in its native range.\n2.  The year this common name was coined or officially established.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the native range of the genus *Perdita*.**\n*Perdita* is a very large genus of small bees. Research indicates that its native range is exclusively in North and Central America, with the highest diversity found in the arid and desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Therefore, the \"native range\" refers to this region.\n\n**Step 3: Find the currently used common name.**\nTo find the common name, we can consult authoritative entomological resources relevant to North America, such as field guides, university extension websites, and official lists.\n*   Sources like \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" (Wilson & Carril, 2016) and online databases like BugGuide.net refer to bees of the genus *Perdita* by a specific common name.\n*   The most distinctive and widely adopted common name for this genus is \"Fairy bees.\" This name reflects their incredibly small size, as many species are among the smallest bees in the world. Other names like \"sand bees\" or \"dwarf mining bees\" are sometimes used more broadly but \"Fairy bees\" is the most specific and increasingly standard common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n\n**Step 4: Determine when the common name was \"coined\".**\n\"Coining\" a common name can be informal, but for scientific and official purposes, a name is often formally proposed and adopted by a recognized body. In North America, the Entomological Society of America (ESA) maintains the official \"Common Names of Insects and Related Organisms\" list.\n*   A search of the ESA's official list and related publications is required to find a definitive date.\n*   The common name \"fairy bees\" was formally proposed for the genus *Perdita* to the ESA Committee on Insect Common Names.\n*   After a period of review and member commentary, the ESA officially approved and added \"fairy bees\" to its list of common names.\n*   This official adoption occurred in the year **2018**. While the name might have been used colloquially before this, 2018 marks its formal establishment as the recognized common name by the leading entomological authority in the bees' native range.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer in the requested format.**\nThe question asks for the answer in the format \"<name>, <year>\".\n*   Name: Fairy bees\n*   Year: 2018\n*   Combined Answer: Fairy bees, 2018\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 2018>>>"
