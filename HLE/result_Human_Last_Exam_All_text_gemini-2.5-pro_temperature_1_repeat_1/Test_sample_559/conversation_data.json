    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**The System**\nWe are given the system:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe analyze the system in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the first equation:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$.\n    So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the first equation:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the domain $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$ of the system:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d - 3u^2+4u^3 & 4d - 3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ (-3+10)0 - 3(1)^2+4(1)^3 & 4(0) - 3(1)+5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ (-3+10)(-1) - 3(1)^2+4(1)^3 & 4(-1) - 3(1)+5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7-3+4 & -4-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since they have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This point is a degenerate node.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the separatrices**\nSeparatrices are trajectories that divide the phase plane into regions of qualitatively different behavior. They typically correspond to the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. We have a saddle point at $(1, -1)$.\n\nThe eigenvectors of $J(1, -1)$ give the directions of the stable and unstable manifolds at this point.\n*   For $\\lambda_1 = 1$ (unstable manifold): The eigenvector is $v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The manifold leaves the saddle with a slope of $dd/du = -2/1 = -2$.\n*   For $\\lambda_2 = -2$ (stable manifold): The eigenvector is $v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The manifold approaches the saddle vertically.\n\n**Step 4: Find the equation of the separatrix**\nWe look for invariant curves (trajectories) of the form $d=f(u)$. For such a curve to be a trajectory, it must satisfy the relation $\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{df}{du} \\frac{du}{dt}$.\nLet's test if a simple polynomial curve fits the system, particularly one that could be the unstable manifold of the saddle $(1, -1)$. The curve must pass through $(1, -1)$ and have a slope of -2 there.\n\nConsider the curve $d = -u^2$.\n*   This curve passes through $(1, -1)$, since $-1 = -(1)^2$.\n*   The slope of this curve is $dd/du = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2(1)=-2$.\nThis matches the properties of the unstable manifold at the saddle point.\n\nNow, we verify if $d=-u^2$ is an actual trajectory of the system. We substitute $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation and see if it is consistent with the second.\nThe derivative of $d=-u^2$ with respect to $t$ is:\n$d'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\cdot u'(t) = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow we evaluate the right-hand side of the first differential equation with $d=-u^2$:\n$RHS = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$RHS = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$RHS = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince both calculations yield the same result ($-2u^4 + 2u^3$), the curve $d=-u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold (a trajectory) of the system.\nThis curve connects the equilibrium point $(1, -1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$. As it is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$, it is a separatrix. It separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. For instance, in the region $0<u<1$, trajectories starting above this curve are driven towards $d=+\\infty$ as $u \\to 0$, while trajectories starting below it approach the negative $d$-axis.\n\nThe stable manifold of the saddle point, which corresponds to the line $u=1$ for $d<0$, is also a separatrix. However, the question asks for \"the separatrix\" (singular), and the non-linear invariant curve $d=-u^2$ is a significant feature of the system, making it the most likely intended answer.\n\nThe separatrix is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d=-u^2>>>"
