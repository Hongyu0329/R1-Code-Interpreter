    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation:**\nThe given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$. We can write this as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. This is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We can see that the variables are separable, meaning we can group all terms involving $x$ and $dx$ on one side of the equation, and all terms involving $t$ and $dt$ on the other side.\n\n**2. Separate the variables:**\nTo separate the variables, we can divide both sides by $x^2(t)$ and multiply by $dt$.\n**Careful point:** We must consider if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. Substituting into the original equation gives $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is $0=0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8 \\neq 0$, so the solution we are looking for is not the zero solution. Thus, we can safely divide by $x^2(t)$.\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**3. Integrate both sides:**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nThe integral of the left side is:\n$$ \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} $$\nThe integral of the right side is:\n$$ \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t $$\nCombining these results and adding the constant of integration, $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Apply the initial condition to find the constant C:**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0)=-8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution we found.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n**5. Write down the particular solution:**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Solve for x(t) (optional but helpful for clarity):**\nTo get an explicit formula for $x(t)$, we can first multiply the equation by $-1$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nThen, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n\n**7. Find the value of x(1):**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution. It's easiest to use the form from step 5:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow, we simplify the right-hand side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8} $$\nNow, we solve for $x(1)$ by multiplying both sides by $-1$ and then taking the reciprocal.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
