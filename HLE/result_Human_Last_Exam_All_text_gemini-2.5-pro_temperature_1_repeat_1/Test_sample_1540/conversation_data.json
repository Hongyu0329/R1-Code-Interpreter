    "An analysis of the user's request is as follows.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\n1.  **Objective:** The program must compare two strings, `s1` and `s2`, lexicographically.\n2.  **Input:** The program receives two strings on two separate lines. Both strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and are guaranteed to have the same length, which is between 1 and 100 characters.\n3.  **Comparison Rule:** The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means 'a' is treated as equal to 'A', 'b' to 'B', and so on.\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   Print \"-1\" if `s1` is lexicographically less than `s2`.\n    *   Print \"1\" if `s1` is lexicographically greater than `s2`.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n5.  **Core Constraint:** The solution must be the *most memory-efficient* C program possible. The final answer `m` should be the total memory in bytes used for the variables in this optimal solution.\n\n### List of careful points\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitivity:** A direct comparison of characters (e.g., `'a' < 'B'`) will not work correctly. Before comparison, each character from both strings must be converted to a common case (either both lowercase or both uppercase). The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is ideal for this.\n2.  **Memory Efficiency:** This is the most critical constraint. A standard approach of declaring two character arrays (`char s1[101]; char s2[101];`) to store both strings is not the most memory-efficient. We must find a way to minimize memory usage.\n3.  **Input Stream Handling:** The input is provided as a stream (`stdin`). Once the program reads past a part of the input, it cannot go back. To compare the `i`-th character of the first string with the `i`-th character of the second, we must have both available. Since the first string is read completely before the second one, we must store the first string in memory. However, the second string can be read character by character without storing it entirely.\n4.  **Buffer Sizing:** The maximum string length is 100. In C, a string is terminated by a null character (`\\0`). Therefore, any buffer intended to hold the string must be at least of size `100 + 1 = 101`.\n5.  **Variable Memory Calculation:** To calculate `m`, we must sum the sizes of all variables declared in the program. We will use standard C data type sizes, which are `sizeof(char) = 1` byte and `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes on typical competitive programming platforms.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis to acquire the final answer\n\n1.  **Optimal Strategy:** To achieve maximum memory efficiency, we will store only the first string in a buffer. Then, we will read the second string from the input one character at a time and immediately compare it with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n\n2.  **Minimum Required Variables:** To implement this strategy, the following variables are essential:\n    *   A character array to store the first string. The required size is 101.\n        `char s1[101];`\n        *Memory Cost:* `101 * sizeof(char) = 101 * 1 = 101` bytes.\n    *   An index variable to iterate through the stored string `s1`. An `int` is a suitable and common choice.\n        `int i;`\n        *Memory Cost:* `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n    *   A single character variable to temporarily hold each character of the second string as it is read from the input stream.\n        `char c2;`\n        *Memory Cost:* `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n3.  **Implementation Sketch:**\n    *   Read the first string into the `s1` buffer (e.g., using `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`).\n    *   Loop from `i = 0` until `s1[i]` is the null terminator.\n    *   Inside the loop, read one character of the second string into `c2`. A call like `scanf(\" %c\", &c2);` effectively skips any whitespace (like the newline after the first string) and reads the next character.\n    *   Compare `tolower(s1[i])` and `tolower(c2)`.\n    *   If a difference is found, print `-1` or `1` and exit.\n    *   If the loop completes, it means all characters were identical, so print `0`.\n\n4.  **Total Memory Calculation (m):**\n    The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these essential variables.\n    *   m = (memory for `s1` array) + (memory for `i` index) + (memory for `c2` character)\n    *   m = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 1 byte\n    *   m = 106 bytes\n\nThis configuration represents the minimum possible memory footprint for variables, as storing the first string is unavoidable, and the iterator and single-character buffer are necessary for the comparison logic.\n\n<<<106>>>"
