**1) Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 subunit (Physical Binding):**
The primary interaction hotspots on the human beta-1 subunit (CACNB1a, UniProt P54289-1) are the hydrophobic and polar residues that form the binding groove within the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain. The most critical residues are:
*   **Y212 (Tyrosine 212)**
*   **L214 (Leucine 214)**
*   **L217 (Leucine 217)**
*   **W236 (Tryptophan 236)**
*   **I296 (Isoleucine 296)**
*   **V298 (Valine 298)**
*   **L353 (Leucine 353)**

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**
Gating modulation depends on both the core binding and specific modulatory regions.
*   **Primary Hotspots:** The same residues listed above for physical binding (Y212, L214, W236, etc.) are the most fundamental hotspots for modulation, as binding is a prerequisite for any functional effect.
*   **Fine-Tuning Hotspots:** Additional residues, particularly in the variable N-terminus, provide isoform-specific modulation. For the well-studied **beta-1b** isoform (P54289-2), the key fine-tuning hotspots are:
    *   **C3 (Cysteine 3) and C4 (Cysteine 4):** These residues are post-translationally modified by palmitoylation. This lipid anchor is crucial for modulating voltage-dependent inactivation, representing a hotspot specifically for fine-tuning the channel's kinetic properties.
