    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: State the Equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbb{R}^3$) describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. They consist of a momentum equation and the incompressibility constraint. The variables are:\n*   Independent variables: time $t$ and spatial coordinates $\\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$.\n*   Dependent variables: velocity field $\\vec{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and pressure $p$.\n\nThe equations are:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\vec{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\vec{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity, and we have set the constant density $\\rho=1$ for simplicity (it can be absorbed into the pressure term).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Lie Group of Symmetries\n\nA Lie group of symmetries of a system of differential equations is a continuous group of transformations acting on the independent and dependent variables, which has the property that it maps any solution of the system to another solution. The dimension of this group is the number of independent parameters that define the transformations, which is equivalent to the number of linearly independent infinitesimal generators in the corresponding Lie algebra. We are looking for the dimension of this group of point symmetries.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Symmetries from Physical Principles\n\nWe can identify several one-parameter or multi-parameter groups of symmetries based on the physical invariance properties of the equations.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. Therefore, if $(\\vec{u}(t, \\vec{x}), p(t, \\vec{x}))$ is a solution, then so is $(\\vec{u}(t-s, \\vec{x}), p(t-s, \\vec{x}))$ for any constant $s$. This gives a one-parameter group of time translations.\n    *   **Dimension: 1**\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations do not explicitly depend on the spatial coordinates $\\vec{x}$. Thus, the system is invariant under spatial translations $\\vec{x} \\to \\vec{x} - \\vec{a}$ for any constant vector $\\vec{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a three-parameter group.\n    *   **Dimension: 3**\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are isotropic, meaning their form is preserved under rotations of the coordinate system. A rotation is described by a matrix $R \\in SO(3)$. The transformation is $\\vec{x}' = R\\vec{x}$, $\\vec{u}' = R\\vec{u}$, and $p' = p$. The group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$, is a three-parameter group.\n    *   **Dimension: 3**\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change of inertial reference frame. This corresponds to a Galilean transformation: $\\vec{x}' = \\vec{x} - \\vec{v}_0 t$, $t' = t$, $\\vec{u}' = \\vec{u} - \\vec{v}_0$, and $p' = p$. The constant vector $\\vec{v}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ represents the relative velocity of the new frame. This is a three-parameter group.\n    *   **Dimension: 3**\n\n### Step 4: Identify Scaling Symmetries\n\nLet's search for a scaling transformation of the form:\n$t' = \\lambda^a t$, $\\vec{x}' = \\lambda^b \\vec{x}$, $\\vec{u}' = \\lambda^c \\vec{u}$, $p' = \\lambda^d p$\nthat leaves the equations invariant for a parameter $\\lambda$. We substitute these into the momentum equation and require that the scaling factor cancels out from all terms.\n\nThe derivatives transform as: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\lambda^a \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t'}$, $\\nabla = \\lambda^b \\nabla'$.\n\nThe terms in the momentum equation scale as:\n*   $\\frac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t}$: scales as $\\lambda^{c-a}$\n*   $(\\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\vec{u}$: scales as $\\lambda^{2c-b}$\n*   $\\nabla p$: scales as $\\lambda^{d-b}$\n*   $\\nu \\nabla^2 \\vec{u}$: scales as $\\lambda^{c-2b}$\n\nFor invariance, all these scaling exponents must be equal:\n$c-a = 2c-b = d-b = c-2b$\n\nFrom the first and last equality: $c-a = c-2b \\implies a = 2b$.\nFrom the second and last equality: $2c-b = c-2b \\implies c = -b$.\nFrom the third and last equality: $d-b = c-2b \\implies d = c-b = (-b) - b = -2b$.\n\nWe can choose $b=1$ without loss of generality. This gives the exponents:\n$a=2, b=1, c=-1, d=-2$.\n\nThis defines a one-parameter group of scaling transformations. Let's check that it also preserves the incompressibility condition $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u} = 0$. The term $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u}$ scales as $\\lambda^{c-b} = \\lambda^{-1-1} = \\lambda^{-2}$. So if $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u}=0$, then $\\lambda^{-2}(\\nabla' \\cdot \\vec{u}')=0$, which implies $\\nabla' \\cdot \\vec{u}'=0$. The condition is preserved.\n*   **Dimension: 1**\n\n### Step 5: Consider Other Possible Symmetries\n\nThe full set of point symmetries for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to be finite-dimensional. The non-linear advection term $(\\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\vec{u}$ prevents the existence of a larger symmetry group (like the infinite-dimensional group found for the 2D Euler equations). Specifically, the linear part of the Navier-Stokes equation for $\\vec{u}$ is the heat equation, whose symmetry group (the Schr√∂dinger group) is 12-dimensional in 3D. The non-linearity breaks one of these symmetries (the special conformal transformation), leaving the 11 symmetries we have found.\n\nA point of subtlety is the pressure, which is only determined up to an arbitrary function of time, $f(t)$. The transformation $p \\to p + f(t)$ leaves the momentum equation unchanged since $\\nabla(p+f(t)) = \\nabla p$. This represents an infinite-dimensional group of trivial or gauge symmetries. When determining the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries, these are typically factored out, and one considers the maximal *non-trivial* point symmetry group. The analysis of the equivalent vorticity formulation of the equations (which eliminates pressure) confirms the 11-dimensional symmetry group.\n\n### Step 6: Sum the Dimensions\n\nWe sum the dimensions from the identified groups of transformations:\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Space Translations: 3\n*   Spatial Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\nThis 11-dimensional group is sometimes called the Galilean-similitude group."
