    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks to identify the person whose *lectures* were cited by Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the specific paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers from 1905. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n\n3.  **Examine the paper's citations:** A well-known historical fact about Einstein's 1905 papers is that they were remarkable for their lack of citations to previous work. Einstein built his arguments largely from first principles. A direct examination of the Brownian motion paper confirms this: it contains no formal bibliography, footnotes, or in-text citations mentioning the work of other scientists.\n\n4.  **Consider the term \"lectures\":** The question specifically uses the word \"lectures,\" which is a significant clue. This suggests the source might be a published book based on a lecture series, as was common at the time.\n\n5.  **Investigate Einstein's other 1905 work:** In the same year, 1905, Einstein also completed and submitted his doctoral thesis, \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions). This thesis is conceptually very closely linked to the Brownian motion paper; both works use statistical mechanics to provide evidence for the existence of atoms and to determine their size.\n\n6.  **Examine the citations in the thesis:** Unlike the Brownian motion paper, Einstein's doctoral thesis *does* contain a few citations. One of the key sources he cites is a two-volume work by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n7.  **Identify the specific cited work:** The work Einstein cited in his thesis is Ludwig Boltzmann's \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\". The German word **\"Vorlesungen\"** translates directly to **\"Lectures\"**.\n\n8.  **Synthesize and conclude:** Although the 1905 paper on Brownian motion itself contains no citations, the question is likely referring to Einstein's major scientific output from that year as a whole. Given the specific keyword \"lectures\" and the close thematic link between the paper and the thesis, the most accurate answer is Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein cited Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" in his doctoral thesis, which was written and submitted in the same year as the Brownian motion paper.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Precision of the Question:** The question is slightly imprecise. Strictly speaking, the Brownian motion *paper* has no citations. However, the intent of the question is almost certainly pointing towards the citation in the closely related doctoral *thesis* from the same year.\n*   **\"Cite\" vs. \"Influence\":** Einstein was influenced by many scientists (like Maxwell and Hertz), but he did not formally cite them in his 1905 papers. The citation to Boltzmann in the thesis is a formal reference.\n*   **\"Lectures\" as a Key Term:** The word \"lectures\" is the critical piece of information that points specifically to Ludwig Boltzmann's \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\".\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the answer is the physicist whose published lectures were cited in Einstein's 1905 doctoral thesis.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
