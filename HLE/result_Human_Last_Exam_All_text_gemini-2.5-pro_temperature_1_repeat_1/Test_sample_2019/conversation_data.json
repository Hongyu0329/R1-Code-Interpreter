    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Attacks\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid of squares. Let's label the squares by coordinates (r, c), where r (row) and c (column) are integers from 0 to 4.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around. This means row 0 is adjacent to row 4, and column 0 is adjacent to column 4. All arithmetic for coordinates will be done modulo 5.\n*   **Queen's Attack:** A queen at (r, c) attacks any square in:\n    1.  The same row: any (r, c')\n    2.  The same column: any (r', c)\n    3.  The same diagonals.\n*   **Toroidal Diagonals:** On a toroidal board, the diagonals also wrap around. A square (r', c') is on a diagonal with (r, c) if:\n    *   `r' + c' ≡ r + c (mod 5)` (sum-diagonals)\n    *   `r' - c' ≡ r - c (mod 5)` (difference-diagonals)\n\n### Step 2: Defining a Non-Attacking Configuration\n\nWe need to place 4 queens, let's say at positions `(r_1, c_1)`, `(r_2, c_2)`, `(r_3, c_3)`, and `(r_4, c_4)`. For them to be non-attacking, the following four conditions must be met:\n1.  All four row indices `{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4}` must be distinct.\n2.  All four column indices `{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}` must be distinct.\n3.  All four sum-diagonal indices `{(r_1+c_1), (r_2+c_2), (r_3+c_3), (r_4+c_4)}` must be distinct (mod 5).\n4.  All four difference-diagonal indices `{(r_1-c_1), (r_2-c_2), (r_3-c_3), (r_4-c_4)}` must be distinct (mod 5).\n\n### Step 3: Relating the 4-Queen Problem to the 5-Queen Problem\n\nCounting these configurations directly is complex. A more elegant approach is to relate this problem to the simpler, more structured problem of placing 5 non-attacking queens on the same board.\n\nLet's assume we have a valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens.\n*   The set of row indices `R = {r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4}` has 4 distinct values. There is exactly one row, `r_5`, that is not used.\n*   The set of column indices `C = {c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}` has 4 distinct values. There is exactly one column, `c_5`, that is not used.\n*   The set of sum-diagonals `U = {(r_1+c_1), ..., (r_4+c_4)}` (mod 5) has 4 distinct values. There is exactly one sum-diagonal index, `u_5`, that is not used.\n*   The set of diff-diagonals `V = {(r_1-c_1), ..., (r_4-c_4)}` (mod 5) has 4 distinct values. There is exactly one diff-diagonal index, `v_5`, that is not used.\n\nConsider placing a fifth queen at `(r_5, c_5)`. By definition, it is in a unique row and column. Does it satisfy the diagonal constraints? We need to check if `r_5 + c_5 ≡ u_5 (mod 5)` and `r_5 - c_5 ≡ v_5 (mod 5)`.\n\nIn the field of integers modulo 5 (`Z_5`), the sum of all elements is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`.\nFrom this property, we have:\n*   `r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4 + r_5 ≡ 0 \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{4} r_i ≡ -r_5`\n*   `c_1+c_2+c_3+c_4 + c_5 ≡ 0 \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i ≡ -c_5`\n*   `u_1+u_2+u_3+u_4 + u_5 ≡ 0 \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{4} u_i ≡ -u_5`\n*   `v_1+v_2+v_3+v_4 + v_5 ≡ 0 \\implies \\sum_{i=1}^{4} v_i ≡ -v_5`\n\nNow let's check the sum-diagonal for the 5th queen:\n`\\sum u_i = \\sum (r_i+c_i) = (\\sum r_i) + (\\sum c_i)`\nSubstituting the sums:\n`-u_5 ≡ (-r_5) + (-c_5) ≡ -(r_5+c_5)`\n`u_5 ≡ r_5+c_5 (mod 5)`\nThis confirms the 5th queen lies on the required unique sum-diagonal.\n\nSimilarly for the difference-diagonal:\n`\\sum v_i = \\sum (r_i-c_i) = (\\sum r_i) - (\\sum c_i)`\nSubstituting the sums:\n`-v_5 ≡ (-r_5) - (-c_5) ≡ -(r_5-c_5)`\n`v_5 ≡ r_5-c_5 (mod 5)`\nThis confirms the 5th queen lies on the required unique diff-diagonal.\n\n**Careful Point:** This shows that any valid configuration of 4 non-attacking queens can be uniquely completed to a valid configuration of 5 non-attacking queens.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the 5-Queen Solutions\n\nThis simplifies our problem: we can count the number of 5-queen solutions and then determine how many 4-queen solutions they generate.\n\nA 5-queen solution corresponds to a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, where the queens are at `(x, p(x))`. The non-attacking conditions mean that the functions `x \\to p(x)`, `x \\to x+p(x)`, and `x \\to x-p(x)` must all be permutations.\n\nFor a prime-sized board `n x n`, it is a known result that these permutations are precisely the linear permutations of the form `p(x) = ax + b (mod n)` where `a`, `a-1`, and `a+1` are all non-zero (mod n).\n\nFor our 5x5 board, `n=5`:\n*   `a \\not\\equiv 0`\n*   `a - 1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\implies a \\not\\equiv 1`\n*   `a + 1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\implies a \\not\\equiv -1 \\equiv 4`\n\nSo, `a` can be `2` or `3`.\nThe value `b` can be any of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\nThe number of possible values for `a` is 2.\nThe number of possible values for `b` is 5.\nTotal number of 5-queen solutions = `2 * 5 = 10`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Answer\n\nEach of the 10 solutions for 5 queens is a set of 5 points. To get a 4-queen solution, we can simply remove any one of the 5 queens.\nNumber of ways to choose which queen to remove = `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n\nSo, from the 10 distinct 5-queen solutions, we can generate `10 * 5 = 50` potential 4-queen solutions.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must ensure these 50 solutions are all unique. Could removing a queen from solution A yield the same set as removing a queen from solution B? This would only be possible if solution A and solution B shared 4 points. A 5-queen solution is the graph of a line `y=ax+b`. Two distinct lines (`(a,b) != (a',b')`) can intersect at most at one point. Therefore, two distinct 5-queen solutions can share at most one queen. A set of 4 queens can belong to at most one 5-queen solution.\n\nThus, all 50 configurations are distinct.\n\nThe total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is `10 * 5 = 50`.\n\n<<<50>>>"
