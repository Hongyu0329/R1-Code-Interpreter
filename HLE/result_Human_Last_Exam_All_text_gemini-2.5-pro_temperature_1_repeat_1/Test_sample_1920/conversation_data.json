    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We test for small prime factors. It's not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   To factor 7657, we test primes. $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   To factor 589, we test primes. $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   The primes 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all distinct.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor $d$ is a square-free integer.\n\n### Step 2: Character Decomposition and the Primitivity Condition\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$$ \\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31} $$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\nA key theorem states that for a square-free conductor $d$, a character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_p$ is non-trivial. The only trivial character is the one of order 1. Thus, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, the order of each $\\chi_p$ must be greater than 1.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** This simple condition for primitivity is specific to square-free conductors.\n\n### Step 3: The Order Condition\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$$ \\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) $$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n$$ \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6 $$\n\n### Step 4: Properties and Count of Component Characters\nLet $o_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. Therefore, the order of any character $\\chi_p$ must divide $p-1$.\nFrom the lcm condition, $o_p$ must also be a divisor of 6. Thus, for each prime $p$, $o_p$ must be a divisor of $\\gcd(6, p-1)$.\n\nLet's check this for our primes:\n*   For $p=7$: $p-1=6$. $\\gcd(6, 6)=6$.\n*   For $p=13$: $p-1=12$. $\\gcd(6, 12)=6$.\n*   For $p=19$: $p-1=18$. $\\gcd(6, 18)=6$.\n*   For $p=31$: $p-1=30$. $\\gcd(6, 30)=6$.\n\nIn all cases, the order $o_p$ can be any divisor of 6, which are {1, 2, 3, 6}.\nCombining this with the primitivity condition ($o_p > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nNow, we count how many characters exist for each of these possible orders. The number of characters of order $k$ in a cyclic group whose order is a multiple of $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\nThis count is the same for each of the four primes since $p-1$ is a multiple of 6 for all of them.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** We must check that for each prime factor $p$, $p-1$ is a multiple of all the necessary orders. In this case, $p-1$ is a multiple of 6 for all $p$, simplifying the problem significantly.\n\n### Step 5: Combinatorial Counting\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ that satisfy the conditions. For each prime $p$, we choose a character $\\chi_p$ with order $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The lcm of these four orders must be 6.\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$ means that:\n1.  All orders $o_p$ must be divisors of 6 (which we have already established).\n2.  At least one order must be divisible by 2.\n3.  At least one order must be divisible by 3.\n\nWe will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose one character for each prime $p$ with an order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. For each prime, the number of choices is:\nNumber of choices per prime = (chars of order 2) + (chars of order 3) + (chars of order 6)\n$= \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are 4 primes, the total number of tuples of characters where each component has order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis total count includes cases where the lcm is not 6. Since all orders are from $\\{2,3,6\\}$, the lcm can be 2, 3 or 6. We must exclude the cases where the lcm is 2 or 3.\n\n*   **Case A: lcm = 2.**\n    This occurs if and only if all component orders $o_p$ are 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. The number of such tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Case B: lcm = 3.**\n    This occurs if and only if all component orders $o_p$ are 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. The number of such tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of initial possibilities minus the invalid ones.\nNumber of characters = (Total possibilities) - (Number with lcm=2) - (Number with lcm=3)\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The counting method must correctly implement the lcm condition. The inclusion-exclusion approach is robust here. We count all tuples of primitive characters whose orders divide 6, and then subtract the tuples whose orders' lcm is a proper divisor of 6.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Factorization of $d$: Correct.\n2.  Primitivity condition for square-free $d$: Correct.\n3.  Order of product character is lcm: Correct.\n4.  Counting characters of specific order via $\\phi(k)$: Correct.\n5.  Combinatorial calculation: Correct.\n\nThe analysis is sound.\n\n<<<608>>>"
