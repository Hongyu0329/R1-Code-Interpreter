    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Event:** The question asks for the duration of the \"Second Great War\". In StarCraft lore, this conflict is the central narrative of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*), and is also known as the End War.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date:** The Second Great War begins with the renewed Zerg invasion of the Terran Dominion, led by the returned Queen of Blades, Sarah Kerrigan. This marks the beginning of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft timeline, these events start in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date:** The war concludes with the final defeat of the dark god Amon and his forces. This occurs at the end of the *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void\". The official timeline places the conclusion of these events in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:**\n    *   The war begins in the year 2504.\n    *   The war ends in the year 2506.\n    *   This means the conflict took place across parts of three distinct calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Duration and Rounding Rule:**\n    *   The events of *Wings of Liberty* take place in 2504.\n    *   The events of *Heart of the Swarm* take place in 2505.\n    *   The events of *Legacy of the Void* and its epilogue take place in 2506.\n    *   The total time elapsed from the beginning of the war (in 2504) to its end (in 2506) is therefore greater than two full years, but less than three full years. For example, if it started in March 2504 and ended in July 2506, the total duration would be 2 years and 4 months.\n    *   The question requires the answer to be in years and **rounded up**.\n    *   Since the duration is a value greater than 2 years (e.g., 2.x years), rounding this value up to the nearest whole number results in 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Wars:** It's important not to confuse the Second Great War with the first Great War (the Brood War), which took place from 2499 to 2500.\n*   **Defining the War's Scope:** The Second Great War is defined by the overarching conflict of the *StarCraft II* trilogy, from the initial Zerg resurgence to the final defeat of Amon.\n*   **Interpreting \"Rounded Up\":** This is a key instruction. A simple subtraction of years (2506 - 2504 = 2) would be inaccurate because it ignores the portions of the start and end years and the rounding instruction. Any duration over 2.0 years must be rounded up to 3. Since the war spanned parts of three separate years, its duration must be greater than 2 years.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe Second Great War starts in 2504 and ends in 2506. It spans a period greater than two full years. When rounding this duration up to the nearest whole year, the answer is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
