An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` is a triplet `(x, y, z)` that satisfies `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`. The conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of such a point are: 1. The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`. 2. There must exist a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in the product space `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds: `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`.
