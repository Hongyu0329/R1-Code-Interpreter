    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Theory in the Question**\n\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the first chord in the scale and provides a sense of resolution and stability. For example, in the key of A Major, the tonic chord is A Major.\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a major key, this chord is typically a major chord (written as a Roman numeral \"V\"). For example, in the key of A Major, the fifth note is E, and the standard fifth chord (V) is E Major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** The question specifies a *minor* fifth chord. This is an alteration of the standard harmony. Instead of the major V chord, a minor chord is used (written as a lowercase Roman numeral \"v\"). So, in our A Major example, a minor fifth chord would be E minor. This technique is called \"modal interchange\" or \"borrowing,\" as the minor v chord is borrowed from the parallel minor key (in this case, A minor).\n*   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct and immediate change from the first chord to the second.\n*   **Starts with:** The progression must occur at the very beginning of the song.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that begins with the progression **I → v**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nLet's think through the introductions of famous Beatles songs and see if they fit the pattern.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: Starts with a famous, complex opening chord (often debated as a G11sus4 or Fadd9/G), not a simple tonic. This is incorrect.\n*   **\"Help!\"**: The key is A major. The opening vocal harmony moves from A (I) to F#m (vi). This is incorrect.\n*   **\"Let It Be\"**: The key is C major. The intro progression is C (I) → G (V) → Am (vi) → F (IV). It uses the standard major V chord, not the minor v. This is incorrect.\n*   **\"Hey Jude\"**: The key is F major. The intro is F (I) → C (V) → C7 (V7) → F (I). Again, it uses the standard major V chord. This is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on a Specific Candidate**\n\nLet's analyze the song **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n\n*   The song starts with a memorable solo acoustic guitar intro.\n*   The overall tonal center established by the intro and chorus is **F Major**. Therefore, the tonic chord (I) is **F Major**.\n*   The fifth note in the key of F Major is C. The standard fifth chord (V) would be C Major. The *minor* fifth chord (v) would be **C minor**.\n*   Listening to the intro of \"Michelle,\" the first chord played is indeed **F Major**. The guitar then plays a descending line over this chord, and the progression immediately resolves to the second chord, which is **C minor**.\n*   This creates the exact progression described in the question: **F Major (I) → C minor (v)**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe introductory chords of \"Michelle\" perfectly match the criteria. The song starts with a chord jump from the tonic (F Major) to the minor fifth (C minor). This specific harmonic choice is a key part of what gives the song its sophisticated and melancholic French-inspired sound.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
