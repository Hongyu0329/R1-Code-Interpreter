    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\n\nFirst, let's break down the key elements of the query:\n1.  **Film Type:** It must be an Oscar-nominated film.\n2.  **Character's Action:** A character says the specific words \"Thank you\".\n3.  **Setting of the Action:** This occurs while the character is boarding a bus.\n4.  **Consequence of the Action:** This act \"seals his fate,\" implying it leads to a tragic outcome like capture, imprisonment, or death.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination**\n\nMany famous films have pivotal scenes involving linguistic or cultural mistakes, but they don't quite match all the criteria.\n*   ***Inglourious Basterds*** (2009): This film is often recalled for a similar type of scene. A British officer, posing as a German, gives himself away by ordering three drinks using the wrong hand gesture (index, middle, and ring finger instead of thumb, index, and middle). This happens in a tavern, not on a bus, and involves a gesture, not the phrase \"Thank you.\"\n*   ***The Great Escape*** (1963): In this Oscar-nominated film, a character gives himself away at a train station checkpoint by saying \"Goodbye\" in English instead of the German \"Auf Wiedersehen.\" This is close, but the phrase and the vehicle (train, not a bus) are different.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Exact Criteria**\n\nWe need a film that matches *all* the specific points: Oscar-nominated, \"Thank you,\" a bus, and a sealed fate. This points to a very specific scene.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Correct Film and Scene**\n\nThe film that perfectly matches this description is **Midnight Express (1978)**.\n\n*   **Oscar Nomination:** *Midnight Express* was a major critical success. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Adapted Screenplay (Oliver Stone) and Best Original Score.\n*   **The Character and Context:** The protagonist is Billy Hayes, an American imprisoned in Turkey. After years of brutal incarceration, a fellow inmate arranges an escape for him.\n*   **The Scene:** The plan is for Billy to disguise himself as a local and quietly board a bus that will take him across the border to Greece and freedom. He is given money and a new passport.\n*   **The Fateful Moment:** Billy successfully makes it to the bus. As he steps aboard, he is so overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude toward the bus driver (who is in on the escape) that he makes a fatal error. He turns to the driver and says, **\"Thank you\"** in English.\n*   **The Consequence:** The driver, startled by the English phrase and fearing being implicated, immediately alerts a nearby police officer. Billy is instantly recaptured, and his hope for escape is crushed. This single, small mistake of saying \"Thank you\" in his native language directly leads to his continued imprisonment, thus sealing his fate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully analyzing each component of the question—the Oscar nomination, the specific dialogue, the setting, and the consequence—we can definitively identify the film. The scene described occurs in *Midnight Express*.\n\n<<<Midnight Express>>>"
