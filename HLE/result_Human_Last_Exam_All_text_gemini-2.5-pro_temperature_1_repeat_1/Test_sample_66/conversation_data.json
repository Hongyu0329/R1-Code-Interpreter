    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the structure of the Flag of Tonga.**\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. Inside this white canton, there is a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\n**2. Define the Matrix.**\nWe form a matrix `M` by representing an image of the flag. Every red pixel is assigned a value `a`, and every white pixel is assigned a value `b`. The question asks for the *maximal possible rank*, which means we can choose the values of `a` and `b` to achieve the highest rank. We assume the image has a high enough resolution to distinctly represent all features of the flag.\n\n**3. Analyze the Rows of the Matrix.**\nLet's analyze the structure of the rows of the matrix `M`. We can observe that any given row of the matrix will be one of only two possible types.\n\n*   **Type 1 Row (`R_a`):** A row that is entirely red.\n    *   This occurs for any row that passes through the main red field below the canton.\n    *   This also occurs for any row that passes through the horizontal bar of the red cross within the canton.\n    *   Every pixel in such a row is red, so every entry in this type of row is `a`.\n    *   `R_a = (a, a, a, ..., a)`\n\n*   **Type 2 Row (`R_b`):** A row that passes through the white background of the canton but not through the horizontal bar of the cross.\n    *   Such a row crosses the white background of the canton, the vertical bar of the red cross, and the main red field to the right of the canton.\n    *   The entries in this row will be `b` (for the white background parts of the canton) and `a` (for the red vertical bar of the cross and the main red field).\n    *   For example, if the canton occupies the first `N_c` columns, and the vertical bar of the cross occupies columns `j_1` to `j_2`, this row would look like: `(b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`.\n    *   **Crucially, all rows of this type are identical to each other.**\n\n**4. Determine the Rank from the Row Space.**\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of its row space (the vector space spanned by its row vectors). Since the matrix `M` is composed of only two distinct types of rows, `R_a` and `R_b`, its row space is spanned by these two vectors: `RowSpace(M) = span({R_a, R_b})`.\n\nThe dimension of this space can be at most 2. The maximal possible rank is therefore at most 2.\n\n**5. Find the Conditions for Maximal Rank.**\nThe rank will be exactly 2 if and only if the two vectors `R_a` and `R_b` are linearly independent. Let's analyze the conditions on `a` and `b` for this to be true.\n\n*   `R_a` and `R_b` are linearly dependent if one is a scalar multiple of the other. Let's assume neither is the zero vector.\n*   Let's check if `R_b = k * R_a` is possible for some scalar `k`.\n    *   `R_a = (a, a, ..., a)`. A multiple `k * R_a` would be `(ka, ka, ..., ka)`. For this to be equal to `R_b`, all entries of `R_b` must be the same value, `ka`.\n    *   However, `R_b` contains both `a` and `b` as entries. For all its entries to be the same, we must have `a = b`.\n*   **Conclusion:** If `a = b` (and they are not both zero), then `R_a` and `R_b` become the same vector, making them linearly dependent. The rank in this case is 1.\n\nTo achieve the maximal rank, we must choose `a` and `b` such that `R_a` and `R_b` are linearly independent. This occurs when `a ≠ b`.\n\nLet's check a few cases for `a ≠ b`:\n*   **Case A:** Choose `a = 1`, `b = 0`.\n    *   `R_a = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n    *   `R_b` is a vector containing `0`s and `1`s.\n    *   Since `R_b` has mixed entries, it cannot be a scalar multiple of `R_a` (which has uniform entries). Thus, they are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n*   **Case B:** Choose `a = 0`, `b = 1`.\n    *   `R_a = (0, 0, 0, ..., 0)` (the zero vector).\n    *   `R_b` is a vector containing `1`s and `0`s, so it's a non-zero vector.\n    *   The row space is `span({0, R_b})`, which is just `span({R_b})`. The dimension is 1. The rank is 1.\n*   **Case C:** Choose `a = 2`, `b = 1` (`a ≠ b`, both non-zero).\n    *   `R_a = (2, 2, 2, ..., 2)`\n    *   `R_b` is a vector containing `1`s and `2`s.\n    *   Again, `R_b` is not a scalar multiple of `R_a`. They are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion.**\nThe possible ranks for the matrix are 0 (if `a=b=0`), 1 (if `a=b≠0` or if one of `a,b` is zero but not the other in the specific case of `a=0`), and 2. Since the question asks for the maximal possible rank, we look for the highest rank we can achieve by selecting `a` and `b`. By choosing `a` and `b` such that they are distinct and `a ≠ 0` (e.g., `a=1, b=0` or `a=2, b=1`), we achieve a rank of 2. The rank cannot exceed 2 because the entire row space is spanned by only two distinct vectors.\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank of the matrix is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
