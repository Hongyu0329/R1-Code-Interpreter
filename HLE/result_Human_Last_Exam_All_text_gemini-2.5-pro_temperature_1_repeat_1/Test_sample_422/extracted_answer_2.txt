1. **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The requirement that a belief must be justified by something that is also known creates an endless chain of justifications, making it impossible to know anything.
2. **The Problem of Foundational Beliefs:** The JTB model's structure, which separates a belief from its justification, cannot account for self-evident or foundational beliefs that are necessary to stop the infinite regress, as for these beliefs, the justification is not a separate component.
