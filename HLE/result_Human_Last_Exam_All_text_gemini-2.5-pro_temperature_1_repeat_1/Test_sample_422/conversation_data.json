    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question's Premises**\n*   **Definition of Knowledge:** We must use the JTB definition: Knowledge = Justified True Belief (K = JTB).\n*   **Epistemic Constraint:** The only two available epistemic states (states of holding a proposition) are **Knowledge (K)** and **Belief (B)**. There are no other categories like \"opinion,\" \"supposition,\" or \"foundational intuition\" as distinct states.\n*   **Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are scenarios where a person has a justified true belief that fails to be knowledge due to epistemic luck. Our focus must be on other structural or conceptual issues with the JTB theory itself.\n\n**2. Analyze the JTB Formula under the Given Constraint**\nThe formula K = JTB means that for a Belief (B) to be elevated to the status of Knowledge (K), it must meet two conditions: it must be True (T) and it must be Justified (J).\n*   **Belief (B):** One of our two fundamental epistemic states.\n*   **Truth (T):** This is a property of the proposition, not an epistemic state of a person. It relates the belief to the actual state of the world. This component does not conflict with our constraint.\n*   **Justification (J):** This is the crucial component. Justification consists of the reasons or evidence one has for a belief. These reasons are themselves other propositions that the person must hold. According to our constraint, these justifying propositions must be held in one of two ways: as a Belief or as Knowledge.\n\n**3. Careful Point 1: The Nature of the Justifier**\nFor a belief P to be considered Knowledge, it needs a justification, let's call it Q. What is the epistemic status of Q?\n*   If Q is merely a Belief, the justification is weak. \"I know P because I believe Q\" is not a firm foundation for knowledge. For instance, \"I know my team will win because I just believe they are the best\" is not knowledge, it's just wishful thinking. The justification must be stronger than mere belief.\n*   Therefore, for P to count as Knowledge, its justifier Q must also be Knowledge.\n\n**4. Deriving Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification**\nBased on Careful Point 1, we can identify the first major problem.\n*   To know proposition **P1**, one must have a justification **P2** that is also known.\n*   But for **P2** to be known, it must be justified by another proposition, **P3**, which must also be known.\n*   For **P3** to be known, it must be justified by **P4**, which must also be known.\n*   This creates an endless, backward-moving chain of required knowledge (P1 ← P2 ← P3 ← ...). To know any single thing, one would need to already know an infinite number of other things. This seems logically and psychologically impossible for any finite mind. The JTB model, especially with the strict constraint that any justifier must be knowledge, provides no way to end this regress.\n\n**5. Careful Point 2: Stopping the Regress**\nA common philosophical strategy to stop the infinite regress is foundationalism. This view suggests that some beliefs are \"foundational\" or \"properly basic\"—they are justified but not by other beliefs. Examples might include beliefs about one's own immediate sensations (\"I am in pain\") or self-evident logical truths (\"A=A\"). Let's see how the JTB model handles such a belief under our constraint.\n\n**6. Deriving Problem 2: The Problem of Foundational Beliefs**\nLet's take a foundational belief, **F** (e.g., \"I exist\").\n*   According to our constraint, **F** must start as a Belief. To become Knowledge, it needs to be justified.\n*   Since **F** is foundational, its justification cannot come from another belief (as that would restart the regress). Its justification must be internal or self-evident.\n*   The JTB formula (K = J + T + B) presents a structural problem here. It frames Justification (J) as a separate component that is *added* to a Belief (B). This works for beliefs justified by *other* beliefs, but it breaks down for a self-justifying belief.\n*   If a belief **F** is its own justification, then the Justification (J) is the same as the Belief (B). The formula becomes K = B + T + B, which is circular and uninformative. It fails to explain *how* a belief can be justified without reference to another one. The very structure of the JTB definition—separating the belief from its justification—makes it unable to properly account for the foundational beliefs required to stop the infinite regress.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the JTB definition of knowledge and the constraint that the only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, the two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** For any belief to be knowledge, its justification must also be knowledge. This requires that the justifying belief also be justified by something that is known, leading to an infinite and impossible chain of justifications. This makes it impossible for any belief to ever be fully justified.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Foundational Beliefs:** The JTB model fails to account for foundational (or \"properly basic\") beliefs, which are necessary to stop the infinite regress. The model's structure requires a justification (J) to be a distinct component from the belief (B) it supports. For a self-justifying belief (e.g., \"I feel pain\"), the belief and its justification are not separate. The JTB formula becomes circular (Knowledge = Belief + Truth + Belief) and cannot explain how such foundational knowledge is possible.\n\n<<<1. **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The requirement that a belief must be justified by something that is also known creates an endless chain of justifications, making it impossible to know anything.\n2. **The Problem of Foundational Beliefs:** The JTB model's structure, which separates a belief from its justification, cannot account for self-evident or foundational beliefs that are necessary to stop the infinite regress, as for these beliefs, the justification is not a separate component.>>>"
