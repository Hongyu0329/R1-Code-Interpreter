    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and the Goal**\nThe problem is set on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The goal is to place the maximum possible number of bishops on the \"edge squares\" of this board, with the standard chess rule that no bishop can attack another. The final question is to find out how many edge squares are left empty (lacking a bishop).\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\nThe edge squares are those in the first and last rows (rank 1 and 8) and the first and last columns (file 'a' and 'h').\n*   There are 8 squares on the top edge and 8 on the bottom edge.\n*   There are 8 squares on the left edge and 8 on the right edge.\n*   To avoid double-counting the 4 corner squares, the total number of edge squares is (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28.\n*   Alternatively: 8 (rank 1) + 8 (rank 8) + 6 (file 'a' excluding corners) + 6 (file 'h' excluding corners) = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 3: Utilize the Bishop's Color-Bound Nature**\nA key property of bishops is that they always stay on squares of the same color they start on. A bishop on a white square can only attack other squares that are also white. A bishop on a black square can only attack other black squares. This allows us to break the problem into two independent sub-problems:\n1.  Placing the maximum number of bishops on the white edge squares.\n2.  Placing the maximum number of bishops on the black edge squares.\n\nOf the 28 edge squares, exactly half are white and half are black.\n*   Number of white edge squares = 14.\n*   Number of black edge squares = 14.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on the 14 White Edge Squares**\nWe need to find the maximum number of bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares without any two attacking each other. Let's try a placement strategy:\n1.  Place bishops on all the white squares of the first rank. These are **a1, c1, e1, g1**. This gives us **4 bishops**. These four do not attack each other.\n2.  Now, let's see which other white edge squares are attacked by these 4 bishops:\n    *   The bishop on a1 attacks h8.\n    *   The bishop on c1 attacks a3 and h6.\n    *   The bishop on e1 attacks a5 and h4.\n    *   The bishop on g1 attacks a7 and h2.\n3.  The remaining white edge squares that are *not* occupied and *not* attacked are **b8, d8, f8**.\n4.  We can place bishops on these 3 squares. They do not attack each other, nor do they attack the bishops placed in step 1. This adds **3 bishops**.\n5.  The total number of bishops on white squares is 4 + 3 = **7**.\n6.  At this point, all 14 white edge squares are either occupied by one of these 7 bishops or attacked by one of them. Therefore, 7 is the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the white edge squares.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on the 14 Black Edge Squares**\nThe layout of the black edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the white ones. Therefore, the same logic applies, and the maximum number of bishops we can place on the black edge squares is also **7**.\n*   A valid placement would be:\n    1.  Place **4 bishops** on the black squares of the first rank: **b1, d1, f1, h1**.\n    2.  This leaves the black edge squares **c8, e8, g8** un-attacked.\n    3.  Place **3 bishops** on these squares.\n    4.  The total is 4 + 3 = **7** bishops on black squares.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops and Empty Squares**\n*   Maximum bishops on white squares = 7\n*   Maximum bishops on black squares = 7\n*   Since the two sets of bishops are on different colors, they cannot attack each other. So, the total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge of the board is 7 + 7 = **14**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops.\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Number of placed bishops = 14\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total Edge Squares - Number of Placed Bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   The problem is about maximizing placement, not a real game of chess.\n*   The key is to separate the problem by the color of the squares.\n*   The geometry of the board edge is symmetrical for both black and white squares.\n*   The final answer required is the number of empty squares, not the number of bishops placed.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of edge squares is 28. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on them is 14. Therefore, the number of edge squares lacking bishops is 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
