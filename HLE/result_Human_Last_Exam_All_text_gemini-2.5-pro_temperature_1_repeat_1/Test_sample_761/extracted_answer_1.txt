No, homopolynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They differ fundamentally in their repeating monomer unit (nucleotide vs. monosaccharide), the chemical bond linking the monomers (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic bond), and their elemental composition (containing phosphorus and nitrogen, which polysaccharides lack in their basic structure).
