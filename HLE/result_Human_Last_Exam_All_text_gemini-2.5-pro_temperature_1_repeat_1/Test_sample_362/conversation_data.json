    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the reaction type.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Wittig reaction, which converts a carbonyl group (from an aldehyde or ketone) into an alkene (C=C double bond).\n*   **Reactant 1 (Carbonyl Compound):** Pivalaldehyde. The prefix \"pival-\" refers to the pivaloyl group, which contains a tert-butyl group. Pivalaldehyde is therefore 2,2-dimethylpropanal. Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Wittig Reagent):** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is the systematic name for a phosphorus ylide.\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" indicates a PPh₃ group.\n    *   \"ethylidene\" indicates a two-carbon unit attached to the phosphorus.\n    *   \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)...)\" indicates that a 2-chlorophenyl group is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene unit.\n    *   The structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where the chlorine is at the ortho (2-) position on the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the mechanism of the Wittig reaction.**\nThe Wittig reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the ylide's carbanion on the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. The overall transformation replaces the C=O double bond of the aldehyde with the C=P double bond of the ylide, forming a new C=C double bond and the byproduct triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\n*   **Aldehyde Part:** (CH₃)₃C-CH=\n*   **Ylide Part:** =CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)\n\nCombining these two fragments at the double bond gives the backbone of the product alkene:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the product alkene (Z/E isomerism).**\nThe stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the phosphorus ylide.\n*   **Stabilized Ylides:** These have an electron-withdrawing group (like C=O, CN, etc.) attached directly to the ylide carbon (the one double-bonded to phosphorus). They are more stable and tend to form the E (trans) alkene.\n*   **Unstabilized Ylides:** These have electron-donating or neutral groups (like alkyl or simple aryl groups) attached to the ylide carbon. They are more reactive and tend to form the Z (cis) alkene, especially with aldehydes under standard conditions.\n\nIn our case, the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl). The group attached to the ylide carbon is a 2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl group. Since there is no electron-withdrawing group directly attached to the ylide carbon to stabilize the negative charge via resonance, this is considered an **unstabilized ylide**.\n\nReactions of unstabilized ylides with aldehydes are kinetically controlled and proceed through an early transition state that leads preferentially to the **Z-alkene**.\n\n**Step 4: Assign the Z/E configuration and name the final product.**\nThe structure of the product is (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl).\n\n1.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond:** The chain is 5 carbons long (a pentene).\n2.  **Number the chain:** Numbering should start from the end that gives the double bond the lowest possible number.\n    *   Numbering from the tert-butyl end: ...pent-3-ene.\n    *   Numbering from the chlorophenyl end: ...pent-2-ene.\n    *   The correct numbering starts from the phenyl-containing end.\n3.  **Identify and locate the substituents:**\n    *   At carbon-1: a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n    *   At carbon-4: two methyl groups.\n    *   The base name is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n4.  **Determine Z/E configuration based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules:**\n    *   **At Carbon-2 (C-2):** The attached groups are H and a tert-butyl group (—C(CH₃)₃). The tert-butyl group has higher priority.\n    *   **At Carbon-3 (C-3):** The attached groups are H and a 2-chlorobenzyl group (—CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)). The 2-chlorobenzyl group has higher priority.\n    *   The Z-isomer has the high-priority groups (tert-butyl and 2-chlorobenzyl) on the **same side** of the double bond.\n    *   The E-isomer has the high-priority groups on **opposite sides**.\n\nSince the reaction with an unstabilized ylide favors the Z-isomer, the major product is the Z-alkene.\n\n**Final Product:**\nThe structure is the Z-isomer of 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene. The name is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n```\n      C(CH₃)₃        CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n         \\             /\n          C  =  C\n         /             \\\n        H               H\n```\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
