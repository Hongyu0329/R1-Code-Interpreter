Yes, the theory can fail to hold. The addition of a birefringent medium introduces coupling between polarization states. If the original "theory" or method for inverting the system was based on a simplified scalar model (which would be sufficient for a non-depolarizing random medium), it would become invalid. The birefringent element makes the system inherently vectorial, requiring a full Jones matrix characterization for a successful inversion. The simplified scalar theory would no longer hold.
