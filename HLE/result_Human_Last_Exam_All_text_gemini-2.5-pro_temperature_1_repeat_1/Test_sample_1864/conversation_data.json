    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the essential controls needed for your flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Experimental Setup**\n*   **Technique:** Flow Cytometry Sorting. The key goal is to isolate a pure population of live cells. This makes controls that ensure purity and viability paramount.\n*   **Fluorochromes:** You are using five different fluorochromes (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), which constitutes a multi-color experiment.\n*   **Key Reagent:** \"Streptavidin beads\" are mentioned. This most commonly refers to beads used as compensation controls, especially when using biotinylated antibodies in the staining panel.\n\n**2. List the Categories of Essential Controls and Why They Are Needed**\n\nTo ensure accurate and reliable sorting results, several types of controls are considered essential. We will go through them one by one.\n\n*   **Careful Point #1: Unstained Control (for Cells)**\n    *   **What it is:** A sample of your cells that has not been stained with any fluorescent dye.\n    *   **Why it's essential:** This is the most fundamental control. It is used to:\n        1.  Measure the baseline autofluorescence of your cells.\n        2.  Help set the initial voltage settings on the cytometer for each detector.\n        3.  Serve as the reference negative population against which stained populations are compared.\n    *   **Number of controls:** 1\n\n*   **Careful Point #2: Compensation Controls (Single-Stain Controls)**\n    *   **What they are:** Samples that are stained with only one fluorochrome each. Given your mention of \"Streptavidin beads,\" these are the ideal tools for this. You would have one sample of beads stained for each of your five colors.\n    *   **Why they're essential:** When using multiple fluorochromes, the light emitted by one dye can \"spill over\" into the detector for another. This spectral overlap must be mathematically corrected in a process called compensation. To calculate the correct compensation matrix, the software needs to see the spectral signature of each individual dye. Without proper compensation, you cannot trust your data.\n    *   **Number of controls:** You need one single-stain control for each of the five fluorochromes used (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750).\n    *   **Number of controls:** 5\n\n*   **Careful Point #3: Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls**\n    *   **What they are:** An FMO control is a sample stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. You prepare one FMO sample for each color in your panel. For example, the \"PE FMO\" is stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750, but not PE.\n    *   **Why they're essential:** Compensation corrects for spillover, but it doesn't eliminate the \"spreading\" of the data. A bright signal in one channel can increase the spread of the signal in other channels. FMO controls allow you to see the full extent of this spreading and set accurate gates to distinguish between truly positive and negative cells. For a sorting experiment where purity is critical, FMOs are not optional; they are essential for accurate gating.\n    *   **Number of controls:** You need one FMO for each of the five fluorochromes.\n    *   **Number of controls:** 5\n\n*   **Careful Point #4: Viability Control**\n    *   **What it is:** A control to accurately identify and exclude dead cells. A viability dye (which would be one of your 5 fluorochromes or an additional one) is used.\n    *   **Why it's essential:** Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and have altered autofluorescence, making them a major source of false-positive events. In a sorting experiment, you want to collect live, healthy cells. Therefore, excluding dead cells using a viability dye is critical. To set the gate for the viability dye correctly, it is best practice to have a positive controlâ€”a sample of cells that have been intentionally killed (e.g., by heat) and then stained with the dye. This clearly shows where the \"dead\" population is.\n    *   **Number of controls:** 1 (i.e., one tube of heat-killed cells stained with the viability dye).\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nBy summing the essential controls from each category, we get the total number required.\n\n*   Unstained Cell Control: 1\n*   Single-Stain Compensation Controls: 5\n*   Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: 5\n*   Viability Gating Control: 1\n\n**Total Essential Controls = 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12**\n\n<<<12>>>"
