    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence to find a pattern.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\n\n**Step 2: Check for simple arithmetic or geometric progressions.**\n*   **Differences:** 11-2=9, 23-11=12, 51-23=28, 119-51=68. The differences are not constant, so it's not an arithmetic progression.\n*   **Ratios:** 11/2=5.5, 23/11â‰ˆ2.09. The ratios are not constant, so it's not a geometric progression.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a more complex pattern, such as a recursive relationship.**\nLet's test a pattern of the form `a_n = k * a_{n-1} + C_n`, where `k` is a constant and `C_n` is a sequence that may change with each step.\n\n*   Let's try `k=2`:\n    *   From 2 to 11: 2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n    *   From 11 to 23: 2 * 11 + 1 = 23\n    *   From 23 to 51: 2 * 23 + 5 = 51\n    *   From 51 to 119: 2 * 51 + 17 = 119\n    The pattern is `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + C_{n-1}` where the added sequence `C` is {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}. Finding a simple rule for this sequence is difficult.\n\n*   Let's try `k=3`:\n    *   From 2 to 11: 3 * 2 + 5 = 11\n    *   From 11 to 23: 3 * 11 - 10 = 23\n    *   From 23 to 51: 3 * 23 - 18 = 69 - 18 = 51\n    *   From 51 to 119: 3 * 51 - 34 = 153 - 34 = 119\n    This reveals a consistent pattern: the second term is found by `*3 + 5`, and subsequent terms are found by `*3 - C_n`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the auxiliary sequence.**\nThe pattern for the main sequence is `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - D_n` (for n > 2). The sequence of subtracted numbers, let's call it `D`, is {10, 18, 34, ...}. We need to find the next term in this sequence.\n\n*   The sequence `D` is: 10, 18, 34.\n*   Let's find the relationship within this sequence `D`.\n    *   From 10 to 18: 2 * 10 - 2 = 18\n    *   From 18 to 34: 2 * 18 - 2 = 34\n*   The pattern for sequence `D` is `D_n = 2 * D_{n-1} - 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the next term of the auxiliary sequence.**\nUsing the pattern `D_n = 2 * D_{n-1} - 2`, the next term is:\n*   Next term = 2 * 34 - 2 = 68 - 2 = 66.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the missing term in the main sequence.**\nThe next term of the main sequence, `a_6`, will follow the pattern `a_6 = 3 * a_5 - (next term of D)`.\n*   `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`\n*   `a_6 = 357 - 66`\n*   `a_6 = 291`\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
