    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of members in the \"let-7 family\" that have been identified specifically in \"humans\" to date. This requires understanding what constitutes a \"family member\" in the context of microRNAs (miRNAs).\n\n**Step 2: Define the let-7 Family**\nThe let-7 family is a group of highly conserved miRNAs. They were among the first miRNAs to be discovered and play crucial roles in developmental timing, cell proliferation, and tumor suppression. A miRNA family is defined by members that share a similar sequence, particularly in the \"seed region\" (nucleotides 2-8 from the 5' end). This shared seed sequence means they are predicted to regulate a similar set of target genes.\n\n**Step 3: Differentiate Between Genes and Mature miRNAs (Careful Point 1)**\nA critical point of clarification is the distinction between miRNA genes (precursors) and the final, functional mature miRNA molecules.\n*   **Genes (pre-miRNAs):** These are sequences in the DNA that are transcribed into hairpin-loop structures called precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs).\n*   **Mature miRNAs:** These are short (~22 nucleotide) single-stranded RNA molecules that are processed from the pre-miRNA hairpin. These are the active molecules that regulate gene expression.\n\nThe term \"members of a family\" most commonly refers to the number of distinct **mature miRNA sequences**, not the number of genes. It is possible for multiple different genes, located at different places in the genome, to produce the exact same mature miRNA sequence.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Canonical Members of the Human let-7 Family**\nBased on sequence homology and established nomenclature in databases like miRBase (the central repository for miRNA data), the human let-7 family consists of the following distinct mature miRNAs:\n1.  **let-7a**\n2.  **let-7b**\n3.  **let-7c**\n4.  **let-7d**\n5.  **let-7e**\n6.  **let-7f**\n7.  **let-7g**\n8.  **let-7i**\n9.  **miR-98**\n\nThese nine mature miRNAs are highly similar in sequence and are considered the core members of the human let-7 family.\n\n**Step 5: Account for Genes Encoding These Members (Careful Point 2)**\nTo be thorough, we can also count the number of genes that encode these 9 mature miRNAs. In the human genome, some members are encoded by more than one gene.\n*   **let-7a** is encoded by 3 genes (`hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, `hsa-let-7a-3`).\n*   **let-7f** is encoded by 2 genes (`hsa-let-7f-1`, `hsa-let-7f-2`).\n*   The other 7 members (let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98) are each encoded by a single gene.\n\nCounting the genes gives a total of 3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 7 (for the others) = **12 genes**.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Final Answer**\nWhile there are 12 genes, the question \"how many members\" is standardly interpreted as the number of distinct mature functional molecules. Therefore, the number of distinct mature miRNA members in the human let-7 family is the most accurate answer.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThere are **9** distinct mature miRNAs that constitute the let-7 family in humans. These are encoded by a total of 12 genes. The most direct answer to the question is the number of distinct mature members.\n\n<<<9>>>"
