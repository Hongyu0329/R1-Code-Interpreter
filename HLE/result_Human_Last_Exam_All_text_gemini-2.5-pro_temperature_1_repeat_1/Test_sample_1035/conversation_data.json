    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding and Interpreting the Question\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35\".\n\nThis phrasing is ambiguous. Let's break down the possible interpretations:\n1.  The number of vertices in the union of all vertex sets of the graphs in the family, i.e., $|\\bigcup_{i=1}^k V(B_i)|$. Since the graphs must cover all edges of $K_{35}$, all 35 vertices of $K_{35}$ must be included. So this interpretation would lead to a trivial answer of 35.\n2.  The sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family, i.e., $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|$. This is a valid but non-standard optimization problem.\n3.  The number of graphs in the family, i.e., the size of the family, $k$. This is the most common and standard interpretation for problems of this type in graph theory. It's often referred to as the \"bipartite dimension\" or \"bipartite cover number\" of a graph. The unusual phrasing \"number of vertices in a family\" is likely a poor choice of words for \"number of graphs in a family\".\n\nWe will proceed with the third interpretation, as it corresponds to a well-known problem in graph theory. The problem is thus rephrased as:\n\n**What is the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs of \\( K_{35} \\) whose edges together cover all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\)?**\n\n### Step 2: Recalling the Relevant Mathematical Result\n\nThis is a classic problem in extremal graph theory. The result states that the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) is \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the famous Graham-Pollak theorem, which states that the minimum number of **complete bipartite** subgraphs needed to **partition** the edges of \\( K_n \\) is \\( n-1 \\). The key differences are:\n*   **Bipartite vs. Complete Bipartite:** Our problem allows for any bipartite graph, not just complete ones. This is a less restrictive condition.\n*   **Covering vs. Partitioning:** Covering means every edge must be in at least one graph, while partitioning means every edge must be in exactly one graph. For finding the minimum number of graphs, these are equivalent: if you have a covering with $k$ graphs, you can always create a partition with $k$ graphs by removing edges from graphs that are already covered by others earlier in the sequence.\n\nSince our problem is more general (allowing non-complete bipartite graphs), the number of required graphs should be less than or equal to the Graham-Pollak result. Indeed, for \\( n > 2 \\), \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\le n-1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Justification of the Formula \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\)\n\nWe can prove this formula by establishing a lower and an upper bound for $k$.\n\n**Lower Bound Proof:**\nLet the family of $k$ bipartite graphs that covers \\( K_n \\) be \\( \\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k\\} \\). For each graph \\( B_i \\), its vertices can be partitioned into two sets \\( U_i \\) and \\( W_i \\). We can associate a binary vector (or \"code\") of length $k$ with each vertex \\( v \\) of \\( K_n \\). Let this code be \\( c(v) = (c_1(v), c_2(v), \\dots, c_k(v)) \\), where \\( c_i(v) = 0 \\) if \\( v \\in U_i \\) and \\( c_i(v) = 1 \\) if \\( v \\in W_i \\).\n\nNow, consider any two distinct vertices, \\( u \\) and \\( v \\). The edge \\( (u,v) \\) is an edge of \\( K_n \\) and must be covered by at least one graph, say \\( B_i \\). For the edge \\( (u,v) \\) to exist in the bipartite graph \\( B_i \\), its endpoints must be in different partitions. This means one must be in \\( U_i \\) and the other in \\( W_i \\). Therefore, their codes must differ at the $i$-th position, i.e., \\( c_i(u) \\neq c_i(v) \\).\n\nSince this holds for any pair of distinct vertices, it implies that the binary codes for all $n$ vertices must be unique. The number of distinct binary codes of length $k$ is \\( 2^k \\). To assign a unique code to each of the $n$ vertices, we must have \\( 2^k \\ge n \\). Taking the logarithm base 2 gives \\( k \\ge \\log_2 n \\). Since $k$ must be an integer, we have \\( k \\ge \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\n**Upper Bound Proof (by construction):**\nLet \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). This implies that \\( 2^k \\ge n \\). We can assign a unique binary vector of length $k$ to each of the $n$ vertices of \\( K_n \\).\n\nFor each bit position \\( j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\} \\), we define a bipartite graph \\( B_j \\). We partition the vertices of \\( K_n \\) into two sets:\n*   \\( U_j = \\{v \\in V(K_n) \\mid \\text{the } j\\text{-th bit of } v\\text{'s code is } 0\\} \\)\n*   \\( W_j = \\{v \\in V(K_n) \\mid \\text{the } j\\text{-th bit of } v\\text{'s code is } 1\\} \\)\n\nWe let \\( B_j \\) be the **complete** bipartite graph with parts \\( U_j \\) and \\( W_j \\). Now consider any edge \\( (u,v) \\) in \\( K_n \\). Since \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are distinct vertices, their assigned binary codes must be different. This means their codes must differ in at least one bit position, say the $j$-th position. This implies that one vertex is in \\( U_j \\) and the other is in \\( W_j \\). Therefore, the edge \\( (u,v) \\) is included in the bipartite graph \\( B_j \\).\n\nSince every edge of \\( K_n \\) is contained in at least one of the $k$ graphs \\( B_1, \\dots, B_k \\), this family of $k$ bipartite graphs covers \\( K_n \\). This shows that the minimum number is at most \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\nSince the lower bound and the upper bound are equal, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required is exactly \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculation for n = 35\n\nNow we apply the formula for \\( n = 35 \\). We need to calculate \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\n\nWe look at the powers of 2:\n*   \\( 2^1 = 2 \\)\n*   \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n*   \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n*   \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)\n*   \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n*   \\( 2^6 = 64 \\)\n\nWe can see that \\( 32 < 35 \\le 64 \\).\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of this inequality, we get:\n\\( \\log_2(32) < \\log_2(35) \\le \\log_2(64) \\)\n\\( 5 < \\log_2(35) \\le 6 \\)\n\nThe ceiling function, \\( \\lceil x \\rceil \\), gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.\nTherefore, \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 \\).\n\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
