    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the state-space representation of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with matrices:\n*   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem specifies the closed-loop matrix as `A + BF`. This corresponds to a control law `u = +Fx`. The more common convention is `A - BF` (from `u = -Fx`), but we will adhere to the problem's statement.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe eigenvalues of the closed-loop system dictate its characteristic polynomial. For a second-order system with eigenvalues `λ1` and `λ2`, the characteristic polynomial is `p(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`.\n\n*   Desired eigenvalues: `λ1 = -1 + j`, `λ2 = -1 - j`.\n*   Desired characteristic polynomial:\n    `p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n    `p(λ) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)`\n    Using the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2` with `a = λ + 1` and `b = j`:\n    `p(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\n    `p(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n    `p(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**3. Check System Controllability**\n\nThe ability to place the closed-loop eigenvalues arbitrarily depends on the system's controllability. We check this by finding the rank of the controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]`.\n\n*   Calculate `AB`:\n    `AB = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] * [[1, 2], [1, 0]] = [[(-1)(1) + (1)(1), (-1)(2) + (1)(0)], [(1)(1) + (0)(1), (1)(2) + (0)(0)]] = [[0, -2], [1, 2]]`\n*   Construct the controllability matrix `C`:\n    `C = [B, AB] = [[1, 2, 0, -2], [1, 0, 1, 2]]`\n*   The rank of `C` must be equal to the number of states (n=2). We can check the rank by looking for 2 linearly independent columns. Let's just check the determinant of `B`:\n    `det(B) = (1)(0) - (2)(1) = -2`\n*   Since `det(B) ≠ 0`, the matrix `B` has full rank (rank 2). This means the system is controllable.\n\n**Careful Point:** Because the system is controllable and the input matrix `B` is square and invertible, there is an infinite number of solutions for the gain matrix `F`. We can find one specific solution using a direct placement method.\n\n**4. Calculate the Feedback Gain Matrix F**\n\nSince `B` is invertible, we can use a direct method. We want to find `F` such that `A + BF = A_desired`, where `A_desired` is a matrix that has the desired characteristic polynomial `λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n*   **Step 4.1: Choose a desired closed-loop matrix `A_desired`**\n    A common choice is the controller canonical form:\n    `A_desired = [[0, 1], [-c0, -c1]]`\n    where the characteristic polynomial is `λ^2 + c1λ + c0`. Comparing with our desired polynomial `λ^2 + 2λ + 2`, we have `c1 = 2` and `c0 = 2`.\n    So, `A_desired = [[0, 1], [-2, -2]]`.\n\n*   **Step 4.2: Solve for F**\n    The governing equation is `A + BF = A_desired`.\n    Rearranging for `F`:\n    `BF = A_desired - A`\n    `F = B^(-1) * (A_desired - A)`\n\n*   **Step 4.3: Calculate the inverse of B, `B^(-1)`**\n    `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n    `det(B) = -2`\n    `B^(-1) = (1/det(B)) * [[0, -2], [-1, 1]] = (1/-2) * [[0, -2], [-1, 1]] = [[0, 1], [0.5, -0.5]]`\n\n*   **Step 4.4: Calculate `A_desired - A`**\n    `A_desired - A = [[0, 1], [-2, -2]] - [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    `A_desired - A = [[0 - (-1), 1 - 1], [-2 - 1, -2 - 0]] = [[1, 0], [-3, -2]]`\n\n*   **Step 4.5: Calculate F**\n    `F = B^(-1) * (A_desired - A)`\n    `F = [[0, 1], [0.5, -0.5]] * [[1, 0], [-3, -2]]`\n    `F = [[(0)(1) + (1)(-3), (0)(0) + (1)(-2)], [(0.5)(1) + (-0.5)(-3), (0.5)(0) + (-0.5)(-2)]]`\n    `F = [[-3, -2], [0.5 + 1.5, 0 + 1]]`\n    `F = [[-3, -2], [2, 1]]`\n\n**5. Final Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nLet's compute `A + BF` with our calculated `F` and check its eigenvalues.\n*   `BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[-3, -2], [2, 1]] = [[1, 0], [-3, -2]]`\n*   `A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 0], [-3, -2]] = [[0, 1], [-2, -2]]`\nThis is `A_desired`, which by construction has the characteristic polynomial `λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`. The roots of this polynomial are `λ = -1 ± j`, which are the desired eigenvalues. The calculation is correct.\n\n<<<[[-3, -2], [2, 1]]>>>"
