    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each classical ballet step to determine which one has the same ending leg position as the starting position.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe question asks to identify a ballet step from the given options where the configuration of the legs (specifically, which foot is in front in a closed position like fifth) is the same at the end of the move as it was at the beginning.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Answer Choices:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n    *   **Movement:** This is a vertical jump from two feet. The name \"six\" refers to six movements of the legs (three openings and three closings/beats). In the air, the legs beat three times. For example, starting with the right foot front, the sequence of beats is typically back-front-back.\n    *   **Ending Position:** After the three beats, the dancer lands back in fifth position. A key characteristic of an *entrechat six* is that the feet return to their original configuration. So, if the dancer started with the right foot front, they will land with the right foot front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Even-numbered *entrechats* are often confusing. *Entrechat quatre* changes the feet, but *entrechat six* does not. *Entrechat huit* changes the feet, but *entrechat dix* does not. The rule is that if the number of beats (the number in the name divided by two) is odd, the feet change; if the number of beats is even, they do not change. For *entrechat six*, there are 6/2 = 3 beats (an odd number). *Correction*: The more commonly accepted convention is that *entrechats* with a number divisible by 4 (e.g., *quatre*, *huit*) change feet, while those not divisible by 4 (e.g., *deux*/*royale*, *six*) do not. By this standard convention, *entrechat six* does not change feet.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a two-part jump. First, the dancer jumps from fifth position to second position (an \"escape\" or *échappé*), with a beat (*battu*) of the calves as the legs open. Then, the dancer jumps from second position back to fifth.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The word *changé* explicitly means \"changed.\" This indicates that the feet will swap their front/back relationship. If the dancer started with the right foot front, they will land with the left foot front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The name of the step itself tells you the outcome.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air to land on two feet in fifth position. In the most common forms, *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), the feet change position. For example, in *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes to the side and lands in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The final fifth position has the opposite foot in front compared to the start.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While there are less common variations of *assemblé* that do not change feet, the standard step implies a change.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** *Glissade* means \"to glide.\" The dancer glides the back foot out to the side and transfers weight onto it, then closes the other foot to fifth position. The word *derrière* means \"behind,\" specifying that the leg that started in front closes to the back.\n    *   **Ending Position:** If the dancer starts with the right foot front, the right foot will close behind the left foot. The final position will be fifth with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The direction *derrière* or *devant* in a *glissade* indicates a change of feet. A simple *glissade dessus* or *dessous* does not change feet. However, the specific step given is *glissade derrière*, which does.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a complex, decorative jump, similar to a *pas de chat*, where each leg performs a small circular movement (*rond de jambe*) in the air.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In its standard execution, a *gargouillade* results in a change of feet. The leg that performs the second *rond de jambe* typically lands in front of the other.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is an advanced step, but its common execution involves changing the feet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter analyzing all the options, *Entrechat six* is the only step among the choices that, by its standard definition, finishes with the feet in the same position (e.g., right foot front) as they were at the start. All other options (*Échappé battu changé*, *Assemblé*, *Glissade derrière*, *Gargouillade*) involve a change of feet.\n\n<<<A>>>"
