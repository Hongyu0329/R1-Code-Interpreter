    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are asked to find the \"rule activation level\".\n    *   The context is an **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS)**.\n    *   We are given two values:\n        1.  `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This represents the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the *k*-th rule for a given input `x'`.\n        2.  `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This represents the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the original consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` (the \"THEN\" part) of the *k*-th rule.\n    *   We are told to use a **t-norm operation** to combine these values.\n\n2.  **Understand the Fuzzy Inference Process:**\n    In a fuzzy logic system, the evaluation of a rule like `IF antecedent THEN consequent` involves two key steps:\n    1.  **Antecedent Evaluation:** Determine the degree to which the antecedent is true. This gives the \"firing strength\" or \"firing level\". In this problem, this value is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    2.  **Implication (Consequent Activation):** Use the firing strength from the antecedent to modify or \"activate\" the consequent fuzzy set. This step determines the output fuzzy set for that specific rule. This is done by combining the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership function using a fuzzy operator.\n\n3.  **Interpret \"Rule Activation Level\":**\n    The term \"rule activation level\" in this context refers to the result of the implication step. It is the membership value in the *activated* consequent set. It is calculated by applying an operator to the antecedent firing strength and the original consequent membership grade.\n\n4.  **Handle the Complexity of IT3 FS:**\n    *   In a full Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Logic System, both the antecedent firing level (`Phi_k(x′)`) and the consequent membership (`μG_k_j(y_j)`) would be Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets, not simple numbers.\n    *   However, the question simplifies this complex scenario by providing single, crisp numbers (0.7 and 0.9). This is done to test the fundamental principle of fuzzy implication, which remains the same regardless of the complexity of the fuzzy sets involved. The core operation is applied at every level of the fuzzy set structure.\n    *   Therefore, we can treat this as a fundamental fuzzy calculation.\n\n5.  **Apply the T-Norm Operation:**\n    The question specifies using a t-norm. A t-norm is a fuzzy logic operator that models the AND operation. The implication step uses a t-norm to combine the firing strength and the consequent membership.\n    *   `Activated Membership = T(Antecedent Firing Strength, Original Consequent Membership)`\n    *   `Activated Membership = T(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n    The two most common t-norms used in fuzzy systems are:\n    1.  **Minimum (min) T-norm:** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`. This is characteristic of the Mamdani inference method.\n    2.  **Product T-norm:** `T(a, b) = a * b`. This is characteristic of the Larsen inference method.\n\n    Since the specific t-norm is not mentioned, the most standard and widely used choice is the **minimum (min)** operator.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Using the minimum t-norm:\n    *   `Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   `Rule Activation Level = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Simplification:** The problem provides crisp numerical values for components that are complex fuzzy sets in an actual IT3 FLS. This simplification is intentional to focus on the core implication operation.\n*   **Terminology:** \"Rule activation level\" refers to the membership grade of the output after the rule's premise (antecedent) has been applied to its conclusion (consequent). It is not just the firing strength of the antecedent.\n*   **Choice of T-Norm:** While several t-norms exist, the `min` operator is the most common and standard choice for fuzzy implication (Mamdani systems) when not otherwise specified.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe rule activation level is calculated by applying the specified t-norm to the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership grade. Assuming the most common t-norm (minimum):\n*   Antecedent Firing Level (`Phi_k(x′)`): 0.7\n*   Consequent Membership (`μG_k_j(y_j)`): 0.9\n*   T-norm Operation: `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   Result: `0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
