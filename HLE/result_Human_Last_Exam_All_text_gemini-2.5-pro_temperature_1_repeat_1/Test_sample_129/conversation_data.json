    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the rules\n*   **Symbols:** T, F, !, &, |, (, )\n*   **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Goal:** Count expressions that evaluate to True.\n*   **Precedence:** `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest). Parentheses `()` can alter this order.\n*   **Syntax:** We assume standard boolean expression syntax where an expression `E` can be:\n    *   A constant: `T` or `F`\n    *   A negation: `!E`\n    *   A parenthesized expression: `(E)`\n    *   A binary operation: `E & E` or `E | E`\n\n### Step 2: Categorize expressions by their overall structure\nTo count exhaustively without double-counting, we can classify all possible 5-symbol expressions into mutually exclusive groups based on their structure, determined by the last operation to be evaluated. An easier way that leverages the string representation is to classify by the first symbol of the expression string.\n\nAny valid 5-symbol expression must start with `T`, `F`, `!`, or `(`.\n\n**Case 1: Expressions starting with `(`**\nThe structure must be `(A)`, where `A` is a valid expression of length 3. We need to find the number of such expressions where `(A)` evaluates to True, which means `A` must evaluate to True.\nLet's find all valid 3-symbol expressions `A` and check their value.\n*   `v & v` (where `v` is `T` or `F`): `T&T` is True. (1 expression)\n*   `v | v`: `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T` are True. (3 expressions)\n*   `!(!v)`: `!(!T)` is True. (1 expression)\n*   `(v)`: `(T)` is True. (1 expression)\nTotal true expressions of length 3 (`A`) is 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nEnclosing these in parentheses gives 6 true expressions of length 5.\n*Count: 6*\n\n**Case 2: Expressions starting with `!`**\nThese expressions can be of two forms: `!(A)` where `A` is a valid expression of length 4, or expressions where `!` has the highest precedence but isn't the outermost operation for the whole string, like `!v & !v`.\n\n*   **Subcase 2a: Form `!(A)` where `A` is a valid 4-symbol expression.**\n    For `!(A)` to be True, `A` must be False. So we need to count the number of 4-symbol expressions that evaluate to False.\n    We can enumerate all 4-symbol expression types:\n    1.  `!B` where `B` is a True 3-symbol expression. We found 6 such expressions in Step 1. So this gives 6 False expressions. (`!(T&T)`, `!(T|T)`, etc.)\n    2.  `(B)` where `B` is a False 2-symbol expression. `!T` is the only one. So `(!T)` is one such expression.\n    3.  `v bop !v` or `!v bop v` that are False:\n        *   `T&!T`, `F&!T`, `F&!F` (3)\n        *   `!T&T`, `!T&F`, `!F&F` (3)\n        *   `F|!T` (1)\n        *   `!T|F` (1)\n        This gives 3+3+1+1 = 8 False expressions.\n    The total number of False 4-symbol expressions is 6 + 1 + 8 = 15.\n    Applying `!` to each of these 15 False expressions gives 15 True expressions of length 5.\n    *Count for Subcase 2a: 15*\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: Form `!v bop !v`**\n    These expressions start with `!` but are parsed as `(!v) bop (!v)` because `!` has the highest precedence. The outermost operator is `&` or `|`. These are not of the form `!(A)`.\n    *   `!v & !v`: Only `!F & !F` evaluates to True. (1 expression)\n    *   `!v | !v`: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` evaluate to True. (3 expressions)\n    *Count for Subcase 2b: 4*\n\n**Case 3: Expressions starting with `T` or `F`**\nThe structure must be of the form `v bop ...`. To have a length of 5, the only possible structure is `v bop v bop v`.\n*   `v1 & v2 & v3`: This is parsed as `(v1 & v2) & v3`. It is True only if all are True (`T&T&T`). (1 expression)\n*   `v1 | v2 | v3`: This is parsed as `(v1 | v2) | v3`. It is True unless all are False. Out of 8 combinations for (`v1`,`v2`,`v3`), 7 are True. (7 expressions)\n*   `v1 & v2 | v3`: Parsed as `(v1 & v2) | v3`. This is True if `v3` is True (4 combinations), or if `v3` is False and `v1&v2` is True (1 combination: `T&T|F`). Total is 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n*   `v1 | v2 & v3`: Parsed as `v1 | (v2 & v3)`. This is True if `v1` is True (4 combinations), or if `v1` is False and `v2&v3` is True (1 combination: `F|T&T`). Total is 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\nTotal count for expressions starting with `v` is 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18.\n*Count: 18*\n\n### Step 3: Final Tally\nThe categories are mutually exclusive:\n*   Case 1 starts with `(`.\n*   Case 2 starts with `!`.\n*   Case 3 starts with `T` or `F`.\n\nThe total number of true expressions is the sum of the counts from each case.\nTotal = (Case 1) + (Case 2a) + (Case 2b) + (Case 3)\nTotal = 6 + 15 + 4 + 18\nTotal = 43\n\n<<<43>>>"
