    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Source Media:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event within the Episode:** The Junior prom.\n*   **Object in Question:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Subject:** A fictional singer (or musical act).\n*   **Action:** \"Performs\".\n\n**Step 2: Recall or Research the Episode's Plot**\n\"Teen Girl Squad #15\" is centered entirely around the girls attending their Junior Prom. A key plot point involves the entertainment for the event.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Scene with the Performance**\n*   During the prom scene, the character Cheerleader expresses her disappointment with the musical entertainment.\n*   She says, \"Ugh! I can't believe the only band they could get for the prom is a cardboard cutout of some lame-o indie band.\"\n*   The cartoon then cuts to the stage, showing a cardboard cutout of a full band.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Fictional Performer**\n*   The cutout is of a band, not a solo singer. This is a careful point; the question uses \"singer,\" but the visual evidence points to a band. In this context, the name of the band is the correct answer for the \"fictional singer/performer.\"\n*   On the bass drum of the cutout, the name of the band is clearly written in English.\n*   The name on the bass drum is **\"Kaiser\"**.\n*   Below the English name, the Japanese katakana characters 「カイザー」 are written, which transliterate to \"Kaizaa,\" confirming the name.\n*   A speech bubble is taped to the cutout, reading, \"We'd like to play a song about breaking up,\" further establishing them as the performing band.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the visual evidence and dialogue in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the cardboard cutout that \"performs\" at the Junior prom is of the fictional indie band named Kaiser.\n\n<<<Kaiser>>>"
