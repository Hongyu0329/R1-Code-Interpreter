    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We can try to rearrange the terms to find a common factor.\nNotice that the terms with odd powers of $x$ are $x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 18x = x(x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18)$.\nThe polynomial inside the parenthesis can be factored by grouping:\n$x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18 = x^4(x^2 - 2) - 9(x^2 - 2) = (x^4 - 9)(x^2 - 2) = (x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3)(x^2 - 2)$.\nThe terms with even powers of $x$ are $3x^2 - 6 = 3(x^2-2)$.\nSo, we can rewrite $f(x)$ as:\n$f(x) = x(x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3)(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nWe can factor out the term $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$f(x) = (x(x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3) + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x(x^4 - 9) + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The roots of $f(x)$ are the union of the roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of $h(x) = x^2 - 2$**\nThe roots of $h(x)$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a degree 2 extension, and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**\nFirst, we check for irreducibility of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The coefficients are 1, 0, 0, -9, 3.\n1. The prime $p=3$ does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n2. The prime $p=3$ divides all other coefficients (0, -9, 3).\n3. The square of the prime, $p^2=9$, does not divide the constant term 3.\nThus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $g(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, its Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ (where $K_g$ is the splitting field of $g(x)$) is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n\nNext, we find the number of real roots of $g(x)$. The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two critical points, which means $g(x)$ has at most three real roots.\nLet's evaluate $g(x)$ at the critical points:\n$x_1 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$: $g(x_1) = x_1^5 - 9x_1 + 3 = x_1(x_1^4 - 9) + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = -\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 < 0$. (Since $\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > \\sqrt[4]{1} = 1$, so $-\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} < -7.2$, making the value negative).\n$x_2 = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$: $g(x_2) = (-x_1)^5 - 9(-x_1) + 3 = -x_1^5 + 9x_1 + 3 = -g(x_1) + 6 = \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} - 3 + 6 = \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 > 0$.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots.\n\nThe complex conjugation is an automorphism of $K_g$ that swaps the two complex roots and fixes the three real roots. This corresponds to a transposition in the Galois group $G_g$. A transitive subgroup of $S_p$ for a prime $p$ that contains a transposition must be the full symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$, so $G_g \\cong S_5$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Galois group of $f(x)$**\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = K_g K_h = K_g(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $G_g \\times G_h \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$. The structure of $G$ depends on the intersection of the fields $K_g$ and $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe intersection $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The latter case happens if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_g$.\nThe subfields of $K_g$ correspond to subgroups of $S_5$. Quadratic subfields correspond to subgroups of index 2. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. The corresponding fixed field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, where $\\Delta$ is the discriminant of the polynomial $g(x)$.\nFor a polynomial $x^n+px+q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n q^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}p^n)$.\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, p=-9, q=3$.\n$\\Delta = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256(-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\nFor this to be $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we would need $-14863419 = 2m^2$ for some rational number $m$. This is impossible as the left side is an integer not divisible by 2 on the right side. So $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThus, $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5 \\times C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the degrees of normal sub-extensions**\nWe are looking for the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ correspond to proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}, C_2$.\n\n1.  **Product Subgroups**: Subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\triangleleft S_5$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft C_2$.\n    *   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=60$, Index $[G:H] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=120$, Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H|=2$, Index $[G:H] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H|=120$, Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Skew Subgroups**: These arise from isomorphisms between quotients of normal subgroups. The only non-trivial possibility is an isomorphism $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to C_2/\\{e\\}$. Both quotients are isomorphic to $C_2$. Let $c$ be the non-identity element of $C_2$. This gives rise to the normal subgroup:\n    $H_D = \\{(g, h) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\phi(gA_5) = h\\} = \\{(g,e) \\mid g \\in A_5\\} \\cup \\{(g,c) \\mid g \\in S_5 \\setminus A_5\\}$.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|H_D| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    The index is $[G:H_D] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 6: List the possible degrees**\nThe indices of the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$ are the possible degrees for the normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFrom our analysis, these indices are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nThe possible degrees are therefore 2, 4, and 120."
