    "This problem asks us to identify all nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number. Let's break down the problem, define the terms, and proceed with a step-by-step logical analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, we must have a clear understanding of the concepts involved.\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A non-empty subset $S$ of a group $G$ is called product-free if for any two elements $a, b \\in S$ (possibly $a=b$), their product $ab$ is not in $S$. This can be written concisely as $S^2 \\cap S = \\emptyset$. Note that this implies the identity element $e$ cannot be in $S$, since $e \\cdot e = e$.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS):** A product-free set $S$ is a MIPFS if it is not properly contained in any other product-free set in $G$. This means for any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n*   **A Set that Fills a Group:** A subset $S \\subseteq G$ is said to fill $G$ if every non-identity element of $G$ either belongs to $S$ or its inverse belongs to $S$. This can be written as $G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{e\\}$. For a set $S$ that fills $G$, if an element $g$ is not an involution (i.e., $g \\neq g^{-1}$), then exactly one of $g$ or $g^{-1}$ is in $S$. If $g$ is an involution ($g=g^{-1}, g \\neq e$), then $g$ must be in $S$.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group $G$ is called a filled group if *every* MIPFS in $G$ fills $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Characterization of Filled Groups\n\nThe definition of a filled group is quite strong and imposes severe restrictions on the group's structure. A key result in the study of these groups provides a complete characterization.\n\n**Theorem:** A finite group $G$ is a filled group if and only if $G$ is an elementary abelian 2-group, or $G$ is a group of exponent 3.\n*   An **elementary abelian 2-group** is a group isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. All non-identity elements have order 2, and the group is abelian.\n*   A **group of exponent 3** is a group in which every element $g$ satisfies $g^3 = e$. All non-identity elements have order 3. Such groups can be abelian (e.g., $(\\mathbb{Z}_3)^k$) or nonabelian.\n\nLet's briefly justify this theorem, as it's the cornerstone of our solution.\n1.  **Careful Point 1: Orders of elements in a filled group.**\n    Let $G$ be a filled group. Suppose there exists an element $x \\in G$ with order greater than 3. Then $x \\neq e$, $x^2 \\neq e$, and $x^3 \\neq e$. Consider the set $S_0 = \\{x, x^{-1}\\}$. Since $x^3 \\neq e$, we check the products: $x \\cdot x = x^2 \\notin S_0$, $x^{-1} \\cdot x^{-1} = x^{-2} \\notin S_0$, and $x \\cdot x^{-1} = e \\notin S_0$. Thus, $S_0$ is a product-free set. By Zorn's Lemma, we can extend $S_0$ to a MIPFS, let's call it $S$. Since $G$ is a filled group, this MIPFS $S$ must fill $G$. However, a set that fills $G$ can contain at most one of $x$ and $x^{-1}$ (since $x$ is not an involution). But we constructed $S$ to contain both. This is a contradiction. Therefore, a filled group cannot have elements of order greater than 3. All elements must have order 1, 2, or 3.\n\n2.  **Careful Point 2: Coexistence of elements of order 2 and 3.**\n    A further (and more difficult to prove) result states that if a filled group contains elements of order 2 and elements of order 3, it must be abelian. If we accept this, an abelian group with commuting elements $h$ (order 2) and $k$ (order 3) would have an element $hk$ of order $lcm(2,3)=6$. This contradicts our first point. Thus, a filled group cannot have elements of both order 2 and order 3.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of the characterization:**\n    From the two points above, a filled group must either have all its non-identity elements of order 2 (making it a 2-group of exponent 2, i.e., an elementary abelian 2-group) or have all its non-identity elements of order 3 (a group of exponent 3).\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Characterization to the Problem\n\nWe are looking for **nonabelian** filled groups of order $|G| = 2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\ge 1$ is a natural number. Based on the theorem, such a group $G$ must fall into one of two categories.\n\n*   **Case 1: G is an elementary abelian 2-group.**\n    Groups in this class are of the form $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. These groups are always abelian. The question explicitly asks for nonabelian groups. Therefore, no solution can be found in this case.\n    (Additionally, for completeness, the order of such a group is $2^k$. We would need $2q^m = 2^k$. Since $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\ge 1$, this is impossible.)\n\n*   **Case 2: G is a group of exponent 3.**\n    This means every element $g \\in G$ satisfies $g^3=e$. Consequently, the order of any element in $G$ must be a divisor of 3. The possible orders are 1 and 3.\n    Now consider the order of our group, $|G| = 2q^m$. Since $m \\ge 1$ and $q$ is an odd prime, the order of $G$ is an even number, meaning it is divisible by the prime 2.\n    By **Cauchy's Theorem**, if a prime $p$ divides the order of a finite group $G$, then $G$ must contain an element of order $p$.\n    In our case, since 2 divides $|G|$, the group $G$ must contain an element of order 2.\n    This leads to a direct contradiction: a group of exponent 3 cannot contain an element of order 2. Therefore, no group of order $2q^m$ can be a group of exponent 3.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have analyzed the two possible categories for filled groups and found that neither can accommodate a nonabelian group of order $2q^m$.\n\n*   The first category (elementary abelian 2-groups) is excluded because the groups are abelian.\n*   The second category (groups of exponent 3) is excluded because the group order $2q^m$ necessitates an element of order 2, which is impossible in a group of exponent 3.\n\nSince these two categories exhaust all possibilities for filled groups, we must conclude that there are no such groups.\n\n**Example Check:** Consider the smallest possible nonabelian group of the given form: $q=3, m=1$, so $|G| = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$. The only nonabelian group of order 6 is the symmetric group $S_3$. Its elements have orders 1, 2, and 3. We can find a MIPFS in $S_3$, for instance, the set of all its involutions $S = \\{(12), (13), (23)\\}$. This set is a MIPFS. However, $S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{e\\} = S \\cup \\{e\\}$, which does not contain the elements of order 3, $(123)$ and $(132)$. Thus, $S$ does not fill $S_3$. Since not all MIPFSs in $S_3$ fill it, $S_3$ is not a filled group. This is consistent with our conclusion.\n\n<<<There are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for any odd prime q and natural number m.>>>"
