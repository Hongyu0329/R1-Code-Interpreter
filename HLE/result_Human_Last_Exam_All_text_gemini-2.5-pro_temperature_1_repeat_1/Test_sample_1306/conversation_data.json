    "This problem requires an analysis of the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. We need to determine the set of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations and identify which of them are irreducible. The percentage is the ratio of the number of irreducible representations to the total number of indecomposable representations.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the context: Quantum groups at roots of unity\n\nThe representation theory of a quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ depends critically on the parameter $q$.\n*   **Generic Case:** When $q$ is not a root of unity, the category of finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is semisimple. In a semisimple category, every representation can be decomposed into a direct sum of simple (irreducible) representations. This implies that the indecomposable representations are precisely the irreducible ones. So, in the generic case, the percentage would be 100%.\n*   **Root of Unity Case:** The question specifies that $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let $l=3$ be the smallest positive integer such that $q^l=1$. When $q$ is a root of unity, the representation theory is vastly different and is not semisimple. This means there exist representations that are indecomposable but not irreducible. Our task is to find out how many of each type exist.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the irreducible representations\n\nThe irreducible (or simple) representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive $l$-th root of unity are well-classified.\n*   The simple modules are denoted by $L_k$. They have dimension $k$.\n*   The possible dimensions are restricted to $1 \\le k \\le l-1$.\n*   In our case, $l=3$. So, the possible dimensions are $k=1$ and $k=2$.\n*   This means there are exactly **two** non-isomorphic irreducible representations:\n    1.  $L_1$: The trivial representation of dimension 1.\n    2.  $L_2$: An irreducible representation of dimension 2.\n\nSo, the total number of non-isomorphic irreducible objects in the category $C$ is 2.\n\n### Step 3: Classify all indecomposable representations\n\nThis is the most crucial step. Since the category is not semisimple, we must find all indecomposable representations, not just the irreducible ones. The category of representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $l=3$ is of **tame representation type**. This means that the indecomposable objects can be classified, and they fall into a finite number of discrete modules and a finite number of one-parameter families.\n\nThe classification of indecomposable modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $l=3$ is as follows:\n1.  **The irreducible modules:** $L_1$ and $L_2$. As every irreducible module is also indecomposable, these two are on our list.\n2.  **The projective indecomposable modules:** For each simple module $L_k$, there is a corresponding projective cover $P_k$.\n    *   For $L_1$, its projective cover $P_1$ is a module of dimension 4 which is indecomposable but not irreducible. It has both $L_1$ and $L_2$ as composition factors.\n    *   For $L_2$, it turns out that $L_2$ itself is a projective module. So, $P_2 = L_2$. This means $L_2$ is already accounted for in our list.\n    *   This adds one new indecomposable module to our list: $P_1$.\n3.  **Regular modules (continuous families):** This is the key feature of tame representation type. There exists a continuous family of indecomposable modules. For $l=3$, there is a family of indecomposable modules of dimension $l=3$.\n    *   These modules are parameterized by a point on the projective line, $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$. Let's denote them $R_\\lambda$.\n    *   For each $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$, $R_\\lambda$ is an indecomposable module of dimension 3.\n    *   None of these modules are irreducible. For example, the standard module $V_3$ is in this family and it is a non-split extension of $L_1$ by $L_2$ (or vice-versa, depending on the highest weight).\n    *   Since $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$ is an infinite set (it is the complex plane plus a point at infinity), this constitutes an **infinite** number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the percentage\n\nNow we assemble the counts.\n*   **Number of irreducible objects:** 2 (namely $L_1$ and $L_2$).\n*   **Number of indecomposable objects:** The set of indecomposable objects consists of $L_1$, $L_2$, $P_1$, and the infinite family $\\{R_\\lambda\\}_{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})}$.\n    *   The total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects is $3 + |\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})| = \\infty$.\n\nThe percentage of objects of $C$ that are irreducible is the ratio of the number of irreducible objects to the total number of indecomposable objects.\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{|\\text{Irreducible Objects}|}{|\\text{Indecomposable Objects}|} \\times 100\\% $$\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{2}{\\infty} \\times 100\\% $$\n\nA finite number divided by infinity is zero.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n1.  **Indecomposable vs. Irreducible:** This distinction is the core of the problem and only arises because $q$ is a root of unity, making the category non-semisimple.\n2.  **Classification of Representations:** The result hinges on the classification of representations for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at a root of unity, which shows the category is of tame type.\n3.  **Infinite Families:** The existence of a continuous family of indecomposable modules means there are infinitely many non-isomorphic objects in the category.\n4.  **Meaning of \"Percentage\":** When dealing with a set containing a finite number of \"special\" objects (the irreducibles) and an infinite number of \"generic\" objects (the non-irreducible indecomposables), the percentage of special objects is considered to be zero.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   Let $I$ be the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible objects in $C$. We found $|I|=2$.\n*   Let $D$ be the set of isomorphism classes of all indecomposable objects in $C$. We found that $D$ contains the two irreducible objects, one other discrete indecomposable object ($P_1$), and an infinite family of indecomposable objects $\\{R_\\lambda\\}$. Thus, $|D|=\\infty$.\n*   The required percentage is $(|I| / |D|) \\times 100$.\n*   This gives $(2 / \\infty) \\times 100 = 0$.\n\nThe percentage of the objects of $C$ that are irreducible is 0%.\n\n<<<0>>>"
