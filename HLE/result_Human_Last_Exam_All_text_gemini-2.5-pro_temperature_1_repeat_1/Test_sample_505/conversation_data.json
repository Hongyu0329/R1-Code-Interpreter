    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Logical Qubits in a Single Surface Code Patch\n\nA surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. The number of logical qubits it can encode depends on the topology of the 2D surface on which it is laid out. We will assume each \"patch\" is a planar code, which is topologically equivalent to a disk and has boundaries.\n\n*   **A single patch with no holes:** This is the standard planar code. It has outer boundaries. By defining logical operators as strings of Pauli operators that connect opposite boundaries, it can encode **1 logical qubit**.\n\n*   **A single patch with holes:** When we introduce a \"hole\" (or a puncture) into the patch, we create a new inner boundary. This new topological feature allows for the definition of a new, independent pair of logical operators. One operator loops around the hole, and its corresponding partner connects the hole's boundary to the outer boundary.\n    *   Each hole adds the capacity to encode one additional logical qubit.\n    *   Therefore, for a single patch with `$h$` holes, the number of logical qubits it can encode is given by the formula:\n        `$k_{patch} = h + 1$`\n\nLet's verify this formula:\n*   For `$h=0$` holes, `$k = 0 + 1 = 1$`. This matches the standard planar code.\n*   For `$h=1$` hole, `$k = 1 + 1 = 2$`.\n*   For `$h=2$` holes, `$k = 2 + 1 = 3$`.\n\n### Step 2: Combining Multiple Patches\n\nThe problem specifies \"two patches of surface code\". These are two physically separate, non-interacting surface code lattices. The total number of logical qubits in such a system is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n\n*   If we have Patch 1 and Patch 2, the total number of logical qubits is:\n    `$k_{total} = k_{patch1} + k_{patch2}$`\n\n### Step 3: Distributing the Holes to Maximize Logical Qubits\n\nWe are given a total of two patches and a total of two holes. We want to find the *maximum* number of logical qubits. To do this, we need to consider how distributing the two holes between the two patches affects the total count.\n\nLet `$h_1$` be the number of holes in Patch 1 and `$h_2$` be the number of holes in Patch 2.\nWe are given that the total number of holes is 2, so `$h_1 + h_2 = 2$`.\n\nThe total number of logical qubits is:\n`$k_{total} = k_{patch1} + k_{patch2}$`\nUsing the formula from Step 1:\n`$k_{total} = (h_1 + 1) + (h_2 + 1)$`\n`$k_{total} = h_1 + h_2 + 2$`\n\nNow, we can substitute the total number of holes:\n`$k_{total} = (h_1 + h_2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4$`\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Maximum\n\nTo be certain this is the maximum, let's check the possible distributions of the two holes:\n\n*   **Case A: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   Patch 1: `$h_1 = 1$`.  `$k_1 = 1 + 1 = 2$` logical qubits.\n    *   Patch 2: `$h_2 = 1$`.  `$k_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$` logical qubits.\n    *   Total: `$k_{total} = 2 + 2 = 4$` logical qubits.\n\n*   **Case B: Both holes in one patch.**\n    *   Patch 1: `$h_1 = 2$`.  `$k_1 = 2 + 1 = 3$` logical qubits.\n    *   Patch 2: `$h_2 = 0$`.  `$k_2 = 0 + 1 = 1$` logical qubit.\n    *   Total: `$k_{total} = 3 + 1 = 4$` logical qubits.\n\nBoth distributions yield the same result. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n\n1.  **Patch Topology:** Each patch is treated as a planar code (topologically a disk), not a toric code (which has no boundaries and encodes `$2g$` qubits, where `$g$` is the genus).\n2.  **Hole Definition:** A \"hole\" is a puncture that creates an inner boundary, which is the standard method for increasing the qubit capacity of a planar code.\n3.  **Patch Independence:** The patches are separate, so their qubit capacities are additive.\n4.  **Formula:** The key is the formula `$k = h + 1$` for a single planar patch with `$h$` holes.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   Number of logical qubits from patches themselves: 1 per patch * 2 patches = 2\n*   Number of logical qubits from holes: 1 per hole * 2 holes = 2\n*   Total logical qubits = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nThe final answer is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
