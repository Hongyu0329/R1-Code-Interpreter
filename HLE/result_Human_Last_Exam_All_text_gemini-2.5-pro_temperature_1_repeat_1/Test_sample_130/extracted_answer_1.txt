The edges are progressively smoothed out. This process reduces the curvature of the edges, causing them to move. Specifically, convex parts of a region shrink and concave parts fill in. As a result, any closed boundary (like an object's outline) will shrink and eventually disappear. Any open edge will evolve towards a straight line (a curve with zero curvature), which is a stable state for the operator.
