    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the functions and their properties.**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\nLet $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\nLet $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n$f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$. For this quadratic to be always positive, the parabola it represents must open upwards and have no real roots. This means:\n1. The leading coefficient must be positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$.\n2. The discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\nSimilarly, for $g'(x) > 0$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\nThe condition $f'(x)>0$ implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. Likewise, $g(x)$ is also strictly increasing.\n\n**Step 2: Define the problem in terms of an equation.**\nWe are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $f(g(x)) = x$.\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We need to find the maximum number of real roots of the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the composite function h(x).**\nThe degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of their degrees.\nDegree of $h(x) = (\\text{Degree of } f) \\times (\\text{Degree of } g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nSo, $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\nThe equation for the fixed points is $h(x) - x = 0$. This is also a polynomial equation of degree 9.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 has at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the properties of h(x) to see if 9 roots is possible.**\nLet's examine the derivative of $h(x)$ using the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nWe are given that $f'(y) > 0$ for any real number $y$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for any real number $x$.\nSince $g(x)$ produces a real number, $f'(g(x))$ is positive.\nThus, $h'(x)$ is a product of two positive numbers, which means $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\nThis tells us that $h(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, just like $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. It has no local maxima or minima.\n\n**Step 5: Use Rolle's Theorem to relate the number of roots of a function to its derivatives.**\nLet $P(x) = h(x) - x$. We want to find the maximum number of real roots of $P(x)=0$.\nRolle's Theorem states that if a differentiable function has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\nLet's apply this repeatedly.\n*   If $P(x) = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n*   If $P'(x) = 0$ has 8 distinct real roots, then its derivative $P''(x) = h''(x)$ must have at least 7 distinct real roots.\n\n**Step 6: Check if these conditions on the derivatives are possible.**\nLet's determine the degree of $h''(x)$.\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n$h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x)) = (f''(g(x))g'(x))g'(x) + f'(g(x))g''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n\nLet's find the degrees of the terms:\n*   $f(x)$ is degree 3 $\\implies f'(x)$ is degree 2 $\\implies f''(x)$ is degree 1.\n*   $g(x)$ is degree 3 $\\implies g'(x)$ is degree 2 $\\implies g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n\nNow, let's find the degrees of the terms in $h''(x)$:\n*   Degree of $f''(g(x))$ is $1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n*   Degree of $(g'(x))^2$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   Degree of $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$ is $3 + 4 = 7$.\n\n*   Degree of $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   Degree of $g''(x)$ is $1$.\n*   Degree of $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nThe leading terms of these two parts do not cancel out, so the degree of $h''(x)$ is 7.\nA polynomial of degree 7 can have at most 7 real roots. So, it is possible for $h''(x)$ to have 7 real roots.\n\nIf $h''(x)$ has 7 real roots, then $h'(x)$ has 7 local extrema. $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A sketch of a degree 8 polynomial with 7 local extrema (like a \"W\" with more wiggles) shows that it can intersect a horizontal line (like $y=1$) at up to 8 distinct points. Thus, it is possible for $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = 0$ to have 8 real roots.\n\nIf $P'(x)$ has 8 real roots, then $P(x)$ has 8 local extrema. A sketch of a degree 9 polynomial $P(x)$ with 8 local extrema shows that it can cross the x-axis up to 9 times. This requires the values of the local extrema to alternate in sign (e.g., local max > 0, local min < 0). The constant terms $a_0$ and $b_0$ in the polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ provide the freedom to shift the graph of $P(x)$ vertically without changing its derivative, which allows us to position it to have 9 real roots.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of fixed points is the number of roots of the degree 9 polynomial $f(g(x)) - x$. This number cannot exceed 9. The analysis of the derivatives shows that there is no structural reason preventing the existence of 9 real roots. It is possible to construct such polynomials $f$ and $g$ that result in 9 fixed points. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
