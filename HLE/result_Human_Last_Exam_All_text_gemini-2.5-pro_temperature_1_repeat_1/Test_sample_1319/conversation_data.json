    "This question requires identifying all historical mountains mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, finding their real-world elevations, and then determining the second tallest after Mount Olympus.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.**\nFirst, we must compile a list of mountains that are explicitly named or clearly referenced in the epic poem. The main contenders are:\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, central to the narrative.\n*   **Mount Ida:** The mountain near Troy from which Zeus often observes the battle. It is important to distinguish this from Mount Ida on Crete.\n*   **Samothrace:** The island mountain from which Poseidon watches the war. Its peak is called Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned by Hera as she travels from Olympus to Lemnos.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned as the source of the wood for Achilles' spear.\n*   **Mount Ossa:** Mentioned alongside Pelion in the context of the giants' war against the gods.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned as a landmark in Lydia, home of the Maeonian allies of Troy.\n*   **Lemnos and Imbros:** Islands mentioned in the epic, which are also volcanic and mountainous.\n\n**Step 2: Confirm these are \"historical\" mountains and find their elevations.**\nAll the locations listed above correspond to real geographical features. We now need to find their modern, accepted elevations to compare them.\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft)\n*   **Mount Tmolus** (modern Bozdağ, Turkey): 2,159 meters (7,083 ft)\n*   **Mount Athos** (Greece): 2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n*   **Mount Ossa** (modern Kissavos, Greece): 1,978 meters (6,490 ft)\n*   **Mount Ida** (modern Kaz Dağı, Turkey): 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion** (Greece): 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n*   **Samothrace** (peak Fengari, Greece): 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n*   **Imbros** (peak İlyas Dağ, Turkey): 673 meters (2,208 ft)\n*   **Lemnos** (peak Vigla, Greece): 470 meters (1,540 ft)\n\n**Step 3: Exclude Mount Olympus and rank the remaining mountains.**\nThe question asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus. Removing Olympus from the list, we can rank the remaining mountains by height:\n1.  **Mount Tmolus** (2,159 m)\n2.  Mount Athos (2,033 m)\n3.  Mount Ossa (1,978 m)\n4.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n5.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n6.  Samothrace (1,611 m)\n7.  Imbros (673 m)\n8.  Lemnos (470 m)\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Identifying the correct Mount Ida:** The *Iliad* refers to Mount Ida in Anatolia (modern Turkey), not the taller Mount Ida on Crete. This is a crucial distinction.\n*   **Verifying the mention:** Each mountain must be confirmed as being mentioned within the text of the *Iliad*. Mount Tmolus is mentioned in Book 2 in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" as being near the Gygaean Lake, home of the Maeonians.\n*   **Using accurate elevations:** The final comparison relies on modern geographical data for the mountains' heights.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter Mount Olympus, the historical mountain with the highest elevation mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
