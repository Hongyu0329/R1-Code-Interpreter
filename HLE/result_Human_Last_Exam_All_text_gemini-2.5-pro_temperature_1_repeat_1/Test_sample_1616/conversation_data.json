    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a historical sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the third-to-last syllable of a word (the antepenultimate syllable). This typically occurs when a suffix is added to a base word.\n\nThe key is to identify a pair of related words: a base word with a tense vowel and a derived word (of three or more syllables) where that same vowel has become lax.\n\nHere are the common tense-lax vowel pairs involved in TSL:\n*   /iː/ (as in *ser**e**ne*) → /ɛ/ (as in *ser**e**nity*)\n*   /eɪ/ (as in *prof**a**ne*) → /æ/ (as in *prof**a**nity*)\n*   /aɪ/ (as in *div**i**ne*) → /ɪ/ (as in *div**i**nity*)\n*   /oʊ/ (as in *c**o**ne*) → /ɒ/ (as in *c**o**nic*)\n*   /uː/ (as in *s**ou**th*) → /ʌ/ (as in *s**ou**thern*)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nWe will examine each word by identifying its base, the vowel in question, and whether the characteristic vowel change of TSL has occurred.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Base Word:** *south*\n    *   **Vowel in Base:** The \"ou\" in *south* was historically a tense vowel /uː/ (pronounced like \"sooth\").\n    *   **Derived Word:** *southern* (pronounced /ˈsʌðərn/).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The vowel sound changes from tense /uː/ to lax /ʌ/.\n    *   **Syllable Position:** In *southern*, the vowel is in the first of two syllables. Although the resulting word is not trisyllabic, this is a classic example of the same laxing process.\n    *   **Conclusion:** *southern* **has undergone** this laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Base Word:** *derive*\n    *   **Vowel in Base:** The \"i\" in *derive* is a tense vowel /aɪ/ (as in \"I\").\n    *   **Derived Word:** *derivative* (pronounced /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/). The word has four syllables.\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The vowel sound in the corresponding syllable changes from tense /aɪ/ to lax /ɪ/ (as in \"it\").\n    *   **Syllable Position:** The vowel /ɪ/ is in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** *derivative* **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Base Word:** *serene*\n    *   **Vowel in Base:** The second \"e\" in *serene* is a tense vowel /iː/ (as in \"ee\").\n    *   **Derived Word:** *serenity* (pronounced /səˈrɛnəti/). The word has four syllables.\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The vowel sound changes from tense /iː/ to lax /ɛ/ (as in \"bed\").\n    *   **Syllable Position:** The vowel /ɛ/ is in the antepenultimate syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** *serenity* **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Base Word:** *please*\n    *   **Vowel in Base:** The \"ea\" in *please* is a tense vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Derived Word:** *pleasant* (pronounced /ˈplɛzənt/).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The vowel sound changes from tense /iː/ to lax /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllable Position:** Similar to *southern*, the resulting word is disyllabic, but the historical change is the same as TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** *pleasant* **has undergone** this laxing.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Base Word:** The related base word is *grate* (as in *grateful*).\n    *   **Vowel in Base:** The \"a\" in *grate* is a tense vowel /eɪ/ (as in \"ate\").\n    *   **Derived Word:** *gratitude* (pronounced /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/). The word has three syllables.\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The vowel sound in the first syllable changes from tense /eɪ/ to lax /æ/ (as in \"cat\").\n    *   **Syllable Position:** The vowel /æ/ is in the antepenultimate syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** *gratitude* **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Base Word:** The word comes from Old English *sceadu*.\n    *   **Vowel in Base:** In its Old English origin, the first vowel \"ea\" (ash) was a **lax/short** vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Derived Word:** *shadow* (pronounced /ˈʃædoʊ/).\n    *   **Vowel Change:** There is no change from a tense vowel to a lax vowel. The vowel in the first syllable has been historically lax. Trisyllabic laxing requires a tense vowel in the base form to be \"laxed\" or \"shortened.\" Since the vowel in *shadow* was never tense to begin with, it could not have undergone this process.\n    *   **Conclusion:** *shadow* **has not undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, every word on the list except for *shadow* shows a clear pattern of a tense vowel in a base word becoming lax in a derived form, which is the definition of trisyllabic laxing. The vowel in *shadow* was historically lax and did not undergo this change.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
