    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Given Information:**\n    *   `x(n)` and `h(n)` are 4-point sequences.\n    *   `X(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `x(n)`, and `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`.\n    *   `H(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `h(n)`, and `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n    *   We need to find the DFT of a new 8-point sequence `y(n)`.\n\n2.  **The New Sequence:**\n    *   The new sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n    *   This is an 8-point sequence (`N=8`).\n    *   This sequence is formed by interleaving the elements of `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\n3.  **Core Concept:**\n    *   The problem can be solved using the properties of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), specifically the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) algorithm. This algorithm relates the DFT of a sequence of length `N` to the DFTs of its even-indexed and odd-indexed subsequences, each of length `N/2`.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Define the even and odd parts of the sequence `y(n)`**\n\nLet `y(n)` be the 8-point sequence. We can split it into two 4-point sequences:\n*   The even-indexed part, `y_e(n) = y(2n)`.\n    `y_e(n) = {y(0), y(2), y(4), y(6)} = {x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)}`. So, `y_e(n) = x(n)`.\n*   The odd-indexed part, `y_o(n) = y(2n+1)`.\n    `y_o(n) = {y(1), y(3), y(5), y(7)} = {h(0), h(1), h(2), h(3)}`. So, `y_o(n) = h(n)`.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT Formula**\n\nThe `N`-point DFT of `y(n)`, denoted as `Y(k)`, can be computed from the `N/2`-point DFTs of its even and odd parts. In our case, `N=8` and `N/2=4`.\n\nThe 4-point DFT of `y_e(n) = x(n)` is given as `X(k)`.\nThe 4-point DFT of `y_o(n) = h(n)` is given as `H(k)`.\n\nThe DIT-FFT formulas are:\n*   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `Y(k + 4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nwhere `W_N^k = e^{-j2\\pi k/N}` is the twiddle factor.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required Twiddle Factors `W_8^k`**\n\nWe need `W_8^k` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^{-j2\\pi/8} = e^{-j\\pi/4} = cos(\\pi/4) - j*sin(\\pi/4) = (1 - j) / \\sqrt{2}`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^{-j4\\pi/8} = e^{-j\\pi/2} = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^{-j6\\pi/8} = e^{-j3\\pi/4} = cos(3\\pi/4) - j*sin(3\\pi/4) = (-1 - j) / \\sqrt{2}`\n\n**Step 4: Compute the 8-point DFT `Y(k)`**\n\nWe will now compute `Y(k)` for `k = 0` to `7` using the formulas from Step 2.\n\n*   **For k = 0:**\n    *   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n    *   `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k = 1:**\n    *   `W_8^1 * H(1) = ((1 - j) / \\sqrt{2}) * (1 + j) = (1 - j^2) / \\sqrt{2} = (1 + 1) / \\sqrt{2} = 2 / \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}`\n    *   `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + \\sqrt{2}`\n    *   `Y(5) = X(1) - W_8^1 * H(1) = j - \\sqrt{2}`\n\n*   **For k = 2:**\n    *   `W_8^2 * H(2) = (-j) * 1 = -j`\n    *   `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n    *   `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n*   **For k = 3:**\n    *   `W_8^3 * H(3) = ((-1 - j) / \\sqrt{2}) * (1 - j) = (-1 + j - j + j^2) / \\sqrt{2} = (-1 - 1) / \\sqrt{2} = -2 / \\sqrt{2} = -\\sqrt{2}`\n    *   `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + (-\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2} - j`\n    *   `Y(7) = X(3) - W_8^3 * H(3) = -j - (-\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2} - j`\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the final DFT sequence `Y(k)`**\n\nCombining all the calculated values, we get the 8-point DFT:\n`Y(k) = {Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), Y(6), Y(7)}`\n`Y(k) = [1, \\sqrt{2} + j, -1 - j, -\\sqrt{2} - j, 1, -\\sqrt{2} + j, -1 + j, \\sqrt{2} - j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
