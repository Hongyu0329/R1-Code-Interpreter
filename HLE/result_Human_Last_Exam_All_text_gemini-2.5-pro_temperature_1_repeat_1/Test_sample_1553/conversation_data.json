    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Book:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Subject:** The main character of the novel.\n*   **Action:** Marrying another character.\n*   **Goal:** To find the name of the character who is married by the protagonist.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a 21st-century human who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the relationships of the main character.**\nAdam Zamoyski's primary and most significant relationship throughout the novel is with a post-human entity (\"stahs\") named Angelika. She is his guide, guardian, and the one who initiated his resurrection. Their bond evolves from one of a subject and researcher to a deep, intimate connection.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the meaning of \"marries\" in the context of the novel.**\nThe world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a far-future, post-human reality where concepts like traditional human marriage do not directly apply. However, the relationship between Adam and Angelika culminates in a form of profound union or fusion. This joining of their consciousnesses and existences is the closest equivalent to marriage within the narrative's context.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the name of the character.**\nBased on the deep, culminating union between the protagonist Adam Zamoyski and his guide, the character he effectively \"marries\" is Angelika.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The term \"marries\" should be interpreted loosely, as the novel deals with post-human concepts where a traditional marriage ceremony or legal contract is not depicted. The question refers to the character with whom the protagonist forms the most profound and permanent bond, akin to marriage.\n*   The central relationship in the book is unequivocally between Adam Zamoyski and Angelika. There are no other significant romantic interests for Adam that lead to a similar union.\n*   Identifying the main character correctly (Adam Zamoyski) is crucial to answering the question.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a deep, life-altering union with the post-human being who resurrected him. Her name is Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
