    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific text—a \"book of manners\"—that was physically preserved in the same document as another specific text, the poem \"Sir Launfal\".\n2.  **Identify \"Sir Launfal\":** \"Sir Launfal\" is a 14th-century Middle English romance poem written by Thomas Chestre. Such texts from this period survive in handwritten manuscripts.\n3.  **Understand \"Preserved Alongside\":** This phrase implies that the two works are found together in the same historical manuscript. Our task is to identify this manuscript and then find the \"book of manners\" within it.\n4.  **Locate the Manuscript:** The only surviving manuscript that contains Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal* is a famous collection of Middle English texts known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**. This manuscript is held in the British Library.\n5.  **Examine the Manuscript's Contents:** Now we must look at the other works contained in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript. This manuscript is a compilation that includes other well-known works like *The Owl and the Nightingale* and *Laȝamon's Brut*.\n6.  **Find the \"Book of Manners\":** We need to search the list of contents for a text that fits the description of a \"book of manners\" or a \"courtesy book.\" These were instructional poems on etiquette, social conduct, and courtly behavior.\n7.  **Identify the Specific Text:** Within the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript, there is indeed a poem on etiquette. This work is known as ***The Boke of Curtasye*** (often modernized as *The Book of Courtesy*). It provides guidance on topics like table manners and proper conduct in a lord's household.\n8.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the book of manners preserved alongside *Sir Launfal* in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii is *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Manuscript Specificity:** The connection between the two works is entirely dependent on their co-existence in a single, specific manuscript (Cotton Caligula A.ii). Without this manuscript, there would be no direct link.\n*   **Genre vs. Title:** \"Book of manners\" is a genre description. The actual title of the work in the manuscript is *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n*   **Distinguishing Versions:** It's important to be sure we are talking about Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal*, as there are other related stories (like Marie de France's *Lanval*), which are found in different manuscripts. The question implicitly refers to the Middle English poem.\n\n***\n\nThe book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is *The Boke of Curtasye*, or *The Book of Courtesy*."
