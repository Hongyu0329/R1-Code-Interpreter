    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Graph Structure**\n\n*   **Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge, known as the bridge or bottleneck edge.\n*   **10 Nodes:** With a total of 10 nodes, the most symmetric and standard construction for a barbell graph is to have two cliques of 5 nodes each. Let's call them Clique A and Clique B.\n    *   Clique A is a complete graph on 5 nodes (a K5).\n    *   Clique B is also a complete graph on 5 nodes (a K5).\n*   **The Bottleneck Edge:** A single edge connects one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B. Let's call the node from Clique A `u` and the node from Clique B `v`. The bottleneck edge is `(u, v)`.\n*   **Uniform Weights:** All edges have the same weight. In uniform gossiping, this means every neighbor has an equal chance of being selected.\n\n**2. Understand the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process**\n\nA single step of this gossiping algorithm involves two stages of random selection:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from all `N=10` nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N = 1/10`.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to send a message to. If the selected node has `k` neighbors (i.e., its degree is `k`), the probability of it choosing any specific neighbor is `1/k`.\n\nThe \"sampling of an edge\" refers to the edge that is chosen for this communication.\n\n**3. Identify the Target Event**\n\nWe want to find the probability that the bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled in a single step. This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n*   **Case 1:** Node `u` is selected first, and then it chooses node `v` as its neighbor.\n*   **Case 2:** Node `v` is selected first, and then it chooses node `u` as its neighbor.\n\nThe total probability will be the sum of the probabilities of these two cases.\n`P(sample edge (u,v)) = P(Case 1) + P(Case 2)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of Case 1**\n\n*   **Probability of selecting node `u`:** As there are 10 nodes in total, `P(select u) = 1/10`.\n*   **Probability of `u` choosing `v`:** To find this, we first need the degree of node `u`.\n    *   Node `u` is part of Clique A (a K5). It is connected to the other 4 nodes within its clique.\n    *   Node `u` is also connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of `u` is `degree(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   Given that `u` is selected, the probability that it chooses its neighbor `v` is `P(u chooses v | u is selected) = 1 / degree(u) = 1/5`.\n*   The total probability for Case 1 is the product of these probabilities: `P(Case 1) = P(select u) * P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability of Case 2**\n\n*   **Probability of selecting node `v`:** Similarly, `P(select v) = 1/10`.\n*   **Probability of `v` choosing `u`:** We need the degree of node `v`. By symmetry with node `u`:\n    *   Node `v` is part of Clique B (a K5). It is connected to the other 4 nodes within its clique.\n    *   Node `v` is also connected to node `u` via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of `v` is `degree(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   Given that `v` is selected, the probability that it chooses its neighbor `u` is `P(v chooses u | v is selected) = 1 / degree(v) = 1/5`.\n*   The total probability for Case 2 is: `P(Case 2) = P(select v) * P(v chooses u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of the two cases:\n`P(total) = P(Case 1) + P(Case 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50`\n`P(total) = 1/25`\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives `0.04`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Graph Model:** Correctly interpreting the \"10-node barbell graph\" as two K5 cliques connected by a single edge is the most critical first step.\n2.  **Gossiping Process:** It is essential to understand that gossiping is a two-step random process (node selection, then neighbor selection), not a single-step process of picking an edge from all available edges.\n3.  **Degree Calculation:** The degrees of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge are crucial. A common mistake would be to only count connections within the clique (degree 4) and forget the bridge connection.\n4.  **Symmetry:** Recognizing the symmetry of the graph and the problem (nodes `u` and `v` are interchangeable) simplifies the calculation.\n5.  **Mutual Exclusivity:** The two cases for sampling the edge are mutually exclusive (in a single step, either `u` initiates or `v` initiates, but not both), so their probabilities can be simply added together.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Graph:** Two K5 cliques connected by one edge. Total nodes N=10.\n*   **Bottleneck edge endpoints:** `u` and `v`.\n*   **Degree of `u`:** `(5-1) + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Degree of `v`:** `(5-1) + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Probability of sampling:** `P(u selected) * P(u chooses v) + P(v selected) * P(v chooses u)`\n    *   `(1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5)`\n    *   `1/50 + 1/50`\n    *   `2/50 = 1/25 = 0.04`\n\n<<<0.04>>>"
