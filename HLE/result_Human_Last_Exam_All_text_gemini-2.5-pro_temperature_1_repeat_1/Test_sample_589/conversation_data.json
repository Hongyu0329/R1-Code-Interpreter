    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe query asks for a specific scene from a specific type of film. Let's break down the key elements that must be present in the correct answer:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Object:** The teenager is riding a pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n\nEach of these points is a crucial filter that helps eliminate incorrect movies and pinpoint the correct one.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Eliminate Common but Incorrect Guesses\n\nThis specific combination of elements is designed to be very precise. Many popular films feature some of these elements, but not all of them, making them incorrect answers.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Bike's Color.** The color \"pink\" is a very specific visual detail. It's not a standard red, blue, or black bike. This immediately rules out many films. For example, in **_It_** (2017), Beverly Marsh rides a light blue/teal bike, not a pink one.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Character's Age.** The character must be a \"teenager.\" This eliminates films where a younger child might be involved. For example, in **_A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge_** (1985), there is a memorable scene involving a child on a pink *tricycle* in the path of a school bus, but the character is a little girl, not a teenager.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Specific Action.** The action is \"pedal directly toward an oncoming car.\" This implies a moment of defiance, a confrontation, or a game of chicken. This is different from an escape or an accident. For example, in **_E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_** (1982), the kids on bikes are escaping from authorities and famously fly *over* the cars, not pedal *at* them.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Major Studio Production.** The film must be a mainstream Hollywood production. This excludes independent films or television movies that might contain similar scenes.\n\nBy holding fast to all these specific details, we can move past the most common (but incorrect) movie suggestions.\n\n### Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nCombining all the specific criteria from the question leads us to a 1990s teen comedy-drama.\n\n1.  **Film Identification:** The film is **_Angus_** (1995).\n2.  **Studio Check:** It was produced by Turner Pictures and distributed by New Line Cinema, which is considered a major Hollywood studio. This fits the criteria.\n3.  **Character Check:** The scene involves the main character's best friend, Troy Wedensky, who is a teenager.\n4.  **Object Check:** Troy, who is small for his age, rides a small, pink girl's bicycle, complete with training wheels. This is a perfect match for the \"pink bike\" detail.\n5.  **Action Check:** In a key scene, the school bully, Rick Sanford, tries to run Troy off the road with his car. In a surprising act of courage and defiance, Troy turns his little pink bike around and pedals **directly toward** Rick's oncoming convertible. This act of bravery forces the bully to swerve at the last second to avoid a head-on collision.\n\nThis scene from _Angus_ perfectly matches every single specific detail provided in the question.\n\n<<<Angus"
