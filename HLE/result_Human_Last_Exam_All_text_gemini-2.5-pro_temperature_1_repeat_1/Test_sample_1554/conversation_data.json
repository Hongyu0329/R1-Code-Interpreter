    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Belonging to the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy.\n    *   **Specific Contribution:** Decomposed the concept of a \"hallmark\" (a characteristic or sign).\n    *   **The Decomposition:** Into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was a highly influential school of logic and analytical philosophy in Poland, active primarily between the two World Wars.\n    *   Its founder was Kazimierz Twardowski.\n    *   Prominent members include Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   The school is known for its emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and analysis of language and scientific concepts.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction: \"Symptoms\" vs. \"Signals\"**\n    *   This is a distinction within the theory of signs (semiotics) and epistemology (the theory of knowledge). It addresses the different ways one thing can indicate another.\n    *   **Symptom (Polish: *objaw*)**: This is a *natural sign*. The relationship between the symptom and what it indicates is based on a natural, often causal, connection. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. This connection is discovered in the world, not created by agreement.\n    *   **Signal (Polish: *sygnał*)**: This is a *conventional sign* (also sometimes referred to simply as a *znak* or sign). The relationship between the signal and what it indicates is based on a rule, agreement, or convention. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"dog\" is a signal for a canine animal. This connection is established by humans.\n\n4.  **Connect the Philosopher to the Distinction:**\n    *   We need to find which philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School is known for this specific analysis.\n    *   By examining the works of the school's major figures, particularly those who focused on epistemology and the philosophy of language, we can pinpoint the correct individual.\n    *   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the philosopher most famously associated with this distinction. In his works, such as \"Language and Meaning,\" he extensively analyzed the nature of signs and evidence. He used the distinction between symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) to clarify how we acquire knowledge and understand language. He analyzed how we recognize properties (hallmarks) of objects through these different kinds of indicators.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The question refers to a specific semiotic distinction.\n    *   This distinction was developed by a member of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n    *   The philosopher responsible for this analysis is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is an acquisition of the step-by-step analysis.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
