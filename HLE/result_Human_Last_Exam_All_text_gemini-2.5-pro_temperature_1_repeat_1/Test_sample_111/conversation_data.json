    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and the date of the event.**\n*   **Key Figures:** Geoffrey Chaucer, the poet, and Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt.\n*   **Key Event:** The death of Blanche of Lancaster.\n*   **Date of Event:** Historical records confirm that Blanche of Lancaster died on **September 12, 1368**. The cause is widely believed to have been the plague.\n\n**Step 2: Determine where the event took place.**\n*   Blanche of Lancaster died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, which is located in **England**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Geoffrey Chaucer's life and career around 1368.**\n*   **Royal Service:** By 1367, Geoffrey Chaucer was a member of the royal household of King Edward III, serving as an esquire (*valettus*). This position was based in England, and he received a life annuity (a pension) for his service.\n*   **Travels:** Chaucer was known to travel abroad on diplomatic and military missions for the king. There is a record of him being sent \"on the king's service\" sometime during the summer of 1368 (between June and September). The exact destination is not specified, but such missions were often to France or the Low Countries.\n*   **The Key Connection:** The most significant piece of evidence linking Chaucer to this event is the poem he wrote afterward. John of Gaunt, Blanche's grieving husband, commissioned Chaucer to write an elegy in her memory. This poem is *The Book of the Duchess*, his first major work, likely completed between late 1368 and 1370.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the evidence to determine Chaucer's most probable location.**\n*   The fact that Chaucer was a member of the English royal court and was receiving a pension strongly places his primary base of operations in England.\n*   While he may have been on a short trip to the continent during the summer of 1368, the commission for *The Book of the Duchess* from John of Gaunt makes it extremely probable that he was in England at the time of Blanche's death or returned very shortly thereafter. It is highly unlikely that such a personal and significant commission would have been given to someone who was absent for a prolonged period.\n*   His famous travels to Italy did not occur until 1372-73, so he was not in Italy. There is no evidence he was in Scotland.\n*   Therefore, weighing the evidence of his official position in the English court and the subsequent commission of the poem against the possibility of a brief trip abroad, the most logical and widely accepted conclusion is that Chaucer was in England.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the answer choices.**\n*   A. Italy: Incorrect. Chaucer's first journey to Italy was in 1372.\n*   B. France: Possible that he was there during the summer, but less likely that he was there in mid-September when Blanche died, given the circumstances.\n*   C. England: Most probable. This was his home, the base of his employment, and where he was commissioned to write the elegy for Blanche shortly after her death.\n*   D. Unknown: While there is a slight degree of uncertainty, the evidence points so strongly to England that this is not the best answer.\n*   E. Scotland: Incorrect. No evidence supports this.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The overwhelming evidence points to Chaucer being in England when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<C>>>"
