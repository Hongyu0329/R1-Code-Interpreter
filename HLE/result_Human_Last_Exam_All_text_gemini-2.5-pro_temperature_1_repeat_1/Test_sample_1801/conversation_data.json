    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for two specific individuals who meet several criteria:\n    *   They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n    *   The commercial was from the year 2000.\n    *   The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why.\"\n    *   The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" alluding to Enron's spectacular collapse due to massive accounting fraud shortly after the campaign ran.\n\n2.  **Identify the Advertising Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a real, high-profile advertising effort by Enron in 2000. It was created by the agency Ogilvy & Mather. The goal was to rebrand Enron from a simple energy company into a sophisticated, innovative global marketplace for various commodities and services. The commercials were abstract and intellectual, designed to portray Enron as a company of big ideas.\n\n3.  **Identify the Featured Individuals:** The campaign featured several prominent figures to lend it intellectual credibility. By searching for the participants of the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial series, we can find the names of the experts who appeared. The two most frequently cited economists are **Paul Krugman** and **Myron Scholes**.\n\n4.  **Verify Nobel Laureate Status:** The next step is to confirm that both individuals are, in fact, Nobel laureates.\n    *   **Myron Scholes:** He, along with Robert C. Merton, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997** for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the Black-Scholes model). Therefore, he was already a Nobel laureate when the commercial aired in 2000.\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. Therefore, he was a prominent economist at the time of the commercial but had not yet received his Nobel Prize. He is, however, a Nobel laureate today.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Answer:** Both Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman were featured in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials. Both are Nobel laureates, fulfilling the main criteria of the question, even though one received the award after the commercial aired.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Timing of the Nobel Prize:** A key nuance is that only one of the two, Myron Scholes, was a Nobel laureate *at the time* the commercial was made. Paul Krugman became one eight years later. However, the question asks who \"were featured,\" and both individuals are now laureates, making them the correct answer.\n2.  **The Infamy of the Commercial:** The commercial is infamous due to the deep irony. Enron was encouraging the public to question everything and think deeply (\"Ask Why\"), while its own business was a house of cards built on complex, deceptive, and fraudulent accounting that could not withstand scrutiny. The company collapsed in scandal in late 2001.\n3.  **Other Participants:** While Krugman and Scholes are the Nobel laureates, it's worth noting other public figures like the architect Frank Gehry also appeared in the campaign. The question specifically focuses on the laureates.\n\nBy following these steps and considering these points, we can confidently identify the two individuals.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
