    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Principles of Coiled-Coil Structure**\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices wrap around each other to form a supercoil. Their structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Knobs-into-Holes Packing:** The stability of the coiled-coil comes from the hydrophobic effect and the efficient packing of amino acid side chains. Residues at the `a` and `d` positions of the heptad repeat are typically hydrophobic. They form the core of the structure, where the side chain of one helix (the \"knob\") packs into a cavity (the \"hole\") formed by side chains on the adjacent helix.\n*   **Oligomeric State Determination:** The specific identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is the primary determinant of how many helices will pack together (i.e., the oligomeric state). The shape of the side chains (e.g., branching at the β-carbon like Isoleucine/Valine vs. branching at the γ-carbon like Leucine) dictates the most efficient packing geometry.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Sequence**\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe must find the correct `(abcdefg)` phasing that places hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` core positions. Let's test different starting points for the repeat.\n\n*   If we start the first heptad at `G(a)`, then the `a` positions would be `G, K, K, K`, and the `d` positions would be `A, A, A, A`. Lysine (K) is charged and hydrophilic, so it cannot be in the hydrophobic core. This phasing is incorrect.\n\n*   Let's look for a consistent pattern of large hydrophobic residues. The sequence has a recurring `...L..I...` pattern. Let's try phasing where Leucine (L) is at the `a` position and Isoleucine (I) is at the `d` position (`a b c d`). This would look like `L x x I`.\n    *   Let's test this. Starting with the first `L` at position 7 as `a`:\n        *   `a(1)` = `L` (pos 7)\n        *   `b(1)` = `K` (pos 8)\n        *   `c(1)` = `E` (pos 9)\n        *   `d(1)` = `I` (pos 10)\n    *   This works. Let's continue the pattern for the whole sequence:\n        *   `g(1)` = `S` (pos 13) -> `a(2)` = `L` (pos 14). **This matches the sequence.**\n        *   `d(2)` = `I` (pos 17). **This matches the sequence.**\n        *   `g(2)` = `S` (pos 20) -> `a(3)` = `L` (pos 21). **This matches the sequence.**\n        *   `d(3)` = `I` (pos 24). **This matches the sequence.**\n        *   `g(3)` = `S` (pos 27) -> `a(4)` = `L` (pos 28). **This matches the sequence.**\n\nThis phasing is consistent throughout the entire core-forming region of the peptide.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Core Residue Composition**\nBased on the correct phasing identified in Step 2, the core positions are:\n*   **`a` positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n*   **`d` positions:** Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I)\n*   **Note on other residues:** The large hydrophobic Tryptophan (W) is at position 19. In our correct phasing, this corresponds to an `f` position (`...e(A) f(W) g(S)...`). The `f` position is solvent-exposed and not part of the hydrophobic core, so it does not directly influence the core packing geometry.\n\nThe definitive core pattern is **`a=L` and `d=I`**.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Packing Rules to Determine Oligomeric State**\nThe packing efficiency of different `a` and `d` residue combinations determines the preferred oligomeric state. The established rules are:\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Strongly favored by the combination of a non-β-branched residue at `a` (like **Leucine**) and a β-branched residue at `d` (like **Isoleucine**). The `a=L, d=I` pattern allows for optimal \"perpendicular\" knobs-into-holes packing.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Strongly favored by the opposite pattern: a β-branched residue at `a` (like **Isoleucine**) and a non-β-branched residue at `d` (like **Leucine**). The `a=I, d=L` pattern fits the \"parallel\" packing of a trimer core.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored when the `a` and `d` positions contain identical residues, such as `a=L, d=L` or `a=I, d=I`.\n\nThe sequence has a consistent **`a=L` and `d=I`** pattern. According to the principles of knobs-into-holes packing, this combination is the classic signature for a **dimeric (2-helix) coiled-coil**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the heptad repeat reveals a consistent hydrophobic core with Leucine at all `a` positions and Isoleucine at all `d` positions. This specific `a=L, d=I` arrangement is known to create the most efficient packing for a two-stranded coiled-coil. Therefore, the oligomeric state would be 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
