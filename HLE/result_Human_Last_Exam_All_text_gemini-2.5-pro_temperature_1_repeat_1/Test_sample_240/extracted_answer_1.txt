The most significant reason a functional MRI coil does not show resonance when probed is that it is in its default, safety-decoupled state. To prevent damage from the high-power transmit pulse, receive coils have built-in circuits (e.g., using PIN diodes) that actively detune them. Without the specific DC bias or control signals from the MRI scanner to switch it into "receive" mode, the coil remains intentionally non-resonant. Your measurement is therefore correctly showing the coil in its inactive, protected state.
