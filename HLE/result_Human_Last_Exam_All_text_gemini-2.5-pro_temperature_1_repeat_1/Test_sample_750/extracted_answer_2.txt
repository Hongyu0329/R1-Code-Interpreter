The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for $k \in \{-1, -2, -3, \dots\}$ where $y_k$ is the unique solution to $-y = \exp(-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi))$. There is also an infinite set of complex solutions with non-zero real and imaginary parts, which can be expressed along with all other solutions by the formula $z_{k,n} = i \frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$ where $C_k = (2k+\frac{1}{2})\pi$ and $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function, for all integers $k, n$.
