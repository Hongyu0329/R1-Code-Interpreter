    "Answering this question requires a careful handling of complex exponentiation and logarithms.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Equation**\n\nThe equation to solve is $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe term $i^z$ is a multi-valued complex exponentiation. For a complex base $a$ and exponent $b$, $a^b$ is defined as $e^{b \\ln(a)}$, where $\\ln(a)$ is the multi-valued complex logarithm.\n\n**2. Defining the Multi-valued Logarithm**\n\nThe logarithm of a complex number $w$ is given by:\n$\\ln(w) = \\text{Log}|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$\nwhere $\\text{Log}$ is the natural logarithm for real numbers, $\\arg(w)$ is the principal argument of $w$ (usually in $(-\\pi, \\pi]$), and $k$ is any integer ($k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\n\nFor our base, $a=i$:\n*   $|i| = 1$, so $\\text{Log}|i| = \\text{Log}(1) = 0$.\n*   $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nSo, the multi-valued logarithm of $i$ is:\n$\\ln(i) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(2k + \\frac{1}{2})\\pi$.\n\nLet's define $C_k = (2k + \\frac{1}{2})\\pi$ for convenience. Then $\\ln(i) = iC_k$.\nThe equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot \\ln(i)}$, which is $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot iC_k}$ for any integer $k$.\n\n**3. Setting up Equations in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*   **Left Hand Side (LHS):**\n    $z \\cdot i = (x + yi)i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$.\n\n*   **Right Hand Side (RHS):**\n    $i^z = e^{(x+yi)iC_k} = e^{xiC_k + y i^2 C_k} = e^{-yC_k + i xC_k}$\n    Using Euler's formula, $e^{a+bi} = e^a(\\cos(b) + i\\sin(b))$:\n    $i^z = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts of LHS = RHS:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\nThis system of two equations for variables $x$ and $y$ must be solved for each integer value of $k$.\n\n**4. Solving the System of Equations**\n\nWe can analyze different cases for $z$.\n\n**Case 1: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $0 = e^0 \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n2.  $x = e^0 \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom $\\cos(xC_k)=0$, we know that $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi = (n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n$x = \\sin((n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi)$.\nThe sine term evaluates to $1$ if $n$ is even, and $-1$ if $n$ is odd. So $x = (-1)^n$.\n\n*   If $x=1$ (for $n$ even):\n    Substitute $x=1$ into $xC_k = (n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$:\n    $C_k = (n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$.\n    Since $n$ is even, let $n=2j$. Then $C_k = (2j+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi = C_j$. This means $k=j$.\n    For any integer $k$, we can choose $n=2k$, and the equations are satisfied.\n    So, $z=1$ is a solution. Let's verify directly: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$. This is correct.\n\n*   If $x=-1$ (for $n$ odd):\n    Substitute $x=-1$ into $xC_k = (n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$:\n    $-C_k = (n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$.\n    $-(2k+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi = (n+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$.\n    Let $n=2j+1$. Then $-(2k+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi = (2j+1+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi = (2j+\\frac{3}{2})\\pi$.\n    $-2k-\\frac{1}{2} = 2j+\\frac{3}{2} \\implies -2k-2 = 2j \\implies j = -k-1$.\n    For any integer $k$, we can find an integer $n$ that satisfies the condition.\n    So, $z=-1$ is a solution. Let's verify directly: $-1 \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. This is also correct.\n\n**Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n2.  $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$. This gives no information.\n\nWe need to solve the equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nLet's analyze the function $h(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$. We are looking for its roots.\n\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = (2k+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi > 0$. The function $h(y)$ has a global minimum. The minimum value is $\\frac{1+\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$. Since $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1/e$, this minimum is always positive. Thus, there are no real solutions for $y$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k < 0$. The derivative $h'(y) = 1-C_ke^{-yC_k}$ is always positive. The function $h(y)$ is strictly increasing from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. Therefore, there is exactly one real root $y_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$. We can also show that this root $y_k$ must be negative.\n    These solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function, but identifying them as the unique solutions to this equation is sufficient.\n    So, for each integer $k \\in \\{-1, -2, -3, \\dots\\}$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k$.\n\n**Case 3: Other complex solutions ($x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$)**\nFor each integer $k \\ge 0$, there exists an infinite number of complex solutions. This can be shown most elegantly by transforming the original equation.\nThe equation $z \\cdot i = e^{ziC_k}$ can be rewritten as $z e^{-ziC_k} = -i$.\nLet $V = -ziC_k$. Then $z = iV/C_k$. Substituting this in:\n$(iV/C_k)e^V = -i \\implies (V/C_k)e^V = -1 \\implies Ve^V = -C_k$.\nThis is the defining equation for the Lambert W function, so $V = W_n(-C_k)$, where $n$ is an integer representing the branch of the function.\nSubstituting back for $z$:\n$-ziC_k = W_n(-C_k) \\implies z = \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{-iC_k} = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n\nThis formula generates all solutions, including the real and purely imaginary ones found earlier. For $k \\ge 0$, the argument $-C_k$ is less than $-1/e$, meaning $W_n(-C_k)$ is always a non-real complex number for any branch $n$. These correspond to the solutions with $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$ (except for the specific branches that give $z=1$ and $z=-1$).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ can be described in the following categories:\n\n1.  **Real Solutions:** There are two real solutions:\n    *   $z = 1$\n    *   $z = -1$\n\n2.  **Purely Imaginary Solutions:** There is an infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions, one for each negative integer $k \\in \\{-1, -2, -3, \\dots\\}$. Each solution $z_k = iy_k$ is given by the unique real number $y_k$ that satisfies the equation:\n    $-y = \\exp\\left(-y \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$\n\n3.  **Other Complex Solutions:** There is an infinite set of complex solutions with non-zero real and imaginary parts. These solutions exist for each non-negative integer $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$ and for each branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nThe entire set of solutions can be concisely expressed using the Lambert W function as:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n\\left(-\\left(2k+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi\\right)}{\\left(2k+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi}$\nfor all integers $k$ and $n$.\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for $k \\in \\{-1, -2, -3, \\dots\\}$ where $y_k$ is the unique solution to $-y = \\exp(-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$. There is also an infinite set of complex solutions with non-zero real and imaginary parts, which can be expressed along with all other solutions by the formula $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$ where $C_k = (2k+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$ and $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function, for all integers $k, n$.>>>"
