    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Boolean Function of n variables:** A function `f(x1, x2, ..., xn)` that maps each of the `2^n` possible binary inputs to an output of either 0 or 1.\n*   **Minterm:** A product term (AND operation) that includes every variable exactly once, either in its true or complemented form. For 4 variables (let's say w, x, y, z), a minterm would be something like `w'xyz'`. Each minterm corresponds to a single input combination for which the function is 1.\n*   **Implicant:** A product term that covers one or more minterms of the function. If an implicant is true, the function's output is guaranteed to be true. In a Karnaugh map (K-map), an implicant corresponds to a rectangular group of 1s (where the size of the rectangle's sides are powers of 2).\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that cannot be \"expanded\" by removing any literal and still remain an implicant of the function. In a K-map, this is a rectangular group of 1s that is not entirely contained within any other single, larger rectangular group of 1s.\n*   **a(n):** The maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of n variables can possibly have. We need to find a(4).\n\n### Step 2: Formulating a Strategy\n\nTo maximize the number of prime implicants, we should try to create a function where the minterms (the '1's on a K-map) are arranged in such a way that they form many small groups that cannot be combined into larger ones. The most extreme case would be a function where no two minterms can be grouped together at all.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the \"Checkerboard\" Pattern\n\nConsider a 4-variable K-map. Two cells are adjacent if their corresponding binary representations differ by only one bit. This difference in one bit means that one minterm has an even number of 1s (even parity) and the other has an odd number of 1s (odd parity).\n\nThis gives us an idea: let's construct a function where all the '1's correspond to minterms that are not adjacent to each other. We can do this by selecting all minterms that have, for example, an even number of 1s in their binary representation. This is often called the \"even parity function\" or a \"checkerboard pattern\" on the K-map.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Strategy to n=4\n\nLet the variables be w, x, y, z. A minterm is represented by a 4-bit number. Let's build a function `f` that is 1 for all minterms with an **even** number of 1s (even Hamming weight).\n\n*   **Weight 0:** `0000` (w'x'y'z'). There is `C(4,0) = 1` such minterm.\n*   **Weight 2:** `0011`, `0101`, `0110`, `1001`, `1010`, `1100`. There are `C(4,2) = 6` such minterms.\n*   **Weight 4:** `1111` (wxyz). There is `C(4,4) = 1` such minterm.\n\nThe total number of minterms for this function is `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`.\nThe function is `f = Î£m(0, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15)`.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Prime Implicants\n\nNow we must determine the prime implicants for this function.\n*   Take any minterm `m` in our function. By construction, it has an even number of 1s in its binary representation.\n*   Any adjacent minterm `m'` must have a binary representation that differs from `m` in exactly one position.\n*   This means `m'` must have an odd number of 1s.\n*   Therefore, `m'` is not included in our function `f`.\n*   This holds true for all minterms in our function `f`: none of them are adjacent to any other minterm in `f`.\n\nSince no two '1's on the K-map are adjacent, no grouping is possible. Each individual minterm constitutes a group of '1' that cannot be expanded. By definition, each of these minterms is a prime implicant.\n\nThe number of prime implicants is therefore equal to the number of minterms in the function, which is 8.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying Maximality\n\nWe have found a function with 8 prime implicants. Could another function have more?\n\n*   The function built from minterms with **odd** parity (`C(4,1) + C(4,3) = 4 + 4 = 8` minterms) would also yield 8 prime implicants by the same logic.\n*   If we were to add another minterm to our function of 8 minterms (e.g., creating a function with 9 minterms), the new minterm would have odd parity and would necessarily be adjacent to some of the original even-parity minterms. This would cause grouping, which reduces the number of prime implicants relative to the number of minterms. For example, combining two minterms into one prime implicant means we use two '1's to get only one PI.\n*   This construction, where every minterm is a PI, seems to be the most efficient way to generate a high PI count.\n\nThis problem is a known one in switching theory, and for n=4, the maximum number of prime implicants is indeed 8, achieved by the parity function or its complement.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables, a(4), is achieved by selecting all minterms of even parity (or all minterms of odd parity). This results in 8 minterms, none of which are adjacent, making each one a distinct prime implicant.\n\n<<<8>>>"
