    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Central Query:** What is the specific name for the value measured *between* individual heartbeats that is used to compute HRV?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Concepts:**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR):** This is the average number of heartbeats in a given time period, usually expressed in beats per minute (BPM). It gives a general sense of the heart's speed.\n    *   **Beat-to-Beat Interval:** This is the precise amount of time that elapses between two consecutive heartbeats. For example, if the time between one beat and the next is 0.8 seconds, and the time between the next two is 0.85 seconds, these are two different beat-to-beat intervals.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is not a single value but a collection of metrics that quantify the *variation* in the beat-to-beat intervals. High variability (a larger difference in the time between successive beats) is generally a sign of a healthy, adaptable autonomic nervous system.\n    *   **PPG vs. ECG:** The gold standard for measuring the heart's electrical activity is an electrocardiogram (ECG). On an ECG, the most prominent spike is called the \"R-wave\". The time between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**. PPG, on the other hand, measures blood volume changes in the tissue. The time between the peaks of the pulse waves measured by PPG is called the Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI) or Peak-to-Peak (PP) interval.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Concepts to the Question:**\n    *   The question states that HRV is computed from the \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   While PPG technically measures IPI, in the context of HRV analysis, this measurement is used as a surrogate for the ECG-derived **R-R interval**.\n    *   The term **R-R interval** has become the standard and most widely recognized term in scientific and clinical literature for the time between consecutive heartbeats, regardless of whether the source is an ECG or PPG.\n    *   Therefore, the value computed between heartbeats is the time duration of that interval, which is called the R-R interval. Other correct, but less common or more specific terms include Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) or Normal-to-Normal (NN) Interval (which refers to R-R intervals that have been filtered to remove abnormal beats).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Terminology Specificity:** While \"Inter-Beat Interval\" (IBI) is a general and correct term, **\"R-R interval\"** is the specific, standard term used in the field of HRV.\n*   **Measurement Source:** Be aware that the term \"R-R interval\" originated from ECGs but is now commonly used for PPG-derived data as well, as PPG is used to estimate the same physiological event.\n*   **Distinction from HRV Metrics:** The question is asking for the raw input value (the time interval), not the final HRV calculation (like SDNN or RMSSD), which are statistical measures *of* these intervals.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the value representing the time between consecutive heartbeats, which is the fundamental data point for calculating HRV, is most commonly and standardly referred to as the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
