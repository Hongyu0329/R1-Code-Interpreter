    "To determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length \\(n=333\\) that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions.\n\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be a permutation in \\(S_n\\). The number of inversions, denoted `inv(\\(\\pi\\))`, is the number of pairs of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)\\). A permutation \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\pi(i) < \\pi(k) < \\pi(j) < \\pi(l)\\).\n\nWe can classify permutations by the structure of their inversions. The number of inversions of a permutation can be calculated from its Lehmer code. The Lehmer code of a permutation \\(\\pi\\) is a sequence \\(L(\\pi) = (L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_n)\\) where \\(L_i\\) is the number of elements to the right of \\(\\pi_i\\) that are smaller than \\(\\pi_i\\). The number of inversions is the sum of the entries in the Lehmer code: `inv(\\(\\pi\\)) = \\sum_{i=1}^n L_i`.\n\nFor a permutation to have 3 inversions, the sum of the entries in its Lehmer code must be 3. The possible non-negative integer partitions of 3 are:\n1. 3\n2. 2 + 1\n3. 1 + 1 + 1\n\nThis corresponds to the following possibilities for the non-zero entries in the Lehmer code:\nCase 1: One entry is 3. \\(L_i = 3\\) for some \\(i\\), and \\(L_j = 0\\) for \\(j \\neq i\\).\nCase 2: One entry is 2, another is 1. \\(L_i = 2, L_j = 1\\) for some \\(i \\neq j\\), and other entries are 0.\nCase 3: Three entries are 1. \\(L_i = 1, L_j = 1, L_k = 1\\) for some distinct \\(i, j, k\\), and other entries are 0.\n\nFor a large \\(n\\) like 333, a permutation constructed from a Lehmer code with non-zero entries at \"distant\" positions will likely contain a 1324 pattern. The pattern \\(\\pi(p_1) < \\pi(p_3) < \\pi(p_2) < \\pi(p_4)\\) can often be formed by choosing the elements for \\(\\pi(p_2)\\) and \\(\\pi(p_3)\\) from the elements involved in the inversions, and \\(\\pi(p_1)\\) and \\(\\pi(p_4)\\) from the elements that are far from the inversions and are in their sorted positions.\n\nThe permutations that avoid the 1324 pattern are typically those where the disordered elements are \"localized\" at one end of the permutation. This corresponds to Lehmer codes where the non-zero entries are in a contiguous block at the beginning or at the end of the code. For \\(n=333\\), this is a safe assumption. We analyze the permutations that arise from these localized Lehmer codes.\n\nLet's analyze these cases based on the structure of the permutation. A permutation with a small number of inversions can be seen as a small local rearrangement of the identity permutation.\n\n1.  A single block of four elements is rearranged. The permutation is of the form \\(\\pi = (1, 2, \\dots, i-1) \\oplus \\sigma \\oplus (i+4, \\dots, n)\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{i, i+1, i+2, i+3\\}\\) with 3 inversions. The permutations in \\(S_4\\) with 3 inversions are:\n    *   \\(\\sigma_A = 4123\\). This corresponds to \\(L=(3,0,0,0)\\). Let \\(\\pi_A(i)\\) be the permutation where this block starts at index \\(i\\). A 1324 pattern can be formed unless \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-3\\).\n        *   For \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots, n)\\). This permutation is 1324-avoiding.\n        *   For \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, n-4, n, n-3, n-2, n-1)\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n        These are 2 distinct permutations for \\(n=333\\).\n    *   \\(\\sigma_B = 2341\\). This corresponds to \\(L=(1,1,1,0)\\). Let \\(\\pi_B(i)\\) be the permutation. It avoids 1324 if \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-3\\).\n        *   For \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (2, 3, 4, 1, 5, \\dots, n)\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n        *   For \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, n-4, n-2, n-1, n, n-3)\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n        These are 2 distinct permutations for \\(n=333\\).\n    *   Other permutations of \\(S_4\\) with 3 inversions, like \\(2413\\), when placed as a block inside the identity permutation, create a 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\), even at the ends. For instance, \\((2,4,1,3,5,\\dots,n)\\) contains the pattern \\(2,4,3,5\\) (using values \\(\\pi(1)=2, \\pi(2)=4, \\pi(4)=3, \\pi(5)=5\\)).\n\n2.  A single block of three elements is rearranged. The permutation is of the form \\(\\pi = (1, 2, \\dots, i-1) \\oplus \\sigma \\oplus (i+3, \\dots, n)\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{i, i+1, i+2\\}\\) with 3 inversions. The only permutation in \\(S_3\\) with 3 inversions is \\(\\sigma_C = 321\\), corresponding to \\(L=(2,1,0)\\). Let \\(\\pi_C(i)\\) be the permutation where this block starts at index \\(i\\). It avoids 1324 if \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-2\\).\n    *   For \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (3, 2, 1, 4, \\dots, n)\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n    *   For \\(i=n-2\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n    These are 2 distinct permutations for \\(n=333\\).\n\nIn summary, we have found 6 types of permutations that avoid the 1324 pattern and have 3 inversions. For \\(n=333\\), these 6 permutations are distinct.\n\nThe 6 permutations are:\n1.  \\((4, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\ldots, 333)\\)\n2.  \\((1, 2, \\ldots, 329, 333, 330, 331, 332)\\)\n3.  \\((2, 3, 4, 1, 5, \\ldots, 333)\\)\n4.  \\((1, 2, \\ldots, 329, 331, 332, 333, 330)\\)\n5.  \\((3, 2, 1, 4, 5, \\ldots, 333)\\)\n6.  \\((1, 2, \\ldots, 330, 333, 332, 331)\\)\n\nAny other permutation with 3 inversions will involve either non-adjacent groups of inverted elements or a more complex single block of rearranged elements. For a large \\(n\\) like 333, these other permutations can be shown to contain the 1324 pattern. Therefore, the number of such permutations is 6.\n\nFinal count:\n*   From rearranging four elements: 2 + 2 = 4 permutations.\n*   From rearranging three elements: 2 permutations.\nTotal: 4 + 2 = 6 permutations.\n\nThe number \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is the number of such permutations.\n\nFinal Answer: 6.\n\n>>>6"
