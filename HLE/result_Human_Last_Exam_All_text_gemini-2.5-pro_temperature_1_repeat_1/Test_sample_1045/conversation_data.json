    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atom count.**\nThe molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). A CGF is a fixed linear combination of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). We need to determine the number of CGFs for each type of atom.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the basis functions for a Carbon (C) atom.**\nCarbon is a \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atom. The notation 6-31G is applied as follows:\n*   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The '6' indicates that the core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF). This CGF is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   Number of CGFs for the core = 1\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz):** The valence shell is \"split\" into two sets of basis functions, an inner and an outer part. This is represented by the '31' part of the notation.\n    *   **Inner Valence:** The '3' indicates that the inner part of the valence shell is described by one set of CGFs (one for the 2s orbital and one set for the 2p orbitals). Each of these CGFs is formed from 3 PGFs.\n        *   1 CGF for the 2s orbital.\n        *   3 CGFs for the 2p orbitals (one each for 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        *   Total CGFs for inner valence = 1 + 3 = 4\n    *   **Outer Valence:** The '1' indicates that the outer part of the valence shell is described by another set of CGFs. Each of these is a single, uncontracted PGF.\n        *   1 CGF for the 2s orbital.\n        *   3 CGFs for the 2p orbitals (one each for 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        *   Total CGFs for outer valence = 1 + 3 = 4\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:**\n    *   Total CGFs = (Core CGFs) + (Inner Valence CGFs) + (Outer Valence CGFs)\n    *   Total CGFs per C = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the basis functions for a Hydrogen (H) atom.**\nHydrogen has no core electrons. The notation for hydrogen in a 6-31G calculation is effectively 3-1G.\n*   **Core Orbitals:** None.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (1s):** The 1s valence orbital is split into two parts.\n    *   **Inner Valence:** The '3' indicates the inner part is described by 1 CGF (contracted from 3 PGFs).\n    *   **Outer Valence:** The '1' indicates the outer part is described by 1 CGF (which is a single PGF).\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Total CGFs per H = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8).**\nNow, we multiply the number of CGFs per atom by the number of atoms of that type in the molecule and sum the results.\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/C atom = 63 CGFs\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/H atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total number of CGFs:**\n    *   Total = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguish CGFs from PGFs:** The question asks for contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), not primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). The numbers in the basis set name (6, 3, 1) refer to the number of PGFs used to build the CGFs.\n*   **Basis Set Application:** The full `X-YZG` notation applies to heavy atoms. Hydrogen, having no core electrons, only uses the `YZG` part.\n*   **p-orbitals:** Remember that a \"p-shell\" basis function set consists of three individual functions (px, py, pz).\n*   **Atom Count:** Ensure the number of atoms for each element in the molecule (C7H8) is correct.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
