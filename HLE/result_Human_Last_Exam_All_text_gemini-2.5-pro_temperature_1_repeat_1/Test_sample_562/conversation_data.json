    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Character**\nThe character 謄 can be visually broken down into two main components:\n*   The left part: 言\n*   The right part: 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese kanji, the radical (部首, bushu) is the component that classifies the character and often gives a hint about its meaning.\n*   The left component, 言, means \"words,\" \"to say,\" or \"speech.\"\n*   The right component, 朕, is a character that acts as the phonetic component here.\n*   The overall meaning of 謄 is \"copy\" or \"transcript,\" which is strongly related to the concept of \"words.\" Therefore, the semantic component and the radical of the character is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nRadicals have specific names, and these names can change depending on their position within a character.\n*   The radical 言 is known as ごん (gon) or ことば (kotoba).\n*   When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   The specific name for the 言 radical when it is positioned on the left is ごんべん (gonben).\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the radical's name, ごんべん, using the standard Hepburn transcription system.\n*   ごんべん is romanized as \"gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Radical vs. Phonetic:** It's important to correctly identify the radical, which relates to meaning, as distinct from the phonetic component, which relates to sound.\n*   **Positional Names:** Remember that radicals have specific names based on their position (e.g., -hen for left, -tsukuri for right, -kanmuri for top).\n*   **Accurate Romanization:** Ensure the transcription follows the Hepburn system correctly.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
