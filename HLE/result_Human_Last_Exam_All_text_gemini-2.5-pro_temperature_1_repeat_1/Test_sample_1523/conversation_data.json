    "This problem requires an understanding of the functional integral formalism in finite-temperature quantum field theory, specifically for a neutral scalar field. We will break down the problem to identify each component and then assemble the final expression.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Set up the theoretical framework.**\n\n*   **Finite-Temperature Field Theory:** We work in the imaginary time (or Matsubara) formalism. Time is treated as a complex variable, and the path integral is performed along the imaginary axis from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=\\beta$, where $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B=1$). Spacetime is Euclidean, $x_E = (\\tau, \\vec{x})$.\n*   **Neutral Scalar Field:** For a bosonic field like a neutral scalar, the field configurations $\\phi(x_E)$ must be periodic in imaginary time with period $\\beta$: $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\vec{x})$.\n*   **Functional Integral:** The partition function $Z$ is given by a functional integral over all possible field configurations that satisfy the periodicity condition:\n    $Z = \\int [d\\phi] \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n*   **Euclidean Action ($S_E$):** The Euclidean action for a neutral scalar field with mass $m$ and a potential term $V(\\phi)$ is:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E(\\phi, \\partial_\\mu \\phi)$\n    where the Euclidean Lagrangian density is:\n    $\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 + V(\\phi)$\n    The term $(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2$ is the Euclidean version of $(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial^\\mu \\phi)$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components of the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$.**\n\nThe notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ refers to an inner product involving the field $\\phi$ and the result of an operator $D$ acting on $\\phi$. This structure arises naturally from the quadratic part of the action, which forms the basis for perturbation theory.\n\n*   **The Field $\\phi$**: This is the integration variable in the functional integral, representing a specific field configuration $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$.\n*   **The Inner Product $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$**: In the context of a functional integral over spacetime, the inner product of two real functions $f(x_E)$ and $g(x_E)$ is defined by the integral of their product over the entire spacetime volume:\n    $(f, g) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, f(\\tau, \\vec{x}) g(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n*   **The Operator $D$**: To identify the operator $D$, we analyze the free part of the action (i.e., we set $V(\\phi)=0$). The free action, $S_{E,0}$, contains all terms quadratic in $\\phi$.\n    $S_{E,0}[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n    We use integration by parts on the derivative terms. For example, $\\int d\\tau \\, (\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 = \\int d\\tau \\, \\phi(-\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi)$, where the boundary term vanishes due to the periodicity of $\\phi$. A similar manipulation applies to the spatial part, assuming fields vanish at spatial infinity. This allows us to rewrite the action as:\n    $S_{E,0}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left[ -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n    This expression is in the form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$. Therefore, the operator $D$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 = -\\Box_E + m^2$\n*   **The Term $D_\\phi$**: This is standard notation for the operator $D$ acting on the field $\\phi$, so $D_\\phi \\equiv D\\phi$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$.**\n\nUsing the definitions from Step 2, we can now write down the explicit expression for the inner product.\n\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = (\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) (D\\phi)(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nSubstituting the explicit form of the operator $D$:\n\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left[ -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nFrom our analysis in Step 2, we can see that this expression is exactly twice the free Euclidean action, $2S_{E,0}[\\phi]$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Euclidean vs. Minkowski:** It is crucial to use the Euclidean action and metric. In Minkowski space, the operator would be $\\Box + m^2 = \\partial_t^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$, leading to different signs.\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** The use of integration by parts to define the operator $D$ relies on the vanishing of boundary terms. For the imaginary time coordinate $\\tau$, this is ensured by the periodicity of the bosonic field. For the spatial coordinates, this is ensured by the physical assumption that fields vanish at infinity.\n3.  **Operator Definition:** The operator $D$ is fundamentally defined by the part of the action that is quadratic in the fields. This is why we can ignore the interaction potential $V(\\phi)$ for this question. The operator $D$ is the inverse of the free propagator.\n4.  **Notation:** The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is a compact way to represent the quadratic form that appears in the exponent of the Gaussian part of the functional integral.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe question asks for the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$. Based on the step-by-step analysis:\n1.  The inner product is defined as an integral over Euclidean spacetime.\n2.  The operator $D$ is identified from the quadratic part of the Euclidean action as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$.\n3.  The expression $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is the inner product of the field $\\phi$ with $D\\phi$.\n\nThis leads to the final expression.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ in the functional integral representation is given by the expression:\n$$\n(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left[ -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})\n$$\nwhere $\\beta=1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field, $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$ is a configuration of the field, and $-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. This expression is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_{E,0}[\\phi]$.>>>"
