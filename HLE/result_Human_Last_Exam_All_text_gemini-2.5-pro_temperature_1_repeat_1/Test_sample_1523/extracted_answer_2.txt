The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ in the functional integral representation is given by the expression:
$$
(\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^{\beta} d\tau \int d^3x \, \phi(\tau, \vec{x}) \left[ -\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2 \right] \phi(\tau, \vec{x})
$$
where $\beta=1/T$ is the inverse temperature, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field, $\phi(\tau, \vec{x})$ is a configuration of the field, and $-\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. This expression is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_{E,0}[\phi]$.
