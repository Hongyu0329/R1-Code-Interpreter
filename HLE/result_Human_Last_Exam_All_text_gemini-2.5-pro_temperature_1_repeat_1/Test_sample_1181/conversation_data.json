    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific character from the 1972 film *Solaris*, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The identifying detail is a very specific line of dialogue or sentiment: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and Their Motivations**\nLet's consider each character provided in the answer choices in the context of the film's themes of memory, humanity, and nostalgia.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. His journey is defined by his deep connection to Earth, his past, and his wife, Hari. He is overtly nostalgic, especially for his family home (the dacha) which is shown at the beginning and end of the film. While he certainly misses Earth, the emotion he displays is more profound longing and grief rather than shame about it.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories of his deceased wife, created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. She has no independent memories of Earth herself; her understanding of it is filtered entirely through Kris. Therefore, she could not miss something she has never experienced.\n*   **C. Snaut:** A cyberneticist and one of the two surviving crew members Kris finds on the station. He is cynical, weary, and philosophical. He often acts as a commentator on the human condition and the futility of their scientific mission so far from home. This personality is a prime candidate for having a complex, self-aware feeling like being ashamed of a simple, human longing.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** A biologist, the other surviving crew member. He is portrayed as cold, detached, and ruthlessly scientific. He is contemptuous of the emotional turmoil on the station and sees the \"guests\" as mere objects of study. It is highly uncharacteristic for him to admit to any form of emotional weakness or nostalgia, let alone express shame over it.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A friend of Kris who was the head of the station's scientific team. He commits suicide just before Kris arrives. We see him only in a recorded video message and as a \"guest\" in Kris's dream. His messages convey despair and warning, not a specific, wistful nostalgia.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThe line in question is part of a longer, philosophical monologue. In a key scene, Snaut is talking to Kris about humanity's true purpose in space exploration. He says (paraphrasing from the English dub/subtitles):\n\n\"We don't want other worlds. We want a mirror... Man needs man... In my opinion, we are in a stupid situation... Sometimes I am ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling.\"\n\nThis line perfectly captures Snaut's character: a scientist who has come to see the limits of science and feels a profound, almost embarrassing, nostalgia for the simple, terrestrial experiences they have lost. He is ashamed because this feeling contradicts his role as a dispassionate explorer of the cosmos.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the direct dialogue from the film, the character who expresses shame over missing the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. The other characters' personalities and roles in the story do not align with this specific sentiment.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Source Material:** The question specifically refers to the **1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie**, not the original novel by Stanislaw Lem or the 2002 remake by Steven Soderbergh. Characterizations and specific lines of dialogue can differ significantly between these versions.\n2.  **The Emotion of \"Shame\":** The key is not just *missing* Earth, but being *ashamed* of it. Kris misses Earth openly. Sartorius would likely hide such a feeling. Snaut is the one who intellectualizes his own emotions, analyzing his nostalgia and labeling it with a sense of shame, as if it's a human weakness unbecoming of a pioneer in space.\n3.  **Translation:** As with any foreign film, exact wording can vary between subtitles and dubbed versions. However, the substance of Snaut's speech and this specific admission remains consistent across translations.\n\n<<<C>>>"
