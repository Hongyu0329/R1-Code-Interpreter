    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of the given graph \\( G \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph \\( G \\)\n\nThe problem defines the graph \\( G \\) as the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". In graph theory, the term \"sum\" most commonly refers to the **graph join** operation, denoted by '+'.\n\nLet \\( C_n^{(1)} \\), \\( C_n^{(2)} \\), and \\( C_n^{(3)} \\) be three vertex-disjoint cycles of length \\( n \\). The graph \\( G \\) is their join:\n\\( G = C_n^{(1)} + C_n^{(2)} + C_n^{(3)} \\)\n\nThe structure of the join \\( G_1 + G_2 \\) is formed by taking the disjoint union of the vertices and edges of \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), and then adding an edge between every vertex of \\( G_1 \\) and every vertex of \\( G_2 \\).\n\nSo, for our graph \\( G \\):\n*   The vertex set \\( V(G) \\) is the disjoint union of the vertex sets of the three cycles, \\( V(C_n^{(1)}) \\cup V(C_n^{(2)}) \\cup V(C_n^{(3)}) \\). The total number of vertices is \\( n + n + n = 3n \\).\n*   The edge set \\( E(G) \\) consists of:\n    1.  The edges within each of the three cycles.\n    2.  All possible edges connecting a vertex from \\( C_n^{(i)} \\) to a vertex from \\( C_n^{(j)} \\) for all \\( i \\neq j \\).\n\n### Step 2: Chromatic Number of a Graph Join\n\nA fundamental property of the graph join operation relates to the chromatic number. For any two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), the chromatic number of their join is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\n\\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\)\n\n**Justification:** In any proper coloring of \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), every vertex in \\( V(G_1) \\) is adjacent to every vertex in \\( V(G_2) \\). This means that the set of colors used for the vertices of \\( G_1 \\) must be completely disjoint from the set of colors used for the vertices of \\( G_2 \\). Therefore, the total number of colors required is at least \\( \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This lower bound can be achieved by finding an optimal coloring for \\( G_1 \\) and an optimal coloring for \\( G_2 \\) using two separate sets of colors.\n\nThis property extends to the join of more than two graphs. For our graph \\( G \\), we have:\n\\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n^{(1)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(2)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(3)}) \\)\n\nSince \\( C_n^{(1)} \\), \\( C_n^{(2)} \\), and \\( C_n^{(3)} \\) are all cycles of the same length \\( n \\), they have the same chromatic number, \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). Therefore:\n\\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\n### Step 3: Chromatic Number of a Cycle \\( C_n \\)\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on the parity of its length \\( n \\). We assume \\( n \\geq 3 \\), as a cycle must have at least 3 vertices.\n\n*   **Case 1: \\( n \\) is even** (\\( n = 4, 6, 8, \\dots \\))\n    An even cycle is a bipartite graph. Its vertices can be colored by alternating between two colors. Thus, its chromatic number is 2.\n    \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\) for even \\( n \\).\n\n*   **Case 2: \\( n \\) is odd** (\\( n = 3, 5, 7, \\dots \\))\n    An odd cycle is not bipartite, so it requires more than two colors. We can color \\( n-1 \\) vertices by alternating two colors. The \\( n \\)-th vertex will be adjacent to two vertices of different colors, so it requires a third color. Thus, its chromatic number is 3.\n    \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\) for odd \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Maximal Chromatic Number of \\( G \\)\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\). This means we can choose the value of \\( n \\) that maximizes \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\nFrom Step 2, we know \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\). To maximize \\( \\chi(G) \\), we must maximize \\( \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\nBased on Step 3, the possible values for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) are 2 and 3. The maximum value is 3, which is achieved when \\( n \\) is an odd integer.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is obtained when \\( n \\) is odd:\nMaximal \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot (\\text{maximal } \\chi(C_n)) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n\nFor example, if we choose \\( n=3 \\), the graph \\( G \\) is the join of three triangles (\\( C_3 \\)). Since \\( \\chi(C_3) = 3 \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\). If we choose \\( n=4 \\), the graph \\( G \\) is the join of three 4-cycles (\\( C_4 \\)). Since \\( \\chi(C_4) = 2 \\), \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\). The largest possible value is 9.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Sum\"**: The most crucial point is the interpretation of the \"sum of graphs\". The join operation is the standard interpretation in this context and leads to a well-defined answer. Other interpretations like disjoint union or union on the same vertex set would yield different, and generally lower, results.\n2.  **Cycle Length \\( n \\)**: A cycle requires \\( n \\geq 3 \\). This condition is met since we can choose any odd \\( n \\) such as 3, 5, etc., to achieve the maximum chromatic number.\n3.  **\"Maximal\"**: The question asks for the single highest possible value for the chromatic number, implying that we have the freedom to choose the parameter \\( n \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum (join) of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is achieved when \\( n \\) is odd, making the chromatic number of each cycle 3. The total chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the three components.\n\nMaximal \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_{\\text{odd}}) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\n<<<9>>>"
