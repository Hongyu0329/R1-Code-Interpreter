    "Here is a step-by-step scansion of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**1. Write out the line and identify syllables and elisions.**\n\nThe line is: `ve-rum u-bi e-qui at-que ho-mi-nis ca-su con-ve-nit i-ma-go.`\n\nWe must look for elisions, where a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word starting with a vowel or \"h-\".\n\n*   `verum ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` elides with the `u-` of `ubi`. The line scans as `ver' ubi`.\n*   `equi atque`: The `-i` of `equi` elides with the `a-` of `atque`. The line scans as `equ' atque`.\n*   `atque hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis` (h is ignored for scansion). The line scans as `atqu' hominis`.\n\n**2. Scan the line foot by foot.**\n\nA hexameter line has six feet. Each foot is either a dactyl (— ⏑ ⏑, one long syllable followed by two short ones) or a spondee (— —, two long syllables). The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n\n*   **Foot 1: `verum ubi`**\n    *   This becomes `ver' ubi`, which syllabifies to `ve-ru-bi`.\n    *   `ve-`: The `e` in `verum` is long by nature (`vērum`). So this is a **long** syllable (—).\n    *   `-ru-`: The `u` from `ubi` is short. This is a **short** syllable (⏑).\n    *   `-bi`: The `i` from `ubi` is short. This is a **short** syllable (⏑).\n    *   The foot is `— ⏑ ⏑`, which is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 6 (The end of the line): `imago`**\n    *   The last foot must be a spondee (or a trochee, but the final syllable is always treated as long). The last two syllables are `-ma-go`.\n    *   `ma`: The `a` in `imāgō` is long by nature. **Long** (—).\n    *   `go`: The final syllable is always scanned as long. **Long** (—).\n    *   The foot is `— —`, a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 5: `convenit`**\n    *   The fifth foot is expected to be a dactyl. Let's examine `convenit`.\n    *   `con-`: The `o` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`n` and `v`), making it long by position. **Long** (—).\n    *   `-ve-`: The `e` in `convenit` is short. **Short** (⏑).\n    *   `-nit`: The `i` in `convenit` is short. **Short** (⏑).\n    *   The foot is `— ⏑ ⏑`, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 4: `casu`**\n    *   This foot comes before `convenit`.\n    *   `ca-`: From `cāsū` (ablative), the `a` is long by nature. **Long** (—).\n    *   `-su`: From `cāsū`, the `u` is long by nature. **Long** (—).\n    *   The foot is `— —`, a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Feet 2 and 3: `equi atque hominis`**\n    *   This is a notoriously difficult part of the line that requires recognizing poetic licenses.\n    *   We have a chain of elisions: `equ(i a)tqu(e ho)minis`.\n    *   **Foot 2**: The foot must be `equi atque`. After elision (`equ'atque`), the syllables are `e-quat-que`. The `e` is short, so this cannot form a dactyl or a spondee normally. A license is used here where the short `e` is lengthened by the metrical stress (ictus), and the elided result `equat` is treated as two long syllables. Thus, `ēquāt` is taken as a spondee. **Spondee (S)**.\n    *   **Foot 3**: The remaining part is `hominis`. The syllables are `ho-mi-nis` (`⏑ ⏑ ⏑`), which is not a valid foot. Here, another license, synizesis (blending two syllables into one), is often invoked, treating `hominis` as `hom'nis`. The syllable `hom-` becomes long by position and `-nis` becomes long by position before the `c` of `casu`. This creates a spondee. **Spondee (S)**.\n\n**3. Final Result**\n\nCombining the feet, we get the following pattern:\n*   Foot 1: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 2: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 3: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 4: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 5: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 6: Spondee (S)\n\nThe final pattern is D S S S D S.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
