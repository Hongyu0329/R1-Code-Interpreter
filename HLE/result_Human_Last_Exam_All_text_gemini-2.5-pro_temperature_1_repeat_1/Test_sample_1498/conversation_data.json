    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and the Text**\n\nThe question asks for the specific range of verses (*abyat*, singular: *bayt*) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the names of the Prophets of Islam are listed. The poem, authored by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, is a foundational text in Islamic theology (*'aqidah*) that systematically outlines core beliefs. It follows a logical order: belief in Allah, then His Messengers, His Books, His Angels, the Last Day, and so on. We need to locate the section dedicated to enumerating the Prophets.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Beginning of the Section on Prophets**\n\nBefore the names are listed, the poem first introduces the topic of Prophets and the obligation to believe in them.\n*   The discussion on the attributes of Prophets (like truthfulness, trustworthiness, etc.) begins around verse 19.\n*   However, the question is specifically about the *names*.\n*   Verse 26 sets the stage for the list by stating the number of prophets whose names must be known in detail:\n    > تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n    > كُلُّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    >\n    > \"The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding,\n    > Upon every legally responsible person, so verify and seize [this knowledge].\"\n\nThis verse acts as an introduction to the list but does not contain any names itself. The actual enumeration begins in the very next verse.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Starting Verse of the List of Names**\n\nFollowing the introductory statement in verse 26, verse 27 begins the list of names explicitly:\n> هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n> صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n>\n> \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with\n> Salih and Ibrahim, each one is to be followed.\"\n\nTherefore, **bayt 27** is the starting point where the names are mentioned.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Ending Verse of the List of Names**\n\nWe must now follow the list through the subsequent verses until it concludes. The poem continues listing the names:\n*   **Verse 28:** Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf...\n*   **Verse 29:** Ayyub, Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa...\n*   **Verse 30:** Al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Da'ud, Sulayman...\n*   **Verse 31:** Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya...\n*   **Verse 32:** 'Isa...\n\nThe list culminates in the next verse, which mentions the final Prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him), and concludes the list.\n\n*   **Verse 33:**\n    > وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ عَنِ الْغَيِّ\n    > عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ\n    >\n    > \"And Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the Seal - so leave deviation.\n    > Upon them be peace and blessings.\"\n\nThis verse contains the last name in the list (\"Taha\" for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ) and explicitly refers to him as the \"Seal\" (*Khatim*), signifying the end. The following verse (34) then moves on to the topic of Angels, confirming that the list of Prophets' names has ended.\n\nTherefore, **bayt 33** is the ending point of the list.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Range**\n\nBased on the analysis, the list of the Prophets' names begins in verse 27 and ends in verse 33.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Distinction is Key:** It is important to distinguish between the start of the *topic* of Prophethood (which begins earlier) and the start of the *list of names* (which begins at verse 27). The question specifically asks for the names.\n2.  **The Preamble Verse:** Verse 26 is crucial as it sets up the list by stating the number of prophets (25) to be named, but it does not contain the names themselves.\n3.  **The Concluding Verse:** Verse 33 is the definitive end, as it contains the final Prophet's name and the concluding title \"Seal\" (*Khatim*).\n4.  **Verse Numbering:** The verse numbering used here (27-33) is standard in most editions of *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam*. Minor variations might exist, but the content of the verses provides the definitive start and end points.\n\n***\n\nThe names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam are mentioned from bayt (verse) 27 to bayt (verse) 33.\n\n<<<From bayt (verse) 27 to bayt (verse) 33>>>"
