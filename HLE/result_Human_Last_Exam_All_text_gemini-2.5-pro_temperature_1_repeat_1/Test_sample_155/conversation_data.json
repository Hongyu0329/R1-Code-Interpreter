    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to decode the word:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Encoding Scheme**\n\nThe puzzle uses the characters 't' and 'b' arranged in a specific layout. A simple visual inspection of the characters themselves doesn't immediately reveal letters. This suggests a more complex encoding scheme. The most plausible interpretation is that the shape of the characters 't' and 'b' is significant.\n\n*   The letter 't' has a crossbar at the **top**.\n*   The letter 'b' has a loop at the **bottom**.\n\nThis suggests a mapping where each character in the input corresponds to a pixel that is \"on\" in either the top or bottom half of its grid cell. This effectively doubles the vertical resolution of the image.\n\n*   `t` = A pixel in the **top** half of the cell.\n*   `b` = A pixel in the **bottom** half of the cell.\n*   ` ` (space) = An empty cell (no pixels).\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the Image**\n\nWe will now apply this rule to the input text, building a new image with twice the number of rows. Each line of text in the original input will generate two rows of pixels in the new image (a \"top\" row and a \"bottom\" row).\n\nLet's analyze the input block by block, corresponding to the letters of the word.\n\n**Step 3: Decode the First Letter (H)**\n\nLet's look at the characters forming the first letter (approximately columns 1-6):\n*   **Line 1:** `t b b`\n*   **Lines 2-6:** a vertical column `b, b, b, t, b` at the far left.\n*   **Line 7:** `t b t`\n*   **Line 13:** `b b`\n\nApplying our t/b mapping:\n*   The characters at column 1 (`t`, `b`, `b`, `b`, `t`, `b`, `t`, `b`) form a solid **left vertical bar**.\n*   The characters at column 5 (`b` on line 1, `t` on line 7) and nearby columns form the **right vertical bar**.\n*   The `t` on line 5 and the `b`'s on lines 1, 7, and 13 in column 3 form the **horizontal crossbar**.\nThese elements combine to form the letter **H**.\n\n**Step 4: Decode the Second Letter (E)**\n\nLet's look at the characters forming the second letter (approximately columns 7-14):\n*   **Line 1:** `t t t t`\n*   **Line 7:** `b b b b`\n*   **Line 13:** `t t t t`\n*   The first characters of these groups (at column 7) form the spine.\n\nApplying our t/b mapping:\n*   The `t`'s on line 1 create a solid **top horizontal bar**.\n*   The `b`'s on line 7 create a solid **middle horizontal bar**.\n*   The `t`'s on line 13 create a solid **bottom horizontal bar**.\n*   The characters at column 7 (`t` on L1, `b` on L7, `t` on L13) form the **vertical spine**.\nThese elements clearly form the letter **E**.\n\n**Step 5: Decode the Third Letter (L)**\n\nLet's look at the characters forming the third letter (approximately columns 15-21, but primarily using the isolated vertical column):\n*   **Lines 8-12:** The vertical column `b, b, t, t, b` located at column 19.\n*   **Line 13:** `b t b b`\n\nApplying our t/b mapping:\n*   The `b,b,t,t,b` characters at column 19 create a solid **vertical bar**. `t`s fill the top halves, `b`s fill the bottom halves.\n*   The `b t b b` characters on line 13 create a **bottom horizontal bar**.\nThese elements form the letter **L**.\n\n**Step 6: Decode the Fourth Letter (P)**\n\nThe last letter reuses some elements from the 'L' and uses the remaining characters:\n*   **Line 1:** `b b b` (columns 15, 17, 19)\n*   **Line 7:** `b b` (columns 19, 21)\n*   The vertical bar from the 'L' at column 19 is shared.\n\nApplying our t/b mapping:\n*   The **vertical spine** is the same one used for the 'L'.\n*   The `b`'s on Line 1 and Line 7 form the top and middle parts of a closed loop. The `b` at (Line 1, col 19) forms the top-right corner of the loop, and the `b` at (Line 7, col 19) forms the bottom-right corner, closing it against the vertical spine.\nThese elements form the letter **P**.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer**\n\nBy decoding each shape sequentially, we get the letters H, E, L, P.\n\nThe encoded word is HELP.\n\n<<<HELP>>>"
