    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The bromine atom is a good leaving group.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** Tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). This is the conjugate acid of the base and a common solvent for elimination reactions.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. The bulky nature of the base disfavors the SN2 substitution pathway due to steric hindrance.\n\n**2. Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br) and a proton on an adjacent carbon (a β-proton) must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-proton must both be in **axial** positions and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down). This is known as a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n\n**3. Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n*   The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. We need to draw its two possible chair conformations and determine which is more stable.\n*   Let's draw the two conformations and check their stereochemistry. We find that the starting molecule can exist in two chair conformations that are in equilibrium.\n\n    *   **Conformation A:** The bromine atom is in an **axial** position, and the methyl group is in an **equatorial** position.\n    *   **Conformation B:** The bromine atom is in an **equatorial** position, and the methyl group is in an **axial** position.\n\n*   **Stability:** Substituents are generally more stable in the equatorial position to minimize steric strain. The steric strain (A-value) of a methyl group (~1.7 kcal/mol) is much larger than that of a bromine atom (~0.4-0.6 kcal/mol). Therefore, **Conformation A (axial Br, equatorial Me) is significantly more stable** than Conformation B (equatorial Br, axial Me). The molecule will spend most of its time in Conformation A.\n\n**4. Identify the Reactive Conformation and Possible β-Protons**\n*   The E2 reaction can only proceed from a conformation where the leaving group (Br) is **axial**.\n*   **Conformation A** has an axial bromine. Therefore, the reaction will proceed from this more stable conformation.\n*   Now we must identify the β-protons that are axial and trans to the axial bromine. The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **At C2:** There is a β-proton. In Conformation A, this proton is **axial**. It is trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. Elimination is possible here.\n    *   **At C6:** There are two β-protons. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The **axial** proton is trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. Elimination is also possible here.\n\n**5. Determine the Major Product (Regioselectivity)**\n*   Since there are two different sites from which a proton can be removed, two different constitutional isomers can be formed.\n    *   **Path 1 (Elimination of H from C2):** This would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a **trisubstituted** alkene, which is the more thermodynamically stable product (the **Zaitsev product**).\n    *   **Path 2 (Elimination of H from C6):** This would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a **disubstituted** alkene, which is the less thermodynamically stable product (the **Hofmann product**).\n\n*   **The Role of the Bulky Base:** The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product is determined by the base.\n    *   Small bases (like ethoxide) favor the more stable Zaitsev product.\n    *   Bulky, sterically hindered bases (like **potassium tert-butoxide**) have difficulty accessing the more sterically crowded proton. The proton on C2 is more hindered because it is on a tertiary carbon (next to the methyl group). The proton on C6 is on a secondary carbon and is much more sterically accessible.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky tert-butoxide base will preferentially remove the more accessible proton from C6.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe reaction proceeds via an E2 mechanism from the more stable chair conformation where the bromine is axial. Due to the use of a bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide), the reaction favors the abstraction of the less sterically hindered proton, leading to the formation of the less substituted alkene. This is a Hofmann elimination.\n\n*   Zaitsev Product (minor): 1-methylcyclohexene\n*   Hofmann Product (major): 3-methylcyclohexene\n\nThe major product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
