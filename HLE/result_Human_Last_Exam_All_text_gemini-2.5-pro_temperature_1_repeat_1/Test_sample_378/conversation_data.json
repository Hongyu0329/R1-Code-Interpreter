    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find a specific year in which a person, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, publicly adopted or identified with an additional name, \"Azikiwe\".\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Subject's Official Name**\nThe first careful point is to establish the correct and full name of the former President of Nigeria. All official records, reputable news sources (like the BBC, Reuters, and major Nigerian newspapers), and academic publications consistently refer to him as **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. His given first name is Goodluck, and his middle name is Ebele.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate the \"Azikiwe\" Name Claim**\nThe next careful point is to investigate the claim that he identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". A thorough search of public records, news archives, and official statements is required.\n*   There is no evidence in his official biography or political career records of him ever using the name \"Azikiwe\".\n*   He has never signed documents or made public statements using the name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\".\n*   The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. He is a completely different historical and political figure.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Potential Sources of Confusion**\nIt is crucial to consider why this question might be asked. The most likely reason is a confusion between two prominent Nigerian presidents or exposure to misinformation. The question conflates the identity of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan with the famous surname of Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the Conclusion**\nBased on the evidence, the event described in the question—Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never occurred. Therefore, it is impossible to assign a year to an event that did not happen. The premise of the question is factually incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nSince extensive research confirms that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name does not include \"Azikiwe\" and he has never publicly identified himself as such, the answer is that this event has never happened.\n\n<<<Based on all available public records, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. The question is based on an incorrect premise."
