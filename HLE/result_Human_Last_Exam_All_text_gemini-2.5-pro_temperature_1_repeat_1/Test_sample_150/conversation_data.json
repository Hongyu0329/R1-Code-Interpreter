    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided code.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe problem asks us to calculate the final value of a variable `x`, which starts at 0. We are given `n` statements that modify `x`.\n1.  **Variable**: A single integer variable `x`, initialized to `0`.\n2.  **Operations**:\n    *   `++`: Increases `x` by 1.\n    *   `--`: Decreases `x` by 1.\n3.  **Statements**: A statement is a string containing exactly one operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable `X`. The order can be mixed. This gives four possible valid statements:\n    *   `\"++X\"` (pre-increment)\n    *   `\"X++\"` (post-increment)\n    *   `\"--X\"` (pre-decrement)\n    *   `\"X--\"` (post-decrement)\n    For this problem, the distinction between pre- and post-increment/decrement does not matter, as they are not used within larger expressions. Both `++X` and `X++` simply result in `x` being incremented by 1.\n4.  **Input**: An integer `n`, followed by `n` lines, each containing one of the four statements.\n5.  **Output**: The final integer value of `x`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Submitted Java Program\n1.  `int t = inpt.nextInt();`: Reads the number of statements, `n`, into a variable `t`.\n2.  `int tresult = 0;`: Initializes the result variable (representing `x`) to 0.\n3.  `while (t-- > 0)`: A loop that correctly executes `n` times.\n4.  `String test = inpt.next();`: Reads the next statement string.\n5.  `if (test.contains(\"++X\")) { tresult++; }`: It checks if the statement contains the substring `\"++X\"`. If it does, it increments the result.\n6.  `if (test.contains(\"--X\")) { tresult--; }`: It then checks if the statement contains the substring `\"--X\"`. If it does, it decrements the result.\n\n**Flaw Identification**: The crucial mistake is that the program only handles two out of the four possible valid statements.\n*   It correctly processes `\"++X\"` and `\"--X\"`.\n*   It **fails to process** `\"X++\"` and `\"X--\"`.\nIf the input contains `\"X++\"`, the `if` conditions will be false, and `tresult` will not be updated. The same applies to `\"X--\"`. Therefore, the program is **incorrect** as it does not solve the problem for all valid inputs.\n\n### Step 3: List Careful Points for an Efficient C Solution\nTo write an efficient C program, we should consider the following points:\n1.  **Correctness**: The program must handle all four statement types (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`).\n2.  **Efficient Logic**: We don't need to do full string comparisons. Notice that in all four cases, the character at index 1 of the 3-character string uniquely identifies the operation.\n    *   `\"++X\"` -> `s[1]` is `+`\n    *   `\"X++\"` -> `s[1]` is `+`\n    *   `\"--X\"` -> `s[1]` is `-`\n    *   `\"X--\"` -> `s[1]` is `-`\n    Therefore, we only need to read the statement and check the character at index 1 to decide whether to increment or decrement `x`. This is much faster than using string searching functions.\n3.  **Input Reading**: Using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` is a standard and efficient way to read the strings. It is generally faster than reading character by character with `getchar()` for this task.\n4.  **Memory Usage**: To minimize memory, we should use the minimum number of variables. We need one integer for the count (`n`) and one for the result (`x`). We can reuse a small character buffer to read each statement inside the loop. An even more memory-frugal approach would use `getchar()` to read just enough characters to make a decision, avoiding the need for a character buffer entirely.\n\n### Step 4: Acquire the Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, we can determine the components for the final answer `Nx+y`.\n\n*   **Is the program correct?**: No. Therefore, the answer must start with **N**.\n\n*   **x (Smallest number of character comparisons)**: The most efficient logic is to check the character at index 1. This requires only **one** character comparison per statement (e.g., `if (s[1] == '+')`). For an input of 100 statements, the total number of comparisons for the core logic is `100 * 1 = **100**`.\n\n*   **y (Smallest memory size in B)**: An optimal C program can solve the problem using only two integer variables: one to store the number of statements (`n`) and one to store the result (`x`). By processing the input stream character-by-character with a function like `getchar()`, we can avoid allocating a buffer to store the entire statement string. Assuming a standard 32-bit or 64-bit system where an `int` takes 4 bytes, the minimum variable memory required is `sizeof(int) + sizeof(int) = 4 + 4 = **8**` bytes.\n\nCombining these parts, the final answer is `N100+8`.\n\n<<<N100+8>>>"
