    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\". This line is an iambic senarius, a meter common in Roman comedy (like that of Plautus, from whom this line is taken). An iambic senarius consists of six iambic feet, with certain allowed substitutions.\n\n**Step 1: Syllabification and Elision**\n\nFirst, we divide the line into its basic syllables and identify any elisions (where a final vowel or vowel+-m is dropped before a word starting with a vowel).\n\n*   Line: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n*   There is one elision: the `-e` at the end of `bene` is elided with the `e-` at the start of `esse`.\n*   The line is read as: `et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male`\n*   Syllabification of the line as read:\n    `et | ti | bi | be | nes | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\n\n**Step 2: Determining Syllable Quantity (Long or Short)**\n\nNext, we determine the quantity of each syllable based on the rules of Latin prosody.\n*   A syllable is **long (L)** if its vowel is naturally long, is a diphthong, or is \"long by position\" (the vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or by `x` or `z`).\n*   A syllable is **short (S)** if its vowel is naturally short and is followed by only one consonant (or a vowel).\n\nLet's analyze each syllable:\n\n1.  **et**: The vowel `e` is short, but it is followed by the consonant `t` at the end of the word, and the next word begins with a consonant. This makes the syllable closed and thus **L**ong by position.\n2.  **ti-**: The `i` in `tibi` is naturally short. **S**hort.\n3.  **-bi**: The second `i` in `tibi` is also naturally short. **S**hort.\n4.  **be-**: The first syllable of the elided `benesse`. The `e` is naturally short. **S**hort.\n5.  **-nes-**: The second syllable of `benesse`. The `e` is followed by `ss` (two consonants). This makes it **L**ong by position.\n6.  **-se**: The final syllable of `benesse`. The `e` is naturally short. **S**hort.\n7.  **so-**: The first syllable of `soli` (dative of `sōlus`). The `o` is naturally long. **L**ong.\n8.  **-li**: The second syllable of `soli`. The `i` in the dative singular `sōlī` is naturally long. **L**ong.\n9.  **quom**: `quom` is an old spelling of `cum`. The vowel `o` is followed by `m` before a word starting with a consonant (`sibi`). This makes the syllable closed and **L**ong by position.\n10. **si-**: The `i` in `sibi` is naturally short. **S**hort.\n11. **-bi**: The second `i` in `sibi` is also naturally short. **S**hort.\n12. **sit**: The `i` is naturally short, but it is followed by two consonants: the `t` of `sit` and the `m` of the next word, `male`. Therefore, it is **L**ong by position.\n13. **ma-**: The `a` in `male` is naturally short. **S**hort.\n14. **-le**: The final `e` in `male` is naturally short. **S**hort.\n\nThis gives us the following sequence of syllables: **L S S S L S L L L S S L S S**\n\n**Step 3: Grouping Syllables into Metrical Feet**\n\nNow we group this sequence into the six feet of an iambic senarius. The meter allows for substitutions like spondees (L L), anapests (S S L), and even trochees (L S) in certain positions.\n\n*   **Foot 1**: `et ti` -> **L S** (A trochee, a \"reversed iamb\", which is a common substitution in the first foot).\n*   **Foot 2**: `bi be nes` -> **S S L** (An anapest, a standard substitution). This foot is formed from the end of `tibi` and the beginning of the elided `benesse`.\n*   **Foot 3**: `se so` -> **S L** (An iamb, the base foot of the meter). This foot is formed from the end of `benesse` and the start of `soli`.\n*   **Foot 4**: `li quom` -> **L L** (A spondee, a standard substitution). This foot is formed from the end of `soli` and the word `quom`.\n*   **Foot 5**: `si bi sit` -> **S S L** (An anapest, a standard substitution).\n*   **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> **S S** (A pyrrhic, a valid substitution for an iamb in the final foot).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nCombining the feet with a space between each one gives the complete scansion.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
