No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is to deter natural predators, primarily birds, which have vastly different visual systems from humans. Birds are tetrachromatic and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas humans are trichromatic and cannot. Bumblebee color patterns can include UV components, meaning two species that appear identical to a human could look very different to a bird. Using human undergraduates to rank similarity from standard photographs (which don't capture UV data) measures human-perceived similarity, not the predator-perceived similarity that is ecologically relevant for defining a mimicry syndrome. Therefore, the method is fundamentally flawed because it uses the wrong "receiver" for the signal being studied.
