The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal molar Ni/Ce ratio is typically in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 (corresponding to ~10-15 wt% Ni). For thermochemical water splitting (WS), a lower molar Ni/Ce ratio of approximately 0.15 (corresponding to ~5 wt% Ni) is ideal to prevent catalyst deactivation via sintering during the high-temperature steps of the cycle.
