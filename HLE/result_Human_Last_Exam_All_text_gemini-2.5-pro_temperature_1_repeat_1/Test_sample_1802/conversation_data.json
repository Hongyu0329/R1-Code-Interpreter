    "Answering this question requires several steps involving concepts from quantum information theory, including Pauli channels, complementary channels, and their Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski representations.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel Definition:**\n    A qudit is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$. The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_{a,b} | a,b \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}\\}$ form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. There are $d^2$ such operators.\n    A Pauli channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$ is a quantum channel that can be written in the form:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger$\n    where $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ are probabilities such that $\\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} = 1$. The operators $E_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}}} U_{a,b}$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel and its Choi Matrix:**\n    Given a channel $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_k E_k \\rho E_k^\\dagger$, its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is defined through the Stinespring dilation. The construction depends on the set of Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$. Let the number of Kraus operators be $r$. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps an input density matrix on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$ to an output density matrix on an environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E \\cong \\mathbb{C}^r$.\n    The rank of a channel is the rank of its Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$. We are looking for the maximal rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$.\n\n3.  **Key Theorem:**\n    There is a fundamental relationship between the Choi matrix of a channel, its dual, and its complementary channel. Let $\\Phi: M_n(\\mathbb{C}) \\to M_m(\\mathbb{C})$ be a quantum channel with $r$ Kraus operators. Let $\\Phi^\\dagger: M_m(\\mathbb{C}) \\to M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ be its dual channel (with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product). Its Kraus operators are the adjoints of the Kraus operators of $\\Phi$.\n    A key theorem states that if the number of Kraus operators $r$ equals the dimension of the output space $m$ (i.e., $r=m$), then the rank of the complementary channel $\\Phi^c: M_n(\\mathbb{C}) \\to M_r(\\mathbb{C})$ is given by:\n    $\\text{rank}(J(\\Phi^c)) = \\text{rank}((J(\\Phi^\\dagger))^{T_A})$\n    where $T_A$ denotes the partial transpose on the input system space.\n\n4.  **Applying the Theorem to a Pauli Channel:**\n    For our Pauli channel $\\Lambda: M_d(\\mathbb{C}) \\to M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, we have $n=m=d$. The theorem requires a Kraus representation with $r=d$ operators.\n    The Choi rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{a,b}$. To satisfy the condition $r=d$, we must choose a Pauli channel with Choi rank equal to $d$.\n    Let's construct such a channel. We can choose $d$ of the Pauli operators and assign non-zero probabilities to them. Let's pick the phase-gates $Z_k = U_{0,k}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, d-1$. Consider the channel:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} p_k Z_k \\rho Z_k^\\dagger$, with $p_k > 0$ and $\\sum p_k = 1$.\n    This is a Pauli channel with rank $d$. Its Kraus operators are $E_k = \\sqrt{p_k} Z_k$ for $k=0, \\dots, d-1$. The condition $r=d$ is satisfied.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Rank:**\n    Now we apply the theorem. We need to find the rank of $(J(\\Lambda^\\dagger))^{T_A}$.\n    The dual channel is $\\Lambda^\\dagger(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} (\\sqrt{p_k}Z_k)^\\dagger \\rho (\\sqrt{p_k}Z_k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} p_k Z_k^\\dagger \\rho Z_k$. Since $Z_k^\\dagger = Z_{-k}$, and the set $\\{Z_{-k}\\}$ is the same as $\\{Z_k\\}$, this channel is self-adjoint, $\\Lambda^\\dagger = \\Lambda$.\n    So we need to calculate $\\text{rank}((J(\\Lambda))^{T_A})$.\n    The Choi matrix of $\\Lambda$ is $J(\\Lambda) = (\\text{id} \\otimes \\Lambda)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|) = \\frac{1}{d}\\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes \\Lambda(|i\\rangle\\langle j|)$.\n    $\\Lambda(|i\\rangle\\langle j|) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} p_k Z_k|i\\rangle\\langle j|Z_k^\\dagger = \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} p_k (\\omega^{ki}|i\\rangle)(\\omega^{-kj}\\langle j|) = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} p_k \\omega^{k(i-j)}\\right) |i\\rangle\\langle j|$.\n    Let $c_l = \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} p_k \\omega^{kl}$. This is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the probability distribution $(p_0, \\dots, p_{d-1})$.\n    Then $J(\\Lambda) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} c_{i-j} |i\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|$.\n    Now, we take the partial transpose on the first system:\n    $(J(\\Lambda))^{T_A} = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} c_{i-j} (|i\\rangle\\langle j|)^T \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j| = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} c_{i-j} |j\\rangle\\langle i| \\otimes |i\\rangle\\langle j|$.\n    This matrix can be seen as a block matrix. Its rank can be calculated as $d$ times the number of non-zero coefficients $c_l$.\n    To maximize the rank, we need to choose the probabilities $\\{p_k\\}$ such that all $d$ Fourier coefficients $c_l$ are non-zero.\n    This is generally possible. For instance, if we choose $p_0=1-\\epsilon$ and $p_1=\\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon>0$ (and other $p_k=0$, assuming $d \\ge 2$), the coefficients are $c_l = (1-\\epsilon) + \\epsilon \\omega^l$. This expression can only be zero if $\\omega^l = -(1-\\epsilon)/\\epsilon$. For $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1/2)$, the magnitude of the right side is greater than 1, so it cannot equal $\\omega^l$ which has magnitude 1. Thus, all $c_l$ are non-zero. (To satisfy the rank-$d$ condition, one can choose $d$ probabilities, e.g., $p_k>0$ chosen randomly, which will result in all $c_l \\ne 0$ with probability 1).\n    With all $d$ coefficients $c_l$ being non-zero, the rank is:\n    $\\text{rank}((J(\\Lambda))^{T_A}) = d \\times (\\text{number of non-zero } c_l) = d \\times d = d^2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    We have found a Pauli channel for which the complementary channel has rank $d^2$. The rank of a channel $\\mathcal{E}: M_d \\to M_k$ cannot exceed $d^2$ (the square of the input dimension). Therefore, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\nFinal Answer should be the maximal possible rank.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that by choosing a specific Pauli channel of rank $d$, we can make the rank of its complementary channel equal to $d^2$. This is the maximum possible rank for a channel with a $d$-dimensional input space."
