    "An analysis of the question of finding the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the group in question: Generalized Quaternion Group of size 128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$, denoted $Q_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n$Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, x^{2^{n-2}} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nThe size of the group is 128, which is $2^7$. So, we are dealing with $Q_{128}$, which corresponds to $n=7$.\nThe presentation for $Q_{128}$ is:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nKey properties of $G = Q_{128}$:\n*   The order of $G$ is 128. It is a 2-group.\n*   The element $x$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64. This is a normal subgroup of index 2.\n*   The elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ are of the form $yx^k$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 63$.\n*   The order of any element $g \\notin \\langle x \\rangle$ is 4, since $(yx^k)^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$, and $(x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   The exponent of the group is the least common multiple of the orders of its elements. The orders are powers of 2, with the maximum being the order of $x$, which is 64. So, the exponent of $Q_{128}$ is 64.\n\n**2. Define \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nThe term \"power subgroup\" can be ambiguous, but in the context of group theory, particularly p-groups, it has a standard definition. A **power subgroup** of a group $G$, denoted $G^k$, is the subgroup generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$.\n$G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\nThe question asks for the number of distinct subgroups that can be expressed in the form $G^k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\n*Careful Point:* Another possible interpretation is \"cyclic subgroup\". A cyclic subgroup is generated by a single element, which can be seen as a \"power\" of that element. However, the term \"power subgroup\" is more formally associated with the $G^k$ notation. We will proceed with the standard definition, as it is more specific and technical.\n\n**3. Determine the set of all Power Subgroups**\n\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$.\n\n*   **Simplifying the values of k:**\n    Let $k$ be any positive integer. We can write $k = 2^j \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd integer and $j \\ge 0$.\n    The power subgroup is $G^k = G^{2^j \\cdot m} = \\langle g^{2^j \\cdot m} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = \\langle (g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    Since $G=Q_{128}$ is a 2-group (its order is a power of 2), and $m$ is odd, the map $\\phi: G \\to G$ given by $\\phi(g) = g^m$ is a bijection. This means the set $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is the same as the set $G$.\n    Therefore, $\\langle (g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = \\langle h^{2^j} \\mid h \\in G \\rangle = G^{2^j}$.\n    So, any power subgroup $G^k$ is equal to $G^{2^j}$ for some $j \\ge 0$. This greatly simplifies our task: we only need to compute the subgroups $G^{2^j}$ and count how many of them are distinct.\n\n*   **Calculating the power subgroups $G^{2^j}$:**\n    We need to evaluate $G^{2^j}$ for $j=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n    *   **j=0 (k=1):** $G^1 = \\langle g^1 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = G = Q_{128}$. This is the first power subgroup.\n    *   **j=1 (k=2):** $G^2 = \\langle g^2 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n        - If $g \\in \\langle x \\rangle$, say $g=x^i$, then $g^2 = x^{2i}$. These elements generate the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n        - If $g \\notin \\langle x \\rangle$, say $g=yx^i$, then $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n        - $G^2$ is generated by all these squares. So $G^2 = \\langle \\langle x^2 \\rangle, x^{32} \\rangle$. Since $x^{32} = (x^{16})^2$, it is already an element of $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n        - Thus, $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $64/2 = 32$. It is distinct from $G$.\n    *   **j=2 (k=4):** $G^4 = \\langle g^4 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n        - If $g \\in \\langle x \\rangle$, $g=x^i$, then $g^4 = x^{4i}$. These generate $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n        - If $g \\notin \\langle x \\rangle$, its order is 4, so $g^4 = 1$.\n        - Thus, $G^4 = \\langle \\langle x^4 \\rangle, 1 \\rangle = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $64/4 = 16$.\n    *   **For j â‰¥ 2:** In general, for $j \\ge 2$, $2^j$ is a multiple of 4.\n        - If $g \\in \\langle x \\rangle$, $g^{2^j} = x^{i \\cdot 2^j}$. These generate $\\langle x^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n        - If $g \\notin \\langle x \\rangle$, its order is 4, so $g^{2^j} = (g^4)^{2^{j-2}} = 1^{2^{j-2}} = 1$.\n        - Thus, for $j \\ge 2$, $G^{2^j} = \\langle x^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Listing the distinct power subgroups:**\n    We can now list the distinct subgroups by calculating $G^{2^j}$ for increasing $j$:\n    *   $j=0: G^1 = Q_{128}$ (Order 128)\n    *   $j=1: G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (Order 32)\n    *   $j=2: G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (Order 16)\n    *   $j=3: G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (Order 8)\n    *   $j=4: G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (Order 4)\n    *   $j=5: G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (Order 2)\n    *   $j=6: G^{64} = \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (The trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\n    For any $j > 6$, since the exponent of $G$ is 64, $g^{64}=1$ for all $g \\in G$. Therefore, $g^{2^j} = (g^{64})^{2^{j-6}} = 1$. This means $G^{2^j} = \\{1\\}$ for all $j \\ge 6$.\n\n**4. Count the distinct subgroups**\n\nThe set of distinct power subgroups is $\\{Q_{128}, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$.\nThese subgroups are all distinct, which can be easily verified by checking their orders (128, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).\nCounting the elements in this set, we find there are 7 distinct power subgroups.\n\nThis result can be generalized: for the generalized quaternion group $Q_{2^n}$, there are $n$ power subgroups. For $Q_{128} = Q_{2^7}$, $n=7$.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe step-by-step analysis has robustly identified the set of all power subgroups by first simplifying the problem to powers of 2, and then calculating each member of this resulting series of subgroups. The subgroups are identified and shown to be distinct. The final count is the size of this set.\n\nThe number of distinct power subgroups is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
