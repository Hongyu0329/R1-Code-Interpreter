    "This question requires a careful analysis of the text of John Milton's *Paradise Lost* to identify and count all individuals who can be classified as \"historical saints\" and are mentioned by name.\n\n### Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\" in the Context of Milton\n\nFirst, we must establish what \"historical saint\" means for this question. John Milton was a 17th-century English Puritan. He would not have subscribed to the Roman Catholic process of canonization. For Milton, a \"saint\" would be any of the \"elect\" or holy people chosen by God, particularly the revered figures from the biblical narrative. Therefore, our search should include key figures from both the Old and New Testaments who are presented as exemplars of faith and righteousness. The question also specifies they must be \"mentioned by name.\"\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Searching *Paradise Lost*\n\nThe most fertile ground for finding these names is in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael reveals the future of mankind to Adam. However, other saints are mentioned elsewhere in the epic. We will proceed through the text to build a comprehensive list.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying and Listing the Saints\n\n**Old Testament Saints:**\n\n1.  **Moses**: A major prophet and leader of the Israelites. He is mentioned by name multiple times, first in Book I as the one whose song triumphed \"o'er Egyptian pride,\" and later in Book VII and Book XII.\n2.  **Abraham**: The patriarch of the Israelites. He is named in Book III and again in Book XII as the father of a faithful nation.\n3.  **Jacob**: The grandson of Abraham. He is mentioned by name in Book III in the context of God's covenant.\n4.  **David**: The King of Israel and psalmist. He is named in Book III and again in Book XII as the ancestor from whose royal stock the Messiah would come.\n5.  **Abel**: The son of Adam and the first martyr. He is mentioned by name in Book XI as Michael begins to show Adam the consequences of the Fall.\n6.  **Enoch**: The righteous patriarch who \"walked with God\" and was taken to Heaven without dying. He is named in Book XI.\n7.  **Noah**: The patriarch who built the Ark and survived the Great Flood. He is named and his story is recounted in Book XI.\n8.  **Joshua**: The successor to Moses who led the Israelites into the Promised Land. He is mentioned by name in Book XII.\n9.  **Solomon**: The son of David, known for building the Temple in Jerusalem. He is named in Book XII.\n\nThis gives us a total of **9** saints from the Old Testament.\n\n**New Testament Saints:**\n\n10. **Mary**: The mother of Jesus. She is mentioned by name in Book XII, identified as the \"virgin\" who will bear the Savior.\n11. **Simeon**: The devout man who recognized the infant Jesus as the Messiah. He is named in Book XII as one of the \"just men\" who awaited the \"consolation of Israel.\"\n12. **John (the Baptist)**: The forerunner of Christ. He is first referred to as \"the Baptist\" in Book III and then explicitly named \"John\" in Book XII.\n13. **Peter**: The Apostle. He is mentioned by name in Book XII in the context of the founding of the Church and the subsequent corruption that Milton believed followed.\n\nThis gives us a total of **4** saints from the New Testament.\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally and Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lists, we can determine the total number of historical saints mentioned by name. It is important to note that while other holy figures like Isaac, Joseph, the prophet Daniel, or the apostle Paul are central to the Bible, their specific names do not appear in the text of *Paradise Lost*. Milton's selection is curated for his specific theological and narrative purposes.\n\n*   Old Testament Saints: 9\n*   New Testament Saints: 4\n*   **Total = 9 + 4 = 13**\n\nThere are 13 historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<13>>>"
