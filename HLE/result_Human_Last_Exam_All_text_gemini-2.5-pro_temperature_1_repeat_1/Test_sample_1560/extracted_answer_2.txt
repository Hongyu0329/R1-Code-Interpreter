The final state of the system depends on the measurement outcome on ququint A. The possibilities are:
1. With a probability of 2/10, the measurement outcome is $|0\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2. With a probability of 2/10, the measurement outcome is $|1\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3. With a probability of 3/10, the measurement outcome is $|2\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4. With a probability of 2/10, the measurement outcome is $|3\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5. With a probability of 1/10, the measurement outcome is $|4\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
