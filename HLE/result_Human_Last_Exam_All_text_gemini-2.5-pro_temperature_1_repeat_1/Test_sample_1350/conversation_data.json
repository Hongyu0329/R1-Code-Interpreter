    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source Text:** William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n    *   **Action:** A character visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Description:** The character describes the religious practices of the Romans.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description is a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, who were suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:**\n    The novel is about a Gothic tribe, the Wolfings, preparing to fight the invading Romans. Most characters would have knowledge of the Romans only as enemies. The question requires a character with firsthand experience *inside* a Roman city. This points to someone who has been a captive or a traveler.\n\n3.  **Scan the Plot for Relevant Scenes:**\n    Early in the book, in Chapter VI, titled \"They Talk of the Romans,\" the Wolfing chieftains gather to discuss the Roman threat. They need information about their enemy's nature, strength, and customs. To get this information, they turn to someone with direct experience.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Character and Their Testimony:**\n    In this chapter, the character who speaks up is a man named **the Otter**. He is a thrall (a servant or slave) who was captured by the Romans in his youth and lived for a time in one of their cities before escaping. Because of this experience, he is asked to describe the Romans to the assembly.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Otter's Description:**\n    The Otter describes what he saw in a Roman temple (\"Gods'-house\"). He recounts seeing a statue or image that clearly depicts the founding myth of Rome, but he describes it from his own cultural perspective, without knowing the specific names.\n    *   He mentions that the Romans \"worship a She-wolf.\"\n    *   He describes the image of this she-wolf suckling \"two man-cubs at her teats.\"\n    *   He expresses his Gothic people's disgust at this \"unseemly\" story, finding it monstrous that the founders of a great people were \"sucklings of a wild-wood beast.\"\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The Otter is the character who directly fulfills all the conditions of the question. He visited a Roman city (as a thrall), and he describes their religious iconography in a way that any reader familiar with Roman history will immediately recognize as the Capitoline Wolf statue depicting the she-wolf nursing the twins, Romulus and Remus.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Perspective:** The description is deliberately framed from the viewpoint of an outsider (a Goth) who finds the Roman founding myth strange and unnatural. This is a key stylistic choice by William Morris.\n*   **Character's Role:** The Otter's status as a former thrall is what gives him this unique and crucial knowledge. No other major character in the tribe has this specific background.\n*   **Specificity:** The question is precise. It's not just about who fought the Romans, but about who saw their city life and described their specific founding myth. This narrows the answer down from any of the Wolfing warriors to the one person with that experience.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the character who visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus is the thrall known as the Otter.\n\n<<<The Otter>>>"
