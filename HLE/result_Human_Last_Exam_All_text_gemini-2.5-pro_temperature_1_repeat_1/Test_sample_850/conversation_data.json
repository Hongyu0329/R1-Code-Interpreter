    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe user is asking for crystal classes that satisfy three specific conditions:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (roto-inversion $\\bar{n}$ or a mirror plane $m = \\bar{2}$).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique direction, meaning it cannot exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment. This requires the presence of a center of inversion or symmetry elements that prevent a unique vector from existing (e.g., multiple rotation axes).\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. Fundamentally, this phenomenon requires the material structure to be **chiral**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Resolve the Core Contradiction\n\nThere is a direct contradiction in the question. A crystal class cannot be both **achiral** (condition 1) and possess the standard requirement for optical activity, which is **chirality** (implied by condition 3).\n\nTo resolve this, we must adopt a more nuanced physical definition of \"symmetry for optical activity\". Optical activity is described by a second-rank axial tensor called the gyration tensor, $g_{ij}$. A material can be considered to have the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" if its gyration tensor is allowed by symmetry to have non-zero components.\n\nAccording to Neumann's principle, the gyration tensor must be invariant under all symmetry operations of the crystal's point group. Analysis shows that the gyration tensor is zero for all centrosymmetric crystal classes (those possessing a center of inversion, $\\bar{1}$). However, it can have non-zero components for **all non-centrosymmetric** crystal classes.\n\nThis set of non-centrosymmetric classes includes the 11 chiral classes (where optical activity is always observable along an optic axis) and 10 non-centrosymmetric achiral classes (where optical activity is typically only observable for light propagating in general directions, not along optic axes).\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable interpretation of the question is to find the crystal classes that are:\n1.  **Non-centrosymmetric** (this is our interpretation of \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\")\n2.  **Achiral**\n3.  **Non-polar**\n\n### Step 3: Systematically Filter the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nWe will now find the crystal classes that meet these three reformulated criteria.\n\n**A. Start with all 32 crystal classes.**\n\n**B. Apply Condition 1: Must be Non-centrosymmetric.**\nWe eliminate the 11 centrosymmetric classes, which all possess a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$).\nThe centrosymmetric classes are: $\\bar{1}, 2/m, mmm, \\bar{3}, \\bar{3}m, 4/m, 4/mmm, 6/m, 6/mmm, m\\bar{3}, m\\bar{3}m$.\nThis leaves us with the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes.\n\n**C. Apply Condition 2: Must be Achiral.**\nFrom the remaining 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, we must eliminate those that are chiral. A chiral class lacks all improper rotation axes (including mirror planes and inversion centers).\nThe 11 chiral classes are: $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432$.\nRemoving these leaves 10 classes that are both non-centrosymmetric and achiral:\n$m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, \\bar{4}, \\bar{6}, \\bar{4}2m, \\bar{6}m2, \\bar{4}3m$.\n\n**D. Apply Condition 3: Must be Non-polar.**\nFrom the remaining 10 classes, we must eliminate those that are polar. A polar class has a unique axis where the two directions along the axis are not equivalent by symmetry.\nThe polar classes are defined as: $1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm$.\nWe check which of our 10 candidate classes are in this list of polar classes:\n*   $m$ is polar.\n*   $mm2$ is polar.\n*   $3m$ is polar.\n*   $4mm$ is polar.\n*   $6mm$ is polar.\n\nRemoving these 5 polar classes from our list of 10 candidates leaves the final set of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity (interpreted as being non-centrosymmetric) are the five remaining classes from the previous step.\n\nThe final list of crystal classes is:\n*   **$\\bar{4}$**\n*   **$\\bar{6}$**\n*   **$\\bar{4}2m$**\n*   **$\\bar{6}m2$**\n*   **$\\bar{4}3m$**\n\nThese five classes are non-centrosymmetric (allowing for a non-zero gyration tensor), achiral (containing improper rotations like $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{6}$, or mirror planes), and non-polar (possessing symmetry that prevents a unique vector direction).\n\n<<<The five crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}m2$, and $\\bar{4}3m$.>>>"
