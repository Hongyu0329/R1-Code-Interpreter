The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **giant fibre lobe**. The posterior chromatophore lobes are located dorsal-posteriorly, while the giant fibre lobe constitutes the posterior-most tip of the palliovisceral lobe itself.
