    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses the logarithm of the product of two matrix exponentials, $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, as a series in terms of nested commutators of X and Y.\n$Z = X + Y + Z_2(X,Y) + Z_3(X,Y) + \\dots + Z_n(X,Y) + \\dots$\nwhere $Z_n(X,Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ in X and Y, constructed from commutators. For example:\n*   $Z_1 = X + Y$\n*   $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n*   $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [Y, X]]$\n\nThe question \"What is the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10?\" asks for the number of linearly independent terms of degree 10 that can appear in this expansion. This is equivalent to finding the dimension of the vector space spanned by all possible nested commutators of degree 10 involving two variables, X and Y.\n\n### Step 2: Connection to Free Lie Algebras\n\nThe set of all formal linear combinations of nested commutators of a set of generators (in this case, X and Y) forms a mathematical structure called a **free Lie algebra**, denoted $L(X, Y)$. This algebra is graded by degree, meaning it can be decomposed into subspaces of homogeneous polynomials of a specific degree:\n$L(X, Y) = \\bigoplus_{n=1}^\\infty L_n(X, Y)$\nwhere $L_n(X, Y)$ is the subspace of all Lie polynomials of degree $n$.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the dimension of the subspace $L_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Witt Formula\n\nThere is a powerful formula, known as the **Witt formula**, that calculates the dimension of the n-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on k generators. The formula is:\n\n$d_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $d_n(k)$ is the dimension we want to find.\n*   $n$ is the degree (or order), which is 10 in our case.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators, which is 2 (X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive integers $d$ that divide $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the **Möbius function**.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Witt Formula - Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Identify Parameters:**\n    *   Degree $n = 10$.\n    *   Number of generators $k = 2$.\n\n2.  **Find the Divisors of n=10:**\n    The positive divisors of 10 are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Möbius Function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    The Möbius function is defined as:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = (-1)^k$ if $d$ is a product of $k$ distinct primes.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\n\n    For our divisors:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 is a single prime).\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 is a single prime).\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\times 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 is a product of 2 distinct primes).\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Witt Formula:**\n    $d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d \\in \\{1,2,5,10\\}} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n    $d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10} \\right]$\n\n5.  **Evaluate each term in the sum:**\n    *   Term for $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10} = 1 \\cdot 1024 = 1024$.\n    *   Term for $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{5} = -1 \\cdot 32 = -32$.\n    *   Term for $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{2} = -1 \\cdot 4 = -4$.\n    *   Term for $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{1} = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n\n6.  **Complete the calculation:**\n    $d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]$\n    $d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} [990]$\n    $d_{10}(2) = 99$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients (i.e., the number of linearly independent Lie polynomials) of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
