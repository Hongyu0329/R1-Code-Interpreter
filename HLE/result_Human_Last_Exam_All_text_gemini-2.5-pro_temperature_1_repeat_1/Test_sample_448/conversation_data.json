    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The first step is to list the naturally occurring noble gases, which are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. These are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn). Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is not a candidate.\n\n2.  **Understand the Scope:** The question asks for the rarest gas as a percentage of \"all terrestrial matter\" in the year 2002. \"Terrestrial matter\" refers to the substance of the Earth, including its atmosphere, crust, mantle, and core. The main reservoir for noble gases is the atmosphere, so atmospheric abundance is the most common and relevant measure of their overall quantity. The year 2002 is specified, but the relative abundances of these elements do not change on such short timescales, so standard abundance figures are applicable.\n\n3.  **Gather Abundance Data:** We need to find the typical abundance of each noble gas on Earth. These are usually expressed as a percentage or in parts per million (ppm) by volume in the atmosphere.\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** It is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% (9340 ppm) of Earth's atmosphere.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** Its atmospheric abundance is about 0.0018% (18.18 ppm).\n    *   **Helium (He):** Its atmospheric abundance is about 0.00052% (5.24 ppm). Although it is produced by radioactive decay in the crust, its low density allows it to escape into space.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Its atmospheric abundance is about 0.00011% (1.14 ppm).\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** It is very rare, with an atmospheric abundance of about 0.0000087% (0.087 ppm, or 87 parts per billion).\n\n4.  **Analyze Radon (Rn):** Radon is a special case. Unlike the other noble gases listed above, Radon is radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days. It is constantly formed from the radioactive decay of radium (found in soil and rock) and constantly decays into other elements. Because it decays so quickly, it never has a chance to accumulate in the atmosphere or anywhere else.\n\n5.  **Compare Abundances to Determine the Rarest:**\n    *   Comparing the stable noble gases, Xenon (Xe) is the rarest, with a concentration of just 0.087 ppm.\n    *   However, we must compare Xenon's abundance to Radon's. Due to Radon's extremely short half-life, its average concentration in the atmosphere is minuscule, estimated to be around 1 part in 10^21 (or 10^-19 ppm). This is many orders of magnitude rarer than Xenon.\n    *   At any given moment, the total amount of Radon gas in the entire Earth's atmosphere is only a few tens of kilograms, whereas the amount of Xenon is trillions of times greater.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEven though Xenon is very rare among the stable noble gases, Radon's radioactivity and extremely short half-life mean that its instantaneous quantity on Earth is far, far smaller. Therefore, Radon is the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Definition of \"Rarest\":** The question implies the amount present at a given time (instantaneous abundance), not the total amount ever produced.\n*   **Stability:** The key differentiator is radioactivity. All noble gases except Radon are stable. Radon's instability and short half-life prevent it from accumulating.\n*   **Location:** While Radon concentrations can be locally higher near the ground over certain geological formations, its average concentration throughout all \"terrestrial matter\" (especially the vast atmosphere) is incredibly low.\n*   **Date:** The year 2002 is irrelevant as the fundamental properties and relative abundances of these gases have not changed.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
