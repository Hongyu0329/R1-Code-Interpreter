    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$$ -x(x - 1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points. We find two distinct equilibrium points:\n$x_1 = 0$\n$x_2 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at that point.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use other methods.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point.\n\n**Stability of $x_1 = 0$:**\nEvaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=0$:\n$$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\nSince $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n**Stability of $x_2 = 1$:**\nEvaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=1$:\n$$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\nSince $f'(1) = 0$, the linear stability test is inconclusive. We need to analyze the behavior of the function $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Sign analysis for the stability of $x=1$**\n\nWe analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ around $x=1$.\n*   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$):\n    $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t) < 0$, which means the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$. So, the point is unstable from the left.\n*   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$):\n    $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t) < 0$, which means the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$. So, the point is stable from the right.\n\nAn equilibrium point that is stable from one side and unstable from the other is called **semi-stable**. A stable equilibrium must be stable from both sides (i.e., solutions starting on either side of the point must converge to it). Therefore, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibria, $m$**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is a semi-stable equilibrium point.\n\nThe question asks for the number of **stable** equilibrium points. Thus, we only count $x=0$.\nSo, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ we found:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
