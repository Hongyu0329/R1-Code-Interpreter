    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Figure and Context**\nThe central figure is Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943), a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician. He was the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets). The context is his criticism of Western culture during his time, specifically the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Accusation**\nThe question states that Milyukov accused a group, \"X-Ys\", of being a \"stagnant swamp\". This is a very strong and specific metaphor, suggesting he saw the group's cultural output as decadent, unproductive, and decaying.\n\n**Step 3: Research Milyukov's Cultural Stance**\nWhile Milyukov was a political \"Westernizer\" who advocated for Russia to adopt Western-style constitutional democracy, he was culturally conservative. He held strong views on art and literature, championing the realist traditions of the 19th century. He was deeply critical of the new, experimental art movements emerging at the turn of the century.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the \"Stagnant Swamp\" Quote**\nHistorical sources confirm that Milyukov used this exact phrase. His most famous use of it was in a newspaper review of the first \"World of Art\" (Mir Iskusstva) exhibition in St. Petersburg in 1899. This exhibition, organized by Sergei Diaghilev, showcased the works of avant-garde Russian and European artists who broke from academic tradition.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Target of the Insult**\nMilyukov's review was a direct attack on the artists and artistic philosophy of the \"World of Art\" movement. These artists were associated with the broader European movements of Symbolism and Art Nouveau. Critics like Milyukov, who were hostile to this new art, frequently labeled its practitioners with the pejorative term \"Decadents.\" They saw the art's focus on mysticism, individualism, and aesthetics-for-aesthetics'-sake as a sign of cultural and moral decay.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Identity of \"X-Y\"**\nThe artists Milyukov was attacking were followers of Symbolism and were derisively called Decadents. These two terms were often used together to describe this specific cultural phenomenon. Therefore, the compound term that fits the \"X-Y\" format and accurately describes the group Milyukov denounced is \"Symbolist-Decadents\".\n\n**Conclusion**\nPavel Milyukov, a cultural conservative, saw the emerging modernist art movements as a corrupting influence. He famously used the phrase \"stagnant swamp\" to describe the work of artists associated with Symbolism and the \"World of Art\" movement, whom he and other critics jointly referred to as Symbolist-Decadents.\n\n<<<Symbolist-Decadents>>>"
