    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to calculate the ratio `R`, defined as:\n`R = (Uncertainty in momentum) / (Momentum in the first Bohr orbit) = Δp / p`\n\n**2. Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\nThis is determined using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n*   **Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (`Δx`) and momentum (`Δp`) must be at least a certain minimum value. The mathematical expression is:\n    `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`h / 2π`).\n\n*   **Applying the Principle:** For problems of this nature, we calculate the minimum possible uncertainty by using the equality:\n    `Δx * Δp = ħ / 2`\n\n*   **Solving for Δp:** We are given the uncertainty in position, `Δx = 10 pm`. First, we must convert this to SI units (meters).\n    `Δx = 10 pm = 10 × 10⁻¹² m = 1.0 × 10⁻¹¹ m`\n    Now, we rearrange the formula to find `Δp`:\n    `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n**3. Calculate the Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p)**\nThis is determined using the postulates of the Bohr model for the hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **Bohr's Postulate:** The angular momentum (`L`) of an electron in an orbit is quantized and given by:\n    `L = nħ`\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number. For the first Bohr orbit, `n = 1`.\n\n*   **Applying the Postulate:** For the first orbit (`n=1`), the angular momentum is:\n    `L = 1 * ħ = ħ`\n\n*   **Relating to Linear Momentum:** Angular momentum is also defined as `L = r * p`, where `r` is the orbital radius and `p` is the linear momentum. For the first orbit, this is `L = r₁ * p`, where `r₁` is the radius of the first Bohr orbit.\n\n*   **Solving for p:** By equating the two expressions for `L`, we get:\n    `r₁ * p = ħ`\n    Rearranging to solve for `p`:\n    `p = ħ / r₁`\n\n**4. Formulate the Ratio (R = Δp / p)**\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for `Δp` and `p` into the ratio.\n\n*   `R = [ħ / (2 * Δx)] / [ħ / r₁]`\n\n*   **Simplification:** We can simplify this expression. Notice that the reduced Planck constant `ħ` appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out.\n    `R = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) * (r₁ / ħ)`\n    `R = r₁ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n**5. Substitute Values and Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe final step is to plug in the known values for `r₁` and `Δx`.\n\n*   **Radius of the first Bohr orbit (Bohr Radius), r₁:**\n    `r₁ = a₀ ≈ 5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m`\n\n*   **Uncertainty in position, Δx:**\n    `Δx = 1.0 × 10⁻¹¹ m`\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    `R = (5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 * 1.0 × 10⁻¹¹ m)`\n    `R = 5.29 / 2`\n    `R = 2.645`\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Unit Consistency:** It is crucial to convert all quantities to standard SI units (meters for distance) before performing calculations.\n2.  **Choice of Formula:** Using the correct form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (`Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`) is important. Using `h` or `ħ` instead of `ħ/2` would lead to a different numerical result.\n3.  **Physical Constants:** Use the standard value for the Bohr radius (`a₀`).\n4.  **Simplification:** The cancellation of `ħ` is a key step that simplifies the problem and eliminates the need to use its numerical value, reducing the chance of error.\n\nThe final ratio is a dimensionless number, which is expected.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
