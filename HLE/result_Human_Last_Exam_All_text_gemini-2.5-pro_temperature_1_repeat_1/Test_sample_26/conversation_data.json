    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object and the question\n*   $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the complex projective space of dimension 3. It is a real 6-dimensional manifold.\n*   $X$ is a complex submanifold of complex dimension 2, so it's a real 4-dimensional manifold.\n*   We need to find the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group $G$ is the dimension of the vector space $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. This is equivalent to finding the dimension of the rational third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 2: Basic topological properties of X\nWe use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, which relates the topology of a variety to its smooth hypersurface sections.\n*   Let $Y$ be a complex projective manifold of complex dimension $n$, and $X$ be a smooth hypersurface in $Y$. The inclusion map $i: X \\to Y$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(Y)$ for $k < n-1$ and a surjection for $k = n-1$.\n*   In our case, $Y = \\mathbb{CP}^3$, so $n=3$. $X$ is a smooth hypersurface, so its complex dimension is 2.\n*   The theorem applies for $k < 3-1=2$.\n*   For $k=1$, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$), $X$ is also simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$).\n*   The theorem does not give direct information about $\\pi_3(X)$. However, knowing that $X$ is simply connected is crucial.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Betti numbers of X\nSince we are interested in the rank of a homotopy group, we can use tools from rational homotopy theory, which relates rational homotopy groups to rational cohomology. First, we need the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups, which are the Betti numbers $b_k(X) = \\dim H^k(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n*   $X$ is a connected 4-dimensional manifold, so $b_0(X) = 1$.\n*   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, so $b_1(X)=0$.\n*   By Poincaré Duality for a compact orientable 4-manifold, $b_3(X) = b_{4-1}(X) = b_1(X)=0$.\n*   Also by Poincaré Duality, $b_4(X)=b_0(X)=1$.\n*   To find $b_2(X)$, we compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2+b_2$.\n*   The Euler characteristic can also be computed by integrating the second Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$, $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(TX)$.\n*   Using the adjunction formula for the tangent bundle $TX \\oplus N_X \\cong T\\mathbb{CP}^3|_X$, where $N_X$ is the normal bundle of $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   For a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the normal bundle is the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_X(d)$. Here $d=5$.\n*   The total Chern class of $T\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is $c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3) = (1+H)^4$, where $H$ is the hyperplane class in $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   Restricting to $X$, let $h=i^*H \\in H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. We have $c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3|_X) = (1+h)^4 = 1+4h+6h^2$.\n*   The Chern class of the normal bundle is $c(N_X) = c(\\mathcal{O}_X(5)) = 1+5h$.\n*   The Chern class of the tangent bundle is $c(TX) = c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3|_X) / c(N_X) = (1+4h+6h^2)(1+5h)^{-1} = (1+4h+6h^2)(1-5h+25h^2-\\dots) = 1 - h + 11h^2 + \\dots$.\n*   So, $c_1(TX)=-h$ and $c_2(TX)=11h^2$.\n*   $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(TX) = \\int_X 11h^2 = 11 \\int_X h^2$. The integral $\\int_X h^2$ is the degree of $X$, which is 5.\n*   $\\chi(X) = 11 \\cdot 5 = 55$.\n*   Equating the two expressions for $\\chi(X)$, we get $2+b_2 = 55$, which implies $b_2(X)=53$.\n*   Summary of Betti numbers: $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=53, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n\n### Step 4: Use Rational Homotopy Theory\nWe use Sullivan's theory of minimal models to compute the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$. For a simply connected space $X$, its rational homotopy type is captured by a free commutative differential graded algebra $(\\Lambda V, d)$, called the minimal model.\n*   The vector space $V$ is graded, $V = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 2} V^k$, and its dual is related to the rational homotopy groups: $V^k \\cong \\text{Hom}(\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}, \\mathbb{Q})$. The rank of $\\pi_k(X)$ is $\\dim V^k$.\n*   The cohomology of the minimal model is isomorphic to the rational cohomology of the space: $H^*(\\Lambda V, d) \\cong H^*(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n*   $b_1(X)=0 \\implies \\pi_1(X)$ is finite. We know it is trivial. Thus $V^1=0$.\n*   $H^2(\\Lambda V, d) \\cong V^2$, since $V^1=0$. So $\\dim V^2 = b_2(X)=53$.\n*   $H^3(\\Lambda V, d) \\cong \\ker(d: V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V^2)$. Since $H^3(X; \\mathbb{Q})=0$, we must have $\\ker(d|_{V^3})=0$, which means the differential map $d$ is injective on $V^3$.\n*   $H^4(\\Lambda V, d) \\cong \\ker(d: \\Lambda^2 V^2 \\to \\Lambda^3 V^2 \\oplus V^2\\wedge V^3 \\oplus \\dots) / \\text{im}(d: V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V^2)$. Since $V^1=0$, $d(\\Lambda^2 V^2)=0$. So $H^4(\\Lambda V, d) \\cong \\Lambda^2 V^2 / d(V^3)$.\n*   We know $\\dim H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})=b_4=1$. Therefore, $\\dim(\\Lambda^2 V^2 / d(V^3)) = 1$.\n*   This implies $\\dim(\\Lambda^2 V^2) - \\dim(d(V^3)) = 1$.\n*   The dimension of $\\Lambda^2 V^2$ is $\\binom{\\dim V^2}{2} = \\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 1378$.\n*   So, $\\dim(d(V^3)) = 1378 - 1 = 1377$.\n*   Since $d$ is injective on $V^3$, we have $\\dim V^3 = \\dim(d(V^3))$.\n*   Therefore, $\\dim V^3 = 1377$.\n*   The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is $\\dim V^3$.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to $\\dim V^3$. Based on the analysis above:\nRank$(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim V^3 = 1377$.\n\nA key point in the argument is that for a simply connected 4-manifold, the image of $d: V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V^2$ is the kernel of the cup product pairing $\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$. Since the intersection form on $H^2(X)$ is non-degenerate, this pairing is a surjective map from a space of dimension 1378 to a space of dimension 1. Its kernel has dimension $1378-1=1377$, confirming the result.\n\nFinal answer is the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, which is 1377.\n\n<<<1377>>>"
