    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question concerns the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri* and a specific feature of its skull: the \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a bone that forms the front margin of the eye socket. A recess is a hollow or indentation, in this case, a pneumatic (air-filled) one.\n\n2.  **Consult Primary Scientific Literature:** To answer a specific anatomical question about a fossil species, we must refer to the primary scientific papers that describe the fossil. The key descriptive paper for the skull of *Irritator challengeri* (holotype specimen SMNS 58022) is \"Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002).\n\n3.  **Locate the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** Within the Sues et al. (2002) paper, there is a specific section describing the lacrimal bone. This section details the shape, connections, and features of this bone.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Recess:** The paper describes a large opening on the side of the lacrimal bone, which is the lacrimal recess. The crucial detail for this question is how this recess is structured internally.\n\n5.  **Extract the Specific Count:** The paper explicitly states: \"The lacrimal recess is subdivided by a vertical ridge into a larger, subtriangular anterior depression and a smaller, oval posterior depression.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity:** The question is not about the total number of openings (fenestrae) in the skull, but specifically about the subdivisions *within* the lacrimal recess on the lacrimal bone.\n*   **Source Authority:** Relying on the original scientific description is crucial for accuracy, as this is the foundational data for all subsequent studies.\n*   **Terminology:** Understanding the terms \"lacrimal,\" \"recess,\" and \"depression\" is key to interpreting the question and the scientific text correctly. The \"lacrimal recess\" is the main hollow, and the \"depressions\" are the smaller hollows within it.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBased on the direct description in the authoritative scientific paper, the single lacrimal recess is divided by a ridge into two smaller, distinct depressions. Therefore, the lacrimal recess contains two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
