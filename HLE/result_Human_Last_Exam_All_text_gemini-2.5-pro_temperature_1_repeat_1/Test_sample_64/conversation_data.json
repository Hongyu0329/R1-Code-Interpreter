    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Reading:**\n    The word is 「弟」. Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Count the Morae:**\n    A mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese. We need to break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n    *   お (o) - 1st mora\n    *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n    *   う (u) - 3rd mora (This is the second part of the long vowel sound \"ou\")\n    *   と (to) - 4th mora\n    So, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n3.  **Understand the Pitch Accent Patterns:**\n    Let's review the main pitch accent patterns in standard (Tokyo) Japanese, using a four-mora word as an example:\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式, [0]):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles.\n        *   Pronunciation: o(L) to(H) u(H) to(H). If followed by a particle like が (ga), it would be o(L) to(H) u(H) to(H) ga(H).\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式, [1]):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops to low for all subsequent morae.\n        *   Pronunciation: o(H) to(L) u(L) to(L).\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式, [2] or [3]):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word. For a four-mora word, the fall can occur after the second or third mora.\n        *   [2]: o(L) to(H) u(L) to(L). (The peak is on the second mora).\n        *   [3]: o(L) to(H) u(H) to(L). (The peak is on the third mora).\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式, [4]):** The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high until the last mora. The pitch drop occurs on a following particle.\n        *   Pronunciation: o(L) to(H) u(H) to(H). If followed by a particle like が (ga), it would be o(L) to(H) u(H) to(H) ga(L).\n\n4.  **Determine the Specific Pattern for 「弟」 (おとうと):**\n    According to standard Japanese pitch accent dictionaries (such as the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary or OJAD), the word 「おとうと」 is classified with the pitch accent number [0].\n\n5.  **Match the Number to the Pattern Name:**\n    The [0] pitch accent pattern corresponds to **Heiban (平板式)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The pitch pattern for 「おとうと」 is Heiban. The pronunciation is お(L)とうと(H). The pitch starts low on 「お」, rises on 「と」, and stays high for the rest of the word.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Mora vs. Syllable:** Be careful to count morae, not syllables. The long vowel 「おう」 (ou) in 「おとうと」 consists of two morae (お+う), not one.\n*   **Standard Japanese:** The question specifies the *standard* pattern, which is based on the Tokyo dialect. Pitch accent can vary significantly in other dialects.\n*   **Notation:** The number in brackets, e.g., [0], [1], [4], is a common way to denote pitch accent. [0] always means Heiban. For other patterns, the number indicates the mora *after which* the pitch drops.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
