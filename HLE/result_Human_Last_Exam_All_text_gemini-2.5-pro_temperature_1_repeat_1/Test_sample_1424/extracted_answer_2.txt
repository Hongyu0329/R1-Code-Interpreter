The functional dependence is given by the expression $G_0(\omega, \mathbf{k}) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta}$, where $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mathbf{k}$ is the momentum (or other relevant quantum numbers), and $i\delta$ is an infinitesimal term ensuring causality. The single-particle energy $\epsilon_k$ determines the position of the pole of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane.
