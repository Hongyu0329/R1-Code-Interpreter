    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Core Question\nThe first step is to understand what the riddle is asking for. The prompt states, \"The title is a question\".\n*   **Title:** \"The Bays\"\n*   **Pun:** The title is a homophonic pun. \"The Bays\" sounds like \"The B's\".\n*   **Question:** Therefore, the underlying question is, \"What are the B's?\". The haiku must contain clues to identify three things that start with the letter 'B'.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Haiku for Clues\nThe haiku's lines provide the clues to find the three 'B' words. The poem has a consistent theme of wind and storms.\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** A \"tempest\" is a violent, windy storm. We are looking for a 'B' word related to this.\n    *   **Analysis:** A strong, sudden gust of wind can be called a **Blow**. This word fits the context of a tempest and starts with 'B'.\n\n*   **Clue 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line contains a numerical clue and a thematic clue.\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" mathematically translates to `2 * 15 = 30`. The phrase \"winds of change\" directs us to interpret this number in the context of wind. The Beaufort wind scale is a standard measure for wind speed. A wind of approximately 30 mph is classified as a Force 6 \"Strong **Breeze**\". This fits the number, the wind theme, and the 'B' requirement.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This clue points towards a mythological or god-like figure related to the theme.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need a \"divine one\" (a god or spirit) who \"yields\" (produces or provides) wind, whose name begins with 'B'. In Greek mythology, **Boreas** is the god of the North Wind. He is a divine figure who yields wind, perfectly matching the clue.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesizing and Ordering the Answer\nThe three 'B' words identified from the haiku are:\n1.  Blow\n2.  Breeze\n3.  Boreas\n\nThe final instruction is to provide the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n1.  **B**low\n2.  **B**oreas\n3.  **B**reeze\n\nComparing the second letters (l, o, r): 'l' comes before 'o', and 'o' comes before 'r'.\nThe correct alphabetical order is: **Blow, Boreas, Breeze**.\n\n<<<Blow, Boreas, Breeze>>>"
