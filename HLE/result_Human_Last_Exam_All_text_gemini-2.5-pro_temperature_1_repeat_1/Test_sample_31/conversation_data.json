    "On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, when solving using the CFOP method, the final step is PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer). At this stage, the top face (all yellow stickers) is complete, and we only need to permute the last layer pieces (4 corners and 4 edges) into their correct positions. This is done by recognizing the permutation pattern from the 21 possible PLL cases. The pattern is determined by observing the \"side stickers\" of the top layer pieces – that is, the non-top-facing stickers.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of these stickers one must see to identify the case fully.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core of the Problem\n\nThe question asks for the *minimum* number of stickers that must be seen to *uniquely* identify any given PLL case. This means we are looking for the smallest number of stickers that can distinguish any one case from the other 20. This number will be determined by the \"worst-case scenario\" – that is, the number of stickers required to distinguish between the most similar-looking PLL cases.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Most Difficult Cases to Distinguish\n\nThe 21 PLL cases can be grouped by their characteristics. Some are very distinct (e.g., H-perm, which swaps opposite edges), while others are very similar. The most notoriously similar cases are the four **G-perms** (commonly named Ga, Gb, Gc, Gd).\n\n*   All four G-perms permute 3 corners and 3 edges.\n*   All four G-perms have exactly one pair of \"headlights\". Headlights are a pair of corner pieces on the same face that show the same color on that face.\n\nBecause all four G-perms share these core features, distinguishing them requires observing more subtle patterns. Therefore, the minimum number of stickers required for all PLLs will be the number of stickers required to differentiate these four G-perms.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Information Needed to Distinguish G-Perms\n\nA standard and reliable method for recognizing G-perms involves two parts:\n1.  **Locate the headlights:** First, you find the face that has the pair of headlights. Seeing these two corner stickers confirms the case has headlights. This requires observing **2 stickers**.\n2.  **Observe the opposite face:** Once the headlights are found (let's orient them to the 'back' face), you look at the three stickers on the opposite ('front') face. These are the side-stickers of the front-left corner, the front edge, and the front-right corner. The pattern formed by these three stickers is unique for each of the four G-perms. For example (using a common recognition system):\n    *   One G-perm will show a 1x2 \"block\" on the left (the corner and edge stickers match).\n    *   Another will show a 1x2 \"block\" on the right.\n    *   A third will show a \"bar\" (the two corner stickers match).\n    *   The fourth has a different, unique pattern.\n\nTo check for these blocks and bars, you must be able to see all **3 stickers** on this front face.\n\nCombining these two steps, the number of stickers needed for this recognition method is 2 (for the headlights) + 3 (for the opposite face) = **5 stickers**.\n\n### Step 4: Proving That Fewer Than 5 Stickers is Insufficient\n\nTo prove that 5 is truly the minimum, we must show that 4 stickers are not enough. We can do this by finding a scenario where two different PLL cases present the exact same 4-sticker pattern, creating ambiguity.\n\nLet's test the scenario where we see the **2 headlight stickers** on the back face and the **2 corner stickers** on the front face (a total of 4 stickers). Through careful case analysis (permutations can be verified on resources like algdb.net), it can be shown that at least two different G-perms (e.g., Ga and Gc, depending on the algorithm set and orientation) produce the *exact same pattern* on these 4 stickers. The ambiguity between them is only resolved by looking at the front **edge** sticker—which is the 5th sticker.\n\nSince there exists a situation where 4 observed stickers are not enough to make a unique identification, the minimum number required must be greater than 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   We have established that a set of **5 stickers** (2 for headlights, 3 for the opposite face) is sufficient to distinguish the most difficult PLL cases.\n*   We have also established that **4 stickers** are not always sufficient, as ambiguities can exist between very similar cases like the G-perms.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify any PLL case is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
