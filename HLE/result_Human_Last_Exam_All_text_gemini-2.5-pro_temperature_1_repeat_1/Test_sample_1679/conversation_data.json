    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their locations.**\nThere are two ancient Luxor Obelisks. To answer the question, we need to find a film that depicts either of them.\n*   One obelisk remains at its original location, standing at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second obelisk was gifted to France in 1833 and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\nThis means we must search for Best Picture winners set in either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris, France, and specifically check for scenes depicting these landmarks.\n\n**Step 2: Review Best Picture winners chronologically for settings in Egypt.**\nWe will examine the list of winners starting from the first award ceremony.\n*   A review of the Best Picture winners from the 1st Academy Awards (1927/1928) through the 1950s reveals no films set in or featuring scenes in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   Later winners like *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962) have scenes in Egypt, but in Cairo, not Luxor. *Death on the Nile* (1978), which prominently features the Luxor Temple, was not a Best Picture winner.\n*   Therefore, the first depiction is highly unlikely to be the obelisk located in Egypt.\n\n**Step 3: Review Best Picture winners chronologically for settings in Paris.**\nWe will now focus on the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde, Paris.\n*   **1st Awards (1927/1928): *Wings***. This film has scenes set in Paris during World War I. However, these scenes focus on soldiers celebrating in cafes and streets and do not feature a clear shot of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n*   **10th Awards (1937): *The Life of Emile Zola***. This biopic is set in Paris. While the city is the backdrop, the film's narrative action primarily takes place in interiors like courtrooms, newspaper offices, and homes. There are no prominent or confirmed scenes that depict the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **24th Awards (1951): *An American in Paris***. As the title suggests, this musical is a celebration of the city of Paris. The film's famous 17-minute closing ballet sequence is a journey through stylized versions of Parisian landmarks. In this sequence, there is a distinct and memorable scene set in a recreation of the Place de la Concorde, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron dance around the fountains with the Luxor Obelisk clearly depicted in the center.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the findings.**\nNo Best Picture winner prior to 1951 contains a confirmed depiction of the obelisk in Luxor, Egypt. While two earlier winners were partially or wholly set in Paris, neither features a clear depiction of the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde. *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner to explicitly and famously depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
