The way to fix the bad luck is to go to the Pisa Cathedral, located in the same square (Piazza dei Miracoli). On the central bronze door, hidden amongst the intricate biblical scenes, there is a small sculpture of a lizard. The student must find and touch this lizard to reverse the jinx and bring good luck to their studies.
