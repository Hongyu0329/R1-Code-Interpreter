    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of stable curves of genus 4 whose Jacobians have good reduction. This analysis combines principles from algebraic geometry, specifically the theory of stable reduction of curves and Néron models of Jacobians, with a combinatorial classification of labeled trees.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the condition \"Jacobian has good reduction\"**\nLet $C$ be a curve of genus $g=4$ defined over a valuation field $K$. The Jacobian of $C$, denoted $J(C)$, is an abelian variety of dimension 4. The statement that $J(C)$ has good reduction means that its Néron model over the valuation ring $R$ of $K$ is an abelian scheme.\n\nA key theorem by Deligne, Mumford, and Rapoport connects the stable reduction of the curve $C$ to the reduction of its Jacobian. Let $X_k$ be the special fiber of the stable model of $C$. $X_k$ is a stable curve of arithmetic genus $p_a(X_k)=4$. The condition that $J(C)$ has good reduction implies that the generalized Jacobian of $X_k$, denoted $J(X_k)$, is an abelian variety.\n\nThe generalized Jacobian $J(X_k)$ of a nodal curve $X_k$ fits into an exact sequence:\n$0 \\to T \\to J(X_k) \\to A \\to 0$\nwhere $T$ is an algebraic torus $(k^*)^r$ and $A$ is an abelian variety (the product of the Jacobians of the irreducible components of $X_k$). The rank $r$ of the torus is the first Betti number of the dual graph $\\Gamma$ of $X_k$. The dual graph has vertices for the irreducible components and edges for the nodes connecting them.\n\nFor $J(X_k)$ to be an abelian variety, the torus part $T$ must be trivial, which means its rank $r$ must be 0. For a connected graph $\\Gamma$, $r=0$ means that $\\Gamma$ is a tree.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the arithmetic genus to the geometric genera of components**\nThe arithmetic genus $p_a(X_k)$ of a nodal curve is given by the formula:\n$p_a(X_k) = \\sum_{i} g_i + r$\nwhere $g_i$ is the geometric genus of the $i$-th irreducible component, and $r$ is the first Betti number of the dual graph.\nSince we are given $p_a(X_k)=4$ and we've deduced $r=0$, the formula simplifies to:\n$\\sum_{i} g_i = 4$\nThis means the sum of the geometric genera of the irreducible components of the stable reduction must be exactly 4.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the stability condition**\nA stable curve is a connected nodal curve where every smooth rational component (a component of genus 0, i.e., $\\mathbb{P}^1$) must intersect the other components in at least 3 points. In terms of the dual graph, this means any vertex corresponding to a genus 0 component must have a degree of at least 3.\n\n**Step 4: Combinatorial Classification**\nThe problem is now reduced to a combinatorial one: find the number of non-isomorphic labeled trees $(\\Gamma, g)$ where:\n1.  $\\Gamma$ is a tree.\n2.  The vertices of $\\Gamma$ are labeled by non-negative integers $g_i$ (the genera).\n3.  The sum of the labels is $\\sum g_i = 4$.\n4.  Any vertex labeled with genus 0 must have a degree of at least 3.\n\nWe can classify these trees by the number of genus 0 components, denoted by $k$.\n\n**Case 1: No genus 0 components ($k=0$)**\nThe genera $g_i$ are all positive integers that sum to 4. We list the partitions of 4 into positive integers and the corresponding tree structures.\n*   **Partition (4):** One component of genus 4. The graph is a single vertex. This is a smooth curve of genus 4. (1 type)\n*   **Partition (3,1):** A genus 3 curve and a genus 1 curve. The tree has 2 vertices, so it's a path $P_2$. They meet at one node. (1 type)\n*   **Partition (2,2):** Two genus 2 curves meeting at one node. The tree is $P_2$. (1 type)\n*   **Partition (2,1,1):** One genus 2 and two genus 1 components. The tree has 3 vertices, which must be a path $P_3$. There are two distinct labelings:\n    *   The central component has genus 2: (g=1)---(g=2)---(g=1).\n    *   The central component has genus 1: (g=2)---(g=1)---(g=1). (Note that this is the same as (g=1)---(g=1)---(g=2)).\n    (2 types)\n*   **Partition (1,1,1,1):** Four genus 1 components. The tree has 4 vertices. There are two non-isomorphic trees on 4 vertices:\n    *   The path graph $P_4$: (g=1)---(g=1)---(g=1)---(g=1).\n    *   The star graph $K_{1,3}$: A central genus 1 curve attached to three other genus 1 curves.\n    (2 types)\nTotal for $k=0$: $1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7$ types.\n\n**Case 2: One genus 0 component ($k=1$)**\nThe tree must have a vertex of degree $\\ge 3$. This requires the tree to have at least 4 vertices.\n*   **Partition (2,1,1,0):** Four components. The tree must be the star graph $K_{1,3}$ for the degree condition to hold for a 4-vertex tree. The genus 0 component must be the central vertex (degree 3). The leaves are the components of genus 2, 1, and 1. (1 type)\n*   **Partition (1,1,1,1,0):** Five components. The tree must have 5 vertices, and the genus 0 component must be at a vertex with degree $\\ge 3$. There are two such trees:\n    *   The star graph $K_{1,4}$: The genus 0 component is the central vertex (degree 4), connected to four genus 1 components.\n    *   The \"Y-shape\" tree (degree sequence 3,2,1,1,1): The genus 0 component is the vertex of degree 3. The other four components have genus 1, arranged with one forming a \"tail\" of length 2.\n    (2 types)\nTotal for $k=1$: $1 + 2 = 3$ types.\n\n**Case 3: Two genus 0 components ($k=2$)**\nThe tree must have two vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. The sum of degrees in a tree with $n$ vertices is $2(n-1)$. The condition that two vertices have degree $\\ge 3$ and the other $n-2$ vertices have degree $\\ge 1$ leads to the inequality $n \\ge 6$.\n*   **Partition (1,1,1,1,0,0):** Six components in total ($n=6$). We need a tree on 6 vertices with two vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. This forces the degree sequence to be (3,3,1,1,1,1). The two genus 0 components must be the vertices of degree 3, and the four genus 1 components must be the leaves. There is only one such tree structure up to isomorphism: two central vertices are connected, and each has two leaves attached. (1 type)\n\n**Case 4: Three or more genus 0 components ($k \\ge 3$)**\nFor $k$ components of genus 0, the tree must have $k$ vertices of degree $\\ge 3$. This implies the total number of vertices $n$ must satisfy $n \\ge 2k+2$.\n*   For $k=3$, we need $n \\ge 8$. This would mean we need to partition 4 into $m=n-k \\ge 5$ positive integers, which is impossible.\n*   For $k \\ge 3$, this is not possible.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSumming up the number of types from all possible cases:\n*   $k=0$: 7 types\n*   $k=1$: 3 types\n*   $k=2$: 1 type\nThe total number of types of stable reductions is $7 + 3 + 1 = 11$."
