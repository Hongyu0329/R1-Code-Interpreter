To be functionally accurate, the table must change its physical shape. When the sun rises, its UV light should cause the table to transform from its stable, linear (trans) form into a bent, V-shape (cis) form. When the sun sets and the UV light is gone, the table must revert back to its stable, linear (trans) form.
