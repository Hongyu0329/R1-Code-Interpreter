No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is primarily because the common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, and this crystal symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC. Additionally, their metallic nature makes them highly absorptive, which is unsuitable for an efficient downconversion process.
