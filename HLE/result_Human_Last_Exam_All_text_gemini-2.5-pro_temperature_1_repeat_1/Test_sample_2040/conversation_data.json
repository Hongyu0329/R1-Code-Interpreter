    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\nSPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In its simplest form, a high-energy \"pump\" photon passes through a suitable nonlinear optical medium and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons, conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. This process must conserve both energy and momentum. The key takeaway here is that SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical effect**. Its efficiency is determined by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Material Requirement for SPDC**\n\nFor a material to exhibit a second-order nonlinear optical response (i.e., to have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$), it must possess a specific crystal structure. The fundamental requirement is that the material must be **non-centrosymmetric**. This means its crystal lattice must lack a center of inversion symmetry. In a centrosymmetric material, the symmetry rules forbid any bulk second-order nonlinear effects, including SPDC, in the electric dipole approximation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Properties of Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\nNow we must examine the properties of the material in question, free-standing boron nanosheets.\n\n*   **Crystal Structure:** Boron nanosheets, or borophene, are known to be polymorphic, meaning they can exist in several different atomic arrangements (phases). However, the most commonly synthesized and theoretically stable phases, such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, are **centrosymmetric**. They possess a center of inversion symmetry.\n*   **Electronic Properties:** Most known phases of borophene are **metallic**. This means they have no band gap and contain a high density of free electrons.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Material Properties with the Phenomenon's Requirements**\n\nWe can now connect the properties of borophene to the requirements for SPDC.\n\n1.  **Symmetry Argument (Primary Reason):** Since the common, stable phases of free-standing borophene are centrosymmetric, their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$, is zero due to symmetry. As SPDC is a $\\chi^{(2)}$ process, it is fundamentally forbidden in the bulk of these nanosheets.\n\n2.  **Electronic Property Argument (Secondary Reason):** Even if a non-centrosymmetric phase of borophene existed, its metallic nature would make it a very poor candidate for SPDC. The high density of free carriers leads to strong linear absorption across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This high absorption would mean that the pump photons would be absorbed rather than down-converted, and any signal/idler photons that were generated would be quickly re-absorbed by the material. Efficient SPDC requires a material that is highly transparent at the pump, signal, and idler wavelengths, which is why wide-bandgap dielectric crystals (like BBO or LiNbO₃) are typically used.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Symmetry is the Deciding Factor:** The most important point is the crystal symmetry. The centrosymmetric nature of common borophene phases is the primary reason why SPDC is not expected.\n2.  **\"Free-standing\" is a Key Qualifier:** If the borophene were on a substrate, the overall system (borophene + substrate) could lack inversion symmetry, potentially allowing for an interface-driven second-order effect. The question's focus on \"free-standing\" removes this possibility and restricts the analysis to the intrinsic properties of the nanosheet itself.\n3.  **Metallic Nature is a Major Practical Barrier:** The metallic character of borophene is a strong secondary reason. High absorption and free-carrier screening are highly detrimental to nonlinear optical processes like SPDC, which rely on the interaction of light with bound electrons in a transparent medium.\n4.  **Bulk vs. Edge Effects:** While the bulk (the 2D plane) of the nanosheet is centrosymmetric, inversion symmetry is necessarily broken at the edges. In principle, a very weak, edge-localized SPDC signal might be possible, but this would not be a characteristic property of the material as a whole and would be extremely inefficient. The question is about the material's general expected behavior.\n5.  **Polymorphism:** While the known stable phases are centrosymmetric, the existence of a hypothetical, stable, non-centrosymmetric borophene phase cannot be completely ruled out for the future. However, based on current scientific understanding, the expectation is for centrosymmetric structures.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The primary reason is that the common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, which forbids second-order nonlinear optical effects like SPDC by the rules of symmetry. A secondary, but also critical, reason is that their metallic nature would lead to high optical losses, preventing an efficient SPDC process even if it were symmetry-allowed.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is primarily because the common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, and this crystal symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC. Additionally, their metallic nature makes them highly absorptive, which is unsuitable for an efficient downconversion process.>>>"
