    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Tank:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 identical vertices where 5 faces meet at each vertex.\n*   **The Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, there is another identical triangular face at the very top, parallel to the base.\n*   **The Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This refers to the volume. The volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Water Surface**\n*   A regular icosahedron is a centrally symmetric object. This means it has a geometric center, and for any point within the icosahedron, the point diametrically opposite through the center is also within the icosahedron.\n*   A key property of centrally symmetric objects is that any plane passing through the center divides the object's volume into two equal halves.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled by volume, the water surface must be a plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n*   As the tank is standing on a horizontal face, the water surface will be a horizontal plane. Therefore, the water surface is the horizontal plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Water Surface**\n*   The problem now becomes a question of geometry: What is the shape of the cross-section formed by slicing an icosahedron with a plane that passes through its center and is parallel to one of its faces?\n*   We can determine this shape by considering the symmetries of the setup.\n    *   **Rotational Symmetry:** Since the icosahedron stands on a triangular face, the vertical axis (perpendicular to the base) is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Any horizontal cross-section, including the water surface, must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry. This means the shape could be a triangle, a hexagon, a nonagon, etc.\n    *   **Inversion Symmetry:** The slicing plane passes through the center of inversion of the icosahedron. This means the resulting cross-sectional shape must also be centrally symmetric. A triangle is not centrally symmetric. A regular hexagon is. A regular nonagon is not.\n*   Combining these symmetry requirements strongly suggests the shape is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm with Duality (A more rigorous method)**\n*   There is a concept in geometry called duality. The dual of a regular icosahedron is a regular dodecahedron (which has 12 pentagonal faces and 20 vertices).\n*   There is a direct correspondence:\n    *   The faces of the icosahedron correspond to the vertices of the dodecahedron.\n    *   The vertices of the icosahedron correspond to the faces of the dodecahedron.\n*   Our icosahedron is oriented on a face. This is dual to a dodecahedron oriented on a vertex (i.e., with a vertical axis passing through two opposite vertices).\n*   Our slicing plane is parallel to a face of the icosahedron and passes through its center. This is dual to a slicing plane that is perpendicular to the vertex-axis of the dodecahedron and passes through its center.\n*   It is a known geometric fact that the cross-section of a dodecahedron, when sliced by a plane through its center and perpendicular to an axis connecting two opposite vertices, is a **regular hexagon**.\n*   Therefore, by duality, the cross-section of an icosahedron sliced by a plane through its center and parallel to a face is also a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe water fills the icosahedron up to its central plane. The shape of this horizontal cross-section at the center of the icosahedron is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
