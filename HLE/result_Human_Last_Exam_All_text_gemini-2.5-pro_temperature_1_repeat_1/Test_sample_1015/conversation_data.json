    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core movement: Cambré Derrière**\nA \"cambré\" is a bend of the body from the waist, and \"derrière\" means to the back. So, a cambré derrière is a backbend. In classical ballet, this is a fundamental movement executed with specific technique and control. It involves bending the upper torso backward, originating from the upper spine, while the lower body remains stable.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Founder:** Agrippina Vaganova (Russian).\n*   **Core Principles:** Emphasis on core strength, precise alignment, and building movement from a strong, stable center. It is known for its logical and methodical progression.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Hips:** The absolute rule in the Vaganova method is that the hips must remain perfectly square and directly over the supporting legs. The pelvis is kept in a neutral position, and the dancer is taught not to push the hips forward. This is often described as \"lifting up and over\" an imaginary object behind you.\n    *   **Initiation:** The bend originates from the upper back (thoracic spine), lifting the sternum towards the ceiling first, before arching back. The lower back is supported and elongated, not crunched.\n    *   **Result:** This technique produces a pure, clean line where the bend is clearly articulated in the upper spine. The degree of the bend is determined by the dancer's spinal flexibility while maintaining strict pelvic alignment.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Founder:** George Balanchine (Georgian-American).\n*   **Core Principles:** Emphasis on speed, musicality, dynamic movement, and creating long, extended lines. Balanchine often modified classical technique to achieve a specific aesthetic or to facilitate faster, more complex choreography.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Hips:** This is the key point of divergence. In the Balanchine style, the dancer is often encouraged to press the hips forward, moving them past the alignment of the feet. This is sometimes called a \"broken line\" at the hip.\n    *   **Initiation:** The movement is often larger and more expansive.\n    *   **Result:** Pushing the hips forward allows the dancer to achieve a much deeper and more dramatic C-shaped curve with their entire body. This creates a visually striking line that emphasizes extremity and length, but it sacrifices the strict alignment prized in the Vaganova method.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods and evaluate the answer choices**\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there can be stylistic differences in the arms, it is not the defining technical difference between the two methods for this specific step.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant and fundamental difference. Vaganova insists on hips stacked over the feet (no forward push). Balanchine allows or encourages the hips to push forward. This is the core technical distinction.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is famously fast, the speed of a single movement like a cambré is not the defining difference in technique. A cambré can be performed slowly or quickly in either style depending on the exercise or context.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The difference in the degree of the backbend is a *result* of the difference in hip placement. The Balanchine method achieves a deeper bend *because* the hips are allowed to move forward. Therefore, the hip placement is the root cause, making it a more precise and fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head generally follows the line of the spine. The difference in how far back the head travels is, like the degree of the bend, a consequence of the hip placement and overall spinal curve, not the primary difference itself.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most accurate and fundamental distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the alignment and placement of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
