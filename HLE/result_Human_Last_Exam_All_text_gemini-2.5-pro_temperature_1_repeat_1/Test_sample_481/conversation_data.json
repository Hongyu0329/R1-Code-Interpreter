    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the numerical imprints on the specified capsules.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the specific numbers printed on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for two different strengths: 10mg and 20mg.\n\n2.  **Establish Constraints:** The analysis must strictly exclude any information about capsule color, the word \"PLIVA,\" and differences in capsule size. The focus is solely on the numerical markings.\n\n3.  **Research the 10mg Capsule:** Using official drug identification resources, we look for the imprint on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule. The standard imprint for this capsule is \"PLIVA 647\".\n\n4.  **Apply Constraints to the 10mg Capsule:** The instructions state to ignore the word \"PLIVA\". After removing this word, the remaining imprint is the number **647**.\n\n5.  **Research the 20mg Capsule:** We perform a similar search for the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule. Research shows that Teva has manufactured this dosage with at least two different imprints.\n    *   One version is imprinted with \"TEVA 3105\".\n    *   Another version, often associated with Teva's acquisition of Pliva, is imprinted with \"PLIVA 443\".\n\n6.  **Apply Constraints to the 20mg Capsules:**\n    *   For the \"TEVA 3105\" imprint, we disregard the brand name \"TEVA\" (in the same spirit as ignoring \"PLIVA\"), which leaves the number **3105**.\n    *   For the \"PLIVA 443\" imprint, we disregard the word \"PLIVA\" as instructed, which leaves the number **443**.\n\n7.  **Final Comparison:** By comparing the numerical imprints, we can conclude the following:\n    *   The 10mg capsule has the number **647**.\n    *   The 20mg capsules have the numbers **3105** and **443**.\n\nTherefore, the different numbers imprinted on the capsules are 647 for the 10mg strength, and 3105 or 443 for the 20mg strength.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 647, while the 20mg capsules are imprinted with the numbers 3105 or 443.>>>"
