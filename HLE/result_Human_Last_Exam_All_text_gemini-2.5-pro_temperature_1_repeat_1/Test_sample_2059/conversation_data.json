    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of the polynomial and its coefficients**\n\nThe polynomial $P(x)$ is defined as a product of 20 terms:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\nThis polynomial can be expanded into the standard form $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$, where $a_k$ are the coefficients.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the quantity to be calculated**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of the sum of the squares of the coefficients, which is $S = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the sum of squares of coefficients to the polynomial**\n\nA key identity for a polynomial $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$ is that the sum of the squares of its coefficients, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, is the constant term of the Laurent polynomial $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\nLet's verify this.\n$P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\dots$\n$P(x^{-1}) = a_0 + a_1 x^{-1} + a_2 x^{-2} + \\dots$\nThe product is:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\sum_j a_j x^j\\right) \\left(\\sum_k a_k x^{-k}\\right) = \\sum_{j,k} a_j a_k x^{j-k}$\nThe constant term in this expansion is the coefficient of $x^0$, which occurs when the exponent $j-k=0$, i.e., $j=k$. The sum of these terms is $\\sum_k a_k a_k = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\n**Step 4: Express $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ using the product definition of $P(x)$**\n\nLet's denote the individual factors in the product for $P(x)$ as $Q_i(x)$:\n$Q_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$\nSo, $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x)$.\nThen, $P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x^{-1})$.\nThe product we are interested in is:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x^{-1})\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left(Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1})\\right)$\n\n**Step 5: Find the constant term of the product**\n\nA fundamental property of polynomials (and Laurent polynomials) is that the constant term of a product is the product of the constant terms of the individual factors.\nLet $C_0(F)$ denote the constant term of a polynomial $F(x)$.\n$C_0(P(x)P(x^{-1})) = C_0\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1})\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} C_0\\left(Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1})\\right)$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the constant term for each factor $Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1})$**\n\nFor each $i$ from 0 to 19, we need to find the constant term of the product:\n$Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1}) = \\left(1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\left(1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n\nTo find the constant term of this product, we identify pairs of terms, one from each parenthesis, whose exponents add up to zero.\n1.  (1 from the first parenthesis) $\\times$ (1 from the second parenthesis) = $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n2.  ($x^{3^i}$ from the first) $\\times$ ($x^{-3^i}$ from the second) = $x^{3^i-3^i} = x^0 = 1$.\n3.  ($x^{2\\cdot 3^i}$ from the first) $\\times$ ($x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}$ from the second) = $x^{2\\cdot 3^i - 2\\cdot 3^i} = x^0 = 1$.\n4.  ($x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$ from the first) $\\times$ ($x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}$ from the second) = $x^{3\\cdot 3^i - 3\\cdot 3^i} = x^0 = 1$.\n\nThe constant term of $Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1})$ is the sum of these products: $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\nThis is true for every $i$ from 0 to 19.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final result**\n\nNow we can compute the constant term of the full product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$:\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = C_0(P(x)P(x^{-1})) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} C_0(Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1})) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4$.\n\nThe product consists of 20 identical terms (since $i$ ranges from 0 to 19, inclusive).\nSo, the result is $4^{20}$.\n\n**Step 8: Simplify the final answer**\n\nThe value can be expressed as a power of 2:\n$4^{20} = (2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The core of the solution is the identity $\\sum_k a_k^2 = C_0(P(x)P(x^{-1}))$. Without this, the problem is much harder.\n*   It is important to correctly identify the number of terms in the product $\\prod_{i=0}^{19}$, which is $19 - 0 + 1 = 20$. A common mistake is to assume it is 19.\n*   The calculation of the constant term for each $Q_i(x)Q_i(x^{-1})$ is straightforward but must be done carefully. Each of the four terms in $Q_i(x)$ has a unique multiplicative inverse in $Q_i(x^{-1})$, leading to a constant term of 4.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe sum of squares of coefficients is $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = \\text{Constant term of } P(x)P(x^{-1})$\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left( (1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i})(1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}) \\right)$\nThe constant term of the product is the product of the constant terms.\nThe constant term of $(1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i})(1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i})$ is $1\\cdot 1 + 1\\cdot 1 + 1\\cdot 1 + 1\\cdot 1 = 4$.\nSo, $\\sum_k a_k^2 = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4 = 4^{20} = 2^{40}$.\n\n<<<4^{20}>>>"
