    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Representation of Numbers in Red-Blue Hackenbush\n\nIn Red-Blue Hackenbush, game positions can have numerical values. The numbers that can be represented by a finite number of pieces are the dyadic rationals, which are fractions of the form $\\frac{m}{2^k}$ where *m* and *k* are integers. The question asks for the number of pieces in the canonical representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$, which is the simplest and most standard form of the game for this value.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Number Using Binary Expansion\n\nThe canonical way to represent a dyadic rational is to first decompose it into a sum of powers of 2. This is equivalent to finding its binary representation.\n\nThe number is $\\frac{13}{16}$. Let's convert this to binary:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nIn terms of powers of two:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = 2^{-1} + 2^{-2} + 2^{-4}$\n\nThe binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ is therefore $0.1101_2$.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Principle of Game Sums\n\nA fundamental principle in combinatorial game theory is that the game for a sum of values is the disjoint sum of the games for each individual value. This means the game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ is composed of three separate, unconnected game structures, one for each term in its binary expansion:\n*   A game for the value $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n*   A game for the value $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n*   A game for the value $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is the sum of the pieces required for each of these component games.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structure and Piece Count for Each Component Game\n\nThere is a standard canonical game for any value of the form $\\frac{1}{2^k}$.\nThe game for the value $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ (where $k \\ge 1$) consists of a single stack of $k+1$ pieces:\n*   $k$ blue pieces form the base of the stack.\n*   1 red piece sits at the very top.\n\nLet's use this rule to find the number of pieces for each component of $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{2}$:**\n    Here, $k=1$. The game consists of 1 blue piece and 1 red piece on top.\n    Number of pieces = $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{4}$:**\n    Here, $k=2$. The game consists of 2 blue pieces and 1 red piece on top.\n    Number of pieces = $2 + 1 = 3$.\n\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{16}$:**\n    Here, $k=4$. The game consists of 4 blue pieces and 1 red piece on top.\n    Number of pieces = $4 + 1 = 5$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Pieces\n\nFinally, we sum the number of pieces from each of the three disjoint game structures.\n\nTotal Pieces = (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{2}$) + (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{4}$) + (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{16}$)\nTotal Pieces = $2 + 3 + 5$\nTotal Pieces = $10$\n\nThus, 10 pieces are needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush.\n\n<<<10>>>"
