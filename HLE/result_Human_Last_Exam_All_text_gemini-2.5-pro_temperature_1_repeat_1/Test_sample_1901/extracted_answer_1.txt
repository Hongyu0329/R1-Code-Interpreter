The proposed design correctly identifies the general principles for creating a calamitic (rod-like) liquid crystal: a rigid core with terminal groups at para-positions, including a flexible alkyl chain and a polar headgroup. However, the specific choice of a single benzene ring as the entire rigid core is a critical flaw. A molecule like 4-pentylbenzonitrile (C5H11-Ph-CN) lacks sufficient molecular anisotropy (length-to-breadth ratio). The intermolecular forces are too weak to sustain a liquid crystal phase at room temperature; its actual nematic-isotropic transition is far below 0째C (around -23째C). Therefore, the proposed tuning strategy of simply adjusting the alkyl chain length is ineffective for achieving the target temperature range. A successful design that meets the criteria would require increasing the core's anisotropy while retaining only one benzene ring. This can be accomplished by attaching a non-aromatic, rigid unit like a cyclohexane ring. A well-known example that fits the requirements is 4-(trans-4-pentylcyclohexyl)benzonitrile (PCH-5), which has a nematic phase in the 30째C to 55째C range.
