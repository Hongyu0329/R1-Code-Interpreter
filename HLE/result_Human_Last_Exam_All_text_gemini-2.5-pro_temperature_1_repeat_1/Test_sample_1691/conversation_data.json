    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to develop the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nWe are looking for an approximation for small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Integrand and Identify the Dominant Region\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$.\nFor small $\\epsilon$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{D(x, \\epsilon)}$ becomes very large if the term $g(x)$ is very small. This means the main contribution to the integral comes from the region of $x$ where $g(x)$ is at its minimum.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Find the minimum of g(x) on the interval [0, 15].**\nTo find the minimum, we first compute the derivative of $g(x)$:\n$g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8) = 45x^4 + 30x^5 + 72x^7$\nWe can factor out $x^4$:\n$g'(x) = x^4(45 + 30x + 72x^3)$\nFor $x > 0$ in the interval $[0, 15]$, all terms in the parenthesis are positive, so $g'(x) > 0$. This means that $g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function for $x > 0$.\nThe minimum value of $g(x)$ on the interval $[0, 15]$ must therefore occur at the left endpoint, $x=0$.\nThe minimum value is $g(0) = 0$.\n\nSince the minimum of $g(x)$ is zero, the denominator becomes $\\epsilon$ at $x=0$, and the integrand value is $1/\\epsilon$, which tends to infinity as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. This confirms that the behavior of the integral is dominated by the region near $x=0$. This is a singular perturbation problem.\n\n### Step 2: Approximate the Function in the Dominant Region\nNear the dominant point $x=0$, we can approximate $g(x)$ by its Taylor series expansion around $x=0$.\n$g(x) = g(0) + g'(0)x + \\frac{g''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \\dots$\nFrom the expression $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$, it is already in the form of a Maclaurin series. For small $x$, the lowest power of $x$ dominates.\n$g(x) \\approx 9x^5$ for $x \\to 0$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Justify the approximation.**\nThe dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region where $\\epsilon + g(x)$ is small, which is when $g(x) \\sim O(\\epsilon)$. Using our approximation, this means $9x^5 \\sim O(\\epsilon)$, or $x \\sim O(\\epsilon^{1/5})$. For small $\\epsilon$, this value of $x$ is small. In this region, the higher-order terms are much smaller:\n$5x^6 \\sim 5(\\epsilon^{1/5})^6 = 5\\epsilon^{6/5}$\n$9x^8 \\sim 9(\\epsilon^{1/5})^8 = 9\\epsilon^{8/5}$\nSince $\\epsilon^{6/5} \\ll \\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon^{8/5} \\ll \\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon$, we can safely neglect these terms in the leading-order approximation.\n\nSo, we can approximate the integral as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Approximate Integral\nTo evaluate $I_{approx}(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$, we perform a change of variables.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Adjust the integration limits.**\nThe integrand is large only for very small $x$. For larger $x$, the integrand becomes very small. For instance, at $x=1$, the value is $1/(\\epsilon+9)$, which is small. The characteristic length scale is $x \\sim \\epsilon^{1/5}$. Since $\\epsilon$ is small, this scale is much smaller than the upper limit of 15. Therefore, changing the upper limit from 15 to $\\infty$ will introduce a very small error but will make the integral much easier to evaluate.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\nLet's make the substitution $u^5 = \\frac{9x^5}{\\epsilon}$.\nThis implies $u = (9/\\epsilon)^{1/5} x$, so $x = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u$.\nThe differential is $dx = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} du$.\nThe limits of integration remain $0$ to $\\infty$.\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5} \\left( (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} du \\right)$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon(1 + u^5)} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5} \\cdot 9^{-1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$\n\n### Step 4: Use a Standard Integral Formula\nThe integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^n} du$ is a standard integral.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Apply the correct formula.**\nThe value of this integral is given by the formula involving the Gamma or Beta function, which simplifies to:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^n} du = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$\nIn our case, $n=5$. So, we have:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Final Analytical Formula\nSubstituting the value of the definite integral back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right)$\n\nRearranging the terms gives the final analytical formula for $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\nThis formula shows that the integral diverges as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, with the leading behavior proportional to $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$. The constant of proportionality depends on $\\pi$ and the coefficient of the leading term in $g(x)$.\n\n<<<$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$>>>"
