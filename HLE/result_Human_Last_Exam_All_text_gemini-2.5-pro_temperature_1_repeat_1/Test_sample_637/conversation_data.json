    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to design a state observer for the given discrete-time system such that the estimation error e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k) converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as a deadbeat observer design. The observer is described by:\nx_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))\nwhere L is the observer gain matrix we need to find.\n\nThe error dynamics are given by e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k). For the error to become identically zero after a finite number of steps N, the matrix (A - LC) must be nilpotent, i.e., (A - LC)^N = 0. The \"shortest possible number of steps\" corresponds to the observability index of the system, denoted by ν. We need to find L such that (A - LC)^ν = 0.\n\n**2. Check System Properties**\nFirst, we must determine if a deadbeat observer can be designed, which requires the system to be observable. The observability matrix is O = [C^T, A^T C^T, (A^T)^2 C^T, (A^T)^3 C^T]^T. The system is observable if rank(O) = n, where n is the number of states (n=4).\n\nThe observability index ν is the smallest integer such that the rank of O_ν = [C^T, A^T C^T, ..., (A^T)^(ν-1) C^T]^T is equal to n.\n\n*   **Matrices:**\n    A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1], C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n*   **Step 2a: Compute matrix products needed for the observability matrix.**\n    C = [[1, 0, 0, 0],\n         [1, 0, 0, 1]]\n    CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1],\n          [-2, 0, 1, 0]]\n    CA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2],\n            [2, 1, 0, -3]]\n*   **Step 2b: Determine the observability index ν.**\n    Let's check the rank of O_2 = [C; CA].\n    O_2 = [[1, 0, 0, 0],\n           [1, 0, 0, 1],\n           [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n           [-2, 0, 1, 0]]\n    The rank of O_2 can be found to be 3. Since rank(O_2) < 4, we continue.\n    Let's check the rank of O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2].\n    O_3 = [[1, 0, 0, 0],\n           [1, 0, 0, 1],\n           [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n           [-2, 0, 1, 0],\n           [0, 0, 1, -2],\n           [2, 1, 0, -3]]\n    The rank of O_3 can be found to be 4.\n    Since rank(O_3) = 4 = n, the system is observable and the observability index is ν = 3.\n    This means the error can be driven to zero in 3 steps. We need to find L such that (A - LC)^3 = 0.\n\n**3. Simplify the System Structure**\nThe structure of the C matrix, y1 = x1 and y2 = x1 + x4, implies that we can determine states x1 and x4 directly from the output y. This suggests reordering the state vector to simplify the design.\nLet the new state vector be x_r = [x1, x4, x2, x3]^T. This partitions the state into a directly measured part x_a = [x1, x4]^T and an unmeasured part x_b = [x2, x3]^T.\nThe transformation is x_r = Px, where P is the permutation matrix:\nP = [[1, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 1],\n     [0, 1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 1, 0]]\nThe system matrices in the new coordinates are A_r = PAP^T and C_r = CP^T.\nA_r = [[-1, 1, 0, 0],\n       [-1, -1, 0, 1],\n       [1, 2, 0, 0],\n       [0, -1, 1, 0]]\nC_r = [[1, 0, 0, 0],\n       [1, 1, 0, 0]]\nThis C_r matrix is not of the form [I, 0]. Let's redefine the output so it is simpler. Let y_new = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]] * x_r. This corresponds to knowing x1 and x4. This can be achieved by a linear transformation of the original output y: y_new = T*y where T = [[1,0],[-1,1]]. The observer equation can be written in terms of y_new and a new gain L_new. This path is equivalent to the state-space transformation method.\n\nA more direct way is to notice that y = C x = C P^T x_r.\nThe observer error dynamics in the new coordinates are e_r(k+1) = (A_r - L_r C_r)e_r(k), where e_r = Pe and L = P^T L_r.\nThe C_r matrix still couples the outputs.\nLet's use the original idea of C_r = [I, 0] structure but with a transformed output.\ny' = Ty where T = [[1, 0],[-1, 1]]. y' = [[y1], [y2-y1]] = [[x1], [x4]].\nThe system description with this new output y' is y' = C'x, where C' = TC.\nC' = [[1, 0],[-1, 1]] * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]].\nNow, with this C', the reordered matrix C'_r = C'P^T becomes:\nC'_r = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]] * P^T = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]] = [I_2, 0].\nThe observer equation is x_hat(k+1) = A x_hat(k) + B u(k) + L'(y'(k) - C'x_hat(k)).\nThe error dynamics are e(k+1) = (A-L'C')e(k). We need to find L'. The original gain L can be recovered via L = L'T.\nLet's work in the reordered system with this new output y'.\nA_r = PAP^T = [[-1, 1, 0, 0], [-1, -1, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0, 0], [0, -1, 1, 0]].\nThis can be written in block form: A_r = [[A_aa, A_ab], [A_ba, A_bb]]\nA_aa = [[-1, 1], [-1, -1]], A_ab = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\nA_ba = [[1, 2], [0, -1]],  A_bb = [[0, 0], [1, 0]]\nC'_r = [I, 0].\nThe error dynamics for the reordered system are e_r(k+1) = (A_r - L'_r C'_r)e_r(k).\nL'_r = [L'_a; L'_b].\nA_r - L'_r C'_r = [[A_aa - L'_a, A_ab], [A_ba - L'_b, A_bb]]. Let this be F_r.\n\n**4. Design the Observer Gain**\nWe want to find L'_r such that F_r^3 = 0. We can achieve this by choosing L'_a and L'_b to give F_r a simple nilpotent structure.\n*   **Step 4a: Choose L'_b.** Let's choose L'_b to make the lower-left block zero: L'_b = A_ba.\n    L'_b = [[1, 2], [0, -1]].\n    This makes F_r block upper-triangular: F_r = [[A_aa - L'_a, A_ab], [0, A_bb]].\n*   **Step 4b: Choose L'_a.** Let's choose L'_a to make the upper-left block zero: L'_a = A_aa.\n    L'_a = [[-1, 1], [-1, -1]].\n    This makes F_r = [[0, A_ab], [0, A_bb]].\n*   **Step 4c: Check for nilpotency.** Let's compute powers of this F_r.\n    F_r^2 = F_r * F_r = [[0, A_ab A_bb], [0, A_bb^2]].\n    A_bb^2 = [[0, 0], [1, 0]] * [[0, 0], [1, 0]] = [[0, 0], [0, 0]] = 0.\n    A_ab A_bb = [[0, 0], [0, 1]] * [[0, 0], [1, 0]] = [[0, 0], [1, 0]].\n    So, F_r^2 = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]] which is not the zero matrix.\n    F_r^3 = F_r * F_r^2 = [[0, A_ab], [0, A_bb]] * [[0, A_ab A_bb], [0, 0]] = [[0, 0], [0, 0]] = 0.\n    Since F_r^3 = 0 (and F_r^2 != 0), the error will vanish in exactly 3 steps, which is the shortest possible time.\n\n**5. Compute the Final Gain Matrix L**\nWe found the gain L'_r for the reordered system with the transformed output y'.\nL'_r = [L'_a; L'_b] = [[-1, 1], [-1, -1], [1, 2], [0, -1]].\nThis gain L'_r is for the reordered state [x1, x4, x2, x3]. We must transform it back to the original state order to get L'.\nL' = P^T L'_r.\nP^T = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0]].\nL' = P^T * L'_r = [[-1, 1],\n                   [1, 2],\n                   [0, -1],\n                   [-1, -1]]\nFinally, this gain L' is for the transformed output y'. We need the gain L for the original output y. The relationship is L = L'T.\nT = [[1, 0], [-1, 1]].\nL = L' * T = [[-1, 1], [1, 2], [0, -1], [-1, -1]] * [[1, 0], [-1, 1]]\nL = [[(-1)*1 + 1*(-1), (-1)*0 + 1*1],\n     [1*1 + 2*(-1),   1*0 + 2*1],\n     [0*1 + (-1)*(-1), 0*0 + (-1)*1],\n     [(-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1), (-1)*0 + (-1)*1]]\nL = [[-2, 1],\n     [-1, 2],\n     [1, -1],\n     [0, -1]]\n\nThis is the observer gain matrix that ensures the observation error becomes zero in 3 steps.\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
