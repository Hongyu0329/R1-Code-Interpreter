    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$.\n$N = 36036$\n$N = 36 \\times 1001$\n$N = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\n$N = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nAccording to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the group of units modulo $N$ can be decomposed as:\n$(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$\n\nThis implies that any Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters for each prime power factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_m$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $m$.\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for Primitivity and Order\nFor the character $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $N$ and have order 6, two conditions must be met by its components:\n1.  **Primitivity Condition:** $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_m$ is primitive for its respective modulus $m$.\n    *   $cond(\\chi_4) = 4$\n    *   $cond(\\chi_9) = 9$\n    *   $cond(\\chi_7) = 7$\n    *   $cond(\\chi_{11}) = 11$\n    *   $cond(\\chi_{13}) = 13$\n\n2.  **Order Condition:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components.\n    *   $ord(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(ord(\\chi_4), ord(\\chi_9), ord(\\chi_7), ord(\\chi_{11}), ord(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nThe order condition implies:\n(a) The order of each component character, $ord(\\chi_m)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n(b) The lcm must be a multiple of 2 and 3. This means at least one component character must have an order that is a multiple of 2, and at least one must have an order that is a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze and Count Characters for Each Component\nWe will count the number of choices for each component character $\\chi_m$ that satisfies both the primitivity condition and the order condition (a) (i.e., $ord(\\chi_m)$ must divide 6).\n\n*   **For modulus $m=4$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There are $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. The trivial character has conductor 1. The other character is primitive with conductor 4 and has order 2.\n    Since $ord(\\chi_4) = 2$ and $2|6$, this character is a valid choice.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1.\n\n*   **For modulus $m=9$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character is primitive if it is not induced from a character modulo 3. The characters induced from modulo 3 have orders that divide $\\phi(3)=2$. So, primitive characters mod 9 are those with orders 3 or 6.\n    Both orders, 3 and 6, are divisors of 6. So any primitive character mod 9 is a valid choice.\n    The number of primitive characters mod 9 is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$. (These are the $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3 and $\\phi(6)=2$ characters of order 6).\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: 4.\n\n*   **For modulus $m=7$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character is primitive if it's not the trivial character (conductor 1). The possible orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, and 6. All of these orders divide 6.\n    The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(7)-1=5$. (These are the $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2, $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3, and $\\phi(6)=2$ characters of order 6).\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5.\n\n*   **For modulus $m=11$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. Primitive characters are non-trivial, with possible orders 2, 5, and 10. For the order to divide 6, it must be 2.\n    The number of characters of order 2 in $C_{10}$ is $\\phi(2)=1$. This character is non-trivial and thus primitive.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1.\n\n*   **For modulus $m=13$:**\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. Primitive characters are non-trivial, with possible orders 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. For the order to divide 6, it must be 2, 3, or 6.\n    The number of characters with these orders are: $\\phi(2)=1$, $\\phi(3)=2$, $\\phi(6)=2$. All are primitive.\n    Total number of choices: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nWe have found the number of valid choices for each component character such that each is primitive and its order divides 6. Now we must check condition (b) for the lcm.\nFor any combination of the characters we've selected:\n*   The order of $\\chi_4$ is exactly 2. So, the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of 2.\n*   The order of $\\chi_9$ is either 3 or 6. So, the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6.\nFurthermore, since the order of every component character divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\nA number that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be exactly 6.\nTherefore, any combination of the component characters we counted will result in a final character $\\chi$ of order 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal Number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
