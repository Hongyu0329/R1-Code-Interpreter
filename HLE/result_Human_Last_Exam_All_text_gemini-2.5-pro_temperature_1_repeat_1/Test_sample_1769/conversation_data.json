    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the origin of the current Modern English word \"sister\".**\nThe word \"sister\" as we use it today is not a direct evolution from Old English. It is, in fact, a loanword. It was borrowed into English from Old Norse, the language of the Vikings. The Old Norse word was *systir*. This borrowing occurred during the period of Viking raids and settlement in England (roughly 8th to 11th centuries), a time of intense linguistic contact between Old English speakers and Old Norse speakers.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the native Old English word for \"sister\".**\nBefore the Old Norse *systir* became dominant, the Anglo-Saxons had their own native word for a female sibling. This word was **sweoster**. Both the Old Norse *systir* and the Old English *sweoster* come from the same ancient root, the Proto-Germanic word **\\*swestÄ“r**. This is why they look similar, but they followed different developmental paths in their respective languages.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the linguistic replacement.**\nIn areas of England where Norse and English speakers lived side-by-side (the Danelaw), the Norse word *systir* gradually replaced the native English word *sweoster*. The reasons are complex, but the initial \"sk\" or \"s\" sound of the Norse word was perhaps easier to pronounce or simply became dominant through linguistic prevalence. This is a classic example of a loanword replacing a native word for a very common concept.\n\n**Step 4: Hypothesize the evolution of the Old English word without Norse influence.**\nThe core of the question is to imagine what would have happened to the Old English **sweoster** if it had been allowed to evolve naturally into Modern English without being replaced. We can predict this by looking at how other Old English words with similar sounds evolved.\n\n*   The Old English diphthong **eo** (as in *sw**eo**ster*) typically simplified to **e** in Middle English. For example, the Old English *heorte* (heart) became *herte* in Middle English.\n*   Following this pattern, Old English *sweoster* would have become Middle English **swester**.\n*   From Middle English to Modern English, the form *swester* would likely have remained stable, similar to how Middle English *foster* became Modern English \"foster\". The spelling and pronunciation would have standardized around this form.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Cognates vs. Direct Ancestors:** It's crucial to distinguish between a cognate (a word from a different language with a shared origin, like *systir*) and a direct ancestor (the earlier form of the word in the same language, like *sweoster*). The current word \"sister\" descends from the cognate, not the direct ancestor.\n2.  **Sound Laws:** The prediction is based on common, but not universal, sound changes. English linguistic evolution has many irregularities, but the path from *sweoster* to *swester* is a very standard and probable one.\n3.  **Dialectal Variation:** Middle English had many dialects. In some, *sweoster* became *suster*. So, \"suster\" is another, though perhaps less likely, possibility for the modern word. However, \"swester\" represents the more direct and phonetically conservative evolution of the original West Saxon Old English form.\n4.  **The Counterfactual Nature:** This is an exercise in historical linguistics and requires making an educated guess based on known patterns. We are creating an alternate linguistic timeline where a key historical event (the Norse invasion) did not have the same impact.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf the Norse had never invaded and their word *systir* had not entered the English language, the native Old English word *sweoster* would have continued its natural evolution. It would have become *swester* in Middle English and would almost certainly have resulted in the Modern English word being **swester**.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
