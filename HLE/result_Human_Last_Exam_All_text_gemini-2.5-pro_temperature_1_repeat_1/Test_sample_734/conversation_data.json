    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the theologian who first developed the required terminology.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks for a specific **Christian theologian** who meets several criteria:\n1.  They must be the **first** to do this.\n2.  They developed **specialized terminology**. This implies a systematic and unique set of concepts, not just a general discussion.\n3.  This terminology must be able to describe **changes in the laws of nature**.\n4.  The terminology must be applicable to **two specific cases**:\n    a. The **virgin birth of Jesus** (a singular, miraculous event).\n    b. Possible **alterations in natural laws at the Fall** (a systemic, ongoing change in the state of nature).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates\n\nWe need to look at major theologians in Christian history known for integrating philosophy and theology, particularly concerning creation, providence, and miracles.\n\n*   **Early Church Fathers:** Thinkers like Irenaeus, Origen, and Athanasius discussed these topics, but Augustine of Hippo stands out for his systematic philosophical approach.\n*   **Medieval Scholastics:** Thomas Aquinas is a primary candidate due to his comprehensive system of primary and secondary causality.\n*   **Reformation and Modern Theologians:** Figures like John Calvin, C.S. Lewis, and Alvin Plantinga have addressed this, but they are either later than the early candidates or are building upon an established tradition. The question asks for the *first* to develop the terminology.\n\nThis narrows the search primarily to Augustine and Aquinas.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD)\n\nAugustine is a very strong candidate. He developed a sophisticated framework to understand God's relationship with the natural world.\n\n*   **Specialized Terminology:**\n    *   ***Rationes Seminales*** **(Seminal Reasons or Causal Principles):** Augustine proposed that in the initial act of creation, God embedded latent causal principles for everything that would ever come into being.\n    *   ***Cursus Naturae*** **(The Course of Nature):** This refers to the regular, predictable unfolding of the *rationes seminales*. This is what we observe as the \"laws of nature.\"\n    *   **Miracles as not *Contra Naturam* (Against Nature):** Augustine argued that a miracle is not truly against nature as God created it, but rather *supra naturam* (above nature) or ***contra quam est nota natura*** **(against nature as it is known to us)**. A miracle is God acting directly to bring forth a potentiality from the *rationes seminales* that lies outside the usual, observable *cursus naturae*.\n\n*   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth is a perfect example. It's an event contrary to the known, normal course of human reproduction. In Augustine's terms, God bypassed the *cursus naturae* to activate a potentiality He had placed within creation from the beginning, allowing for a birth without a human father. It is against nature *as we know it*, but not against the deeper nature God instituted.\n\n*   **Application to the Fall:** The Fall introduced sin and corruption. Augustine described this as a wound or vitiation of nature. This can be understood as a systemic alteration of the *cursus naturae*. The original, intended course of nature was one of integrity and incorruption. After the Fall, the *rationes seminales* unfold in a frustrated or corrupted manner, leading to death, decay, and futility (\"thorns and thistles\"). The fundamental principles of nature are not destroyed, but their operation and outcomes are changed.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Augustine:** Augustine's system provides a single, coherent set of specialized terms (*rationes seminales*, *cursus naturae*) that can explain both a one-time miracle and a systemic change in how nature operates. As a 4th-5th century figure, he is chronologically the earliest major theologian to develop such a detailed system.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274 AD)\n\nAquinas, writing 800 years after Augustine, also had a sophisticated system.\n\n*   **Specialized Terminology:**\n    *   **Primary Cause (God) and Secondary Causes (Created things):** God is the First Cause of everything. He endows created things (secondary causes) with their own powers to act according to their natures.\n    *   **Natural Law:** This is the predictable operation of secondary causes.\n    *   **Miracles:** A miracle is an event where God, as the Primary Cause, acts directly upon the world, bypassing the normal chain of secondary causes.\n\n*   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** This fits perfectly. God, the Primary Cause, produced the effect of conception directly, without the secondary cause of a human father.\n\n*   **Application to the Fall:** Here, Aquinas's model differs subtly. He argued that immortality and integrity were **preternatural gifts** added on top of Adam's nature. The Fall was the *loss* of these gifts. Consequently, nature was simply left to its own devices, and its inherent potential for decay and death (which was always there) was actualized. In this view, the laws of nature *did not change*; rather, a supernatural grace that held their negative effects in check was removed.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Aquinas:** While Aquinas's system is powerful, it does not perfectly match the question's phrasing of \"changes in the laws of nature\" regarding the Fall. He tends to preserve the integrity of natural law itself. More importantly, he is not the *first* major theologian to systematically address this; Augustine predates him significantly.\n\n### Step 5: Final Determination\n\nComparing the candidates, **Augustine of Hippo** is the correct answer. He was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specific, technical vocabulary (*rationes seminales*, *cursus naturae*, the distinction between nature and nature-as-we-know-it) that provides a unified explanation for how the natural order can be altered, accommodating both singular miracles like the virgin birth and a systemic shift in its operation due to the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
