    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the objects and the question**\nWe are given a Riemann surface C of genus $g=3$ and its 15th symmetric power, $X = C^{(15)}$. The symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ is the space of effective divisors of degree $d$ on C. It is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension $d$. Here, $d=15$. We need to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, denoted as $\\rho(X)$, as C varies over all genus 3 Riemann surfaces. The rank of the Neron-Severi group is also known as the Picard number.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to the Jacobian of C**\nThe Neron-Severi group $NS(X)$ is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank $\\rho(X)$ is the dimension of the rational vector space $NS(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. By the Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem, this rank is equal to the dimension of the space of Hodge classes of type (1,1) in the second cohomology group, i.e., $\\rho(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cap H^{1,1}(X))$.\n\nFor the symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ of a curve C of genus $g$, there is a fundamental relationship between its cohomology and the cohomology of the Jacobian variety $J(C)$. For $d \\ge g$, the second cohomology group of $C^{(d)}$ has a simple decomposition:\n$H^2(C^{(d)}, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus \\mathbb{Q} \\cdot L$\nHere, $L$ is the class of a divisor on $C^{(d)}$ obtained by fixing a point on C, i.e., the image of the natural inclusion $C^{(d-1)} \\hookrightarrow C^{(d)}$.\nIn our case, $d=15$ and $g=3$, so the condition $d \\ge g$ is satisfied.\n\nThis isomorphism respects the Hodge structures. The class $L$ is an algebraic cycle class, so it is of type (1,1). The map from $J(C)$ is induced by the Abel-Jacobi map, which is holomorphic. Therefore, the dimension of the space of Hodge classes also splits:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve C.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the possible range for the rank of NS(J(C))**\n$J(C)$ is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$. The rank of its Neron-Severi group, $\\rho(J(C))$, is bounded above by the dimension of the space $H^{1,1}(J(C))$. We have:\n$h^{1,1}(J(C)) = \\dim H^{1,1}(J(C)) = (\\dim H^{1,0}(J(C))) \\cdot (\\dim H^{0,1}(J(C))) = g \\cdot g = 3^2 = 9$.\nSo, we must have $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 9$. The lower bound of 1 comes from the fact that the polarization class is always an element of $NS(J(C))$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the smallest possible rank**\nThe smallest possible rank occurs for a \"general\" curve C. For a general genus 3 curve, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety whose ring of endomorphisms is just the integers, $\\text{End}(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Neron-Severi group is generated solely by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\nTherefore, for a general genus 3 curve C, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\nThis gives the smallest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$:\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the largest possible rank**\nThe largest possible rank is achieved for a \"special\" curve C, one whose Jacobian has extra structure, such as being non-simple or having complex multiplication (CM). To maximize $\\rho(J(C))$, we need to maximize the number of independent algebraic 2-cycles on it. This typically happens when $J(C)$ is isogenous to a product of abelian varieties of smaller dimension, which themselves have large Neron-Severi ranks.\n\nConsider the case where $J(C)$ is isogenous to a product of three elliptic curves, $J(C) \\sim E_1 \\times E_2 \\times E_3$. To maximize the rank, we should choose these elliptic curves to have complex multiplication and to be isogenous to each other. Let $E_1=E_2=E_3=E$, where E is an elliptic curve with CM. An example of such a genus 3 curve is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = 1$. Its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to $E^3$, where $E$ is the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$, which has CM by the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nFor an abelian variety $A = E^3$ with the product polarization, where E has CM by an order $O_K$ in an imaginary quadratic field $K$, its Neron-Severi group $NS(A)$ is isomorphic to the group of $3 \\times 3$ Hermitian matrices over $O_K$. A matrix $M$ is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose, $M = \\bar{M}^T$. The rank of this group is the dimension of the space of such matrices over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A $g \\times g$ Hermitian matrix over $K$ is determined by $g$ real diagonal entries and $g(g-1)/2$ off-diagonal entries from $K$. The dimension over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $g \\cdot 1 + \\frac{g(g-1)}{2} \\cdot 2 = g^2$.\nFor $g=3$, the rank is $3^2 = 9$.\n\nSo, for the Fermat quartic curve, $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$. This achieves the theoretical maximum value calculated in Step 3.\nThis gives the largest possible rank for $\\rho(X)$:\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n- The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is 2, occurring when C is a general genus 3 curve.\n- The largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is 10, occurring when C is a special curve like the Fermat quartic, whose Jacobian is isogenous to a product of three CM elliptic curves.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
