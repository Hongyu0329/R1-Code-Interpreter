    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Name\n\nFirst, we need to understand the components of the name \"perfluoronanocar\".\n*   **perfluoro-**: This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry. It signifies that all hydrogen (H) atoms in the parent hydrocarbon molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n*   **nanocar**: This is not a standard IUPAC name but a common name for a specific class of molecular machines designed in the field of nanotechnology. To answer the question, we must identify the specific structure of the most common \"nanocar\".\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Structure of the Parent \"Nanocar\"\n\nThe most famous \"nanocar\" is the one developed by the research group of Professor James Tour at Rice University. This molecule consists of two main components:\n1.  A central **chassis**.\n2.  Four **wheels** attached to the chassis via axles.\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to determine the molecular formula of this parent nanocar, specifically the number of hydrogen atoms it contains.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Components and Count the Hydrogen Atoms\n\nWe need to count the hydrogen atoms on each part of the nanocar molecule.\n\n*   **The Wheels:** The wheels of the most common nanocar are molecules of buckminsterfullerene, also known as \"buckyballs\". The chemical formula for buckminsterfullerene is C60. It is an allotrope of carbon, and its structure is a sphere made of 60 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A C60 molecule contains only carbon atoms and has **zero hydrogen atoms**. Therefore, the four wheels do not contribute any hydrogens to the total count.\n\n*   **The Chassis:** The problem now reduces to counting the hydrogen atoms on the chassis to which the wheels are attached. The chassis of the original nanocar has a specific structure based on an oligo(phenylene ethynylene) framework. Let's break it down:\n    1.  **Central Ring:** The core of the chassis is a benzene ring that is substituted at four positions (specifically, positions 1, 2, 4, and 5). A benzene ring (C6H6) has 6 carbon atoms and 6 hydrogen atoms. When it is substituted at four positions, four of its hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups. This leaves hydrogen atoms only at the two unsubstituted positions (3 and 6).\n        *   Number of hydrogens on the central ring = **2**.\n    2.  **\"Body\" Groups:** At positions 1 and 4 of the central ring, there are phenylethynyl groups (`-C≡C-C6H5`). The important part for our count is the terminal phenyl group (`-C6H5`). A phenyl group has 5 hydrogen atoms. Since there are two of these groups, they contribute a total of 2 * 5 = 10 hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Number of hydrogens on the body groups = **10**.\n    3.  **Axles:** At positions 2 and 5 of the central ring, there are ethynyl groups (`-C≡C-`) that act as axles. These axles form a bond directly with the carbon atoms of the C60 wheels.\n        *   **Careful Point:** These axle groups consist only of carbon atoms (`-C≡C-`) and serve as the linker. They do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them in the final nanocar structure.\n        *   Number of hydrogens on the axles = **0**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogens\n\nBy summing the hydrogen atoms from all parts of the nanocar molecule, we get the total count:\n*   Total Hydrogens = (H from wheels) + (H from central ring) + (H from body groups) + (H from axles)\n*   Total Hydrogens = 0 + 2 + 10 + 0 = **12**\n\nSo, the parent nanocar molecule contains 12 hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Number of Fluorine Atoms\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" means we must replace every hydrogen atom in the molecule with a fluorine atom.\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms to be replaced = 12\n*   Number of fluorine atoms that will be added = 12\n\nTherefore, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 12 fluorine atoms.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the structure of the most common nanocar and the definition of the \"perfluoro-\" prefix, the final answer is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
