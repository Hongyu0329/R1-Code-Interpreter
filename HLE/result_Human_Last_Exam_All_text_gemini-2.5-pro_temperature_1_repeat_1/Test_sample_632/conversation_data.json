    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Associated Landmark:** The Pantheon church.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** It was removed.\n*   **Timeframe:** The question specifies the removal happened in 1950.\n\n**Step 2: Identify potential candidates for the \"architectural feature\"**\nThe most famous architectural elements ever added to and later removed from the Pantheon are the twin bell towers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the candidate feature - The Bell Towers**\n*   **Origin:** In the 17th century (c. 1626), under Pope Urban VIII, the renowned architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini was commissioned to add two bell towers to the Pantheon's facade.\n*   **Uniqueness and Reception:** These towers were highly controversial from the beginning. Many critics and the Roman populace felt they were an ugly Baroque addition that ruined the classical harmony of the ancient temple. They were given the derogatory nickname **\"le orecchie d'asino\"** or **\"the donkey's ears.\"** This certainly qualifies them as a \"unique\" and notable feature.\n*   **Removal:** Due to their enduring unpopularity and a desire to restore the Pantheon to its perceived original state, the towers were eventually demolished.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the date of removal**\nThis is the most critical point. The question states the removal occurred in 1950. However, historical records confirm that **\"the donkey's ears\" were removed in 1883**, not 1950. This was done under the authority of the then Minister of Public Education, Guido Baccelli, as part of a larger project to restore ancient monuments after the unification of Italy. There is no major architectural feature that was removed from the Piazza or the Pantheon in 1950.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe question contains a factual error regarding the date. The \"unique architectural feature\" it refers to is almost certainly the pair of bell towers known as \"the donkey's ears.\" They are the most famous and significant architectural element ever removed from the Pantheon. The date of removal was 1883.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe feature was a pair of twin bell towers, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the 17th century. They were widely disliked by the public and derisively nicknamed \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the donkey's ears). While the question states they were removed in 1950, they were actually demolished in 1883 to restore the Pantheon's classical appearance.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers known as \"the donkey's ears\".>>>"
