    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question provides two key pieces of information to identify a specific novel:\n1.  A quote attributed to Jorge Luis Borges: The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the novel's author, also by Borges: He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nThe goal is to find the novel that fits both these descriptions.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Source of the Information**\nThe first careful point is to recognize that these specific comments are likely from a single piece of writing by Borges, probably a review, essay, or prologue. The search must focus on Borges's non-fiction literary criticism.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Faulkner\" Clue**\nThe description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" points to a 20th-century Latin American writer who was influenced by Faulkner's modernist techniques (such as complex narrative structures, stream-of-consciousness, and the creation of a mythical, self-contained fictional county like Yoknapatawpha). The term \"simplifier\" suggests that this author adapted these complex techniques into a more focused or personal style. A prominent writer known for this connection is the Uruguayan author Juan Carlos Onetti, who created the fictional city of Santa María.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the \"Tiger and Chess\" Clue**\nThis is a very specific and poetic quote. \"Intensity of a tiger\" suggests a raw, fierce, and powerful narrative drive. \"Variety that a chess duel can achieve\" suggests a work that is highly structured, intellectually complex, and full of strategic, deliberate moves and counter-moves within its plot and character interactions. We need to find where Borges used this exact phrasing.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Clues and Locate the Text**\nCombining the search for \"Borges,\" \"Onetti,\" \"Faulkner,\" and the specific quote leads to a definitive source: **the prologue Jorge Luis Borges wrote for the 1961 edition of Juan Carlos Onetti's novel *El astillero*** (*The Shipyard*).\n\n*   In this prologue, Borges explicitly makes the connection to Faulkner, discussing Onetti's creation of the mythical world of Santa María and his inheritance of Faulkner's narrative methods.\n*   In the same text, Borges offers his praise for the novel, using the exact phrase in question. He writes (in the original Spanish): \"*Posee la intensidad de un tigre y la variedad que puede lograr un duelo de ajedrez.*\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth clues provided in the question point directly to the same novel. The author described as a continuator of Faulkner is Juan Carlos Onetti, and the novel praised with the \"tiger and chess\" metaphor is his 1961 work, *El astillero*.\n\n<<<*El astillero* (*The Shipyard*)>>>"
