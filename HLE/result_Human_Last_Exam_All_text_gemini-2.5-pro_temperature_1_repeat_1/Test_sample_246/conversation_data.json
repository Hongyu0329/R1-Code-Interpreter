    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the manifold and its fundamental group\n\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot ($3_1$) and $m=5$. We are interested in the fundamental group of the 4-manifold $M = \\Sigma_2(S^4, \\tau_m K)$, which is the double branched cover of the 4-sphere $S^4$ over the $m$-twist-spun knot of $K$, denoted $\\tau_m K$.\n\nA crucial result by Teruhisa Kanenobu (\"Fundamental group of the double branched cover of a sphere over a twist-spun knot\", 1986) establishes a direct connection between this 4-manifold's fundamental group and the fundamental group of a related 3-manifold.\n\n**Theorem (Kanenobu):** The fundamental group of the 2-fold branched covering space of $S^4$ over the $m$-twist-spun knot $\\tau_m K$ is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the 3-manifold obtained by $m$-framed Dehn surgery on the knot $K$.\n\nLet $M(K; m)$ denote the 3-manifold obtained by $m$-surgery on the knot $K$. The theorem states:\n$\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(S^4, \\tau_m K)) \\cong \\pi_1(M(K; m))$.\n\nIn our specific case, $K$ is the trefoil knot and $m=5$. Therefore, we need to find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the 3-manifold $M(3_1; 5)$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the abelianization of the fundamental group\n\nThe minimal number of generators of a group $G$, denoted $d(G)$, is bounded below by the minimal number of generators of its abelianization, $G^{ab} = G/[G,G]$. The abelianization of the fundamental group of a space is its first homology group with integer coefficients, $H_1(\\cdot; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nFor a 3-manifold $M(K; m)$ obtained by integer $m$-surgery on a knot $K \\subset S^3$, the first homology group is well-known:\n$H_1(M(K; m); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{|m|}$.\n\nIn our case, $m=5$. So, the abelianization of our group is:\n$(\\pi_1(M(3_1; 5)))^{ab} = H_1(M(3_1; 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$.\n\n### Step 3: Find a lower bound for the number of generators\n\nThe minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ is 1. Since $d(G) \\ge d(G^{ab})$, we have:\n$d(\\pi_1(M(3_1; 5))) \\ge d(\\mathbb{Z}_5) = 1$.\n\nThis tells us that the group is non-trivial and requires at least one generator.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if the fundamental group is cyclic\n\nIf the group $\\pi_1(M(3_1; 5))$ is cyclic, then its minimal number of generators is 1 (since it's not the trivial group). A 3-manifold has a cyclic fundamental group if and only if it is a lens space (or $S^3$ or $S^2 \\times S^1$, which are special cases). We need to determine whether $M(3_1; 5)$ is a lens space.\n\nTo do this, we use a result from the theory of Dehn surgery on torus knots. The trefoil knot is the simplest torus knot, denoted $T(2,3)$.\n\n**Theorem (Moser):** An integer Dehn surgery with coefficient $r$ on a torus knot $T(p,q)$ (where $|p|,|q|>1$) results in a manifold with a cyclic fundamental group (i.e., a lens space) if and only if the surgery coefficient $r$ satisfies the condition $|r - pq| = 1$.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the theorem to our specific case\n\nFor the trefoil knot $T(2,3)$, we have $p=2$ and $q=3$. The surgery coefficient is $r=5$. We check the condition from the theorem:\n$|r - pq| = |5 - (2)(3)| = |5 - 6| = |-1| = 1$.\n\nThe condition is satisfied. Therefore, the manifold $M(3_1; 5)$ is a lens space, and its fundamental group is cyclic.\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the minimal number of generators\n\nWe have established two facts:\n1.  The fundamental group $\\pi_1(M(3_1; 5))$ is cyclic.\n2.  The abelianization of this group is $\\mathbb{Z}_5$.\n\nA cyclic group is completely determined by its abelianization. Thus, $\\pi_1(M(3_1; 5)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$.\nThe minimal number of generators for the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ is 1.\n\nFinal Answer: The minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
