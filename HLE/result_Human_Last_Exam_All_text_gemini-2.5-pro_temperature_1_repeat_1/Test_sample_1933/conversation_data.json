    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where $S$ contains 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Language and the Concepts\n\nThe schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A model or structure for this schema is a universe of elements $U$ along with interpretations for these predicates, which are subsets of $U$.\n\nThe logical language is a fragment of First-Order Logic, denoted $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. This means the formulas are constructed using:\n*   Atomic formulas: $P_i(x)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and a variable $x$.\n*   Logical connectives: Conjunction ($\\land$).\n*   Quantifiers: Existential quantifier ($\\exists$).\n*   Logical constants: True ($\\top$) and False ($\\bot$).\n\nWe are interested in the VC dimension of the concept class defined by formulas in this language with one free variable, say $x$. A concept is a set of elements $\\{u \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(u)\\}$ for some model $\\mathcal{M}$ and some formula $\\phi(x)$ from the language. The VC dimension of the language is the maximum size $d$ of a set of points that can be shattered, maximized over all possible models.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Formulas\n\nLet $\\phi(x)$ be any formula in the language with one free variable $x$. By converting it to prenex normal form, and since only $\\exists$ is allowed, $\\phi(x)$ can be written as:\n$\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 ... \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, ..., y_m)$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula.\n\nSince the language only allows $\\land, \\top, \\bot$ as connectives and atomic formulas are positive (no negation), $\\psi$ must be a conjunction of atomic formulas.\nThe variables in these atomic formulas are from the set $\\{x, y_1, ..., y_m\\}$. We can group the conjuncts by the variable they contain:\n$\\psi = C_x(x) \\land C_1(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land C_m(y_m)$\nwhere $C_x(x)$ is a conjunction of atoms involving only $x$, and each $C_j(y_j)$ is a conjunction of atoms involving only $y_j$. For example, $C_x(x)$ could be $P_1(x) \\land P_4(x)$.\n\nSo the formula $\\phi(x)$ becomes:\n$\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 ... \\exists y_m (C_x(x) \\land C_1(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land C_m(y_m))$\n\nSince $C_x(x)$ does not depend on the quantified variables $y_j$, we can pull it out of the scope of the quantifiers:\n$\\phi(x) = C_x(x) \\land (\\exists y_1 C_1(y_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists y_m C_m(y_m))$\n\nEach part $\\exists y_j C_j(y_j)$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). Let's denote the conjunction of all these sentences as $S = (\\exists y_1 C_1(y_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists y_m C_m(y_m))$.\nSo, any formula $\\phi(x)$ in the language is equivalent to one of the form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv C(x) \\land S$\nwhere $C(x)$ is a conjunction of a subset of the atomic predicates $\\{P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)\\}$, and $S$ is a sentence.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Set of Definable Concepts\n\nFor any given model $\\mathcal{M}$, the sentence $S$ is either true or false.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\models S$ (S is true in the model), then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $C(x)$. The concept defined is $\\{u \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models C(u)\\}$.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models S$ (S is false in the model), then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $C(x) \\land \\bot$, which is $\\bot$. The concept defined is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n\nThe formula $C(x)$ is a conjunction of some subset of $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. These are also known as positive monomials. There are $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets of these four predicates, leading to 16 distinct such conjunctions (including the empty conjunction, which is equivalent to $\\top$).\n\nThis means that in any model, any formula from our language can only define concepts that are either the empty set or one of the 16 concepts defined by the positive monomials. Let $\\mathcal{H}_{mono}$ be the concept class consisting of these 16 concepts. The set of all concepts definable in any model is a subset of $\\mathcal{H}_{mono} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Establish an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a concept class is the maximum size of a set that it can shatter. To shatter a set of size $d$, a concept class must be able to generate all $2^d$ subsets of it. This requires the class to have at least $2^d$ distinct concepts.\n\nThe class of concepts definable by our language in any model has at most $16 + 1 = 17$ members (16 from monomials, plus the empty set). If we try to shatter a set of 5 points, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ subsets. Since we have at most 17 concepts, we cannot shatter 5 points.\nTherefore, the VC dimension must be less than 5.\nVCdim($\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$) $\\le 4$.\n\nMore formally, the VC dimension of the language is upper-bounded by the VC dimension of the class $\\mathcal{H}_{mono}$. The VC dimension of the class of positive monomials over $k$ variables is known to be $k$. In our case, $k=4$. Thus, the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Step 5: Establish a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists a model $\\mathcal{M}$ and a set of 4 points $X \\subseteq U$ that can be shattered by the language.\n\nLet's construct such a model. Let the universe contain a set of 4 points, $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We define the interpretation of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ on these points as follows:\n$P_j(x_i)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n\nFor example:\n*   For $x_1$: $P_1(x_1)$ is false, but $P_2(x_1), P_3(x_1), P_4(x_1)$ are true.\n*   For $x_2$: $P_2(x_2)$ is false, but $P_1(x_2), P_3(x_2), P_4(x_2)$ are true.\n*   ...and so on.\n\nNow, we need to show that for any subset $X' \\subseteq X$, there exists a formula $\\phi(x)$ in our language such that the concept it defines is exactly $X'$.\nLet $J = \\{i \\mid x_i \\in X'\\}$ be the set of indices of points in the target subset $X'$.\nConsider the formula $\\phi_{X'}(x)$ defined as the conjunction of predicates whose indices are *not* in $J$:\n$\\phi_{X'}(x) = \\bigwedge_{k \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus J} P_k(x)$\nThis is a quantifier-free formula, so it belongs to our language.\n\nLet's check which points satisfy this formula:\nAn element $x_i$ satisfies $\\phi_{X'}(x)$ if and only if for all $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus J$, $P_k(x_i)$ is true.\nBy our construction, $P_k(x_i)$ is true if and only if $k \\neq i$.\nSo, $x_i$ satisfies $\\phi_{X'}(x)$ if and only if for all $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus J$, we have $k \\neq i$.\nThis condition is equivalent to stating that $i$ is not in the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus J$.\nWhich means $i \\in J$.\nWhich means $x_i \\in X'$.\n\nSo, the formula $\\phi_{X'}(x)$ is satisfied by exactly the points in $X'$. This shows that we can generate any subset of $X$. Thus, the set $X$ is shattered.\nSince we have shattered a set of size 4, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 4, we have the upper bound: VCdim $\\le 4$.\nFrom Step 5, we have the lower bound: VCdim $\\ge 4$.\nCombining these two results, we can conclude that the VC dimension is exactly 4."
