    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Setting up the Coordinate System**\n\nTo make the problem easier to analyze, we can place the first cube in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's call it Cube A. We will align its edges with the coordinate axes and place one of its vertices at the origin (0, 0, 0).\n\n*   **Cube A:** This cube has a side length of 1. It occupies the region defined by the inequalities:\n    *   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the Shift**\n\nThe second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A. The shift is described as \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". This phrase can be interpreted in a few ways, so we must choose the most logical one.\n\n*   **The Main Diagonal:** In our coordinate system for Cube A, the main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **D** = (1, 1, 1). The length of this diagonal is |**D**| = √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3.\n\n*   **Interpreting \"shifted by 1/2\":**\n    1.  **Interpretation A (Shift by a distance of 1/2):** The shift could be a displacement vector of length 1/2 in the direction of the main diagonal. This would be a vector **v** = (1/2) * (**D** / |**D**|) = (1/2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\n    2.  **Interpretation B (Shift by half the diagonal vector):** The phrase could mean the displacement vector is half of the main diagonal vector itself. This is a very common way to describe a proportional shift. The vector would be **v** = (1/2) * **D** = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n*   **Choosing the Correct Interpretation:** Interpretation B creates a much more elegant geometric arrangement. The center of Cube A, which is at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), becomes the corner of Cube B. The corner of Cube A at (1, 1, 1) becomes the center of Cube B. This symmetry suggests it's the intended meaning. Furthermore, the magnitude of the shift in Interpretation B is |**v**| = √((1/2)² + (1/2)² + (1/2)²) = √(3/4) = √3 / 2. This distance is exactly half the length of the main diagonal (√3). So, \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" most naturally means a shift of half the diagonal's length and vector. We will proceed with Interpretation B.\n\n**Step 3: Defining the Second Cube**\n\nUsing the displacement vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), we can find the position of Cube B. It is simply Cube A translated by **v**.\n\n*   **Cube B:** We add 1/2 to the bounds of each coordinate for Cube A.\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Volume of the Intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for both Cube A and Cube B. Let's find the bounds for this region.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** A point in the intersection must have an x-value that is in both [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2]. The overlap is [1/2, 1].\n    *   max(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** Similarly, the y-value must be in both [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2]. The overlap is [1/2, 1].\n    *   max(0, 1/2) ≤ y ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The z-value must also be in both [0, 1] and [1/2, 3/2]. The overlap is [1/2, 1].\n    *   max(0, 1/2) ≤ z ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThe intersection is a rectangular prism (specifically, a cube) defined by these new bounds.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Final Volume**\n\nThe side lengths of the intersection cube are the differences between the upper and lower bounds for each coordinate.\n*   Side length in x = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Side length in y = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Side length in z = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Coordinate System Choice:** Aligning the first cube with the coordinate axes (e.g., vertices at (0,0,0) and (1,1,1)) greatly simplifies the calculations. The volume is independent of the cube's orientation in space.\n2.  **Interpreting the \"Shift\":** This is the most critical step. The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is ambiguous. The interpretation as a shift by the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) (i.e., half the diagonal vector) is the most plausible one due to the geometric elegance of the resulting arrangement and the common use of such proportional language. The alternative (a shift distance of 1/2) leads to a much more complex and less \"clean\" answer.\n3.  **Finding Intersection Bounds:** When finding the intersection of two ranges [a, b] and [c, d], the resulting range is [max(a, c), min(b, d)]. This must be applied systematically for each coordinate.\n4.  **Final Volume Calculation:** The resulting intersection is a cube, so its volume is simply (side length)³.\n\nThe analysis consistently leads to the conclusion that the intersection is a smaller cube with a side length of 1/2.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
