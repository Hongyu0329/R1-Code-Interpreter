    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene, CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂). This is a classic conjugated diene, containing a system of 4 π-electrons.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂). This is an alkene, which can act as a dienophile. The presence of electron-withdrawing halogen atoms makes it a good dienophile.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition, where the 4 π-electrons from the diene and the 2 π-electrons from the dienophile react in a concerted fashion to form a six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Visualize the Mechanism:**\n    *   For the reaction to occur, butadiene must adopt the *s-cis* conformation.\n    *   The diene and dienophile align, and a cyclic shift of electrons occurs:\n        *   The π-bond between C1 and C2 of butadiene forms a new sigma bond with one of the carbons of the dienophile (e.g., the CCl₂ carbon).\n        *   The π-bond of the dienophile (C=C) breaks to form a new sigma bond with C4 of butadiene.\n        *   The π-bond between C3 and C4 of butadiene moves to form a new π-bond between C2 and C3.\n    *   This concerted mechanism results in the formation of two new sigma bonds and one new pi bond, all within a newly formed six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    *   The backbone of the product is a six-membered ring containing one double bond, which is a **cyclohexene** ring.\n    *   The double bond in the product is located between the carbons that were C2 and C3 of the original butadiene.\n    *   The substituents from the dienophile (two Cl atoms and two F atoms) are now attached to the two adjacent sp³-hybridized carbons that originated from the dienophile's double bond.\n    *   So, the product has a cyclohexene ring structure with a -CCl₂- group and a -CF₂- group on adjacent carbons.\n\n4.  **Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature (Careful Point):**\n    *   **Parent Ring:** The parent structure is cyclohexene.\n    *   **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbons of the double bond are numbered C1 and C2. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (positions). In this case, the substituted carbons will be at positions 4 and 5, regardless of the direction of numbering (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n    *   **Alphabetical Priority:** When two different numbering schemes give the same set of locants (here, 4,4,5,5), the tie is broken by giving the lower number to the substituent group that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   **Substituents:** The substituents are \"chloro\" and \"fluoro\".\n    *   **Applying the Rule:** Since \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically, the carbon atom with the two chlorine atoms is assigned the lower number (position 4). The carbon with the two fluorine atoms is assigned position 5.\n    *   **Final Name:** Combining all the parts, the product is named **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n\n*   **Recognition:** Correctly identifying the reaction as a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition is the key.\n*   **Connectivity:** Understand that a six-membered ring is formed and that the substituents from the dienophile will be on adjacent carbons in the product ring.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The diene is symmetrical, so only one structural product is formed. The relative positions of the -CCl₂- and -CF₂- groups are fixed next to each other.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** Strict application of IUPAC rules, particularly the rule for alphabetical priority when locants are tied, is necessary to arrive at the correct name.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, which forms a six-membered ring. The resulting product is named by applying IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\nThe product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
