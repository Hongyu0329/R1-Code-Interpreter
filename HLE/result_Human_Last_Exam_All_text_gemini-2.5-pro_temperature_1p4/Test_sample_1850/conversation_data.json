    "This is a question that requires careful textual analysis of John Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*. To answer it accurately, we must establish clear criteria and then meticulously search the text.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Defining the Terms**\n\n*   **\"Historical Saint\":** This term can be interpreted broadly. In the context of Milton, a 17th-century Protestant, this would primarily include major revered figures from the Old and New Testaments (patriarchs, prophets) whom he saw as part of the lineage of the faithful. It would also include post-biblical figures from Christian history, though Milton's view of them, particularly those revered by the Catholic Church, is often critical or satirical.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\":** This means the individual's actual name must appear in the text of the poem. A description or an allusion, no matter how clear, is not sufficient. For example, referring to Moses as \"that Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed\" does not count, but using the name \"Moses\" does.\n\n**Step 2: Scrutinizing the Text of *Paradise Lost***\n\nWe will now go through the poem to identify every figure who meets these criteria. The mentions are concentrated in the historical visions and narrations in the later books.\n\n1.  **David:** The king of Israel is mentioned by name in Book I. When listing the pagan gods who corrupted Israel, Milton notes that the worship of Moloch continued \"till prudent **David** felt / His pride, and piety his heart contrite...\"\n2.  **Abraham:** The patriarch is named multiple times. God the Father refers to him in Book III, and the Archangel Michael names him in Book XII when recounting the history of Israel to Adam.\n3.  **Moses:** The lawgiver of Israel is alluded to early on but is explicitly named by Michael in Book XII when describing the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai \"...to the hand of **Moses**.\"\n4.  **Joshua:** The successor to Moses is named in Book XII. Michael tells Adam that the Israelites will be led into Canaan \"...by **Joshua**, whom the Gentiles Jesus call.\"\n5.  **Enoch:** In Book XI, after Adam witnesses a vision of a righteous man being taken to Heaven, Michael confirms his identity, saying, \"This was that **Enoch**...\"\n6.  **Dominic:** In Book III, Milton satirizes the Catholic concept of the \"Limbo of Vanity,\" a place for foolish and vainglorious people. He includes those who, \"to be sure of Paradise, / Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**...\" This is a clear, though satirical, mention of the historical Saint Dominic.\n7.  **Francis:** In the very same passage as Dominic, Milton refers to those who \"in **Franciscan** think to pass disguised.\" This is an adjectival form, but it is an unmistakable reference to the historical Saint Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan order. It is a mention *by his name*, using it to identify his followers and his tradition.\n\n### **Careful Points and Exclusions**\n\n*   **Figures Mentioned Only in the \"Arguments\":** Milton wrote short prose summaries, called \"The Argument,\" for each book. These summaries name both **Noah** and **Job**. However, their names do not appear within the poetic verse itself. Standard interpretation considers \"in the poem\" to mean the verse, so these two are excluded from the count.\n*   **Figures Alluded to but Not Named:** Many hugely important figures are clearly described but not named. This includes **Mary** (referred to as \"the Virgin\"), **John the Baptist** (the \"great Proclaimer\"), **Solomon** (David's \"Son, and his next heir\"), **Abel**, and all of the **Apostles** like Peter and Paul.\n*   **Adam and Eve:** As the primary characters of the epic, they are not typically considered \"saints mentioned\" in the referential way the question implies.\n*   **Adjectival Naming (\"Franciscan\"):** This is the most subtle point. While the literal word \"Francis\" doesn't appear, \"Franciscan\" is a direct eponym derived from his name, used specifically to identify him as the founder of the order. It functions as a naming act and is therefore included.\n\n### **Final Tally**\n\nBased on a meticulous search of the poetic verse and applying the criteria established above, we arrive at the following list:\n\n1.  David\n2.  Abraham\n3.  Moses\n4.  Joshua\n5.  Enoch\n6.  Dominic\n7.  Francis (via \"Franciscan\")\n\nThis gives a total of 7 historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<7>>>"
