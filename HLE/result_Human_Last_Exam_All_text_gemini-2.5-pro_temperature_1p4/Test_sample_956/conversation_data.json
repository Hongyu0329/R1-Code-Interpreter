    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the group G**\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations $a, b, c$ acting on the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z\\}$ of size 12. $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{12}$.\n\n*   **Generators:**\n    $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n    $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n    $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\n*   **Parity of generators:** We determine if the generators are even or odd permutations. A $k$-cycle is an even permutation if $k$ is odd, and an odd permutation if $k$ is even.\n    *   $a$ is an 11-cycle. Since 11 is odd, $a$ is an even permutation.\n    *   $b$ is a product of two 4-cycles. Each 4-cycle is odd. The product of two odd permutations is an even permutation. So, $b$ is even.\n    *   $c$ is a product of six 2-cycles (transpositions). Each transposition is odd. The product of an even number of odd permutations is even. So, $c$ is even.\n    Since all generators $a, b, c$ are even permutations, any element of $G$ is a product of even permutations, and thus is also an even permutation. Therefore, $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n    $G \\le A_{12}$.\n\n*   **Transitivity of G:** A group is transitive on a set if for any two elements $s_1, s_2$ in the set, there exists a group element $g$ such that $g(s_1) = s_2$. This is equivalent to showing that the orbit of any element is the entire set.\n    Let's find the orbit of the element 1.\n    The generator $a$ is an 11-cycle that includes 1. The orbit of 1 under $\\langle a \\rangle$ is $\\{1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x\\}$.\n    Now consider the action of other generators. The element $c$ maps 3 to $z$. Since 3 is in the orbit of 1, $z$ must also be in the orbit of 1 under the full group $G$.\n    The orbit of 1 therefore contains $\\{1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x\\} \\cup \\{z\\}$, which is the entire set $S$.\n    So, $G$ is a transitive group on the 12 elements of $S$.\n\n*   **2-Transitivity of G:** A group $G$ acting on a set $S$ is 2-transitive if it is transitive and for any element $s \\in S$, the stabilizer subgroup $G_s = \\{g \\in G \\mid g(s)=s\\}$ is transitive on the remaining set $S \\setminus \\{s\\}$.\n    Let's consider the stabilizer of the element $z$, denoted $G_z$.\n    The generators $a$ and $b$ both fix the element $z$ (i.e., $a(z)=z$ and $b(z)=z$).\n    Therefore, the subgroup generated by $a$ and $b$, $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle$, is a subgroup of $G_z$.\n    $H$ acts on the set $S' = S \\setminus \\{z\\}$, which has 11 elements.\n    The generator $a$ acts on $S'$ as the 11-cycle $(1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$.\n    A group acting on a set of $n$ elements is transitive if it contains an $n$-cycle.\n    Since $H$ contains the 11-cycle $a$, $H$ is transitive on the 11 elements of $S'$.\n    Since $G_z$ contains the transitive subgroup $H$, $G_z$ must also be transitive on $S'$.\n    Because $G$ is transitive on $S$ and $G_z$ is transitive on $S \\setminus \\{z\\}$, $G$ is a 2-transitive group of degree 12.\n\n*   **Identification of G:** We can now use a classical result from group theory by Camille Jordan: any 2-transitive permutation group of degree $n$ that contains a cycle of length $n-1$ must be either the alternating group $A_n$ or the symmetric group $S_n$.\n    In our case, $n=12$. $G$ is a 2-transitive group of degree 12. The generator $a$ is a cycle of length 11, which is $n-1$.\n    Thus, $G$ must be either $A_{12}$ or $S_{12}$.\n    As we established earlier, all generators of $G$ are even permutations, so $G \\le A_{12}$.\n    Therefore, we can conclude that $G = A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Schur Multiplier of G**\n\nThe Schur multiplier of a group $G$, denoted $M(G)$, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. The Schur multipliers for many finite simple groups are known.\n*   The group $G$ is the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n*   The Schur multiplier of the alternating group $A_n$ for $n \\ge 4$ and $n \\neq 6, 7$ is the cyclic group of order 2, $Z_2$.\n*   For $n=12$, this condition holds. So, the Schur multiplier of $G=A_{12}$ is $A = M(A_{12}) = Z_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of proper subgroups of A, up to isomorphism**\n\nThe Schur multiplier is $A = Z_2$, the cyclic group of order 2. Let's list its subgroups.\n*   The elements of $Z_2$ are $\\{0, 1\\}$ with addition modulo 2.\n*   The subgroups of any group must contain the identity element (which is 0 here).\n*   The possible subgroups are:\n    1.  The trivial subgroup: $\\{0\\}$. The order of this subgroup is 1.\n    2.  The group itself: $\\{0, 1\\} = Z_2$. The order of this subgroup is 2.\n*   A proper subgroup of a group $A$ is a subgroup $H$ such that $H \\neq A$.\n*   The only proper subgroup of $A=Z_2$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$.\n*   The question asks for the number of proper subgroups *up to isomorphism*.\n*   The only proper subgroup is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$, which is isomorphic to the abstract trivial group $Z_1$.\n*   Thus, there is only one isomorphism class for the proper subgroups of $A$.\n*   The number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism is 1."
