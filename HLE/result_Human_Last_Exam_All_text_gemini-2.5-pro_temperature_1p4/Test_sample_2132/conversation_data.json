    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactant and Reaction**\nThe starting material is 2-chlorocyclohexanone. The reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement, which is a base-catalyzed rearrangement of an α-haloketone.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Structure of the Product**\nThe Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone proceeds through a cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). Subsequent nucleophilic attack by the base (e.g., hydroxide or alkoxide) on the carbonyl carbon, followed by the opening of the strained cyclopropane ring, leads to a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid or ester functional group.\n\nWithout specified reagents, the most fundamental product is the carboxylic acid, which would be formed using a base like sodium hydroxide followed by an acidic workup. Therefore, the product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is a cyclopentane ring attached to a carboxyl group (-COOH). Its chemical formula is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Böttcher Molecular Complexity Index**\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC) is a topological index calculated using the following formula:\n`BMC = (A * B) / C`\nWhere:\n*   **A** is the number of non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n*   **B** is the number of bonds (connections or edges) between these non-hydrogen atoms. According to the original definition, multiple bonds (e.g., double or triple bonds) are counted as a single connection.\n*   **C** is the number of connected components in the molecule. For a single molecule, C is always 1.\n\nFor a single, connected molecule, the formula simplifies to `BMC = A * B`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Parameters for Cyclopentanecarboxylic Acid**\n\n*   **Calculate A (Number of non-hydrogen atoms):**\n    The molecule is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n    Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 6\n    Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 2\n    Total non-hydrogen atoms, `A = 6 + 2 = 8`.\n\n*   **Calculate C (Number of components):**\n    Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is a single, continuous molecule.\n    Therefore, `C = 1`.\n\n*   **Calculate B (Number of connections between non-hydrogen atoms):**\n    We need to count the connections in the hydrogen-suppressed molecular graph.\n    1.  The cyclopentane ring consists of 5 carbon atoms connected in a cycle, which gives **5** C-C connections.\n    2.  The carboxyl group is attached to the cyclopentane ring, which adds **1** C-C connection.\n    3.  Within the carboxyl group (-COOH), the central carbon atom is connected to two oxygen atoms. One is a C=O double bond and the other is a C-O single bond. Each of these counts as one connection. This gives **2** connections (one C-O and another C-O).\n    Total connections, `B = 5 (ring) + 1 (attachment) + 2 (carboxyl) = 8`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity**\nUsing the values calculated in the previous step:\n`A = 8`\n`B = 8`\n`C = 1`\n\n`BMC = (A * B) / C`\n`BMC = (8 * 8) / 1`\n`BMC = 64`\n\n<<<64>>>"
