    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Terminology\nThe \"generalized Markov numbers\", in the context of Diophantine approximation and continued fractions, refer to the values in the Markov spectrum. The notation \\(m_{p/q}\\) indicates that this Markov number is associated with the rational number \\(p/q\\). The question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with\" this number. This is the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\), whose period is palindromic and which determines the value in the Markov spectrum.\n\nThe value in the spectrum (also called the Lagrange number) is given by \\(L(\\alpha) = [\\overline{P}] + [0; \\overline{P^R}]\\), where \\(P\\) is the periodic part of the continued fraction of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(P^R\\) is its reverse. For the numbers in the Markov spectrum below 3, the period \\(P\\) is a palindrome, so \\(P = P^R\\).\n\nThe task is to find the palindromic block of integers \\(P\\) corresponding to the rational number \\(p/q = 4/7\\), which then defines the associated continued fraction \\([0; \\overline{P}]\\).\n\n### Step 2: Find the Continued Fraction of the Rational Number\nFirst, we compute the continued fraction of the given rational number, \\(4/7\\).\n\\[ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + 1/3}} \\]\nSo, the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). Let's denote the coefficients as \\(c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3\\).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Algorithm to Construct the Palindromic Period\nThere is a known algorithm, developed by Frobenius, Cusick, and others, to construct the palindromic period of the continued fraction of \\(\\alpha_{p/q}\\) from the continued fraction of \\(p/q = [0; c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n]\\), provided that the last coefficient \\(c_n \\ge 2\\).\n\nLet \\(p/q = [0; c_1, \\dots, c_n]\\) with \\(c_n \\ge 2\\).\nLet \\(S\\) be the sequence of coefficients excluding the last one: \\(S = (c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{n-1})\\).\nLet \\(S^R\\) be the reverse of the sequence \\(S\\): \\(S^R = (c_{n-1}, \\dots, c_2, c_1)\\).\n\nThe algorithm to generate the palindromic period \\(P\\) is as follows:\n\\[ P = (c_n, S^R, c_n-2, S) \\]\nIf \\(c_n - 2 = 0\\), the middle term is omitted.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Algorithm to \\(4/7\\)\nFor \\(p/q = 4/7\\), the continued fraction is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\nWe have \\(n=3\\), and the coefficients are \\(c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3\\).\nThe condition \\(c_n \\ge 2\\) is satisfied, as \\(c_3=3\\).\n\nThe sequence \\(S\\) is \\((c_1, c_2) = (1, 1)\\).\nThe reverse sequence \\(S^R\\) is \\((1, 1)\\).\nThe middle term is \\(c_n-2 = c_3-2 = 3-2 = 1\\).\n\nNow we assemble the period \\(P\\):\n\\[ P = (c_3, S^R, c_3-2, S) = (3, (1, 1), 1, (1, 1)) = (3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) \\]\n\nThis sequence is a palindrome, as required.\n\n### Step 5: State the Associated Continued Fraction\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is the one whose period is the sequence \\(P\\) we just found. By convention, this number, \\(\\alpha_{4/7}\\), lies in \\((0,1)\\) and is purely periodic. Thus, its continued fraction representation is \\([0; \\overline{P}]\\).\n\nSubstituting the period \\(P = (3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\\), we get the final answer.\n\nThe continued fraction is:\n\\[ [0; \\overline{3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}] \\]\n\nThis is a complete description of the continued fraction associated with \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\n<<<[0; \\overline{3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}]>>>"
