    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the protein sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Problem\nThe task is to take a given nucleotide sequence, which is a segment from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), and translate it into a protein sequence. The key is that an ORF is a continuous sequence of codons that does not contain any stop codons. Since this is from the *middle* of an ORF, we must find the reading frame that is \"open\" (free of stop codons).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Reading Frames\nA codon is a set of three nucleotides. For any given DNA sequence, there are three possible forward reading frames, starting at the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd nucleotide.\n\n*   **Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide (`g`). Codons are `gga`, `cat`, `tgt`, etc.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide (`g`). Codons are `gac`, `att`, `gtt`, etc.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide (`a`). Codons are `aca`, `ttg`, `ttg`, etc.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Reading Frame for Stop Codons\nWe will examine each frame for the presence of stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). The frame that contains a stop codon is not a valid ORF.\n\n*   **Frame 1 Analysis:**\n    *   Grouping: `gga cat tgt tgt` **`tag`**`...`\n    *   Result: A **TAG** stop codon is found at the 5th position. Therefore, Frame 1 is incorrect.\n\n*   **Frame 3 Analysis:**\n    *   Grouping: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act` **`tga`**`...`\n    *   Result: A **TGA** stop codon is found at the 8th position. Therefore, Frame 3 is also incorrect.\n\n*   **Frame 2 Analysis:**\n    *   Grouping: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga gag tgg...`\n    *   Result: A thorough scan of all codons in this frame reveals no stop codons. This is the only valid Open Reading Frame.\n\n### Step 4: Translate the Correct Reading Frame (Frame 2)\nNow, we translate the codons from Frame 2 into the one-letter amino acid code.\n\n1.  `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n2.  `att` -> **I** (Isoleucine)\n3.  `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n4.  `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n5.  `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n6.  `gaa` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n7.  `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n8.  `ttg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n9.  `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n10. `gga` -> **G** (Glycine)\n11. `acg` -> **T** (Threonine)\n12. `gtg` -> **V** (Valine)\n13. `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n14. `ttt` -> **F** (Phenylalanine)\n15. `tca` -> **S** (Serine)\n16. `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n17. `tct` -> **S** (Serine)\n18. `tta` -> **L** (Leucine)\n19. `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n20. `tac` -> **Y** (Tyrosine)\n21. `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n22. `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n23. `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n24. `ctt` -> **L** (Leucine)\n25. `aac` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n26. `agt` -> **S** (Serine)\n27. `gtc` -> **V** (Valine)\n28. `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n29. `gct` -> **A** (Alanine)\n30. `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n31. `cga` -> **R** (Arginine)\n32. `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n33. `tgg` -> **W** (Tryptophan)\n\n### Step 5: Final Protein Sequence\nAssembling the translated amino acids gives the final protein sequence.\n\n*   **Frame:** The correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n*   **Protein Sequence:** DIVVSSEDLNGTVEKFSSSLLPYPNNLNSVLAEREW\n\n<<<DIVVSSEDLNGTVEKFSSSLLPYPNNLNSVLAEREW>>>"
