    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** The question provides several key pieces of information about a person referred to as \"HE\" and \"HIS work,\" based on an interpretation by Veronika Campan.\n    *   **Interpreter:** Veronika Campan. She is an Old Testament scholar known for her work on the structure and theology of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments).\n    *   **The Work:** The context points towards a foundational legal or religious text. The mention of a \"prohibition against representation\" and rules about \"material possessions\" strongly suggests the Ten Commandments.\n    *   **Prohibition against representation:** This is a direct reference to the Second Commandment, which forbids making graven images or idols (\"You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything...\").\n    *   **Another's material possessions:** This refers to the commandments against theft and covetousness, particularly the Tenth Commandment, which lists a neighbor's possessions (\"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor\").\n    *   **\"At the end of HIS work\":** The Tenth Commandment is the final commandment in the Decalogue, placing it at the very end of this specific work.\n    *   **\"Ignoring the prohibition against representation\":** This is the core of Campan's interpretation. The Second Commandment forbids making a representation of anything. However, the Tenth Commandment, in order to specify what should not be coveted, creates a *verbal representation* or a mental list of the neighbor's world (house, wife, servants, ox, donkey). In doing so, it has to \"ignore\" the absolute nature of the prohibition against representation found earlier in the text. It uses verbal imagery to define the scope of the law.\n\n2.  **Identify \"HE\":** The text being discussed is the Ten Commandments. In the biblical tradition (primarily in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy), the human figure who receives the commandments from God and delivers them as law to the people of Israel is the prophet Moses. He is the central lawgiver in this context.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Information:** Veronika Campan's analysis of the Ten Commandments (the work of Moses) posits that the final commandment (about material possessions) creates a detailed verbal image of those possessions. This act of verbal representation stands in tension with, or \"naturally ignores,\" the sweeping prohibition against making representations found in the Second Commandment. Therefore, \"HE,\" the human agent behind this work, is Moses. The question asks for his full name.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The full name of the individual who, according to the biblical narrative, delivered this work is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
