    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\nThe query asks for the title of a specific film based on a very detailed scene description. Let's break down the key elements required for a correct answer:\n1.  **Film Type:** Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Prop:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Element\n*   **\"Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio\":** This eliminates independent films with very limited distribution, foreign films, and TV shows. The film should be from a recognizable studio like Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount, 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), Sony/Columbia, etc., or one of their major subsidiaries.\n*   **\"A teenager\":** The character performing the action must be in their teenage years, which is central to the plot of many \"coming-of-age\" films.\n*   **\"A pink bike\":** This is a very specific visual detail. It's not just any bike; its color is pink. This is a strong clue that helps narrow down the possibilities significantly.\n*   **\"Pedal directly toward an oncoming car\":** This is the key action of the scene. It's a memorable and unusual action. It implies a moment of confrontation, naivety, or quirky behavior, rather than a typical traffic accident.\n\n### Step 3: Brainstorm and Evaluate Potential Films\nLet's consider films that feature teenagers and bikes.\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial***: Features teenagers on bikes, but there is no prominent pink bike, and the most famous scene involves flying *over* cars/roadblocks, not riding *toward* a car head-on.\n*   ***The Goonies***: Features kids and teens on bikes, but no memorable pink bike or a scene matching the description.\n*   ***It* (2017):** The \"Losers' Club\" are all teens on bikes. However, none of their signature bikes are pink, and while they have confrontations involving cars (like with Henry Bowers), the specific action of one of them deliberately pedaling head-on toward a car on a pink bike does not occur.\n*   ***Napoleon Dynamite* (2004):** Let's check this film against our criteria.\n    1.  **Major Studio?** It was produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures, a subsidiary of 20th Century Fox, a major studio. This fits.\n    2.  **Teenager?** The film's main characters are all teenagers, including Deb. This fits.\n    3.  **Pink Bike?** The character Deb is known for riding a light pink (or lavender-pink) Huffy-style bicycle with a front basket. This is a perfect match.\n    4.  **Action?** There is a distinct scene where Napoleon and Pedro are driving in Uncle Rico's van. They are forced to slam on the brakes because Deb is in the middle of the road, pedaling her pink bike directly at their van to give them a flyer for her \"Glamour Shots\" business. This action exactly matches the description.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe film that precisely matches all the details provided in the question—a Hollywood feature film from a major studio subsidiary, featuring a teenager (Deb) on a pink bike who pedals directly toward an oncoming car (Uncle Rico's van)—is *Napoleon Dynamite*.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
