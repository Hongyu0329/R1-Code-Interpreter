    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hurwitz number.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the Hurwitz number that counts the number of ramified covers from the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{P}^1$ to itself, with the following properties:\n*   The degree of the cover is $d=7$.\n*   There are exactly four branch points.\n*   The ramification profiles over these four branch points are given by the partitions of 7: $\\mu_1=(4,3)$, $\\mu_2=(5,2)$, $\\mu_3=(2,1,1,1,1,1)$, and $\\mu_4=(2,1,1,1,1,1)$.\n\n### **Step 2: Translating to a Permutation Group Problem**\n\nA ramified cover of degree $d$ with $k$ branch points is determined by its monodromy representation. This is a homomorphism from the fundamental group of the base space (punctured at the branch points) to the symmetric group $S_d$.\n\nThis translates to finding the number of tuples of permutations $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ in the symmetric group $S_7$ that satisfy:\n1.  **Product-One Condition:** $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_4 = 1$ (the identity permutation).\n2.  **Cycle Type Condition:** Each permutation $\\sigma_i$ belongs to the conjugacy class $C_i$ in $S_7$ corresponding to the given ramification profile $\\mu_i$.\n    *   $\\sigma_1 \\in C_{(4,3)}$\n    *   $\\sigma_2 \\in C_{(5,2)}$\n    *   $\\sigma_3 \\in C_{(2,1^5)}$ (a transposition)\n    *   $\\sigma_4 \\in C_{(2,1^5)}$ (a transposition)\n3.  **Transitivity Condition:** The subgroup $G = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$ must act transitively on the set $\\{1, 2, ..., 7\\}$. This corresponds to the cover being connected.\n\nThe \"Hurwitz number counting ramified covers\" for fixed, ordered branch points is the total number of such tuples, assuming the automorphism group of the cover is trivial.\n\n### **Step 3: Checking the Transitivity Condition**\n\nAn action of a group $G$ on a set of size $d=7$ is intransitive if there exists a proper, non-empty invariant subset of size $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 6\\}$. For such a subset to be invariant under $G$, it must be invariant under each generator $\\sigma_i$. This implies that the cycle type of each $\\sigma_i$ must be compatible with a partition of the set $\\{1, ..., 7\\}$ into subsets of size $k$ and $7-k$. Since $d=7$ is prime, we only need to check for $k=1, 2, 3$.\n\n*   **Case $k=1$ (or $k=6$):** The permutations must have a common fixed point. The cycle types (4,3) and (5,2) have no fixed points. Thus, there can be no invariant subset of size 1 or 6.\n*   **Case $k=2$ (or $k=5$):** The permutations must preserve a common subset of size 2. A permutation of type (4,3) cannot preserve a subset of size 2, as its cycle lengths (4 and 3) cannot be partitioned to form sums of 2 and 5.\n*   **Case $k=3$ (or $k=4$):** The permutations must preserve a common subset of size 3. A permutation of type (5,2) cannot preserve a subset of size 3, as its cycle lengths (5 and 2) cannot be partitioned to form sums of 3 and 4.\n\nSince there is no possible size for a non-trivial invariant subset that is compatible with all four required cycle types, any tuple of permutations satisfying the conditions must generate a transitive group. Therefore, we only need to count the total number of tuples satisfying the product-one and cycle-type conditions.\n\n### **Step 4: Using Character Theory to Count Tuples**\n\nThe number of tuples $(\\sigma_1, \\ldots, \\sigma_k)$ with $\\sigma_i \\in C_i$ and $\\sigma_1\\cdots\\sigma_k=1$ is given by the Frobenius-Schur formula:\n$$ N = \\frac{|C_1||C_2||C_3||C_4|}{|S_7|} \\sum_{\\chi} \\frac{\\chi(c_1)\\chi(c_2)\\chi(c_3)\\chi(c_4)}{\\chi(1)^2} $$\nwhere the sum is over all irreducible characters $\\chi$ of $S_7$, $c_i$ is an element from class $C_i$, and $\\chi(1)$ is the dimension of the character $\\chi$. Since $C_3 = C_4$, we can write $\\chi(c_3)\\chi(c_4) = \\chi(c_3)^2$.\n\n**4a. Calculate Conjugacy Class Sizes**\nThe size of a conjugacy class for a partition $d = 1^{m_1} 2^{m_2} \\cdots$ is $|C| = d! / (\\prod_i i^{m_i} m_i!)$. For $d=7$, $|S_7|=7!=5040$.\n*   $|C_{(4,3)}| = \\frac{7!}{4^1 \\cdot 1! \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 1!} = \\frac{5040}{12} = 420$.\n*   $|C_{(5,2)}| = \\frac{7!}{5^1 \\cdot 1! \\cdot 2^1 \\cdot 1!} = \\frac{5040}{10} = 504$.\n*   $|C_{(2,1^5)}| = \\frac{7!}{2^1 \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1^5 \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2} = 21$.\n\n**4b. Use the Character Table of $S_7$**\nWe look up the character values for the relevant conjugacy classes. Many terms in the sum will be zero because the character value is zero for at least one of the classes. The non-zero contributions come from the following irreducible representations (labeled by their partitions $\\lambda$):\n\n| Partition $\\lambda$ | Dim $d_\\lambda$ | $\\chi_\\lambda(4,3)$ | $\\chi_\\lambda(5,2)$ | $\\chi_\\lambda(2,1^5)$ | Contribution Term: $\\frac{\\chi(c_1)\\chi(c_2)\\chi(c_3)^2}{d_\\lambda^2}$ |\n|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| [7]                 | 1               | 1                 | 1                 | 1                   | $(1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1^2) / 1^2 = 1$                       |\n| [4,3]               | 14              | -2                | -1                | 2                   | $(-2 \\cdot -1 \\cdot 2^2) / 14^2 = 8 / 196 = 2/49$         |\n| [3,3,1]             | 21              | 1                 | -1                | -3                  | $(1 \\cdot -1 \\cdot (-3)^2) / 21^2 = -9 / 441 = -1/49$     |\n| [3,2,2]             | 21              | 1                 | 1                 | 3                   | $(1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3^2) / 21^2 = 9 / 441 = 1/49$         |\n| $[1^7]$ (sign char) | 1               | 1                 | 1                 | -1                  | $(1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1)^2) / 1^2 = 1$                    |\n\nAll other irreducible characters of $S_7$ have a value of 0 on at least one of the conjugacy classes $(4,3)$ or $(5,2)$, so their contribution to the sum is zero.\n\n**4c. Calculate the Sum**\nSum of terms = $1 + \\frac{2}{49} - \\frac{1}{49} + \\frac{1}{49} + 1 = 2 + \\frac{2-1+1}{49} = 2 + \\frac{2}{49} = \\frac{98+2}{49} = \\frac{100}{49}$.\n\n**4d. Calculate the Final Number of Tuples**\n$$ N = \\frac{420 \\cdot 504 \\cdot 21^2}{5040} \\times \\frac{100}{49} $$\n$$ N = \\frac{420 \\cdot 504 \\cdot 441}{5040} \\times \\frac{100}{49} $$\nSimplify the expression:\n$$ N = \\left(\\frac{420}{5040}\\right) \\cdot 504 \\cdot 441 \\cdot \\frac{100}{49} = \\frac{1}{12} \\cdot 504 \\cdot 441 \\cdot \\frac{100}{49} $$\n$$ N = 42 \\cdot 441 \\cdot \\frac{100}{49} $$\nSince $441 = 9 \\cdot 49$:\n$$ N = 42 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 100 = 378 \\cdot 100 = 37800 $$\n\n### **Step 5: Concluding the Count**\n\nThe number of such tuples of permutations is 37,800. We showed that any such tuple generates a transitive group. For a cover of a prime degree $d=7$, any transitive monodromy group is also primitive. A primitive group of degree $d$ containing a transposition (which our group does, e.g. $\\sigma_3$) must be the full symmetric group $S_d$.\nThe automorphism group of the cover is the centralizer of the monodromy group in $S_d$. Here, this is $Z_{S_7}(S_7)$, which is the trivial group.\nTherefore, the number of non-isomorphic covers is equal to the number of valid tuples.\n\nThe Hurwitz number counting these covers for fixed, ordered branch points is 37,800."
