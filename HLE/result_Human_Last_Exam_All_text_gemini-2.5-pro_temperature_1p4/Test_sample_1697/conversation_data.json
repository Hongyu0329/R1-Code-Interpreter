    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group which is in turn connected to a nitrogen atom (-C(=O)N-).\n*   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. So the amide group is -CON(CH₂CH₃)₂. Let's place this group at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n*   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is located at position 3 (meta position) relative to the amide group.\n\nSo, the structure has an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at position C1 and a dimethylamino group at position C3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Metalation)**\nThe first set of reagents are **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium)**, **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine)**, and **THF** (the solvent).\n*   **sec-BuLi** is a very strong base.\n*   **TMEDA** is a chelating agent that complexes with the lithium ion (Li⁺), breaking up sec-BuLi aggregates and increasing its basicity.\n*   When a strong base like sec-BuLi is used with an aromatic compound that has suitable functional groups, a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction occurs. In this reaction, the functional group directs the base to deprotonate a proton from an adjacent (ortho) carbon atom. The functional group that does this is called a Directing Metalation Group (DMG).\n*   Our starting material has two potential DMGs:\n    1.  The **N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂)** at C1. This is a very powerful DMG. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C6.\n    2.  The **dimethylamino group (-NMe₂)** at C3. This is also a good DMG, although weaker than the amide. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions, which are C2 and C4.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Regioselectivity of Deprotonation**\nWe need to determine which proton will be removed.\n*   The C2 position is ortho to both the strong director (-CONEt₂) and the weaker director (-NMe₂). This is a **cooperative or synergistic effect**, making the proton at C2 exceptionally acidic and the prime target for deprotonation.\n*   The C6 position is ortho to the strong director (-CONEt₂) but meta to the weaker director (-NMe₂).\n*   The C4 position is ortho to the weaker director (-NMe₂) and para to the strong director (-CONEt₂).\nDue to the powerful directing ability of the amide group and the synergistic effect at C2, the deprotonation will occur selectively and almost exclusively at the **C2 position**.\n\nThe product of this step is an aryllithium intermediate: **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Electrophilic Quench)**\nThe second reagent added is **methyl iodide (CH₃I)**.\n*   The aryllithium intermediate formed in Step 2 is a strong nucleophile, with the negative charge and electron density localized on the C2 carbon atom (where the lithium is attached).\n*   Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The carbon atom of the methyl group is electron-deficient due to the attached electronegative iodine atom.\n*   The nucleophilic C2 atom of the aryllithium attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I in an Sₙ2-type reaction, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and displacing the iodide ion (I⁻).\n\n**Careful Point 2: Site of Alkylation**\nThe reaction between the organolithium and the electrophile is highly specific. The new group (methyl, in this case) attaches exactly where the lithium atom was. So, the methyl group will be introduced at the C2 position.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\nCombining the results of the steps:\n1.  We start with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n2.  Selective deprotonation occurs at the C2 position.\n3.  The resulting aryllithium is treated with methyl iodide, which adds a methyl group at the C2 position.\n\nThe original functional groups (-CONEt₂ and -NMe₂) remain intact. A new methyl group (-CH₃) is added to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\nThe final compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
