The conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point to exist are established by applying fixed-point theorems to a combined operator `T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x))` on the product space `W = X × Y × Z`. There are two main sets of sufficient conditions:
1.  **For a unique fixed point:** `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces, and the combined operator `T` must be a contraction mapping on `W`.
2.  **For at least one fixed point:** `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty, compact, and convex subsets of a Banach space, and the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must be continuous.
