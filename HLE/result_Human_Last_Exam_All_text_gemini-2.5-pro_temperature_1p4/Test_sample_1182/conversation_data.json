    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the curve equation and its initial reduction.**\nThe curve $C$ is given by the equation:\n$y^2 = f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We want to study its reduction over the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and the residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nWe reduce the equation modulo 2:\n$y^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x^5 + 0 \\cdot x^4 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + x^2 + 0 \\cdot x \\pmod{2}$\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this is equivalent to $y^2 - x^2 = (y-x)^2 = 0$, so $y=x$.\nThe initial reduction is a double line, which is a non-reduced, singular curve. This means the curve has \"bad reduction\" with respect to this model. To find the stable reduction, we need to find a better model of the curve.\n\n**Careful point 1:** The initial model is not regular, and its special fiber is not semistable. We need to perform transformations to find a regular model whose special fiber is a semistable curve. A stable curve can only have ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities.\n\n**Step 2: Apply a sequence of transformations to find a better model.**\nThe goal is to find a new model, isomorphic to the original curve over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, but which is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and has better reduction properties. This is often done by a sequence of admissible coordinate changes (blow-ups).\n\nLet's try the substitution $x = 2x_1$ and $y = 2y_1$. This corresponds to looking at the curve in a different chart after a blow-up. This is an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nSubstitute these into the original equation:\n$(2y_1)^2 = 8(2x_1) + (2x_1)^2 + 4(2x_1)^3 + 4(2x_1)^4 + 8(2x_1)^5$\n$4y_1^2 = 16x_1 + 4x_1^2 + 32x_1^3 + 64x_1^4 + 256x_1^5$\nDivide the entire equation by 4:\n$y_1^2 = 4x_1 + x_1^2 + 8x_1^3 + 16x_1^4 + 64x_1^5$\nThis gives a new model for the curve, defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's call this model $C_1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reduction of the new model $C_1$.**\nReducing the equation for $C_1$ modulo 2, we get:\n$y_1^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x_1 + x_1^2 + 0 \\cdot x_1^3 + 0 \\cdot x_1^4 + 0 \\cdot x_1^5 \\pmod{2}$\n$y_1^2 \\equiv x_1^2 \\pmod{2}$\nThis reduction is still a double line ($y_1=x_1$), which is singular. The model $C_1$ is still not the stable model.\n\n**Step 4: Apply a second transformation.**\nThe singularity of the reduction $y_1^2=x_1^2$ is along the line $y_1=x_1$. This suggests a transformation of the form $y_1 = x_1 + 2z_1$. The factor of 2 (the uniformizer of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$) is crucial. Substitute this into the equation for $C_1$:\n$(x_1 + 2z_1)^2 = 4x_1 + x_1^2 + 8x_1^3 + 16x_1^4 + 64x_1^5$\n$x_1^2 + 4x_1z_1 + 4z_1^2 = 4x_1 + x_1^2 + 8x_1^3 + 16x_1^4 + 64x_1^5$\nSubtract $x_1^2$ from both sides:\n$4x_1z_1 + 4z_1^2 = 4x_1 + 8x_1^3 + 16x_1^4 + 64x_1^5$\nDivide the entire equation by 4:\n$x_1z_1 + z_1^2 = x_1 + 2x_1^3 + 4x_1^4 + 16x_1^5$\nRearranging, we get a new model $C_2$:\n$z_1^2 + x_1z_1 - (x_1 + 2x_1^3 + 4x_1^4 + 16x_1^5) = 0$\nThis model is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and is isomorphic to our original curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Careful point 2:** This sequence of transformations is a standard procedure for resolving singularities of this type. The key is to recognize the form of the singular reduction and apply the appropriate substitution.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the reduction of the final model $C_2$.**\nLet's reduce the equation for $C_2$ modulo 2:\n$z_1^2 + x_1z_1 - (x_1 + 0 \\cdot x_1^3 + \\dots) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n$z_1^2 + x_1z_1 - x_1 = 0$, or $z_1^2 + x_1z_1 + x_1 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nLet's check if this reduced curve $\\tilde{C_2}$ is smooth. We use the Jacobian criterion. Let $G(x_1, z_1) = z_1^2 + x_1z_1 + x_1$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x_1} = z_1 + 1$\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z_1} = 2z_1 + x_1 = x_1$ (in $\\mathbb{F}_2$)\nFor a singular point, both partial derivatives must be zero.\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial z_1} = x_1 = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x_1} = z_1 + 1 = 0 \\implies z_1 = 1$\nSo, the only potential singular point is $(x_1, z_1) = (0, 1)$.\nNow we must check if this point lies on the curve $\\tilde{C_2}$:\n$G(0, 1) = 1^2 + (0)(1) + 0 = 1$.\nSince $G(0,1) \\neq 0$, the point $(0,1)$ is not on the curve. Therefore, the curve $\\tilde{C_2}$ has no singular points; it is smooth.\n\n**Careful point 3:** The model $C_2$ we found has a smooth special fiber. A curve that possesses a smooth proper model over the ring of integers is said to have \"good reduction\".\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the number of double points.**\nThe stable reduction of a curve is a semistable curve that is birationally equivalent to the original curve. If a curve has good reduction, its stable model is a smooth curve. Specifically, the smooth special fiber of the model $C_2$ is the stable reduction of $C$.\n\nA smooth curve, by definition, has no singular points. A double point is a type of singular point. Therefore, the stable reduction of this curve has no double points.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1. The initial reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ mod 2 is $y^2=x^2$, which is singular.\n2. We performed a sequence of variable changes ($x=2x_1, y=2y_1$ followed by $y_1=x_1+2z_1$) to find a new model for the curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n3. The new model's equation is $z_1^2 + x_1z_1 - (x_1 + 2x_1^3 + 4x_1^4 + 16x_1^5) = 0$.\n4. The reduction of this new model modulo 2 is $z_1^2 + x_1z_1 + x_1 = 0$.\n5. This reduced curve is smooth.\n6. A curve that has a smooth model has good reduction, and its stable reduction is this smooth curve itself.\n7. A smooth curve has no double points.\n\nThe number of double points is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
