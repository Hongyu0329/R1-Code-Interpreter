    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Group and the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the number of involutions in the group G = PSU(4, 997).\n*   An **involution** is an element `x` of order 2, meaning `x^2 = 1` and `x \\neq 1`.\n*   The group **PSU(n, q)**, the Projective Special Unitary group, is standard notation for the group constructed over the finite field of order `q^2`, i.e., `GF(q^2)`. In this case, `n=4` and `q=997`.\n*   PSU(n, q^2) is defined as the quotient group `SU(n, q^2) / Z(SU(n, q^2))`, where `SU(n, q^2)` is the Special Unitary group and `Z` is its center.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Involutions in PSU to Elements in SU**\n\nLet `Z = Z(SU(4, q^2))` be the center of `SU(4, q^2)`. An element `gZ` in `PSU` is an involution if and only if `(gZ)^2` is the identity element in `PSU` (`Z`), and `gZ` is not the identity itself.\n*   `(gZ)^2 = Z` implies `g^2 \\in Z`.\n*   `gZ \\neq Z` implies `g \\notin Z`.\n\nFirst, we must determine the center `Z`. The center consists of scalar matrices `λI` that are in `SU(4, q^2)`. This requires two conditions on `λ`:\n1.  `det(λI) = λ^4 = 1` (for the \"Special\" part).\n2.  `λI` must be in the unitary group `U(4, q^2)`, which means `λ` must satisfy `λ * λ^q = λ^{q+1} = 1`.\n\nThe order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\nHere, `n=4` and `q=997`. So, `q+1 = 998`.\n`d = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nThe center `Z` has order 2. Since `q` is odd, `GF(q^2)` has characteristic different from 2. The elements of order dividing 2 are `1` and `-1`. We can check that `-1` is in the center: `(-1)^4=1` and `(-1)^{q+1}=(-1)^{998}=1`. Thus, `Z = \\{I, -I\\}`.\n\nThe preimages `g \\in SU(4, q^2)` of involutions in `PSU` must satisfy:\n*   `g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}`\n*   `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}`\n\nThis gives two cases for the preimages `g`:\n1.  `g^2 = I` and `g` is not central (i.e., `g \\neq I` and `g \\neq -I`). These are the non-central involutions of `SU(4, q^2)`.\n2.  `g^2 = -I`. Such an element `g` cannot be central, as `I^2=I \\neq -I` and `(-I)^2=I \\neq -I`.\n\nThe total number of involutions in `PSU(4, q^2)` will be the total number of such preimages divided by the order of the center, `|Z|=2`.\n\n**Step 3: Count Preimages of Type `g^2 = -I`**\n\nLet's analyze the possibility of `g \\in SU(4, q^2)` with `g^2 = -I`.\n*   Any eigenvalue `λ` of `g` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`.\n*   For `g` to be in the unitary group `U(4, q^2)`, any eigenvalue `λ` must also satisfy the condition `λ^{q+1} = 1`.\n*   Let `j` be a root of `x^2 = -1`. The eigenvalues of `g` are `\\pm j`. We must have `j^{q+1}=1`.\n*   The base field is `GF(q)` with `q = 997`. We check if `-1` is a square in this field. `q = 997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1`, so `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`. This implies that `x^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod q` has a solution in `GF(q)`. Therefore, `j \\in GF(q)`.\n*   If `j \\in GF(q)`, then `j^q = j`.\n*   The condition `j^{q+1}=1` becomes `j^q \\cdot j = j \\cdot j = j^2 = -1`.\n*   So we need `-1 = 1`, which implies `2=0`. This is false, as the characteristic is `q=997`.\n*   Conclusion: There are **no elements** `g` in `U(4, 997^2)` such that `g^2 = -I`. The set of preimages of this type is empty.\n\n**Step 4: Count Preimages of Type `g^2 = I` (Non-central Involutions)**\n\nWe need to count the elements `g \\in SU(4, q^2)` such that `g^2=I` and `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}`.\n*   An involution `g` in a unitary group is diagonalizable with eigenvalues `+1` and `-1`. It is defined by the dimension of its `-1`-eigenspace, which we denote by `k`.\n*   For `g` to be in `SU(4, q^2)`, its determinant must be 1. `det(g) = (-1)^k = 1`, which means `k` must be an even integer.\n*   Since `g \\neq I`, we must have `k > 0`. The possible values for `k` are `k=2` and `k=4`.\n    *   If `k=4`, `g` is conjugate to `diag(-1,-1,-1,-1) = -I`. This means `g = -I`, which is in the center. We must exclude this case.\n    *   If `k=2`, `g` is conjugate to `diag(-1,-1,1,1)`. Such an element is not a scalar matrix, so it is not in the center. This is precisely the set of elements we are looking for.\n*   So, the preimages we seek form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q^2)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Size of the Conjugacy Class**\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class of involutions with `k=2` in `U(4, q^2)` is given by the formula:\n`N_2 = |U(4, q^2)| / |C_{U(4, q^2)}(t)|`, where `t` is a representative of the class. The centralizer `C_{U(4, q^2)}(t)` is isomorphic to `U(2, q^2) \\times U(2, q^2)`.\n`N_2 = |U(4, q^2)| / (|U(2, q^2)|)^2`.\n\nThe order of `U(m, q^2)` is `q^{m(m-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^m (q^i - (-1)^i)`.\n*   `|U(4, q^2)| = q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n*   `|U(2, q^2)| = q^1 (q+1)(q^2-1)`\n\n`N_2 = (q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)) / (q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2`\n`N_2 = q^4 (q^3+1)(q^4-1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1))`\nUsing the identities `q^3+1=(q+1)(q^2-q+1)` and `q^4-1=(q^2-1)(q^2+1)`, we simplify:\n`N_2 = q^4 (q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n\nThe size of this conjugacy class is the same in `SU(4, q^2)` as it is in `U(4, q^2)`. Thus, the number of preimages is `N_2`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of preimages is `N_2 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\nEach involution in `PSU(4, q^2)` corresponds to a coset `gZ = \\{g, -g\\}`. Since `g` is not central, `g \\neq -g`, so each coset has `|Z|=2` distinct elements.\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is the number of preimages divided by the size of the center:\nNumber = `N_2 / 2 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) / 2`.\n\nNow we substitute `q = 997`:\n*   `q^2 = 997^2 = 994,009`\n*   `q^2 + 1 = 994,010`\n*   `q^2 - q + 1 = 994,009 - 997 + 1 = 993,013`\n*   `q^4 = (994,009)^2 = 988,053,892,081`\n\nNumber = `(988,053,892,081 \\times 993,013 \\times 994,010) / 2`\nNumber = `988,053,892,081 \\times 993,013 \\times 497,005`\nNumber = `487,652,436,423,719,001,353,665`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Notation:** The notation PSU(n, q) conventionally refers to the group constructed from `GF(q^2)`.\n2.  **Center Calculation:** The size of the center `Z(SU(n, q^2))` is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`, a crucial parameter.\n3.  **Lifting to the Covering Group:** Involutions in the quotient group `G/Z` arise from preimages `g` in `G` where `g^2 \\in Z` but `g \\notin Z`.\n4.  **Existence of Elements:** The existence of elements `g` with `g^2 = -I` in `U(n, q^2)` depends on the property of `q` modulo 4. For `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, these elements do not exist.\n5.  **Conjugacy Classes:** The involutions are partitioned into conjugacy classes. We needed to identify which classes in `SU(4, q^2)` contribute to the count. Only the non-central involutions with determinant 1 were relevant.\n6.  **Final Division:** The total number of valid preimages must be divided by the order of the center to get the number of involutions in the projective group.\n\nThe final answer is the result of the calculation.\n\n<<<487652436423719001353665>>>"
