    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nFirst, we must break down the key components of the user's query:\n*   **Subject:** A specific \"Christian theologian.\"\n*   **Action:** \"first developed specialized terminology.\"\n*   **Purpose of Terminology:** To \"describe changes in the laws of nature.\"\n*   **Specific Applications:** The terminology must be applicable to two distinct theological concepts:\n    1.  The virgin birth of Jesus.\n    2.  Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall of Man.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates and Key Concepts**\nThe question links theology with the philosophy of nature and miracles. This points toward major systematic theologians who sought to create a coherent worldview.\n*   **\"Laws of nature\":** This is a concept that has evolved. In ancient and medieval thought, it was understood less as rigid, inviolable mathematical laws and more as the \"ordinary course\" or \"nature\" of things as established by God. A \"change in the law\" would mean a change in this ordinary course.\n*   **Miracles (like the virgin birth):** Theologians have long debated whether a miracle is a violation of natural law or an event that operates according to a \"higher\" law or a hidden potential within nature itself.\n*   **The Fall:** The doctrine that the sin of Adam and Eve had cosmic consequences, introducing death, decay, and suffering into the world, implies a fundamental change in the way nature operates.\n\nBased on this, the most likely candidates are foundational figures who integrated philosophy with Christian doctrine, such as Augustine of Hippo or Thomas Aquinas.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Applicability of Augustine of Hippo**\n*   **Did he develop specialized terminology?** Yes. Augustine, particularly in his work *The Literal Meaning of Genesis* (*De Genesi ad litteram*), developed the concept of ***rationes seminales*** (Latin for \"seminal reasons\") or ***causales rationes*** (\"causal reasons\").\n*   **How does this terminology work?** Augustine proposed that God, in the initial act of creation, embedded all the latent potentials for everything that would ever come to exist into the fabric of the universe. These are the *rationes seminales*. The regular, predictable unfolding of these potentials is what we call the \"course of nature\" or \"natural law.\"\n*   **How does this apply to the Fall?** Augustine could argue that before the Fall, the negative potentials for death, disease, and decay were present as *rationes seminales* but were held in check. The Fall acted as a trigger, altering the state of creation and allowing these negative potentials to manifest, thus \"changing\" the operating principles of the natural world from one of incorruptibility to one of corruption.\n*   **How does this apply to the Virgin Birth?** The virgin birth is a miracle. According to Augustine's framework, this is not God creating something brand new from nothing after the sixth day, nor is it a chaotic violation of nature. Instead, God is directly activating a *rationale seminale* that He placed within creation (specifically within human nature) from the beginning. The potential for a human to be born without a human father was embedded in creation, and God actualized that potential at a specific moment in history. This explains the event as a change from the *ordinary* course of nature, but one that is consistent with God's original creative plan.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Other Candidates**\n*   **Thomas Aquinas:** Aquinas developed a sophisticated system of primary and secondary causality. God (the Primary Cause) normally works through created things (secondary causes) which operate according to their natures. A miracle is when God bypasses the secondary causes to produce an effect directly. While a powerful framework, Augustine's *rationes seminales* is more directly a \"specialized terminology\" designed to explain how novel things and systemic changes can emerge from *within* the created order itself, which perfectly matches the question's phrasing.\n*   **Other Early Fathers/Reformers:** While affirming the doctrines, they did not typically develop a specific, technical philosophical lexicon like *rationes seminales* to explain the mechanics of the change in natural operations in this way.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nAugustine of Hippo is the first major theologian to develop a specific, technical vocabulary—***rationes seminales***—that systematically explains how the \"laws of nature\" (the ordinary course of things) can be altered or superseded. This single framework is directly applicable to explaining both unique miracles like the virgin birth and systemic shifts in nature like the consequences of the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
