    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Aldehyde:** The first reactant is \"pivalaldehyde\". The pivaloyl group (or pivalyl) is another name for the tert-butylcarbonyl group. Therefore, pivalaldehyde is the aldehyde with a tert-butyl group, `(CH₃)₃C-`. Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`. The carbonyl carbon is attached to a bulky tert-butyl group and a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent:** The second reactant is \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\". This is the IUPAC name for a phosphorus ylide.\n        *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" refers to the `(C₆H₅)₃P=` group, also written as `Ph₃P=`.\n        *   \"ethylidene\" refers to a two-carbon unit originating from ethane, specifically `=CH-CH₃`. The double bond (in the ylide context) is from the phosphorus to the first carbon of the ethylidene group.\n        *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" indicates that a 2-chlorophenyl group (a benzene ring with a chlorine atom at the ortho position) is attached to the second carbon atom of the ethylidene group.\n        *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is `(C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`, where the chlorine is at the 2-position of the phenyl ring.\n\n2.  **Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or ketone) with a phosphorus ylide (the Wittig reagent).\n    *   The core transformation is the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom (`=O`) with the alkylidene group (`=CR¹R²`) from the ylide.\n    *   The reactants are: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=O` (pivalaldehyde) and `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)` (the ylide).\n    *   The products will be an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph₃P=O`).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of the Alkene Product:**\n    *   To form the new carbon-carbon double bond, we combine the carbon framework of the aldehyde (excluding the oxygen) with the carbon framework of the ylide (excluding the `Ph₃P` group).\n    *   Aldehyde part: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`\n    *   Ylide part: `=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)`\n    *   Connecting these two fragments gives the alkene structure: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product (IUPAC Nomenclature):**\n    *   First, identify the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. To do this, we expand the tert-butyl group:\n        ```\n              CH₃\n              |\n        (o-ClC₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=CH-C-CH₃\n                                |\n                               CH₃\n        ```\n    *   The longest chain is a five-carbon chain (a pentene).\n    *   Next, we number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant (position number).\n        *   Numbering from left to right: The double bond starts at carbon 2. (`(o-ClC₆H₄)-CH₂(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-...`)\n        *   Numbering from right to left: The double bond starts at carbon 3. (`...=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`)\n    *   Therefore, we must number from left to right. The parent chain is a **pent-2-ene**.\n    *   Identify the substituents on the parent chain:\n        *   At carbon 1: a **(2-chlorophenyl)** group.\n        *   At carbon 4: two **methyl** groups.\n    *   Assemble the full name: **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism):**\n    *   The product has a double bond with different substituents on each carbon, so E/Z isomers are possible.\n    *   Let's analyze the groups attached to each carbon of the double bond (`C2=C3`):\n        *   On C2: a hydrogen atom (`-H`) and a 2-chlorobenzyl group (`-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)`).\n        *   On C3: a hydrogen atom (`-H`) and a tert-butyl group (`-C(CH₃)₃`).\n    *   According to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules:\n        *   On C2, `-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)` has higher priority than `-H`.\n        *   On C3, `-C(CH₃)₃` has higher priority than `-H`.\n    *   The stereochemistry depends on the relative orientation of these two high-priority groups:\n        *   **Z-isomer (cis):** High-priority groups are on the *same* side of the double bond.\n        *   **E-isomer (trans):** High-priority groups are on *opposite* sides of the double bond.\n    *   The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the nature of the ylide. The ylide `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-R` is a non-stabilized (or simple) ylide. These typically favor the formation of the Z-alkene.\n    *   **Careful Point:** There is a significant exception. When one of the reactants is very sterically bulky, the reaction tends to favor the more thermodynamically stable E-isomer, where the large groups are far apart. Pivalaldehyde, with its massive tert-butyl group, is a classic example of such a sterically hindered reactant. The steric clash between the tert-butyl group and the 2-chlorobenzyl group in the Z-isomer would be very high. Therefore, the E-isomer is the expected major product.\n\n**Final Product:**\n\nThe major product of the reaction is the E-isomer.\n*   **Structure:** `(E)-(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)`\n*   **Name:** `(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`\n\n<<<(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
