    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept**\nThe question is about the binding of peptides to integrin receptors. Integrins are a major family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. A key feature of many integrin-ligand interactions is the recognition of a specific short amino acid sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Molecular Motif**\nAll the answer choices are peptides that begin with the sequence \"RGD\". RGD stands for the three amino acids: Arginine (R), Glycine (G), and Aspartic acid (D). The RGD sequence is the most famous and well-characterized recognition motif for a large number of integrins. It is found in many extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin, which are natural ligands for integrins.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Importance of Flanking Sequences**\nWhile the RGD sequence is essential for binding, the amino acids that surround it (the \"flanking sequences\") play a crucial role. These flanking residues influence the three-dimensional conformation of the peptide backbone. For high-affinity binding to occur, the RGD motif must be presented in a specific spatial orientation that fits into the binding pocket of the integrin receptor. Different integrins have different preferences for these flanking sequences, which contributes to binding specificity.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Each Peptide Option**\n\n*   **A. RGDMAA:** This peptide has Methionine (M) and two Alanines (A) following the RGD core. While any RGD peptide has some potential to bind, this specific sequence is not a well-known high-affinity motif from a major natural ligand.\n*   **B. RGDSPSS:** This peptide contains the sequence RGD**S**P. The sequence GRGD**SP** is famously derived from fibronectin, one of the most important ECM proteins and a primary ligand for integrins like α5β1 and αvβ3. The Proline (P) immediately following the serine is known to induce a specific type of bend in the peptide chain called a β-turn. This turn structure is critical because it optimally presents the R and D side chains for interaction with the integrin binding site. Synthetic peptides containing the RGDSP sequence are widely used in laboratories as competitive inhibitors to block cell adhesion in *in vitro* assays. Therefore, a peptide containing this motif is highly likely to bind to integrins.\n*   **C. RGDLTTP:** This sequence contains Leucine (L), Threonine (T), and Proline (P). While proline can induce turns, its position and the surrounding residues (L, T) do not correspond to the canonical high-affinity motif found in fibronectin or other major ligands.\n*   **D. RGDQVSK:** This peptide has a mixture of polar (Q, S, K) and nonpolar (V) residues. This sequence is not characteristic of known high-affinity integrin binding sites in major ECM proteins.\n*   **E. RGDARGG:** This sequence has Alanine (A), Arginine (R), and two Glycines (G) as flanking residues. The high flexibility imparted by the two glycine residues at the end might make it less likely to adopt the specific, constrained conformation required for high-affinity binding.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\nBased on the analysis, the peptide **RGDSPSS** contains the RGDSP motif, which is a classic and well-studied sequence from fibronectin. The proline in this sequence is known to confer a conformation that is highly favorable for binding to several types of integrin receptors. Peptides with this sequence are standard reagents used in cell biology to study and inhibit integrin function. Therefore, out of all the choices, RGDSPSS is the peptide that has been found to bind, or is most highly likely to bind, an integrin receptor in an *in vitro* assay.\n\n<<<B>>>"
