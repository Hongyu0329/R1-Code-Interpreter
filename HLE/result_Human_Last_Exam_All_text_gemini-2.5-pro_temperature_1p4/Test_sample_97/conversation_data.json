    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is placed in pure water, two main equilibrium reactions occur simultaneously that contribute to its dissolution:\n*   **Dissolution to form simple ions:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻). This is governed by the solubility product constant, $K_{sp}$.\n    *   Reaction 1:  Al(OH)₃(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    *   $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH⁻]^3 = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$\n*   **Formation of a complex ion:** The dissolved aluminum ions (Al³⁺) can react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) to form the soluble tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. This is governed by the formation constant, $K_f$.\n    *   Reaction 2:  Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    *   $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH⁻]^4} = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$\n*   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself contributes to the concentration of H⁺ and OH⁻.\n    *   Reaction 3: H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   $K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$\n\n**2. Define Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nThe molar solubility, S, of Al(OH)₃ is the total number of moles of aluminum that dissolve in one liter of solution. This is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n*   S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Set Up a System of Equations**\n\nTo solve for S, we must first find the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved. A robust method is to use the principle of charge neutrality.\n*   **Charge Balance Equation:** In any solution, the total positive charge concentration must equal the total negative charge concentration.\n    *   Positive ions: Al³⁺, H⁺\n    *   Negative ions: OH⁻, Al(OH)₄⁻\n    *   Charge Balance:  $3[Al^{3+}] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)_4⁻]$\n\n**4. Express Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable, [OH⁻]**\n\nWe can express the concentration of each species in the charge balance equation as a function of [OH⁻] using the equilibrium constants.\n*   From $K_{sp}$:  $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH⁻]^3}$\n*   From $K_w$:  $[H⁺] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH⁻]}$\n*   To find [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine the $K_{sp}$ and $K_f$ expressions:\n    *   $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f [Al^{3+}][OH⁻]^4 = K_f \\left(\\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH⁻]^3}\\right)[OH⁻]^4 = (K_f \\cdot K_{sp})[OH⁻]$\n    *   Let's calculate the product $K_f \\cdot K_{sp}$:\n        *   $K_f \\cdot K_{sp} = (1.1 \\times 10^{31})(5.3 \\times 10^{-27}) = 5.83 \\times 10^4$\n    *   So, $[Al(OH)_4^-] = (5.83 \\times 10^4)[OH⁻]$\n\n**5. Solve for [OH⁻]**\n\nNow substitute these expressions back into the charge balance equation:\n*   $3 \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH⁻]^3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{K_w}{[OH⁻]} \\right) = [OH⁻] + (K_f K_{sp})[OH⁻]$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for [OH⁻]:\n*   $\\frac{3K_{sp}}{[OH⁻]^3} + \\frac{K_w}{[OH⁻]} = [OH⁻](1 + K_f K_{sp})$\n*   Multiply the entire equation by $[OH⁻]^3$ to clear the denominators:\n    *   $3K_{sp} + K_w[OH⁻]^2 = (1 + K_f K_{sp})[OH⁻]^4$\n*   This is a quadratic equation in terms of $[OH⁻]^2$. Let $x = [OH⁻]^2$ and rearrange into the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n    *   $(1 + K_f K_{sp})x^2 - K_w x - 3K_{sp} = 0$\n*   Substitute the known values:\n    *   $a = (1 + 5.83 \\times 10^4) = 58301$\n    *   $b = -K_w = -1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$\n    *   $c = -3K_{sp} = -3(5.3 \\times 10^{-27}) = -1.59 \\times 10^{-26}$\n*   Solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n    *   $x = \\frac{-(-1.0 \\times 10^{-14}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1.0 \\times 10^{-14})^2 - 4(58301)(-1.59 \\times 10^{-26})}}{2(58301)}$\n    *   $x = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\pm \\sqrt{1.0 \\times 10^{-28} + 3.707 \\times 10^{-21}}}{116602}$\n    *   The $1.0 \\times 10^{-28}$ term is negligible. We take the positive root for a physical concentration.\n    *   $x \\approx \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14} + 6.089 \\times 10^{-11}}{116602} \\approx \\frac{6.089 \\times 10^{-11}}{116602} \\approx 5.222 \\times 10^{-16}$\n*   Since $x = [OH⁻]^2$:\n    *   $[OH⁻] = \\sqrt{5.222 \\times 10^{-16}} = 2.285 \\times 10^{-8}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n**6. Calculate the Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nFinally, use the calculated value of [OH⁻] to find the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species and sum them to get the solubility S.\n*   $S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4⁻]$\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH⁻]^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{(2.285 \\times 10^{-8})^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{1.196 \\times 10^{-23}} = 4.43 \\times 10^{-4}$ mol L⁻¹\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^-] = (K_f K_{sp})[OH⁻] = (5.83 \\times 10^4)(2.285 \\times 10^{-8}) = 1.33 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n*   $S = (4.43 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1.33 \\times 10^{-3}) = 0.000443 + 0.00133 = 0.001773$ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to an appropriate number of significant figures (e.g., three):\n*   $S = 1.77 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to recognize that both simple dissolution and complex ion formation contribute significantly to the solubility. Ignoring either one leads to an incorrect answer.\n*   The autoionization of water cannot be neglected, as the final pH is not neutral and [OH⁻] is not simply $10^{-7}$ M.\n*   Using a systematic approach based on fundamental principles like charge balance is the most reliable way to solve such a multi-equilibrium problem.\n*   Approximations, such as assuming one dissolved species is dominant, should be verified after the calculation. In this case, [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻] are of the same order of magnitude, so such an approximation would have been invalid.\n\n<<<1.77E-3>>>"
