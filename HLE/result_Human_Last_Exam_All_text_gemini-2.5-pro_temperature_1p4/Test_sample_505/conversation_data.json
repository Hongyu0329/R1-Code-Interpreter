    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Surface Code:** The surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. Qubits are arranged on a 2D surface. The key feature is that logical information is encoded non-locally in the topology of this surface.\n\n2.  **Encoding Logical Qubits in a Single Patch:** For a single, connected patch of a planar surface code, logical qubits are created by introducing topological defects, commonly referred to as \"holes\" or \"punctures.\"\n    *   A simple, rectangular patch with no holes cannot encode a protected logical qubit. It can store a specific logical state, but it lacks the necessary structure for arbitrary single-qubit operations.\n    *   To create a logical qubit, you need to introduce a hole. A hole allows for the creation of a pair of non-trivial logical operators (a logical X and a logical Z) that loop around the hole in different ways. These operators anti-commute with each other, forming the basis for a qubit, but commute with all the stabilizers of the code, meaning the encoded state is protected.\n    *   The number of logical qubits ($k$) that can be encoded in a single patch is equal to the number of holes ($h$) in it. The formula is:\n        $k = h$\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Given Configuration:** The problem specifies a system composed of:\n    *   **Two patches** of surface code.\n    *   Each patch has **two holes**.\n\n4.  **Calculating Logical Qubits for the First Patch:**\n    *   We take the first patch. It has $h_1 = 2$ holes.\n    *   Using the formula $k=h$, this patch can encode $k_1 = 2$ logical qubits.\n\n5.  **Calculating Logical Qubits for the Second Patch:**\n    *   We take the second patch. It also has $h_2 = 2$ holes.\n    *   Similarly, this patch can encode $k_2 = 2$ logical qubits.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Total Number of Logical Qubits:**\n    *   The problem describes two separate \"patches.\" This implies they are independent physical systems.\n    *   When quantum systems are independent, the total number of logical qubits they can store is the sum of the logical qubits each can store individually.\n    *   Total logical qubits ($K_{total}$) = (Logical qubits in Patch 1) + (Logical qubits in Patch 2)\n    *   $K_{total} = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Physical vs. Logical Qubits:** The question is about *logical* qubits (the protected information units), not the much larger number of *physical* qubits used to build the code.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Holes\":** A \"hole\" is a standard method for creating a logical qubit in a planar code. Each hole provides the necessary topology for one logical qubit.\n*   **Independence of Patches:** The term \"two patches\" implies two physically separate code instances. Unless a specific connection between them (like a logical bridge or wormhole) is mentioned, their capacities are additive. The problem does not suggest any such connection.\n*   **Formula:** The direct relationship $k=h$ (number of logical qubits = number of holes) is the fundamental principle for this type of surface code architecture.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, each of the two patches can encode two logical qubits, leading to a total of four logical qubits for the entire system.\n\n<<<4>>>"
