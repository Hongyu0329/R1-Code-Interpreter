    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Icosahedron**\n*   An icosahedron is a Platonic solid, which means it is a convex polyhedron with congruent regular polygonal faces and the same number of faces meeting at each vertex.\n*   Specifically, it has 20 faces, all of which are identical equilateral triangles.\n*   It has 30 edges and 12 vertices.\n*   A crucial property of the icosahedron (like all Platonic solids) is that it has a center of symmetry. This means that for any point on the surface of the icosahedron, there is a corresponding point directly opposite it through the center.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition**\n*   The tank is \"half-filled,\" meaning the volume of water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron tank.\n*   Due to the center of symmetry, any plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron will divide its volume into two equal halves.\n*   The surface of the water in a tank under gravity is always a horizontal plane.\n*   Combining these facts, we can conclude that when the icosahedron tank is half-filled, the water surface must be a horizontal plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Orientation of the Tank**\n*   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means that one of the 20 triangular faces is positioned horizontally to serve as the base.\n*   Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, the face on the very top of the tank will be parallel to the base face.\n*   The vertical axis, passing through the center of the base and the center of the top face, is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. This means that if you rotate the icosahedron by 120° (or 240°) around this vertical axis, it looks identical.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   We need to find the shape of the cross-section created by the horizontal plane passing through the icosahedron's center.\n*   **Symmetry Argument:**\n    1.  The intersecting plane is perpendicular to the 3-fold rotational axis. Therefore, the resulting shape of the water surface must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    2.  The intersecting plane passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry. Therefore, the resulting shape must also be centrally symmetric (meaning if you rotate it by 180°, it looks the same).\n    3.  A polygon that possesses both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must have at least 6 vertices and must have 6-fold rotational symmetry. A six-sided polygon with 6-fold symmetry is a regular hexagon.\n\n*   **Geometric Argument:**\n    1.  Consider the vertices of the icosahedron relative to the horizontal base. They are arranged in four distinct horizontal layers. The bottom and top layers each contain 3 vertices (forming the base and top triangles). The two middle layers each contain 3 vertices.\n    2.  The horizontal plane passing through the center lies exactly between these two middle layers of vertices.\n    3.  This plane will intersect all the edges that connect a vertex from the lower-middle layer to a vertex in the upper-middle layer.\n    4.  There are exactly 6 such edges forming a \"belt\" around the equator of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n    5.  Due to the overall symmetry, the plane cuts each of these 6 edges at its exact midpoint.\n    6.  These 6 intersection points form the vertices of the water surface. Because of the 3-fold and central symmetry, these 6 points must be arranged as the vertices of a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhen a half-filled icosahedron tank stands on one of its faces, the water surface forms a horizontal cross-section through the center of the icosahedron. The symmetries of the icosahedron in this orientation dictate that this cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
