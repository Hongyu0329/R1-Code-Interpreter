    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of several concepts from general topology, specifically continuum theory. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric\", so we must consider general Hausdorff spaces, not just metric spaces.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum of a continuum $X$ is a subset of $X$ that is also a continuum with the subspace topology. A *proper* subcontinuum is one that is not equal to the entire space $X$.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is said to be indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. That is, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua of $X$, then it must be that $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a given point $p$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $x \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $x$. It can be shown that the relation \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, and thus the distinct composants of a continuum form a partition of the space.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound for the Number of Composants\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest* number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have. Let's determine if this number can be 1.\n\nIf an indecomposable continuum $X$ had only one composant, that composant would have to be the entire space $X$. This would mean that for any two points $p, x \\in X$, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both $p$ and $x$.\n\nHowever, a fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that **every indecomposable continuum has more than one composant**.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The proof of this theorem is non-trivial. It generally involves showing that for any proper subcontinuum $A$, there exists at least one point $x \\in X$ whose composant is disjoint from $A$. This implies that the composant containing the points of $A$ cannot be the entire space, and since the composants partition the space, there must be at least one other composant.\n\nTherefore, the number of composants must be strictly greater than 1. The smallest possible integer value is 2. So, we have a lower bound: the number of composants must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 3: Determining if the Lower Bound of 2 is Achievable\n\nNow we must ask: does there exist an indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants?\n\nTo answer this, we should consider the distinction between metric and non-metric continua, as highlighted in the question.\n\n*   **In the Metric Case:** For indecomposable *metric* continua (like the pseudo-arc or solenoids), a famous theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that the number of composants is uncountable, and specifically has the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. This result relies on the Baire Category Theorem. In a compact metric space (which is a Baire space), each proper subcontinuum is a nowhere-dense closed set. A composant can be shown to be a meager set (a countable union of nowhere-dense sets). If there were only countably many composants, the entire space would be a countable union of meager sets, which is itself meager. This would contradict the Baire Category Theorem. Therefore, a metric indecomposable continuum cannot have 1, 2, or any finite or countably infinite number of composants.\n\n*   **In the Non-Metric Case:** The argument using the Baire Category Theorem fails for some non-metric spaces. Specifically, it relies on each composant being a *countable* union of proper subcontinua. This property holds in any space with a countable base for its topology (i.e., second-countable spaces), and compact second-countable Hausdorff spaces are metrizable. In a general compact Hausdorff space of uncountable weight, a composant may be an uncountable union of proper subcontinua, and thus not necessarily meager. This opens the door for a different result.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The \"not necessarily metric\" clause is the most crucial part of the question. It directs us away from the well-known result for metric spaces and towards more general topological constructions.\n\nIndeed, an example of an indecomposable continuum with a finite number of composants was constructed. In 1980, the mathematician David P. Bellamy published a paper titled \"An indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants\". He constructed a non-metric, compact, connected Hausdorff space which is indecomposable and is the union of exactly two of its composants.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  A fundamental theorem of continuum theory proves that any indecomposable continuum (metric or not) must have more than one composant. This establishes a lower bound of 2.\n2.  While metric indecomposable continua must have uncountably many composants, the same is not true for the general non-metric case.\n3.  The existence of an indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants was demonstrated by D. P. Bellamy.\n\nCombining these facts, the smallest possible number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
