    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_snp):** SNP heritability represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered together. It is a theoretical concept that represents the *upper limit* or the \"ceiling\" of predictability for a given phenotype using a linear model of all measured SNPs. It's a population parameter that we estimate using methods like GREML or LD Score Regression, which use genetic data from a large sample. Think of it as the variance you could explain if you knew the *true* effect size of every single SNP.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS):** A polygenic score is a practical tool built to predict a phenotype. It is calculated for an individual by summing their alleles across many genetic loci, weighted by effect sizes. These effect sizes are *not* the true, unknown effect sizes. Instead, they are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) \"discovery\" dataset.\n\n3.  **Identify the Source of Discrepancy:** The key difference lies in the nature of the SNP effect sizes used.\n    *   **SNP Heritability** conceptually corresponds to a model using the *true* effect sizes of all SNPs.\n    *   **A Polygenic Score** uses *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS with a finite sample size.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Impact of Estimation:** Because the GWAS discovery sample is finite, the estimated effect sizes will always have some degree of error compared to the true effect sizes. This error arises from:\n    *   **Sampling noise:** Random chance in a finite sample.\n    *   **Imperfect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) modeling:** The effect of a causal SNP might be incorrectly attributed to a nearby, correlated SNP that is measured on the genotyping array.\n    *   **Model limitations:** Most PGS methods use simplified models that may not perfectly capture the complex genetic architecture.\n\n5.  **Compare Predictive Ability:** The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how much variance it can explain (R²) when applied to a *new, independent* \"target\" dataset. Because the PGS is built with imperfect, noisy weights, it is an imperfect predictor. An imperfect predictor will not be able to capture the full amount of variance that is theoretically predictable.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The SNP heritability (h²_snp) sets the theoretical maximum predictive power achievable with a perfect linear SNP-based model. The polygenic score's predictive ability (R²_PGS) is the actual performance of a real-world, imperfect model. Due to the inherent estimation error in the weights used to build the PGS, its predictive performance will necessarily be lower than the theoretical maximum. The gap between R²_PGS and h²_snp can be reduced by using larger GWAS discovery samples (which yield more precise effect size estimates), but for any finite sample size, the R²_PGS will remain below h²_snp.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ceiling vs. Reality:** SNP heritability is the ceiling; PGS predictive power is the reality. Reality rarely reaches the theoretical ceiling.\n*   **Source of Weights:** The critical point is that PGS weights are *estimated* from data, and these estimates contain error. This error degrades predictive performance.\n*   **\"Necessarily\":** The term \"necessarily\" is strong but correct in this context. A model built with estimated parameters (the PGS) from a finite sample cannot, except by sheer chance in a specific small test set, outperform the theoretical maximum performance of a model with the true parameters (represented by SNP heritability). In terms of expected performance, it is always lower.\n*   **Out-of-Sample Prediction:** The measure of a PGS's ability is its performance in a new sample, which penalizes overfitting. SNP heritability is a property of the population itself.\n\nTherefore, the statement is correct.\n\n<<<True>>>"
