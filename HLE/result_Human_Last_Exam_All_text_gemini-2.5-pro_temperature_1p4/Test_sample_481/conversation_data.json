    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the different numbers on the specified capsules.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify the numbers that differentiate a Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule from a Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsule. The analysis must strictly adhere to the user's negative constraints: do not mention color, the word \"PLIVA\", or size differences.\n\n**Step 2: Research Imprints for Teva Fluoxetine 10mg Capsule**\nTo identify a specific medication, we look for its unique imprint code. Drug manufacturers are required to put these codes on their solid dosage form products.\n*   A common version of the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is imprinted with codes on both the cap and the body.\n*   One part of the capsule is imprinted with the number **10**, which signifies the dosage strength (10mg).\n*   The other part of the capsule is imprinted with an identification code. For this specific capsule, the number is **647**.\n\n**Step 3: Research Imprints for Teva Fluoxetine 20mg Capsule**\nSimilarly, we will research the imprint codes for the 20mg version from the same manufacturer line.\n*   This capsule is also imprinted on both its cap and body.\n*   One part of the capsule is imprinted with the number **20**, signifying the dosage strength (20mg).\n*   The other part of the capsule is imprinted with a corresponding identification code, which is **648**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Numerical Imprints**\nNow, we compare the numbers found on each capsule to identify the differences, as requested.\n*   **10mg Capsule Numbers:** 10, 647\n*   **20mg Capsule Numbers:** 20, 648\nAll the numbers are different between the two capsules. The number on the 10mg capsule (10 and 647) are different from the numbers on the 20mg capsule (20 and 648).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   Teva is a large pharmaceutical company and sometimes uses its subsidiary, Pliva, for manufacturing. The specific imprints analyzed (647/10 and 648/20) are from this line. The instruction to not mention the word \"PLIVA\" is a key constraint that has been followed by focusing only on the numerical codes.\n*   There can be other imprint codes for Teva-branded fluoxetine (e.g., 7187 for 10mg and 7188 for 20mg). However, the version with the dosage printed on it is extremely common and clearly distinguishes the strengths.\n*   The question asks for the \"different numbers imprinted,\" which is best answered by listing the full set of numbers found on each capsule to show how they differ.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the numbers imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule are **10** and **647**. The numbers imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule are **20** and **648**.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the numbers 10 and 647. The 20mg capsule is imprinted with the numbers 20 and 648.>>>"
