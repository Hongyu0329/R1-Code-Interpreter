    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and find the differences between consecutive terms.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's find the difference between each term and the one before it (the first-order difference):\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe sequence of differences is: 9, 12, 28, 68. This sequence does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a multiplicative relationship.**\nLet's test if there is a pattern of the form: `Next Term = k * Current Term + Constant`. Since the terms are roughly doubling, let's try k=2.\n*   From 2 to 11: 2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n*   From 11 to 23: 11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n*   From 23 to 51: 23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n*   From 51 to 119: 51 * 2 + 17 = 119\nThis reveals a consistent primary rule: `A_{n+1} = 2 * A_n + C_n`, where `A_n` is the n-th term and `C_n` is a sequence of added numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sequence of added numbers `C_n`.**\nThe sequence `C_n` is: 7, 1, 5, 17, ...\nAt first glance, this sequence looks random. However, a common feature in these problems is that the main pattern might ignore the very first term. Let's analyze the sequence `C_n` starting from its second term.\nThe sub-sequence is: 1, 5, 17, ...\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern within the sub-sequence of added numbers.**\nLet's analyze the sequence `1, 5, 17`.\n*   Difference: 5 - 1 = 4; 17 - 5 = 12. The differences (4, 12) are not constant.\n*   Ratio: 5 / 1 = 5; 17 / 5 = 3.4. The ratios are not constant.\n*   Let's check for a recursive pattern of the form `C_{k+1} = a * C_k + b`.\n    *   For the second term: `5 = a * 1 + b`\n    *   For the third term: `17 = a * 5 + b`\n    *   Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: `12 = 4a`, which means `a = 3`.\n    *   Substituting `a = 3` back into the first equation: `5 = 3 * 1 + b`, which means `b = 2`.\nSo, the pattern for the added numbers (starting from the second one) is: `C_{k+1} = 3 * C_k + 2`.\nLet's verify this:\n*   To get 5 from 1: `3 * 1 + 2 = 5`. Correct.\n*   To get 17 from 5: `3 * 5 + 2 = 17`. Correct.\n\n**Step 5: Use the discovered patterns to find the next term in the main sequence.**\n1.  First, we need to find the next term in the sequence of added numbers `C_n`. The last calculated term was 17. The next one will be:\n    `3 * 17 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53`.\n2.  Now, we use this new added number to find the next term in the original sequence `A_n`. The last term was 119.\n    `Next Term = 2 * 119 + 53`\n    `Next Term = 238 + 53`\n    `Next Term = 291`\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n**Summary of the pattern:**\n*   `A_1 = 2`\n*   `A_2 = 11` (This is calculated as `2 * A_1 + 7`)\n*   Then for n â‰¥ 2, the rule is `A_{n+1} = 2 * A_n + C_n` where the sequence `C_n` starts with `C_2 = 1` and follows the rule `C_{k+1} = 3 * C_k + 2`.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   A3 = 2*A2 + C2 = 2*11 + 1 = 23. (Correct)\n*   A4 = 2*A3 + C3 = 2*23 + (3*1+2) = 46 + 5 = 51. (Correct)\n*   A5 = 2*A4 + C4 = 2*51 + (3*5+2) = 102 + 17 = 119. (Correct)\n*   A6 = 2*A5 + C5 = 2*119 + (3*17+2) = 238 + 53 = 291.\n\nThe final answer is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
