Chemical Ligation. This method involves breaking the 100-amino-acid peptide into smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., 2-3 fragments of 30-50aa each). Each fragment is synthesized individually using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), which allows for the easy and precise incorporation of the unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, into the correct fragment. The purified fragments are then chemically joined together (ligated) in solution to form the final, full-length 100aa peptide. This approach overcomes the significant yield and purity problems associated with synthesizing a long peptide in a single SPPS run.
