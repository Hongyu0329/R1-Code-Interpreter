No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of this mimicry is to provide a recognizable warning signal to the species' natural predators, which are primarily birds. The validity of the research method hinges on whether the chosen "raters" (untrained undergraduates) are a suitable proxy for these predators. They are not, for two main reasons:
1.  **Different Visual Systems:** Human vision is trichromatic, while avian vision is tetrachromatic. Birds can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Bumblebee color patterns often include UV reflectance that is a critical part of their signal to predators. By using humans, the study ignores an entire dimension of the visual signal, potentially leading to incorrect groupings. Two species that look identical to a human may appear distinct to a bird, and thus would not be functional mimics.
2.  **Lack of Ecological Context:** Predators learn to avoid these patterns through negative reinforcement (e.g., getting stung). This learning process shapes what features of the signal are most salient. Untrained undergraduates have no such experience; their judgment of "similarity" is subjective and may not align with the specific visual cues a predator uses to recognize and avoid prey.

Therefore, because the method fails to model the perception of the relevant selective agent (the predator), the resulting clusters would not reliably reflect the mimicry syndromes as they function ecologically.
