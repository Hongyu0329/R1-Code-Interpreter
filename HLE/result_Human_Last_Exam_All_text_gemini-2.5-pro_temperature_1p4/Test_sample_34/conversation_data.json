    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Scenario**\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game.\n    *   **100BB:** This is a standard stack depth, meaning typical pre-flop strategies apply.\n    *   **Rake-Free:** This is a critical detail. No rake means the reward for stealing the blinds (1.5BB) is higher relative to the risk (2.5BB) than in a raked game. This incentivizes opening a wider range of hands, as every pot won, pre-flop or post-flop, is larger.\n    *   **Cash Game:** No tournament considerations like ICM. The goal is to maximize Expected Value (EV) on every hand.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN).\n    *   This is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last post-flop.\n    *   Positional advantage allows you to realize your equity more effectively and open the widest range of any position at the table.\n*   **Action:** Open to 2.5x.\n    *   A standard opening size that balances risk and reward.\n*   **Question:** \"What is the worst suited jack you should open?\"\n    *   This asks for the hand at the very bottom of the opening range that fits the \"suited jack\" category (JXs). We are looking for the weakest JXs hand that is still a profitable open-raise.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Impact of Position and Rake-Free Environment**\n\nThe combination of being on the button (best position) and in a rake-free game (higher rewards) means we should be opening an extremely wide range of hands. A typical GTO (Game Theory Optimal) button opening range in a standard *raked* game is already around 45-50%. In a rake-free game, this range expands even further because the immediate profitability of stealing the blinds increases.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Suited Jack (JXs) Hands**\n\nWe need to consider all possible suited jack combinations and rank them in terms of strength and playability. The potential hands are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n\n*   **Premium JXs (JTs, J9s):** These are very strong hands. They make top pairs with good kickers, and have excellent straight and flush potential. They are clear opens from any position, let alone the button.\n*   **Mid-Strength JXs (J8s, J7s):** These hands are still very strong. They retain good flush potential and have decent connectivity for making straights. They are standard opens from the button.\n*   **Weak JXs (J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s):** The value of these hands comes primarily from three sources:\n    1.  **Fold Equity:** Forcing the blinds to fold and winning the 1.5BB uncontested.\n    2.  **Flush Potential:** A Jack-high flush is a very strong hand.\n    3.  **Top Pair Potential:** Hitting a pair of Jacks. The low kicker is a weakness, but being in position helps mitigate this risk.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Cut-off Point**\n\nGiven the highly favorable conditions (BTN position, rake-free), we are incentivized to play all hands that have a positive expected value. GTO solvers show that even in standard raked games, the button's opening range includes *all* suited jacks. This is because their combination of fold equity, flush potential, and playability in position makes them profitable opens.\n\nSince J2s is a standard open in a raked game, it is an even more profitable open in a rake-free game.\n\nThe question is to identify the \"worst\" one that we *should* open. If we should open all of them from JTs down to J2s, the worst one is simply the weakest hand in that group.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Weakest Suited Jacks**\n\n*   **J3s vs. J2s:** Both have a big gap, hurting straight potential.\n*   **J4s vs. J3s:** J4s has slightly better connectivity.\n*   **J5s vs. J4s:** J5s connects with lower cards (A, 2, 3, 4) to make a wheel straight, giving it slightly more playability than the hands below it.\n\nComparing all suited jacks, the strength and playability decrease as the second card gets lower.\nJTs > J9s > J8s > ... > J3s > J2s.\nTherefore, the hand with the lowest equity and worst connectivity within the entire suited jack category is **J2s**.\n\nSince all suited jacks are considered standard opens from the button in this scenario, the worst one you should open is the one at the very bottom of that list.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn a 100BB rake-free cash game, you should open all suited jacks from the button due to the immense positional advantage and increased pot odds for stealing the blinds. The worst hand within this category, and therefore the correct answer, is the one with the lowest kicker and poorest connectivity.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
