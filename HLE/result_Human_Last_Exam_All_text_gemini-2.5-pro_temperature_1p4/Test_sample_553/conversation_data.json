    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\n*   **\"Song by The Beatles\"**: The search is limited to the discography of The Beatles.\n*   **\"Starts with\"**: The chord progression in question must be the very first musical event in the song, defining its introduction.\n*   **\"Tonic\"**: This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key. It is the first degree of the scale, often denoted as the 'I' chord in a major key or the 'i' chord in a minor key.\n*   **\"Minor fifth chord\"**: This is the crucial part.\n    *   The \"fifth\" refers to the fifth degree of the musical scale. For example, in the key of C, the fifth note is G.\n    *   Normally, the chord built on the fifth degree in a major key is a *major* chord (called the dominant or 'V' chord). In the key of C, this would be a G major chord.\n    *   A \"minor fifth chord\" means the chord built on the fifth degree is a *minor* chord (a 'v' chord). In the key of C, this would be a G minor chord.\n    *   This progression (tonic to minor fifth) can occur in two main ways:\n        1.  **In a minor key**: In a natural minor scale, the chord built on the fifth degree is naturally minor. For example, in A minor, the tonic is A minor ('i'), and the minor fifth chord is E minor ('v').\n        2.  **In a major key**: This is less common but very effective. It involves \"borrowing\" the minor 'v' chord from the parallel minor key. For example, a song in C major (I) would use a G minor (v) instead of the expected G major (V).\n\n**2. Evaluating Potential Candidates**\n\nWe need to think of Beatles songs and analyze their opening chord progressions.\n\n*   **\"Let It Be\"**: Starts C - G - Am - F. This is I - V - vi - IV in the key of C. The fifth chord (G) is major, not minor.\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: This song is famous for its sophisticated chords. The introductory verse (\"Michelle, ma belle...\") is in F minor. The progression is roughly Fm - Bbm (i - iv). It does not start with a tonic-to-minor-fifth jump.\n*   **\"I'll Be Back\"**: The main verse uses the progression A -> Em. If we consider the key A major, this is a I -> v progression. However, the song *starts* with a different acoustic intro (Am - G - C...) and doesn't begin with this specific jump.\n*   **\"Girl\"**: Starts in C minor. The progression is Cm -> G. This is i -> V. The fifth chord (G) is major, used to create a strong resolution back to the tonic. This is not a minor fifth.\n\n**3. Identifying the Correct Song**\n\nThe song that fits the description perfectly is **\"Because\"** from the 1969 album *Abbey Road*.\n\n*   **Key**: The song is in the key of C-sharp minor (C#m).\n*   **Tonic Chord**: The tonic ('i') chord is C# minor.\n*   **Fifth Degree**: The fifth note of the C# minor scale is G-sharp (G#).\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord**: The chord built on the fifth degree of the natural minor scale is a minor chord. Therefore, the minor fifth ('v') chord is G-sharp minor (G#m).\n*   **The Introduction**: The song begins with a distinct arpeggiated figure played on an electric harpsichord.\n    *   The very first chord played is a **C# minor** arpeggio (the tonic).\n    *   This is immediately followed by a **G# minor** arpeggio (the minor fifth chord).\n\nThis opening progression, i -> v (C#m -> G#m), is a direct and clear jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord, making it the defining feature of the song's start.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Key Ambiguity**: The question doesn't specify whether the key is major or minor. The answer lies in a song in a minor key where the minor fifth chord is a natural part of the scale.\n2.  **Musical Terminology**: A precise understanding of \"tonic\" and \"minor fifth chord\" is essential. The \"minor fifth\" refers to a minor chord built on the fifth degree, not a chord containing a diminished fifth.\n3.  **\"Starts with\"**: This is a strict condition. The progression must be the intro, not just a part of the verse or chorus. \"Because\" fulfills this condition perfectly as it's the very first sound you hear.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Because\". The song is in the key of C-sharp minor, and its iconic introduction consists of an arpeggiated C-sharp minor chord (the tonic, 'i') immediately followed by an arpeggiated G-sharp minor chord (the minor fifth, 'v').\n\n<<<Because>>>"
