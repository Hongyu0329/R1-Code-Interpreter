    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem statement and verify the Calabi-Yau condition\n\nThe problem provides a polynomial and a set of weights for the ambient space $\\mathbb{C}^5$:\n*   Polynomial: $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$\n*   Weights: $w = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$\n\nA \"Calabi-Yau Link\" refers to the link of a singularity defined by a weighted homogeneous polynomial $P$ where the degree $d$ equals the sum of the weights, i.e., $d = \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i$. This is the Gorenstein or Calabi-Yau condition.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of the weights:\n$\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\nSo, the expected degree of the polynomial is $d=225$.\n\nNext, let's check the weighted degree of each monomial in the given polynomial $P$:\n*   $z_1^8z_3$: $8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8 \\cdot 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n*   $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$: $4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n*   $z_1z_2^7$: $1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n*   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $1 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 + 1 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $z_2z_3^4$: $1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4 \\cdot 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n*   $z_4^3z_5$: $3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $z_5^3$: $3 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 75 = 225$.\n\nThe polynomial is not weighted homogeneous, as the second term has degree 224 while the others have degree 225. Given the context, this is almost certainly a typo in the problem statement. To satisfy the Calabi-Yau condition ($d=\\sum w_i=225$), we must correct the polynomial. The most plausible correction to the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ to increase its degree by 1 is to replace one variable with another of the appropriate weight. Replacing $z_3$ (weight 49) with $z_4$ (weight 50) changes the degree from 224 to $224 - 49 + 50 = 225$.\n\n**Corrected Polynomial:** $P_{corr} = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_4+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$.\nWe will proceed with this corrected polynomial, which is weighted homogeneous of degree $d=225$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Milnor Number ($\\mu$) and Signature ($\\sigma$) of the Singularity\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is related to topological invariants of the singularity's link, specifically the Milnor number $\\mu$ and the signature of the Milnor fiber $\\sigma$. These can be calculated from the weights and degree, assuming an isolated singularity.\n\n**Milnor Number ($\\mu$):**\nFor an isolated weighted homogeneous singularity, the Milnor number is given by the formula:\n$\\mu = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{d-w_i}{w_i}$\n$\\mu = \\left(\\frac{225-22}{22}\\right) \\left(\\frac{225-29}{29}\\right) \\left(\\frac{225-49}{49}\\right) \\left(\\frac{225-50}{50}\\right) \\left(\\frac{225-75}{75}\\right)$\n$\\mu = \\left(\\frac{203}{22}\\right) \\left(\\frac{196}{29}\\right) \\left(\\frac{176}{49}\\right) \\left(\\frac{175}{50}\\right) \\left(\\frac{150}{75}\\right)$\n$\\mu = \\left(\\frac{7 \\cdot 29}{22}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4 \\cdot 49}{29}\\right) \\left(\\frac{8 \\cdot 22}{49}\\right) \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) (2)$\nAfter canceling terms:\n$\\mu = 7 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot 2 = 7 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = 1568$.\nA finite Milnor number confirms the singularity is isolated.\n\n**Signature ($\\sigma$):**\nThe link is not a rational homology sphere because $\\text{gcd}(w_4, d) = \\text{gcd}(50, 225) = 25 \\ne 1$ and $\\text{gcd}(w_5, d) = \\text{gcd}(75, 225) = 75 \\ne 1$. Therefore, the simple formula for the signature is not applicable. We must use a more general formula that sums over roots of unity:\n$\\sigma = \\sum_{\\omega} \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1-\\omega^{-w_i}}{1-\\omega^{w_i}}$, where the sum is over all $\\omega$ such that $\\omega^d=1$, $\\omega \\ne 1$, and $\\omega^{w_i} \\ne 1$ for all $i$.\n\nThe term inside the sum simplifies: $\\frac{1-\\omega^{-a}}{1-\\omega^a} = -\\omega^{-a}$.\nThe product becomes: $\\prod_{i=1}^5 (-\\omega^{-w_i}) = (-1)^5 \\omega^{-\\sum w_i} = -\\omega^{-d}$.\nSince $\\omega^d=1$, we have $\\omega^{-d}=1$. So each term in the sum is simply $-1$.\n\nNow we must find the number of terms in the sum. We need to sum over $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 224\\}$ such that $\\omega_k = e^{2\\pi i k/d}$ satisfies $\\omega_k^{w_i} \\ne 1$ for all $i$. This condition is equivalent to $d$ not dividing $k \\cdot w_i$, which means $k$ cannot be a multiple of $d/\\text{gcd}(d, w_i)$.\n*   $d/\\text{gcd}(225, 22) = 225/1 = 225$.\n*   $d/\\text{gcd}(225, 29) = 225/1 = 225$.\n*   $d/\\text{gcd}(225, 49) = 225/1 = 225$.\n*   $d/\\text{gcd}(225, 50) = 225/25 = 9$.\n*   $d/\\text{gcd}(225, 75) = 225/75 = 3$.\n\nWe must exclude $k \\in \\{1, ..., 224\\}$ that are multiples of 225, 9, or 3. The union of these conditions is simply that $k$ must not be a multiple of 3.\nNumber of integers from 1 to 224: 224.\nNumber of multiples of 3 up to 224: $\\lfloor 224/3 \\rfloor = 74$.\nNumber of terms in the sum = $224 - 74 = 150$.\nThe signature is the sum of these 150 terms, each equal to -1:\n$\\sigma = 150 \\times (-1) = -150$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström Invariant (S)\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant (also known as the s-invariant or $\\lambda$-invariant in some literature) for the link of a weighted homogeneous singularity is given by the formula:\n$S = -\\frac{\\mu + \\sigma}{2} \\pmod{24}$\n\nUsing our calculated values for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$:\n*   $\\mu = 1568$\n*   $\\sigma = -150$\n\n$S = -\\frac{1568 + (-150)}{2} \\pmod{24}$\n$S = -\\frac{1418}{2} \\pmod{24}$\n$S = -709 \\pmod{24}$\n\nTo find the value modulo 24, we perform the division:\n$709 = 29 \\times 24 + 13$.\nSo, $709 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{24}$.\nTherefore, $-709 \\equiv -13 \\pmod{24}$.\n$-13 \\equiv -13 + 24 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{24}$.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is 11."
