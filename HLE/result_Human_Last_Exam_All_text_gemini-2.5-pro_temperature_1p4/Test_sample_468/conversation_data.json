    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** The bee genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\".\n*   **Task 1:** Identify the currently used common name for this genus within its native range.\n*   **Task 2:** Determine the year this common name was coined or formally established.\n*   **Format:** The final answer must be presented as \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the native range of the genus *Perdita*.**\n*   The genus *Perdita* is a very large group of small, solitary bees.\n*   Research indicates their native range is exclusively in North and Central America.\n*   They are most diverse and abundant in the arid and desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Therefore, the common name we are looking for is the one used in North America.\n\n**Step 3: Find the currently used common name.**\n*   A search of entomological resources, including field guides, university extension websites, and conservation organizations (like the Xerces Society), reveals a consistent common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n*   Due to their extremely small size (some species are among the world's smallest bees) and often iridescent colors, they are commonly referred to as \"Fairy Bees\".\n*   While other descriptive names like \"sand bees\" or \"dwarf bees\" might occasionally be used, \"Fairy Bees\" is the most specific, widely adopted, and currently used common name for the genus as a whole.\n\n**Step 4: Determine when the common name was coined.**\n*   This is the most challenging part, as common names can evolve informally over time. The goal is to find the date of the publication that formally proposed or popularized the name, leading to its current widespread use.\n*   Technical taxonomic works from the 20th century, such as those by P.H. Timberlake (the foremost expert on *Perdita*) or Charles D. Michener (\"The Bees of the World\"), do not typically use or establish English common names.\n*   The push to assign common names to North American bee genera for a broader audience is a more recent phenomenon.\n*   The highly influential 2015 book, \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" by Joseph S. Wilson and Olivia Messinger Carril, was a landmark publication in this effort.\n*   In the book's introduction, the authors state, \"When a common name for a genus did not exist, we have proposed one...\" They then prominently feature the genus *Perdita* under the common name \"Fairy Bees.\"\n*   While the term may have appeared sporadically before, this 2015 publication is credited with formally proposing and cementing \"Fairy Bees\" as the standard common name for the genus, leading to its current common usage. Therefore, 2015 is the most accurate and verifiable year for when the name was \"coined\" in a formal, published sense.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer in the required format.**\n*   **Name:** Fairy Bees\n*   **Year:** 2015\n*   **Formatted Answer:** Fairy Bees, 2015\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 2015>>>"
