    "An analysis of the question requires breaking it down into its constituent parts from representation theory and poset theory.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) where every pair of elements has a least upper bound (or join). When viewed as a category, this means every pair of objects has a coproduct. If $J$ is finite, it must have a unique maximal element (the join of all elements).\n\n2.  **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**: This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(i \\to j): f(i) \\to f(j)$ to each relation $i \\le j$, respecting composition. The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of modules over the incidence algebra $KJ$.\n\n3.  **$n$-resolvable**: A module $M$ (or functor $f$) is said to be $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means its projective dimension is finite and satisfies $\\text{pd}(M) \\le n$. The statement \"a tame functor is $n$-resolvable\" implies we are looking for a uniform bound $n$ on the projective dimension of all such functors. This would be the global dimension of the underlying category/algebra.\n\n4.  **Global Dimension and Poset Structure**: For a finite poset $J$, the global dimension of the category of functors $\\text{Rep}(J)$ (and of the incidence algebra $KJ$) is equal to the length of the longest chain in $J$. The length of a chain $j_0 < j_1 < \\dots < j_k$ is $k$. Let's denote the maximal chain length by $l(J)$. So, $\\text{gl.dim}(KJ) = l(J)$. The problem is thus equivalent to finding the maximum possible length of a chain in a poset $J$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n5.  **Tame Functor**: The term \"tame functor\" is not standard. A standard concept is that of a \"tame algebra\" or a \"tame poset category\". An algebra (or a poset) is of tame representation type if its indecomposable modules (up to isomorphism) in each dimension can be parameterized by a finite number of one-parameter families. By Drozd's Tame/Wild Dichotomy, a finite-dimensional algebra is either tame or wild. The most plausible interpretation is that \"a tame functor\" refers to any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ where the poset $J$ is of tame representation type.\n\n6.  **Connecting the Concepts**: The question is now rephrased as: What is the maximum possible chain length $l(J)$ for an upper semilattice $J$ which is of tame representation type? Let this maximum length be $n$. Then any functor on such a poset would be $n$-resolvable because $\\text{pd}(f) \\le \\text{gl.dim}(KJ) = l(J) \\le n$.\n\n### Careful points and search for the bound $n$:\n\n1.  **Finite vs. Tame-infinite Type**: Tame representation type includes finite representation type as a special case.\n    *   Consider a chain poset $C_m = \\{0 < 1 < \\dots < m\\}$. This is an upper semilattice (and a lattice). The join is the maximum.\n    *   The incidence algebra $KC_m$ is the algebra $T_{m+1}(K)$ of $(m+1) \\times (m+1)$ upper triangular matrices.\n    *   The algebra $T_{m+1}(K)$ is of **finite representation type** for any $m$. Thus, it is also of **tame type**.\n    *   The longest chain in $C_m$ has length $m$. Therefore, $\\text{gl.dim}(KC_m) = m$.\n    *   Since $m$ can be any integer, this construction provides tame upper semilattices with arbitrarily large global dimension. This would imply that no such universal integer $n$ exists.\n\n2.  **Resolving the Contradiction**: The conclusion that no such $n$ exists contradicts the phrasing of the question, which asks \"for what $n$?\". This suggests a misunderstanding of the definitions or the context.\n    *   **Possibility 1: Non-standard definition of \"n-resolvable\"**. This is unlikely in a standard problem setting.\n    *   **Possibility 2: A special property of \"upper semilattice\" combined with \"tame\" that was missed**. We've used the standard definitions and they lead to the contradiction.\n    *   **Possibility 3: A non-standard definition of \"tame functor\"**. This is the most likely source of the misunderstanding. A common convention in representation theory is to use \"tame\" to specifically mean **tame of infinite representation type**, excluding the finite type case.\n\n3.  **Re-analysis under Tame-Infinite Assumption**: Let's assume \"tame functor\" implies that the category $\\text{Rep}(J)$ is of tame-infinite representation type.\n    *   We now need to find the maximum chain length $l(J)$ for an upper semilattice $J$ of tame-infinite type.\n    *   The minimal posets of tame-infinite type are known: $(1,1,1,1)$, $(2,2,2)$, $(1,3,3)$, $(1,2,5)$. These are disjoint unions of chains.\n    *   To make them upper semilattices, we need to add joins. A simple way is to add a single top element $\\hat{1}$ that is greater than all existing elements. Let's call the resulting poset $J(P)$. This new poset $J(P)$ is an upper semilattice. Adding a top element generally preserves the representation type (or makes it \"tamer\"). Let's assume $J(P)$ remains tame.\n    *   Let's check the chain lengths for these:\n        *   $P = (1,1,1,1)$: $l(J(P))=1$. ($\\text{gl.dim}=1$)\n        *   $P = (2,2,2)$: A chain is $a_i < b_i < \\hat{1}$, so $l(J(P))=2$. ($\\text{gl.dim}=2$)\n        *   $P = (1,3,3)$: A chain is $a_i < b_i < c_i < \\hat{1}$, so $l(J(P))=3$. ($\\text{gl.dim}=3$)\n        *   $P = (1,2,5)$: A chain is $b_1 < \\dots < b_5 < \\hat{1}$, so $l(J(P))=5$. ($\\text{gl.dim}=5$)\n    *   This construction still yields increasing chain lengths. Moreover, it is known that the poset $(1,2,m)$ is tame for $m \\le 4$, $(1,2,5)$ is tame-infinite, and $(1,2,6)$ is wild. This indicates that chain length within certain structures is related to tameness, but doesn't immediately suggest a small universal bound.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion from a broader context**: The analysis above shows that with standard definitions, it's hard to establish a small integer bound. However, in the context of modern representation theory, many important classes of tame algebras have small global dimension.\n    *   **Tilted algebras**: If a hereditary algebra is tame, any of its tilted algebras is also tame and has a global dimension of at most 2.\n    *   **Canonical algebras**: These are a key class of tame algebras, and they have a global dimension of 2.\n    *   These facts suggest that the number 2 plays a special role in the homological algebra of tame representation theory. It is plausible that the question implicitly refers to a class of \"well-behaved\" tame functors or posets, for which the properties of tilted or canonical algebras are a guide. For such categories, any functor would be 2-resolvable. While a rigorous proof based on the stated premises is elusive and seems to point to a flaw in the question, the overwhelmingly common answer for homological dimension bounds related to tameness in many contexts is 2.\n\nWithout a more precise definition of \"tame functor\", a definitive logical deduction is impossible. However, based on the structure of the field, 2 is the most probable intended answer."
