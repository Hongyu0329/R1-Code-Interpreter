    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z$ in the equation $e^Z = e^X e^Y$, where X and Y are non-commuting variables (like matrices). The formula for Z is a series composed of nested commutators of X and Y:\n\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nHere, $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ consisting of linear combinations of nested commutators involving $n$ total instances of X and Y. For example:\n*   $Z_1 = X + Y$\n*   $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n*   $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [X, Y]]$\n\nThe \"order\" of a term corresponds to its degree, which is the total count of X's and Y's in it. We are asked to find the number of non-zero coefficients for the terms of order 10.\n\n**2. Relate the Problem to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe terms $Z_n(X, Y)$ are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, X and Y, which we can denote as $L(X, Y)$. The set of all homogeneous Lie polynomials of a specific degree $n$ forms a vector subspace of $L(X, Y)$, denoted as $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\nIt is a known property of the BCH formula that its terms span this entire subspace. In other words, when $Z_n(X,Y)$ is expressed in a standard basis for $L_n(X,Y)$ (such as a Hall basis or Lyndon basis), all the coefficients are non-zero. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients of order $n$ is equal to the dimension of the vector space $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\n**3. Use Witt's Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the n-th graded component of a free Lie algebra with $k$ generators is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n\n$\\dim(L_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $n$ is the degree (or order) of the terms.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**4. Apply the Formula to the Specific Problem**\n\nFor our question:\n*   The order is $n=10$.\n*   The generators are X and Y, so $k=2$.\n\nWe need to calculate $\\dim(L_{10}(X, Y)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$.\n\n**Careful Points and Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 4a: Identify the divisors of n=10.**\n    The positive divisors of 10 are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor.**\n    The Möbius function is defined as:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = (-1)^r$ if $d$ is a product of $r$ distinct prime numbers.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\n\n    For our divisors:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = (-1)^1 = -1$ (since 2 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = (-1)^1 = -1$ (since 5 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\times 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate each term in the summation $\\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$.**\n    *   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n    *   For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = -1 \\cdot 2^5 = -32$\n    *   For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = -1 \\cdot 2^2 = -4$\n    *   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 2$\n\n*   **Step 4d: Compute the sum.**\n    Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$.\n\n*   **Step 4e: Divide by n to get the final dimension.**\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(X, Y)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables. Based on the calculation using Witt's formula, this number is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
