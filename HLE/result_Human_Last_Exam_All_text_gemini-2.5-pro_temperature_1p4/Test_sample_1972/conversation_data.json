    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific novel identified by two key pieces of information from Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   A direct quote: The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   A description of the author: He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **The Quote:** The phrase \"intensity of a tiger\" suggests raw power, ferocity, and visceral emotion. The phrase \"variety that a chess duel can achieve\" suggests intricate plotting, intellectual complexity, strategic maneuvering between characters, and psychological depth. The combination points to a work that is both emotionally powerful and intellectually rigorous.\n    *   **The Author Description:** This is a very specific literary critique. William Faulkner is renowned for his complex, stream-of-consciousness narrative style, labyrinthine sentences, and his creation of the fictional Yoknapatawpha County to explore themes of decay, history, and the human condition in the American South. A \"continuator\" would be an author who works with similar themes and techniques. A \"simplifier\" would be one who adopts this Faulknerian spirit but uses a more direct or less syntactically convoluted prose, making the ideas more accessible.\n\n3.  **Trace the Source:** The first step is to locate where Borges made these statements. The quotes come from a prologue that Borges wrote for a specific novel. Such prologues were a common practice for Borges, and he used them to champion authors he admired.\n\n4.  **Identify the Author and Novel:** A search for these specific phrases in Borges's writings leads directly to the prologue he wrote for the 1961 edition of the novel **\"El astillero\" (\"The Shipyard\")** by the Uruguayan writer **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Connection:**\n    *   In the prologue to *El astillero*, Borges indeed writes that the novel possesses \"...la intensidad de un tigre y la variedad que puede alcanzar un duelo de ajedrez.\" (\"...the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\")\n    *   In the same text and in other critical essays, Borges and other critics firmly establish the connection between Onetti and Faulkner. Onetti created the mythical city of Santa Mar√≠a, a direct parallel to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha, as a setting for many of his novels to explore themes of existential despair, alienation, and decay. While his prose is dense and melancholic, it is generally considered less syntactically challenging than Faulkner's most complex works, perfectly fitting the description of a \"continuator (and simplifier).\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, both the specific quote and the description of the author point unequivocally to one work and its creator.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe novel is **\"El astillero\" (\"The Shipyard\")** by the Uruguayan author **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n\n<<<The novel is \"El astillero\" (\"The Shipyard\") by Juan Carlos Onetti.>>>"
