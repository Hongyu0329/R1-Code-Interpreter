    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n**1. Understand the Meter**\nThe line is an iambic senarius (also known as an iambic trimeter), which consists of six iambic feet. The basic pattern for an iambic foot is a short syllable followed by a long syllable (S L).\nThe base meter is: S L | S L | S L | S L | S L | S L\nHowever, substitutions are common, especially in Roman comedy (Plautus):\n*   A spondee (L L), anapest (S S L), dactyl (L S S), or tribrach (S S S) can replace an iamb in various positions.\n*   A trochee (L S) is also often found, particularly in the odd-numbered feet (1, 3, 5).\n\n**2. Syllabification and Natural Quantities**\nFirst, we determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable based on its vowel and the consonants that follow.\n\n*   **`et`**: The vowel 'e' is naturally short, but it is followed by two consonants ('t' from `et` and 't' from the beginning of `tibi`). This makes the syllable **long (L)** by position.\n*   **`ti-bi`**: Both 'i's are naturally short and followed by a single consonant. Both syllables are **short (S)**.\n*   **`be-ne`**: Both 'e's are naturally short and followed by a single consonant. Both syllables are **short (S)**.\n*   **`es-se`**: The first 'e' is followed by a double consonant 'ss', making the syllable `es-` **long (L)** by position. The final 'e' in `-se` is short, making the syllable **short (S)**.\n*   **`so-li`**: In the word `solus` (here in the dative `soli`), both the 'o' and the 'i' are naturally long. Both syllables are **long (L)**.\n*   **`quom`**: This is an older spelling of `cum`. The vowel is naturally long. The syllable is **long (L)**.\n*   **`si-bi`**: Both 'i's are naturally short. Both syllables are **short (S)**.\n*   **`sit`**: The 'i' is naturally short, but it is followed by two consonants ('t' from `sit` and 'm' from the beginning of `male`). This makes the syllable **long (L)** by position.\n*   **`ma-le`**: Both 'a' and 'e' are naturally short. Both syllables are **short (S)**.\n\n**3. Handle Elision**\nWhen a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, the first vowel is elided (dropped).\n*   `bene esse`: The final `-ne` of `bene` is elided before the initial `e-` of `esse`. This means the syllable `-ne` is not scanned.\n\n**4. Divide into Feet (Iterative Process)**\nNow we must group the syllables into six metrical feet, respecting the rules of substitution. This is often like solving a puzzle.\n\n*   **Foot 6 (The End):** An iambic line must end in an iambic foot (S L). The last word is `male`, which scans as S S. The principle of *brevis in longo* (\"short in a long place\") allows the final syllable of a line to be treated as long to fit the meter.\n    *   `ma-le` -> **S L**. This is a valid iamb.\n\n*   **Foot 5:** The syllables before `male` are `si-bi sit`. This scans as S S L.\n    *   `si-bi sit` -> **S S L**. This is an anapest, which is a valid substitution for an iamb in the fifth foot.\n\n*   **Foot 4:** The syllables before `sibi sit` are `-li` (the end of `soli`) and `quom`. These scan as L L.\n    *   `-li quom` -> **L L**. This is a spondee, a valid substitution in the fourth foot.\n\n*   **Foot 3:** The syllables before `-li quom` are `-se` (the end of `esse`) and `so-` (the start of `soli`). These scan as S L.\n    *   `-se so-` -> **S L**. This is a perfect iamb.\n\n*   **Foot 2:** Now it gets trickier. We have used `esse`, `soli`, `quom`, `sibi`, `sit`, and `male`. The remaining syllables are from `et tibi bene`. After elision, the sound stream is `...benesse...`. We have used `-se` from `esse`. So we have `et ti-bi be-` and `es-`. Let's assemble the syllables for Foot 2 from what remains before Foot 3. These are `-bi` (from `tibi`), `be-` (from `bene`), and `es-` (from `esse`, with the elision of `bene`'s `-ne`). These scan as S S L.\n    *   `-bi be n(e) es-` -> **S S L**. This is an anapest, a valid substitution in the second foot.\n\n*   **Foot 1 (The Beginning):** The only syllables left are `et ti-`. These scan as L S.\n    *   `et ti-` -> **L S**. This is a trochee. A trochaic substitution in the first foot is common in Plautine comedy.\n\n**5. Final Result**\nBy piecing the feet together, we arrive at the complete scansion:\n\nFoot 1: `et ti-` (L S)\nFoot 2: `-bi be n(e) es-` (S S L)\nFoot 3: `-se so-` (S L)\nFoot 4: `-li quom` (L L)\nFoot 5: `si-bi sit` (S S L)\nFoot 6: `ma-le` (S L)\n\nThe complete pattern is: **L S S S L S L L L S S L S L**\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
