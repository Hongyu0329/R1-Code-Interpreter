    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the properties of filled groups and groups of order 2q^m.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understand the definitions.**\n*   **Product-free set S:** For all a, b ∈ S, the product ab ∉ S.\n*   **Maximal product-free set:** A product-free set that is not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n*   **Filled group:** A group G where every maximal product-free set generates G.\n*   **The group G:** We are looking for nonabelian groups G of order |G| = 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number (m ≥ 1).\n\n**2. Use the characterization of filled groups.**\nA crucial result from group theory (by R. Stöhr and P. Street) provides a convenient characterization of filled groups:\nA finite group G is filled if and only if one of the following holds:\n(i) G is an elementary abelian 2-group.\n(ii) G/Φ(G) is a cyclic group of prime order, where Φ(G) is the Frattini subgroup of G.\n\nWe are looking for nonabelian groups, so case (i) is ruled out as elementary abelian groups are abelian. Therefore, we must satisfy case (ii).\n*   **Careful point:** The Frattini subgroup Φ(G) is the intersection of all maximal subgroups of G. It is the set of non-generators of G.\n\n**3. Analyze the structure of groups of order 2q^m.**\nLet G be a group of order |G| = 2q^m, with q an odd prime.\n*   By Sylow's Theorems, let n_q be the number of Sylow q-subgroups. n_q must divide 2 and satisfy n_q ≡ 1 (mod q). Since q is an odd prime (q ≥ 3), n_q cannot be 2 (as 2 <binary data, 3 bytes> 1 mod q). Thus, n_q = 1.\n*   This means there is a unique Sylow q-subgroup, which we call Q. A unique Sylow subgroup is always normal in G. So, Q ◁ G and |Q| = q^m.\n*   The existence of the normal subgroup Q implies that G is a semidirect product G = Q ⋊ P, where P is a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2. Let P ≅ Z_2.\n*   Since G is nonabelian, the semidirect product must not be a direct product, which means the action of P on Q by conjugation is non-trivial. (Although this point will be revisited later).\n\n**4. Analyze the condition G/Φ(G) being cyclic of prime order.**\nLet G/Φ(G) be cyclic of prime order p.\n*   By Lagrange's theorem, p must divide |G/Φ(G)|, which in turn divides |G|=2q^m. Thus, p must be either 2 or q.\n*   Now let's analyze Φ(G). Since Q is a normal subgroup of G, we can consider the quotient map f: G → G/Q. A standard theorem states that f(Φ(G)) ≤ Φ(f(G)).\n    *   f(G) = G/Q, which has order 2. So G/Q ≅ Z_2.\n    *   Φ(f(G)) = Φ(Z_2). The only maximal subgroup of Z_2 is the trivial subgroup {e}, so Φ(Z_2) = {e}.\n    *   f(Φ(G)) = Φ(G)Q/Q.\n    *   The inequality becomes Φ(G)Q/Q ≤ {e}, which means Φ(G)Q = Q. This implies that **Φ(G) is a subgroup of Q**.\n*   **Careful point:** This implies that Φ(G) must be a q-group, as Q is a q-group. The order of Φ(G) must be a power of q.\n*   Now we check the two possibilities for p:\n    *   **Case a: p = q.** This would mean |G/Φ(G)| = q. Then |Φ(G)| = |G|/q = 2q^(m-1). Since q is an odd prime, this order is not a power of q (unless m=1 and q=1, or 2=1, both impossible). This contradicts the fact that Φ(G) is a q-group. So this case is impossible.\n    *   **Case b: p = 2.** This means |G/Φ(G)| = 2. Then |Φ(G)| = |G|/2 = q^m. Since we know Φ(G) ≤ Q and |Q| = q^m, we must have **Φ(G) = Q**.\n\n**5. Conclude the necessary condition.**\nFrom the analysis above, a nonabelian group G of order 2q^m is filled if and only if its Frattini subgroup is equal to its Sylow q-subgroup: Φ(G) = Q.\n\n**6. Analyze the condition Φ(G) = Q.**\n*   A group of order 2q^m is soluble by Burnside's p^a q^b theorem.\n*   For a soluble group G, a theorem by W. Gaschütz states that a Sylow p-subgroup P is contained in the Frattini subgroup Φ(G) if and only if G has a normal p-complement.\n*   Applying this theorem to our group G (which is soluble) and its Sylow q-subgroup Q, we have: **Q ≤ Φ(G) if and only if G has a normal q-complement.**\n*   A q-complement in G is a subgroup of order |G|/|Q| = 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup P.\n*   So, the condition Q ≤ Φ(G) is equivalent to the Sylow 2-subgroup P being a normal subgroup of G.\n*   The condition Φ(G) = Q certainly implies Q ≤ Φ(G). Therefore, for G to be a filled group, its Sylow 2-subgroup P must be normal.\n\n**7. Arrive at a contradiction.**\n*   If the Sylow 2-subgroup P is normal, and we already know the Sylow q-subgroup Q is normal, then G must be their direct product, since their orders are coprime: G = Q × P ≅ Q × Z_2.\n*   For G = Q × Z_2 to be nonabelian, the group Q must be nonabelian. (This requires m ≥ 3, since all groups of order q and q^2 are abelian).\n*   Now we must check if our condition Φ(G) = Q can be satisfied for G = Q × Z_2. The Frattini subgroup of a direct product is the direct product of the Frattini subgroups:\n    Φ(G) = Φ(Q × Z_2) = Φ(Q) × Φ(Z_2) = Φ(Q) × {e} = Φ(Q).\n*   So the condition Φ(G) = Q becomes **Φ(Q) = Q**.\n*   However, for any non-trivial finite p-group (here, Q is a non-trivial q-group since m≥1), its Frattini subgroup Φ(Q) is always a proper subgroup of Q. The equality Φ(Q)=Q holds only if Q is the trivial group.\n*   This gives a contradiction. The condition Φ(Q) = Q can never be satisfied for the non-trivial group Q.\n\n**8. Final Conclusion.**\nThe assumption that a nonabelian filled group of order 2q^m exists leads to a logical contradiction. Therefore, no such groups exist.\n\nFinal check of the steps: The reasoning relies on standard theorems of finite group theory (Sylow, Frattini subgroups, soluble groups) and the specific characterization of filled groups. Every step in the logical chain is sound. The conclusion is that the set of such groups is empty."
