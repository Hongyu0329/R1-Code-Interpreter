    "This question is a well-known piece of mycological trivia that hinges on a common misconception. Let's analyze it carefully.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Core Claim:** The question asserts that \"There is a single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print.\"\n\n2.  **Scientific Fact-Checking:** From a strictly scientific and mycological standpoint, this claim is false. There are no mushroom genera that are documented to produce a truly or \"distinctly\" blue spore print. Spore prints occur in a wide spectrum of colors including white, cream, yellow, pink, salmon, various shades of brown (ochre, rusty, chocolate), purple-brown, black, and even olive green. However, blue is conspicuously absent from this list in scientific literature and field guides.\n\n3.  **Identify Careful Points and Sources of Confusion:** Since the premise is incorrect, the question is likely a trick question or based on a popular myth. The confusion usually arises from one of three areas:\n    *   **Conflating Mushroom Color with Spore Color:** This is the most common mistake. There are several mushrooms that are themselves blue, leading people to assume their spores are also blue. The most famous example is ***Lactarius indigo***. This mushroom is a striking indigo blue, and it even \"bleeds\" blue latex (milk) when cut. However, its spore print is actually a cream-to-yellow color.\n    *   **Conflating a Staining Reaction with Spore Color:** Many mushrooms have flesh that changes color when cut or bruised. A well-known example is ***Gyroporus cyanescens***, a bolete that stains a brilliant blue almost instantly when handled. Despite this dramatic color change, its spore print is pale yellow. Many species in the genera *Boletus* and *Psilocybe* also stain blue but do not have blue spores.\n    *   **Misinterpreting Similar Colors:** Some spore prints are a dark lilac or purplish-brown color, which in certain lighting might be perceived as a shade of blue. For example, some species in the genus ***Stropharia*** have blue or blue-green caps and produce a purplish-brown spore print. This is not distinctly blue.\n\n4.  **Acquiring the Final Answer:** Given that the question is based on a false premise, we must deduce the most likely intended answer for a trivia setting. The answer would be the genus most famous for its blue characteristics, which leads to the misconception. As noted in the points above, the most iconic blue mushroom is *Lactarius indigo*. Because it is blue through-and-through (cap, gills, and latex), it is the most common subject of the incorrect assumption that its spores must also be blue. Therefore, the genus this question is alluding to is *Lactarius*.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Lactarius}$."
