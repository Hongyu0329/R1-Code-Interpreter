    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue: The quote from Andrei Voznesensky.**\nThe question states that the poet Andrei Voznesensky called the man \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This specific, poetic phrase is a key identifier. It comes from Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\" which is the literary basis for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (*Юнона и Авось*). The protagonist of this opera is the man we are looking for.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\".**\nThe main character of the opera is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the leaders of the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth. He sailed on the ships *Juno* and *Avos* to California in the early 19th century. The description \"sailor\" fits his role as the commander of this expedition. \"Joy-discovering\" is a poetic reference to his mission to establish trade relations and also to his famous romance with Concepción Argüello in California.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second clue: The question about the grave.**\nVoznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\", points to the fact that the man's burial site was unknown or had been lost at the time the poem was written. Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk while returning from his expedition. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, in the 1930s, under Soviet rule, the cathedral and the cemetery were demolished, and his grave was lost. This fact perfectly aligns with the poet's question.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third clue: The discovery in the late 1980s.**\nThe question states that the \"answer\" to the location of the grave emerged in the late 1980s. The immense popularity of the \"Juno and Avos\" rock opera in the USSR sparked public interest in the historical figure of Rezanov. This led to a public campaign in the late 1980s to locate and re-establish a memorial for him. While his physical remains were not found, a symbolic gravestone was placed in the Troitskoe Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk. This act of public recognition and memorialization served as the \"answer\" that emerged during that time.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the clues.**\nAll three clues point directly to Nikolai Rezanov:\n1.  He is the \"joy-discovering sailor\" from Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos\".\n2.  His grave was destroyed and lost for decades, prompting the question \"Where is your grave?\".\n3.  Efforts to memorialize his grave and publicly \"answer\" the question of its location occurred in the late 1980s, driven by the fame of the opera.\n\nTherefore, the last name of the man is Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
