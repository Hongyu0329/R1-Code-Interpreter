    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Defining \"Valid Expression\"\n\nThe problem asks for the number of boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols that evaluate to `True`. The available symbols are `T, F, !, &, |, (, )`.\n\nA \"valid boolean expression\" is not just any string of 5 symbols. It must be syntactically correct. The problem specifies operator precedence (`! > & > |`), which is a standard convention. To resolve ambiguity for operators of the same precedence (e.g., in `A & B & C`), we must also assume a convention for associativity. The standard is left-associativity for `&` and `|`.\n\nThis means:\n- `A | B & C` is parsed as `A | (B & C)`.\n- `!A & B` is parsed as `(!A) & B`.\n- `A | B | C` is parsed as `(A | B) | C`.\n- `A & B & C` is parsed as `(A & B) & C`.\n\n### Step 2: A Strategy for Counting Expressions\n\nWe can count the number of valid expressions by building them up from smaller expressions. This is a dynamic programming approach. To correctly handle the parsing rules (precedence and associativity), we can't just count all expressions of a certain length. We need to categorize them by their top-level operator.\n\nLet's define the following categories of expressions:\n1.  **Literals**: `T`, `F`.\n2.  **Parenthesized expressions**: `(E)`, where `E` is any valid expression.\n3.  **Negations**: `!E`, where `E` is any valid expression.\n4.  **Conjunctions (`&`)**: `E1 & E2`. Due to precedence, `E1` and `E2` cannot have `|` as their top-level operator. Due to left-associativity, `E2` cannot have `&` as its top-level operator.\n5.  **Disjunctions (`|`)**: `E1 | E2`. Due to left-associativity, `E2` cannot have `|` as its top-level operator.\n\nWe can define DP states based on these categories. Let `T(n)` be the count of true expressions of length `n`, and `F(n)` be the count of false expressions of length `n`. We need finer-grained counts to handle the rules:\n\n-   `T(n)` / `F(n)`: Total count for expressions of length `n`.\n-   `T_np(n)` / `F_np(n)`: Count for expressions of length `n` that do **not** have `|` as the top-level operator (i.e., are \"no-pipe\").\n-   `T_npna(n)` / `F_npna(n)`: Count for expressions of length `n` that have **neither `|` nor `&`** as the top-level operator (i.e., are \"no-pipe-no-and\"). These are literals, negations, or parenthesized expressions.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Recurrence Relations\n\nAn expression is formed from sub-expressions. For an expression of length `n`, its constituent parts must have a total length that sums to `n`.\n-   `T_npna(n) = T_!(n) + T_P(n) + T_lit(n)` (and similarly for `F`)\n    -   `!E`: length `n`, `E` has length `n-1`. `!E` is true if `E` is false. So `T_!(n) = F(n-1)`.\n    -   `(E)`: length `n`, `E` has length `n-2`. `(E)` is true if `E` is true. So `T_P(n) = T(n-2)`.\n    -   `T_lit(n)` is 1 if `n=1` (for `T`), and 0 otherwise.\n\n-   `T_np(n) = T_npna(n) + T_&(n)` (and similarly for `F`)\n    -   `E1 & E2`: length `n`, so `len(E1) + len(E2) = n-1`.\n    -   Due to left-associativity, `E1` can be `no-pipe`, but `E2` must be `no-pipe-no-and`.\n    -   `T_&(n) = sum_{i+j=n-1} [T_np(i) * T_npna(j)]`\n\n-   `T(n) = T_np(n) + T_|(n)` (and similarly for `F`)\n    -   `E1 | E2`: length `n`, so `len(E1) + len(E2) = n-1`.\n    -   Due to left-associativity, `E1` can be any expression, but `E2` must be `no-pipe`.\n    -   `E1 | E2` is true if `E1` is true OR `E2` is true.\n    -   `T_|(n) = sum_{i+j=n-1} [T(i)*T_np(j) + T(i)*F_np(j) + F(i)*T_np(j)]`\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**n = 1:**\n-   `T_lit(1) = 1` (`T`), `F_lit(1) = 1` (`F`).\n-   `T(1) = T_np(1) = T_npna(1) = 1`.\n-   `F(1) = F_np(1) = F_npna(1) = 1`.\n\n**n = 2:**\n-   `T_!(2) = F(1) = 1` (`!F`). `F_!(2) = T(1) = 1` (`!T`).\n-   `T_npna(2) = T_!(2) = 1`. `F_npna(2) = 1`.\n-   `T_np(2) = T_npna(2) = 1`. `F_np(2) = 1`.\n-   `T(2) = T_np(2) = 1`. `F(2) = 1`.\n\n**n = 3:**\n-   `T_!(3) = F(2) = 1`. `F_!(3) = T(2) = 1`.\n-   `T_P(3) = T(1) = 1`. `F_P(3) = F(1) = 1`.\n-   `T_npna(3) = 1 + 1 = 2`. `F_npna(3) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n-   `T_&(3)` (split 1+1): `T_np(1) * T_npna(1) = 1 * 1 = 1`. `F_&(3) = (1+1)*(1+1) - 1 = 3`.\n-   `T_np(3) = T_npna(3) + T_&(3) = 2 + 1 = 3`. `F_np(3) = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n-   `T_|(3)` (split 1+1): `T(1)T_np(1)+T(1)F_np(1)+F(1)T_np(1) = 1*1+1*1+1*1 = 3`.\n-   `T(3) = T_np(3) + T_|(3) = 3 + 3 = 6`. `F(3) = 5 + (1*1) = 6`.\n\n**n = 4:**\n-   `T_!(4) = F(3) = 6`. `F_!(4) = T(3) = 6`.\n-   `T_P(4) = T(2) = 1`. `F_P(4) = F(2) = 1`.\n-   `T_npna(4) = 6 + 1 = 7`. `F_npna(4) = 6 + 1 = 7`.\n-   `T_&(4)` (splits 1+2, 2+1):\n    -   1+2: `T_np(1) * T_npna(2) = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n    -   2+1: `T_np(2) * T_npna(1) = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n    -   `T_&(4) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n-   `T_np(4) = T_npna(4) + T_&(4) = 7 + 2 = 9`.\n-   `T_|(4)` (splits 1+2, 2+1):\n    -   1+2: `T(1)T_np(2)+T(1)F_np(2)+F(1)T_np(2) = 1*1+1*1+1*1 = 3`.\n    -   2+1: `T(2)T_np(1)+T(2)F_np(1)+F(2)T_np(1) = 1*1+1*1+1*1 = 3`.\n    -   `T_|(4) = 3 + 3 = 6`.\n-   `T(4) = T_np(4) + T_|(4) = 9 + 6 = 15`.\n\n**n = 5:**\n-   `T_!(5) = F(4) = 15`.\n-   `T_P(5) = T(3) = 6`.\n-   `T_npna(5) = T_!(5) + T_P(5) = 15 + 6 = 21`.\n-   `T_&(5)` (splits 1+3, 2+2, 3+1):\n    -   1+3: `T_np(1) * T_npna(3) = 1 * 2 = 2`.\n    -   2+2: `T_np(2) * T_npna(2) = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n    -   3+1: `T_np(3) * T_npna(1) = 3 * 1 = 3`.\n    -   `T_&(5) = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6`.\n-   `T_np(5) = T_npna(5) + T_&(5) = 21 + 6 = 27`.\n-   `T_|(5)` (splits 1+3, 2+2, 3+1):\n    -   1+3: `T(1)T_np(3) + T(1)F_np(3) + F(1)T_np(3) = 1*3 + 1*5 + 1*3 = 11`.\n    -   2+2: `T(2)T_np(2) + T(2)F_np(2) + F(2)T_np(2) = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3`.\n    -   3+1: `T(3)T_np(1) + T(3)F_np(1) + F(3)T_np(1) = 6*1 + 6*1 + 6*1 = 18`.\n    -   `T_|(5) = 11 + 3 + 18 = 32`.\n-   **`T(5) = T_np(5) + T_|(5) = 27 + 32 = 59`.**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis assuming standard operator precedence and left-associativity, the number of syntactically unique boolean expressions of length 5 that evaluate to True is 59.\n\n<<<59>>>"
