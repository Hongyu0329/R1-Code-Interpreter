    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key entities in the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific detail from the 1997 movie *Ovosodo* (titled *Hard Boiled Egg* in English). The key elements are:\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (1997)\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n*   **Information needed:** The specific US city he moves to.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the character's context within the film's plot.**\nIn *Ovosodo*, Tommaso is the best friend of the protagonist, Piero Mansani. Tommaso comes from a wealthy, intellectual family, which provides a stark contrast to Piero's working-class background. Their differing life trajectories are a central theme of the film.\n\n**Step 3: Isolate the specific plot point of Tommaso's move.**\nA significant event after they finish high school is Tommaso's decision to leave their hometown of Livorno, Italy, to study abroad. This move symbolizes the different opportunities available to him compared to Piero. The film makes it clear that he moves to the United States.\n\n**Step 4: Research the specific location mentioned in the film.**\nTo find the exact city, one needs to recall the specific scene or find a detailed plot summary of the movie. In the film's narrative, Tommaso communicates with Piero after his move, typically through postcards. These communications reveal his location. A review of the film's plot confirms that Tommaso moves to California to study.\n\n**Step 5: Pinpoint the city.**\nMultiple detailed summaries and analyses of *Ovosodo* confirm that the specific US city where Tommaso moves to is San Francisco. He embraces the city's counter-culture lifestyle, and his experiences there further highlight the divergence of his path from Piero's.\n\n<<<San Francisco>>>"
