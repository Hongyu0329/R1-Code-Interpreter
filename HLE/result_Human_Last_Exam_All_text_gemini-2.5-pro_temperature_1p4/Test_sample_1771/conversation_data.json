    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form\n\n*   **PIE Form:** *seh₂g-ie-ti*\n*   **Root:** The root is *seh₂g-*. Its meaning, confirmed by cognates like Latin *sāgīre* ('to perceive keenly, be keen-nosed') and Hittite *sākizzi* ('gives a sign, an omen'), is related to 'tracking, perceiving, or seeking out'.\n*   **Phonological Breakdown:**\n    *   *s*: An initial sibilant.\n    *   *e*: The vowel of the root, in its normal e-grade.\n    *   *h₂*: The second laryngeal consonant. In this position (between a vowel and another consonant), *h₂* \"colors\" an adjacent *e* to *a*. The evidence from Latin and Hittite suggests that the outcome was a long vowel, *ā*. This means the pre-Germanic root form was effectively *sāg-*.\n    *   *g*: A voiced velar stop.\n*   **Suffix:** The *-ie/o-* suffix forms a thematic present tense verb. The ending *-ti* is the 3rd person singular active ending.\n\n### Step 2: Trace from PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\nTo get from PIE to Proto-Germanic, we must apply the characteristic Germanic sound laws.\n\n1.  **Vowel Changes:** The long vowel *ā* (derived from PIE *eh₂) regularly becomes a long *ō* in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   PIE *seh₂g-* > Pre-Germanic *sāg-* > PGmc *sōk-* (vowel change applied)\n\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** This law affects the stop consonants. The relevant part here is the shift of voiced stops to voiceless stops.\n    *   PIE *g* > PGmc *k*.\n    *   PIE *s* remains *s* in this initial position.\n    *   Applying this to our root: Pre-Germanic *sāg-* > PGmc **\\*sōk-**.\n\n3.  **Verb Formation:** The PIE present suffix *-ie/o-* often corresponds to the Class 1 weak verb formation in Proto-Germanic, which uses the suffix *-janą*. These verbs are frequently causative or denominative. The verb 'to seek' fits this pattern well.\n    *   Therefore, the infinitive form in Proto-Germanic is **\\*sōkjaną**.\n\n### Step 3: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages\n\nThe PGmc form *\\*sōkjaną* undergoes further changes in the individual Germanic languages, primarily due to **i-umlaut** (the fronting of a root vowel caused by an /i/ or /j/ in the following syllable) and changes to the consonant cluster **-kj-**.\n\n**A. Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The *-j-* in *\\*sōkjaną* causes i-umlaut of the root vowel *ō*. In Old Norse, i-umlaut of *ō* results in *œ*.\n    *   *\\*sōk-* > *sœk-*\n2.  **Consonant Cluster:** The cluster *-kj-* remains largely unchanged in its pronunciation.\n3.  **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc ending *-aną* becomes *-a* in Old Norse.\n4.  **Result:** Combining these changes, PGmc *\\*sōkjaną* becomes Old Norse **sœkja**.\n\n**B. Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The *-j-* causes i-umlaut of the root vowel *ō*. In Old English, i-umlaut of *ō* results in *ē*.\n    *   *\\*sōk-* > *sēk-*\n2.  **Palatalization:** The consonant cluster *-kj-* undergoes palatalization in Old English, becoming the affricate /tʃ/, which is spelled as <c> or <ċ>.\n    *   *-kjan* > *-can* (/tʃan/)\n3.  **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc ending *-aną* becomes *-an* in Old English.\n4.  **Result:** Combining these changes, PGmc *\\*sōkjaną* becomes Old English **sēcan**.\n\n**C. Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The *-j-* causes i-umlaut of the root vowel *ō*. In Old High German, i-umlaut of *ō* results in the diphthong *uo*.\n    *   *\\*sōk-* > *suoh-*\n2.  **Consonant Change:** The consonant *k* before a *j* does not undergo the main High German Consonant Shift but is spirantized to a voiceless velar fricative /x/ and geminated (doubled). This is written as <hh>. The *j* is then lost.\n    *   *-kjan* > *-hhen*\n3.  **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc ending *-aną* becomes *-an* in Old High German.\n4.  **Result:** Combining these changes, PGmc *\\*sōkjaną* becomes Old High German **suohhen**.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *\\*sōkjaną*\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkja*\n*   **Old English:** *sēcan*\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhen*\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkjaną; Old Norse: sœkja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
