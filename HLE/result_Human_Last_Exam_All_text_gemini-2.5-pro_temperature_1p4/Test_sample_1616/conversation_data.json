    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine if it has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel becomes short (lax) if it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of a word) or earlier. A related process, often considered part of the same phonological rule, is the shortening of a long vowel before certain consonant clusters, especially when a suffix is added.\n\nThe core idea is to look for a pair of related words: one with a long vowel (like `sane`, /seɪn/) and a longer derived word where that same vowel becomes short (like `sanity`, /ˈsænəti/).\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Word**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Related word:** `south`\n    *   **Pronunciation:** `south` is pronounced /saʊθ/, with a long diphthong /aʊ/.\n    *   **Pronunciation of given word:** `southern` is pronounced /ˈsʌðərn/, with a short vowel /ʌ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** The long vowel /aʊ/ in `south` has been shortened to /ʌ/ in `southern` due to the addition of the suffix `-ern`. While `southern` is a two-syllable word, this shortening is a classic example of vowel laxing before a suffix. It has undergone laxing.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Related word:** `derive`\n    *   **Pronunciation:** `derive` is pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/, with a long diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   **Pronunciation of given word:** `derivative` is pronounced /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/, with a short vowel /ɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `derivative` has four syllables. The vowel in question is in the second syllable, which is the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. The long /aɪ/ has shortened to /ɪ/. This is a textbook example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Related word:** `serene`\n    *   **Pronunciation:** `serene` is pronounced /səˈriːn/, with a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Pronunciation of given word:** `serenity` is pronounced /səˈrɛnəti/, with a short vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `serenity` has four syllables. The vowel is in the antepenultimate position. The long /iː/ has shortened to /ɛ/. This is another clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Related word:** `please`\n    *   **Pronunciation:** `please` is pronounced /pliːz/, with a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Pronunciation of given word:** `pleasant` is pronounced /ˈplɛzənt/, with a short vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** The long vowel /iː/ in `please` has been shortened to /ɛ/ in `pleasant` upon adding the suffix `-ant`. Like `southern`, this is a case of vowel laxing, even though the resulting word has only two syllables. It has undergone laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Related word:** `grate` (as in `grateful`, /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/)\n    *   **Pronunciation:** The root vowel sound is long /eɪ/.\n    *   **Pronunciation of given word:** `gratitude` is pronounced /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/, with a short vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `gratitude` has three syllables. The vowel in question is in the first syllable, which is the antepenultimate position. The long /eɪ/ of the root has shortened to /æ/. This is another clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Related word:** `shade`\n    *   **Pronunciation:** `shade` is pronounced /ʃeɪd/, with a long diphthong /eɪ/. `shadow` is pronounced /ˈʃædoʊ/, with a short vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** Although there is a related word (`shade`) with a long vowel, the word `shadow` itself did not develop from a long-voweled form. Its Old English ancestor, *sceadu*, already had a short vowel /æ/. The word `shade` comes from a different form of the same root (*scead*) that underwent vowel lengthening, while *sceadu* did not. Therefore, the short vowel in `shadow` is original; it was not created by shortening a long vowel. The word `shadow` has not undergone trisyllabic laxing (or any other laxing process) because its vowel was never long to begin with.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nAll words in the list except for `shadow` show evidence of a long vowel in their base form being shortened (laxed) in the derived form. The word `shadow` inherited its short vowel directly from its Old English origin and did not undergo a shortening process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
