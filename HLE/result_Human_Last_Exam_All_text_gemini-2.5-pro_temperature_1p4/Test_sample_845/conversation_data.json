    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Technology Used:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture beat-to-beat intervals. PPG works by shining light on the skin and measuring changes in light absorption, which correspond to blood volume changes caused by the pulse.\n    *   **Metric Measured:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the metric being computed.\n    *   **Core Question:** What is the name of the \"value between heartbeats\" that serves as the basis for calculating HRV?\n\n2.  **Identify the Fundamental Measurement:**\n    *   HRV is not a direct measurement but a calculation based on a series of measurements.\n    *   The core measurement is the time duration that elapses between one heartbeat and the very next one. This series of time intervals is then analyzed to determine the \"variability.\"\n    *   For example, if the time between two beats is 800 milliseconds, and the time between the next two is 850 milliseconds, this 50ms difference is the \"variability.\" The raw values (800ms, 850ms, etc.) are the fundamental data points.\n\n3.  **Determine the Correct Terminology:**\n    *   The gold standard for measuring beat-to-beat intervals is the electrocardiogram (ECG), which records the electrical activity of the heart. The most prominent feature of an ECG waveform for a single heartbeat is the \"QRS complex,\" with the \"R-wave\" being the highest peak.\n    *   Therefore, the time interval between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**. This is the most common and standard term in clinical and research settings for the time between heartbeats.\n    *   While PPG measures pulse peaks (which can be called pulse-to-pulse intervals or PPIs) and not electrical R-waves, the data is used as a proxy for R-R intervals. In the context of HRV analysis, the term **R-R interval** is ubiquitously used to refer to the beat-to-beat interval, regardless of whether the source is an ECG or a PPG sensor. Another general term is **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**, but R-R interval is more specific and widely recognized in HRV literature.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Source vs. Terminology:** Be aware that while the *source* is PPG (measuring pulse peaks), the established *terminology* for the interval in HRV analysis comes from the ECG gold standard (R-R interval).\n*   **What is being measured:** The value is a measure of **time**, typically expressed in milliseconds (ms).\n*   **Synonyms:** While \"R-R interval\" is the most common, terms like \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" or \"Normal-to-Normal (NN) interval\" (which filters out abnormal beats) are also used in the field. However, \"R-R interval\" is the most direct and foundational answer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats to track HRV is the time duration between two consecutive beats. This specific value is most commonly called the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
