The ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio depends on the target reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal ratio is generally in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 to maximize the synergistic interface between Ni and Ceria. For thermochemical water splitting (WS), where Ni acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis step rather than a primary redox component, a lower ratio in the range of 0.05 to 0.15 is ideal to ensure high dispersion and avoid the formation of inactive phases. The precise optimum in both cases is highly dependent on the catalyst synthesis method and operating conditions.
