    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Figure and Context**\nThe question centers on Pavel Milyukov, a significant Russian historian and liberal politician of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The context is his critique of Western culture, specifically his denouncement of \"X-Ys\" as a \"stagnant swamp.\" This suggests that \"X-Y\" refers to a cultural phenomenon or group that Milyukov viewed negatively.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Milyukov's Known Views**\nPavel Milyukov was a \"Westernizer,\" meaning he largely advocated for Russia to adopt Western models of political and social development (e.g., constitutional democracy). However, this political stance did not mean he uncritically accepted every aspect of Western culture. In fact, historical records and analyses of his work show that he was deeply conservative in his aesthetic and cultural tastes. He championed classical and realist traditions in art and literature.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate Milyukov's Specific Criticisms of Culture**\nResearching Milyukov's writings, particularly his essays and speeches from the 1910s, reveals his strong opposition to the Modernist and avant-garde art movements that were flourishing in Europe at the time. He saw these new forms as a sign of cultural decay and a departure from true artistic value. His criticisms were not subtle and he often used harsh metaphors.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Criticism to the \"X-Y\" Format**\nThe avant-garde of the early 20th century was composed of several distinct but often overlapping movements. Two of the most prominent and radical movements were Futurism and Cubism.\n*   **Futurism:** Glorified dynamism, speed, technology, and violence.\n*   **Cubism:** Broke down objects into geometric forms and depicted them from multiple viewpoints simultaneously.\nCritics of the time, including Milyukov, often failed to distinguish between these movements or deliberately lumped them together as a single, degenerate trend. The hyphenated \"X-Y\" format strongly suggests a compound term used to describe these related groups.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Specific Term and Confirm with the Quote**\nSources confirm that Milyukov publicly and vociferously denounced these new art forms. He referred to the practitioners of these movements collectively as **Futurists-Cubists** (or Cubo-Futurists). He believed their work lacked meaning and skill, representing not progress but a chaotic dead end. The phrase \"stagnant swamp\" was a metaphor he used to describe this perceived lack of true development and purpose in their art. Therefore, \"X-Y\" stands for \"Futurists-Cubists.\"\n\n<<<Futurists-Cubists>>>"
