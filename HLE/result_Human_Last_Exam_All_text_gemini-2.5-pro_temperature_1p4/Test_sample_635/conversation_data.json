    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition**\nWe want to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$. This can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means that the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the governing equation**\nLet the unknown polynomial matrices be:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11} & d_{12} \\\\ d_{21} & d_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11} & n_{12} \\\\ n_{21} & n_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nMultiplying the matrices on the left side gives four equations:\n1.  $d_{11}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = n_{11}(s)$\n2.  $d_{11}(s) \\cdot 1 + d_{12}(s) \\cdot 0 = n_{12}(s) \\implies d_{11}(s) = n_{12}(s)$\n3.  $d_{21}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = n_{21}(s)$\n4.  $d_{21}(s) \\cdot 1 + d_{22}(s) \\cdot 0 = n_{22}(s) \\implies d_{21}(s) = n_{22}(s)$\n\nSince $d_{11}, d_{21}, n_{12}, n_{22}$ must all be polynomials, equations 2 and 4 are directly satisfied if we let $n_{12} = d_{11}$ and $n_{22} = d_{21}$.\n\nNow we rewrite equations 1 and 3 by putting them on a common denominator $s^2-1 = (s+1)(s-1)$:\n1.  $\\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1} = n_{11}(s) \\implies d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s) = n_{11}(s)(s^2-1)$\n3.  $\\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1} = n_{21}(s) \\implies d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s) = n_{21}(s)(s^2-1)$\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the polynomial entries**\nWe need to find the simplest polynomial solutions for these two independent equations.\nLet's solve for the first row ($d_{11}, d_{12}, n_{11}$).\n$d_{11}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12} = n_{11}(s^2-1)$.\nTo find a simple solution, let's try setting $d_{12}(s) = 0$. The equation becomes:\n$d_{11}(s-1)^2 = n_{11}(s-1)(s+1)$.\nAssuming $s \\neq 1$, we can divide by $(s-1)$:\n$d_{11}(s-1) = n_{11}(s+1)$.\nThe simplest non-trivial polynomial solution to this is to set $d_{11}(s) = s+1$ and $n_{11}(s) = s-1$.\nSo for the first row, we have:\n$d_{11}(s) = s+1$, $d_{12}(s) = 0$.\n$n_{11}(s) = s-1$, and from step 2, $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = s+1$.\n\nNow, let's solve for the second row ($d_{21}, d_{22}, n_{21}$).\n$d_{21}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22} = n_{21}(s^2-1)$.\nA property of a coprime factorization is that the determinant of $D(s)$ should be proportional to the characteristic polynomial of $H(s)$. The characteristic polynomial is the least common denominator of all minors of $H(s)$, which is $s^2-1$.\nWe have $\\det(D(s)) = d_{11}d_{22} - d_{12}d_{21} = (s+1)d_{22}(s) - 0 \\cdot d_{21}(s) = (s+1)d_{22}(s)$.\nTo make $\\det(D(s))$ proportional to $s^2-1$, we should choose $d_{22}(s)$ to be proportional to $(s-1)$. Let's choose $d_{22}(s) = s-1$.\nSubstitute this into the equation for the second row:\n$d_{21}(s-1)^2 + 2(s-1) = n_{21}(s^2-1) = n_{21}(s-1)(s+1)$.\nAssuming $s \\neq 1$, we divide by $(s-1)$:\n$d_{21}(s-1) + 2 = n_{21}(s+1)$.\nWe need to find simple polynomials $d_{21}(s)$ and $n_{21}(s)$ that satisfy this. Let's try constant polynomials, $d_{21}(s) = c_1$ and $n_{21}(s)=c_2$.\n$c_1(s-1) + 2 = c_2(s+1) \\implies c_1s - c_1 + 2 = c_2s + c_2$.\nMatching coefficients of $s$: $c_1=c_2$.\nMatching constant terms: $-c_1+2=c_2$.\nSubstituting $c_1=c_2$ gives $-c_1+2=c_1 \\implies 2c_1 = 2 \\implies c_1=1$.\nSo, $c_1=c_2=1$. This gives $d_{21}(s)=1$ and $n_{21}(s)=1$.\nSo for the second row, we have:\n$d_{21}(s) = 1$, $d_{22}(s) = s-1$.\n$n_{21}(s) = 1$, and from step 2, $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the matrices and verify**\nCombining our results:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet's check the factorization:\n$D^{-1}(s)N(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+1)(s-1)} \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$= \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & (s-1)(s+1) \\\\ -(s-1)+(s+1) & -(s+1)+(s+1) \\end{bmatrix}$\n$= \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{(s-1)^2}{s^2-1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = H(s)$.\nThe factorization is correct.\n\n**Step 5: Verify coprimeness**\nWe check the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ at the roots of $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n$[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nAt $s=1$:\n$[D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The rows are linearly independent (e.g., the minor from columns 1 and 3 is $2 \\neq 0$). The rank is 2.\n\nAt $s=-1$:\n$[D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The rows are linearly independent (e.g., the minor from columns 1 and 3 is $2 \\neq 0$). The rank is 2.\n\nSince the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full rank for all $s$, the factorization is left coprime.\n\nFinal Answer:\nA left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n>>> $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}, N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$"
