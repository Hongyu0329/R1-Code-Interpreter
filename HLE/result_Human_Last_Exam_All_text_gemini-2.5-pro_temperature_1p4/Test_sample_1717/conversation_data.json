    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Base Health in Expert Mode**\n\nFirst, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu for a single player in Expert Mode.\n*   In Normal Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has **2800** health.\n*   In Expert Mode, this base health is increased. According to the game's source code, the Eye of Cthulhu's health is set to **3640** for a single player in an Expert Mode world. This will be our starting value.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula**\n\nNext, we must understand how boss health scales with the number of players in Expert Mode.\n*   The game increases a boss's maximum health for each additional player in the server during the fight.\n*   In Expert Mode, the source code specifies that boss health is increased by **35%** of its base Expert Mode health for each player present after the first one.\n*   This is an additive increase, not a compounding one.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Health Equation**\n\nLet's create a formula to calculate the total health based on the number of players.\n*   Let `H(N)` be the health of the boss with `N` players.\n*   Let `H_base_expert` be the base health in Expert Mode for one player, which is 3640.\n*   The number of *additional* players is `(N - 1)`.\n*   The health increase per additional player is `H_base_expert * 0.35`.\n\nThe formula is:\n`H(N) = H_base_expert + (H_base_expert * 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n\nWe can substitute the value of `H_base_expert`:\n`H(N) = 3640 + (3640 * 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n`H(N) = 3640 + (1274 * (N - 1))`\n`H(N) = 3640 + 1274N - 1274`\n`H(N) = 2366 + 1274N`\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Formula for an Infinite Number of Players**\n\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This requires us to find the limit of our health function `H(N)` as `N` approaches infinity (∞).\n\n`lim (N -> ∞) [2366 + 1274N]`\n\nThe function `H(N) = 2366 + 1274N` is a linear function. As the number of players (`N`) increases, the total health increases linearly without any upper bound defined in the formula. As `N` approaches infinity, the term `1274N` also approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health also approaches infinity.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Game Mode:** The calculation is specifically for **Expert Mode**. Normal Mode and Master Mode use different base health values and/or scaling factors.\n2.  **Base Health:** It is crucial to start with the single-player Expert Mode health (**3640 HP**), not the Normal Mode health (2800 HP).\n3.  **Scaling Mechanism:** The scaling is an **additive 35%** of the base health for each extra player. It is not a compounding multiplication (e.g., `health * 1.35^(N-1)`), which would result in much faster growth.\n4.  **Theoretical vs. Practical Limits:** The question asks for the *theoretical* maximum. In practice, the game has a hard player limit (typically 255) and the health variable (`lifeMax`) is a 32-bit integer, capping it at 2,147,483,647. However, the mathematical formula itself does not contain a cap, so the theoretical limit is determined by the formula's behavior with an infinite input.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is described by the linear function `H(N) = 2366 + 1274N`. As the number of players `N` approaches infinity, the value of this function grows without bound. Thus, the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\n\n<<<Infinity>>>"
