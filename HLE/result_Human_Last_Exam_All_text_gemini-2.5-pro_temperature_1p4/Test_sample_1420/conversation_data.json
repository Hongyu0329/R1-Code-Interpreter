    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in $d=3$ using the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe question asks for a critical exponent within the framework of the renormalization group (RG) theory, specifically using the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. This method is used to study critical phenomena near an upper critical dimension, $d_c$. For systems like the Ising model or the more general n-vector model, which describe ferromagnetism and many other phase transitions, the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. Above this dimension, the critical exponents take on their classical, mean-field theory values.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Epsilon Expansion Parameter**\n\nThe epsilon expansion is a perturbative method where calculations are performed in a dimension $d$ slightly below the upper critical dimension $d_c$. The small parameter for the expansion is defined as:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d$\n\nIn our case, $d_c = 4$, so:\n$\\epsilon = 4 - d$\n\nThe question asks for the exponent in a spatial dimension $d=3$. Therefore, we will perform the calculation in terms of $\\epsilon$ and then substitute $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$ to get the final estimate. While $\\epsilon=1$ is not a small number, this procedure often gives surprisingly reasonable first-order approximations for critical exponents.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce Relevant Scaling Relations**\n\nCritical exponents are not all independent; they are connected by scaling relations. The specific heat exponent, $\\alpha$, is related to the correlation length exponent, $\\nu$, through the **hyperscaling relation**:\n\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ describes how the correlation length $\\xi$ diverges near the critical point: $\\xi \\sim |t|^{-\\nu}$, where $t$ is the reduced temperature. We can rearrange this relation to solve for $\\alpha$:\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\n**Step 4: Find the Expression for the Exponent $\\nu$ in the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nThe exponent $\\nu$ has been calculated using the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the general n-vector model (where $n$ is the number of components of the order parameter). To first order in $\\epsilon$, the result is:\n\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nThe question does not specify the model, but the standard and simplest case is the Ising model, which corresponds to $n=1$.\n\nFor the Ising model ($n=1$):\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1+2}{4(1+8)}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{36}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Exponent $\\alpha$ using the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ and $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation for $\\alpha$. It is crucial to substitute for both $d$ and $\\nu$ to maintain a consistent expansion in powers of $\\epsilon$.\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)\\right)$\n\nNow, expand the product and keep terms only up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon\\right) - \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\epsilon\\right) + ... \\right]$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n\nNow, combine the terms with $\\epsilon$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - 2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left(\\frac{2-3}{6}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nSo, the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ to first order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the Ising model is $\\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the Exponent for $d=3$**\n\nTo get the value of $\\alpha$ for a 3-dimensional system, we substitute $\\epsilon = 1$ into our first-order result:\n\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Model Assumption:** We assumed the Ising model ($n=1$), which is the most common interpretation when the model is not specified. The result depends on $n$.\n2.  **Upper Critical Dimension:** Correctly identifying $d_c=4$ is the starting point for the entire calculation.\n3.  **Consistent Expansion:** A common mistake is to substitute $d=3$ directly into the hyperscaling relation ($\\alpha = 2-3\\nu$). This is incorrect because the logic of the $\\epsilon$-expansion requires that the dimension $d$ itself is treated as an expansion parameter, $d=4-\\epsilon$. Both $d$ and $\\nu$ must be expanded in $\\epsilon$ for a consistent result.\n4.  **Approximation:** The final result is a first-order approximation. Higher-order terms in the $\\epsilon$-expansion would refine this value, and since we are evaluating at $\\epsilon=1$, the approximation is not expected to be perfectly accurate but provides a good estimate. (The accepted numerical value for $\\alpha$ in the 3D Ising model is closer to 0.110, while $1/6 \\approx 0.167$).\n\nThe final answer based on the specified method is the result of the first-order calculation.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
