    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action:** A character visits a Roman city.\n    *   **Description:** The character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Specific Reference:** The description is clearly recognizable to the reader as the myth of Romulus and Remus, specifically the part where they are suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify the context of the novel:** *The House of the Wolfings* is a fantasy romance that depicts a Germanic tribe (the Goths, specifically the Wolfing clan) in conflict with the invading Roman Empire. This establishes a cultural clash where the Goths would view Roman customs as foreign and strange.\n\n3.  **Search for a character who has been to Roman lands:** The primary narrative focuses on the Goths in their own land preparing for battle. However, early in the book, the tribe gathers to hear news and counsel. In this section, a character is introduced who has traveled extensively and lived among the Romans. This character is **Wood-Sun**, the sister of the chieftain Thiodolf.\n\n4.  **Locate the specific scene:** In Chapter IV, titled \"The House of the Wolfings heareth talk of the Romans,\" Wood-Sun addresses the assembled tribe. She is described as a woman who was once a captive of the Romans and therefore has firsthand knowledge of their society.\n\n5.  **Analyze the character's description:** During her speech, Wood-Sun aims to inform her people about the nature of the enemy. She describes their great, walled cities, their powerful and disciplined army, and their different way of life. Critically, she also describes their gods and religious imagery.\n\n6.  **Pinpoint the reference to Romulus and Remus:** Wood-Sun describes an image the Romans worship, which she finds particularly strange. She states that they have an image of **\"a she-wolf giving suck to two men-children\"** whom they revere. From her perspective as a Goth, where the wolf is a respected but wild animal (and the namesake of her clan), this image is bizarre. She doesn't know the names Romulus and Remus, but her description is unmistakable.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Perspective is key:** Morris uses Wood-Sun's perspective as an \"outsider\" to reframe a familiar myth. To the Roman-educated reader, the image of the Lupa Capitolina (Capitoline Wolf) is a foundational symbol of Rome. To Wood-Sun, it's the strange worship of a wild beast nursing human babies. This technique makes the Roman culture feel alien, aligning the reader's sympathy with the Goths.\n*   **Character's Role:** Wood-Sun's role is that of the \"bringer of news.\" Her travels and captivity provide the exposition necessary for the Wolfings (and the reader) to understand the nature of the Roman threat, not just militarily but culturally.\n*   **The specific passage:** The direct description is the undeniable clue. No other character provides such a detailed, firsthand account of Roman civic and religious life.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively identify the character. Wood-Sun is the only character who was held captive in a Roman city and returns to describe their culture, specifically mentioning the religious image of a she-wolf suckling two male infants, which is a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<Wood-Sun>>>"
