    "Here is a step-by-step analysis for scanning the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Write out the line and identify the syllables:**\n    `ve-rum u-bi e-qui at-que ho-mi-nis ca-su con-ve-nit i-ma-go.`\n\n2.  **Identify and apply elisions.** Elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel (or -m) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or h-). The first syllable is dropped or \"elided\" in scansion.\n    *   `ver**um u**bi`: The `-um` of `verum` elides with the `u` of `ubi`.\n    *   `ub**i e**qui`: The `-i` of `ubi` elides with the `e` of `equi`.\n    *   `atqu**e ho**minis`: The `-e` of `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis` (`h` does not prevent elision).\n\n3.  **Determine vowel quantities and group into feet.** A dactyl is Long-Short-Short (— U U), and a spondee is Long-Long (— —).\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `verum ubi e-`\n        *   The first syllable is `vē-` from `vērum` (the adverb, with a naturally long 'e'). It is **long**.\n        *   The syllable `rum` is elided. The next syllable is `u-` from `ubi`, which is naturally **short**.\n        *   The syllable `bi` is elided. The next syllable is `e-` from `equi`, which is naturally **short**.\n        *   This forms a Long-Short-Short pattern (— U U).\n        *   **Result: Dactyl (D)**\n\n    *   **Foot 2:** `-qui atque`\n        *   The second syllable of `equi` is `-qui`. This is from the genitive `equī`, so the `ī` is naturally **long**.\n        *   The first syllable of `atque` is `at-`. The 'a' is followed by two consonants ('t' and 'qu', which is a 'k' sound), making it **long** by position.\n        *   This forms a Long-Long pattern (— —).\n        *   **Result: Spondee (S)**\n\n    *   **Foot 3:** `-que hominis`\n        *   The syllable `-que` from `atque` is elided.\n        *   The foot begins with `ho-` from `hominis`, which is **long** by poetic license (normally it is short).\n        *   The second syllable, `-mi-`, is **short**.\n        *   The third syllable, `-nis`, is **short**.\n        *   This forms a Long-Short-Short pattern (— U U). This is a known difficult scansion in Lucretius, requiring the first syllable of `hominis` to be treated as long to fit the meter.\n        *   **Result: Dactyl (D)**\n\n    *   **Foot 4:** `casu`\n        *   The first syllable `cā-` is naturally **long**.\n        *   The second syllable `-sū` has a `u` that is normally short in the ablative, but it is scanned as **long** here by poetic license to create a spondee.\n        *   This forms a Long-Long pattern (— —).\n        *   **Result: Spondee (S)**\n\n    *   **Foot 5:** `convenit`\n        *   This must be the present tense form `convĕnit`.\n        *   The first syllable `con-` is **long** by position (followed by 'n' and 'v').\n        *   The second syllable `-ve-` is **short**.\n        *   The third syllable `-nit` is **short**.\n        *   This forms a Long-Short-Short pattern (— U U), which is expected for the fifth foot.\n        *   **Result: Dactyl (D)**\n\n    *   **Foot 6:** `imago`\n        *   The final foot must have two syllables.\n        *   The first syllable `i-` of `imago` is elided through synizesis, effectively blending with the second syllable.\n        *   The foot is formed by `(i)mā-` which is **long**, and `-gō`, whose final vowel is treated as **long** (*syllaba anceps*).\n        *   This forms a Long-Long pattern (— —).\n        *   **Result: Spondee (S)**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the six feet gives the complete scansion of the line.\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
