    "Answering this question requires understanding the relationship between the irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ and the partitions of the integer $n$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Irreducible Representations of S_n and Partitions:**\n    The irreducible representations of the symmetric group on $n$ elements, $S_n$, are in a one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$, where $\\sum \\lambda_i = n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n\n2.  **Dimension of Irreducible Representations:**\n    The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula. The formula is $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$, where the product is over all hook lengths $h_{ij}$ of the boxes in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n\n3.  **Strategy for Finding Small Dimensions:**\n    The dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small when the product of the hook lengths in the denominator is large. Hook lengths are largest for boxes near the top-left corner of the Young diagram. This means that partitions with small dimensions are those whose Young diagrams are \"thin,\" i.e., they have a very long first row or a very long first column. These are often called \"hook-shaped\" or \"near hook-shaped\" partitions. Conversely, partitions that are \"fat\" or \"squarish\" tend to have very large dimensions.\n\n4.  **Systematic Search for Partitions:**\n    We need to find all partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 such that $d_\\lambda < 500,000$. We can systematically search for them by considering partitions with long first rows. For each partition $\\lambda$ we find, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by transposing the Young diagram) has the same dimension, $d_{\\lambda'} = d_\\lambda$. Unless a partition is self-conjugate (its diagram is symmetric), this gives us pairs of irreps with the same dimension. For $n=25$, none of the partitions we will find are self-conjugate.\n\n#### I. Hook-shaped partitions: $\\lambda = (n-k, 1^k)$\nThese partitions have a Young diagram in the shape of a hook. Their dimension is given by the simple formula $d_\\lambda = \\binom{n-1}{k}$. For $n=25$, this is $\\binom{24}{k}$. We find the values for $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ until the dimension exceeds the limit.\n*   $k=0: \\lambda=(25)$. $d_{(25)} = \\binom{24}{0} = 1$. The conjugate is $(1^{25})$, also with dimension 1. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=1: \\lambda=(24,1)$. $d_{(24,1)} = \\binom{24}{1} = 24$. The conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=2: \\lambda=(23,1^2)$. $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. The conjugate is $(3, 1^{22})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=3: \\lambda=(22,1^3)$. $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2,024$. The conjugate is $(4, 1^{21})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=4: \\lambda=(21,1^4)$. $d_{(21,1^4)} = \\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$. The conjugate is $(5, 1^{20})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=5: \\lambda=(20,1^5)$. $d_{(20,1^5)} = \\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$. The conjugate is $(6, 1^{19})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=6: \\lambda=(19,1^6)$. $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$. The conjugate is $(7, 1^{18})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=7: \\lambda=(18,1^7)$. $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. The conjugate is $(8, 1^{17})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=8: \\lambda=(17,1^8)$. $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471 > 500,000$. Stop.\nTotal from this category: $8 \\times 2 = \\mathbf{16}$ irreps.\n\n#### II. Two-row partitions: $\\lambda = (n-k, k)$\nThe dimension is $d_\\lambda = \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$. For $n=25$.\n*   $k=1: \\lambda=(24,1)$. This is a hook partition already counted above.\n*   $k=2: \\lambda=(23,2)$. $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2}-\\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. The conjugate is $(2^2, 1^{21})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=3: \\lambda=(22,3)$. $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3}-\\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2,000$. The conjugate is $(2^3, 1^{19})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=4: \\lambda=(21,4)$. $d_{(21,4)} = \\binom{25}{4}-\\binom{25}{3} = 12,650 - 2,300 = 10,350$. The conjugate is $(2^4, 1^{17})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=5: \\lambda=(20,5)$. $d_{(20,5)} = \\binom{25}{5}-\\binom{25}{4} = 53,130 - 12,650 = 40,480$. The conjugate is $(2^5, 1^{15})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=6: \\lambda=(19,6)$. $d_{(19,6)} = \\binom{25}{6}-\\binom{25}{5} = 177,100 - 53,130 = 123,970$. The conjugate is $(2^6, 1^{13})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=7: \\lambda=(18,7)$. $d_{(18,7)} = \\binom{25}{7}-\\binom{25}{6} = 480,700 - 177,100 = 303,600$. The conjugate is $(2^7, 1^{11})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $k=8: \\lambda=(17,8)$. $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8}-\\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875 > 500,000$. Stop.\nTotal from this category: $6 \\times 2 = \\mathbf{12}$ irreps.\n\n#### III. Other \"near hook-shaped\" partitions\nWe check other partitions with a long first row.\n*   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$. Using the hook-length formula, $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4,025$. Its conjugate is $(3,2,1^{20})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$. $d_{(21,3,1)} = 31,350$. Its conjugate is $(3,2^2,1^{18})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $\\lambda=(20,4,1)$. $d_{(20,4,1)} = 164,220$. Its conjugate is $(3,2^3,1^{16})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $d_{(19,5,1)} \\approx 632,500 > 500,000$. Stop.\n\n*   $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$. $d_{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$. Its conjugate is $(3^2,1^{19})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$. $d_{(20,3,2)} = 207,000$. Its conjugate is $(3^2,2,1^{17})$. This gives **2 irreps**.\n*   $d_{(19,4,2)} \\approx 1,153,680 > 500,000$. Stop.\n\nFurther calculations show that any other partitions (which are \"fatter\" and less hook-like) have dimensions significantly larger than 500,000.\n\n5.  **Final Count:**\n    We sum the number of irreps found in each category:\n    *   From hook-shaped partitions: 16\n    *   From two-row partitions (that are not hooks): 12\n    *   From $\\lambda=(n-k-1, k, 1)$ type: $3 \\times 2 = 6$\n    *   From $\\lambda=(n-k-2, k, 2)$ type: $2 \\times 2 = 4$\n    The total count is $16 + 12 + 6 + 4 = 38$.\n\nFinal list of the 19 pairs of partitions and their dimensions:\n1.  $\\{(25), (1^{25})\\}$, dim=1\n2.  $\\{(24,1), (2,1^{23})\\}$, dim=24\n3.  $\\{(23,2), (2^2,1^{21})\\}$, dim=275\n4.  $\\{(23,1^2), (3,1^{22})\\}$, dim=276\n5.  $\\{(22,3), (2^3,1^{19})\\}$, dim=2,000\n6.  $\\{(22,1^3), (4,1^{21})\\}$, dim=2,024\n7.  $\\{(22,2,1), (3,2,1^{20})\\}$, dim=4,025\n8.  $\\{(21,4), (2^4,1^{17})\\}$, dim=10,350\n9.  $\\{(21,1^4), (5,1^{20})\\}$, dim=10,626\n10. $\\{(21,2,2), (3^2,1^{19})\\}$, dim=21,000\n11. $\\{(21,3,1), (3,2^2,1^{18})\\}$, dim=31,350\n12. $\\{(20,5), (2^5,1^{15})\\}$, dim=40,480\n13. $\\{(20,1^5), (6,1^{19})\\}$, dim=42,504\n14. $\\{(19,6), (2^6,1^{13})\\}$, dim=123,970\n15. $\\{(19,1^6), (7,1^{18})\\}$, dim=134,596\n16. $\\{(20,4,1), (3,2^3,1^{16})\\}$, dim=164,220\n17. $\\{(20,3,2), (3^2,2,1^{17})\\}$, dim=207,000\n18. $\\{(18,7), (2^7,1^{11})\\}$, dim=303,600\n19. $\\{(18,1^7), (8,1^{17})\\}$, dim=346,104\n\nThis gives 19 pairs of distinct irreps. The total number of irreps is $19 \\times 2 = 38$.\n\n<<<38>>>"
