    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the character the protagonist marries in Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\".\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the novel and its main character:** The novel is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (\"Perfect Imperfection\") by Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who has been cryogenically frozen and is resurrected in the late 29th century.\n\n2.  **Analyze the central relationship:** Upon his revival, Adam Zamoyski struggles to comprehend the post-human reality he finds himself in. A pivotal character in his journey is an *inkluza* (an \"inclusive,\" a highly advanced post-human being). This character guides him and develops a deep, complex relationship with him.\n\n3.  **Identify the name of the character:** This inkluza, who becomes Adam's partner and closest companion, is named Angelina.\n\n4.  **Understand the concept of \"marriage\" in the novel's context:** The term \"marriage\" as we understand it from the 21st century doesn't perfectly apply to the 29th-century post-human society depicted in the book. However, the relationship between Adam and Angelina evolves into the closest possible equivalent. It is a profound, permanent union that involves a partial merging of their consciousness and beings. This bond is the central romantic and philosophical relationship of the novel and functions as a marriage within the story's framework.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms this deep, marriage-like union with the inkluza named Angelina.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **The definition of \"marriage\":** It's crucial to understand that the concept of marriage is metaphorical here, representing a deep, futuristic union rather than a traditional ceremony.\n*   **Character roles:** Angelina is the primary female character and the love interest. There are other significant characters, but she is the one who forms this specific, permanent bond with Adam.\n*   **Plot significance:** This union is not just a romantic subplot; it is central to the novel's exploration of identity, humanity, and post-human evolution.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the character is Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina"
