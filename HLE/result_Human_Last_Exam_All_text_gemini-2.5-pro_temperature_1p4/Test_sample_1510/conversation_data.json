    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Group:** A wallpaper group, or plane crystallographic group, is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. There are a total of 17 distinct wallpaper groups.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, its corresponding point group is the set of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed, when we ignore the translational symmetries. For example, a glide reflection (a reflection followed by a translation) in the wallpaper group corresponds to a simple reflection in its point group.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements in the group.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose associated point group has exactly 2 elements (i.e., order 2).\n\n**2. Identify the Point Groups of Order 2**\n\nIn two dimensions, the possible point groups are restricted by the crystallographic restriction theorem. The allowed point groups are the cyclic groups ($C_n$) and dihedral groups ($D_n$) for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.\n\nLet's find the ones with order 2:\n*   **Cyclic group $C_n$:** The order of $C_n$ is *n*. So, for the order to be 2, we must have **$C_2$**. This group consists of the identity and a 180Â° rotation.\n*   **Dihedral group $D_n$:** The order of $D_n$ is *2n*. For the order to be 2, we must have 2n = 2, which means n = 1. So, we have **$D_1$**. This group consists of the identity and a single reflection. It is often just denoted as *m* (for mirror).\n\nTherefore, we are looking for wallpaper groups whose point group is either $C_2$ or $D_1$ (*m*).\n\n**3. Analyze the 17 Wallpaper Groups**\n\nWe will now go through the 17 wallpaper groups, often categorized by their crystal system, and identify their point groups and the order of those point groups.\n\n**A. Oblique Crystal System**\nThe point groups in this system are $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n1.  **p1:** Has only translational symmetry. Its point group is $C_1$ (trivial group with only the identity element). Order = 1.\n2.  **p2:** Has 2-fold rotational symmetry centers. Its point group is **$C_2$**. **Order = 2**.\n\n**B. Rectangular Crystal System**\nThe point groups in this system are $D_1$ and $D_2$.\n3.  **pm:** Has reflection lines. Its point group is **$D_1$** (or *m*). **Order = 2**.\n4.  **pg:** Has only glide reflection lines. The point group element corresponding to a glide reflection is a simple reflection. So its point group is **$D_1$** (or *m*). **Order = 2**.\n5.  **cm:** Has reflection lines and glide reflection lines with a centered lattice. Its point group is **$D_1$** (or *m*). **Order = 2**.\n6.  **pmm:** Has reflection lines in two perpendicular directions. Its point group is $D_2$. Order = 4.\n7.  **pmg:** Has reflection lines and perpendicular glide reflection lines. Its point group is $D_2$. Order = 4.\n8.  **pgg:** Has glide reflection lines in two perpendicular directions. Its point group is $D_2$. Order = 4.\n9.  **cmm:** Has reflection lines in two perpendicular directions with a centered lattice. Its point group is $D_2$. Order = 4.\n\n**C. Square Crystal System**\nThe point groups in this system are $C_4$ and $D_4$.\n10. **p4:** Has 4-fold rotational symmetry. Its point group is $C_4$. Order = 4.\n11. **p4m:** Has 4-fold rotations and reflections. Its point group is $D_4$. Order = 8.\n12. **p4g:** Has 4-fold rotations and glide reflections. Its point group is $D_4$. Order = 8.\n\n**D. Hexagonal Crystal System**\nThe point groups in this system are $C_3$, $D_3$, $C_6$, and $D_6$.\n13. **p3:** Has 3-fold rotational symmetry. Its point group is $C_3$. Order = 3.\n14. **p3m1:** Has 3-fold rotations and reflections. Its point group is $D_3$. Order = 6.\n15. **p31m:** Has 3-fold rotations and reflections (with a different orientation). Its point group is $D_3$. Order = 6.\n16. **p6:** Has 6-fold rotational symmetry. Its point group is $C_6$. Order = 6.\n17. **p6m:** Has 6-fold rotations and reflections. Its point group is $D_6$. Order = 12.\n\n**4. List and Count the Final Groups**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are:\n1.  **p2** (Point group $C_2$, order 2)\n2.  **pm** (Point group $D_1$, order 2)\n3.  **pg** (Point group $D_1$, order 2)\n4.  **cm** (Point group $D_1$, order 2)\n\nCounting these groups, we find there are 4 in total.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Wallpaper group vs. Point group:** It's crucial not to confuse the wallpaper group (which includes translations) with its associated point group (which does not).\n*   **Glide Reflections:** A key point is that a glide reflection in a wallpaper group becomes a simple reflection in the point group. This is why groups like **pg**, which have no simple reflection lines, still have a point group ($D_1$) that includes a reflection element.\n*   **Systematic Enumeration:** To avoid missing any groups or double-counting, it's best to systematically go through all 17 known wallpaper groups. Categorizing them by crystal system is an effective method.\n*   **Group Orders:** Remember the formulas for the orders of the relevant point groups: order($C_n$) = n and order($D_n$) = 2n.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the total count of the identified groups.\n\n<<<4>>>"
