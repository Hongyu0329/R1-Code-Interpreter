In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is a function of both frequency ($\omega$) and momentum ($k$). Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. Specifically, $\epsilon_k$ appears in the denominator, subtracted from the frequency variable:

$G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - (\epsilon_k - \mu) + i\delta}$

where $\mu$ is the chemical potential and $i\delta$ is an infinitesimal term that enforces causality. Therefore, $\epsilon_k$ determines the location of the pole of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane, which corresponds to the energy of the non-interacting single-particle excitation.
