    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism\n\nThe Green's function, or propagator, describes the propagation of a particle from one spacetime point to another. The \"bare\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a **non-interacting** system.\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism (typically formulated in Euclidean time for calculational convenience), the time-ordered bare Green's function for fermions is given by the expectation value of a product of field operators, calculated as a functional integral over Grassmann fields ($\\psi, \\bar{\\psi}$):\n\n$G_0(x, \\tau; x', \\tau') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x, \\tau) \\bar{\\psi}(x', \\tau') \\, e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\n\nHere, $S_0$ is the action of the non-interacting system.\n\n### Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action and the Role of $\\epsilon_k$\n\nThe action $S_0$ is derived from the non-interacting Hamiltonian, $H_0$. The single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian. In the basis that diagonalizes $H_0$ (e.g., the momentum basis for a translationally invariant system), the Hamiltonian is:\n\n$H_0 = \\sum_k (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_k^\\dagger c_k$\n\nwhere $c_k^\\dagger$ and $c_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a particle in state $k$ with energy $\\epsilon_k$, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n\nThe corresponding Euclidean action $S_0$ is written in terms of the Grassmann fields $\\psi_k(\\tau)$:\n\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\right) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\nHere, $\\tau$ is imaginary time and $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature. The single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$ explicitly appear in the operator acting on the fields within the action.\n\n### Step 3: Transforming to Frequency-Momentum Space\n\nThe calculation is greatly simplified by performing a Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n$. For fermions, the frequencies are $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$.\n\n$\\psi_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\psi_{k,n}$\n\nSubstituting this into the action diagonalizes it, meaning the action becomes a sum over independent modes labeled by $(k, n)$:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_{k,n}$\n\n**Careful Point:** This step is crucial. It shows that in the frequency-momentum representation, the action is quadratic, and the term multiplying the fields is a simple algebraic expression, $(-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu)$, which contains the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of the Green's Function\n\nThe Green's function in the frequency-momentum basis, $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$, is the expectation value $\\langle \\psi_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} \\rangle$. For a quadratic action of the form $S_0 = \\sum \\bar{\\psi} M \\psi$, the Green's function is simply the inverse of the matrix $M$. In our diagonal basis, this is straightforward:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu}$\n\n### Step 5: Final Analysis of the Functional Dependence\n\nTo get the Green's function in real frequency $\\omega$, we perform an analytic continuation by replacing the discrete Matsubara frequency $i\\omega_n$ with the continuous complex variable $z$, and then approaching the real axis, $z \\to \\omega \\pm i\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is a positive infinitesimal. For the retarded Green's function, we use $z \\to \\omega + i\\delta$:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{(\\omega + i\\delta) - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)} = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$\n\nFrom this final expression, we can analyze the functional dependence of $G_0$ on $\\epsilon_k$:\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship:** The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a term containing $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, it takes the form $G_0 \\propto (\\text{Constant} - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, where the constant is the energy of the probe, $\\omega - \\mu$.\n\n2.  **Pole Structure:** The single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$ (shifted by the chemical potential $\\mu$) determines the location of the pole of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane. The pole occurs at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - \\mu - i\\delta$. This means that the particle can propagate indefinitely (infinite response) only when its energy $\\omega$ matches the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ (relative to $\\mu$).\n\n3.  **Locality in k-space:** The Green's function for a given momentum, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, depends *only* on the energy eigenvalue for that same momentum, $\\epsilon_k$. It does not depend on the energies of other states, $\\epsilon_{k'}$ where $k' \\neq k$. This reflects the non-interacting nature of the system, where momentum modes evolve independently.\n\nIn summary, the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ sets the characteristic energy scale for particle propagation in momentum state $k$, appearing in the denominator of the Green's function and defining the location of its simple pole.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is a function of both frequency ($\\omega$) and momentum ($k$). Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. Specifically, $\\epsilon_k$ appears in the denominator, subtracted from the frequency variable:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential and $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal term that enforces causality. Therefore, $\\epsilon_k$ determines the location of the pole of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane, which corresponds to the energy of the non-interacting single-particle excitation.>>>"
