    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question asks for the *most likely mechanism* that explains two phenomena for duplicated genes: 1) **retention** (not being lost from the genome) and 2) **divergence** (evolving to be different from the original copy). The most common fate of a duplicate gene is actually loss (pseudogenization), so we are looking for a specific process that allows it to be kept and change.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Answer Choice A: Gene conversion.**\n    *   **What it is:** Gene conversion is a non-reciprocal process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicated genes, it tends to make the two copies identical or very similar.\n    *   **Does it fit?** No. Gene conversion causes *homogenization*, which is the opposite of *divergence*. It works to prevent the two copies from becoming different. Thus, it is not the mechanism responsible for divergence.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Answer Choice B: Pseudogenization.**\n    *   **What it is:** This is the process where a gene copy accumulates deleterious mutations (e.g., stop codons, frameshifts) that render it non-functional. It becomes a \"pseudogene.\"\n    *   **Does it fit?** No. While this process involves divergence (the sequence changes and loses function), it is the primary mechanism for the *loss* of a functional gene, not its *retention*. The question explicitly asks for a mechanism of *retention*.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Answer Choice C: Neofunctionalization.**\n    *   **What it is:** In this model, after a gene duplicates, one copy maintains the original, essential function, while the other copy is free to accumulate mutations. If one of these mutations results in a new, beneficial function, the new copy will be preserved by natural selection.\n    *   **Does it fit?** Yes. It explains both **retention** (one copy kept for the old function, one for the new) and **divergence** (the second copy evolves a new function). This is a valid and important model.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Answer Choice D: Subfunctionalization.**\n    *   **What it is:** This model, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, applies to ancestral genes that have multiple distinct functions (e.g., expressed in different tissues or having multiple catalytic activities). After duplication, each copy can accumulate mutations that knock out *different* subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function A but keeps B, while copy 2 loses B but keeps A. Now, both copies are required to perform the full set of the original gene's functions.\n    *   **Does it fit?** Yes. It explains both **retention** (both copies become essential to fulfill the original set of tasks) and **divergence** (the genes diverge as they lose different subfunctions and specialize in the remaining ones). This is also a valid and important model.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Answer Choice E: Adaptive radiation.**\n    *   **What it is:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern where a lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species occupying different ecological niches.\n    *   **Does it fit?** No. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material for the evolution that drives adaptive radiation, it is not itself the *molecular mechanism* of gene retention and divergence. It describes a phenomenon at the species level, not the gene level.\n\n7.  **Compare the Valid Choices (C vs. D) to Find the \"Most Likely\".**\n    *   Both neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are correct mechanisms for gene retention and divergence. The question asks for the *most likely* one.\n    *   The primary hurdle for a new duplicate gene is avoiding pseudogenization. For **neofunctionalization** to occur, a rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutation must happen before the gene is silenced by a more common degenerative mutation. This is a low-probability event.\n    *   For **subfunctionalization**, the process relies only on common, degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations occurring in complementary parts of the two genes. Because loss-of-function mutations are much more frequent than gain-of-function mutations, this provides a more probable, passive pathway for both copies to become essential and thus be retained.\n    *   Therefore, subfunctionalization is considered a more likely mechanism, at least for the *initial* retention of duplicate genes, as it provides a path to preservation that does not rely on rare beneficial mutations.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, while both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are valid mechanisms, Subfunctionalization provides a more probable route for a duplicate gene to escape the common fate of pseudogenization and be retained in the genome. It relies on more frequent mutational events (loss-of-function) than the rare gain-of-function events required for neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
