    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between a character and its components.**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters related to the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet the prime factorization of $N$ be $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$. Then any character $\\chi \\pmod N$ can be uniquely written as $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nThe key properties relating $\\chi$ to its components $\\chi_i$ are:\n*   **Conductor:** The conductor of $\\chi$, denoted `cond(χ)`, is the product of the conductors of its components: `cond(χ) = cond(χ₁) cond(χ₂) ... cond(χₖ)`.\n    A character $\\chi$ is **primitive** modulo $N$ if its conductor is exactly $N$. For our problem, this means we must have `cond(χᵢ) = pᵢ^{aᵢ}` for each component `χᵢ`. This is equivalent to saying that each component character `χᵢ` must be a primitive character modulo `pᵢ^{aᵢ}`.\n*   **Order:** The order of $\\chi$, denoted `ord(χ)`, is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: `ord(χ) = lcm(ord(χ₁), ord(χ₂), ..., ord(χₖ))`.\n\n**2. Factorize the conductor N.**\n\nWe are given $N = 36036$.\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nThe prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that `lcm(ord(χ₄), ord(χ₉), ord(χ₇), ord(χ₁₁), ord(χ₁₃)) = 6`.\n\n**3. Determine the possible orders of primitive characters for each component.**\n\nWe need to analyze the group of characters for each prime power factor $p^a$. The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^a\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):**\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$ has $\\phi(4)=2$ elements. There is one primitive character modulo 4. Its order is 2.\n    So, for $\\chi_4$, its order `ord(χ₄)` must be 2. There is **1** such character.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):**\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(9)} = C_6$ is cyclic. A character modulo $p^a$ ($p$ odd, $a \\ge 2$) is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(p^{a-1})$. Here, $p=3, a=2$, so the order must not divide $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    The possible orders for characters mod 9 are divisors of $\\phi(9)=6$, i.e., {1, 2, 3, 6}.\n    For $\\chi_9$ to be primitive, its order cannot be 1 or 2. Thus, `ord(χ₉)` must be in {3, 6}.\n    The number of characters of order $d$ in $C_6$ is $\\phi(d)$.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:**\n    For a prime $p$, a character is primitive if it's not the principal character. The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The possible orders are non-1 divisors of 6, i.e., {2, 3, 6}.\n    - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total choices for primitive $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:**\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. Primitive characters have orders that are non-1 divisors of 10, i.e., {2, 5, 10}.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:**\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. Primitive characters have orders that are non-1 divisors of 12, i.e., {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}.\n\n**4. Count the number of valid tuples.**\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ where the lcm of their orders is 6.\nLet the orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\nThe condition `lcm(...) = 6` implies two things:\n    a) Every order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n    b) The set of orders must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\nLet's check these conditions. From our analysis in Step 3:\n- For $\\chi_4$, the order is fixed: $o_4 = 2$. This automatically satisfies the \"multiple of 2\" part of condition (b).\n- For $\\chi_9$, the order must be 3 or 6. Both are multiples of 3. This automatically satisfies the \"multiple of 3\" part of condition (b).\n\nSince any valid choice of primitive characters for the components mod 4 and mod 9 ensures the lcm of orders is a multiple of `lcm(2, 3) = 6`, the condition `lcm(...) = 6` simplifies. We only need to ensure that the lcm divides 6. This means every individual order $o_i$ must divide 6.\n\nNow, we count the number of choices for each primitive character `χᵢ` such that `ord(χᵢ)` divides 6.\n\n*   **`χ₄` (mod 4):** Order is 2. `2|6`. Number of choices = **1**.\n*   **`χ₉` (mod 9):** Orders are 3 or 6. Both divide 6. Number of choices = $2+2 = **4**$.\n*   **`χ₇` (mod 7):** Orders are 2, 3, or 6. All divide 6. Number of choices = $1+2+2 = **5**$.\n*   **`χ₁₁` (mod 11):** Possible primitive orders are {2, 5, 10}. Only 2 divides 6. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. Number of choices = **1**.\n*   **`χ₁₃` (mod 13):** Possible primitive orders are {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. Those that divide 6 are {2, 3, 6}.\n    - Number of order 2 characters: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of order 3 characters: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of order 6 characters: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total choices: $1+2+2 = **5**$.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number.**\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component.\nTotal number = (Choices for `χ₄`) × (Choices for `χ₉`) × (Choices for `χ₇`) × (Choices for `χ₁₁`) × (Choices for `χ₁₃`)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal number = $100$"
