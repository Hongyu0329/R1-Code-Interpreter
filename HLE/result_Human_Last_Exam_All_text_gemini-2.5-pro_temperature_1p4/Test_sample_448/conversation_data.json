    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the naturally occurring noble gases on Earth.**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The ones that occur naturally on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the basis of comparison.**\nThe question asks for the \"rarest... as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to compare the total abundance of each of these gases in the Earth's system (atmosphere, crust, mantle, oceans). The relative abundances of these elements have not changed significantly on human timescales, so the data from 2002 would be virtually identical to today's accepted values.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the abundances of the stable noble gases.**\nMost of the uncombined noble gases reside in the atmosphere, so atmospheric concentration is an excellent proxy for their overall rarity. Let's look at their typical abundances in dry air by volume:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% or 9,340 parts per million (ppm). It is by far the most abundant noble gas.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~0.0018% or 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** ~0.00052% or 5.2 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~0.00011% or 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.000009% or 0.09 ppm (also written as 90 parts per billion).\n\nBased on this list of stable gases, Xenon (Xe) is the rarest.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the special case of Radon (Rn).**\nRadon is different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive. It has no stable isotopes. Its longest-lived isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element left over from Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously generated by the radioactive decay of radium, which is part of the decay chain of uranium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Abundance:** Because it decays so quickly, the total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any single moment is incredibly small. Its average concentration in the atmosphere is extremely low and highly variable, typically measured on the order of 1 part in 10^21 (sextillion) parts.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude by comparing all candidates.**\nWhen we compare the abundance of all noble gases, including Radon, the ranking is as follows (from most to least abundant):\n1.  Argon (Ar)\n2.  Neon (Ne)\n3.  Helium (He)\n4.  Krypton (Kr)\n5.  Xenon (Xe)\n6.  Radon (Rn)\n\nEven though Xenon is the rarest of the stable noble gases, Radon's extremely short half-life and transient nature make its equilibrium quantity many, many orders of magnitude smaller.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Stable vs. Radioactive:** The key distinction is between the stable (or very long-lived) noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and the radioactive noble gas (Rn).\n*   **Definition of Abundance:** Abundance for a radioactive element like Radon refers to its steady-state or equilibrium amount, which is the balance between its rate of creation and its rate of decay. This amount is minuscule.\n*   **Irrelevance of the year 2002:** The fundamental properties and relative abundances of these elements were well-established by 2002 and have not changed. Radon was known to be the rarest noble gas then, just as it is today.\n*   **Terrestrial Matter vs. Atmosphere:** While we use atmospheric concentrations for easy comparison, the conclusion holds for all terrestrial matter. The total amount of Radon in the crust, oceans, and atmosphere combined is still vastly less than the total amount of Xenon.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, Radon's continuous and rapid decay ensures that it is present in far smaller quantities at any given moment than any other noble gas. Therefore, it is the rarest.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
