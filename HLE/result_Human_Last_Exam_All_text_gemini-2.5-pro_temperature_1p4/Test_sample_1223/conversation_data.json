    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Question and Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the terms used in the question.\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable (HI) Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a classic example.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that $K$ has a proper subcontinuum containing both $p$ and $q$. An indecomposable continuum is a disjoint union of its composants.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification ($\\beta Y$):** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, $\\beta Y$ is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder ($Y^*$):** The remainder is the set of points in the compactification that are not in the original space, i.e., $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n*   **The space under consideration:** $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x \\in X$.\n*   **The object of study:** The set of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder, $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. We need to find the maximum possible size of this set.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points and Relevant Theorems\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to establish the topological properties of the remainder $Y^*$. Several key theorems are relevant.\n\n1.  **The nature of the remainder:** The remainder $Y^*$ is a compact Hausdorff space by definition. We need to determine if it is connected, and if it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n2.  **The effect of puncturing a continuum:** The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a non-compact, locally compact, and sigma-compact space. Since $X$ is a non-degenerate continuum, $Y$ is connected.\n3.  **Bellamy's Theorem:** A crucial theorem by David P. Bellamy (1971) states that for any non-degenerate continuum $K$ and any point $p \\in K$, the Stone-Cech remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is a non-degenerate, indecomposable continuum.\n4.  **Hereditary indecomposability of the remainder:** A more specific result by Jan van Mill (1982) shows that if $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, then the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is also hereditary indecomposable.\n5.  **Number of composants:** A fundamental theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz states that any non-degenerate, separable, indecomposable continuum has exactly $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's apply these theorems to our problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the space and its remainder.**\n    We are given $X$, a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, and a point $x \\in X$. We are interested in the number of composants of the remainder $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. Since $X$ is hereditary indecomposable, it must be non-degenerate (i.e., not a single point).\n\n2.  **Establish the properties of the remainder $Y^*$.**\n    *   **$Y^*$ is a non-degenerate continuum:** Bellamy's theorem applies directly to our space $X$. Since $X$ is a non-degenerate continuum, the remainder $Y^*$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum. \"Non-degenerate\" means it is not a single point. This is also clear because $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not pseudocompact (the function $f(z) = 1/d(z,x)$ is continuous and unbounded on $Y$), which implies its remainder must have more than one point.\n    *   **$Y^*$ is indecomposable:** As stated by Bellamy's theorem, $Y^*$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   **$Y^*$ is hereditary indecomposable:** Van Mill's theorem gives us this even stronger property, since the original space $X$ is hereditary indecomposable. This confirms and reinforces the indecomposability of $Y^*$.\n    *   **$Y^*$ is separable:** The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a metric space, so it is separable. It is also locally compact and can be written as a countable union of compact sets (e.g., $Y = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\{z \\in X \\mid d(z,x) \\ge 1/n\\}$), making it sigma-compact. For any locally compact, sigma-compact, separable space, its Stone-Cech remainder is a compact, separable Hausdorff space. Therefore, $Y^*$ is separable.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of composants of $Y^*$.**\n    We have concluded that $Y^*$ is a **non-degenerate, indecomposable, separable continuum**. We now use Mazurkiewicz's theorem, which states that any continuum with these properties has exactly $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\n4.  **Find the maximum possible number.**\n    Our analysis shows that for any hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the number of composants of the remainder is always $c$. This is a constant value. Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is $c$. For example, if $X$ is the pseudo-arc, the remainder is also a pseudo-arc, which is known to have $c$ composants.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is determined by the topological properties of the remainder itself. The properties of $X$ guarantee that the remainder is a non-degenerate, separable, indecomposable continuum. According to classical continuum theory, such a space must have exactly $c$ composants. Thus, the maximum possible number is $c$.\n\n$c$ (the cardinality of the continuum)"
