    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Tensor and the Space**\n\nThe function is given by $F(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$.\nThis function is viewed as a 3-tensor in the space $W \\otimes W \\otimes W$, where $W = V^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of complex-valued functions on $\\{0, 1\\}^n$. The dimension of the underlying vector space for each \"mode\" ($x, y, z$) is $2^n$.\n\nThe tensor $F$ can be written as the difference of two tensors: $F = T - \\mathbf{1}$, where\n*   $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$\n*   $\\mathbf{1}(x, y, z) = 1$ is the constant function.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Slice Rank of F to the Slice Rank of T**\n\nThe slice rank, denoted by SR, is sub-additive. This means $SR(A+B) \\le SR(A) + SR(B)$.\nFrom this, we have:\n$SR(F) = SR(T - \\mathbf{1}) \\le SR(T) + SR(\\mathbf{1})$.\nAnd also $SR(T) = SR(F + \\mathbf{1}) \\le SR(F) + SR(\\mathbf{1})$.\n\nThe tensor $\\mathbf{1}$ is the constant function which is 1 everywhere. It can be written as a slice, for example, a 1-slice: $\\mathbf{1}(x, y, z) = u(x) A(y, z)$, where $u(x)$ is the constant function 1 on $\\{0,1\\}^n$ and $A(y, z)$ is the constant function 1 on $\\{0,1\\}^n \\times \\{0,1\\}^n$. Thus, the slice rank of $\\mathbf{1}$ is $SR(\\mathbf{1}) = 1$.\n\nSo, we have $SR(T) - 1 \\le SR(F) \\le SR(T) + 1$.\nFor large $n$, the slice rank $SR(F)$ is asymptotically equal to $SR(T)$. The given expression $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$ describes the dominant exponential growth, so we can determine it from the slice rank of $T$.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the Tensor T**\n\nThe tensor $T$ has a natural tensor product structure. Let $f_i(x_i, y_i, z_i) = x_i + y_i + z_i$. This is a function on $\\{0, 1\\} \\times \\{0, 1\\} \\times \\{0, 1\\}$, which can be seen as a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor in $V \\otimes V \\otimes V$, where $V$ is the space of functions from $\\{0,1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$.\nThe tensor $T$ is the $n$-th tensor power of the base tensor $f_1$:\n$T = \\bigotimes_{i=1}^n f_i = f_1 \\otimes f_2 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes f_n$.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Multiplicativity of Slice Rank**\n\nA key property of slice rank is that it is multiplicative with respect to the tensor product. For tensors $A$ and $B$, $SR(A \\otimes B) = SR(A) \\cdot SR(B)$.\nApplying this property repeatedly, we get:\n$SR(T) = SR(\\bigotimes_{i=1}^n f_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^n SR(f_i)$.\nSince all $f_i$ are identical functions (just on different variables), their slice ranks are the same. Let $s = SR(f_1)$.\nThen $SR(T) = s^n$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Slice Rank of the Base Tensor f1**\n\nWe need to find the slice rank of $f_1(x, y, z) = x + y + z$ where $x,y,z \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This is a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor over $\\mathbb{C}$. The slice rank of a 3-tensor is the minimum of its \"flattening ranks\" (also called directional ranks).\nThe rank in direction 1, denoted $\\text{rank}_1(f_1)$, is the dimension of the vector space spanned by the matrix slices obtained by fixing the first variable, $x$.\n*   For $x=0$, the slice is the function (matrix) $M_0(y,z) = 0+y+z = y+z$. The matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   For $x=1$, the slice is the function (matrix) $M_1(y,z) = 1+y+z = 1+y+z$. The matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe functions $M_0(y,z)$ and $M_1(y,z)$ are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{C}$, because one is not a scalar multiple of the other. (Their difference is the non-zero constant function 1). Thus, the dimension of the space spanned by these two slices is 2.\nSo, $\\text{rank}_1(f_1) = 2$.\n\nBy the symmetry of the function $f_1(x, y, z) = x+y+z$, the ranks in directions 2 and 3 are also 2:\n$\\text{rank}_2(f_1) = 2$\n$\\text{rank}_3(f_1) = 2$\n\nThe slice rank is the minimum of these ranks:\n$s = SR(f_1) = \\min(\\text{rank}_1(f_1), \\text{rank}_2(f_1), \\text{rank}_3(f_1)) = \\min(2, 2, 2) = 2$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Asymptotic Slice Rank**\n\nFrom the previous steps, we have:\n$SR(T) = (SR(f_1))^n = 2^n$.\nSince $SR(F) \\sim SR(T)$, the asymptotic behavior of $SR(F)$ is $2^n$.\n\n**Step 7: Solve for K**\n\nWe are given that the slice rank of $F$ is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. We equate this with our derived asymptotic rank $2^n$. The $e^{o(n)}$ term represents sub-exponential factors, which do not affect the base of the exponential growth.\nSo, we set the bases equal:\n$2 = \\frac{3}{2^K}$\n\nNow, we solve for $K$:\n$2 \\cdot 2^K = 3$\n$2^{K+1} = 3$\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n$K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log_b(m) - \\log_b(n) = \\log_b(m/n)$:\n$K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$"
