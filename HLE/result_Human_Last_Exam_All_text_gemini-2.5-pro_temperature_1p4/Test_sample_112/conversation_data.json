    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the source of the story \"Sir Launfal\".**\nThe question refers to \"Sir Launfal,\" a 14th-century Middle English romance poem written by Thomas Chestre. It's crucial to understand that medieval works like this were preserved not as individual printed books but as handwritten texts collected in manuscripts, often alongside other, sometimes unrelated, works.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the specific manuscript where \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved.**\nThomas Chestre's poem *Sir Launfal* survives in only one manuscript. This manuscript is famously known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, which is now held in the British Library. To answer the question, we must analyze the other contents of this specific manuscript.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the contents of the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript.**\nThis manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it contains a diverse collection of texts. Scholars have studied its contents extensively. Besides *Sir Launfal*, it contains other famous Middle English works such as *La»ùamon's Brut*, *The Owl and the Nightingale*, and *Sir Orfeo*.\n\n**Step 4: Search for a \"book of manners\" within the manuscript's contents.**\nLooking at the list of works compiled in Cotton Caligula A.ii, we find a text specifically dedicated to etiquette and proper conduct. This text is known as ***The Book of Curtesye*** (or *The Book of Courtesy*). This work is a clear example of a medieval \"book of manners,\" providing instruction on courtly behavior, table manners, and general social etiquette for young men.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to form a conclusion.**\nThe poem *Sir Launfal* is preserved in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript. Within this same manuscript collection, there is also a text titled *The Book of Curtesye*. Therefore, *Sir Launfal* was preserved alongside this specific book of manners.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Manuscript Context:** The core of the question relies on understanding that medieval literature was compiled in manuscript codices, not published as individual books. The \"alongside\" refers to co-existence within the same physical manuscript.\n*   **Specificity:** It's important to identify the specific title of the book of manners, not just describe its function.\n*   **Distinguishing Versions:** The question is about the Middle English *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre, not the earlier Old French *Lanval* by Marie de France, which is preserved in different manuscripts. The answer is specific to Chestre's version and its unique manuscript witness.\n\n***The Book of Curtesye***"
