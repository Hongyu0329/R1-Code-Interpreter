    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X**\nLet $X$ be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\nA lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. It can be given by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, where $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$. Let $A$ be the $2 \\times 2$ matrix whose columns are $v_1, v_2$. $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of unit area means we restrict to matrices $A$ with $|\\det(A)|=1$. Let this set of matrices be $G = \\{ A \\in GL(2,\\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(A)|=1 \\}$.\nTwo bases $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $\\{w_1, w_2\\}$ generate the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix from $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. That is, if $A$ and $B$ are the corresponding matrices, then $B=Ag$ for some $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nTherefore, the space $X$ is the quotient space $X = G / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThis is the space of lattices as subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The term \"moduli space\" here does not imply quotienting by rotations ($O(2)$), which would correspond to isometry classes of lattices.\n\n**Step 2: Relate X to a known space Y**\nLet $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This is the moduli space of *oriented* lattices of unit area. A point in $Y$ is given by a basis with determinant +1.\nThe space $Y$ is a well-studied 3-manifold. It is known to be homeomorphic to the complement of the right-handed trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $Y \\cong S^3 \\setminus K$.\nThe first homology group of a knot complement is well-known. For any knot $K \\subset S^3$, $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by a meridian loop around the knot.\nThus, $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 3: Express X as a quotient of Y**\nThere is a map $p: Y \\to X$ which \"forgets\" the orientation. A lattice $\\Lambda$ corresponds to a point in $X$. It has two orientations, $(\\Lambda,+)$ and $(\\Lambda,-)$, which correspond to two points in $Y$ (unless the lattice possesses an orientation-reversing symmetry). So $p$ is generically a 2-to-1 map.\n$X$ can be described as the quotient of $Y$ by an involution $\\tau$ that swaps the orientation.\nLet's define this involution $\\tau$ on $Y$. A point in $Y$ is a coset $[A] = A \\cdot SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ for $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. An orientation-reversing linear map is given by reflection, for example $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has determinant -1.\nThe involution on $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is given by conjugation by $S$, i.e., $A \\mapsto SAS^{-1}$. This induces a well-defined involution $\\tau$ on $Y=SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\tau([A])=[SAS^{-1}]$. The quotient space $Y/\\tau$ is homeomorphic to $X$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the action of the involution on the homology of Y**\nWe need to know how the involution $\\tau$ acts on $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$. The map $\\tau$ corresponds to the geometric action $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$ on the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ (which is the space of lattices up to rotation). This action reverses the orientation of $\\mathbb{H}$. The generator of $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ can be identified with the class of a fiber in the Seifert fibration of $Y$ over the modular orbifold $\\mathbb{H}/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. This class is sensitive to orientation, and it is a standard result that this involution acts by multiplication by $-1$ on $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nSo, $\\tau_*: H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the map $k \\mapsto -k$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the homology of the quotient space X**\nSince $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Q})=0$, $H_1(X,\\mathbb{Z})$ must be pure torsion. Let's consider the transfer sequence for the double cover $p:Y \\to X$. We have $p_* \\circ tr = 2 \\cdot \\text{id}_X$ and $tr \\circ p_* = \\text{id}_Y + \\tau_*$. Applying this to $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$:\n$tr \\circ p_*: H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the map $k \\mapsto k + (-k) = 0$.\nThis does not determine $H_1(X)$ completely, but another argument shows $2H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Consider the transfer map $tr: H_1(X) \\to H_1(Y)$. Its image must be contained in the subgroup of $H_1(Y)$ fixed by $\\tau_*$, because for any $x \\in H_1(X)$, $\\tau_*(tr(x))=tr(x)$. The subgroup fixed by $\\tau_*$ (multiplication by -1) is $\\{k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid k = -k\\} = \\{0\\}$. So the transfer map $tr: H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the zero map.\nSince $p_* \\circ tr = 2 \\cdot \\text{id}_X$, we have $2 \\cdot H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = p_*(tr(H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}))) = p_*(0) = 0$.\nThis proves that every element in $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ has order dividing 2. Thus $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nTo find $k$, we use the Smith exact sequence for a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-action, with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients. Let $F = Y^\\tau$ be the fixed-point set of the involution. It is known that $F$ consists of two disjoint circles, $F \\cong S^1 \\sqcup S^1$.\nThe sequence is:\n$H_1(F, \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\xrightarrow{\\beta} H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\xrightarrow{\\delta} H_0(F, \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\xrightarrow{\\gamma} H_0(Y, \\mathbb{Z}_2)$\nLet's determine the groups and maps:\n- $F = S^1 \\sqcup S^1 \\implies H_1(F, \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$, $H_0(F, \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n- $Y$ is connected $\\implies H_0(Y, \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n- $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\implies H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n- The map $\\gamma$ is induced by inclusion and maps $(a,b) \\in H_0(F)$ to $a+b \\in H_0(Y)$. So $\\gamma(a,b)=a+b$. Its kernel is $\\ker(\\gamma)=\\{(0,0), (1,1)\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. By exactness, the image of $\\delta$ is isomorphic to $\\ker(\\gamma)$, so $\\dim(\\text{im}(\\delta))=1$.\n- The map $\\alpha$ is induced by the inclusion $F \\hookrightarrow Y$. It is a known (but non-trivial) fact that the two circles of $F$ represent the homology classes $0$ and $2m$ in $H_1(Y,\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}m$. Over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, $2m$ becomes $0$. Thus the map $\\alpha: \\mathbb{Z}_2^2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the zero map.\n- By exactness, the map $\\beta: H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ has kernel $\\text{im}(\\alpha)=\\{0\\}$, so $\\beta$ is injective. Therefore, $\\dim(\\text{im}(\\beta)) = \\dim(H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}_2)) = 1$.\n- From the exact sequence, we have an isomorphism $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}_2) / \\text{im}(\\beta) \\cong \\text{im}(\\delta)$.\n- Thus, $\\dim(H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}_2)) = \\dim(\\text{im}(\\beta)) + \\dim(\\text{im}(\\delta)) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nSo $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nSince we already established $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$, comparing dimensions gives $k=2$.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe first homology group is $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$."
