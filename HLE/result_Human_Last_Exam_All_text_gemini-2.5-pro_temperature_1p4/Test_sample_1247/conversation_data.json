    "Answering this question requires finding the number of permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions that avoid the pattern 1324. The notation for this quantity is \\(av_{n}^k(1324)\\).\n\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}\\).\n- An **inversion** is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\). The number of inversions is denoted by \\(inv(\\pi)\\).\n- A permutation \\(\\pi\\) **avoids the pattern 1324** if there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\).\n\nWe are looking for \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\). Since \\(n=333\\) is a large number, the result is expected to be independent of \\(n\\) for \\(n\\) greater than some small integer (e.g., \\(n \\ge 6\\)). The structure of such permutations must be \"local\" to avoid forming a 1324 pattern. This means the elements causing the inversions must be close to each other or located at the ends of the permutation.\n\nLet's classify permutations with 3 inversions and test them for the 1324 pattern. A permutation with a small number of inversions can be thought of as a small \"disturbance\" of the identity permutation \\((1, 2, \\dots, n)\\).\n\nA key insight is that if the disturbance is not at one of the ends of the permutation, it is very likely to form a 1324 pattern. For example, the permutation \\(\\pi = (1, 4, 2, 3, 5, \\dots, n)\\) has 2 inversions. It contains the 1324 pattern for \\(n \\ge 5\\) with indices \\(i=1, j=2, k=4, l=5\\), since \\(\\pi_1=1, \\pi_2=4, \\pi_4=3, \\pi_5=5\\) and \\(1 < 3 < 4 < 5\\). More generally, any permutation containing non-overlapping inversions that are not at the permutation's ends will likely contain a 1324 pattern.\n\nWe analyze the permutations based on their structure:\n1.  **Indecomposable permutations**: The disturbance is a single block, meaning the permutation is of the form \\(\\sigma \\oplus id_{n-m}\\) or \\(id_{n-m} \\oplus \\sigma\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is an indecomposable permutation of length \\(m\\), \\(id_k\\) is the identity permutation of length \\(k\\), and \\(\\oplus\\) denotes direct sum. For the number of inversions to be small, \\(m\\) must be small.\n    - Let \\(\\sigma\\) be a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\). To have 3 inversions, \\(\\sigma\\) must be \\((3, 2, 1)\\).\n        -   \\(\\pi_1 = (3, 2, 1, 4, 5, \\dots, n)\\). This has 3 inversions and avoids 1324 for any \\(n\\).\n        -   The suffix version is \\(\\pi_2 = (1, 2, \\dots, n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\). This also has 3 inversions and avoids 1324. These two are related by reversal and complementation (\\(rc\\)-duals) and form a pair of valid permutations.\n    - Let \\(\\sigma\\) be a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\). We need \\(inv(\\sigma) = 3\\). The permutations of \\(S_4\\) with 3 inversions are \\((4,1,2,3)\\), \\((3,2,1,4)\\), \\((2,3,4,1)\\), \\((1,4,3,2)\\), \\((3,1,4,2)\\), \\((2,4,1,3)\\).\n        We test these as prefixes for large \\(n\\). For example \\(\\pi = (1,4,3,2,5, \\dots)\\). This has a 1324 pattern: take indices \\(i=1,j=2,k=3,l=5\\); \\(\\pi_1=1, \\pi_2=4, \\pi_3=3, \\pi_5=5\\). We check \\(\\pi_1 < \\pi_3 < \\pi_2 < \\pi_5 \\Rightarrow 1 < 3 < 4 < 5\\). This is true.\n        A careful analysis shows that only the following prefixes (and their suffix duals) avoid 1324 for large \\(n\\):\n        -   \\(\\pi_3 = (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots, n)\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n        -   Its \\(rc\\)-dual is \\(\\pi_4 = (1, \\dots, n-4, n-2, n-1, n, n-3)\\) which has \\(k=3\\). Oh wait, its rc-dual is \\((2,3,4,1)\\) as prefix. Let's check \\(\\pi_4=(2,3,4,1,5,...,n)\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n    So we have two more permutations. So far, we have found 4 such permutations.\n\n2.  **Decomposable permutations**: The permutation can be written as a direct sum of two smaller permutations, \\(\\pi = \\sigma_1 \\oplus \\sigma_2\\). A permutation is decomposable if there exists \\(m \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}\\) such that \\(\\pi(\\{1, \\dots, m\\}) = \\{1, \\dots, m\\}\\). The number of inversions is \\(inv(\\pi) = inv(\\sigma_1) + inv(\\sigma_2)\\). If both \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) are 1324-avoiding, then so is \\(\\pi\\).\n    We need to find pairs of permutations \\(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2\\) such that \\(inv(\\sigma_1) + inv(\\sigma_2) = 3\\).\n    - \\(inv(\\sigma_1)=1, inv(\\sigma_2)=2\\).\n        - Smallest \\(\\sigma_1\\) with 1 inversion: \\((2,1)\\) (size 2).\n        - Smallest \\(\\sigma_2\\) with 2 inversions: \\((2,3,1)\\) and \\((3,1,2)\\) (size 3).\n        - \\(\\pi_5 = (2,1) \\oplus (2,3,1) = (2,1,4,5,3)\\). This has \\(1+2=3\\) inversions and is 1324-avoiding.\n        - \\(\\pi_6 = (2,1) \\oplus (3,1,2) = (2,1,5,3,4)\\). This has \\(1+2=3\\) inversions and is 1324-avoiding.\n    - \\(inv(\\sigma_1)=2, inv(\\sigma_2)=1\\).\n        - \\(\\sigma_1\\) can be \\((2,3,1)\\) or \\((3,1,2)\\). \\(\\sigma_2\\) can be \\((2,1)\\).\n        - \\(\\pi_7 = (2,3,1) \\oplus (2,1) = (2,3,1,5,4)\\). This is the \\(rc\\)-dual of \\(\\pi_6\\). Avoider.\n        - \\(\\pi_8 = (3,1,2) \\oplus (2,1) = (3,1,2,5,4)\\). This is the \\(rc\\)-dual of \\(\\pi_5\\). Avoider.\n    This gives 4 decomposable permutations.\n\nIn total, for large \\(n\\), we have found:\n- 2 indecomposable permutations from \\(\\sigma=(3,2,1)\\) (prefix and suffix versions).\n- 2 indecomposable permutations from \\(\\sigma=(4,1,2,3)\\) and its dual \\(\\sigma'=(2,3,4,1)\\) (prefix versions, the suffix versions are these again).\n- 4 decomposable permutations from combinations of \\(k=1\\) and \\(k=2\\) permutations.\n\nLet's list them:\n1.  \\((3,2,1,4,5,\\dots)\\)\n2.  \\((1,2,\\dots,n-3,n,n-1,n-2)\\)\n3.  \\((4,1,2,3,5,\\dots)\\)\n4.  \\((2,3,4,1,5,\\dots)\\)\n5.  \\((2,1,4,5,3,\\dots)\\)\n6.  \\((2,1,5,3,4,\\dots)\\)\n7.  \\((2,3,1,5,4,\\dots)\\)\n8.  \\((3,1,2,5,4,\\dots)\\)\n\nThese are 8 distinct permutations. Other combinations of permutations or more complex structures tend to introduce a 1324 pattern for large \\(n\\). Therefore, the number of such permutations stabilizes for \\(n\\) large enough (here \\(n \\ge 6\\)).\n\nThe final count is 8."
