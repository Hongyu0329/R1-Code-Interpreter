    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a separable differential equation because we can group all terms involving $x$ and $dx$ on one side of the equation, and all terms involving $t$ and $dt$ on the other side.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\nTo separate the variables, we divide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply both sides by $dt$. A careful point here is to note that this is valid only if $x^2 \\neq 0$, i.e., $x \\neq 0$. The initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is non-zero, so we are not near the constant solution $x(t)=0$. Thus, the division is valid.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   The left-hand side: $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   The right-hand side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nAfter integrating, we must add a constant of integration, which we will call $C$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\nThe initial condition is given as $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our integrated equation to solve for $C$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\nA careful point here is handling the signs correctly.\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n**5. Write the particular solution**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Solve for x(t) and find x(1)**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can substitute $t=1$ directly into the equation above and then solve for $x$.\nLet's set $t=1$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo combine the fractions on the right-hand side, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nNow, we can solve for $x(1)$. Multiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives the final answer:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  **Separation:** $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$.\n2.  **Integration:** $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$.\n3.  **Applying Initial Condition $x(0)=-8$:** $-\\frac{1}{-8} = 0 - 0 + C \\implies C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n4.  **Particular Solution:** $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$.\n5.  **Evaluate at $t=1$:** $-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4-8+1}{8} = -\\frac{3}{8}$.\n6.  **Solve for $x(1)$:** $\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} \\implies x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
