    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core task**\nThe primary goal is to compute the determinant of the matrix \\(A\\) provided in the question.\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the provided context**\nThe question mentions \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n*   **Markov Quiver:** This term refers to a specific type of quiver (a directed graph) related to the Markov equation \\(x^2+y^2+z^2 = 3xyz\\). The matrix \\(A\\) is the Cartan matrix associated with the affine Lie algebra \\(\\tilde{A}_2\\), which corresponds to this quiver type. While this context explains the origin of the matrix, the matrix itself is explicitly given.\n*   **\\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\):** This piece of information seems to be extraneous detail. The number 13 is a Markov number, but since the matrix \\(A\\) is given with constant entries, this value does not affect the calculation.\n*   **\"Adjacency matrix\":** While in graph theory this term usually implies a matrix of 0s and 1s, in this context from mathematical physics and algebra, it is used to refer to the matrix \\(A\\) (the Cartan matrix).\n\nThe crucial point is that we don't need to derive the matrix from this information; we just need to compute the determinant of the matrix \\(A\\) as it is written.\n\n**Step 3: Look for properties of the matrix \\(A\\)**\nBefore starting a full determinant calculation, it's wise to inspect the matrix for any special properties that might simplify the process.\nLet's examine the sum of the row vectors:\n*   Row 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Row 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Row 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n\nWe can also check the sum of the column vectors:\n*   Column 1 + Column 2 + Column 3 = \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2-1-1 \\\\ -1+2-1 \\\\ -1-1+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nSince the sum of the column vectors is the zero vector, the columns are linearly dependent. A fundamental property of determinants is that if the columns (or rows) of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. This gives us the answer without any further calculation.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the result with a direct calculation (optional but recommended)**\nTo be certain, we can compute the determinant using a standard formula, like Sarrus's rule for 3x3 matrices.\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix}\\) is \\( (aei + bfg + cdh) - (gec + hfa + idb) \\).\n\nFor our matrix \\(A\\):\n*   \\(a=2, b=-1, c=-1\\)\n*   \\(d=-1, e=2, f=-1\\)\n*   \\(g=-1, h=-1, i=2\\)\n\nCalculate the sum of the products of the forward diagonals:\n\\( (2)(2)(2) + (-1)(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(-1) = 8 - 1 - 1 = 6 \\)\n\nCalculate the sum of the products of the backward diagonals:\n\\( (-1)(2)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(2) + (2)(-1)(-1) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\)\n\nThe determinant is the difference between these two sums:\n\\( \\det(A) = 6 - 6 = 0 \\)\n\nThis confirms the result obtained from observing the linear dependence of the columns.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBoth the analysis of the matrix properties and the direct calculation show that the determinant of the matrix \\(A\\) is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
