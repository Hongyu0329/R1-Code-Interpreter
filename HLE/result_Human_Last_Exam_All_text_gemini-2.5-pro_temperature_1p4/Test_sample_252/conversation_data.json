    "Answering this question requires understanding the principles of a specific imaging technique called Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). This technique aims to capture a 3D data cube (two spatial dimensions, x and y, and one spectral dimension, 位) from a single 2D snapshot image.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The goal is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\". A spectral volume, also known as a hyperspectral data cube, has information for every spatial point (x, y) across a range of wavelengths (位). The constraint is that all this information must be captured in one go, on a single 2D sensor.\n\n2.  **Relate to Computed Tomography (CT):** Standard CT reconstructs a 2D or 3D object from multiple projections taken at different angles. The core principle is that you need multiple different \"views\" of an object to reconstruct its internal structure. The Radon transform mathematically describes this process.\n\n3.  **The \"Single Image\" Paradox:** How can we get multiple \"views\" or \"projections\" from a single image? This is the central challenge that CTIS solves. The \"projections\" are not created by physically moving a camera or the object. Instead, they are created optically and multiplexed (overlapped) onto a single sensor.\n\n4.  **The Role of the Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical element that splits light into its constituent wavelengths. A single point of light passing through a grating is spread out into a spectrum.\n    *   A **1D grating** disperses light along a single axis. For example, it might spread the spectrum of a point source into a horizontal line of colored dots on the sensor.\n    *   A **2D grating** (also known as a crossed grating) disperses light along two perpendicular axes. It's functionally equivalent to two 1D gratings placed back-to-back at a 90-degree angle to each other. It spreads the spectrum of a point source into a 2D grid of colored dots.\n\n5.  **Generating the \"Projections\" for Tomography:**\n    *   In CTIS, the scene is imaged through a disperser (the grating) onto the 2D sensor.\n    *   The different diffraction orders produced by the grating act as the different \"projections\" needed for tomographic reconstruction. The zeroth-order diffraction is an undispersed, panchromatic image. The first-order diffractions (+1, -1) are images where each point is shifted by an amount proportional to its wavelength, and so on for higher orders.\n    *   Each diffraction order is a unique, distorted \"view\" of the original (x, y, 位) data cube. The algorithm then uses these multiple, overlapping views captured on the single sensor to tomographically reconstruct the original data cube.\n\n6.  **Determining the Minimum Number of Gratings:**\n    *   **Using 1 Grating:** If we use only a single 1D grating, all the diffraction orders (and thus all our \"projections\") lie along a single line. In tomographic terms, this means we have only sampled the object's frequency space along one line. This leads to the classic \"missing cone\" or \"missing wedge\" problem. It's impossible to uniquely and fully reconstruct the 2D spatial information because variations along the dispersion direction are ambiguously mixed with spectral variations. Therefore, one grating is insufficient.\n    *   **Using 2 Gratings:** If we use two 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly (or a single 2D crossed grating, which is functionally the same), we generate a 2D pattern of diffraction orders. For example, we get orders (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (1,1), etc. These orders represent projections from different, non-collinear directions. We have a projection along the x-axis, another along the y-axis, and others along diagonals. This set of projections provides enough information to sample the object's frequency space more completely, allowing for a stable tomographic reconstruction of the `(x, y, 位)` data cube.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Functionality vs. Physical Component:** The question asks for the number of \"gratings\". A single physical component called a \"2D crossed grating\" performs the function of two perpendicular 1D gratings. The minimum *functional* requirement is for two non-parallel dispersion axes, which is achieved by two gratings.\n*   **The Analogy to CT:** The \"projections\" in CTIS are not physical rotations but are different diffraction orders, each representing a sheared version of the original data cube. The reconstruction algorithm is mathematically analogous to CT.\n*   **Minimum vs. Optimal:** While two gratings are the *minimum* necessary for reconstruction, using more gratings (e.g., three gratings oriented at 0, 60, and 120 degrees) or more complex diffractive optical elements can provide more projections and improve the quality of the reconstruction. However, the question asks for the *minimum*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo overcome the \"missing cone\" problem inherent in using a single dispersion axis, at least two non-parallel dispersion axes are required. This is achieved by using two perpendicular diffraction gratings. This provides a set of 2D projections sufficient for the tomographic algorithm to reconstruct the 3D spectral data cube.\n\n<<<B>>>"
