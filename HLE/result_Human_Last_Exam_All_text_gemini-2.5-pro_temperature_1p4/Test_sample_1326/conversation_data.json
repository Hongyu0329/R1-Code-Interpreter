    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks for the definite integral of a piecewise function `p(x)` from `x = 0` to `x = 4`.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n1.  `p(x) = (2x^3) / 8 = x^3 / 4` for `0 ≤ x ≤ 3`\n2.  `p(x) = e^x(1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x)` for `3 ≤ x ≤ 5`\n\nThe integration interval `[0, 4]` covers parts of both definitions. Therefore, we must split the integral at the boundary point `x = 3`.\n\n`∫[0 to 4] p(x) dx = ∫[0 to 3] p(x) dx + ∫[3 to 4] p(x) dx`\n\n**Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3**\n\nFor this interval, `p(x) = x^3 / 4`.\n\n1.  **Set up the integral:**\n    `∫[0 to 3] (x^3 / 4) dx`\n\n2.  **Find the antiderivative:**\n    The antiderivative of `x^3 / 4` is `(1/4) * (x^4 / 4) = x^4 / 16`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:**\n    `[x^4 / 16]_0^3 = (3^4 / 16) - (0^4 / 16)`\n    `= 81 / 16 - 0`\n    `= 81 / 16 = 5.0625`\n\n**Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4**\n\nFor this interval, `p(x) = e^x(1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x)`.\n\n1.  **Set up the integral:**\n    `∫[3 to 4] e^x * ((1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x)) dx`\n\n2.  **Careful Point: Simplify the trigonometric expression.** This integral has a special form `∫ e^x(f(x) + f'(x)) dx = e^x f(x) + C`. Let's simplify the fraction to see if it fits this pattern.\n    We use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n    *   `sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)`\n    *   `1 + cos x = 2 cos^2(x/2)`\n\n    Substitute these into the fraction:\n    `(1 + sin x) / (1 + cos x) = (1 + 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)) / (2 cos^2(x/2))`\n\n    Split the fraction into two terms:\n    `= 1 / (2 cos^2(x/2)) + (2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)) / (2 cos^2(x/2))`\n    `= (1/2) sec^2(x/2) + sin(x/2) / cos(x/2)`\n    `= tan(x/2) + (1/2)sec^2(x/2)`\n\n3.  **Identify f(x) and f'(x):**\n    The integral is now `∫[3 to 4] e^x * (tan(x/2) + (1/2)sec^2(x/2)) dx`.\n    Let `f(x) = tan(x/2)`.\n    Then, its derivative `f'(x)` is `d/dx(tan(x/2)) = sec^2(x/2) * d/dx(x/2) = (1/2)sec^2(x/2)`.\n    Our integral is exactly in the form `∫ e^x (f(x) + f'(x)) dx`.\n\n4.  **Find the antiderivative:**\n    The antiderivative is `e^x * f(x) = e^x * tan(x/2)`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the definite integral:**\n    `[e^x * tan(x/2)]_3^4 = (e^4 * tan(4/2)) - (e^3 * tan(3/2))`\n    `= e^4 * tan(2) - e^3 * tan(1.5)`\n\n    (Note: The angles `2` and `1.5` are in radians.)\n\n6.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    *   `e^4 ≈ 54.598`\n    *   `e^3 ≈ 20.086`\n    *   `tan(2) ≈ -2.185`\n    *   `tan(1.5) ≈ 14.101`\n\n    Value = `(54.598 * -2.185) - (20.086 * 14.101)`\n    `≈ -119.297 - 283.228`\n    `≈ -402.525`\n\n**Final Calculation: Combine the two parts**\n\nTotal Integral = (Result of Part 1) + (Result of Part 2)\nTotal Integral = `5.0625 + (-402.525)`\nTotal Integral = `-397.4625`\n\n<<<-397.4625>>>"
