    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question is a riddle that connects several seemingly disparate elements:\n1.  **A location:** The wide boulevards of Vienna.\n2.  **A context:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n3.  **A subject:** The surname of an English poet.\n4.  **The connection:** The poet's surname appears *within the description* of the boulevards.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Core of the Riddle\nThe core of this type of riddle is almost always a pun or a play on words. The surname of the English poet must sound very similar to a Russian word that would be used to describe the Viennese boulevards. The \"Russian translation of an essay\" is the framing device that makes this linguistic crossover possible.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Potential Descriptive Words\nWhat are the wide boulevards of Vienna (like the Ringstrasse) known for?\n*   They are wide and spacious.\n*   They are lined with grand buildings.\n*   They are famous for their trees, greenery, and parks.\n\nLet's focus on the trees, as this offers a rich source for descriptive, sensory words. A common and evocative sound associated with tree-lined boulevards is the sound of the wind in the leaves.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Russian Word and the Corresponding Poet\n1.  The Russian word for the \"rustling\" sound of leaves is **\"шелест\" (pronounced \"shelest\")**.\n2.  This word would be a very natural choice when describing the atmosphere of Vienna's boulevards in an essay. For example, a sentence might read: \"...и слышался тихий **шелест** листвы\" (...i slyshalsya tikhiy **shelest** listvy), meaning \"...and the quiet **rustle** of the foliage could be heard.\"\n3.  Now, we need to find an English poet whose surname sounds like \"шелест\" (shelest).\n4.  The famous English Romantic poet is Percy Bysshe **Shelley**.\n5.  In Russian, his name is written as **Шелли (pronounced \"Shelli\")**.\n6.  The phonetic similarity between the descriptive word **\"шелест\" (shelest)** and the surname **\"Шелли\" (Shelley)** is the key to solving the riddle. When a Russian reader encounters the word \"шелест\" in this context, the name \"Шелли\" is playfully invoked.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **The \"translation\" aspect:** This detail is crucial because it sets the scene for a Russian word to be used. The original essay might have been in English, German, or another language, but it's the Russian version where the pun comes to life.\n*   **The poet's nationality:** The question specifies an *English* poet, which Shelley is.\n*   **The context:** The description of \"wide boulevards\" makes the word \"rustle\" (шелест) a very plausible and fitting descriptor.\n*   **Avoiding red herrings:** One might think of other poets like Byron (Байрон) and try to connect it to a Russian word like \"газон\" (gazon - lawn), but the phonetic link is weaker, and the \"Shelley/шелест\" connection is a more classic and well-known example of this type of wordplay riddle.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe descriptive word for the rustling of leaves on the boulevards is \"шелест\" (shelest) in Russian. This sounds very similar to the surname of the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
