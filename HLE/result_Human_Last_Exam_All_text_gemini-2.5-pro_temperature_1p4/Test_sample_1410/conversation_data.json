    "This is a chess puzzle that requires finding a forced checkmate for White, assuming optimal play from both sides. The number of moves corresponds to the number of moves White needs to make to deliver the checkmate.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nThe position is given by the FEN `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`. It is White's turn to move.\n\nWhite has a powerful attacking setup with the Queen on d5, Knight on e5, and Bishop on h5, all aimed at the Black king. However, Black has a very dangerous Rook on e1, which threatens the White king on g1 and creates back-rank problems. White must act with precision and force.\n\nThe most promising continuation for White begins with a sacrifice to expose the Black king.\n\n**1. Qxf7+**\nThis move forces Black's hand. The Queen captures the pawn on f7 and delivers a check.\n*   **1... Kh8**\nThis is the only legal move for the Black king.\n\n**2. Ng6+**\nWhite continues the attack with another check, moving the Knight from e5 to g6. This move forces Black to choose between moving the king back or capturing the knight. Optimal play from Black involves trying to survive as long as possible. Let's analyze Black's two main responses:\n\n*   **Case A: Black captures the Knight with 2... hxg6.** This line leads to a faster, but more complex, mate if misplayed. A deeper analysis shows White can win, but the line below is more definitively forcing.\n*   **Case B: Black moves the King with 2... Kh7.** This is Black's best attempt to defend, but it leads to a forced mate.\n\nWe will follow the line where Black plays optimally to defend, which is Case B.\n\n**2... Kh7**\nThe king moves back to h7.\n\n**3. Nf8+**\nA brilliant move. The Knight moves from g6 to f8, creating a **double check**. The Knight checks the king, and it also reveals a discovered check from the Bishop on h5. When there is a double check, the king must move.\n*   **3... Kh8**\nThis is the only legal move for the Black king.\n\n**4. Qxe8!**\nThis is the decisive move. White's Queen captures the Black Rook on e8. This move does three things simultaneously:\n1.  It removes a key defender of the Black king.\n2.  It creates the unstoppable threat of mate on g7 (Qxg7#).\n3.  It removes White's Queen from f7, preparing for other pieces to join the attack.\n\nBlack is now forced to defend against the immediate threat of `Qxg7#`. Black's best defense is to block the g-file.\n*   **4... g6**\nThe pawn moves from g7 to g6 to prevent the mate. Other moves like `...Qf6` or `...Qe7` also lead to mate.\n\n**5. Bxg6+**\nWhite's Bishop captures the pawn on g6, delivering another check.\n*   **5... Kg7**\nThe Black king is forced to move to g7.\n\n**6. Qf7+**\nThe White Queen moves back to f7, delivering check.\n*   **6... Kh8**\nThe Black king is forced back to the corner.\n\n**7. Qh7#**\nWhite delivers the final blow. The Queen moves to h7, resulting in a checkmate. Let's verify the mating position:\n*   The Black king on h8 is checked by the Queen on h7.\n*   The king cannot move to h7 (attacked by the Queen on h7 and Bishop on g6).\n*   The king cannot move to g7 (attacked by the Bishop on g6).\n*   The king cannot move to g8 (attacked by the Knight on f8).\n\nThe sequence of White's moves leading to this forced checkmate is:\n1.  Qxf7+\n2.  Ng6+\n3.  Nf8+\n4.  Qxe8\n5.  Bxg6+\n6.  Qf7+\n7.  Qh7#\n\nWhite delivers checkmate in 7 moves.\n\n>>>7"
