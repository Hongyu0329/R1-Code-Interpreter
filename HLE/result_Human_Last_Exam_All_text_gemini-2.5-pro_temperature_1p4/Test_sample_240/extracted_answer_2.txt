The primary reason is that the coil is in its default "detuned" or "safe" state. Modern MRI coils have active electronic circuits (usually involving PIN diodes) that shift their resonant frequency far away from the operating frequency during the high-power transmit pulse of the MRI scanner. This is a critical safety feature to prevent patient burns and protect the electronics. When the coil is on a test bench, it is not receiving the DC bias signal from the scanner that is required to switch it into its resonant "receive" mode. Therefore, the absence of a resonance peak is expected and indicates the safety circuit is likely working correctly.
