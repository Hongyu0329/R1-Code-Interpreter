    "This is a question of counter-factual linguistic history. To answer it, we must trace the etymology of the current word \"sister\" and then determine how its Old English ancestor would have evolved without any external influence from Old Norse.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the etymology of the modern word \"sister\".**\nThe modern English word \"sister\" is a result of the interaction between two very similar words from two closely related languages: Old English and Old Norse.\n*   **Old English (Anglo-Saxon):** The native word for sister was **swustor** (also spelled *sweostor*).\n*   **Old Norse (the language of the Vikings):** The word for sister was **systir**.\n\nBoth words descend from a common Proto-Germanic ancestor, *swestēr. Because they are so similar (they are cognates), the Old Norse word didn't completely replace the Old English one. Instead, it heavily influenced its pronunciation and spelling. The modern form \"sister,\" with its \"i\" vowel and hard /s/ and /t/ sounds, is phonetically much closer to the Old Norse *systir* than the Old English *swustor*. In essence, the Norse form won out over the native English one.\n\n**Step 2: Remove the Norse influence.**\nThe core of the question is to imagine an English language that never experienced the Viking invasions between the 7th and 12th centuries. In this scenario, the Old Norse word *systir* would never have entered the language to compete with or influence the native Old English word *swustor*. Therefore, we must trace the natural, uninfluenced development of *swustor* into Modern English.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the phonological development of Old English \"swustor\".**\nWe need to apply the regular sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English to the word *swustor*.\n\n*   **From Old English to Middle English:**\n    *   The initial `sw-` cluster in `swustor` was often simplified. The weak 'w' sound following the 's' was lost before the vowel 'u'.\n    *   The vowels in unstressed final syllables were reduced to a schwa sound (/ə/), often spelled with an 'e'.\n    *   This transformed **swustor** into the common Middle English form **suster**. This form is well-attested in Middle English texts, like those by Chaucer, where it existed alongside the Scandinavian-influenced \"sister\".\n\n*   **From Middle English to Modern English:**\n    *   The key change here involves the vowel sound. The Middle English word `suster` was pronounced roughly as \"sooster\" or \"suster\" (with a short /ʊ/ vowel as in \"put\").\n    *   During the period leading to Modern English (including the Great Vowel Shift and other changes), the short /ʊ/ sound regularly became the /ʌ/ sound (the \"STRUT\" vowel, as in \"cup,\" \"but,\" or \"must\").\n    *   So, the pronunciation of `suster` would have evolved from /ˈsʊstər/ to /ˈsʌstər/.\n    *   The spelling would most likely have remained **Suster**, following the Middle English convention.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Cognates vs. Borrowing:** This is not a simple case of a foreign word being borrowed. It's a case where a cognate from a closely related language (Old Norse) influenced and ultimately replaced the native form (Old English). The modern word is a hybrid, but its sound and spelling owe more to Norse.\n2.  **Historical Evidence:** The hypothesized word is not a pure invention. The form **suster** was a very real and common word in Middle English, directly descended from Old English *swustor*. Its eventual loss in Standard English is the direct result of the Norse influence. Without that influence, there is every reason to believe it would have survived.\n3.  **Regular Sound Change:** The projection from Middle English `suster` to a Modern English `Suster` (pronounced /ˈsʌstər/) follows the most common and predictable sound changes that affected the English language.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf the Norse had never invaded and their language had not influenced Old English, the native word *swustor* would have evolved naturally through its documented Middle English form *suster*. Following standard English sound changes, the modern word would be spelled the same as its Middle English predecessor but pronounced differently.\n\nTherefore, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be **Suster**.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
