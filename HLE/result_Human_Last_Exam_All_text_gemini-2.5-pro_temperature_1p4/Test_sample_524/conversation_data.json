    "This problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of topological spaces that satisfy three properties simultaneously: they must be planar, they must be continua, and they must be homogeneous. Let's break down the problem by analyzing each term and then combining them to find all possible spaces.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terms\n\n1.  **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a compact and connected metric space.\n    *   *Compact* in the plane (R²) means the set must be closed and bounded.\n    *   *Connected* means the set cannot be split into two disjoint non-empty open subsets. Intuitively, it's a single \"piece\".\n\n2.  **Planar:** A space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, R². This means there is a homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) from the space to a subset of R².\n\n3.  **Homogeneous:** A space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism f from X to itself (an autohomeomorphism) such that f(x) = y. This is a very strong symmetry property; it implies that the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n\nWe are therefore looking for the number of distinct topological \"shapes\" that are compact, connected, embeddable in the plane, and look the same from every point.\n\n### Step 2: The Locally Connected Case\n\nA major dividing line in the study of continua is the property of **local connectedness**. Let's first consider homogeneous planar continua that are also locally connected.\n\n*   **Key Theorem (Bing, 1952):** A homogeneous, locally connected continuum is a topological manifold.\n*   A **topological manifold** is a space where every point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open ball in Euclidean space Rⁿ for some n. This n is the dimension of the manifold.\n\nNow we must find which compact, connected manifolds are planar and homogeneous.\n\n1.  **0-Manifold:** The only compact, connected 0-manifold is a **single point**.\n    *   *Continuum?* Yes (compact and connected).\n    *   *Planar?* Yes (it's a point in R²).\n    *   *Homogeneous?* Yes (for any two points x, y, they must be the same point, so the identity map works).\n    *   This gives us our **first class**.\n\n2.  **1-Manifold:** The only compact, connected 1-manifold is the **circle (S¹)**.\n    *   *Continuum?* Yes (closed, bounded, and connected in R²).\n    *   *Planar?* Yes (it lives in R²).\n    *   *Homogeneous?* Yes (any point can be mapped to any other point by a rotation, which is a homeomorphism).\n    *   The circle is clearly not homeomorphic to a point. This gives us our **second class**.\n\n3.  **2-Manifold:** The simplest compact, connected 2-manifold is the 2-sphere (S²). However, S² is not planar. No 2-manifold can be embedded in R². Thus, there are no 2-dimensional homogeneous planar continua.\n\n4.  **Higher-dimensional manifolds** cannot be embedded in the plane.\n\nSo, under the assumption of local connectedness, there are exactly two such homeomorphism classes: the point and the circle.\n\n### Step 3: The Non-Locally Connected Case\n\nNow we must consider homogeneous planar continua that are *not* locally connected. This is where more exotic spaces from continuum theory appear.\n\n*   **Key Concept: Indecomposable Continua.** A continuum is indecomposable if it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Such continua are path-connected nowhere and are not locally connected.\n\n1.  **The Pseudo-arc:** The pseudo-arc is the prime example.\n    *   *Continuum?* Yes, it is a compact, connected space.\n    *   *Planar?* Yes, it is typically constructed within the plane.\n    *   *Homogeneous?* Yes, this is a celebrated and difficult result proven by R.H. Bing in 1951. In fact, it is \"strongly\" homogeneous.\n    *   It is not locally connected, so it cannot be homeomorphic to the point or the circle. It is also indecomposable. This gives us our **third class**.\n\n2.  **Other Possibilities:** Are there any others? Another famous homogeneous continuum is the solenoid, but it is known that solenoids cannot be embedded in the plane. What about decomposable, non-locally connected examples?\n\n3.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** This space is constructed by taking a circle and replacing each point with a pseudo-arc in a continuous way. It can be thought of as a continuous decomposition of a plane continuum (e.g., a thickened circle, or annulus) into a collection of pseudo-arcs, where the decomposition space is a circle.\n    *   *Continuum?* Yes.\n    *   *Planar?* Yes.\n    *   *Homogeneous?* Yes, this was proven by J. T. Rogers, Jr. in 1979.\n    *   This space is not homeomorphic to the previous three. It is not locally connected, distinguishing it from the point and circle. It contains simple closed curves (unlike the pseudo-arc), and it is decomposable (it can be represented as the union of two \"semi-circles of pseudo-arcs,\" each of which is a proper subcontinuum), distinguishing it from the pseudo-arc. This gives us our **fourth class**.\n\n### Step 4: The Final Classification Theorem\n\nThe search for all homogeneous planar continua was a long-standing problem in topology. The final piece of the puzzle was provided by L. Oversteegen and E. Tymchatyn in 1992. Their work completed a proof of the following classification theorem.\n\n**Theorem:** Every homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of the following four spaces:\n1.  The point\n2.  The circle\n3.  The pseudo-arc\n4.  The circle of pseudo-arcs\n\nThis theorem asserts that our list is complete and there are no other examples.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points and Distinctions\n\nTo ensure these four classes are distinct, we can check their topological properties:\n\n| Space                  | Locally Connected? | Decomposable? | Contains a Simple Closed Curve? |\n| ---------------------- | :----------------: | :-----------: | :---------------------------: |\n| **Point**              |        Yes         |      No       |              No               |\n| **Circle**             |        Yes         |      Yes      |              Yes              |\n| **Pseudo-arc**         |         No         |      No       |              No               |\n| **Circle of Pseudo-arcs**|         No         |      Yes      |              Yes              |\n\nAs the table shows, all four spaces have a unique combination of these topological properties, proving they belong to four distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the complete classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua, there are exactly four such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
