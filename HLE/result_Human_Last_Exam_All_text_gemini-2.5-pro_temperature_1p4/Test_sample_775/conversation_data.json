    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Problem Statement\n\nLet's break down the conditions given in the question:\n1.  **Subsets of the plane:** We are working in R².\n2.  **Two sets, A and B:** These are the sets we need to consider.\n3.  **Closed:** Both A and B are closed sets. Since their union is the unit square (which is bounded), A and B are also bounded, and therefore compact.\n4.  **Connected:** Both A and B are connected. A compact connected set is also known as a continuum.\n5.  **Union is the unit square:** `A U B = S`, where `S = [0,1] x [0,1]`.\n6.  **The Goal:** Find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection, `A ∩ B`.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Thoughts and Simple Cases\n\n-   **Case n=1:** Can the intersection have one component? Yes. Let A be the left half of the square `[0, 1/2] x [0,1]` and B be the right half `[1/2, 1] x [0,1]`. Both are closed and connected. Their union is the square. Their intersection is the line segment `{1/2} x [0,1]`, which is connected. So, 1 component is possible.\n\n### Step 3: Using Tools from Topology\n\nA powerful tool in this kind of problem is algebraic topology. Let's consider a key theorem.\n\n**The Wilder Theorem (a consequence of Alexander Duality):**\nIf `H` and `K` are two continua (compact connected sets) in the n-sphere S^n whose union is S^n, then their intersection `H ∩ K` must also be a continuum (i.e., compact and connected).\n\nHow can we apply this to our problem in the unit square `S`?\n1.  We can topologically transform the square `S` into a 2-sphere, `S^2`, by identifying the entire boundary of the square (`∂S`) to a single point. Let's call this point `P`. This transformation is a continuous map, `q: S -> S^2`.\n2.  Our sets `A` and `B` are closed and connected subsets of `S`, so they are continua.\n3.  Their images under the map `q`, let's call them `A* = q(A)` and `B* = q(B)`, are also continua because they are continuous images of continua.\n4.  The union `A* U B* = q(A) U q(B) = q(A U B) = q(S) = S^2`.\n5.  Now we can apply the Wilder Theorem to `A*` and `B*`. The theorem states that their intersection, `A* ∩ B*`, must be a continuum (and therefore connected).\n6.  The intersection is `A* ∩ B* = q(A) ∩ q(B) = q(A ∩ B)`. Let's denote `C = A ∩ B`. So, `q(C)` must be connected.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the \"Connectedness of q(C)\" Condition\n\nWhat does it mean for `q(C)` to be connected?\n-   The map `q` only affects the boundary of the square `∂S`. It leaves the interior of the square `Int(S)` unchanged.\n-   Let `C_1, C_2, ..., C_k` be the connected components of `C = A ∩ B`.\n-   `q(C) = q(C_1) U q(C_2) U ... U q(C_k)`.\n-   For `q(C)` to be connected, the sets `q(C_i)` cannot be partitioned into two disjoint non-empty open sets.\n-   Consider a component `C_i` that lies entirely within the interior of the square (`C_i ⊂ Int(S)`). The map `q` doesn't affect it, so `q(C_i) = C_i`. This set `q(C_i)` would be disjoint from `q(C_j)` for all `j ≠ i` and also disjoint from the point `P`. This would make `q(C_i)` a separate connected component of `q(C)`, contradicting the fact that `q(C)` is connected (unless k=1).\n-   **Conclusion from Step 4:** This implies that if `A ∩ B` has more than one component, then **every component must touch the boundary of the square, ∂S.**\n\n### Step 5: Constructing an Example with Multiple Components\n\nThis leads to the main question: can we construct valid sets A and B such that their intersection `C` has `n` components, where `n > 1`? According to our finding, all `n` components must touch the boundary `∂S`.\n\nLet's try to construct an example for `n=2`.\n1.  **Define the desired intersection `C`:** Let `C` consist of two disjoint components. For example, let `B_annulus` be a closed annulus (a disk with a smaller concentric disk removed) situated entirely inside the square `S`. Its boundary, `∂B_annulus`, consists of two disjoint circles, an inner one `C_i` and an outer one `C_o`. Let our target intersection be `C = C_i U C_o`. This seems to violate the rule that components must touch the boundary `∂S`. So this `C` is not possible.\n\nLet's refine the construction based on the rule from Step 4.\n1.  **Define `B`:** Let `D` be a closed disk inside `S`. Let `B = cl(S \\ D)`. `B` is the square with an open disk removed. `B` is closed and connected. The boundary of `B` is `∂B = ∂S U ∂D`. It has two components.\n2.  **Define `A`:** Let `A = cl(S \\ B) = cl(D) = D`. `A` is connected.\n3.  **Check properties:**\n    *   A, B are closed and connected.\n    *   `A U B = D U cl(S \\ D) = S`.\n    *   `A ∩ B = D ∩ cl(S \\ D) = ∂D`. This has only **1 component**. This construction does not work.\n\nLet's try a more sophisticated construction, which is known to work for any finite number of components `n`.\n1.  **Define a set B:** Start with a closed disk `D` inside `S`. Remove `n-1` small, disjoint open disks `D_k` from the interior of `D`. Let this new set be `B = D \\ (U_{k=1}^{n-1} D_k)`.\n    *   This set `B` is closed and connected (it's a disk with holes).\n    *   Its boundary `∂B` consists of `n` disjoint circles: the outer boundary `∂D` and the `n-1` inner boundaries `∂D_k`. So `∂B` has `n` components.\n2.  **Define a set A:** Let `A` be the union of the rest of the square and some \"bridges\" to make it connected.\n    *   The complement `S \\ B` consists of two parts: the region outside the disk `D`, let's call it `K_out`, and the `n-1` holes `D_k`. So `cl(S \\ B) = cl(K_out) U (U_{k=1}^{n-1} cl(D_k))`. This set is disconnected.\n    *   To make `A` connected, we must add paths that connect these pieces. Let `P_k` be a path that connects the boundary of `K_out` (`∂D`) to the boundary of each hole `cl(D_k)`. These paths must lie in `A`, and therefore must not be in `B` (except at their endpoints). We can draw these paths in `S \\ B`.\n    *   Let `A = cl(S \\ B) U (U P_k)`.\n3.  **Check properties:**\n    *   `B` is closed and connected.\n    *   `A` is constructed to be connected, and it is a union of closed sets, so it is closed.\n    *   `A U B = (cl(S \\ B) U Paths) U B = S`, since `cl(S \\ B) U B` is already `S`.\n    *   `A ∩ B = (cl(S \\ B) U Paths) ∩ B`. This intersection is exactly `∂B`.\n    *   The intersection `A ∩ B = ∂B` has **n components**.\n\nThis construction works for any finite `n`. We can place the disk `D` and the paths `P_k` inside the unit square.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nSince we can construct an example where the intersection has `n` components for any arbitrary positive integer `n`, there is no largest number. The number of components can be arbitrarily large. Therefore, there is no finite maximum.\n\nThe supremum of the number of possible components is infinity.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
