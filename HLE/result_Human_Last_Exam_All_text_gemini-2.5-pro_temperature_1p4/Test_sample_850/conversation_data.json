    "This is a subtle question that hinges on the precise physical definition of what allows for optical activity. Let's analyze the question step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terms\n\nFirst, we must have a clear understanding of the three properties requested for the crystal classes:\n\n1.  **Achiral:** A crystal class is achiral if its symmetry includes at least one improper rotation axis (S_n). This includes a center of inversion (i or \\bar{1}, which is S_2) and a mirror plane (m, which is S_1). An achiral object is superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment (i.e., it is not pyroelectric). This means there is no unique direction in the crystal that is not mapped onto its opposite by a symmetry operation. All centrosymmetric classes are non-polar. Several non-centrosymmetric classes are also non-polar (e.g., 222, 422). The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n3.  **Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity:** This is the most crucial part to analyze carefully.\n    *   **Classical/Simplified View:** It is often taught that optical activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light) is only possible in chiral crystal classes. Chirality is the absence of any improper rotation axes. If we strictly follow this rule, an **achiral** class cannot be optically active. This would make the question a contradiction, and the answer would be \"None\".\n    *   **Physical/Modern View:** The underlying physical property that causes optical activity is called gyrotropy. It is a spatial dispersion effect described by a third-rank pseudotensor (the gyrotropy tensor, γ_ijk). Neumann's Principle dictates which tensor components can be non-zero for a given crystal symmetry. It turns out that this tensor is forced to be entirely zero *only* for crystal classes that possess a center of inversion (i), and also for two specific non-centrosymmetric classes: \\bar{6} and \\bar{6}m2. Therefore, any non-centrosymmetric class (except \\bar{6} and \\bar{6}m2) has the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\", even if it is achiral. This nuanced understanding is necessary to answer the question correctly.\n\nGiven the phrasing, the question is likely probing this deeper physical understanding. We will proceed by identifying the crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n*   Achiral\n*   Non-polar\n*   Non-centrosymmetric (and not \\bar{6} or \\bar{6}m2)\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Search of the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nWe will filter the 32 classes based on our criteria.\n\n**Criterion 1: Must have the correct symmetry for optical activity.**\nThis means the class must be non-centrosymmetric and not \\bar{6} or \\bar{6}m2.\n*   The 11 centrosymmetric classes are: \\bar{1}, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, \\bar{3}, \\bar{3}m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m\\bar{3}, m\\bar{3}m. These are eliminated.\n*   The 2 special non-gyrotropic classes are: \\bar{6} and \\bar{6}m2. These are also eliminated.\n*   This leaves 19 classes that are potentially the answer: 1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, \\bar{4}, 422, 4mm, \\bar{4}2m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, 622, 6mm, 23, 432, \\bar{4}3m.\n\n**Criterion 2: Must be Non-polar.**\nFrom our list of 19, we now eliminate the polar classes.\n*   The 10 polar classes are: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n*   Removing these from our list of 19 leaves: 222, \\bar{4}, 422, \\bar{4}2m, 32, 622, 23, 432, \\bar{4}3m.\n*   This gives us a list of 9 classes that are non-polar and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n**Criterion 3: Must be Achiral.**\nFrom our current list of 9 classes, we must now select only the ones that are achiral.\n*   The classes are: {222, \\bar{4}, 422, \\bar{4}2m, 32, 622, 23, 432, \\bar{4}3m}.\n*   Let's check for chirality (presence of only proper rotation axes):\n    *   222, 422, 32, 622, 23, 432 are all **chiral**.\n*   Let's check for achirality (presence of an improper rotation axis):\n    *   **\\bar{4}**: Achiral (contains an S₄ axis).\n    *   **\\bar{4}2m**: Achiral (contains an S₄ axis and mirror planes).\n    *   **\\bar{4}3m**: Achiral (contains mirror planes).\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nBy systematically applying the three conditions based on a modern physical understanding of gyrotropy, we find that there are three crystal classes that meet all criteria. They are achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary non-centrosymmetric symmetry to permit optical activity (gyrotropy).\n\nThe classes are: \\bar{4}, \\bar{4}2m, and \\bar{4}3m.\n\n<<<\\bar{4}, \\bar{4}2m, \\bar{4}3m>>>"
