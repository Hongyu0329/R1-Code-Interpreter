    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the key elements of the question:**\n*   **Object:** A Luxor Obelisk.\n*   **Criteria:** Must be a winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n*   **Condition:** Must be the *first* such winner to depict the object on-screen.\n\n**2. Identify the locations of the Luxor Obelisks:**\nThere are two obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt. It is crucial to know where they are now, as a depiction of either would satisfy the question.\n*   One obelisk remains at its original location in front of the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n*   The second obelisk was transported to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\n\n**3. Create a strategy:**\nThe strategy is to go through the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, starting from the first award in 1928, and check if any of them are set in or feature scenes from either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris, France. The first film that contains a verifiable on-screen image of either obelisk will be the answer.\n\n**4. Chronological review of Best Picture Winners:**\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Early winners like *Wings* (1928), *The Broadway Melody* (1929), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930), and *It Happened One Night* (1934) are set in locations like World War I battlefields, New York City, Germany, and the American roadways. None are set in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   ***The Great Ziegfeld* (1936):** This biopic of the Broadway producer is primarily set in the United States. It includes a sequence in Monte Carlo, but not Paris. Therefore, it does not depict the obelisk.\n\n*   ***The Life of Emile Zola* (1937):** This film is set in Paris and is the first Best Picture winner to take place in a city with a Luxor Obelisk. This makes it a potential candidate.\n    *   **Careful Point:** However, films of this era were often shot entirely on studio backlots. *The Life of Emile Zola* was filmed primarily at Warner Bros. studios in California. While it features impressive sets recreating Parisian streets and interiors, it does not use on-location shooting for major landmarks. There are no scenes that depict the Place de la Concorde or its famous obelisk.\n\n*   **1938-1950:** The winners during this period, including *Gone with the Wind* (1939), *Casablanca* (1942), and *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), are set in the American South, Morocco, and a Midwestern U.S. town, respectively. None feature Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** This film is set entirely in Paris and is renowned for its musical sequences that celebrate the city's beauty and landmarks.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A key scene is the musical number for the song **\"'S Wonderful\"**. In this sequence, characters Gene (Gene Kelly) and Henri (Georges Gu√©tary) sing and dance around the fountains in the Place de la Concorde. The Luxor Obelisk is prominently and clearly visible in the background throughout this famous scene.\n\n**5. Evaluate potential for the Egyptian Obelisk:**\nWe must also check if any early Best Picture winner was set in Luxor, Egypt. A review of the winners list before 1951 confirms that none were set there. Later winners that feature Egypt, such as *The English Patient* (1996), came decades after *An American in Paris*.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\nWhile *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) was the first Best Picture winner set in Paris, it does not actually show the Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The first Best Picture winner to feature a confirmed, clear depiction of a Luxor Obelisk is *An American in Paris* (1951), which showcases the one located in the Place de la Concorde.\n\n***\n\nThe first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was *An American in Paris*. The film, which won in 1951, prominently features the obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde in Paris during the \"'S Wonderful\" musical number.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
