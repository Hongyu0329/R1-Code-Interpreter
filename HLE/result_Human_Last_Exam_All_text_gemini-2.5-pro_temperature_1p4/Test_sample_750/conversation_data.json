    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the equation and the multi-valued nature of complex exponentiation.**\nThe given equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nThe term $i^z$ is a multi-valued complex exponentiation, defined as $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)}$.\nThe logarithm of $i$, $\\log(i)$, is also multi-valued. In polar form, $i = 1 \\cdot e^{i\\pi/2}$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nTo simplify, let's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$.\nThen $\\log(i) = iC_k$.\nThe equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z(iC_k)} = e^{izC_k}$.\nA complex number $z$ is a solution if there exists an integer $k$ for which this equation holds.\n\n**Step 2: Set up a system of equations in terms of real and imaginary parts.**\nLet $z = x+iy$, where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is $z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y + ix$.\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is $e^{izC_k} = e^{i(x+iy)C_k} = e^{(ix-y)C_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k} = e^{-yC_k} \\cdot e^{ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{ixC_k} = \\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k)$.\nSo, the RHS is $e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\nEquating the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + ix = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k) + i e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$.\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts, we obtain a system of two equations:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the system for different cases.**\nWe analyze the solutions by considering different cases for $x$ and $y$.\n\n**Case A: Real solutions ($z=x$, so $y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $0 = e^0 \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n2.  $x = e^0 \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\nFrom equation (1), $\\cos(xC_k)=0$ implies that $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\nSubstitute this into equation (2): $x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi) = (-1)^m$.\nThis implies that $x$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\n*   If $x=1$: We must have $m$ be an even integer. Also, $1 \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi$.\n    $\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+2m) \\implies 1+4k = 1+2m \\implies m=2k$.\n    For any integer $k$, $m=2k$ is an even integer, which is consistent with $x=1$. So $z=1$ is a potential solution. We check if there exists a $k$ for which $1 \\cdot i = i^1$ holds. The equation is $i=e^{i(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)}$, which is true for $k=0$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $x=-1$: We must have $m$ be an odd integer. Also, $(-1) \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + m\\pi$.\n    $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+2m) \\implies -1-4k = 1+2m \\implies m = -1-2k$.\n    For any integer $k$, $m=-1-2k$ is an odd integer, which is consistent with $x=-1$. So $z=-1$ is a potential solution. We check if there exists a $k$ for which $(-1) \\cdot i = i^{-1}$ holds. The equation is $-i=e^{-i(\\pi/2+2k\\pi)}$, which is true for $k=0$. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($z=iy$, so $x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n2.  $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0=0$. This is always true and provides no additional information.\nWe need to solve the equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $f(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$. We are looking for roots of $f(y)=0$.\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) > 0$. The derivative is $f'(y) = 1 - C_k e^{-yC_k}$. The function has a global minimum at $y = \\frac{\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$ with value $f_{min} = \\frac{1+\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$. Since $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1$, $\\ln(C_k)>0$, so $f_{min}>0$. Thus, $f(y)$ is always positive and has no real roots. There are no purely imaginary solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k < 0$. Let $D_k = -C_k > 0$. The equation becomes $-y = e^{yD_k}$, or $g(y) = e^{yD_k} + y = 0$. The derivative is $g'(y) = D_k e^{yD_k} + 1 > 0$. So $g(y)$ is a strictly increasing function. Since $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} g(y) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{y \\to +\\infty} g(y) = +\\infty$, there is exactly one real root $y_k$ for each $k \\le -1$.\nFurthermore, $g(0) = 1 > 0$. Since $g(y)$ is increasing, the root $y_k$ must be negative.\nThus, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k=iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real number satisfying $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$.\n\n**Case C: General complex solutions ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$)**\nFrom the system of equations:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\nAssuming $x\\ne 0$ and $\\cos(xC_k) \\ne 0$, we can divide (2) by (1) to get $\\frac{x}{-y} = \\tan(xC_k)$, which gives $y = -x\\cot(xC_k)$.\nLet $u=xC_k$, so $x=u/C_k$. Then $y = -(u/C_k)\\cot u$.\nSubstitute $x$ and $y$ into equation (2):\n$u/C_k = e^{-(-(u/C_k)\\cot u)C_k} \\sin(u)$\n$u/C_k = e^{u\\cot u} \\sin u$\nRearranging gives $\\frac{u}{C_k \\sin u} = e^{u\\cot u}$, which can be written as:\n$\\frac{u}{\\sin u}e^{-u\\cot u} = C_k$.\nThis transcendental equation defines values of $u=xC_k$ which lead to solutions. It can be shown that for each integer $k$, this equation has infinitely many real solutions for $u$. Each such solution $u$ (that doesn't make $\\cos u = 0$) generates a valid complex solution $z = x+iy$. While these solutions exist, they cannot be expressed in a simple closed form.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\nThe solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i = i^z$ fall into three categories:\n\n1.  **Real solutions**: There are two real solutions, $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions**: For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution of the form $z_k=iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real solution to the equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$. These solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function as $y_k = \\frac{W_0(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$.\n\n3.  **Other complex solutions**: There exists a doubly infinite set of non-real, non-purely imaginary complex solutions. For each integer $k$, the solutions are of the form $z=x+iy$ where $x = u/C_k$, $y=-(u/C_k)\\cot u$, and $u$ is a real solution to the equation $\\frac{u}{\\sin u}e^{-u\\cot u} = C_k$.\n\nThe problem asks for all $z$, so a complete description includes all these types."
