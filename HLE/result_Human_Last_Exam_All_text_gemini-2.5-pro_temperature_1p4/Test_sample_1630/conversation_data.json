    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Polynomials f(x) and g(x)**\n\n*   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are given as polynomials of degree 3. Let's represent them as:\n    $f(x) = c_3x^3 + c_2x^2 + c_1x + c_0$\n    $g(x) = d_3x^3 + d_2x^2 + d_1x + d_0$\n    where $c_3 \\neq 0$ and $d_3 \\neq 0$.\n\n*   The derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n    $f'(x) = 3c_3x^2 + 2c_2x + c_1$\n    $g'(x) = 3d_3x^2 + 2d_2x + d_1$\n\n*   For a quadratic polynomial $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($A>0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($B^2-4AC < 0$).\n    *   For $f'(x) > 0$: we must have $3c_3 > 0 \\implies c_3 > 0$, and $(2c_2)^2 - 4(3c_3)(c_1) < 0 \\implies 4c_2^2 - 12c_3c_1 < 0 \\implies c_2^2 < 3c_3c_1$.\n    *   For $g'(x) > 0$: we must have $3d_3 > 0 \\implies d_3 > 0$, and $(2d_2)^2 - 4(3d_3)(d_1) < 0 \\implies 4d_2^2 - 12d_3d_1 < 0 \\implies d_2^2 < 3d_3d_1$.\n\n*   A key property is that since their derivatives are always positive, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions over the entire real line.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Composite Function h(x) = f(g(x))**\n\n*   We are looking for the number of fixed points of $h(x)$, which are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n*   First, let's determine the degree of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n    $h(x) = c_3(d_3x^3 + \\dots)^3 + \\dots = c_3d_3^3x^9 + \\dots$\n    Since $c_3 \\neq 0$ and $d_3 \\neq 0$, the leading coefficient $c_3d_3^3$ is non-zero.\n    Thus, $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n*   The equation for the fixed points is $h(x) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**Step 3: Check if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable Using Calculus**\n\nTo have 9 distinct real roots for $h(x)=x$, the function $h(x)$ must be \"wiggly\" enough to intersect the line $y=x$ nine times. We can analyze this using derivatives.\n\n*   Let $P(x) = h(x) - x$. We are looking for the maximum number of roots of $P(x)$.\n*   By Rolle's Theorem, if $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   Similarly, if $P'(x)$ has $k-1$ roots, then $P''(x)$ must have at least $k-2$ roots.\n*   Let's find the derivatives of $h(x)$:\n    $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since $f'>0$ and $g'>0$, it follows that $h'(x)>0$, so $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n    $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$.\n    $P''(x) = h''(x)$. We need to find the degree of $h''(x)$.\n    Using the product rule and chain rule:\n    $h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)] = [f''(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)] \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$\n    $h''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Degree of h''(x)**\n\nLet's find the degrees of the terms in the expression for $h''(x)$:\n*   deg($g(x)$) = 3\n*   deg($g'(x)$) = 2\n*   deg($g''(x)$) = 1\n*   deg($f(x)$) = 3\n*   deg($f'(x)$) = 2\n*   deg($f''(x)$) = 1\n\nNow, let's find the degrees of the two terms in the sum for $h''(x)$:\n*   deg($f''(g(x))$) = deg($f''$) $\\times$ deg($g$) = $1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n*   deg($(g'(x))^2$) = $2 \\times$ deg($g'$) = $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   Degree of the first term, $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$, is $3 + 4 = 7$.\n\n*   deg($f'(g(x))$) = deg($f'$) $\\times$ deg($g$) = $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   Degree of the second term, $f'(g(x))g''(x)$, is $6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nBoth terms have a degree of 7. To find the degree of their sum, we must check if their leading coefficients cancel out.\n*   Leading term of $f''(g(x))$: $f''(y) \\approx 6c_3y$, $g(x) \\approx d_3x^3$. So, $f''(g(x)) \\approx 6c_3(d_3x^3) = 6c_3d_3x^3$.\n*   Leading term of $(g'(x))^2$: $g'(x) \\approx 3d_3x^2$. So, $(g'(x))^2 \\approx (3d_3x^2)^2 = 9d_3^2x^4$.\n*   Leading term of the first part is $(6c_3d_3x^3)(9d_3^2x^4) = 54c_3d_3^3x^7$.\n\n*   Leading term of $f'(g(x))$: $f'(y) \\approx 3c_3y^2$. So, $f'(g(x)) \\approx 3c_3(d_3x^3)^2 = 3c_3d_3^2x^6$.\n*   Leading term of $g''(x)$ is $6d_3x$.\n*   Leading term of the second part is $(3c_3d_3^2x^6)(6d_3x) = 18c_3d_3^3x^7$.\n\nThe leading coefficient of $h''(x)$ is the sum of these coefficients: $54c_3d_3^3 + 18c_3d_3^3 = 72c_3d_3^3$.\nSince $c_3>0$ and $d_3>0$, this coefficient is non-zero.\nTherefore, the degree of $h''(x)$ is exactly 7.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Since $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, it can have at most 7 real roots.\n*   This means $P''(x)$ can have at most 7 real roots.\n*   From Rolle's Theorem, this implies that $P'(x)$ can have at most $7+1=8$ real roots.\n*   This, in turn, implies that $P(x)=h(x)-x$ can have at most $8+1=9$ real roots.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points is therefore 9. This maximum is achievable, as it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which the resulting polynomial $h(x)=f(g(x))$ has a graph that oscillates close to the line $y=x$ in such a way as to create 9 intersections. The analysis shows that there are enough inflection points (roots of $h''(x)$) to allow for this."
