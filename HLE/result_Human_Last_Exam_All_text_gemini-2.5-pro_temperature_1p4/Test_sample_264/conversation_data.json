    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the Coordinate System and the First Cube\nTo analyze the problem, we'll use a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's place the first cube, let's call it Cube A, in a standard position with one corner at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its edges aligned with the x, y, and z axes.\n*   **Cube A:** This cube is defined by the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n*   The volume of Cube A is 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the \"Shift along the Main Diagonal\"\nThis is the most crucial step, as the wording can be interpreted in a couple of ways.\n*   **Main Diagonal:** For Cube A in our chosen position, the main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **The Shift:** The problem states the shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". This implies the shift is in the direction of the vector **d**. The phrase \"by 1/2\" most naturally means a shift by a vector that is half of the main diagonal vector itself.\n    *   Shift vector **s** = (1/2) * **d** = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n**Careful Point:** Another interpretation could be a shift of Euclidean distance 1/2 in the direction of the diagonal. This would result in a shift vector of `(1/2) * (unit vector in direction of d)`, which would be `(1/2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3)`. However, the first interpretation is much more standard for geometry problems of this nature and leads to a \"neater\" geometric arrangement where the corner of one cube is moved to the exact center of the other. We will proceed with the shift vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n### Step 3: Define the Second Cube\nThe second cube, Cube B, is identical to Cube A but shifted by the vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). To find the boundaries of Cube B, we add the shift vector components to the boundaries of Cube A.\n*   **Cube B:** This cube is defined by the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2   =>   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2   =>   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2   =>   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Region of Intersection\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We find the new boundaries for each coordinate by finding the intersection of their respective ranges.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:**\n    *   Cube A requires: 0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   Cube B requires: 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    *   The intersection of these two ranges is: max(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  **1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1**\n\n*   **For the y-coordinate:**\n    *   Cube A requires: 0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   Cube B requires: 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    *   The intersection is: max(0, 1/2) ≤ y ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  **1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1**\n\n*   **For the z-coordinate:**\n    *   Cube A requires: 0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n    *   Cube B requires: 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n    *   The intersection is: max(0, 1/2) ≤ z ≤ min(1, 3/2)  =>  **1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1**\n\n**Careful Point:** The shape of the intersection is a rectangular prism because the faces of both cubes are parallel to the coordinate planes. Since the side lengths are equal, the intersection is actually a smaller cube.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection\nThe intersection is a cube defined by the inequalities found in Step 4. We can find its volume by calculating the length of its sides.\n*   Length in x-direction: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Length in y-direction: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Length in z-direction: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n---\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  **Interpreting the Shift:** The key is to interpret \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" as a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This aligns one cube's corner with the other's center.\n2.  **Choosing Coordinates:** Setting up one cube at the origin with axis-aligned edges greatly simplifies the description of the volumes.\n3.  **Finding Intersection Bounds:** The process for finding the boundaries of the intersection is to take the most restrictive bounds for each coordinate (the maximum of the lower bounds and the minimum of the upper bounds).\n4.  **Final Shape:** Because the cubes are axis-aligned, their intersection is also a simple axis-aligned shape (a smaller cube), making the volume calculation straightforward.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
