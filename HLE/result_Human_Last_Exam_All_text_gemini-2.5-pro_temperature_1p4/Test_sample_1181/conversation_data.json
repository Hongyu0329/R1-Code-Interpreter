    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the core of the question.**\n    The question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying detail is a very specific quote or sentiment: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This implies a character who has been away from Earth for a long time, feels disconnected, and is having a moment of vulnerable, nostalgic confession.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the main characters as potential candidates.**\n    *   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. He is the newest arrival from Earth. While the entire film explores his connection to Earth and his memories, he has only just left it. The deep, long-term weariness implied by the quote is less characteristic of him than of the scientists who have been on the station for years.\n    *   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his dead wife, created by the Solaris ocean. She has never been on Earth as the person she is on the station and therefore has no memory of rustling leaves to miss.\n    *   **C. Dr. Snaut:** A cyberneticist and one of the two surviving scientists Kris meets. He has been on the station for a long time. He often serves as a philosophical guide for Kris, displaying a cynical, weary, and reflective demeanor born from his prolonged and strange experience. Such a poignant, world-weary confession would fit his character.\n    *   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** An astrobiologist and the other surviving scientist. He is portrayed as cold, rigidly scientific, and almost inhumanly focused on his work. He is secretive and distrustful. Admitting a sentimental longing like missing leaves would be highly uncharacteristic of him; he is more likely to view such feelings as a contemptible weakness.\n    *   **E. Gibarian:** Kris's friend and the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him through a video message he left. While his message conveys despair, it is a warning about the station and the \"guests,\" not a personal reflection on missing Earth in this specific way.\n\n*   **Step 3: Pinpoint the specific scene and dialogue.**\n    The line in question is spoken during a conversation between Kris Kelvin and Dr. Snaut. In a moment of vulnerability, fueled by alcohol and the oppressive atmosphere of the station, Snaut confesses his deep-seated homesickness. He says something to the effect of: \"I'm ashamed to say this, but I miss... the rustling of leaves.\" The shame comes from admitting such a simple, non-scientific, and deeply human feeling in the context of their grand, cosmic endeavor.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude based on the evidence.**\n    The character who explicitly states he is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. This moment reveals the human toll that the isolation and the station's phenomena have taken on him, hiding a deep nostalgia beneath his cynical exterior.\n\n<<<C>>>"
