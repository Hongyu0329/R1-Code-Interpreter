The product is a complex tetracyclic ketone. This molecule is formed through a sequence initiated by deprotonation of the tertiary alcohol with KH to form a potassium alkoxide. This intermediate then undergoes a stereospecific anionic oxy-Cope [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. In this rearrangement, the C1-C2 bond of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring cleaves, and a new C-C bond forms between C5 of the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring and C2 of the cyclopentenyl ring. The pi bonds shift to create a new double bond between C1 and C6 of the original bicyclic system and to form a potassium enolate. The final step, addition of H2O/MeOH, protonates the enolate at the alpha-carbon to yield the final ketone product. The 7,7-dimethoxy ketal and the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether groups remain unchanged throughout the sequence.
