    "### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\n1.  **Objective**: Compare two strings lexicographically.\n2.  **Input**: Two strings of the same length, containing uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. The length is between 1 and 100.\n3.  **Comparison Rule**: The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means 'a' is equivalent to 'A', 'b' to 'B', and so on.\n4.  **Output**:\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are identical (ignoring case).\n5.  **Constraint**: The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This implies we need to minimize the total memory allocated for variables.\n\n### Careful points to consider\n\n1.  **Memory Efficiency**: This is the primary constraint. A standard approach of reading both strings into two separate character arrays (e.g., `char s1[101], s2[101];`) would use over 200 bytes. To be memory-efficient, we should avoid storing both strings if possible.\n2.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: To compare characters `c1` and `c2` case-insensitively, we can convert both to a common case (either lower or upper) before comparison. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is suitable for this.\n3.  **Input Handling**: Standard input in C is a stream. After reading the first string (e.g., using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)`), the newline character (`\\n`) remains in the input buffer. This must be handled correctly before we start reading the second string.\n4.  **Same Length Guarantee**: The problem guarantees the strings are of the same length. This simplifies the logic, as we don't need to handle cases where one string is a prefix of another. We can iterate up to the length of the first string while reading characters from the second, knowing there will be a corresponding character to read.\n5.  **Data Types**: To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible data types for our variables. For a loop counter that goes from 0 to 100, an `unsigned char` (1 byte) is sufficient instead of a standard `int` (usually 4 bytes).\n\n### Step-by-step analysis to acquire the final answer\n\nTo find the total memory usage `m` for the most memory-efficient solution, we must design the program's logic and identify the necessary variables.\n\n1.  **Strategy**: The most memory-efficient strategy is to store only the first string in memory and then process the second string one character at a time from the input stream, performing the comparison on the fly. This avoids allocating a buffer for the second string.\n\n2.  **Variable Identification and Sizing**:\n    *   **First String Buffer**: We need to store the first string to compare against. The maximum length is 100 characters. In C, a string requires an extra byte for the null terminator (`\\0`). Therefore, we need a character array of size 101.\n        *   `char s1[101];` -> Memory usage = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n    *   **Loop Counter**: We need to iterate through the characters of the stored string `s1`. The string length is at most 100, so the index will go from 0 to 99. The smallest standard C data type that can hold this range is `unsigned char` (range 0-255).\n        *   `unsigned char i;` -> Memory usage = `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   **Second String Character**: Inside the loop, we will read one character from the second string using a function like `getchar()`. We must store this character in a variable to perform the comparison. Calling `getchar()` multiple times within the same loop iteration (e.g., in different `if` conditions) would incorrectly consume multiple characters from the input stream.\n        *   `char c2;` -> Memory usage = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Final Program Logic Outline**:\n    *   Declare the three variables identified above: `char s1[101]`, `unsigned char i`, and `char c2`.\n    *   Read the first line of input into `s1` using `scanf(\"%s\", s1)`.\n    *   Read and discard the single newline character left in the input buffer using `getchar()`.\n    *   Start a loop that runs from `i = 0` as long as `s1[i]` is not the null terminator.\n    *   Inside the loop, read a single character from the input stream into `c2` using `getchar()`.\n    *   Compare `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower(c2)`.\n    *   If `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)`, print \"-1\" and terminate the program.\n    *   If `tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)`, print \"1\" and terminate the program.\n    *   Increment `i`.\n    *   If the loop finishes without finding any differences, the strings are equal. Print \"0\".\n\n4.  **Total Memory Calculation (m)**:\n    The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\n    `m = (memory for s1) + (memory for i) + (memory for c2)`\n    `m = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte`\n    `m = 103 bytes`\n\nThis represents the minimum memory required for variables to solve the problem using standard C library functions.\n\n<<<103>>>"
