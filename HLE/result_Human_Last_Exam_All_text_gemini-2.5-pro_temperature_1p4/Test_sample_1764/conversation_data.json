    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings from a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$. We need to find:\n$\\min_{X, B} (\\text{Number of isometric embeddings } f: X \\to B)$\nwhere:\n*   $X = (X, d_X)$ is a finite ultrametric space.\n*   $B = (B, ||\\cdot||_B)$ is a Banach space of cardinality $K$.\n*   An isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, $d_X(x_1, x_2) = ||f(x_1) - f(x_2)||_B$.\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Existence of an Embedding:** Does an isometric embedding always exist? For any finite metric space $X$ (and thus for any finite ultrametric space), one can always construct an isometric embedding into a suitable Banach space. For instance, the Kuratowski embedding shows that any metric space $(X,d)$ can be isometrically embedded into the Banach space of bounded functions on $X$ with the sup norm. Since $X$ is finite, this Banach space is simply $\\mathbb{R}^{|X|}$ with the $l_\\infty$ norm. This means that for any valid choice of $X$, we can find a $B$ such that at least one embedding exists. Therefore, the number of embeddings is at least 1.\n\n*   **Role of Translations in the Banach Space:** Let's assume we have found one isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$. If the Banach space $B$ is non-trivial (i.e., $B \\neq \\{0\\}$), then it contains at least one non-zero vector $c \\in B$. We can define a new function $g: X \\to B$ by $g(x) = f(x) + c$. This function $g$ is different from $f$ because $g(x) - f(x) = c \\neq 0$. Let's check if $g$ is also an isometric embedding:\n    $||g(x_1) - g(x_2)||_B = ||(f(x_1) + c) - (f(x_2) + c)||_B = ||f(x_1) - f(x_2)||_B = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\n    Yes, $g$ is also an isometric embedding.\n\n*   **Implication of Translations:** If the Banach space $B$ has more than one element, and an isometric embedding $f$ exists, then we can generate a new, distinct isometric embedding $g$ via translation. In fact, for every element $c \\in B$, the function $f_c(x) = f(x) - f(x_0) + c$ (for a fixed $x_0 \\in X$) is a distinct isometric embedding. If $B$ is a standard Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, its cardinality $K$ is infinite, implying an infinite number of such embeddings. This seems to contradict the idea of a \"smallest possible number\" unless that number is infinity. However, the question seeks the *smallest possible number* over all choices of $X$ and $B$. This suggests we should look for a case that severely restricts the number of embeddings.\n\n*   **The Path to a Unique Embedding:** The argument above shows that to get a finite number of embeddings (and specifically, to minimize it), we must eliminate the possibility of creating new embeddings via translation. A unique embedding is only possible if there is only one choice for the translation vector $c$. This happens if and only if the Banach space $B$ contains only one element, which must be the zero vector.\n\n**3. Constructing the Minimal Case**\n\nLet's explore the case where the Banach space is the simplest possible one.\n\n*   **Choice of Banach Space B:** Let's choose the trivial Banach space $B = \\{0\\}$. This is a complete normed vector space with the norm $||0||=0$ and it has cardinality $K=1$.\n\n*   **Choice of Ultrametric Space X:** Now, what kind of finite ultrametric space $X$ can be isometrically embedded into $B=\\{0\\}$?\n    *   Let $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$ be an embedding. The only possible function is the one that maps every point in $X$ to the zero vector in $B$. So, $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in X$.\n    *   For this function $f$ to be an isometric embedding, the distance condition must be satisfied:\n        $d_X(x_1, x_2) = ||f(x_1) - f(x_2)||_B = ||0 - 0||_B = 0$\n        This must hold for all pairs of points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$.\n    *   The condition $d_X(x_1, x_2) = 0$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ has a strong implication based on the axioms of a metric space. The axiom of *identity of indiscernibles* states that $d(a,b)=0$ if and only if $a=b$. Therefore, all points in $X$ must be identical. This means that the set $X$ can contain only a single point.\n\n*   **Verifying the Minimal Case:**\n    *   Let's choose $X = \\{p\\}$, a space with a single point. This is a finite set. The only distance is $d_X(p, p) = 0$. The ultrametric inequality is trivially satisfied ($0 \\le \\max(0,0)$), so it is a finite ultrametric space.\n    *   Let's choose $B = \\{0\\}$, the trivial Banach space.\n    *   Let's find the number of isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$.\n        1.  There is only one possible function $f: \\{p\\} \\to \\{0\\}$, which is $f(p) = 0$.\n        2.  We must check if this function is an isometry. The condition is $d_X(p,p) = ||f(p) - f(p)||_B$. Substituting the values, we get $0 = ||0 - 0||_B = 0$, which is true.\n    *   Thus, for this specific choice of $X$ and $B$, there exists exactly one isometric embedding.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n1.  The number of isometric embeddings must be at least 1, as an embedding can always be constructed for any finite ultrametric space into some Banach space.\n2.  We have found a valid choice of a finite ultrametric space $X$ (a single-point space) and a Banach space $B$ (the trivial space $\\{0\\}$) for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1.\n3.  Since the number must be at least 1, and we have found a case where it is exactly 1, the smallest possible number is 1."
