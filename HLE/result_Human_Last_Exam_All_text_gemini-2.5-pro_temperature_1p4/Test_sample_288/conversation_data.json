    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the neuron (or neuron class) that receives the highest number of synapses from the axons of the ASJ neurons in an adult *C. elegans*.\n\n*   **Source Neuron:** ASJ. This is a pair of sensory neurons, ASJL and ASJR.\n*   **Source Neurite:** Axon. Synapses from ASJ are located along its axon in the nerve ring.\n*   **Target Neuron:** The postsynaptic partner cell.\n*   **Criterion for \"Main\":** The highest total number of synapses.\n*   **Organism and Stage:** Adult *C. elegans*.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Necessary Data**\nTo answer this question, we need to consult the *C. elegans* connectome. The connectome is a comprehensive map of all neural connections. The most relevant and modern datasets for the adult hermaphrodite are from publications by Cook et al. (2019) and Witvliet et al. (2021), which build upon the original work of White et al. (1986).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Synaptic Outputs of ASJ**\nWe must examine the efferent (outgoing) chemical synapses from both ASJL and ASJR. The analysis involves looking up the connectivity data for these two neurons and listing all their postsynaptic partners along with the corresponding synapse counts.\n\n*   ASJ neurons are known to be chemosensory and are involved in dauer formation, chemorepulsion, and other behaviors.\n*   Their axons project into the nerve ring, which is the main processing center (neuropil) of the worm's nervous system.\n*   They form synapses with several interneurons and motor neurons.\n\n**Step 4: Quantify and Compare Connections to Target Neurons**\nBy querying a C. elegans connectome database (like WormWiring) or reviewing the data from the relevant publications, we can tabulate the major postsynaptic partners of ASJ (summing synapses from both ASJL and ASJR). The primary targets include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   **AIY:** A major class of interneurons (AIYL and AIYR) that integrate sensory information.\n*   **AUA:** A class of interneurons (AUAL and AUAR).\n*   **PVQ:** A class of interneurons (PVQL and PVQR).\n*   **RMED/L/R/V:** A class of motor neurons.\n\nNow, we compare the synapse counts. Based on the consolidated connectome data (e.g., from Cook et al., 2019 or Witvliet et al., 2021), the connection strength can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   **ASJ -> AIY:** This is consistently the strongest connection. The total number of synapses from the ASJ pair to the AIY pair is significantly higher than to any other single neuron class. For instance, data shows dozens of synapses forming this connection.\n*   **ASJ -> AUA:** This is another significant target, but the total synapse count is lower than that for AIY.\n*   **ASJ -> PVQ:** This connection is also present but is weaker than the connection to AIY.\n*   **ASJ -> RME:** The connection to the RME motor neurons is also notable but does not surpass the connection to AIY in synapse number.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Main Target**\nThe quantitative analysis reveals a clear primary target. The AIY interneuron class receives the most synaptic inputs from the ASJ neuron pair. This strong connection is a key pathway for relaying sensory information related to pheromones and environmental cues from ASJ to downstream circuits that control behavior.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Neuron Naming:** ASJ refers to a pair of neurons (ASJL and ASJR). The question \"ASJ axons\" (plural) implies we should consider the combined output of both.\n2.  **Target Naming:** AIY is a class of two neurons (AIYL and AIYR). When asking for \"what cell,\" it is standard practice in C. elegans neurobiology to refer to the class (AIY) as the target.\n3.  **Data Source:** The answer relies on empirical data from electron microscopy reconstruction of the *C. elegans* nervous system. The numbers can vary slightly between different reconstructions or individual worms, but the identity of the top target remains consistent.\n4.  **Synapse Type:** The question does not specify synapse type (chemical vs. electrical). However, \"projection target\" and synapse number typically refer to chemical synapses, which are the primary means of directed information flow. The ASJ-AIY connection is mediated by chemical synapses.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the adult C. elegans connectome, the AIY interneuron class is the main recipient of synapses from ASJ axons.\n\n<<<AIY>>>"
