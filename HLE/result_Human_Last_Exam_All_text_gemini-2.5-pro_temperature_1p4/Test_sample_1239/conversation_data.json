    "Answering this question requires finding the number of independent one-parameter Lie groups of point transformations that leave the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations invariant. This number is the dimension of the associated Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\n    We consider the equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for an incompressible fluid with constant viscosity $\\nu$ and density $\\rho$ (which can be set to 1 by rescaling the pressure). In the absence of external forces, the equations are:\n    \n    *   **Momentum Equation:**\n        $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = - \\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n    *   **Incompressibility Condition:**\n        $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n        \n    Here, $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ is the velocity field, and $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ is the pressure. The independent variables are time $t$ and spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x}=(x_1, x_2, x_3)$. The dependent variables are the velocity components $u_i$ and the pressure $p$.\n\n2.  **Lie Group of Symmetries**\n    A Lie group of symmetries is a group of transformations on the independent and dependent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$ that maps any solution of the equations to another solution. We find the dimension of this group by finding the dimension of its Lie algebra. The elements of the Lie algebra are the infinitesimal generators of these symmetry transformations.\n\n3.  **Finding the Infinitesimal Generators**\n    The standard procedure involves applying a general infinitesimal generator to the equations and requiring invariance. This leads to a set of over-determined partial differential equations, called the \"determining equations,\" for the coefficients of the generator. Solving these equations yields the explicit form of all possible symmetry generators.\n    \n    While the full derivation is lengthy and complex (especially due to the non-local nature of pressure), the result is well-established in the field of mathematical physics. The analysis can be simplified by eliminating the pressure and working with the vorticity formulation of the equations.\n\n4.  **Listing the Symmetries and Counting the Dimensions**\n    The complete set of point symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations forms a Lie algebra known as the Galilean-similitude algebra. The corresponding transformations are listed below, along with the number of independent parameters (dimensions) each contributes.\n\n    *   **Time translation (1 dimension):** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$), so they are invariant under a shift in time:\n        $t' = t + \\epsilon$\n        This corresponds to one generator: $\\partial_t$.\n    \n    *   **Spatial translations (3 dimensions):** The equations are set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant coefficients, so they are invariant under shifts in space:\n        $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$\n        This corresponds to three independent generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$.\n\n    *   **Spatial rotations (3 dimensions):** The equations are isotropic (the same in all directions), so they are invariant under rotations of the coordinate system. Both the vector field $\\mathbf{u}$ and the gradient operators transform covariantly under rotations:\n        $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$ (where $R$ is a rotation matrix).\n        This corresponds to three generators for rotations about the $x_1, x_2, x_3$ axes (e.g., $x_2\\partial_{x_3} - x_3\\partial_{x_2} + u_2\\partial_{u_3} - u_3\\partial_{u_2}$).\n    \n    *   **Galilean boosts (3 dimensions):** The equations obey the principle of Galilean relativity. Shifting to a frame of reference moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is a symmetry:\n        $t' = t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$\n        The pressure also transforms, $p' = p - \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{v}|^2t$.\n        This corresponds to three generators, one for a boost in each spatial direction (e.g., $t\\partial_{x_1} + \\partial_{u_1}$).\n    \n    *   **Scaling (or Dilation) (1 dimension):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry. If we scale time, space, velocity, and pressure appropriately, the equations remain invariant. The specific scaling transformation is:\n        $t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$\n        This corresponds to a single generator, often written as $2t\\partial_t + \\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} - \\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} - 2p\\partial_p$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    The dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions from each independent type of symmetry.\n    \n    Dimension = (Time translation) + (Space translations) + (Rotations) + (Galilean boosts) + (Scaling)\n    Dimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is an 11-dimensional group, whose Lie algebra is the Galilean-similitude algebra.\n\n<<<11>>>"
