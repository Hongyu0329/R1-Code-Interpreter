The critical exponent for specific heat, Î±, scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, according to the relation $\alpha \approx \frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}(4-d)$, where N is the number of components of the scalar field. For the most common case of a single-component scalar field (N=1), this simplifies to $\alpha \approx \frac{1}{6}(4-d)$.
