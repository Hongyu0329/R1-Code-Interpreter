    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\" of a specific fuzzy rule within an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Inference System.\n*   **Inputs Given:**\n    1.  The antecedent firing strength, $\\Phi_k(x') = 0.7$. This represents the degree to which the input data $x'$ satisfies the IF part of the rule.\n    2.  The membership degree of an output value $y_j$ in the rule's consequent fuzzy set, $\\mu_{G_{k,j}}(y_j) = 0.9$. This represents the degree to which $y_j$ belongs to the THEN part of the rule.\n*   **Operation Required:** A t-norm (triangular norm) operation.\n*   **Context:** Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3FS).\n\n### Step 2: List All the Careful Points\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of the Term \"Rule Activation Level\":** In fuzzy logic, the \"rule activation level\" or \"firing strength\" most commonly refers only to the result of evaluating the antecedent (the IF part) of the rule. In this case, that value is explicitly given as $\\Phi_k(x') = 0.7$. However, the question asks to *calculate* a value using both the antecedent and consequent information with a t-norm. This strongly suggests that the question is actually asking for the result of the **implication step** in a Mamdani-style fuzzy system, which determines the shape of the output fuzzy set for that specific rule. We will proceed with this interpretation as it uses all the information provided.\n\n2.  **Inconsistency with the Formal Definition of IT3FS:** An Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set is a very complex structure where membership degrees are not simple numbers but Type-2 fuzzy sets. Therefore, the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree would not be single crisp values like 0.7 and 0.9. The question highly simplifies the concept, likely for demonstrating the core inference mechanism. We must assume these values are valid, scalar representations for the purpose of this calculation.\n\n3.  **Choice of T-norm:** A t-norm is a class of functions (like `min`, `product`, etc.) used to model the logical `AND` operation. The question does not specify which t-norm to use, and the result depends on this choice.\n    *   **Minimum t-norm:** $T(a, b) = \\min(a, b)$\n    *   **Product t-norm:** $T(a, b) = a \\cdot b$\n    *   **Lukasiewicz t-norm:** $T(a, b) = \\max(0, a+b-1)$\n\n4.  **Assumption of Standard Practice:** In the absence of a specified t-norm, the standard and most widely used choice in Mamdani fuzzy systems is the **minimum** operator. This process is often called \"clipping\" the consequent fuzzy set. We will use the minimum t-norm for our calculation based on this common convention.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\nBased on the interpretation and assumptions outlined above, we are calculating the membership degree of the value $y_j$ in the output fuzzy set of the k-th rule. This is done by applying a t-norm to the rule's antecedent firing strength and the original consequent membership degree.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Identify the values to be combined.**\n    *   Antecedent Firing Strength ($w$): $\\Phi_k(x') = 0.7$\n    *   Consequent Membership Degree ($\\mu$): $\\mu_{G_{k,j}}(y_j) = 0.9$\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Select the t-norm operation.**\n    *   As discussed in the careful points, we will use the most standard t-norm, which is the **minimum** function.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Apply the t-norm operation.**\n    *   The formula for the resulting membership degree is: Result = t-norm($w$, $\\mu$).\n    *   Substituting the values and the chosen operator: Result = $\\min(0.7, 0.9)$.\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Calculate the final value.**\n    *   The minimum of 0.7 and 0.9 is 0.7.\n\nTherefore, the resulting activation or output membership level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
