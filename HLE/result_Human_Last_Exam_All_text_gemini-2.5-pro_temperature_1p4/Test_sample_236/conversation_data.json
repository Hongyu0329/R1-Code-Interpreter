    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$):** This is an abelian group whose elements are equivalence classes of integral homology 3-spheres (oriented 3-manifolds $Y$ with the same integer homology as the 3-sphere $S^3$). Two such spheres, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are in the same class (i.e., are homology cobordant) if the disjoint union $Y_1 \\sqcup (-Y_2)$ (where $-Y_2$ is $Y_2$ with reversed orientation) is the boundary of a 4-manifold $W$ that has the same integer homology as a cylinder ($Y_1 \\times [0,1]$). The group operation is the connected sum ($#$). The identity element is the class of the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This refers to Dehn surgery on a knot $K$ in $S^3$ with an integer framing $p$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_p(K)$. For the result to be an *integral homology sphere*, its first homology group, $H_1(S^3_p(K);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|p|\\mathbb{Z}$, must be trivial. This occurs only when $|p|=1$. Thus, we are only concerned with $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n\n3.  **Knots with at most four crossings:** We need to consider all such knots. According to knot tables, these are:\n    *   0 crossings: The unknot ($0_1$).\n    *   3 crossings: The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($+3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$).\n    *   4 crossings: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Manifolds from Surgery\n\nWe perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of the knots identified above.\n\n1.  **Unknot ($0_1$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    Both surgeries yield the standard 3-sphere, which represents the **identity element** of $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\n2.  **Right-handed Trefoil ($+3_1$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(+3_1)$: This surgery produces the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(+3_1)$: This surgery produces a manifold homeomorphic to the Poincaré homology sphere, $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n\n3.  **Left-handed Trefoil ($-3_1$):**\n    The surgery manifold $S^3_p(-K)$ is orientation-reversedly homeomorphic to $S^3_{-p}(K)$.\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1) \\cong -S^3_{-1}(+3_1) \\cong -\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(+3_1) \\cong -\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n\n4.  **Figure-eight Knot ($4_1$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: This surgery produces a manifold homeomorphic to $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: This surgery produces a manifold homeomorphic to $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n\nSo, the set of all distinct manifolds (up to orientation-preserving homeomorphism) that we can generate is $\\{S^3, \\Sigma(2,3,5), -\\Sigma(2,3,5), \\Sigma(2,3,7), -\\Sigma(2,3,7)\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Distinguish the Homology Cobordism Classes\n\nWe need to determine how many distinct elements in $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ these manifolds represent. We use homology cobordism invariants.\n\n*   **Rokhlin Invariant ($\\mu$):** This is a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued invariant. It is known that the map $\\mu: \\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a surjective group homomorphism. A key result in low-dimensional topology (due to Manolescu) shows that this homomorphism splits, meaning $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\ker(\\mu)$. The $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summand is generated by any homology sphere with $\\mu=1$.\n\nLet's find the Rokhlin invariants of our manifolds:\n*   $\\mu(S^3) = 0$. This represents the identity element $(0,0)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\ker(\\mu)$.\n*   $\\mu(\\Sigma(2,3,5)) = 1$. The Poincaré sphere bounds the $E_8$-plumbing manifold, whose signature is $-8$. Thus $\\mu = -8/8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   $\\mu(\\Sigma(2,3,7)) = 1$. This is another well-known result.\n\nSince $\\mu(-Y)=\\mu(Y)$, all four non-trivial manifolds we've produced $(\\pm\\Sigma(2,3,5), \\pm\\Sigma(2,3,7))$ have $\\mu=1$. This means they all belong to the coset of $\\ker(\\mu)$ corresponding to the non-trivial element in the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ factor. An element $[Y]$ in this coset can be written as $(1, k)$ for some $k \\in \\ker(\\mu)$.\n\n*   **Distinguishing elements within the $\\mu=1$ coset:** Two elements $(1, k_1)$ and $(1, k_2)$ are distinct if and only if their kernel components, $k_1$ and $k_2$, are distinct. These components are distinguished by other invariants. A deep result by Fintushel and Stern states that two Seifert fibered homology spheres are homology cobordant only if they have the same (normalized) Seifert invariants.\n    *   $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ has Seifert invariants $\\{2,3,5\\}$.\n    *   $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ has Seifert invariants $\\{2,3,7\\}$.\n    Since $\\{2,3,5\\} \\neq \\{2,3,7\\}$, the spheres $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ and $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ are **not** homology cobordant.\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally of Elements\n\nLet's determine the distinct elements of $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\ker(\\mu)$ we have found. Let $[R]$ denote the class of $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$, which we can use as a representative for the generator of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ part. An element $[Y]$ corresponds to the pair $(\\mu(Y), [Y] - \\mu(Y)[R])$.\n\n1.  **Class of $S^3$:** $\\mu(S^3) = 0$. This corresponds to the identity element $(0,0)$. This is **1 element**.\n\n2.  **Class of $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$:** $\\mu=1$. Its class corresponds to $(1, [\\Sigma(2,3,7)] - [\\Sigma(2,3,7)]) = (1, 0)$. This represents the generator of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ part. This is our **2nd distinct element**. The class of $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ is the inverse of $(1,0)$, which is $(1,0)$ itself, so it's the same element.\n\n3.  **Class of $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$:** $\\mu=1$. Its class corresponds to $(1, [\\Sigma(2,3,5)] - [\\Sigma(2,3,7)])$. Since $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ and $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ are not homology cobordant, the kernel part $k = [\\Sigma(2,3,5)] - [\\Sigma(2,3,7)]$ is non-zero. So this represents the element $(1,k)$. This is our **3rd distinct element**.\n\n4.  **Class of $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$:** This is the inverse of the class of $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. The inverse of $(1,k)$ is $(1, -k)$. Since the kernel part $k$ is known to be of infinite order, $k \\neq -k$. Therefore, $(1, -k)$ is distinct from $(1, k)$. This is our **4th distinct element**.\n\nThe surgeries we listed produce representatives for precisely these four classes:\n*   $S^3_p(0_1) \\to (0,0)$\n*   $S^3_{+1}(+3_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(-3_1) \\to (1,0)$\n*   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ and $S^3_{+1}(-3_1) \\to (1,k)$\n*   $S^3_{-1}(+3_1)$ and $S^3_{+1}(4_1) \\to (1,-k)$\n\nIn total, we have found four distinct elements of the homology cobordism group.\n\n<<<4>>>"
