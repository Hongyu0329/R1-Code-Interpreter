    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of Large Deviation Theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Connecting Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics**\n\nLarge Deviation Theory (LDT) provides a framework for understanding the probabilities of rare events. The core idea is that the probability of an empirical average deviating from its expected value decreases exponentially with the number of samples, $N$. The rate of this decay is described by a \"rate function\" $I(x)$: $P(\\text{average} \\approx x) \\approx e^{-NI(x)}$.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the fundamental assumption is that for an isolated system, all accessible microstates are equally probable. The equilibrium macrostate is the one corresponding to the largest number of microstates, $\\Omega$. According to Boltzmann's principle, the entropy is $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$.\n\nThe probability of observing a particular macrostate is proportional to $\\Omega$, so $P(\\text{macrostate}) \\propto \\Omega = e^{S/k_B}$. Comparing this with the LDT form, we can see a direct analogy: maximizing the entropy $S$ is equivalent to minimizing a rate function $I$ that is proportional to $-S/k_B$. The equilibrium state is the most probable state, while all other states are \"large deviations\" and are exponentially suppressed in probability. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide the formal basis for these rate functions, which in this context are derived from the combinatorics of the particles.\n\n**2. The Entropy Functional for Bosons (Light Quanta)**\n\nFor a system of indistinguishable bosons, like light quanta (photons), we need to count the number of ways to distribute them among energy levels. Let there be $g_i$ available states (degeneracy) at energy level $E_i$, occupied by $n_i$ photons. The number of ways to do this is given by the Bose-Einstein counting formula:\n$\\Omega_i = \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$\n\nThe total number of microstates for a given configuration $\\{n_i\\}$ is $\\Omega = \\prod_i \\Omega_i$. The entropy is $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. Using Stirling's approximation for large $n_i$ and $g_i$, and defining the average occupation number per state as $\\langle n_i \\rangle = n_i/g_i$, the entropy can be expressed as a functional of the distribution $\\{\\langle n_i \\rangle\\}$:\n$S[\\{\\langle n_i \\rangle\\}] = k_B \\sum_i g_i [ (1+\\langle n_i \\rangle) \\ln(1+\\langle n_i \\rangle) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_i \\rangle ]$\n\nThis is the entropy that we need to maximize.\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy to Find the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nTo find the equilibrium state, we maximize the entropy $S$ subject to the physical constraints on the system.\n*   **Constraint 1: Fixed Total Energy.** The total energy $U$ of the system is constant: $U = \\sum_i n_i E_i = \\sum_i g_i \\langle n_i \\rangle E_i$.\n*   **Constraint 2 (or lack thereof): Particle Number.** For light quanta, the total number of photons is *not* conserved. They can be created and destroyed. This means we do not have a constraint on the total number of particles, which is equivalent to setting the chemical potential $\\mu$ to zero.\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S/k_B$ subject to the energy constraint. We seek to maximize the function:\n$L = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta (U - \\sum_i g_i \\langle n_i \\rangle E_i) = \\sum_i g_i [ (1+\\langle n_i \\rangle) \\ln(1+\\langle n_i \\rangle) - \\langle n_i \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_i \\rangle ] - \\beta (\\sum_i g_i \\langle n_i \\rangle E_i)$\n(We only need to maximize the part involving the variables $\\langle n_i \\rangle$).\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to a particular $\\langle n_j \\rangle$ and setting it to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\langle n_j \\rangle} \\left[ g_j [ (1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) \\ln(1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) - \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle ] - \\beta g_j \\langle n_j \\rangle E_j \\right] = 0$\n$g_j \\left[ \\ln(1+\\langle n_j \\rangle) - \\ln(\\langle n_j \\rangle) - \\beta E_j \\right] = 0$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+\\langle n_j \\rangle}{\\langle n_j \\rangle}\\right) = \\beta E_j \\implies 1 + \\frac{1}{\\langle n_j \\rangle} = e^{\\beta E_j}$\n\nThis gives the celebrated Bose-Einstein (or Planck, for photons) distribution for the equilibrium occupation number at energy $E$:\n$\\langle n(E) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta E} - 1}$, where the Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Mean Energy (U)**\n\nThe total mean energy $U$ is found by summing the energy of each state multiplied by its equilibrium occupation number. For a large volume $V$, the energy levels are quasi-continuous, and we can replace the sum with an integral over the density of states, $g(E)$. For photons (spin-1 massless particles), there are two polarization states, and the density of states is:\n$g(E) = \\frac{2V \\cdot 4\\pi p^2}{(2\\pi\\hbar)^3} \\frac{dp}{dE} = \\frac{V E^2}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3}$ (using $E=pc$)\n\nThe total energy is:\n$U = \\int_0^\\infty E \\cdot \\langle n(E) \\rangle \\cdot g(E) dE = \\int_0^\\infty E \\cdot \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta E} - 1} \\cdot \\frac{V E^2}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} dE$\n$U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{E^3}{e^{\\beta E} - 1} dE$\n\nTo solve the integral, we make the substitution $x = \\beta E$:\n$U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\nThe definite integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$. Substituting this value and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} (k_B T)^4 \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\nThis is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation.\n\n**5. Calculation of the Entropy (S)**\n\nWe can calculate the entropy using the thermodynamic relation involving the Helmholtz free energy $F = U - TS$. For photons ($\\mu=0$), the free energy is $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$, where $Z$ is the partition function. From the relation $U = -\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial \\beta}$, we can find $\\ln Z$ by integrating $U$:\n$U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} \\frac{1}{T^4} = \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{15 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^4}$\n$\\ln Z = -\\int U d\\beta = -\\frac{\\pi^2 V}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int \\beta^{-4} d\\beta = \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{45 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^3} + \\text{const.}$\nThe constant is zero from the third law of thermodynamics ($S \\to 0$ as $T \\to 0$).\nSo, $\\ln Z = \\frac{\\pi^2 V (k_B T)^3}{45 (\\hbar c)^3}$.\n\nNow we can find the entropy $S$:\n$S = \\frac{U-F}{T} = \\frac{U}{T} + k_B \\ln Z$\n$S = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4 \\right) + k_B \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V (k_B T)^3}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} \\right)$\n$S = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3 + \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n$S = \\left(\\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{45}\\right) \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4 T^3}{(\\hbar c)^3} = \\left(\\frac{3+1}{45}\\right) \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4 T^3}{(\\hbar c)^3}$\n$S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis using principles of large deviations which correspond to the maximization of the Bose-Einstein entropy, the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$ are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n$U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n$S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<**Mean Energy:** $U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\n**Entropy:** $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$>>>"
