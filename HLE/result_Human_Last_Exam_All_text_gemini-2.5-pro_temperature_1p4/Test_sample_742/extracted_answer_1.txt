No. It is not possible to prove the existence of GÃ¶del's god-like entities using the customary setting of the mathematics used for quantum mechanics. The two frameworks operate in completely different domains (physics vs. metaphysics) and use fundamentally incompatible languages and concepts. The mathematics of quantum mechanics lacks any tools to represent or reason about core concepts of the proof, such as "positive properties" or "necessary existence."
