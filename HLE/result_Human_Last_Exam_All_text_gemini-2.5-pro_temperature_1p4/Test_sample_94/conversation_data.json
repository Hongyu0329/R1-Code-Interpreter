    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question into Key Clues**\nThe question contains several distinct pieces of information that can be used to identify the physicist:\n1.  **A physicist:** The individual is a scientist specializing in physics.\n2.  **Better known for work in the microscopy field:** Their most significant contribution or fame lies in the area of microscopy.\n3.  **Discovered an optical effect:** The specific achievement was the discovery of a phenomenon related to light.\n4.  **Effect observed in real imagery:** The phenomenon was seen in an image formed by the actual convergence of light rays.\n5.  **Accidentally observed by a custodial worker:** This is a very specific and memorable detail about the origin of the discovery.\n6.  **The worker was cleaning concave mirrors:** This pinpoints the type of equipment involved in the initial observation.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues to a Specific Discovery**\n*   The combination of \"microscopy\" and a new \"optical effect\" points toward a major advancement that allows us to see things previously invisible. One of the most significant such discoveries in the 20th century was the ability to see transparent specimens, like living cells, without staining them.\n*   This method is known as **phase-contrast microscopy**. It works by converting phase shifts in light passing through a transparent specimen into brightness (amplitude) changes in the image.\n*   The \"concave mirror\" clue suggests the discovery might have originated in a field that uses such mirrors, like astronomy (telescopes) or spectroscopy (diffraction gratings are often concave).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Physicist Associated with the Discovery**\n*   The invention of the phase-contrast microscope is credited to the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**.\n*   He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 specifically for this invention, which confirms he is a \"physicist better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Anecdotal Detail**\n*   Now, we must check if the specific story about the custodial worker matches Frits Zernike.\n*   The popular account of Zernike's discovery aligns with the details in the question. The story often told is that Zernike was working with a concave diffraction grating (a type of ruled concave mirror used in spectroscopy).\n*   He was annoyed by faint \"ghost\" images caused by imperfections in the grating. The key insight was sparked when he (or a colleague) observed the strokes of a janitor cleaning the grating. The thin smudges left by the cleaning cloth were essentially invisible phase objects, yet their effect could be seen in the telescope's image plane under certain focus conditions.\n*   This accidental observation demonstrated how very slight variations in optical path length (a phase shift) could be made visible. This led Zernike to develop a systematic method—the phase-contrast method—to see similar transparent structures in a microscope.\n\n**Step 5: Final Synthesis**\nAll the clues point directly to one person:\n*   **Physicist?** Yes, Frits Zernike.\n*   **Famous for microscopy?** Yes, Nobel Prize for the phase-contrast microscope.\n*   **Discovered optical effect?** Yes, the phase-contrast principle.\n*   **Observed in real imagery with concave mirrors?** Yes, in the focal plane of a telescope/spectroscope looking at a concave grating.\n*   **Involving a custodial worker's cleaning?** Yes, this is the well-known (though perhaps embellished) story of his initial inspiration.\n\nTherefore, the physicist in question is Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
