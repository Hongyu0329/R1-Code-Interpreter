    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the left. It's a sequence of steps defined for each specific dance.\n*   **Overturn:** To rotate more than the standard amount prescribed for a specific figure. For example, if a standard turn is 3/4, an overturn might be 7/8 or a full rotation.\n*   **Disregarding the technique:** This means breaking the fundamental rules that define the dance and the specific figure. These rules include footwork (e.g., heel leads, toe leads, closing feet), rise and fall, sway, body contact, and the sequence of steps.\n*   **The Question's Constraint:** We are looking for a dance where the very technique of the reverse turn makes it *impossible* to add more rotation without fundamentally changing the figure and breaking its technical rules.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each dance option**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:**\n    *   **Technique:** Characterized by high speed and continuous, flowing rotation.\n    *   **Analysis:** While the speed and constant turning make it very difficult to significantly overturn a reverse turn without losing balance, timing, and flow, it is not strictly *impossible*. A slight overturn might be achievable, although it would be technically poor. The main issue with overturning is the disruption of the rhythm and continuous nature of the dance, rather than a specific technical rule about foot placement that forbids it.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):**\n    *   **Technique:** Characterized by rise and fall, sway, and flowing movements at a slow tempo.\n    *   **Analysis:** Overturning a reverse turn is not only possible but is a recognized and named variation in the syllabus (\"Overturned Reverse Turn\"). It is a common tool used by dancers to change alignment or navigate corners. Therefore, it does not disregard the technique; it's an extension of it.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:**\n    *   **Technique:** Characterized by staccato action, no rise and fall, and a compact hold. A key technical aspect of many Tango figures is the closing of the feet.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's look at the standard leader's steps for a Progressive Side Step Reverse Turn:\n        1.  Left Foot forward\n        2.  Right Foot to side\n        3.  **Left Foot closes to Right Foot**\n        4.  Right Foot back\n        5.  Left Foot to side and slightly forward\n        6.  **Right Foot closes to Left Foot**\n    *   The action of \"closing the feet\" on steps 3 and 6 is a defining part of the figure's technique. This action physically halts the rotation on that beat. To turn more (overturn), the dancer would have to avoid closing the feet and instead step past or cross. Doing so would mean they are no longer performing the defined steps of a Reverse Turn. It is a direct violation and alteration of the figure's fundamental construction. Thus, it is impossible to overturn this figure without disregarding its specific technique.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:**\n    *   **Technique:** Characterized by smooth, continuous, gliding movements.\n    *   **Analysis:** Similar to the English Waltz, overturning the reverse turn is a common variation (\"Overturned Reverse Turn with Feather Finish\"). It is a standard part of advanced choreography and technique, not a violation of it.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:**\n    *   **Technique:** A fast, dynamic dance with hops, chasses, and runs.\n    *   **Analysis:** Like the Waltz and Foxtrot, figures in Quickstep are frequently modified. Overturning a reverse turn is a possible variation used in choreography and does not inherently violate the dance's technique.\n\n**Step 3: Compare and Conclude**\n\nIn Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, overturning the reverse turn is a recognized variation and part of the advanced technique. In Viennese Waltz, it's extremely difficult and would disrupt the character of the dance, but it's not made impossible by a specific rule in the footwork itself.\n\nIn the European Tango, the technique of the Reverse Turn explicitly includes the action of closing the feet. This specific action mechanically prevents further rotation. To overturn the figure, one *must* break this rule, thus \"disregarding the technique.\" The impossibility is built directly into the definition of the figure's steps.\n\nTherefore, the European Tango is the only dance on the list where it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without fundamentally breaking the technique of that specific figure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
