    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Object of Analysis:** A Feynman diagram.\n2.  **Context:** Perturbative expansion of a Green's function in Quantum Field Theory.\n3.  **Diagram Specifications:**\n    *   **Two vertices:** The diagram has two points where interactions occur.\n    *   **Four field contractions:** These contractions correspond to internal lines (propagators) in the diagram. The problem implies these four contractions are between the two vertices.\n4.  **Goal:** Determine the symmetry factor (S) of this diagram.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Visualize the Diagram's Topology**\n\nThe description \"two vertices and four field contractions\" between them defines a unique connected diagram. Let's call the vertices V1 and V2. The four field contractions are four distinct propagators that all start at one vertex and end at the other.\n\nThe diagram looks like this:\n\n```\n      ----\n     /    \\\n V1 ====== V2\n     \\    /\n      ----\n```\nThis is a vacuum bubble diagram, sometimes called a \"setting-sun\" or \"sunrise\" type topology, but without the external legs.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Symmetry Factor**\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group. In simpler terms, it is the total number of ways the internal lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the overall structure (topology) of the diagram. It is crucial for correctly calculating the amplitude of the diagram, as it corrects for overcounting identical contributions that arise from the Wick expansion.\n\nWe can calculate S by identifying all possible symmetry operations and multiplying the number of ways each can be performed.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Sources of Symmetry**\n\nFor this specific diagram, there are two sources of symmetry:\n\n1.  **Permutation of Identical Vertices:** The two vertices (V1 and V2) arise from the same interaction term in the Lagrangian (e.g., from a `λφ^4` term). Therefore, they are identical.\n2.  **Permutation of Identical Lines:** The four lines connecting the vertices are propagators for the same field, making them identical.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Contribution from Each Symmetry**\n\n*   **Vertex Permutation:**\n    *   We have two identical vertices, V1 and V2.\n    *   We can swap the position of V1 and V2, and the diagram remains topologically identical (the four lines still connect the two points).\n    *   The number of ways to permute `n` identical objects is `n!`. Here, `n=2`.\n    *   Contribution from vertex symmetry = `2! = 2 * 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Line Permutation:**\n    *   We have four identical lines connecting V1 and V2.\n    *   We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way, and the diagram remains unchanged. For example, we can swap line 1 with line 3, and the diagram still shows two vertices connected by four lines.\n    *   The number of ways to permute `n` identical objects is `n!`. Here, `n=4`.\n    *   Contribution from line symmetry = `4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor**\n\nThe total symmetry factor S is the product of the contributions from all independent symmetry operations. The permutation of vertices is an independent operation from the permutation of the lines connecting them.\n\n*   `S = (Contribution from vertex permutations) × (Contribution from line permutations)`\n*   `S = 2! × 4!`\n*   `S = 2 × 24`\n*   `S = 48`\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Correctly interpreting the diagram:** The phrase \"four field contractions\" must be understood as four internal lines (propagators) connecting the two specified vertices.\n*   **Identifying all symmetries:** One must be careful not to miss any source of symmetry. For this diagram, vertex and line permutations are the only ones. There are no self-loops (tadpoles) where flipping the ends of a line would create a symmetry factor of 2.\n*   **Independence of operations:** It is important to recognize that the symmetries multiply because they are independent. You can first swap the vertices, and *then* you can still permute the four lines.\n*   **Verification (Optional but recommended):** This result can be verified by considering a specific theory, like `λφ^4`. The diagram would appear at the second order in the perturbation series, `(1/2!) (-iλ/4!)²`. The number of Wick contractions that form this specific topology is `4!`. The diagram's final amplitude is proportional to `(Number of contractions) / (Taylor series and vertex factors) = 4! / (2! * (4!)²) = 1 / (2 * 4!) = 1/48`. Since the amplitude is written as `(1/S) * (Integral)`, this confirms that `S = 48`.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the symmetry factor is calculated by multiplying the symmetry from swapping the two identical vertices (2!) and the symmetry from permuting the four identical lines between them (4!).\n\n`S = 2! × 4! = 2 × 24 = 48`\n\n<<<48>>>"
