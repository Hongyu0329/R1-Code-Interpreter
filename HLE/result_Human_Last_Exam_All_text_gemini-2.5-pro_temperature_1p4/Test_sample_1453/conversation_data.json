    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Coiled-Coil Structure and Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils consist of two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their sequences have a characteristic repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat. These seven positions are labeled `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`.\n\n*   **Positions `a` and `d`** are the most critical for determining the structure. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids (like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), Alanine (A), Methionine (M)). These residues form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack together.\n*   **Positions `e` and `g`** are often charged or polar residues (like Glutamate (E), Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Glutamine (Q)). They are located on the outside of the hydrophobic core and can form stabilizing salt bridges or hydrogen bonds between the helices.\n*   **Positions `b`, `c`, and `f`** are typically solvent-exposed and can be a variety of amino acid types.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to assign the `a-g` positions to this sequence. We'll look for a repeating pattern where hydrophobic residues consistently fall in the `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's test different alignments (registers). The most common method is to look for a pattern of `(hydrophobic)-x-x-(hydrophobic)`. A pattern of `A-x-x-L` seems very regular in the sequence. This suggests Alanine (A) could be at `a` and Leucine (L) could be at `d`.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis by assigning `A` to the `a` position. The first `A` is the 4th residue.\nIf `A` is `a`, then the preceding residue `I` is `g`, `E` is `f`, and `G` is `e`. This is a plausible flanking sequence.\n\nLet's map the entire sequence with this register (`e-f-g-a-b-c-d`):\n\n*   **Heptad 1:** `G(e) E(f) I(g) A(a) Q(b) S(c) L(d)`\n*   **Heptad 2:** `K(e) E(f) I(g) A(a) K(b) S(c) L(d)`\n*   **Heptad 3:** `K(e) E(f) I(g) A(a) W(b) S(c) L(d)`\n*   **Heptad 4:** `K(e) E(f) I(g) A(a) Q(b) S(c) L(d)`\n*   **End:** `K(e) G(f)`\n\nLet's summarize the residues at the critical core positions:\n*   **`a` positions:** A, A, A, A\n*   **`d` positions:** L, L, L, L\n\nThis alignment is very consistent and chemically sensible. The core is composed entirely of Alanine at the `a` position and Leucine at the `d` position.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Packing Efficiency (Knobs-into-Holes)**\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is determined by how efficiently the side chains from the `a` and `d` positions can pack together in the core (the \"knobs-into-holes\" principle). The relative size of the residues at the `a` and `d` positions is the primary determinant.\n\n*   **Core pattern:** `a` = Alanine (small side chain: -CH₃), `d` = Leucine (large side chain: -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂)\n\nLet's evaluate the packing for different oligomeric states:\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** The `a` residue of one helix packs against the `a` residue of the other (`a-a' interface`), and the `d` residue packs against `d'` (`d-d' interface`). An Ala-Ala interface and a Leu-Leu interface are both stable. A dimer is possible.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** The three `a` residues pack together in the center of the structure, and the three `d` residues also pack together at a different layer of the core. A core made of three small Alanine side chains would be \"under-packed,\" leaving an energetically unfavorable empty space or cavity in the center. Therefore, a trimer is very unlikely.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** In the common model for parallel tetramers, the four `a` residues form a central hydrophobic spine, and the four `d` residues pack against the grooves on the outside of this spine. A core made of four Alanine side chains (4 x -CH₃) is large enough to pack together tightly and efficiently without steric clashes or significant empty space. The large Leucine residues at the `d` position fit well into the larger spaces on the periphery of this central `a`-position core. This `a=small, d=large` pattern is a classic motif for forming a **tetramer**.\n*   **Pentamer (5 helices) and higher:** These structures require the helices to splay apart at a wider angle. This is achieved by having large residues at the `a` position and small residues at the `d` position (the reverse of our sequence's pattern). Therefore, pentamers or higher oligomers are highly unfavorable.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nComparing the possibilities, the trimer is unstable due to under-packing. Higher-order oligomers are disfavored by the `a=small, d=large` pattern. The contest is between a dimer and a tetramer. The specific `a=Ala, d=Leu` arrangement provides exceptionally stable packing in a tetrameric configuration, where the small `a` residues can form a tight central core. This arrangement is known from seminal studies on coiled-coil design to be a strong determinant for tetramerization.\n\nTherefore, the most likely oligomeric state for this protein sequence is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
