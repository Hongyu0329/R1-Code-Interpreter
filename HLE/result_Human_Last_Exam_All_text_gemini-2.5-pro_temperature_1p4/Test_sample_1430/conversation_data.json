    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n**1. Understand the problem's components**\n\n*   **C:** A genus `g=3` Riemann surface (a smooth projective algebraic curve over **C**).\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is the variety parametrizing effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi group NS(X):** The group of algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on X. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X), denoted ρ(X):** This is the rank of the Neron-Severi group, also known as the Picard number of X.\n\n**2. Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to the Jacobian of C**\n\nLet `J = Jac(C)` be the Jacobian of the curve C. The Jacobian is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g=3`. It parametrizes the line bundles of degree 0 on C.\n\nThere is a fundamental relationship between the geometry of the symmetric powers of a curve and its Jacobian. For `d > 2g - 2`, the `d`-th symmetric power `C^(d)` is a projective bundle over the Jacobian `J`.\nIn our case, `d = 15` and `g = 3`. The condition is `15 > 2*3 - 2 = 4`, which is satisfied.\n\nThis fibration structure leads to a precise relationship between their Picard groups and, consequently, their Neron-Severi groups. The key formula is:\n`ρ(C^(d)) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))`\nor\n`ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(J)`\n\nThis formula arises because the Picard group of the total space of a projective bundle `P(E) -> B` is given by `Pic(P(E)) ≅ p*Pic(B) ⊕ Z`, where the `Z` factor is generated by the relative hyperplane bundle. Taking ranks of the Neron-Severi groups (which are quotients of the Picard groups by their identity components) yields the formula `ρ(P(E)) = 1 + ρ(B)`.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(J) = ρ(Jac(C))` for a genus 3 curve C.\n\n**3. Determine the range of ρ(J)**\n\n`J` is a 3-dimensional abelian variety. For any such variety, the rank of its Neron-Severi group `ρ(J)` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^{1,1}(J)`.\n*   The polarization on `J` provides at least one non-trivial divisor class, so `ρ(J) >= 1`.\n*   The Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A)` for an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is `g^2`. For `J`, with `g=3`, we have `h^{1,1}(J) = 3^2 = 9`.\n*   Therefore, the possible range for `ρ(J)` is `1 <= ρ(J) <= 9`.\n\nWe now need to check if the extremal values, 1 and 9, are actually achievable for Jacobians of genus 3 curves.\n\n**4. Smallest possible rank**\n\nThe smallest possible rank `ρ(J) = 1` occurs for a \"generic\" curve.\n*   A generic curve `C` in the moduli space `M_3` has a Jacobian `J = Jac(C)` whose ring of endomorphisms is just the integers, `End(J) = Z`. Such Jacobians are called \"simple\" and have no complex multiplication.\n*   For such a generic Jacobian, it is a known (and deep) result that the Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n*   Therefore, `ρ(J) = 1` is attained for a generic genus 3 curve.\n*   This gives the smallest possible rank for `ρ(X)`:\n    `ρ(X)_{min} = 1 + ρ(J)_{min} = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**5. Largest possible rank**\n\nThe largest possible rank `ρ(J) = 9` is achieved when the Jacobian has the maximum number of independent divisor classes, which is related to having a large endomorphism ring (Complex Multiplication or CM).\n*   We need to find if there exists a genus 3 curve `C` such that `ρ(Jac(C)) = 9`.\n*   A sufficient condition for `ρ(J) = g^2` is that `J` is of CM-type and is isogenous to a product of `g` CM elliptic curves, `E^g`.\n*   Consider the Fermat curve of degree 4: `F_4: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`.\n    *   The genus of this curve is `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`.\n    *   It is a classical result that the Jacobian of this curve, `J(F_4)`, is isogenous to the cube of a specific elliptic curve: `J(F_4) ~ E^3`, where `E` is the elliptic curve `y^2 = x^3 - x`.\n    *   This elliptic curve `E` has Complex Multiplication by the ring of Gaussian integers `Z[i]`.\n*   The rank of the Neron-Severi group is an isogeny invariant. So, `ρ(J(F_4)) = ρ(E^3)`.\n*   For a product `E^g` where `E` is a CM elliptic curve, the rank of the Neron-Severi group is maximal: `ρ(E^g) = g^2`.\n*   For our case `g=3`, we have `ρ(E^3) = 3^2 = 9`.\n*   Thus, there exists a curve `C` (the Fermat curve `F_4`) for which `ρ(Jac(C)) = 9`.\n*   This gives the largest possible rank for `ρ(X)`:\n    `ρ(X)_{max} = 1 + ρ(J)_{max} = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of `J=Jac(C)` for a genus 3 curve `C` can range from a minimum of 1 (for a generic curve) to a maximum of 9 (for a special curve with CM, like the Fermat curve).\n\nUsing the formula `ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(J)`, we find:\n*   **Smallest rank of NS(X):** `1 + 1 = 2`\n*   **Largest rank of NS(X):** `1 + 9 = 10`\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
