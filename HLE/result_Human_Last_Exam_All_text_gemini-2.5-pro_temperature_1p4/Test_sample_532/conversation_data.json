    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** For finite groups, a group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n*   **Product-free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all `x, y` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), the product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S \\cap SS = \\emptyset`, where `SS = {xy | x, y \\in S}`.\n*   **Maximum by inclusion Product-free Set (Maximal PF set):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the set `S \\cup {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G`. In other words, every element of `G` belongs to at least one maximal product-free set.\n*   **Uncovered Set `I(G)`:** The set of elements in `G` that do not belong to any maximal product-free set. A group `G` is filled if and only if `I(G)` is empty.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the properties of product-free sets\n\nThe identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set `S`, because if `e \\in S`, then `e \\cdot e = e`, which would be in `S`. This contradicts the condition `S \\cap SS = \\emptyset`. Therefore, `e` can never be covered by a maximal product-free set in this straightforward interpretation.\n\nThis leads to a situation where `e \\in I(G)` for any group `G`, meaning no group could be filled. This suggests a subtlety in the definitions or the problem's interpretation. Common conventions in this area of mathematics lead to two main possibilities for resolving this:\n\n1.  **Interpretation 1: \"Fills G\" means covers all non-identity elements.** Under this interpretation, a group `G` is filled if `I(G) = \\{e\\}`.\n2.  **Interpretation 2: The definition of \"product-free\" is stricter.** Some sources define a set `S` as product-free if `SS \\cap (S \\cup \\{e\\}) = \\emptyset`. This means `SS` must not contain any element of `S`, and it must also not contain the identity `e`.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences of the second, stricter definition, as it resolves documented paradoxes in the literature (e.g., for the group `Z_6`).\n\n**Stricter Definition: `S` is product-free if `SS \\cap (S \\cup \\{e\\}) = \\emptyset`.**\n\n### Step 3: Identify which elements can never be in a product-free set\n\nUnder this stricter definition, let's see which elements can be part of a product-free set `S`.\nIf an element `g \\in S` has order 2, then `g \\cdot g = e`. This means `e \\in SS`, which violates the condition `SS \\cap (S \\cup \\{e\\}) = \\emptyset`.\nTherefore, **no element of order 2 can be in any product-free set**.\n\n### Step 4: Characterize filled groups based on this property\n\nIf a group `G` has an element `g \\neq e` of order 2, then this element `g` cannot be in any product-free set. Consequently, `g` cannot be in any maximal product-free set.\nThis means `g \\in I(G)`.\nFor `G` to be a filled group, it must be that `I(G)` is empty (or just `{e}` if we still treat `e` separately, but the conclusion is the same). In either case, `G` cannot contain any non-identity elements that are uncovered.\nSo, a filled group `G` cannot have any elements of order 2.\n\nBy Cauchy's Theorem for finite groups, a group has an element of order `p` for every prime `p` dividing the order of the group. If `G` has no element of order 2, then the prime 2 cannot divide the order of `G`.\nThis means **a finite filled group must have an odd order**.\n\n### Step 5: Check if the converse is true: Are all groups of odd order filled?\n\nLet `G` be a finite group of odd order. Let `g` be any non-identity element of `G`. We want to see if `g` belongs to some maximal product-free set. It is sufficient to show that `g` belongs to at least one product-free set.\n\nConsider the singleton set `S = {g}`.\nThe set of products is `SS = {g \\cdot g} = {g^2}`.\nFor `S` to be product-free under our strict definition, we need:\n1.  `S \\cap SS = \\emptyset` => `{g} \\cap {g^2} = \\emptyset` => `g \\neq g^2`. This is true for `g \\neq e`.\n2.  `e \\notin SS` => `e \\neq g^2`. Since `|G|` is odd, no element `g \\neq e` can have order 2. So `g^2 \\neq e`.\n\nBoth conditions hold for any non-identity element `g` in a group of odd order. Thus, `S = {g}` is a product-free set. Since any product-free set in a finite group can be extended to a maximal product-free set, `g` is contained in a maximal product-free set.\nThis is true for all `g \\in G \\setminus \\{e\\}`. If we consider the definition of filled to mean `I(G)=\\{e\\}`, then groups of odd order are filled.\n\nSo, a finite group `G` is a filled group if and only if it has an odd order.\n\n### Step 6: Apply the finding to finite nilpotent groups\n\nThe question asks for finite **nilpotent** filled groups.\nA finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. Let `G` be a nilpotent group, so `G \\cong P_1 \\times P_2 \\times \\dots \\times P_k`, where each `P_i` is the Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G`.\nThe order of `G` is `|G| = |P_1| \\cdot |P_2| \\cdot \\dots \\cdot |P_k|`.\n\nFor `G` to be a filled group, its order must be odd. This means that no prime factor `p_i` of `|G|` can be 2. Therefore, `G` cannot have a Sylow 2-subgroup (other than the trivial one).\nThis implies that a finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if its order is odd.\n\nThis condition is equivalent to stating that the group is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups for odd primes `p`.\n\nFinal conclusion: The finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the finite nilpotent groups of odd order.\n\n<<<The finite nilpotent groups of odd order.>>>"
