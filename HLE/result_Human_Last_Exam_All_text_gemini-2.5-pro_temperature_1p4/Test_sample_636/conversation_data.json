    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Goal**\nWe are given the system matrices:\nA = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]\nB = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]\n\nWe need to find a 2x2 state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nLet the feedback gain matrix be:\nF = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`.\nThe characteristic polynomial, `p(s)`, for a system with these eigenvalues is given by:\n`p(s) = (s - λ1)(s - λ2)`\n`p(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`p(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p(s) = (s^2 + 2s + 1) - (-1)`\n`p(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\nSo, the desired characteristic equation for the closed-loop system is `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Closed-Loop Matrix `A + BF`**\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n`BF = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]]`\n`BF = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, we form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\nThe characteristic polynomial for a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is `s^2 - trace(M)s + det(M)`.\nFor our closed-loop matrix `A_cl`:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) * f2 - (1 + f2 + 2*f4) * (1 + f1)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1*f2 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nSo, the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is:\n`p_cl(s) = s^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**Step 5: Equate the Coefficients of the Polynomials**\nWe match the coefficients of our calculated polynomial `p_cl(s)` with the desired polynomial `p(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n\n*   **Comparing the `s` coefficients:**\n    `-(f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1) = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1 = -2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1` (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Comparing the constant terms:**\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\n**Step 6: Solve for the Elements of F**\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This means the system is underdetermined and has infinite solutions. We can find one particular solution by simplifying the problem. A common approach is to set some of the elements of `F` to zero.\n\nLet's assume `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This simplifies the equations significantly.\n\n*   Equation 1 becomes:\n    `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1`\n    `f1 + f2 = -1`\n\n*   Equation 2 becomes:\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2(0) - 2(0) - 2*f1(0) = 3`\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations with two variables:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into the first equation:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nSo, one possible solution for the feedback gain matrix `F` is `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, and `f4 = 0`.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer**\nThe calculated state feedback gain matrix is:\nF = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]\n\n---\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Form of the Closed-Loop System:** The question specifies `A + BF`. The more common convention is `A - BF`. It's crucial to use the exact form given in the problem statement.\n2.  **MIMO System:** The system has two inputs (`u` is 2x1) and two states (`x` is 2x1). This makes it a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) system. For such systems, the feedback gain `F` that achieves a desired pole placement is generally not unique.\n3.  **Controllability:** Pole placement is only possible if the system is controllable. For this system, the controllability matrix `C = [B AB]` has a rank of 2, which is equal to the number of states, so the system is controllable, and a solution for `F` is guaranteed to exist.\n4.  **Solving Underdetermined Systems:** Since there are more unknowns than equations, we can assign values to some variables to find a specific solution. Setting some elements of `F` to zero is a valid and common strategy.\n5.  **Verification:** It is good practice to verify the answer. Plugging `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]` into `A + BF` gives `A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`. The characteristic equation is `det(sI - A_cl) = s(s+2) - (-1)(2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`, whose roots are indeed `-1 ± j`.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
