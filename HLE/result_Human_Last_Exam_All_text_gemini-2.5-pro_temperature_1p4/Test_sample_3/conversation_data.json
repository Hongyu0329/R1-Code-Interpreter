    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields, specifically quadratic fields.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the problem:** We are asked to find the maximum possible size (order) of a torsion subgroup $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, with the additional constraint that the subgroup must be non-cyclic.\n\n2.  **Recall the structure of torsion subgroups:** For any elliptic curve over a number field, the torsion subgroup is a finite abelian group. It is isomorphic to either a cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ or a product of two cyclic groups $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ with $n_1 | n_2$. The problem asks for the latter case, where $n_1 > 1$.\n\n3.  **Find the classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields:** While Mazur's Torsion Theorem classifies torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we need the more general result for quadratic number fields. The complete classification of possible torsion subgroups over any quadratic field was completed by the work of many mathematicians, culminating in the paper by Derickx, Etropolski, van Hoeij, Morrow, and Zureick-Brown (2017).\n\n4.  **Identify the possible torsion subgroups specifically for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** For the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the classification is a subset of the general list for all quadratic fields. The possible torsion subgroups $E(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}))_{\\text{tors}}$ are known to be:\n    *   **Cyclic groups:** $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 18\\}$.\n    *   **Non-cyclic groups:**\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\n5.  **List the non-cyclic groups and calculate their orders:** We are interested in the largest order of a non-cyclic group. Let's list all possible non-cyclic groups and their orders from the classification in the previous step.\n    *   From the family $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n        *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n        *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n        *   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n        *   $N=6$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $2 \\times 12 = 24$.\n    *   From the family $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n        *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n        *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\n6.  **Identify the largest order:** The set of possible orders for non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is $\\{4, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24\\}$. The largest value in this set is 24.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to use the classification theorem for the specific field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, not the general one for all quadratic fields, nor the one for $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The question specifically asks for non-cyclic subgroups. The largest order for a cyclic subgroup is 18, which is less than 24. The largest possible order overall for any torsion subgroup (cyclic or non-cyclic) over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is therefore 24.\n*   The existence of each of these groups has been computationally verified, meaning there exists an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ with that specific torsion subgroup.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the largest order is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
