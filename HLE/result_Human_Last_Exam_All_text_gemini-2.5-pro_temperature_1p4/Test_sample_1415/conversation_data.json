    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\n\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined recursively:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Recognizing the form of the integrand**\nThe integrand is of the form f'(x)/f(x). The antiderivative of this form is a well-known result from calculus.\nLet f(x) = F₃(x). Then the integral is ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx.\nThe antiderivative is ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx = ln|f(x)| + C.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nUsing the antiderivative, we can evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n**Careful Point 2: Checking the sign of F₃(x)**\nBefore removing the absolute value signs, we must check if F₃(x) is positive in the interval [0, 1].\n*   For any real x, -1 ≤ sin(x) ≤ 1.\n*   Therefore, e⁻¹ ≤ e^(sin(x)) ≤ e¹. This is always a positive value.\n*   This means 1 + e^(sin(x)) is always greater than 1 (specifically, it's greater than 1 + e⁻¹ ≈ 1.36).\n*   Since the argument of the logarithm, 1 + e^(sin(x)), is always greater than 1, its logarithm, F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))), will always be positive (since ln(y) > 0 for y > 1).\n*   Because F₃(x) is always positive, we can safely remove the absolute value signs:\n    V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n\n**Careful Point 3: Applying logarithm properties**\nUsing the property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we can write:\nV = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\n**To find F₃(0):**\n1.  F₀(0) = 0\n2.  F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n3.  F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n4.  F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n**To find F₃(1):**\n1.  F₀(1) = 1\n2.  F₁(1) = sin(1)  *(Careful Point 4: The argument is 1 radian, not 1 degree)*\n3.  F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n4.  F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the values back into the expression for V**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for F₃(1) and F₃(0) into the equation for V:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\n**Step 6: Perform the numerical calculation**\n\n**Careful Point 5: Using sufficient precision**\nWe need to use a calculator to find the numerical value of V.\n1.  sin(1 radian) ≈ 0.84147098\n2.  e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.3197771\n3.  F₃(1) = ln(1 + 2.3197771) = ln(3.3197771) ≈ 1.2000003\n4.  F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718\n5.  V = ln(1.2000003) - ln(0.69314718)\n    V ≈ 0.1823212 - (-0.3665129)\n    V ≈ 0.1823212 + 0.3665129\n    V ≈ 0.5488341\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final requested value**\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.5488341 = 5488.341\n\n**Careful Point 6: Finding the closest integer**\nThe closest integer to 5488.341 is found by standard rounding rules. Since the decimal part (0.341) is less than 0.5, we round down.\nThe closest integer is 5488."
