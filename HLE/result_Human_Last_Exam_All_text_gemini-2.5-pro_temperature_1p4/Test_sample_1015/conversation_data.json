    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n*   **Cambré:** A French ballet term meaning \"arched.\" It refers to a bend of the body from the waist, in any direction.\n*   **Derrière:** A French ballet term meaning \"back\" or \"behind.\"\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A bend backwards from the waist.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A highly structured and codified ballet training system developed by the Russian pedagogue Agrippina Vaganova. It is known for its precision, strength, and emphasis on core stability and clean lines.\n*   **Balanchine Method/Style:** A style of ballet developed by choreographer George Balanchine. While not a codified training system in the same way as Vaganova, it has a distinct aesthetic and technical approach characterized by speed, musicality, athleticism, and specific stylistic nuances.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Execution of a Cambré Derrière in the Vaganova Method**\n1.  **Core Principle:** The torso acts as a single, solid unit. The bend initiates from the upper back (thoracic spine).\n2.  **Hips:** The hips must remain absolutely square and facing forward (*en face*). There is no twisting or opening of the hips. The pelvis is kept stable over the supporting legs. This is a strict rule designed to build core strength and control.\n3.  **Initiation:** The movement begins with a lift upwards from the waist, creating space between the vertebrae before arching back.\n4.  **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, typically looking straight back. If an arm is in fifth position *en haut* (high fifth), the head looks back under that arm. The *port de bras* (carriage of the arms) is very specific and coordinated with the bend.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Execution of a Cambré Derrière in the Balanchine Method/Style**\n1.  **Core Principle:** The movement incorporates a subtle spiral or twist in the torso, creating a more dynamic and angular line.\n2.  **Hips:** This is the key point of difference. The Balanchine style allows (and often encourages) the hip of the working side to open slightly or press forward as the body bends back. This breaks the strict \"square hip\" rule of the Vaganova method.\n3.  **Effect:** This opening of the hip allows for a potentially deeper and more dramatic backbend. It changes the visual line from a pure arch to a sweeping spiral.\n4.  **Head and Arms:** The head often follows the spiral, looking back over the shoulder of the opening hip. The arms are often held in a more stylized manner to complement the angularity.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While arm placements differ stylistically between the two methods, it is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the *cambré derrière* itself. Both methods utilize various arm positions.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This directly addresses the core mechanical difference. Vaganova insists on square hips, while Balanchine allows the hip to open. This is the most significant and widely recognized distinction.\n*   **C. Speed:** The speed of a cambré is determined by the musicality of the exercise (*adagio*, or slow movement), not by the training method itself. While Balanchine's choreography is often fast, the training of a cambré is not inherently faster.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The opening of the hip in the Balanchine style can *facilitate* a deeper backbend, but the \"degree\" is a result, not the cause, of the technical difference. Dancers in both styles can achieve very deep backbends; they just use different techniques to get there. Therefore, hip placement is a more primary difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement is a consequence of the torso and hip action. In Vaganova, it follows the spine. In Balanchine, it follows the spiral. Since the hip action dictates the spiral, the hip placement is the more fundamental difference.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most defining technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the treatment of the hips. Vaganova requires them to be square, while Balanchine incorporates an open hip.\n\n<<<B>>>"
