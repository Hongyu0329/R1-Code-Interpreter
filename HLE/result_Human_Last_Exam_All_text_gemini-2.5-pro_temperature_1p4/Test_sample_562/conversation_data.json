    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the kanji 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Kanji**\nThe first step is to break down the character 謄 into its constituent parts. The kanji 謄 has a clear left-right structure.\n*   The left part is: **言**\n*   The right part is: **朕**\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese kanji with a left-right structure (known as a *hen-tsukuri* structure), the left-hand component (*hen*) is very often the radical, as it typically provides the semantic category for the character. The right-hand component (*tsukuri*) usually provides the phonetic information.\nIn this case, the left part is **言**, which means \"speech\" or \"to say\". This is a very common radical. The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"transcribe,\" which is an action related to words and language. Therefore, **言** is the correct radical for 謄.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nNow that we have identified the radical as 言, we need to find its specific name. Radicals in Japanese often have special names, which can change depending on their position within the character.\n*   The radical character itself is **言**.\n*   Its position is on the left side, which is called **hen (へん)**.\n*   The common name for the 言 radical when it appears on the left is **\"gonben\" (ごんべん)**. The \"gon\" is a reading of 言, and \"ben\" is the voiced version of \"hen\" (this sound change, called *rendaku*, is common in Japanese compounds).\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn**\nThe final step is to write the name of the radical using Hepburn romanization, as requested by the prompt's example (\"Onnahen\").\n*   The Japanese name is: **ごんべん**\n*   The Hepburn transcription is: **Gonben**\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Structure Recognition:** Correctly identifying the character's structure (left-right) is crucial. Misinterpreting it as top-bottom would lead to an incorrect radical.\n2.  **Radical vs. Phonetic Component:** It is important to distinguish between the radical (semantic key) and the phonetic component. Here, 言 is the semantic key (radical), and 朕 is the phonetic component.\n3.  **Positional Names:** The name of the radical is position-dependent. While 言 as a standalone radical is \"gen\" or \"kotoba,\" its name as a left-side component is \"Gonben\".\n4.  **Transcription:** The Hepburn system must be used correctly (e.g., べん becomes \"ben\", not \"ven\"). \"Gonben\" is the standard transcription for ごんべん.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine that the radical of 謄 is 言, and its standard name in Hepburn transcription is Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
