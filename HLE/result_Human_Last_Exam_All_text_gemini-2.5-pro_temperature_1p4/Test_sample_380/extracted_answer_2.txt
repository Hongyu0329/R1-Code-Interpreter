The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial; it follows the Parker spiral, typically making an angle of about 45 degrees with the radial direction. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z) to calculate helicity is a common and justified simplification based on **Taylor's "frozen-in" flow hypothesis**. According to this hypothesis, the solar wind plasma, along with the embedded magnetic field and waves, is convected past the stationary L1 spacecraft at high speed, almost purely in the radial direction. This radial convection is the dominant effect observed by the instrument. Therefore, analyzing the data in a coordinate system aligned with this radial flow is a practical approach. While this is an approximation (a more precise method involves Minimum Variance Analysis), it is often valid for determining the wave polarization, especially when the magnetic field is nearly aligned with the radial direction ("quasi-parallel" conditions) or for large statistical studies.
