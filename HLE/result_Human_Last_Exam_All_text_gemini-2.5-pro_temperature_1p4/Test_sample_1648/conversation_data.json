    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest natural number n such that the $(2n)$th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object of study**\nWe need to analyze the algebraic K-groups $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$. The ring in question is $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, which is of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ with the prime $p=3$ and the exponent $k=3$. The K-groups $K_m(R)$ are a sequence of abelian groups associated with a ring $R$. We are interested in the even-indexed groups $K_{2n}$ for natural numbers $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the vanishing range for the K-groups**\nFor rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$, the K-groups are known to be zero for sufficiently high indices. A fundamental result by Hesselholt and Madsen, a cornerstone of modern K-theory computations, provides a precise vanishing line.\n*   **Theorem (Hesselholt-Madsen):** For an odd prime $p$ and an integer $k \\ge 1$, the algebraic K-groups $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ are zero for all $m > 2k-1$.\n\nIn our specific case, $p=3$ and $k=3$. The vanishing line is therefore at degree $m > 2(3)-1 = 5$. This means:\n$K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = 0$ for all $m > 5$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the vanishing result to the problem**\nWe are looking for the largest natural number $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$. According to the vanishing theorem, we must have $2n \\le 5$. Since $n$ is a natural number, the possible values for $n$ are constrained:\n$n \\le 5/2 = 2.5$.\nSo, the only possible natural numbers $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ could be nonzero are $n=1$ and $n=2$. To find the largest such $n$, we need to check if $K_{2 \\cdot 2}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the K-groups within the non-vanishing range**\nThe same work by Hesselholt and Madsen provides formulas for the K-groups in the \"stable range\", which for our purposes is the range $m < 2k-1=5$. Our group of interest, $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$, is in this range since $4 < 5$.\n\nThe computation of $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ for $m>0$ splits into two parts: the $p$-primary component and the prime-to-$p$ component.\n\n*   **Prime-to-$p$ component:** For any prime $\\ell \\neq p$, the $\\ell$-primary part of $K_m(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is isomorphic to the $\\ell$-primary part of $K_m(\\mathbb{F}_p)$. For even indices $m=2n > 0$, the K-groups of a finite field are zero: $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_p) = 0$. Therefore, the prime-to-3 component of $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero. This means $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is a 3-primary group.\n\n*   **$p$-primary component:** For the stable range $m < 2k-1$, Hesselholt and Madsen provide the following formula for the $p$-primary part of the even K-groups:\n    $K_{2i-2}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)_{(p)} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(i)}$ for $i \\ge 1$.\n    Here, $v_p(i)$ is the $p$-adic valuation of $i$ (the exponent of the highest power of $p$ that divides $i$).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$**\nWe want to compute $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$. We set the formula index $2i-2$ equal to 4:\n$2i-2 = 4 \\implies 2i=6 \\implies i=3$.\n\nNow we apply the formula with $p=3$, $k=3$, and $i=3$:\n$K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3^{v_3(3)}$.\n\nThe 3-adic valuation of 3 is $v_3(3)=1$. So,\n$K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3^1 = \\mathbb{Z}/3$.\n\nSince the 3-primary component of $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/3$, and the prime-to-3 component is zero, we have $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3$.\nThis group is nonzero. Therefore, for $n=2$, the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the final answer**\nWe have found that:\n*   For $n=2$, $K_4(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\n*   For any $n > 2$ (e.g., $n=3, 4, \\ldots$), the index $2n$ will be greater than 5 (e.g., $6, 8, \\ldots$). By the vanishing theorem, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)=0$ for all $n>2$.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero is 2.\n\n(For completeness, for $n=1$, $K_2(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is known to be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2$, so it is also nonzero. The set of natural numbers $n$ for which the group is nonzero is $\\{1, 2\\}$, and the largest is 2.)\n\n<<<2>>>"
