    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the structure of the generalized quaternion group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order `2^n`, denoted `Q_{2^n}`, has the presentation:\n`Q_{2^n} = <x, y | x^(2^(n-1)) = 1, y^2 = x^(2^(n-2)), yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹>`\n\nFor the group of size 128, we have `2^n = 128`, which means `n = 7`.\nSo, the group in question is `G = Q_{128}` with the presentation:\n`G = <x, y | x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹>`\n\nThe group `G` consists of two types of elements:\n1.  Elements of the cyclic subgroup `<x>`, which has order 64. These are of the form `x^k` for `0 ≤ k < 64`.\n2.  Elements in the coset `y<x>`, which are of the form `yx^k` for `0 ≤ k < 64`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup `H` of a group `G` is a power subgroup if there exists an integer `m` such that `H` is the set of all `m`-th powers of elements in `G`. This is denoted as `H = G^m = {g^m | g ∈ G}`.\n\nTo find the number of power subgroups, we must compute the set `G^m` for various integers `m` and count how many distinct subgroups we get.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the m-th powers of elements in G**\n\nWe need to calculate `g^m` for `g = x^k` and `g = yx^k`.\n\n*   **For elements `g = x^k`:**\n    `g^m = (x^k)^m = x^(km)`.\n    The set of all such powers is `{(x^k)^m | 0 ≤ k < 64} = {x^(km) | 0 ≤ k < 64}`. This set forms the subgroup `<x^m>`, which is equal to `<x^d>` where `d = gcd(m, 64)`.\n\n*   **For elements `g = yx^k`:**\n    First, let's find the order of these elements.\n    `(yx^k)^2 = yx^k yx^k = y(x^k y)x^k = y(yx⁻k)x^k = y^2 x⁻k x^k = y^2 = x^32`.\n    The order of `x^32` is `64/32 = 2`.\n    So, `(yx^k)^4 = ((yx^k)^2)^2 = (x^32)^2 = x^64 = 1`.\n    The order of any element `yx^k` is 4. This is a crucial point.\n\n    Since `o(yx^k) = 4`, the `m`-th power `(yx^k)^m` depends on `m mod 4`.\n    *   If `m ≡ 0 (mod 4)`: `(yx^k)^m = 1`.\n    *   If `m ≡ 1 (mod 4)`: `(yx^k)^m = yx^k`.\n    *   If `m ≡ 2 (mod 4)`: `(yx^k)^m = (yx^k)^2 = x^32`.\n    *   If `m ≡ 3 (mod 4)`: `(yx^k)^m = (yx^k)^3 = (yx^k)⁻¹ = x⁻k y⁻¹ = x⁻k (yx⁻³²) = yx^k x⁻³² = yx^(k-32)`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the set G^m for different m**\n\n`G^m` is the union of the sets of `m`-th powers of both types of elements.\nLet's analyze `G^m` based on `m mod 4`.\n\n*   **Case 1: `m` is odd (`m ≡ 1` or `3 mod 4`)**\n    `d = gcd(m, 64) = 1` because `m` is odd. The subgroup generated by powers of `x` is `<x^1> = <x>`.\n    The powers of elements `yx^k` result in the set `y<x>`.\n    So, `G^m = <x> ∪ y<x> = G`.\n    This gives us one power subgroup: `G` itself.\n\n*   **Case 2: `m ≡ 2 (mod 4)`**\n    `m` can be written as `m = 2(2j+1)` for some integer `j`.\n    `d = gcd(m, 64) = gcd(2(2j+1), 64) = 2 * gcd(2j+1, 32) = 2`.\n    The subgroup from powers of `x` is `<x^2>`.\n    The powers of elements `yx^k` are all `x^32`.\n    So, `G^m = <x^2> ∪ {x^32}`. Since `x^32 = (x^2)^16`, the element `x^32` is already in `<x^2>`.\n    Thus, `G^m = <x^2>`.\n    This gives us a second, distinct power subgroup: `<x^2>`.\n\n*   **Case 3: `m ≡ 0 (mod 4)`**\n    The powers of elements `yx^k` are all `1`.\n    The subgroup from powers of `x` is `<x^d>` where `d = gcd(m, 64)`.\n    So, `G^m = <x^d> ∪ {1} = <x^d>`.\n    Since `m` is a multiple of 4, `d = gcd(m, 64)` must also be a multiple of 4. The divisors of 64 are `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64`. The ones that are multiples of 4 are `4, 8, 16, 32, 64`.\n    We can obtain each of these as a `d = gcd(m, 64)` by choosing `m=d`.\n    *   `m = 4`: `G^4 = <x^4>`.\n    *   `m = 8`: `G^8 = <x^8>`.\n    *   `m = 16`: `G^16 = <x^{16}>`.\n    *   `m = 32`: `G^32 = <x^{32}>`. (This subgroup is the center Z(G)).\n    *   `m = 64`: `G^64 = <x^{64}> = {1}`. (The trivial subgroup).\n    This gives us five more distinct power subgroups.\n\n**Step 5: Count the distinct power subgroups**\n\nBy collecting all the distinct subgroups found in the cases above, we get the following list of power subgroups of `Q_{128}`:\n1.  `G` (the whole group)\n2.  `<x^2>` (order 32)\n3.  `<x^4>` (order 16)\n4.  `<x^8>` (order 8)\n5.  `<x^{16}>` (order 4)\n6.  `<x^{32}>` (order 2)\n7.  `{1}` (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nThese are 7 distinct subgroups.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128."
