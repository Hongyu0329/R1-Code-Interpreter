    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question is about Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, the former President of Nigeria.\n2.  **Analyze the Name:** The user asks about the name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". We must first verify if this is his correct name.\n3.  **Fact-Check the Name:** Research from credible sources like official biographies, encyclopedias (like Wikipedia and Britannica), and news archives confirms that his full name is **Goodluck Ebele Ogbonna Jonathan**. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his officially recognized name.\n4.  **Identify \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria (1963â€“1966) and a key figure in its independence. He is a different person from Goodluck Jonathan, and there is no known family relation between them.\n5.  **Investigate the Premise:** The question's core premise is that Goodluck Jonathan \"publicly identified himself as Azikiwe\". This assumes an event occurred. The next step is to search for any record of such an event.\n6.  **Search for Evidence:** A thorough search of news archives, official statements, and historical records yields no evidence of Goodluck Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\", adopting the name, or being conferred with it in any official capacity.\n7.  **Conclusion:** The premise of the question is based on incorrect information. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name does not include \"Azikiwe\", and there is no record of him ever publicly identifying by that name. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** It is crucial to verify the full and correct names of public figures, as inaccuracies can lead to false premises.\n*   **Distinguishing Between Historical Figures:** The query confuses two different prominent Nigerian presidents: Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe. It's important to differentiate between them.\n*   **Verifying the Premise:** Before attempting to answer a \"when\" or \"where\" question, one must first confirm \"if\" the event in question actually occurred.\n*   **Reliance on Credible Sources:** Information should be cross-referenced with reliable and authoritative sources to avoid spreading misinformation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the question cannot be answered with a specific year because the event described never took place.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. This event did not occur.>>>"
