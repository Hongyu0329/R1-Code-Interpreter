    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the historically latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to identify which of Lady Butler's paintings portrays a battle or military event that happened most recently in history. This is about the date of the event itself, not the date the painting was created.\n\n**Step 2: List Major Battle Paintings by Lady Butler and their Subjects**\nWe need to compile a list of Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler's prominent works that depict specific historical battles or military engagements.\n\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo.\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Shows a British infantry square at the Battle of Quatre Bras.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Shows the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Heavy Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, also in the Crimean War.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Portrays the defense of the mission station at Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882): Depicts an incident during the Battle of Laing's Nek in the First Boer War.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): Shows the Highland Brigade at the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n*   ***A Boer War Lament*** (painted c. 1900): A more allegorical piece representing the sorrows of the Second Boer War.\n*   ***The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia*** (painted 1917): Depicts a specific cavalry charge during the First World War.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Historical Date of Each Battle**\nNow, let's find the date for each of the events listed above.\n\n*   **Battle of Waterloo:** June 18, **1815** (Napoleonic Wars)\n*   **Battle of Quatre Bras:** June 16, **1815** (Napoleonic Wars)\n*   **Battle of Inkerman:** November 5, **1854** (Crimean War)\n*   **Battle of Balaclava:** October 25, **1854** (Crimean War)\n*   **Battle of Rorke's Drift:** January 22–23, **1879** (Anglo-Zulu War)\n*   **Battle of Laing's Nek:** January 28, **1881** (First Boer War)\n*   **Battle of Tel El Kebir:** September 13, **1882** (Anglo-Egyptian War)\n*   **Second Boer War:** **1899–1902**\n*   **Battle of Agagia:** February 26, **1916** (First World War, Senussi Campaign)\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Dates and Identify the Latest Battle**\nLet's list the dates in chronological order to find the latest one:\n1.  1815 (Waterloo, Quatre Bras)\n2.  1854 (Inkerman, Balaclava)\n3.  1879 (Rorke's Drift)\n4.  1881 (Laing's Nek)\n5.  1882 (Tel El Kebir)\n6.  1899–1902 (Second Boer War)\n7.  **1916** (Battle of Agagia)\n\nThe comparison clearly shows that the Battle of Agagia, which took place in 1916 during the First World War, is the latest historical event depicted among these paintings.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Historical Date vs. Painting Date:** It is critical to focus on the year the battle occurred, not the year Lady Butler finished the painting. For example, *Scotland for Ever!* was painted in 1881, but the battle it depicts was in 1815. *The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia* was painted in 1917, just one year after the 1916 battle it portrays.\n*   **Comprehensive Search:** While Lady Butler is most famous for her Victorian-era battle scenes, she did live until 1933 and painted events from the First World War. It's important to look beyond her most iconic works.\n*   **Specificity of the Event:** Paintings like *A Boer War Lament* represent a conflict (1899-1902) rather than a single dated battle. However, even the end date of that war (1902) is earlier than the Battle of Agagia (1916).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the historical dates of the events shown in Lady Butler's paintings, the latest battle is the **Battle of Agagia**, fought on February 26, 1916, as depicted in her 1917 painting, *The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia*.\n\n<<<The Battle of Agagia"
