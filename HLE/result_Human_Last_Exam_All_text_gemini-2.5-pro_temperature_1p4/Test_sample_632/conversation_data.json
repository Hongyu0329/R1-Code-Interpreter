    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon church is located there.\n    *   **Object of Inquiry:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n    *   **Timeframe:** In 1950.\n\n2.  **Identify Permanent Features of the Square:**\n    *   The **Pantheon** itself is the main building. It was not removed.\n    *   The **Fontana del Pantheon** (Fountain of the Pantheon) is in the center of the square. The fountain itself, designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1575, was not removed.\n    *   The **Macuteo Obelisk**, an ancient Egyptian obelisk, sits on top of the fountain. It was added in 1711 and has not been removed.\n\n3.  **Consider Other Historical Changes (and rule them out):**\n    *   The so-called \"donkey's ears\" (**i campanili dell'asino**), two bell towers added by the architect Bernini to the Pantheon's facade, were a famous feature. However, they were widely disliked and were removed much earlier, in 1883. Therefore, this does not fit the 1950 timeline.\n    *   For centuries, the square hosted a bustling **market**, particularly for fish and vegetables. This was gradually cleared out for reasons of \"public decorum\" in the late 19th century, not as late as 1950.\n\n4.  **Focus on the Mid-20th Century (around 1950):**\n    *   The period after World War II was a time of significant modernization and change in many European cities, including Rome.\n    *   A key aspect of this modernization was the overhaul of public transportation systems. Many cities began phasing out older tram networks in historic centers to make way for buses and increased car traffic.\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Feature:**\n    *   Historical photographs from the first half of the 20th century show a very prominent feature in the Piazza della Rotonda: **tram tracks**.\n    *   This was not just a simple track passing through. It was a **circular tramway track that formed a ring around the central fountain**. Trams would loop around the fountain, making it a terminus or a key junction point.\n    *   The tracks embedded in the cobblestones, along with the associated overhead electrical wires, were a defining, and visually intrusive, feature of the square for decades.\n\n6.  **Confirm the Removal:**\n    *   The city administration of Rome decided to remove the tram lines from the historic center to improve traffic flow and restore the historical appearance of its famous piazzas.\n    *   The circular track in the Piazza della Rotonda was dismantled as part of this city-wide project. The specific year 1950 aligns with this period of tramway decommissioning in central Rome.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Architectural Feature\":** While tram tracks are primarily transportation infrastructure, their permanent, physical integration into the square's design (a metal ring shaping the space and movement) allows them to be described as a feature of the square's built environment or urban architecture.\n*   **Uniqueness:** A tram line looping completely around a monumental Renaissance fountain is indeed a very unique and unusual configuration, making it a notable feature.\n*   **Timeline:** The 1950 date is the critical clue that points away from earlier changes (like the removal of Bernini's bell towers or the market) and directly towards post-war modernization projects like the removal of the tram system.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe unique feature present in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal around 1950 was the circular tramway track that looped around the central fountain.\n\n<<<A circular tramway track that looped around the central fountain>>>"
