    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and the Wavefunction**\n\n*   The system is a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, commonly known as a particle in a box.\n*   The box has a length `a`, extending from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a given energy state `n` is:\n    `ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n*   We are interested in the state `n = 2`. So, the wavefunction for this particle is:\n    `ψ2(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)`\n\n**2. Determine the Probability Density**\n\n*   The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the probability density function, `P(x)`, which is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    `P(x) = |ψ2(x)|^2 = (sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx/a))^2`\n*   This simplifies to:\n    `P(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a)`\n\n**3. Set up the Probability Integral**\n\n*   The probability of finding the particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is the integral of the probability density over that interval.\n*   The given interval is from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n*   The probability `P` is given by the integral:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a) dx`\n\n**4. Analyze the Interval and the Integrand (Careful Points)**\n\n*   **Point 1: Location of the Interval:** The interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is centered at `x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`.\n*   **Point 2: Node Location:** For the `n=2` state, the wavefunction has a node (a point where the wavefunction and probability density are zero) at the center of the box, `x = a/2`.\n*   **Point 3: Small Interval:** The width of the interval is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`, which is very small compared to the length of the box `a`.\n*   **Point 4: Approximation Strategy:** Since the interval is very small and centered on a node where the probability density is zero, the total probability will be very small. A simple approximation like `P ≈ P(0.5a) * Δx` would incorrectly yield zero. We must perform a more careful calculation. We will use a Taylor series approximation for the integrand, which is very accurate for small intervals.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation using an Approximation**\n\n*   We can expand the probability density function `P(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a)` in a Taylor series around the center of the interval, `x = a/2`.\n*   Let `x = a/2 + u`, where `u` is a small displacement. The new integration limits for `u` are from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n*   Substitute `x = a/2 + u` into the `sin^2` term:\n    `sin^2(2π(a/2 + u)/a) = sin^2(π + 2πu/a)`\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ)`, we get:\n    `sin^2(π + 2πu/a) = [-sin(2πu/a)]^2 = sin^2(2πu/a)`\n*   The integrand becomes `(2/a) * sin^2(2πu/a)`.\n*   For small `u`, the argument of the sine function `y = 2πu/a` is small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(y) ≈ y`.\n    `sin^2(2πu/a) ≈ (2πu/a)^2 = 4π^2u^2/a^2`\n*   Our approximate integrand is now:\n    `P(u) ≈ (2/a) * (4π^2u^2/a^2) = (8π^2/a^3) * u^2`\n\n**6. Integrate the Approximated Function**\n\n*   Now we integrate this simplified polynomial over the new limits for `u`:\n    `P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (8π^2/a^3) * u^2 du`\n*   The constant `(8π^2/a^3)` can be pulled out of the integral:\n    `P ≈ (8π^2/a^3) * ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] u^2 du`\n*   The integral of `u^2` is `u^3/3`:\n    `P ≈ (8π^2/a^3) * [u^3/3] |_[from -0.005a to +0.005a]`\n*   Evaluate at the limits:\n    `P ≈ (8π^2/(3a^3)) * [(0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3]`\n    `P ≈ (8π^2/(3a^3)) * [2 * (0.005a)^3]`\n*   The `a^3` terms cancel out:\n    `P ≈ (16π^2/3) * (0.005)^3`\n\n**7. Acquire the Final Numerical Answer**\n\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    `P ≈ (16π^2/3) * (5 × 10^-3)^3`\n    `P ≈ (16π^2/3) * (125 × 10^-9)`\n    `P ≈ (2000π^2/3) × 10^-9`\n*   Using `π ≈ 3.14159`, we get `π^2 ≈ 9.8696`.\n    `P ≈ (2000 * 9.8696 / 3) × 10^-9`\n    `P ≈ (19739.2 / 3) × 10^-9`\n    `P ≈ 6579.7 × 10^-9`\n*   This can be written in standard scientific notation as:\n    `P ≈ 6.58 × 10^-6`\n\nThis value represents the probability of finding the particle in the state `n=2` within the small interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
