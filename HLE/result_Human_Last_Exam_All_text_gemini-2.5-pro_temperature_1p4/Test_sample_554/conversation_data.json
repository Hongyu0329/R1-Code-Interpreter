    "This question asks for the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical molecule called \"perfluoronanocar\". To answer this, we need to determine the chemical structure of a \"nanocar\" and then apply the chemical definition of the \"perfluoro-\" prefix.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the name \"perfluoronanocar\"**\n\n*   **Nanocar**: This is not a formal IUPAC name but a colloquial term used in nanotechnology to describe a single-molecule machine that resembles a car. Several different \"nanocar\" molecules have been synthesized. We must select a common, representative structure for our analysis. The most iconic nanocars, developed by the research group of Professor James Tour, feature an organic chassis with four fullerene (buckyball) wheels.\n*   **Perfluoro-**: This is a standard chemical prefix. It means that **all** hydrogen atoms on the parent organic framework are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\n**Careful Point:** The exact number depends on which nanocar structure is chosen. The most logical approach is to use the most common or original design concept. We will base our analysis on a representative nanocar with an H-shaped chassis and four C60 fullerene wheels.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the chemical structure of the parent nanocar**\n\n*   **Chassis**: A common and representative chassis is based on the molecule `1,2,4,5-tetrakis(phenylethynyl)benzene`. This structure consists of a central benzene ring connected to four phenyl groups via ethynyl (`-C≡C-`) linkers.\n*   **Wheels**: The \"wheels\" are typically C60 fullerene molecules. C60 is an allotrope of carbon and has the formula C60.\n\n**Step 3: Count the hydrogen atoms in the parent nanocar structure**\n\nThe number of fluorine atoms in the \"perfluoronanocar\" will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in its parent structure.\n\n1.  **Hydrogen atoms on the Chassis (`1,2,4,5-tetrakis(phenylethynyl)benzene`):**\n    *   **Central Benzene Ring**: The central ring is substituted at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. This leaves the hydrogen atoms at positions 3 and 6 untouched. That's **2 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   **Phenylethynyl Arms**: There are four identical `phenylethynyl` (`-C≡C-C6H5`) groups. Each terminal phenyl group (`C6H5`) contains **5 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   Since there are four arms, the total number of hydrogens on these groups is 4 × 5 = **20 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   The total count for the chassis is 2 + 20 = **22 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n2.  **Hydrogen atoms on the Wheels (C60 Fullerene):**\n    *   A C60 fullerene molecule is composed solely of carbon atoms. It contains **0 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n3.  **Total Hydrogens in the Molecule:**\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the entire parent nanocar molecule is the sum of hydrogens on the chassis and the wheels: 22 + 0 = **22 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly count all hydrogens on the aromatic rings of the chassis and to remember that the C60 fullerene wheels contain no hydrogen atoms to be replaced.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of fluorine atoms**\n\nFollowing the definition of the \"perfluoro-\" prefix, we replace every hydrogen atom in the parent molecule with a fluorine atom.\n\n*   Number of hydrogens to replace = 22\n*   Number of fluorine atoms in perfluoronanocar = 22\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nA hypothetical perfluoronanocar, based on a common representative structure, would have all its hydrogen atoms on the organic chassis replaced by fluorine atoms. The fullerene wheels would remain unchanged. Therefore, the molecule would contain 22 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<22>>>"
