    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the given algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Purpose:** The algorithm takes an integer `n` and a base `c` and converts `n` into its base-`c` representation. It does this by repeatedly finding the remainder and quotient of `n` divided by `c`. The remainders form the digits of the new base representation, from least significant to most significant.\n\n2.  **Identify Basic Operations:** The algorithm uses a set of fundamental operations:\n    *   Assignment (`:=`)\n    *   Arithmetic operations: division (`/`), multiplication (`*`), subtraction (`-`)\n    *   Comparison (`>`)\n    *   Integer part/floor function (`⌊...⌋`)\n\n    In standard computational analysis, we assume these basic operations take a constant amount of time, denoted as `O(1)`, provided the numbers involved (`n`, `x`, `q`) can fit into a single machine word (e.g., a 64-bit integer).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Code Structure:** The algorithm consists of two main parts:\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):** This part executes only once before the loop begins. It involves a few assignment and arithmetic operations. The time taken for this step is constant, `O(1)`.\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):** This is the core of the algorithm. Its total execution time depends on two factors:\n        a. The number of operations inside the loop per iteration.\n        b. The total number of times the loop iterates.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Cost per Loop Iteration:** Let's examine the operations inside the `while` loop (step 2.1):\n    *   `i := i + 1`: One addition and one assignment.\n    *   `x := q`: One assignment.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One division and one assignment.\n    *   `a_{i} := x — qc`: One multiplication, one subtraction, and one assignment.\n\n    Each of these is a basic operation. Therefore, the total work done inside a single iteration of the loop is a constant amount. The time complexity for one iteration is `O(1)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:** This is the most critical part of the analysis.\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   Let's trace the value that gets divided. Initially, `x = n`.\n    *   Before the loop, the first quotient is `q = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   In the first iteration of the loop, `x` becomes this `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   In the second iteration, the new `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   After `k` iterations of the loop, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    *   The loop terminates when this `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which is equivalent to `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   To find the number of iterations `k`, we can solve for `k`:\n        `log_c(n) < k + 1`\n        `k > log_c(n) - 1`\n    *   This means the number of iterations `k` is roughly proportional to `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. The number of digits in the base-c representation of `n` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The loop runs once for each digit except the first one (`a_0`), so it runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Time Complexity:** The total time complexity is the sum of the time for the initialization part and the time for the loop.\n    *   `Total Time = (Time for Initialization) + (Number of Iterations) * (Time per Iteration)`\n    *   `T(n) = O(1) + (⌊log_c(n)⌋) * O(1)`\n    *   `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n))`\n    *   For large values of `n`, the `O(log_c(n))` term dominates the constant `O(1)` term.\n    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n7.  **Final Simplification:** In Big O notation, the base of a logarithm is considered a constant factor and can be omitted (`log_c(n) = log(n)/log(c)`), as it does not affect the growth rate. Thus, the complexity is commonly expressed as `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Assumption of O(1) Arithmetic:** The entire analysis hinges on the assumption that arithmetic operations on integers are constant-time. This is valid for numbers that fit within the hardware's standard integer types. If `n` were an arbitrarily large number requiring special data structures (like a bignum library), the cost of division and multiplication would no longer be `O(1)`. It would depend on the number of bits in the operands (which is proportional to `log n`), leading to a higher complexity, typically `O((log n)²)`. However, for standard algorithm analysis, `O(log n)` is the accepted answer.\n*   **Loop Termination:** The key insight is that the magnitude of the number being processed (`x`) decreases by a multiplicative factor (`c`) in each iteration. Whenever a problem's size is reduced by a constant factor in each step, the complexity is logarithmic.\n*   **Role of `c`:** The base `c` affects the actual runtime (a larger `c` leads to fewer iterations), but it does not change the asymptotic complexity class because `c` is treated as a constant parameter with respect to the input size `n`.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe dominant part of the algorithm is the `while` loop. The number of times this loop executes is determined by how many times the input number `n` can be divided by the base `c` before the result is less than 1. This number is precisely `log_c(n)`. Since each iteration of the loop performs a constant number of basic operations, the total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by a constant, which is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
