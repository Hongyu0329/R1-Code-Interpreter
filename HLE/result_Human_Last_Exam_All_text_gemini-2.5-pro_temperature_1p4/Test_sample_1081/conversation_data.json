    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Question:**\n    The question asks for the \"exact number\" of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A maximal torus is a maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup, and it is $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational if it is defined by polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. In the context of algebraic groups over finite fields, questions about the \"number\" of a certain type of subgroup typically refer to the number of conjugacy classes of these subgroups under the action of the group of rational points, $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. The total number of such subgroups would be a complicated expression depending on $q$, whereas the number of conjugacy classes is a fundamental invariant that is often independent of $q$. Thus, we interpret the question as asking for the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\n2.  **Classification of Maximal Tori over Finite Fields:**\n    There is a fundamental result in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields that classifies the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. Let $G$ be a reductive group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism. Let $W$ be the Weyl group of $G$. The Frobenius endomorphism $F$ induces an automorphism of $W$. The theorem states that the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n\n3.  **Defining $F$-conjugacy:**\n    Two elements $w_1, w_2 \\in W$ are said to be in the same $F$-conjugacy class if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$. The number of such classes is what we need to compute.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Group of Type $E_8$:**\n    The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. We need to understand the structure of such a group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and the corresponding action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on its Weyl group $W = W(E_8)$.\n    *   The different forms of a simple algebraic group over a field are classified by the Galois cohomology of its automorphism group. For a group over a finite field, all forms are obtained by twisting the split form.\n    *   The outer automorphism group of a simple algebraic group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of its Dynkin diagram.\n    *   The Dynkin diagram for the root system of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group (it has no symmetries).\n    *   This implies that any group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a \"split\" group (a Chevalley group). For a split group, the standard Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the associated root datum, and therefore acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$.\n\n5.  **Simplifying $F$-conjugacy for $E_8$:**\n    Since the action of $F$ on $W(E_8)$ is trivial, we have $F(x) = x$ for all $x \\in W(E_8)$. The definition of an $F$-conjugacy class thus simplifies:\n    $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1} = x w_1 x^{-1}$.\n    This is the definition of ordinary conjugacy in the group $W$.\n    Therefore, for a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the $F$-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes.\n\n6.  **Reducing the Problem to a Combinatorial Question:**\n    Based on the analysis above, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This is a well-known result from the theory of finite reflection groups (also known as Coxeter groups).\n\n7.  **Finding the Number of Conjugacy Classes of $W(E_8)$:**\n    The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite group of order $696,729,600$. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed and is a standard result in the literature on the subject. Notably, R.W. Carter in his paper \"Conjugacy classes in the Weyl group\" (Compositio Mathematica, 1972) provides a table with these numbers for all exceptional Weyl groups. The result is also available in computational algebra systems like GAP (specifically, its CHEVIE package) and other standard representation theory texts.\n\n    The number of conjugacy classes for $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a group $G$ of type $E_8$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112. This number is independent of the choice of the prime power $q$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   **Interpretation of the question:** The \"number of tori\" should be interpreted as the \"number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of tori\".\n*   **Structure of $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$:** It is crucial to recognize that the group must be split because the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms.\n*   **Action of Frobenius:** For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group.\n*   **$F$-conjugacy vs. ordinary conjugacy:** The trivial action of Frobenius means the classification simplifies from counting $F$-conjugacy classes to counting ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group.\n*   **Final step:** The problem is reduced to a known combinatorial fact about the group $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe final answer is the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$.\n\n<<<112>>>"
