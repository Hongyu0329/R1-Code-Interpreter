    "An elegant problem in geometry asks for the minimum area of a convex shape that is guaranteed to intersect a specific family of lines. Let's analyze this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Family of Lines\n\nThe lines are given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. Let's denote the set of these lines as `L`.\n\n*   **Coprime Integers:** The condition `gcd(p, q) = 1` is crucial. It means `p` and `q` have no common factors other than 1.\n*   **Examples of lines in `L`:**\n    *   If `(p,q) = (1,0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n    *   If `(p,q) = (-1,0)`, the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n    *   If `(p,q) = (0,1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n    *   If `(p,q) = (0,-1)`, the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\n    *   If `(p,q) = (1,1)`, the line is `x + y = 1`.\n    *   If `(p,q) = (1,-1)`, the line is `x - y = 1`.\n    *   If `(p,q) = (-1,1)`, the line is `-x + y = 1`.\n    *   If `(p,q) = (-1,-1)`, the line is `-x - y = 1`, or `x + y = -1`.\n    *   If `(p,q) = (1,2)`, the line is `x + 2y = 1`.\n*   **Geometric Interpretation:** A line `px + qy = c` contains integer coordinate points if and only if `gcd(p,q)` divides `c`. Since our lines are `px + qy = 1` and we require `gcd(p,q) = 1`, this condition is satisfied. Thus, the family `L` consists of all lines in the plane that pass through at least one integer point `(x₀, y₀)` such that `px₀ + qy₀ = 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Area (Constructing a Candidate Domain)\n\nWe need to find a convex domain `K` that intersects every line in `L`. If we can find such a domain, its area will be an upper bound for the minimal area.\n\nConsider the square defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`. Let's call this domain `S`.\n*   **Shape:** This is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`.\n*   **Convexity:** This domain is convex.\n*   **Area:** The side length of this square is `√((1-0)² + (0-1)²) = √2`. The area of `S` is `(√2)² = 2`.\n\nNow, we must verify that `S` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` where `gcd(p,q)=1`.\nA line `px + qy = 1` fails to intersect the convex set `S` if and only if `S` lies entirely in one of the open half-planes `px + qy > 1` or `px + qy < 1`.\nThis is equivalent to checking if the maximum and minimum values of the expression `px + qy` for `(x,y)` in `S` straddle the value 1. That is, `min_{(x,y)∈S}(px+qy) ≤ 1 ≤ max_{(x,y)∈S}(px+qy)`.\n\nThe expression `f(x,y) = px + qy` is linear, so its extrema on the convex polygon `S` occur at the vertices: `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n*   `f(1,0) = p`\n*   `f(0,1) = q`\n*   `f(-1,0) = -p`\n*   `f(0,-1) = -q`\n\nThe maximum value of `px+qy` on `S` is `max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nThe minimum value is `min(p, q, -p, -q) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\nSo, the condition for intersection is: `-max(|p|,|q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|,|q|)`.\nThe left inequality, `-max(|p|,|q|) ≤ 1`, is always true since `p,q` are integers, so `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 0`.\nThe right inequality is `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1`. Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. Therefore, at least one of them must be a non-zero integer, which means `|p|≥1` or `|q|≥1`. This implies `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1`.\n\nThe condition holds for all pairs of coprime integers `(p,q)`. Thus, the domain `S` intersects every line in the family `L`.\nThe area of `S` is 2. This means the minimal area is at most 2.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound for the Area\n\nNow we must prove that any such convex domain `K` must have an area of at least 2.\n\n1.  Consider the following four lines from the family `L`:\n    *   `L₁: x = 1` (for `p=1, q=0`)\n    *   `L₂: x = -1` (for `p=-1, q=0`)\n    *   `L₃: y = 1` (for `p=0, q=1`)\n    *   `L₄: y = -1` (for `p=0, q=-1`)\n\n2.  These four lines form the boundary of a square `C = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`. This square has vertices at `(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,1)`. The area of `C` is `2 × 2 = 4`.\n\n3.  By the problem statement, the convex domain `K` must intersect each of these four lines. This means there is at least one point of `K` on each of the four sides of the square `C`.\n\n4.  We can now use a theorem from geometry, first proven by A. M. Macbeath. The theorem states:\n    > If a convex set `K` contains at least one point on each side of a parallelogram `P`, then the area of `K` must be at least half the area of `P`.\n    > `Area(K) ≥ Area(P) / 2`.\n\n5.  In our case, `K` is our convex domain, and the parallelogram `P` is the square `C`.\n    Applying the theorem, we get:\n    `Area(K) ≥ Area(C) / 2`\n    `Area(K) ≥ 4 / 2`\n    `Area(K) ≥ 2`\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we found a convex domain with the required properties that has an area of 2. Therefore, the minimal area cannot be more than 2 (`A_min ≤ 2`).\nFrom Step 3, we proved that any convex domain with the required properties must have an area of at least 2 (`A_min ≥ 2`).\n\nCombining these two results, the minimal area must be exactly 2."
