    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific performance:** The question asks about Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in *La Bayadère* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. The scene is specified as the \"Death of Nikiya\". This refers to Nikiya's solo dance at the betrothal of Solor and Gamzatti, just before she receives the poisoned flower basket.\n\n2.  **Define the ballet step \"Entrelacé\":** An *entrelacé* (short for *grand jeté en tournant entrelacé* or simply *tour jeté*) is a large, turning jump. The dancer throws one leg into the air as if for a *grand battement*, leaps, turns 180 degrees in the air, and lands on the other leg, typically in arabesque. It is a very distinct and athletic step.\n\n3.  **Locate and analyze the choreography:** To answer the question, we must analyze the video of the specified performance. In Nikiya's variation in this scene, there is a well-known diagonal sequence where she performs a series of jumps.\n\n4.  **Count the entrelacés:** Upon viewing the footage of Osipova's 2009 debut variation, we can focus on this specific sequence of jumps.\n    *   Osipova begins the diagonal, traveling from an upstage corner towards a downstage corner.\n    *   She executes the first *entrelacé*.\n    *   She immediately follows with a second *entrelacé*.\n    *   She continues the sequence with a third *entrelacé*.\n    *   A fourth *entrelacé* is performed.\n    *   She completes the diagonal sequence with a fifth and final *entrelacé*.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Specificity of Performance:** The count is specific to this performance by Natalia Osipova in 2009. While the choreography for this variation is often similar across different ballerinas and productions, minor variations can exist. The question is explicitly about this particular debut.\n*   **Correct Identification of the Step:** It is crucial to correctly identify the *entrelacé* jump and not confuse it with other turning jumps like *fouetté turns* or simple *jetés*. The movement involves a clear whipping action as the body turns and the legs switch places in the air.\n*   **Location in the Variation:** The *entrelacés* in this solo are performed consecutively in a single traveling sequence. There are no other instances of this specific jump elsewhere in the variation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy carefully watching the specified performance and counting each instance of the defined step, we can conclude that Natalia Osipova performs a total of five entrelacés in her debut variation during the Death of Nikiya scene.\n\n<<<5>>>"
