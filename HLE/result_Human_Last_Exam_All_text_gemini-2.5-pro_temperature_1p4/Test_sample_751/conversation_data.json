    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the discrete-time system to observer canonical form and find the new matrix C.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Duality**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to find the observer canonical form using the principle of duality. The new system will be described by (A_o, C_o), where A_o = T⁻¹AT and C_o = CT for some transformation matrix T. We need to find the value of this new matrix C_o.\n\nThe duality principle states that a system (A, C) is observable if and only if its dual system (A^T, C^T) is controllable. The transformation to observer canonical form for (A, C) is dual to the transformation to controller canonical form for (A^T, C^T).\n\n**2. Define the Dual System**\n\nThe dual system is (A_d, B_d) where:\nA_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\nThis is a multi-input system (n=3 states, m=2 inputs). The procedure for finding a canonical form for a multi-input system is complex and the resulting form is not unique, as it depends on the choice of basis vectors. A standard approach is to derive the transformation based on one of the inputs. This corresponds to basing the observer form on one of the outputs of the original system.\n\n**3. Reduce to a Single-Input Dual System**\n\nLet's choose the first column of B_d, which corresponds to the first row of C (c1 = [0, 1, 0]). Let's call this input b_d1.\nb_d1 = [0, 1, 0]^T\nWe will find the transformation T_c that puts the single-input system (A_d, b_d1) into controller canonical form.\n\n**4. Find the Controller Canonical Form Transformation (T_c)**\n\nThe transformation matrix T_c for x_d = T_c * z is given by T_c = W_c * M, where W_c is the controllability matrix and M is constructed from the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.\n\n*   **Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    The characteristic polynomial is det(sI - A). Note that det(sI - A) = det(sI - A^T).\n    det(sI - A) = det([[s-1, -1, 0], [-2, s-1, -1], [0, -2, s]])\n    = (s-1)(s(s-1) - 2) + 1(-2s)\n    = (s-1)(s² - s - 2) - 2s\n    = s³ - s² - 2s - s² + s + 2 - 2s\n    = s³ - 2s² - 3s + 2\n    So, the coefficients are a_1 = -2, a_2 = -3, a_3 = 2.\n\n*   **Matrix M:**\n    M = [[a_2, a_1, 1], [a_1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]] = [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]\n\n*   **Controllability Matrix W_c:**\n    W_c = [b_d1, A_d*b_d1, A_d²*b_d1]\n    b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]^T\n    A_d*b_d1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T\n    A_d² = A_d * A_d = [[3, 4, 4], [2, 5, 2], [1, 1, 2]]\n    A_d²*b_d1 = [[3, 4, 4], [2, 5, 2], [1, 1, 2]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [4, 5, 1]^T\n    W_c = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]]\n\n*   **Transformation Matrix T_c:**\n    T_c = W_c * M = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]] * [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]\n    T_c = [[0, 2, 0], [0, -1, 1], [-1, 1, 0]]\n\n**5. Find the Observer Canonical Form Transformation (T_o)**\n\nBy duality, the transformation T_o for the original system (A, C) is related to T_c by T_o = (T_c⁻¹)^T.\n\n*   **Inverse of T_c:**\n    First, find T_c⁻¹.\n    det(T_c) = 0 - 2(0 - (-1)) + 0 = -2\n    adj(T_c) = [[-1, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0], [-1, -2, 0]]^T = [[-2, -1, -1], [0, 0, -2], [2, 0, 0]]^T\n    adj(T_c)^T = [[-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0], [-1, -2, 0]]\n    T_c⁻¹ = (1/det(T_c)) * adj(T_c)^T = (1/-2) * [[-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0], [-1, -2, 0]]\n    T_c⁻¹ = [[1, 0, -1], [1/2, 0, 0], [1/2, 1, 0]]\n\n*   **Transformation Matrix T_o:**\n    T_o = (T_c⁻¹)^T = [[1, 1/2, 1/2], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]\n\n**6. Calculate the New C Matrix (C_o)**\n\nThe new output matrix is C_o = C * T_o.\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1/2, 1/2], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]\nC_o = [[(0*1 + 1*0 + 0*(-1)), (0*1/2 + 1*0 + 0*0), (0*1/2 + 1*1 + 0*0)],\n       [(1*1 + 1*0 + 0*(-1)), (1*1/2 + 1*0 + 0*0), (1*1/2 + 1*1 + 0*0)]]\nC_o = [[0, 0, 1],\n       [1, 1/2, 3/2]]\n\nThe new matrix C is [[0, 0, 1], [1, 1/2, 3/2]].\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 1], [1, 0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
