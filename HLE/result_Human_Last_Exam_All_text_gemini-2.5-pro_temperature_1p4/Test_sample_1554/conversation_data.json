    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** Belonging to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\". This is a specific Polish school of analytic philosophy and logic active mainly between 1918 and 1939.\n    *   **Philosophical Contribution:** The decomposition of the notion of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n2.  **Identify Key Figures of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   The school was founded by Kazimierz Twardowski.\n    *   Prominent members (the first generation of Twardowski's students and their successors) include Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, and Alfred Tarski, among others.\n    *   The task is to identify which of these thinkers is known for the specific conceptual distinction mentioned.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction: \"Hallmark\" into \"Symptoms\" and \"Signals\"**:\n    *   The term \"hallmark\" can be understood as a general term for a sign (*znak* in Polish).\n    *   **Symptom:** This term suggests a natural or causal connection. For instance, smoke is a symptom of fire. The connection isn't based on a human agreement but on a natural law or correlation. One *infers* the existence of the fire from the presence of the smoke.\n    *   **Signal:** This term suggests a conventional or intentional connection. For instance, a red traffic light is a signal to stop. Its meaning is established by a rule or convention for the purpose of communication. A word is a classic example of a signal.\n    *   This distinction is a fundamental one in semantics and the philosophy of language, differentiating natural signs from conventional signs.\n\n4.  **Connect the Distinction to a Philosopher:**\n    *   We need to search within the works of the Lviv-Warsaw School philosophers for this specific analysis of signs.\n    *   While many members worked on logic and language, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the philosopher most directly associated with this distinction.\n    *   In his works on epistemology and philosophy of language, particularly in his analysis of meaning, Ajdukiewicz distinguished between different kinds of signs. He used the term *oznaka* for what is translated as \"symptom\" or \"index\"—a natural sign from which one can infer something. He used the term *znak* (in a narrower sense) or *sygnał* for what is translated as \"signal\"—a conventional sign used intentionally in communication according to a set of rules.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who analyzed the general notion of a sign (or \"hallmark\") and broke it down into natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This distinction was central to his philosophy of language and his analysis of meaning and communication.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Translation:** The English terms \"hallmark,\" \"symptom,\" and \"signal\" are translations of specific philosophical terms from Polish. \"Hallmark\" stands in for the general concept of a sign (*znak*). \"Symptom\" corresponds to *oznaka*. \"Signal\" corresponds to *sygnał* or a narrower sense of *znak*. Understanding this helps pinpoint the exact philosopher.\n*   **Context:** This distinction is not unique to Ajdukiewicz in the history of philosophy (it echoes distinctions made by the Stoics and Charles Sanders Peirce's index vs. symbol), but within the specific context of the Lviv-Warsaw School, it is a hallmark of Ajdukiewicz's own work.\n*   **Exclusion of Others:** While Tarski worked on semantics (theory of truth) and Kotarbiński on language (reism), this particular division of signs into the natural/inferential and the conventional/communicative is a signature contribution of Ajdukiewicz's analysis of language.\n\nThe final answer is the name of the philosopher.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
