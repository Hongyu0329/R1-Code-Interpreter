**1. Appropriate Management Procedures:**
*   **Immediate Phase (Emergency Care):**
    *   **Medical Management:** First priority is an urgent medical consultation to manage her uncontrolled diabetes and obesity. Treatment must be initiated to lower her HbA1c level.
    *   **Dental Trauma Management:** Since 28 hours have passed, replantation is impossible. The sockets must be gently debrided, irrigated with sterile saline, and sutured.
    *   **Prescriptions:** A course of systemic antibiotics is essential due to high infection risk. Analgesics should be prescribed for pain.
*   **Healing Phase:** A period of 4-6 months is required for the bone and soft tissue to heal and mature. An interim (temporary) removable denture can be provided for aesthetics.
*   **Definitive Phase (Post-Healing and Glycemic Control):** Proceed with the final prosthetic plan only after her diabetes is well-controlled (HbA1c < 7%).

**2. Cells of Interest:**
*   **Wound Healing and Immune Cells:** Fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages. These are of interest because their function is significantly impaired by uncontrolled diabetes, leading to delayed healing and a high risk of infection.
*   **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) Cells:** These cells on the avulsed tooth roots are of interest because their death after 28 hours makes replantation futile.

**3. Denture Replacement Plan:**
*   **Kind of Denture:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**. This provides superior support and stability compared to an all-acrylic "flipper."
*   **Material:** The framework should be a **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy**. The teeth and gum-colored base will be made of **Acrylic Resin**.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Left Central Incisor and Left Second Premolar:** These are the teeth adjacent to the gap. They will be used for primary support (via rests) and retention (via clasps).
    *   **Right Second Premolar and/or Right First Molar:** At least one tooth on the contralateral (opposite) side will be used for indirect retention and stability, preventing the denture from rocking or lifting during function.
