The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$, more accurately written as $(\phi, D\phi)$, represents twice the free Euclidean action ($2S_E[\phi]$) for the neutral scalar field. In position space, it is given by the integral $(\phi, D\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \phi(x) (-\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2) \phi(x)$. In momentum space, using Matsubara frequencies $\omega_n = 2\pi nT$, it is given by $(\phi, D\phi) = T \sum_{n} \int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3} |\tilde{\phi}(\omega_n, \vec{k})|^2 (\omega_n^2 + \vec{k}^2 + m^2)$.
