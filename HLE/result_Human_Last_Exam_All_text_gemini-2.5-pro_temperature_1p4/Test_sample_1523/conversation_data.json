    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature field theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and the Partition Function**\nWe consider a neutral scalar field $\\phi$ with mass $m$ at a finite temperature $T$. The theory is formulated in Euclidean spacetime using the imaginary time formalism (or Matsubara formalism). In this formalism:\n*   Time $t$ is replaced by imaginary time $\\tau = it$.\n*   The time coordinate is compactified and periodic: $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$, where $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   The scalar field must satisfy periodic boundary conditions: $\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) = \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau + \\beta)$.\n\nThe central object is the partition function $Z$, which is expressed as a functional integral over all field configurations satisfying the boundary conditions:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n\n**2. The Euclidean Action and the Quadratic Form**\nThe question refers to the term $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, which arises from the quadratic part of the action (i.e., the free theory). The Euclidean action for a free neutral scalar field is:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 \\right)$\nThis can be written compactly as $S_E[\\phi] = \\int d^4x_E \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 \\right)$.\n\nTo identify the operator $D$, we perform an integration by parts on the kinetic term $(\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)^2$:\n$\\int d^4x_E \\, (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)^2 = \\int d^4x_E \\, [ \\partial_\\mu^E (\\phi \\partial_\\mu^E \\phi) - \\phi (\\partial_\\mu^E \\partial_\\mu^E \\phi) ]$\nThe term $\\partial_\\mu^E (\\phi \\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)$ is a total derivative. According to Gauss's theorem, its integral is a boundary term. These boundary terms vanish due to the periodicity in $\\tau$ and the assumption that the field decays to zero at spatial infinity.\n\nUsing the Euclidean D'Alembertian operator $\\Box_E = \\partial_\\mu^E \\partial_\\mu^E = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$, the action becomes:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int d^4x_E \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\phi \\Box_E \\phi + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\Box_E + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\n**3. Identification of the Inner Product and the Operator D**\nThe expression for the action now has the structure $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$. From this form, we can identify each part:\n*   **The Operator $D$**: The operator is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, $D = -\\Box_E + m^2 = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2$. (The subscript in the question's notation $D_\\phi$ is likely contextual and can be dropped).\n*   **The Inner Product**: The inner product $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is the standard $L^2$ inner product for real functions over the 4D Euclidean spacetime volume:\n    $(f, g) = \\int d^4x_E \\, f(x)g(x) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, f(\\vec{x}, \\tau) g(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n\nTherefore, the expression $(\\phi, D\\phi)$ is:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(x) [ D \\phi(x) ] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\Box_E + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\nFrom the derivation in Step 2, it is clear that this inner product is exactly **twice the free Euclidean action**: $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi]$.\n\n### Careful Points and Further Details\n\n**1. Momentum Space Representation:**\nIn finite-temperature calculations, it is often more convenient to work in momentum space. The periodicity in imaginary time implies that the Fourier transform with respect to $\\tau$ becomes a discrete Fourier series. The field can be expanded as:\n$\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} e^{i(\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{x} + \\omega_n \\tau)} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{k})$\nwhere $\\omega_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{\\beta}$ are the **bosonic Matsubara frequencies**.\n\nIn this momentum basis, the derivatives transform into algebraic multiplication:\n*   $\\nabla \\rightarrow i\\vec{k} \\implies \\nabla^2 \\rightarrow -\\vec{k}^2$\n*   $\\partial_\\tau \\rightarrow i\\omega_n \\implies \\partial_\\tau^2 \\rightarrow -\\omega_n^2$\n\nThe operator $D = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2$ becomes a simple multiplicative factor (its eigenvalue) in momentum space:\n$D(\\omega_n, \\vec{k}) = -(-\\omega_n^2 - \\vec{k}^2) + m^2 = \\omega_n^2 + \\vec{k}^2 + m^2$\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2S_E[\\phi]$ can also be expressed in this basis:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = T \\sum_{n} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{k})|^2 (\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{k}^2 + m^2)$\n\n**2. Interpretation:**\nThe expression $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi]$ represents the Gaussian part of the action's exponent in the partition function $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)}$. Evaluating the resulting Gaussian functional integral gives the partition function for the free theory, which is proportional to $(\\det D)^{-1/2}$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation of the partition function is an inner product of the field $\\phi$ with the result of acting the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator $D = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2$ on the field $\\phi$. It is equivalent to twice the free Euclidean action, $2S_E[\\phi]$. It can be expressed in two equivalent ways:\n\n**1. In Position Space:**\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\left( -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n\n**2. In Momentum/Matsubara Frequency Space:**\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{k})|^2 \\left( \\omega_n^2 + \\vec{k}^2 + m^2 \\right)$\nwhere $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n T$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies and $\\tilde{\\phi}$ is the Fourier transform of the field.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, more accurately written as $(\\phi, D\\phi)$, represents twice the free Euclidean action ($2S_E[\\phi]$) for the neutral scalar field. In position space, it is given by the integral $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$. In momentum space, using Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n = 2\\pi nT$, it is given by $(\\phi, D\\phi) = T \\sum_{n} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{k})|^2 (\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{k}^2 + m^2)$.>>>"
