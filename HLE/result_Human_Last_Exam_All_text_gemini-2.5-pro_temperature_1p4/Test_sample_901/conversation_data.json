    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry is specified.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) in tert-butyl alcohol. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an **E2 (elimination, bimolecular) reaction**. The bulky nature of the base further favors elimination over substitution (SN2) and also tends to favor the formation of the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product) if there's a choice.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Substrate and E2 Requirements:**\n    *   The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must both be in **axial** positions, and on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down). This is called a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n\n3.  **Draw the Chair Conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane:**\n    *   First, determine the relative orientation of the substituents. For adjacent carbons on a cyclohexane ring, an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration indicates a **trans** relationship. Therefore, the bromo and methyl groups are trans to each other.\n    *   Cyclohexane exists in two rapidly interconverting chair conformations. We need to draw both and see which one can undergo the E2 reaction.\n\n    *   **Conformer A:** We can place the bulky methyl group in the more stable **equatorial** position. Since the bromo group is trans to the methyl group (a 1,2-trans relationship), it must also be **equatorial**. This is the trans-diequatorial conformation.\n        *   In this conformation, the leaving group (Br) is **equatorial**. An equatorial group is not anti-periplanar to any β-hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 or C6).\n        *   **Therefore, Conformer A cannot undergo an E2 reaction.**\n\n    *   **Conformer B:** This is formed by a ring-flip of Conformer A. The equatorial groups become axial.\n        *   The methyl group becomes **axial**.\n        *   The bromo group becomes **axial**. This is the trans-diaxial conformation.\n        *   This conformer is less stable than Conformer A, but the molecule must adopt this conformation for the E2 reaction to occur.\n\n4.  **Identify the Reacting Conformation and Available β-Protons:**\n    *   The reaction must proceed through **Conformer B**, where the bromine is axial. Let's assume the axial Br is pointing \"up\".\n    *   Now we must look for β-hydrogens that are axial and pointing \"down\". The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon has the methyl group and a hydrogen. In this conformation (Conformer B), the methyl group is axial (and trans to Br, so it would be pointing \"down\"). This means the hydrogen on C2 is in the **equatorial** position. There is **no axial hydrogen** on C2.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial and one is equatorial. The axial hydrogen points \"down\", making it **trans-diaxial** to the \"up\" axial bromine on C1.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The base (tert-butoxide) can only abstract the axial proton from **C6**. Elimination towards C2 to form the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene) is not possible due to the lack of an anti-periplanar proton.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product:**\n    *   Since the elimination must occur between C1 and C6, a double bond forms between these two carbons. The methyl group on C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group.\n    *   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the double bond gets the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2). In our product, the carbons of the double bond are the original C1 and C6. The methyl group is on the original C2. So, if we number the double bond as C1-C2 in the final product, the methyl group is attached to the next carbon, C3.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (disubstituted) alkene, known as the Hofmann product. Its formation is dictated here by the stereochemical constraints of the E2 reaction.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize that the reaction is E2 and requires a trans-diaxial arrangement.\n*   Correctly identify the substrate's substituents (Br and Me) as being trans to each other based on the (1S,2R) stereochemistry.\n*   Draw both chair conformers and identify that only the less stable conformer (with axial Br) can react.\n*   In the reactive conformer, carefully check the positions of the β-hydrogens on C2 and C6.\n*   Realize that only one β-hydrogen (on C6) meets the anti-periplanar requirement, forcing the reaction to form only one specific product.\n*   Name the final product using correct IUPAC nomenclature for alkenes.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
