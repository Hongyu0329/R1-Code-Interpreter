    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n### Step 1: Deduce the basic properties of the function $f$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of such functions. We want to find $|S|$.\nThe given equation is $f(f(x)) = e^x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. This means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function $x \\mapsto e^x$ is one-to-one, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing). Let's check both possibilities.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then if $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ again preserves the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means $e^{x_1} < e^{x_2}$, which is true for $x_1 < x_2$. So, $f$ can be strictly increasing.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then if $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means $e^{x_1} < e^{x_2}$, which is also true for $x_1 < x_2$. So, $f$ can be strictly decreasing.\n    Thus, any solution must be a strictly monotonic function.\n\n3.  **Fixed Points:** A fixed point of $f$ would be a value $p$ such that $f(p)=p$. If such a point exists, then $f(f(p)) = f(p) = p$. The equation becomes $e^p = p$. The function $g(x) = e^x - x$ has derivative $g'(x)=e^x-1$. The minimum occurs at $x=0$, where $g(0)=1$. Thus, $e^x-x \\ge 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which means $e^x=x$ has no real solutions. Therefore, $f$ has no fixed points.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the cardinality.\n\nThe set of solutions $S$ is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which we denote as $C(\\mathbb{R})$. A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, such as the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\aleph_0$. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\nThe cardinality of $C(\\mathbb{R})$ is $| \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q}} | = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\nSince $S \\subseteq C(\\mathbb{R})$, we must have $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a lower bound for the cardinality by construction.\n\nTo show that $|S| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$, we need to demonstrate the existence of at least a continuum of distinct solutions. We can do this by showing that we have a continuum of choices in constructing a solution. This is a known problem in the field of functional equations and dynamical systems, specifically concerning fractional iteration of functions (finding a \"half-iterate\" of $e^x$).\n\nA standard method to construct solutions for $f(f(x))=g(x)$ is via Abel's functional equation. For $g(x)=e^x$, we seek a function $\\sigma(x)$ such that:\n$\\sigma(e^x) = \\sigma(x) + 1$\n\n1.  **Existence of an Abel function:** It is a known, non-trivial result that there exists a strictly increasing, real analytic solution $\\sigma_0: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ to this equation.\n\n2.  **Constructing a solution f:** Given such a $\\sigma_0$, we can define a function $f(x)$ as the \"half-iterate\" of $e^x$:\n    $f(x) = \\sigma_0^{-1}(\\sigma_0(x) + 1/2)$\n    Let's verify this is a solution:\n    $f(f(x)) = \\sigma_0^{-1}(\\sigma_0(\\sigma_0^{-1}(\\sigma_0(x) + 1/2)) + 1/2)$\n    $f(f(x)) = \\sigma_0^{-1}((\\sigma_0(x) + 1/2) + 1/2)$\n    $f(f(x)) = \\sigma_0^{-1}(\\sigma_0(x) + 1)$\n    Using the Abel equation property for $\\sigma_0^{-1}$ (which is $\\sigma_0^{-1}(y+1) = e^{\\sigma_0^{-1}(y)}$), we get:\n    $f(f(x)) = e^{\\sigma_0^{-1}(\\sigma_0(x))} = e^x$.\n    So, at least one continuous (in fact, analytic) solution exists.\n\n3.  **Constructing a continuum of solutions:** The Abel function $\\sigma_0$ is not unique. If $\\sigma_0$ is a solution, and $P(u)$ is any function periodic with period 1 (i.e., $P(u+1)=P(u)$), then $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_0(x) + P(\\sigma_0(x))$ is also a solution:\n    $\\sigma(e^x) = \\sigma_0(e^x) + P(\\sigma_0(e^x)) = \\sigma_0(x)+1 + P(\\sigma_0(x)+1) = \\sigma_0(x)+1 + P(\\sigma_0(x)) = (\\sigma_0(x) + P(\\sigma_0(x))) + 1 = \\sigma(x)+1$.\n\n    Now, we can choose a family of periodic functions to generate a family of solutions $f$. Let $P_c(u) = c \\cdot \\sin(2\\pi u)$ for any real constant $c$. Let $\\sigma_c(x) = \\sigma_0(x) + c \\cdot \\sin(2\\pi \\sigma_0(x))$. For sufficiently small values of $|c|$, the function $\\sigma_c(x)$ will remain strictly increasing, and thus will have a continuous inverse $\\sigma_c^{-1}$.\n\n    For each such $c$, we can define a solution:\n    $f_c(x) = \\sigma_c^{-1}(\\sigma_c(x) + 1/2)$\n\n    Each distinct value of $c$ yields a distinct function $f_c$. Since $c$ can be any real number in a certain interval around 0, we have an uncountable infinity of choices for $c$. This constructs a family of solutions $\\{f_c\\}_{c \\in I}$ where $I$ is an interval, so the size of this family is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion on Cardinality.\n\nFrom Step 2, the cardinality of the set of solutions $S$ is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nFrom Step 3, we have constructed a family of solutions with cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, so the cardinality of $S$ is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nCombining these two results, we have $|S| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$, is also denoted as $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nFinal answer will be the symbol for the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe careful points are:\n1.  Verifying the basic properties of $f$ (injective, monotonic, no fixed points).\n2.  Knowing the cardinality of the space of continuous functions, $C(\\mathbb{R})$, is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n3.  Knowing that solutions can be constructed via fractional iteration, specifically using an Abel function.\n4.  Realizing that the non-uniqueness of the Abel function is the key to constructing a continuum of solutions.\n5.  Putting the upper and lower bounds together to conclude the exact cardinality.\n\nFinal Answer: The cardinality is that of the continuum.\n\n>>>\\mathfrak{c}"
