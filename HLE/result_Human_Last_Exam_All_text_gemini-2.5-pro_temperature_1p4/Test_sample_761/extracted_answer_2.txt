No. Polynucleotides, including homopolynucleotides, are not structurally polysaccharides. They differ in three fundamental ways:
1.  **Monomer Unit:** Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides (simple sugars). Polynucleotides are polymers of nucleotides, which are more complex units composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.
2.  **Bonding:** Polysaccharide monomers are linked by glycosidic bonds. Polynucleotide monomers are linked by phosphodiester bonds, which create a distinctive sugar-phosphate backbone.
3.  **Chemical Composition:** Polysaccharides are primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Polynucleotides also contain significant amounts of nitrogen (in the bases) and phosphorus (in the phosphate backbone).
