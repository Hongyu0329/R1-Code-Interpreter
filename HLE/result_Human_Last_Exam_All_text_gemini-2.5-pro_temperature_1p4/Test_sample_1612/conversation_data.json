    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown in MLB\nFirst, we must understand what the \"Triple Crown\" is. In Major League Baseball, the Batting Triple Crown is an achievement where a player leads their specific league (either the American League or the National League) in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\nIt is considered one of the most difficult and prestigious accomplishments for a hitter.\n\n### Step 2: Identify All Triple Crown Seasons\nNext, we need to list every instance a player has won the Triple Crown in MLB history. This includes the American League, the National League, and other historical leagues officially recognized as \"Major Leagues\" (like the American Association).\n\nHere is the chronological list of all Triple Crown-winning seasons:\n1.  **1878:** Paul Hines (National League)\n2.  **1887:** Tip O'Neill (American Association)\n3.  **1894:** Hugh Duffy (National League)\n4.  **1901:** Nap Lajoie (American League)\n5.  **1909:** Ty Cobb (American League)\n6.  **1912:** Heinie Zimmerman (National League)\n7.  **1922:** Rogers Hornsby (National League)\n8.  **1925:** Rogers Hornsby (National League)\n9.  **1933:** Jimmie Foxx (American League)\n10. **1933:** Chuck Klein (National League)\n11. **1934:** Lou Gehrig (American League)\n12. **1937:** Joe Medwick (National League)\n13. **1942:** Ted Williams (American League)\n14. **1947:** Ted Williams (American League)\n15. **1956:** Mickey Mantle (American League)\n16. **1966:** Frank Robinson (American League)\n17. **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski (American League)\n18. **2012:** Miguel Cabrera (American League)\n\nCounting these instances, we find that the Triple Crown has been won **18 times** in total.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Unique Players (Winners)\nThe question asks for the number of \"Triple Crown winners,\" which implies counting the number of individual players who have accomplished the feat, not the total number of times it has been won.\n\nLooking at the list from Step 2, we can see that two players won the Triple Crown more than once:\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** won it twice (1922, 1925).\n*   **Ted Williams** won it twice (1942, 1947).\n\nTo find the number of unique winners, we start with the total number of Triple Crown seasons (18) and subtract the extra wins from the players who won multiple times.\n*   Total seasons = 18\n*   Multi-time winners = Rogers Hornsby (2 wins), Ted Williams (2 wins)\n*   Total unique players = 18 (total wins) - 2 (the second win for each of the two players) = **16**\n\nThe 16 unique players who have won the Triple Crown are: Paul Hines, Tip O'Neill, Hugh Duffy, Nap Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Heinie Zimmerman, Rogers Hornsby, Jimmie Foxx, Chuck Klein, Lou Gehrig, Joe Medwick, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, and Miguel Cabrera.\n\n### Step 4: List Careful Points and Nuances\n*   **Number of Wins vs. Number of Winners:** It is crucial to distinguish between the 18 times the Triple Crown was won and the 16 unique players who won it. The question asks for the number of winners.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** There is also a Pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in Wins, ERA, and Strikeouts). However, unless specified, \"Triple Crown\" in baseball overwhelmingly refers to the batting achievement.\n*   **Historical Record:** Some older lists may omit early winners like Paul Hines or Heinie Zimmerman due to statistical disputes that have since been clarified by modern research (like that from the Society for American Baseball Research - SABR). The comprehensive and currently accepted number of unique winners is 16.\n*   **Most Recent Winner:** The most recent Triple Crown winner was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, breaking a 45-year drought.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there have been 18 Triple Crown-winning seasons in MLB history, accomplished by 16 different players. Therefore, there are 16 Triple Crown winners.\n\n<<<16>>>"
