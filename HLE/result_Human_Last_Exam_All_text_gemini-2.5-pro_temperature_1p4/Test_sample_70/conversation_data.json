    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the concept of a flag's rank**\n\nThe question asks us to identify which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. The key assumptions are:\n1.  Flags are viewed as matrices.\n2.  The values in the matrix are chosen to make the rank *maximal*.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns) it has. For a flag, we can imagine it as a grid of pixels, where each pixel's color is represented by a number.\n\nLet's consider a flag with *k* distinct colors. To represent this as a matrix *M*, we assign a unique numerical value to each color, say `v_1, v_2, ..., v_k`. The matrix *M* can be expressed as a linear combination of *k* \"pattern matrices\" `P_1, P_2, ..., P_k`:\n`M = v_1*P_1 + v_2*P_2 + ... + v_k*P_k`\nHere, `P_i` is a binary matrix with a `1` where the *i*-th color appears and `0`s elsewhere.\n\nThe condition that the rank is *maximal* implies that we choose the values `v_1, ..., v_k` such that the resulting matrix `M` has the highest possible rank. This rank is limited by the number of linearly independent pattern matrices. For any standard national flag, the geometric patterns for each distinct color are not linear combinations of each other. Therefore, the set of pattern matrices `P_1, ..., P_k` will be linearly independent.\n\nThis leads to the crucial conclusion: **The maximal rank of a flag matrix is equal to the number of distinct colors in the flag.**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the rank of the flag of Denmark**\n\nThe flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross.\n*   Color 1: Red\n*   Color 2: White\n\nThe flag has exactly **two** distinct colors. Based on the conclusion from Step 1, the maximal linear algebraic rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n\n**Step 3: Find African flags with a rank of 2**\n\nWe are now looking for African national flags that also have a maximal rank of 2. This means we need to find all African flags that are composed of exactly **two** distinct colors. We will survey the flags of the 54 nations in Africa.\n\n*   **Flags with 3 or more colors:** The vast majority of African flags use three or more colors (e.g., Pan-African colors: green, yellow, red; or combinations with blue, white, black). Examples include Algeria (3 colors), South Africa (6 colors), Kenya (4 colors), Ethiopia (4 colors), Ghana (4 colors), etc. These flags all have a rank of 3 or higher.\n\n*   **Flags with 1 color:** A flag with only one color (e.g., the former flag of Libya, which was solid green) would have a rank of 1. Currently, no African nation has a single-color flag.\n\n*   **Flags with 2 colors:** We must identify the flags that use exactly two colors.\n\n**Step 4: List the two-colored African flags**\n\nAfter a thorough review of the 54 African national flags, the following nations are found to have flags with exactly two colors:\n\n1.  **Morocco:** The flag has a red field with a green pentagram (Seal of Solomon) in the center. The colors are red and green. **(Rank = 2)**\n2.  **Nigeria:** The flag is a vertical triband of green, white, and green. The colors are green and white. **(Rank = 2)**\n3.  **Somalia:** The flag has a light blue field with a single white five-pointed star in the center. The colors are light blue and white. **(Rank = 2)**\n4.  **Tunisia:** The flag has a red field with a central white disk. Inside the disk is a red star and crescent. The only colors used are red and white. **(Rank = 2)**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe flag of Denmark has a maximal rank of 2, corresponding to its two colors. The African nations whose flags also have exactly two colors, and therefore a maximal rank of 2, are Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, and Tunisia.\n\n<<<Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, and Tunisia>>>"
