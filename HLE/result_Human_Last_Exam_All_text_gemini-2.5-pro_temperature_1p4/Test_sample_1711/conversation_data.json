    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group and its Subgroups**\n\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n*   This is an abelian group, which is the direct product of 2024 copies of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The order of any element in $G$ must divide 49. Therefore, the possible orders of elements are 1, 7, and 49.\n*   A cyclic subgroup is a subgroup generated by a single element, denoted as $\\langle g \\rangle$ for some $g \\in G$. The order of the cyclic subgroup is the same as the order of the element generating it. So, cyclic subgroups of $G$ can have order 1, 7, or 49.\n\n**2. Analyze the Condition**\n\nWe are looking for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ is not empty. In other words, for every element $g \\in G$, we must have $A \\cap \\langle g \\rangle \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n**3. The Trivial Subgroup**\n\nLet's consider the simplest cyclic subgroup: the trivial subgroup $H_0 = \\{0\\}$, which is generated by the identity element $g=0$.\n*   For the condition $A \\cap H_0 \\neq \\emptyset$ to hold, we must have $A \\cap \\{0\\} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n*   This implies that the identity element $0$ must be in the set $A$.\n*   This single element already takes care of one part of the problem. We can now focus on the non-trivial cyclic subgroups and a set $A' = A \\setminus \\{0\\}$. The final answer will be $|A'| + 1$.\n\n**4. A Key Property of Non-Trivial Cyclic Subgroups**\n\nLet $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$ (so $g \\neq 0$).\n*   **Case 1: The order of $g$ is 7.** In this case, $H$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n*   **Case 2: The order of $g$ is 49.** In this case, $H$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 49. Since $H$ is a cyclic group of order $49=7^2$, it has a unique subgroup of order 7, which is generated by the element $7g$.\n\nThis leads to a crucial observation: **Every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains a unique subgroup of order 7.**\n\n**5. Reducing the Problem**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{L}$ be the set of all subgroups of order 7 in $G$.\n*   Let's assume we have a set $A' \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that $A'$ intersects every subgroup $L \\in \\mathcal{L}$. Let's define $A = A' \\cup \\{0\\}$.\n*   Does this set $A$ satisfy the original condition?\n    *   It hits the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$.\n    *   For any non-trivial cyclic subgroup $H$, we know it contains a unique subgroup $L \\in \\mathcal{L}$. By our assumption on $A'$, there is an element $a \\in A'$ such that $a \\in L$. Since $L \\subset H$, we have $a \\in H$. Thus, $A \\cap H$ is non-empty.\n*   This means that the problem is reduced to finding the smallest set $A'$ that \"hits\" every subgroup of order 7. Any such minimal hitting set $A'$, together with the zero element, will form a minimal set $A$ for the original problem.\n\n**6. Finding the Minimal Hitting Set for Subgroups of Order 7**\n\nLet's find the minimal size of $A'$ such that $A' \\cap L \\neq \\emptyset$ for every $L \\in \\mathcal{L}$.\n*   The elements of any subgroup $L$ of order 7 have order 7 (except for the identity). So, any element $a \\in A'$ that hits $L$ must be a non-zero element of $L$, and thus must have order 7.\n*   Let $a \\in A'$. The element $a$ generates its own cyclic subgroup, $\\langle a \\rangle$, which is a subgroup of order 7. This subgroup is unique; $a$ cannot belong to any other subgroup of order 7 because any two distinct subgroups of order 7 can only intersect at the identity element $\\{0\\}$.\n*   Therefore, each element $a \\in A'$ can hit exactly one subgroup from the collection $\\mathcal{L}$.\n*   To hit all the subgroups in $\\mathcal{L}$, the size of $A'$ must be at least the total number of such subgroups.\n*   $|A'| \\ge |\\mathcal{L}|$.\n*   This lower bound is achievable: we can construct $A'$ by selecting exactly one non-zero element from each subgroup of order 7.\n\n**7. Counting the Subgroups of Order 7**\n\nThe problem now boils down to counting the number of subgroups of order 7.\n*   A subgroup of order 7 is generated by an element of order 7.\n*   The set of all elements of order dividing 7 is $G[7] = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g = 0\\}$. For an element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$, $7g=0$ means $7g_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i$. This implies each $g_i$ must be a multiple of 7. The set of multiples of 7 in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ is $\\{0, 7, 14, \\dots, 42\\}$, which is a group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   Therefore, $G[7] \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is a vector space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$ of dimension $d = 2024$.\n*   A subgroup of order 7 is a cyclic group generated by a non-zero element of $G[7]$. Two non-zero vectors $v_1, v_2$ generate the same subgroup if and only if they are scalar multiples of each other (i.e., they lie on the same line through the origin).\n*   Thus, the number of subgroups of order 7 is equal to the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in the $\\mathbb{F}_7$-vector space of dimension 2024.\n*   The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in a $d$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^d - 1}{q - 1}$.\n*   In our case, $q=7$ and $d=2024$. The number of subgroups is:\n    $|\\mathcal{L}| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n**8. Final Answer Calculation**\n\nThe minimum size of $A'$ is $|\\mathcal{L}|$. The minimum size of the full set $A$ is $|A'| + 1$.\n*   Minimum size of $A = (\\text{Number of subgroups of order 7}) + 1$\n*   Minimum size of $A = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} + 1$.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the conclusion that the smallest size of the set $A$ is the number of subgroups of order 7, plus one for the trivial subgroup. The number of subgroups of order 7 is the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $\\mathbb{F}_7$ vector space of dimension 2024.\n\nSize = $\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7-1} + 1 = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} + 1$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}+1$>>>"
