    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Piece and Section:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to examine the very end of the last movement, the \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n2.  **Isolate the Instrument's Part:** We must find the score and look specifically at the musical staff for the \"Violino I\" or \"First Violin\".\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Measures:** The last movement, which is in B minor, concludes with a triumphant switch to B major. This is a common technique known as a \"Picardy third\". The very end of the symphony is marked \"Più mosso\" (more moved, or faster).\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Three Notes\":** The phrase \"ends on three notes\" refers to the final musical figure played by the first violin before the final sustained note. In the penultimate measure, the first violins play a rapid, rising sixteenth-note arpeggio based on the new B major tonic chord.\n\n5.  **List the Notes of the Arpeggio:** The three distinct notes that form this final arpeggio are:\n    *   **B** (written on the middle line of the treble clef staff - B4)\n    *   **D-sharp** (written on the fourth line, with a sharp accidental - D#5)\n    *   **F-sharp** (written in the top space of the staff - F#5)\n\n6.  **Compare the Pitches:** To find the lowest of these three notes, we compare their positions on the musical staff.\n    *   B4 is the lowest.\n    *   D#5 is a minor third higher than B4.\n    *   F#5 is a perfect fifth higher than B4.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The lowest note in this final three-note figure is B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Last Three Notes\":** The phrase could be interpreted in different ways. However, looking at the score, the most musically logical interpretation is the final three-note arpeggio that establishes the major-key ending.\n*   **Final Sustained Note:** After playing the arpeggio (B-D#-F#) which culminates in a high B5, the first violins then play a single, long, sustained whole note in the final measure. This note is B4, the same as the lowest note of the preceding arpeggio. This confirms that B is the foundational and lowest pitch of the finale for the first violins.\n*   **Key Signature and Accidentals:** It is crucial to note the key signature (B minor, with F# and C#) and the accidentals. The D-sharp is an accidental that changes the B minor chord (B-D-F#) to a B major chord (B-D#-F#) for the triumphant conclusion.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the score, we can definitively identify the three notes in question and determine the lowest one.\n\n<<<B>>>"
