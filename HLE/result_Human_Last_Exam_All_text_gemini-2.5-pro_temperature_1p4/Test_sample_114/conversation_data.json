    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific word from the given list that Geoffrey Chaucer does not use as a rhyming word in his poem \"The Book of the Duchess.\" This means we are looking for a word that either (a) appears at the end of a line but the corresponding line in the couplet does not rhyme with it, or (b) is a word that Chaucer simply never uses at the end of a line to create a rhyme.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Answer Choices in the Context of \"The Book of the Duchess\"**\nThe poem is primarily written in octosyllabic couplets (pairs of rhyming eight-syllable lines). We need to check each word to see if it has a rhyming partner in the poem.\n\n*   **A. Wente:** The Middle English word \"wente\" (meaning \"went\") is used as a rhyme word. For example, in lines 357-358:\n    > \"With that noyse, myn yen up **wente**,\n    > And my heed toke I good **entente**,\"\n    Since \"wente\" rhymes with \"entente,\" this choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. Here:** The Middle English word \"here\" (or \"heere\") is a common word and is used in rhymes. For example, in lines 935-936:\n    > \"Upon my trouthe, I sey yow **here**!\n    > Me thoghte the sonne shon never so **clere**,\"\n    Since \"here\" rhymes with \"clere\" (clear), this choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. Fool:** The word \"fool\" (or \"fole\") appears in the poem, but typically not at the end of a line. For instance, in line 572, the Dreamer says to the Black Knight, \"A, fool, thyself!\", but this is in the middle of a line of dialogue and does not participate in the line-end rhyme scheme. In standard modern editions, Chaucer does not place \"fool\" at the end of a line to be rhymed. This is a possible answer.\n\n*   **D. Hool:** The word \"hool\" (meaning \"whole\" or \"healthy\") does appear as a rhyme word, although manuscript versions can vary. In some textual traditions, it is rhymed with words like \"sol\" or \"fole.\" Given that a rhyme exists in major versions of the text, it is less likely to be the correct answer than a word that is definitively unrhymed.\n\n*   **E. Countour:** This word, meaning an accountant or one who calculates with a counting board (an abacus-like device), appears in a famous and specific context. In many authoritative editions (like Skeat's, based on the Fairfax manuscript), line 435 ends with \"countour.\" The line that follows, however, does not rhyme with it, breaking the expected couplet structure. This has been noted by scholars as a deliberate or accidental broken rhyme. Chaucer could have rhymed it with words like \"tour\" (tower), but he did not.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Strongest Candidates**\nWe are left with \"Fool\" and \"Countour\" as strong possibilities.\n*   \"Fool\" is not rhymed because it is generally not placed at the end of a line where a rhyme would be expected.\n*   \"Countour\" *is* placed at the end of a line where a rhyme is expected, but Chaucer does not provide the matching rhyme.\n\nThis makes \"Countour\" the more precise and famous example of a word Chaucer \"does NOT make a rhyme with\" in this poem. It's a specific, documented instance of a broken rhyme.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBased on scholarly analysis of the poem's text and structure, \"countour\" is the word that is famously left without a rhyme at the end of a line, breaking the couplet pattern.\n\n<<<E>>>"
