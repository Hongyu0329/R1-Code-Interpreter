    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a disk, or the topologist's sine curve.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point. The interval `[0, 1]` is nondegenerate, while a single point `{p}` is a degenerate continuum.\n*   **Product of two continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their product `X × Y` with the product topology is also a continuum. This is because the product of two compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem), the product of two connected spaces is connected, and the product of two metric spaces is metrizable.\n*   **Composant:** This is the most critical concept. For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all *proper* subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`.\n    *   A subcontinuum is a subset of `X` that is itself a continuum.\n    *   A *proper* subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the whole space `X`.\n    *   The relation \"being in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, so the composants partition the space `X`.\n\n### Step 2: Relating Composants to Decomposability\n\nThe number of composants a continuum has is directly related to whether it is \"decomposable\" or \"indecomposable\".\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. That is, `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are both proper subcontinua of `X`.\n    *   **Theorem:** A continuum has **exactly one** composant if and only if it is decomposable.\n    *   *Example:* The interval `I = [0, 1]` is decomposable because `I = [0, 2/3] ∪ [1/3, 1]`. Both `[0, 2/3]` and `[1/3, 1]` are proper subcontinua. Therefore, `[0, 1]` has only one composant.\n\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is indecomposable if it is not decomposable.\n    *   **Theorem (Mazurkiewicz's Theorem):** Every indecomposable metric continuum has **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., the size of the set of real numbers) pairwise disjoint composants. Furthermore, each of these `c` composants is a dense subset of the continuum.\n    *   *Example:* The Knaster continuum (buckethandle) and the pseudo-arc are classic examples of indecomposable continua.\n\n### Step 3: Posing the Core Question in a New Light\n\nBased on Step 2, the number of composants of a continuum is either 1 or `c`. Therefore, the question \"What is the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua `X × Y`?\" is equivalent to answering the following question:\n\n**\"Can the product space `X × Y` be indecomposable?\"**\n\nIf `X × Y` can be made indecomposable, then the maximum number of composants is `c`. If `X × Y` is always decomposable, the number is always 1.\n\n### Step 4: Using the Key Theorem on Product Spaces\n\nA crucial theorem by topologist R. H. Bing (1951) addresses the decomposability of product spaces.\n\n*   **Bing's Theorem:** Let `X` and `Y` be continua. The product space `X × Y` is indecomposable **if and only if** both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable continua.\n\nThis theorem provides a clear path to the solution.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing the Example for the Maximum Number\n\nTo achieve the largest possible number of composants for `Z = X × Y`, we need to make `Z` an indecomposable continuum.\n\n1.  According to Bing's theorem, `Z` is indecomposable if we choose both `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable continua.\n2.  The problem requires `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate. All indecomposable continua are necessarily nondegenerate. (A degenerate, single-point continuum is decomposable in a trivial sense, and a two-point space is not a continuum as it's not connected).\n3.  Indecomposable continua exist. We can choose `X` to be the pseudo-arc and `Y` to be the pseudo-arc (or any other indecomposable continua like the Knaster buckethandle).\n4.  With this choice, both `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate indecomposable continua.\n5.  Therefore, their product `Z = X × Y` is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n\nSince we have constructed a product space `Z = X × Y` that is an indecomposable continuum, we can apply Mazurkiewicz's theorem to `Z`.\n\n*   An indecomposable metric continuum has `c` composants.\n*   The number of composants is either 1 (for decomposable) or `c` (for indecomposable).\n*   Thus, the largest possible number is `c`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correctly define composant:** It relies on the union of *proper* subcontinua.\n2.  **Connect the number of composants to (in)decomposability:** This is the critical insight. The number isn't arbitrary; it's either 1 or `c` for a metric continuum.\n3.  **Identify the relevant theorem for product spaces:** Bing's theorem on the indecomposability of products is the key to solving the problem.\n4.  **Verify that the construction is valid:** The question requires `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate continua. We must ensure our choice (indecomposable continua) satisfies this. It does.\n5.  **Use the correct cardinality:** The number of composants in an indecomposable metric continuum is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum, not aleph-null or any other infinite cardinal.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<c>>>"
