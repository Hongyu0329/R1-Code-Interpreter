    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Interpret the Question\n\nThe question asks for the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) which is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\)\".\n\n*   **Graph G**: The graph we are analyzing.\n*   **Cycles of length n (\\(C_n\\))**: These are the building blocks of G. A cycle graph with \\(n\\) vertices has a chromatic number that depends on whether \\(n\\) is even or odd.\n*   **Sum of graphs**: This is the most critical term to interpret. In graph theory, \"sum\" can have several meanings. The most common interpretation that fits an algebraic-style phrasing like this is the **graph join** operation, often denoted by a '+' sign.\n    *   **Graph Join (\\(G_1 + G_2\\))**: Given two graphs \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) with disjoint vertex sets, their join \\(G_1 + G_2\\) is formed by taking their disjoint union and adding all possible edges between the vertices of \\(G_1\\) and the vertices of \\(G_2\\).\n*   **Maximal chromatic number**: This indicates that we should choose the parameter \\(n\\) (or its properties, such as parity) in a way that maximizes the chromatic number of \\(G\\).\n\nLet's assume \"sum\" refers to the graph join. Thus, \\(G = C_n + C_n + C_n\\), where the three cycles are disjoint.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Formula for the Chromatic Number of a Graph Join\n\nA fundamental property of the graph join operation is that its chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs.\nFor any two graphs \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\):\n\\[ \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\]\nThis is because any valid coloring of the joined graph must use a set of colors for the vertices of \\(G_1\\) that is completely disjoint from the set of colors used for the vertices of \\(G_2\\). This is required because every vertex in \\(G_1\\) is connected to every vertex in \\(G_2\\).\n\nSince the join operation is associative, we can extend this to three graphs:\n\\[ \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n + C_n + C_n) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\(\\chi(C_n)\\))\n\nThe value of \\(\\chi(G)\\) now depends entirely on the chromatic number of a cycle of length \\(n\\). We need to analyze \\(\\chi(C_n)\\).\n*   **Case A: n is an even number (\\(n \\ge 4\\))**\n    If a cycle has an even number of vertices, it is a bipartite graph. We can color its vertices by alternating between two colors. Therefore, the chromatic number is 2.\n    \\[ \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\quad (\\text{for even } n) \\]\n*   **Case B: n is an odd number (\\(n \\ge 3\\))**\n    If a cycle has an odd number of vertices, it is not bipartite, so at least three colors are needed. A 3-coloring is always possible (e.g., alternate two colors for the first \\(n-1\\) vertices, and use a third color for the last vertex). Therefore, the chromatic number is 3.\n    \\[ \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\quad (\\text{for odd } n) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Maximal Chromatic Number of G\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\), we need to choose the case for \\(n\\) (even or odd) that maximizes the value of \\(3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n)\\).\n\n*   If \\(n\\) is chosen to be **even**:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\]\n*   If \\(n\\) is chosen to be **odd**:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\]\n\nComparing the two possible outcomes, the maximum value is 9. This maximum is achieved whenever \\(n\\) is an odd integer (e.g., \\(n=3, 5, 7, \\dots\\)).\n\n### Careful Points and Alternative Interpretations\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Sum\"**: The choice of \"join\" for \"sum\" is crucial. If \"sum\" were interpreted as the **union of edge sets** on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices, the problem would be different. In that case, one could show that the maximal chromatic number is 7, achieved for \\(n=7\\) when the union of three 7-cycles forms a complete graph \\(K_7\\). However, the \"join\" operation is a more standard interpretation for the term \"graph sum\" in many contexts, and it leads to a more general result that depends only on the parity of \\(n\\), not a specific value. Given the phrasing, the \"join\" is the most likely intended operation.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximal chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum (join) of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is obtained when the cycles have an odd length, which gives them a chromatic number of 3 each. The total chromatic number is the sum of the three, leading to a maximum value of 9."
