    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Simplex Category $\\Delta$ as a 2-Category**\n\n*   **Objects (0-cells):** The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite, non-empty, totally ordered sets $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n*   **Morphisms (1-cells):** For any two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$, a morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., for any $i, j \\in [m]$, if $i \\le j$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$.\n*   **2-Morphisms (2-cells):** The category $\\Delta$ is viewed as a *locally posetal 2-subcategory of* $\\mathsf{Pos}$. This means that for any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, the set of 2-morphisms between them is a poset. In this specific case, there is a unique 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order, i.e., $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. Otherwise, there is no 2-morphism.\n\n**2. Defining an Internal Adjunction in $\\Delta$**\n\nAn internal adjunction from an object $X$ to an object $Y$ in a 2-category consists of:\n*   A pair of morphisms (1-cells) $f: X \\to Y$ and $g: Y \\to X$.\n*   Two 2-morphisms, called the unit ($\\eta$) and the counit ($\\varepsilon$).\n\nIn our case, $X = [23]$ and $Y = [37]$. So we need:\n*   An order-preserving map $f: [23] \\to [37]$.\n*   An order-preserving map $g: [37] \\to [23]$.\n*   A unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\to g \\circ f$.\n*   A counit 2-morphism $\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$.\n\nThe existence of these 2-morphisms, according to the structure of $\\Delta$, translates to the following pointwise inequalities:\n*   **Unit condition:** $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\le g \\circ f \\implies i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [23]$.\n*   **Counit condition:** $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]} \\implies f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [37]$.\n\nThe triangle identities for the adjunction are required to hold, but in a posetal 2-category like this one, they are automatically satisfied if the unit and counit exist. Therefore, an internal adjunction is completely characterized by a pair of order-preserving maps $(f,g)$ satisfying these two inequalities.\n\n**3. Connection to Adjunctions in the Category of Posets ($\\mathsf{Pos}$)**\n\nThe conditions derived above are precisely the conditions for the pair $(f,g)$ to be an adjoint pair in the category $\\mathsf{Pos}$, where $f$ is the left adjoint to $g$. This is often summarized by the equivalence:\n$f(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le g(y)$ for all $x \\in [23], y \\in [37]$.\nIt can be shown that this equivalence holds if and only if the unit and counit inequalities hold for order-preserving maps $f$ and $g$.\n\n**4. Characterizing Adjoint Maps Between Finite Ordinals**\n\nFor an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all colimits (joins). Similarly, for $g: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint, it must preserve all limits (meets).\n*   Since $[m]$ and $[n]$ are totally ordered, any order-preserving map preserves non-empty joins and meets.\n*   The crucial condition comes from preserving the *empty join* (for left adjoints) or the *empty meet* (for right adjoints).\n    *   The empty join is the initial object (or bottom element). The initial object of $[k]$ is $0$. A left adjoint $f: [23] \\to [37]$ must preserve the initial object, so it must satisfy $f(0) = 0$.\n    *   The empty meet is the terminal object (or top element). The terminal object of $[k]$ is $k$. A right adjoint $g: [37] \\to [23]$ must preserve the terminal object, so it must satisfy $g(37) = 23$.\n\nAn adjunction is determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, the number of adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is equal to the number of possible left adjoint maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$.\n\n**5. Counting the Left Adjoints**\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy the condition $f(0)=0$.\n*   An order-preserving map $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is determined by the sequence of values $(f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23))$.\n*   The condition is that $f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$. The values must be in $[37]$, i.e., between $0$ and $37$.\n*   The left adjoint condition imposes $f(0) = 0$.\n*   So we are counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $(f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23))$ such that $0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n*   This is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing items with repetition. We need to choose 23 values (for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$) from the set of possible outcomes $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n*   The number of items to choose is $k = 23$.\n*   The number of options to choose from is $n = 37 - 0 + 1 = 38$.\n*   The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $n$ with repetition allowed is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n    $$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} $$\n*   Substituting our values:\n    $$ \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n**6. Verification using Right Adjoints**\n\nWe can verify this result by counting the number of right adjoints $g: [37] \\to [23]$.\n*   A right adjoint must be an order-preserving map satisfying $g(37)=23$.\n*   We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $(g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(37))$ such that $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le g(37) = 23$.\n*   This is equivalent to choosing 37 values (for $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n*   Number of items to choose: $k=37$.\n*   Number of options: $n = 23 - 0 + 1 = 24$.\n*   The number of ways is:\n    $$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\n*   Using the binomial identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we see that $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\nThe two methods yield the same result, confirming our analysis.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<## $\\binom{60}{23}$"
