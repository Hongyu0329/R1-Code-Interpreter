The proposed filtering strategy is to first perform a paired differential expression analysis comparing the `CAR_IL15` group against the `CAR_only` group, ensuring the `CAR_only` group is the reference for the log2 fold change (LFC) calculation. After generating the results table, visualize the data with a volcano plot to identify a cluster of genes with large negative LFC values that are distinct from the main distribution of biological changes. Based on this visualization, select a stringent negative LFC threshold (e.g., -5.0). Finally, use a command-line tool like `awk` to filter the differential expression results file, removing any gene that falls below this LFC threshold. The `awk` command for a tab-separated file where LFC is the third column would be: `awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS="\t"} NR == 1 || $3 > -5.0' [input_file] > [output_file]`. It is highly recommended to inspect the list of removed genes to validate that they are known markers of the contaminating cancer cell line.
