    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the nature of the space X**\n*   $X$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, which is a complex manifold of complex dimension 3. A hypersurface is a submanifold of complex codimension 1. Therefore, $X$ is a complex manifold of dimension 2.\n*   As a real manifold, the dimension of $X$ is $2 \\times (\\text{complex dim}) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   A smooth complex manifold is always orientable. Since $X$ is a closed submanifold of a compact space ($\\mathbb{CP}^3$), it is also compact.\n*   So, $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-dimensional manifold.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the rank of a homotopy group to a Betti number**\nThe question asks for the rank of the abelian group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group $A$ is defined as the dimension of the rational vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe **Rational Hurewicz Theorem** provides a powerful connection between rational homotopy groups and rational homology groups. For a **simply connected** space $Y$ (i.e., $\\pi_1(Y) = 0$), the rational Hurewicz map\n$$h \\otimes 1: \\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\longrightarrow H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Q})$$\nis an isomorphism for all $k \\ge 1$.\nTherefore, if we can show that $X$ is simply connected, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})) = b_3(X) $$\nwhere $b_3(X)$ is the third Betti number of $X$. Our goal is now to check if $X$ is simply connected and then compute $b_3(X)$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that X is simply connected**\nWe use the **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem**. This theorem relates the topology of a smooth complex projective variety to the topology of a smooth hyperplane section. A more general version relates the topology of a subvariety to the ambient space.\nFor a smooth complex hypersurface $X$ of complex dimension $m$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^{m+1}$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^{m+1}$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups\n$$i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\longrightarrow \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^{m+1})$$\nfor all $k < m$.\nIn our case, $X$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so its complex dimension is $m=2$. The theorem states that the map $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 2$. For $k=1$, we have:\n$$i_*: \\pi_1(X) \\stackrel{\\cong}{\\longrightarrow} \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$$\nThe fundamental group of complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is trivial for any $n \\ge 1$. Thus, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$.\nThis implies $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. So, $X$ is simply connected.\n\n**Careful Point:** The Lefschetz theorem requires $X$ to be a *smooth* hypersurface, which is given in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the third Betti number $b_3(X)$**\nNow that we have established that $X$ is simply connected, we can proceed to calculate $b_3(X)$.\n1.  We know $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-manifold. **Poincaré Duality** applies to such manifolds. It gives an isomorphism between homology and cohomology groups:\n    $$H_k(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^{4-k}(X; \\mathbb{Q})$$\n    For $k=3$, this gives $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^1(X; \\mathbb{Q})$. The dimension of these vector spaces are the Betti numbers, so $b_3(X) = b^1(X)$.\n\n2.  The **Universal Coefficient Theorem** for cohomology relates cohomology to homology:\n    $$H^1(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Q}), \\mathbb{Q})$$\n\n3.  We need to find $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Q})$. The Hurewicz theorem (in its classical form) states that for a path-connected space $Y$, the abelianization of its fundamental group is isomorphic to its first singular homology group:\n    $$(\\pi_1(Y))_{\\text{ab}} \\cong H_1(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$$\n    Since we found that $\\pi_1(X)=0$, its abelianization is also the trivial group. So, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\n4.  The rational homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is related to the integral homology group by $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. Since $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, we have $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n\n5.  Substituting this back into the expression for $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Q})$:\n    $$H^1(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(0, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$$\n    So, $b^1(X) = 0$.\n\n6.  From Poincaré Duality, we have $b_3(X) = b^1(X) = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**\nFrom Step 2, we established that $\\operatorname{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$ because $X$ is simply connected.\nFrom Step 4, we calculated $b_3(X)=0$.\nTherefore, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\n**Final check on the careful points:**\n*   The use of the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem is valid for a smooth quintic hypersurface.\n*   The applicability of the Rational Hurewicz Theorem depends on $X$ being simply connected, which we've shown.\n*   Poincaré Duality is applicable because $X$ is a compact, orientable manifold.\n*   The argument flows logically from well-established theorems in algebraic topology. The specific degree of the hypersurface (quintic, i.e., degree 5) was not needed for this particular calculation, other than ensuring it's a well-defined object. The result holds for any smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\nFinal Answer is 0."
