    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the core question:** The prompt states, \"The title is a question, in alphabetical order what is the answer?\". This is the central instruction for solving the puzzle.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Title:** The title is \"The Bays\". For this to be a question, we must look for a play on words. \"The Bays\" is a homophone for \"The B's\". Therefore, the riddle is asking: **\"What are the B's?\"** The answer must be found within the lines of the haiku, and it will consist of words that start with the letter 'B'.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Haiku Line by Line:** We need to find one 'B' word or concept from each line of the haiku.\n\n    *   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n        *   **Analysis:** This line describes a powerful, windy storm. It doesn't contain a word that starts with 'B'. However, it describes an action. What does a tempest do? A tempest **blows**. This word fits the description and starts with 'B'.\n        *   **First 'B' word:** Blows\n\n    *   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n        *   **Analysis:** This line is more direct. The number \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30, which serves as a distractor. The key is the literal word **brings**, which is present in the line and starts with 'B'.\n        *   **Second 'B' word:** Brings\n\n    *   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n        *   **Analysis:** This line is conceptual. \"A divine one\" refers to a deity or a god. The word \"yields\" means to give or produce. What does a divine being yield? A common answer is **blessings**. This word fits the theme of the line and starts with 'B'.\n        *   **Third 'B' word:** Blessings\n\n4.  **Assemble and Order the Final Answer:** The final instruction is to present the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n\n    *   We have found three 'B' words: Blows, Brings, Blessings.\n    *   Arranging them alphabetically gives us: Blessings, Blows, Brings.\n\n**List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **The Title is a Homophone:** The crucial first step is recognizing that \"The Bays\" is meant to be heard as \"The B's\".\n*   **Three Types of Clues:** The puzzle is designed with varying difficulty. One clue is literal (brings), one is descriptive (a tempest blows), and one is thematic (a divine one yields blessings).\n*   **Ignoring Distractors:** Elements like \"August\" and \"Twice fifteen\" (30) are intended to distract from the main clues.\n*   **Alphabetical Order:** The final instruction to alphabetize the results is essential and must not be overlooked.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Question:** What are \"The B's\"?\n*   **Clues from Haiku:** Blows, Brings, Blessings.\n*   **Alphabetize the Clues:** Blessings, Blows, Brings.\n*   **Final Answer:** The final answer is the alphabetically ordered list of the three words.\n\n<<<Blessings, Blows, Brings>>>"
