    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question's Constraints\n\nThe question has several key components:\n1.  **First book in the Bible:** We must identify a specific book (e.g., Genesis, Romans).\n2.  **In canonical order:** This is the most crucial constraint. We must start from the beginning of the Bible (Genesis) and proceed in order. The first book we find that is named is the answer, regardless of whether later books are mentioned more explicitly. The Protestant canon, familiar to Shakespeare, is the standard to use.\n3.  **Mentioned by name:** The title of the book must be used, not just an allusion to its content or characters. A clear pun on the title can be considered a mention.\n4.  **In a Shakespeare play:** The reference must come from one of Shakespeare's plays.\n5.  **Which play is it mentioned in?:** We must also identify the specific play.\n\n### Step 2: Begin Searching in Canonical Order\n\nWe will proceed through the books of the Old Testament as they appear in the Bible.\n\n*   **Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus:** A search of Shakespeare’s works reveals no instance where these books are mentioned by their titles. While there are countless allusions to their stories (Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, Moses), the books themselves are not named.\n\n*   **Numbers:** We now come to the fourth book of the Bible. In Shakespeare's early comedy, *Love's Labour's Lost*, there is a significant reference. In Act IV, Scene 3, Berowne, upon discovering that his three scholarly friends have all broken their vows by falling in love, mocks them. He addresses them as \"book-men\" and asks:\n    > \"Have you been studying **Numbers** of the sea,\n    > Wherein a man may note all parts o’ th’ land,\n    > And never see the sea from any land?\"\n\n    **Careful Point:** Is this a valid mention? Yes. Berowne specifically calls them \"book-men,\" setting up a literary or scholarly context. He then uses the word \"Numbers,\" which is capitalized in most modern editions to signify the title. This is a clear pun, playing on the biblical book's name and the general idea of counting or surveying. For the purposes of being \"mentioned by name,\" a pun is a valid form of reference.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Subsequent Books to Confirm the \"First\"\n\nSince we have found a mention of **Numbers**, and it is the first book in the canon to be named, our search is technically complete. However, for the sake of thoroughness, let's look at other known biblical references in Shakespeare to see where they fall in the canon.\n\n*   **The Book of Job:** In *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act V, Scene 5), Falstaff complains, \"I am as poor as **Job**, my lord, but not so patient.\"\n    **Careful Point:** This refers to the person Job, famous for his poverty and patience, rather than explicitly naming the book as a text. While the book is named for him, this is considered an allusion to a character, which is different from naming the text itself. Furthermore, Job comes after Numbers in the biblical canon.\n\n*   **The Book of Psalms:** In *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act II, Scene 1), Mistress Ford declares she will \"sing **Psalms** to horn-pipes.\"\n    **Careful Point:** This is a plausible mention of the book by its common title. However, the Book of Psalms comes after the Book of Numbers in the canon.\n\n*   **The Book of Proverbs:** In *Henry IV, Part 2* (Act I, Scene 2), Falstaff provides the most explicit reference to a biblical book in all of Shakespeare. He says:\n    > \"...it is written in the Book of **Proverbs**, 'He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it.'\"\n    **Careful Point:** This reference is direct and unambiguous. However, the Book of Proverbs appears much later in the Old Testament than the Book of Numbers. The question asks for the *first in canonical order*, not the most explicit.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the canonical ordering of the Bible, the first book to be mentioned by name is **Numbers**. Although the reference is a pun, it is a deliberate mention of the book's title in a suitable context. All other potential candidates, such as Job, Psalms, or Proverbs, appear later in the biblical canon.\n\n**The first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name is Numbers.**\n**It is mentioned in the play *Love's Labour's Lost*.**\n\n<<<The first book mentioned by name is Numbers, in the play Love's Labour's Lost.>>>"
