    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Problem and Constraints**\n\nFirst, let's define the board and the rules for queens attacking.\n\n*   **Board**: A 5x5 grid. We can label the squares with coordinates `(r, c)` where `r` (row) and `c` (column) are integers from 0 to 4.\n*   **Toroidal**: The board wraps around. This means calculations for position are done modulo 5. For example, the column to the right of column 4 is column 0, and the row below row 4 is row 0.\n*   **Non-Attacking Queens**: Four queens are non-attacking if no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.\n    *   **Rows**: All four queens must be in different rows.\n    *   **Columns**: All four queens must be in different columns.\n    *   **Diagonals**: On a toroidal board, the diagonals are defined by squares `(r, c)` where `r+c` is constant (modulo 5) or `r-c` is constant (modulo 5). So, for any two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`, we must have:\n        *   `r1 ≠ r2`\n        *   `c1 ≠ c2`\n        *   `r1 + c1 ≢ r2 + c2 (mod 5)`\n        *   `r1 - c1 ≢ r2 - c2 (mod 5)`\n\nOur goal is to find the number of sets of four coordinates `{(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)}` that satisfy all these conditions.\n\n### **2. Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   The toroidal nature of the board is the most critical and complex feature. Standard n-queens problem solutions do not apply directly.\n*   The problem involves placing 4 queens on a 5x5 board. This is an `(n-1)`-queens on an `n x n` board problem. This structure is a key hint.\n*   The problem is about counting configurations (sets of squares), so the queens are indistinguishable.\n*   A direct brute-force check of all `C(25, 4)` placements would be computationally intensive and error-prone. A more structured, mathematical approach is needed.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis: Relating the 4-Queen to the 5-Queen Problem**\n\nThe most elegant way to solve this is to relate the 4-queen problem to the 5-queen problem on the same board.\n\n**Step 3.1: The Completion Argument**\n\nConsider any valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens.\n*   Because there are 4 queens, there are 4 occupied rows and **one unique empty row**, let's call it `r₀`.\n*   Similarly, there is **one unique empty column**, `c₀`.\n*   The four \"sum\" diagonals `(r+c) mod 5` occupied by the queens must be distinct. This leaves **one unique empty sum diagonal**, `s₀`.\n*   The four \"difference\" diagonals `(r-c) mod 5` occupied by the queens must also be distinct, leaving **one unique empty difference diagonal**, `d₀`.\n\nNow, let's consider the square at the intersection of the empty row and column: `(r₀, c₀)`. Does placing a 5th queen here result in a valid 5-queen placement? Let's check:\n1.  The queen at `(r₀, c₀)` does not attack any other queen by row, as row `r₀` was empty.\n2.  It does not attack any other queen by column, as column `c₀` was empty.\n3.  We need to check if its diagonals `r₀+c₀` and `r₀-c₀` were also empty.\n\nLet the coordinates of the four queens be `(r₁, c₁), (r₂, c₂), (r₃, c₄)`. The sum of all row indices on the board is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`. The sum of the occupied row indices is `r₁+r₂+r₃+r₄ = 10 - r₀ ≡ -r₀ (mod 5)`. The same logic applies to columns, sum diagonals, and difference diagonals.\n\n*   **Sum Diagonal:** The sum of the occupied sum diagonals is `(r₁+c₁)+...+(r₄+c₄) = (r₁+...+r₄) + (c₁+...+c₄) ≡ (-r₀) + (-c₀) ≡ -(r₀+c₀) (mod 5)`. The sum of all five possible sum diagonals is `0+1+2+3+4=10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`. Therefore, the value of the empty diagonal `s₀` must be `0 - (sum of occupied diagonals) ≡ -(-(r₀+c₀)) ≡ r₀+c₀ (mod 5)`. This proves the new queen's sum diagonal `r₀+c₀` is exactly the empty one `s₀`.\n*   **Difference Diagonal:** The sum of the occupied difference diagonals is `(r₁-c₁)+...+(r₄-c₄) = (r₁+...+r₄) - (c₁+...+c₄) ≡ (-r₀) - (-c₀) ≡ c₀-r₀ (mod 5)`. The value of the empty diagonal `d₀` must be `0 - (sum of occupied diagonals) ≡ -(c₀-r₀) ≡ r₀-c₀ (mod 5)`. This proves the new queen's difference diagonal `r₀-c₀` is exactly the empty one `d₀`.\n\nThis shows that any valid 4-queen placement can be \"completed\" to a valid 5-queen placement by adding a queen to the unique empty row and column. This completion is unique.\n\n**Step 3.2: Solving the 5-Queen Problem**\n\nNow we need to find the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. A placement can be described by a function `p(r) = c`, where for each row `r`, `p(r)` gives the column `c` of the queen. Since there is one queen per row and column, `p` must be a permutation of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\nThe non-attacking conditions mean that `p(r)`, `r+p(r)`, and `r-p(r)` must all be permutations as functions of `r`.\n\nFor a prime-sized board like 5x5, it is a known mathematical result that all such permutations `p` must be affine functions of the form:\n`p(r) = a*r + b (mod 5)`\n\nLet's find the valid values for `a` and `b`:\n*   `b` can be any value in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` (5 choices). This corresponds to a vertical shift of the entire pattern.\n*   For `p(r)` to be a permutation, `a` cannot be 0. So `a ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   For `r+p(r) = r + (ar+b) = (a+1)r + b` to be a permutation, `a+1` must not be 0 (mod 5). So `a ≠ -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`.\n*   For `r-p(r) = r - (ar+b) = (1-a)r - b` to be a permutation, `1-a` must not be 0 (mod 5). So `a ≠ 1 (mod 5)`.\n\nCombining these constraints, `a` can only be **2** or **3**.\n*   Number of choices for `a`: 2\n*   Number of choices for `b`: 5\n\nTotal number of 5-queen solutions = `2 * 5 = 10`.\n\n**Step 3.3: Final Calculation**\n\nWe have established a clear relationship:\n*   Every valid 4-queen placement can be uniquely completed to one of the 10 valid 5-queen placements.\n*   Conversely, every valid 5-queen placement can generate 5 distinct 4-queen placements by removing any one of its 5 queens.\n\nLet `S₄` be the set of 4-queen solutions and `S₅` be the set of 5-queen solutions. The relationship shows that the total number of 4-queen placements is the number of 5-queen placements multiplied by 5.\n\nNumber of ways = (Number of 5-queen solutions) × 5\nNumber of ways = 10 × 5 = 50.\n\nThe process of generating 4-queen solutions from different 5-queen solutions will never produce the same result (no double counting), because each 4-queen solution has a *unique* completion.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
