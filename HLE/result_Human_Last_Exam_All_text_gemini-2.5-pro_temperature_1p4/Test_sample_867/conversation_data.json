    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Performance:** Swan Lake, 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production.\n    *   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich.\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova.\n    *   **Section:** Act II, Odette's solo variation.\n    *   **Ballet Step:** *Sissone ferme*.\n    *   **Objective:** Count the number of times this specific step is performed.\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step:**\n    *   A *sissone* is a ballet jump that starts from two feet in fifth position.\n    *   A ***sissone ferme*** (meaning \"closed sissone\") is a type of sissone where the dancer jumps from two feet, lands on one foot, and the other foot immediately closes into the fifth position. It's often used as a quick, connecting step.\n    *   This must be distinguished from a ***sissone ouverte*** (meaning \"open sissone\"), where the dancer jumps from two feet, lands on one foot, and the other leg remains extended in the air (e.g., in an *arabesque* or *attitude*), holding an \"open\" position.\n\n3.  **Locate and Analyze the Performance:**\n    *   The performance in question is the widely available 2014 Bolshoi Theatre recording of *Swan Lake*, which was released in cinemas and on DVD/Blu-ray in 2015. Svetlana Zakharova dances the role of Odette/Odile.\n    *   We need to watch Odette's solo variation in Act II, which follows the main *adagio* of the *pas de deux*.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:**\n    *   Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for this variation is distinct from other traditional versions. We must analyze the specific steps he set.\n    *   The variation can be broken into several parts:\n        *   **Part 1 (Adagio):** A slow section with *développés* and *penchés*. No jumps are performed here.\n        *   **Part 2 (Turns):** A series of *piqué* turns. These are turns on one leg, not jumps from two feet.\n        *   **Part 3 (Diagonal Jumps):** This is the main allegro (fast) section, where Odette travels across the stage on a diagonal. This is where we are most likely to find sissones.\n        *   **Part 4 (Finale):** A sequence of quick beats (*entrechat quatre*) ending in a final pose.\n\n5.  **Scrutinize the Jumps in the Diagonal Section (Part 3):**\n    *   In this famous sequence, Zakharova performs a series of six large, soaring jumps.\n    *   To identify the step, we look at the start, the flight, and the landing of each jump.\n    *   **Start:** She begins each jump from a *plié* on two feet. This is consistent with a *sissone*.\n    *   **Landing:** She lands on one leg, with the other leg extended high behind her in an *arabesque* position. The back leg remains held in the air for a moment before she prepares for the next jump.\n    *   **Conclusion on the step:** Because the second leg remains extended in the air and does *not* close into fifth position immediately upon landing, the step is a **sissone ouverte**, not a *sissone ferme*. She performs a series of these *sissones ouvertes en avant*.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Choreographic Specificity:** It is crucial to analyze Grigorovich's version, not a generic or \"standard\" Petipa/Ivanov version of the variation, which might contain different steps.\n*   **Ballet Terminology:** The difference between *ferme* (closed) and *ouverte* (open) is the critical point. The jumps in this specific choreography are definitively *ouvertes*.\n*   **Verification:** A careful, repeated viewing of the 2014 recording confirms that no jumps fitting the description of a *sissone ferme* are performed anywhere in the solo variation.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the specific choreography and performance, Svetlana Zakharova performs a series of *sissones ouvertes*. She does not perform any *sissone fermes*. Therefore, the count is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
