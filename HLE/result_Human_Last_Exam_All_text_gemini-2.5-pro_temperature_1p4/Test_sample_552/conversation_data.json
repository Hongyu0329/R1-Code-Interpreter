    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific paper in question:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The official title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This was one of his four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers.\n\n2.  **Examine the paper for citations:** A direct analysis of this 1905 paper reveals that, like his paper on special relativity from the same year, it does not contain a formal bibliography or footnotes citing other scientists' work. The citation practices in German physics journals at the time were less rigorous than they are today. Therefore, there is no *explicit, formal citation* in the modern sense within the paper itself.\n\n3.  **Identify the core theory used by Einstein:** The entire foundation of Einstein's paper is the \"molecular-kinetic theory of heat.\" This theory, which explains macroscopic properties of matter (like heat and pressure) as consequences of the motion of atoms and molecules, was primarily developed and championed by the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. Einstein's paper provided powerful theoretical evidence for this theory and, by extension, for the very existence of atoms.\n\n4.  **Connect the theory to the term \"lectures\":** Ludwig Boltzmann's most comprehensive and influential work on this subject was a two-volume book published in 1896 and 1898. The title of this book is ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie***, which translates to ***Lectures on Gas Theory***. This work is the definitive summary of his ideas that form the basis of Einstein's paper.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the information to answer the question:** Although Einstein did not include a formal citation to Boltzmann in the 1905 paper, he was working directly within the framework established by Boltzmann's \"lectures\" (i.e., his book *Lectures on Gas Theory*). The paper is a direct application of the principles laid out by Boltzmann. Furthermore, in a subsequent paper published in 1906 that expanded on his work on Brownian motion, Einstein *did* explicitly cite Boltzmann's *Lectures on Gas Theory*. Therefore, the person whose lectures form the intellectual foundation of the paper, and who he later explicitly cited for this work, is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Implicit vs. Explicit Citation:** The key point of confusion is the meaning of \"cite.\" If it means a formal reference within the text, the answer would be \"no one.\" However, given the context and the foundational nature of the work used, \"cite\" is better interpreted as \"referencing the ideas of\" or \"basing the work upon.\"\n*   **1905 vs. 1906 Paper:** It is important not to confuse the 1905 paper (which lacks an explicit citation) with the 1906 follow-up paper (which contains one). The 1906 citation confirms the intellectual debt in the 1905 work.\n*   **\"Lectures\" as a Book Title:** The term \"lectures\" refers to the title of Boltzmann's published book, *Lectures on Gas Theory*, not necessarily lectures Einstein personally attended.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy understanding that the paper is a direct application of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, and that the definitive work on this theory was Ludwig Boltzmann's book *Lectures on Gas Theory*, we can conclude that he is the person whose lectures were foundational to Einstein's paper.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
