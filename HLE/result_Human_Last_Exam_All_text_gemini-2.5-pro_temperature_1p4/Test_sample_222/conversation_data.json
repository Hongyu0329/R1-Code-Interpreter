    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Identify the Input Data:**\n    *   We have two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   We are given their 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n    *   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Target Sequence:**\n    *   We need to find the DFT of a new sequence, let's call it `y(n)`.\n    *   The sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n        `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n    *   This is an 8-point sequence (`n` from 0 to 7).\n\n3.  **Clarify the Goal:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of this 8-point sequence `y(n)`. This is a typo. The length of the DFT must match the length of the sequence. Therefore, the task is to find the **8-point DFT** of `y(n)`. Let's call this `Y(k)`.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step 1: Express the new sequence `y(n)` in terms of `x(n)` and `h(n)`**\n\nThe interleaved sequence `y(n)` can be described as:\n*   For even indices `n = 2m`: `y(2m) = x(m)` where `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   For odd indices `n = 2m + 1`: `y(2m + 1) = h(m)` where `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n**Step 2: Use the DFT definition to relate `Y(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`**\n\nThe 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is defined as:\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) W_8^{nk}$  where  $W_N = e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}}$\n\nWe can split the summation into even and odd parts of `n`:\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) W_8^{(2m)k} + \\sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) W_8^{(2m+1)k}$\n\nSubstitute `x(m)` and `h(m)` into the equation:\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) W_8^{2mk} + \\sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) W_8^{(2m+1)k}$\n\nSimplify the twiddle factors. Note that $W_8^2 = e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{8} \\cdot 2} = e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{4}} = W_4$.\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) (W_8^2)^{mk} + \\sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) W_8^k (W_8^2)^{mk}$\n$Y(k) = \\sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) W_4^{mk} + W_8^k \\sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) W_4^{mk}$\n\nThe summations are the 4-point DFTs of `x(m)` and `h(m)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)`. Since `X(k)` and `H(k)` are 4-periodic, the formula holds for `k` from 0 to 7 by using `k mod 4`.\n$Y(k) = X(k \\pmod 4) + W_8^k H(k \\pmod 4)$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required twiddle factors `W_8^k`**\n*   $W_8^0 = 1$\n*   $W_8^1 = e^{-j\\pi/4} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n*   $W_8^2 = e^{-j\\pi/2} = -j$\n*   $W_8^3 = e^{-j3\\pi/4} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n*   $W_8^4 = e^{-j\\pi} = -1$\n*   $W_8^5 = e^{-j5\\pi/4} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n*   $W_8^6 = e^{-j3\\pi/2} = j$\n*   $W_8^7 = e^{-j7\\pi/4} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate `Y(k)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`**\n\n*   **For k = 0:**\n    $Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1$\n*   **For k = 1:**\n    $Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 H(1) = j + \\left(\\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1+j) = j + \\frac{1-j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = j + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = j + \\sqrt{2}$\n*   **For k = 2:**\n    $Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j$\n*   **For k = 3:**\n    $Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 H(3) = -j + \\left(\\frac{-1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1-j) = -j + \\frac{-1+j-j+j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -j + \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -j - \\sqrt{2}$\n*   **For k = 4:**\n    $Y(4) = X(0) + W_8^4 H(0) = 1 + (-1)(0) = 1$\n*   **For k = 5:**\n    $Y(5) = X(1) + W_8^5 H(1) = j + \\left(\\frac{-1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1+j) = j + \\frac{-1-j+j+j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = j + \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2}} = j - \\sqrt{2}$\n*   **For k = 6:**\n    $Y(6) = X(2) + W_8^6 H(2) = -1 + (j)(1) = -1 + j$\n*   **For k = 7:**\n    $Y(7) = X(3) + W_8^7 H(3) = -j + \\left(\\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1-j) = -j + \\frac{1-j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -j + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -j + \\sqrt{2}$\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nCombining the results, the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is:\n`Y(k) = [1,  sqrt(2)+j,  -1-j,  -sqrt(2)-j,  1,  -sqrt(2)+j,  -1+j,  sqrt(2)-j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
