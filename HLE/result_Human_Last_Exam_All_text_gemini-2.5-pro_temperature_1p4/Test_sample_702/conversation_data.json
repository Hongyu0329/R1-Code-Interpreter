    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map**\n\n*   **Source Space:** $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   **Target Space:** $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n*   **The Map:** Let's call the map $f: X \\to Y$. This map is a well-known map in homotopy theory, sometimes called a secondary Samelson product or a Selick map. It arises naturally from the theory of iterated loop spaces. The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" hints at its origin in constructions like the fiber of $S^4 \\times S^6 \\to S^4 \\vee S^6$, which is homotopy equivalent to the source space $X$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the connectivity of the source and target spaces**\n\nThe connectivity of a space is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ up to dimension $k$ are trivial.\n\n*   **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^n$**: For a sphere $S^n$ ($n \\ge 2$), it is $(n-1)$-connected. The loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is therefore $(n-2)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2) = 2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2) = 4$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of a smash product**: If a space $A$ is $k_A$-connected and a space $B$ is $k_B$-connected, their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(k_A + k_B + 1)$-connected.\n    *   Let $W = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. Its connectivity is $(2 + 4 + 1) = 7$. So $W$ is 7-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of a suspension**: The suspension $\\Sigma A$ of a $k$-connected space $A$ is $(k+1)$-connected.\n    *   The source space is $X = \\Sigma W = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since $W$ is 7-connected, $X$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the target space**:\n    *   $S^4$ is 3-connected and $S^6$ is 5-connected.\n    *   $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is $(3+5+1)=9$-connected. It is also homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$.\n    *   The target space is $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   Since $S^{10}$ is 9-connected, its loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected.\n\nBoth the source space $X$ and the target space $Y$ are 8-connected. This means $\\pi_i(X) = 0$ and $\\pi_i(Y) = 0$ for all $i \\le 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the connectivity of the map**\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n\nSince both spaces are 8-connected, the map $f_*$ is trivially an isomorphism for all $i \\le 8$ (it is a map from 0 to 0). Thus, the connectivity of the map is at least 9. To determine the exact connectivity, we must check the behavior of $f_*$ on $\\pi_9, \\pi_{10}, \\pi_{11}$, etc.\n\n*   **Analysis of $f_*$ on $\\pi_9$**:\n    *   $\\pi_9(X) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Using the Hurewicz theorem and the KÃ¼nneth formula for homology, one can show that this group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_9(Y) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $f_*: \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Y)$ is an isomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. This is a standard (but non-trivial) result in homotopy theory concerning this map.\n    *   Since $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$, the connectivity of the map is at least 10.\n\n*   **Analysis of $f_*$ on $\\pi_{10}$**:\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(X) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. The space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ has the homotopy type of $S^8$ in low dimensions. From the homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_9(S^8) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Thus, $\\pi_{10}(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(Y) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. From the homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_{11}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   It is another known result that the map $f_*: \\pi_{10}(X) \\to \\pi_{10}(Y)$ is an isomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   Since $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_{10}$, the connectivity of the map is at least 11.\n\n*   **Analysis of $f_*$ on $\\pi_{11}$**:\n    *   $\\pi_{11}(X) = \\pi_{11}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Again, considering the low-dimensional structure of the space, we have $\\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^8) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The source group is non-zero.\n    *   $\\pi_{11}(Y) = \\pi_{11}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{12}(S^{10})$. A standard result for homotopy groups of spheres is that $\\pi_{12}(S^{10}) = 0$.\n    *   The map is $f_*: \\pi_{11}(X) \\to \\pi_{11}(Y)$, which is a map from a non-zero group (containing at least a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summand) to the zero group.\n    *   This map cannot be surjective.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the connectivity**\n\nThe map $f_*$ is an isomorphism for all $i < 11$. However, for $i=11$, the map is not a surjection. By the definition of the connectivity of a map, the connectivity is 11."
