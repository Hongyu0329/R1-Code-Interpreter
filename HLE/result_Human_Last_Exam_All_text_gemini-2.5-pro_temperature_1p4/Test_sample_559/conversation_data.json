    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the system.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System of Differential Equations**\nWe are given the system:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe analyze the system in the phase plane $(d, u)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find the possible values for $u$:\n$u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\nNow we find the corresponding $d$ values for each $u$.\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 2d^2$.\n    Setting $d' = 0$ gives $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point $P_1 = (0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d$.\n    Setting $d' = 0$ gives $2d(d+1) = 0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives two more equilibrium points: $P_2 = (0, 1)$ and $P_3 = (-1, 1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the Equilibrium Points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$ of the system.\nLet $F(d,u) = 2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3+u^4$ and $G(d,u) = u^3-u^2$.\n$J(d,u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   **At P1 = (0, 0):** $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This is a degenerate point.\n*   **At P2 = (0, 1):** $J(0,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2, \\lambda_2=1$. Since both are positive, $P_2$ is an **unstable node**.\n*   **At P3 = (-1, 1):** $J(-1,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2, \\lambda_2=1$. Since they have opposite signs, $P_3$ is a **saddle point**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Separatrix**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. Separatrices are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. In this case, the saddle point is $P_3 = (-1, 1)$. The separatrix is likely to be one of its manifolds.\n\nLet's search for an invariant curve, which is a curve that is also a trajectory of the system. Let's test a simple polynomial relationship between $d$ and $u$. We guess a quadratic relationship of the form $d = ku^2$.\nLet's try $d = -u^2$. To check if this is a solution curve, we must verify that it satisfies the differential equation for trajectories, or equivalently, show that if $d(t)=-u(t)^2$ and $u(t)$ satisfies $u' = u^2(u-1)$, then $d(t)$ satisfies its differential equation.\n\nIf $d = -u^2$, then using the chain rule, $d' = -2u u'$.\nSubstitute $u' = u^2(u-1) = u^3-u^2$:\n$d' = -2u(u^3-u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow, substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original equation for $d'$:\n$d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d' = 2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n$d' = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d' = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n$d' = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nThe expressions match. Thus, the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\n**Step 5: Relate the Invariant Curve to the Saddle Point**\nLet's see if this curve passes through any of the equilibrium points.\n*   For $P_1 = (0,0)$: If $u=0$, then $d=-(0)^2=0$. Yes, it passes through $P_1$.\n*   For $P_3 = (-1,1)$: If $u=1$, then $d=-(1)^2=-1$. Yes, it passes through $P_3$.\n\nThe curve $d=-u^2$ is a trajectory that connects the saddle point $P_3$ to the degenerate point $P_1$. Such a connecting orbit involving a saddle point is a separatrix. Specifically, it can be shown to be the unstable manifold of the saddle point $P_3$. For $u \\in (0,1)$, we have $u'<0$, so the flow along this curve is from $P_3(-1,1)$ to $P_1(0,0)$.\n\nThe curve $d=-u^2$ separates the phase plane. Trajectories are attracted towards this curve, and their long-term behavior is to follow it to the origin. This specific trajectory connecting two equilibrium points, one of which is a saddle, is the most significant separatrix in the system's dynamics.\n\nFinal Answer: The separatrix is the curve given by the equation $d = -u^2$."
