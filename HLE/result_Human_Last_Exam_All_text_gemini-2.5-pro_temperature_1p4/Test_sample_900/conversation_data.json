    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of \"pas de Balanchines\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The question concerns the \"Jete Woman\" solo (the second female solo) from William Forsythe's ballet \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\". The specific performance is by Svetlana Gileva with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\n2.  **Define \"Pas de Balanchine\":** This is a crucial step as \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal term in the academic ballet vocabulary. It is a colloquial name used by dancers and coaches to refer to a specific, stylized version of a *pas de bourrée dessous* (a three-step sequence of back-side-front). This step was frequently used and popularized by choreographer George Balanchine. It is characterized by its speed, syncopation, sharp execution, and a noticeable use of the hips.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography:** William Forsythe's choreographic style is an evolution of the neoclassical style pioneered by Balanchine. Forsythe is famous for deconstructing the classical vocabulary—taking traditional steps, breaking them apart, and reassembling them in new, often off-balance and technically extreme ways.\n\n4.  **Scrutinize the \"Jete Woman\" Solo:** This solo is a prime example of Forsythe's style. It is renowned for its incredible difficulty, speed, and complex, fragmented footwork. It includes:\n    *   Explosive grand jetés (leaps).\n    *   Deep, off-balance lunges.\n    *   Rapid piqué and chaîné turns (chains of turns).\n    *   Complex transitional steps that connect these larger movements.\n\n5.  **Search for the \"Pas de Balanchine\" Step:** Watching the specific performance by Svetlana Gileva, we must look for the distinct three-step pattern (back-side-front) executed in the sharp, Balanchine-esque style.\n    *   The solo features numerous instances of fast footwork. However, this footwork is intentionally fragmented and non-traditional.\n    *   The dancer performs quick connecting steps, but these do not resolve into the recognizable pattern of a *pas de bourrée dessous*. For example, a step that begins as if it might be a pas de bourrée immediately morphs into a preparation for a turn or a slide into a lunge.\n    *   Forsythe's intention is to push the boundaries of classical technique, not to repeat its standard phrases. Therefore, the choreography deliberately avoids simple, countable, academic steps like a standard pas de bourrée.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the entire solo is infused with the speed and angular aesthetic reminiscent of Balanchine's work, a careful, step-by-step analysis of the choreography reveals that Svetlana Gileva does not perform any complete, recognizable \"pas de Balanchine\" (stylized *pas de bourrée dessous*) during the \"Jete Woman\" solo. The complex and deconstructed nature of the choreography means this specific step is not present.\n\n<<<0>>>"
