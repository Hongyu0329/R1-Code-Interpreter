    "An analysis of the question of finding the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:**\n    The curve given by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)` is known as a Lissajous curve. In this specific case, `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n2.  **Determine the period of the curve:**\n    The x-component, `cos(9t)`, has a period of `T_x = 2π/9`.\n    The y-component, `sin(5t)`, has a period of `T_y = 2π/5`.\n    The curve completes its entire path and starts to retrace itself after a time `T` which is the least common multiple of `T_x` and `T_y`.\n    `T = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π`.\n    Therefore, all self-intersections will occur for parameter values `t` within any interval of length `2π`, for example, `[0, 2π)`.\n\n3.  **Define a self-intersection point:**\n    A self-intersection occurs at a point `P(x, y)` if the curve passes through this point for two different parameter values, `t1` and `t2`, within the period `[0, 2π)`.\n    This means we are looking for the number of distinct points `(x, y)` for which there exist `t1 ≠ t2` in `[0, 2π)` such that:\n    `cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2)`\n    `sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2)`\n\n4.  **Use the standard formula for Lissajous curves:**\n    For Lissajous curves of the form `x(t) = cos(nt)` and `y(t) = sin(mt)`, there is a well-established formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points, provided certain conditions are met.\n    The conditions for the simplest version of the formula are:\n    *   `n` and `m` are integers.\n    *   `n` and `m` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n    *   `n` and `m` are both odd.\n\n5.  **Check the conditions for the given curve:**\n    For our curve, `n = 9` and `m = 5`.\n    *   `9` and `5` are integers. (Condition met)\n    *   `GCD(9, 5) = 1`. They are coprime. (Condition met)\n    *   `9` is odd and `5` is odd. (Condition met)\n\n    Since all conditions are met, we can apply the formula.\n\n6.  **Apply the formula:**\n    The number of self-intersection points `N` for a Lissajous curve `x = cos(nt)`, `y = sin(mt)` where `n` and `m` are odd coprime integers is given by:\n    `N = (n - 1)(m - 1) / 2`\n\n7.  **Calculate the final number:**\n    Substitute `n = 9` and `m = 5` into the formula:\n    `N = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2`\n    `N = (8)(4) / 2`\n    `N = 32 / 2`\n    `N = 16`\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Correct Formula:** It is crucial to use the correct formula for the specific type of Lissajous curve. The number of intersections can change with different trigonometric functions (e.g., `sin` vs `cos`) or with a different phase shift. For the `x = cos(nt), y = sin(mt)` case with `n, m` odd and coprime, the formula `(n-1)(m-1)/2` is standard.\n*   **Domain of `t`:** The intersections are counted over one full period of the curve, which is `[0, 2π)`. The start and end point `(t=0 and t=2π)` is the same but is not considered a self-intersection.\n*   **Interior vs. Boundary Intersections:** This formula counts \"interior\" self-intersections, where `|x| < 1` and `|y| < 1`. A detailed analysis (as sketched in the thought process) shows that for this specific curve, there are no self-intersections on the boundary (`|x|=1` or `|y|=1`). Therefore, the formula gives the total number of self-intersections.\n*   **Distinct Points:** The formula counts the number of distinct points in the plane where the curve crosses itself. It does not count the number of times the curve passes through these points.\n\nFinal calculation is straightforward once the correct formula is identified and its conditions are verified.\n\nFinal Answer is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
