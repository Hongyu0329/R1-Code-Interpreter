    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve in two parts.**\n\nThe curve is defined by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b \\sin t$. The parameter $b$ has a piecewise definition.\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b=1$.**\n    The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    This is the standard parametrization of a circle. Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    Since $t$ is in the interval $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin t \\ge 0$, which means $y \\ge 0$.\n    This part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of radius 1, centered at the origin (0,0).\n    *   The x-coordinates range from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n    *   The y-coordinates range from $\\sin(0)=0$ to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$. So, $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b=5$.**\n    The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n    We can write this as $x = \\cos t$ and $y/5 = \\sin t$. Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\n    Since $t$ is in the interval $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin t < 0$, which means $y < 0$.\n    This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\n    *   The x-coordinates range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$. So, $x \\in (-1, 1)$.\n    *   The y-coordinates are given by $y = 5\\sin t$. As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\sin t$ goes from $0$ to $-1$ and back to $0$. Thus, $y$ ranges from $0$ to $-5$ and back to $0$. So, $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the overall dimensions (bounding box) of the figure.**\n\nTo find the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of $x$ and $y$ for the entire curve.\n\n*   **X-dimension (Width):**\n    Combining both parts, the x-values span the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n    $x_{min} = -1$\n    $x_{max} = 1$\n    The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-dimension (Height):**\n    Combining both parts, the y-values from Part 1 are in $[0, 1]$ and from Part 2 are in $[-5, 0)$. The union of these ranges is $[-5, 1]$.\n    $y_{min} = -5$\n    $y_{max} = 1$\n    The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the side length of the smallest circumscribing square.**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that contains this figure must have a side length at least as large as the largest dimension of the figure.\n\nThe side length, $s$, of the smallest square must be equal to the maximum of the width and height.\n$s = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.**\n\nThe area of a square with side length $s$ is given by the formula $Area = s^2$.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n1.  **Piecewise Definition:** Correctly separate the curve based on the interval for $t$. (Done)\n2.  **Geometric Identification:** Identify the shapes for each piece (semi-circle and semi-ellipse). (Done)\n3.  **Extrema Calculation:** Find the maximum/minimum x and y values over the *entire* curve by combining the ranges from both pieces. (Done)\n4.  **Bounding Box Dimensions:** Calculate the total width and height from the extrema. (Done)\n5.  **Square Side Length:** The side length of the smallest circumscribing square is the *maximum* of the width and height. (Done)\n6.  **Final Area Calculation:** Remember to square the side length to get the area. (Done)\n\nThe final answer is the area of this square.\n\n<<<36>>>"
