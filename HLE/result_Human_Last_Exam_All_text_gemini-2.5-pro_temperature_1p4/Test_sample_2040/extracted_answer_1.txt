No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The primary reason is that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that can only occur in materials lacking a center of inversion (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, which dictates that their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)) is zero. Without a non-zero χ(2), SPDC cannot occur.
