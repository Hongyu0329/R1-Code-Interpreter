    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\n\n*   **What is it?** SPDC is a nonlinear optical quantum process. In this process, a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons).\n*   **What is the fundamental requirement for the material?** For SPDC to occur, the material must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as χ(2) (chi-two). This property describes how strongly the material's polarization responds nonlinearly to the square of an incident electric field.\n*   **What material property dictates a non-zero χ(2)?** The existence of a non-zero χ(2) is strictly governed by the crystal symmetry of the material. A material must be **non-centrosymmetric**, meaning it must lack a center of inversion symmetry. If a material has a center of inversion (is centrosymmetric), then χ(2) is identically zero, and second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC cannot occur in the bulk of the material.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Material - Free-standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)\n\n*   **What are they?** Boron nanosheets, commonly known as borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) single-atom-thick layers of boron atoms. They are analogous to graphene.\n*   **What is their crystal structure?** Unlike graphene which has one primary structure, borophene is polymorphic, meaning it can exist in several different stable or metastable structures (phases). The most commonly synthesized and theoretically studied phases for free-standing or near-free-standing borophene include the β12 and χ3 phases.\n*   **What is the symmetry of these structures?**\n    *   The **β12** phase of borophene has a triangular lattice with a space group of *P6/mmm*. This structure possesses a center of inversion.\n    *   The **χ3** phase of borophene has a rectangular lattice with a space group of *Pmmn*. This structure also possesses a center of inversion.\n    *   Other predicted stable phases of borophene are also typically centrosymmetric.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Analysis of the Phenomenon and the Material\n\n1.  **SPDC requires a non-zero χ(2).**\n2.  **A non-zero χ(2) requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.**\n3.  **The common, stable forms of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.**\n4.  **Therefore, the bulk χ(2) of free-standing boron nanosheets is zero.**\n\n### Step 4: Consider Potential Complications and Final Conclusion\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Edges, Defects, and Strain.** While an ideal, infinite boron nanosheet is centrosymmetric, real-world nanosheets have edges or defects which locally break this symmetry. Strain can also, in principle, break inversion symmetry. However, these effects would lead to a very weak, localized, and inefficient nonlinear response, not the strong, phase-matchable effect required for practical SPDC applications. The question asks about the intrinsic property of the nanosheets, which is governed by their ideal crystal structure.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Surface/Interface Effects.** For bulk crystals, even if the bulk is centrosymmetric (like silicon), the surface breaks the inversion symmetry, leading to a surface-specific χ(2). For a single atomic layer like borophene, the concepts of \"surface\" and \"bulk\" are intertwined. However, the in-plane symmetry of the 2D lattice is the dominant factor, and it is this symmetry that makes the bulk χ(2) zero.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Higher-Order Processes.** Centrosymmetric materials like borophene can exhibit third-order nonlinear effects (governed by χ(3)), such as four-wave mixing. However, the question specifically asks about SPDC, which is strictly a second-order (χ(2)) process.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the fundamental symmetry requirements for second-order nonlinear optical processes, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion because their crystal structures are centrosymmetric, resulting in a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)).\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The primary reason is that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that can only occur in materials lacking a center of inversion (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, which dictates that their second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)) is zero. Without a non-zero χ(2), SPDC cannot occur.>>>"
