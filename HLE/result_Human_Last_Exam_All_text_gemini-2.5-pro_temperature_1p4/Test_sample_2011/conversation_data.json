    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices. A clique of a certain size `k` is said to \"appear as an induced subgraph\" if there is a set of `k` vertices in the graph such that the subgraph induced by them is a complete graph `K_k`. This is the standard definition of a clique.\n\nLet `G` be a graph on 128 vertices. Let `C(G)` be the set of all integers `k` for which there exists a clique of size `k` in `G`. The problem is to find the maximum possible value of `|C(G)|` over all possible graphs `G` on 128 vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the Set of Clique Sizes in a Graph**\n\nLet `ω(G)` denote the clique number of the graph `G`, which is defined as the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between `ω(G)` and the set `C(G)`.\n1.  By definition of `ω(G)`, there exists at least one clique in `G` of size `ω(G)`. Let's call this clique `M`. The set of vertices of `M` is `V_M`, with `|V_M| = ω(G)`.\n2.  Consider any integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ ω(G)`. We can choose any subset of `k` vertices from `V_M`. Let's call this subset `S`.\n3.  Since `M` is a clique, every pair of distinct vertices in `V_M` is connected by an edge.\n4.  Since `S` is a subset of `V_M`, every pair of distinct vertices in `S` is also connected by an edge.\n5.  Therefore, `S` forms a clique of size `k`.\n6.  This implies that for every integer `k` from 1 to `ω(G)`, the graph `G` contains a clique of size `k`. In terms of our set notation, this means `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)} ⊆ C(G)`.\n\nFurthermore, by the definition of `ω(G)` as the size of the *largest* clique, there can be no clique of a size greater than `ω(G)`. This means that `C(G) ⊆ {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\nCombining these two points, we conclude that for any graph `G`, the set of all possible clique sizes is precisely `C(G) = {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\n**Step 3: Reframe the Problem**\n\nFrom Step 2, the number of different clique sizes in any graph `G` is `|C(G)| = |{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}| = ω(G)`.\n\nTherefore, the original problem \"determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\" is mathematically equivalent to the problem \"determine the maximum possible clique number `ω(G)` for a graph `G` on 128 vertices\".\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Reframed Problem**\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with `n = 128` vertices.\n\n1.  The clique number of any graph on `n` vertices cannot exceed `n`, because a clique of size `k` requires `k` distinct vertices. So, for any graph `G` on 128 vertices, `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n2.  We need to check if this upper bound can be achieved. Consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted `K_128`. In this graph, all 128 vertices are connected to each other.\n3.  The entire set of 128 vertices in `K_128` forms a clique. Therefore, the clique number of `K_{128}` is `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\nThis shows that the maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is indeed 128.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum number of different clique sizes is equal to the maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices, which is 128. This can be achieved by taking the complete graph `K_{128}`. This graph has cliques of every size from 1 to 128, for a total of 128 different sizes.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The phrasing \"induced subgraphs\" is not a special constraint; it aligns perfectly with the standard definition of a clique.\n*   The phrasing \"simultaneously appear\" simply means the cliques must all exist within the same single graph.\n*   One might be tempted to construct a graph by taking a disjoint union of cliques of different sizes (e.g., `K_1 ∪ K_2 ∪ ...`). This is a valid way to construct a graph, but it is not optimal for maximizing the number of clique sizes. As shown in the detailed thought process, such a construction would lead to a smaller number of total clique sizes compared to a single large clique. For example, `K_1 ∪ K_{127}` has 128 vertices, and its set of clique sizes is `{1, ..., 127}`, giving 127 different sizes, which is less than 128. The most efficient way to generate many clique sizes is to have one large clique, which contains smaller cliques as sub-cliques.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
