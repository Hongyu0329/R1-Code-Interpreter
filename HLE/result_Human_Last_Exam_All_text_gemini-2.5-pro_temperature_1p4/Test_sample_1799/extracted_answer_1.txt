No, it is not true. The 2nd postulate is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first. The first postulate by itself is ambiguous because it doesn't resolve the conflict between Galilean relativity (from mechanics) and Maxwell's equations (from electromagnetism). The second postulate is a necessary, independent statement that resolves this ambiguity by asserting that the properties of light predicted by Maxwell's equations are fundamental, which in turn forces a revision of the principles of mechanics.
