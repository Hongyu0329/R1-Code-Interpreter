    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key anatomical structures and the specific dinosaur species.**\nThe question is about the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. The specific anatomical feature is the \"lacrimal recess,\" and we need to count the number of \"depressions\" it contains. The lacrimal is a bone in the skull that is located in front of the eye socket. A recess is a hollow or indentation on a bone.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the primary scientific source describing this feature.**\nTo answer this question accurately, we must refer to the paleontological literature that describes the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The most detailed and foundational description of the holotype skull (SMNS 58022) is provided in the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the description of the lacrimal recess in the scientific paper.**\nIn this paper, the authors provide a detailed anatomical description of the skull bones. When describing the lacrimal bone, they specifically address the lacrimal recess.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The paper explicitly states that the lacrimal recess is not a single, uniform cavity. It is subdivided into smaller sections.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The text describes the subdivision: \"The lacrimal recess is subdivided by a low, vertically oriented ridge into **two large depressions**...\"\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The text then notes an additional feature: \"...**A small, slit-like depression** is present immediately dorsal to the larger, anterior depression.\"\n\n**Step 4: Tally the number of depressions based on the description.**\nBy carefully reading the description from the primary source, we can count the individual depressions:\n1.  One large anterior depression.\n2.  One large posterior depression (separated from the anterior one by a ridge).\n3.  One small, slit-like depression located above the anterior one.\n\nAdding these up (1 + 1 + 1), we get a total of three depressions.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBased on the definitive scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, the lacrimal recess contains a total of three distinct depressions.\n\n<<<3>>>"
