    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user wants to identify the specific verses (abyat/bayt) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi that list the names of the Prophets in Islam.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant section of the poem:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam is a creedal poem that systematically covers the essentials of Islamic belief. One of these essentials is the belief in the Prophets and Messengers (Anbiya' wal-Rusul). We need to locate the part of the poem dedicated to this topic.\n\n2.  **Locate the introductory verse:** The poem first introduces the topic and specifies the number of prophets that a Muslim is obligated to know by name. This is found in Bayt 27, which states:\n    > تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n    > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   **Translation:** The detailed account of twenty-five [prophets] is binding upon every responsible person, so verify and seize this [knowledge].\n    *   **Careful Point:** This verse *introduces* the list but does not contain any of the names itself. The question asks from which bayt the *names are mentioned*. Therefore, the list begins *after* this verse.\n\n3.  **Analyze the verses containing the names:** The verses immediately following Bayt 27 begin the enumeration of the 25 prophets.\n\n    *   **Bayt 28:** This is the first verse that contains the names of prophets.\n        > هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n        > صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        *   **Prophets mentioned (6):** Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, and Ibrahim.\n\n    *   **Bayt 29:** The list continues.\n        > لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا\n        > يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n        *   **Prophets mentioned (6):** Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n\n    *   **Bayt 30:** The list continues.\n        > شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ\n        > ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n        *   **Prophets mentioned (7):** Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n        *   **Careful Point:** It is important to count correctly; this verse contains seven names, not six.\n\n    *   **Bayt 31:** This is the final verse that contains names of the prophets.\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n        > عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        *   **Prophets mentioned (6):** Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is described as the \"Seal\" or `Khaatim`).\n\n4.  **Confirm the total and determine the range:**\n    *   The total number of prophets listed is 6 (Bayt 28) + 6 (Bayt 29) + 7 (Bayt 30) + 6 (Bayt 31) = 25. This matches the number stated in the introductory verse (Bayt 27).\n    *   The enumeration of the names begins in Bayt 28 and concludes in Bayt 31.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe names of the 25 prophets that are obligatory to be known in Islam are mentioned within a specific range of four verses in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam. The list starts at Bayt 28 and finishes at Bayt 31.\n\n<<<From Bayt 28 to Bayt 31>>>"
