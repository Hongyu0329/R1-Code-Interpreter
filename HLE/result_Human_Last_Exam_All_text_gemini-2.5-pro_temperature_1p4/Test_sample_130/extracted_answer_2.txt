The edges of any finite shapes or features will be smoothed out and will move based on their local curvature. Convex shapes will shrink and concave features will be filled in. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, this leads to the eventual disappearance of all such edges, as the image simplifies into a solid color (either all black or all white).
