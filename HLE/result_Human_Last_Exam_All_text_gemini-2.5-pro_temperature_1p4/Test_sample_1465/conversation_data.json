    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Careful Points & Core Concepts:**\n\n1.  **Coiled-Coil Structure:** Coiled-coils consist of alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids called a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`.\n2.  **Hydrophobic Core:** The stability and oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) are primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the `a` and `d` positions. These positions form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack together.\n3.  **Key Predictive Rules:** Based on extensive experimental studies (e.g., by Harbury, Alber, Kim, and Hodges), specific combinations of residues at the `a` and `d` positions are strong predictors of the oligomeric state.\n4.  **Heptad Register:** The \"register\" is the assignment of each amino acid in the sequence to one of the `a-g` positions. The optimal register can change between different sequences to maximize stabilizing interactions. We must deduce the most likely register for each sequence to identify its `a` and `d` residues.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n\n*   **Analysis:** The repeating unit is of the form `EIAxALK`. Let's test possible registers. A likely register is `f-g-a-b-c-d-e`, which places residues at key positions for stability.\n    *   Register: `f g a b c d e`\n    *   Sequence: `E I A Q A L K`\n    *   `a` position = `A` (Alanine)\n    *   `d` position = `L` (Leucine)\n*   **Conclusion:** The core is composed of `(A, L)` pairs. This combination is known to favor the formation of a **dimer**.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence is more complex, but the dominant repeating pattern appears to be `EIAALKQ`. Let's use the same `f-g-a-b-c-d-e` register as in Sequence 1.\n    *   Register: `f g a b c d e`\n    *   Sequence: `E I A A L K Q`\n    *   `a` position = `A` (Alanine)\n    *   `d` position = `L` (Leucine)\n*   **Conclusion:** The core is also composed of `(A, L)` pairs. Similar to the first sequence, this predicts the formation of a **dimer**.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n\n*   **Analysis:** The repeating unit is `EIAAIKx`. This sequence has a high content of Isoleucine (I) and Alanine (A). To determine the state, we must find a register that places key hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions. A different register, `b-a-b-c-d-e-f-g`, is most favorable here.\n    *   Register: `b a b c d e f g`\n    *   Sequence: `E I A A I K Q`\n    *   `a` position = `I` (Isoleucine)\n    *   `d` position = `I` (Isoleucine)\n*   **Conclusion:** The core is composed of `(I, I)` pairs. This packing of Isoleucine at both the `a` and `d` positions is the classic, strong signature of a **tetramer**.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 4**\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n\n*   **Analysis:** The repeating unit is `EIQxQLK`. Let's test the `f-g-a-b-c-d-e` register again.\n    *   Register: `f g a b c d e`\n    *   Sequence: `E I Q K Q L K`\n    *   `a` position = `Q` (Glutamine)\n    *   `d` position = `L` (Leucine)\n*   **Conclusion:** The core consists of `(Q, L)` pairs. Placing a polar residue like Glutamine (`Q`) in the hydrophobic `a` position creates a motif known as a \"Gln-zipper\". These are known to form stable **dimers**, where the glutamine side chains can form hydrogen bonds across the dimer interface.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n\n*   **Analysis:** The repeating unit is `EIAxTLK`. This sequence is very similar to Sequence 1, with an Alanine (`A`) replaced by a Threonine (`T`). Let's test the `g-a-b-c-d-e-f` register, which is known to be correct for this specific, well-studied sequence.\n    *   Register: `g a b c d e f`\n    *   Sequence: `E I A Q T L K`\n    *   `a` position = `I` (Isoleucine)\n    *   `d` position = `T` (Threonine)\n*   **Conclusion:** The core is composed of `(I, T)` pairs. Placing a polar residue like Threonine (`T`) in the `d` position of the hydrophobic core generally favors a **trimer**. In a trimeric structure, the three polar hydroxyl groups of the threonines can point towards the center of the bundle and form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network.\n*   **Oligomeric State: 3**\n\n---\n**Final Answer Synthesis**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the predicted oligomeric states for the five sequences are:\n1.  Dimer (2)\n2.  Dimer (2)\n3.  Tetramer (4)\n4.  Dimer (2)\n5.  Trimer (3)\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of numbers: **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
