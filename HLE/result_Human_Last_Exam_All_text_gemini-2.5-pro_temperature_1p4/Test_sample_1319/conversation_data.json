    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks for the tallest *historical* mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, excluding Mount Olympus. This requires three key pieces of information:\n1.  A list of all mountains mentioned by name in the *Iliad*.\n2.  Confirmation that these are historical (real) mountains.\n3.  Their respective elevations to determine the ranking.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad*\nWe need to comb through the text of the *Iliad* to find references to specific mountains. The most prominent ones are:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned frequently. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This name refers to a mountain near Troy from which Zeus and other gods often observe the battle. It is a central geographical feature in the epic. (Note: There is another Mount Ida on Crete, associated with Zeus's birth, but the one relevant to the Trojan War is in modern-day Turkey).\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, the god Poseidon watches the Trojan War from the \"topmost peak of wooded Samothrace.\"\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, the goddess Hera, traveling from Olympus to Lemnos, flies over the peak of Mount Athos.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned in connection with Achilles' famous spear, which was cut from an ash tree on its peak.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" (Book 2) as the home of the Maeonians, described as being \"under snowy Tmolus.\"\n\n### Step 3: Find the Elevations of These Historical Mountains\nNow we need to find the modern elevation for each of these real-world mountains to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus (for reference):** The highest peak, Mytikas, is **2,918 meters (9,573 ft)**. This is the one we must exclude from the final ranking.\n*   **Mount Ida (near Troy, modern Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** The highest peak is **1,774 meters (5,820 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (peak is Fengari, Greece):** The highest peak is **1,611 meters (5,285 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Athos (Greece):** The highest peak is **2,033 meters (6,670 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** The highest peak is **1,624 meters (5,328 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Tmolus (modern Bozdağlar range, Turkey):** The highest peak is **2,159 meters (7,083 ft)**.\n\n### Step 4: Compare Elevations and Determine the Tallest After Olympus\nLet's list the mountains in descending order of elevation:\n\n1.  Mount Olympus: 2,918 m (Excluded)\n2.  **Mount Tmolus: 2,159 m**\n3.  Mount Athos: 2,033 m\n4.  Mount Ida: 1,774 m\n5.  Mount Pelion: 1,624 m\n6.  Mount Samothrace: 1,611 m\n\nAfter excluding Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Specificity of the Text:** It is crucial to only consider mountains explicitly named in the *Iliad*. While other famous Greek mountains exist (like Parnassus or Cithaeron), they are central to other myths and not mentioned in the *Iliad*.\n*   **Historical vs. Mythological:** All the mountains listed are real, geographical locations that can be identified today.\n*   **Identification:** Correctly identifying the ancient names with their modern counterparts (e.g., Mount Ida of the *Iliad* is Kaz Dağı, not the Ida on Crete; Mount Tmolus is the Bozdağlar range).\n*   **Accuracy of Elevation:** Using standardized, modern elevation data is key to making a correct comparison.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, we can confidently identify the answer.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
