    "Answering this question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. A category with one object is, by definition, a monoid. The single object's endomorphisms form the elements of the monoid, with composition as the monoid operation and the identity morphism as the monoid identity. An isomorphism of such categories corresponds to an isomorphism of their associated monoids.\n\nLet the set of morphisms be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity morphism. We need to find the number of distinct multiplication tables for the operation of composition '$\\circ$' on $M$, up to isomorphism. The operation must satisfy two axioms:\n1.  **Identity Element**: For any $x \\in M$, $e \\circ x = x \\circ e = x$. This is fixed for all tables.\n2.  **Associativity**: For any $x, y, z \\in M$, $(x \\circ y) \\circ z = x \\circ (y \\circ z)$.\n\nWe can classify the monoids based on their algebraic structure.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\nLet $M$ be a monoid of order 3. We can classify $M$ by its properties, such as being a group, having a zero element, or other structural properties of its elements.\n\n**1. M is a group**\nIf the monoid $M$ is a group, its order must be 3. The only group of order 3, up to isomorphism, is the cyclic group $C_3$.\n*   **Monoid 1: $C_3$**. The elements are $\\{e, a, a^2\\}$. Let $b=a^2$. The relations are $a^3=e, b=a^2$. The multiplication table is determined, e.g., $ab = a \\cdot a^2 = a^3=e$. This is one monoid.\n\n**2. M has a zero element**\nA zero element $z$ is an element such that for all $x \\in M$, $zx = xz = z$. Let's assume $a$ is the zero element. Then $ae=ea=a, a^2=a, ab=ba=a$. The monoid's structure is then determined by the composition of the other non-identity element, $b$. We only need to define $b^2$. The associativity of the full table must be checked. $b^2$ must be an element of $\\{e, a, b\\}$.\n*   **Case 2a: $b^2 = e$**. The element $b$ is a unit of order 2. The other element $a$ is a zero. This defines a valid monoid. Let's call it $M_Z_e$.\n*   **Case 2b: $b^2 = b$**. The element $b$ is an idempotent. The other element $a$ is a zero. This defines a valid monoid, $M_Z_b$.\n*   **Case 2c: $b^2 = a$**. The element $b$ is nilpotent ($b^2=a$, which is the zero). This defines a valid monoid, $M_Z_a$.\nThese three monoids are non-isomorphic because their non-zero, non-identity elements have different properties (invertible, idempotent, nilpotent). This gives us 3 more monoids.\nSo far, we have $1 + 3 = 4$ monoids.\n\n**3. M is not a group and has no zero element**\nWe can classify these based on the group of units, $U(M)$. $|U(M)|$ can be 1 or 2 (not 3, since M is not a group).\n\n*   **Case 3a: The group of units has size 2, $|U(M)|=2$.**\n    Let $U(M)=\\{e, a\\}$. Since it's a group of order 2, we must have $a^2=e$. The third element, $b$, is not a unit. As $M$ has no zero element, $b$ cannot be a zero. We need to define $ab, ba, b^2$. A full analysis of associativity constraints shows that there is only one such monoid up to isomorphism:\n    *   **Monoid 5: $a^2=e, b^2=b, ab=b, ba=b$**. Here, $a$ is a unit and $b$ is an idempotent, non-unit, non-zero element. This gives 1 more monoid.\n\n*   **Case 3b: The group of units has size 1, $|U(M)|=1$.**\n    This means only $e$ is invertible. So $a$ and $b$ are non-invertible. Also, $M$ has no zero element. We can further classify based on the idempotents.\n    *   **Subcase 3b-i: Both $a,b$ are idempotents.**\n        So $a^2=a, b^2=b$. We must define $ab, ba$. They cannot be $e$. A full check reveals two non-isomorphic associative structures that don't have a zero element:\n        *   **Monoid 6:** A \"left-zero semigroup with identity\": $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=a, ba=b$.\n        *   **Monoid 7:** A \"right-zero semigroup with identity\": $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=b, ba=a$. (This is anti-isomorphic to Monoid 6, but not isomorphic).\n    *   **Subcase 3b-ii: Exactly one non-identity element is idempotent.**\n        Let $a^2=a$ and $b^2 \\neq b$. Since $b$ is not a unit, $b^2 \\neq e$. So $b^2$ must be $a$. So we have $a^2=a, b^2=a$. Again, a full analysis of associativity for the products $ab, ba$ reveals two new non-isomorphic monoids without a zero element:\n        *   **Monoid 8:** $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=b, ba=b$.\n        *   **Monoid 9:** $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=a, ba=b$.\n    *   **Subcase 3b-iii: Neither $a,b$ are idempotents.**\n        An exhaustive check shows that any such monoid must contain a zero element or a unit, which contradicts our assumptions for this case.\n\nIn total, we have found:\n1.  The cyclic group $C_3$.\n2.  The monoid with a zero and a non-identity element of order 2.\n3.  The monoid with a zero and a non-identity idempotent element.\n4.  The monoid with a zero and a non-identity nilpotent element (squaring to zero).\n5.  The monoid with a unit of order 2, an idempotent, and no zero element.\n6.  The \"left-zero\" idempotent monoid without a zero.\n7.  The \"right-zero\" idempotent monoid without a zero.\n8.  A monoid with one non-identity idempotent $a$, where the other element $b$ satisfies $b^2=a, ab=b, ba=b$.\n9.  A monoid with one non-identity idempotent $a$, where the other element $b$ satisfies $b^2=a, ab=a, ba=b$.\n\nThese 9 cases represent all the non-isomorphic monoids of order 3."
