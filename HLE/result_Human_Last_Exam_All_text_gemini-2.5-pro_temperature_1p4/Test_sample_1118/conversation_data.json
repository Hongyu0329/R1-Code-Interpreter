    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA, the Nazi paramilitary force who arrested him in early 1933).\n*   **Question:** What object does he hold in his hand as a symbol of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific painting.**\nThe self-portrait in question is one of Querner's most famous works. It is titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Distel,\" which translates to \"Self-Portrait with Thistle.\" This immediately gives us a strong clue about the object he is holding.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the object and its symbolic meaning.**\nThe object Querner holds in his hand is a **thistle**.\n\n**Careful Points regarding the symbolism:**\n\n*   **Resilience and Defiance:** A thistle is a plant known for its prickly, tough, and resilient nature. It can grow in harsh conditions and is difficult to eradicate. This mirrors Querner's own situation as an artist and political dissident who had just escaped imprisonment and was living as a fugitive from the Nazi regime. The plant symbolizes his own stubborn will to survive and resist oppression.\n*   **Rejection of Idealization:** The choice of a common, thorny \"weed\" over a conventionally beautiful flower is a deliberate artistic statement. It aligns with the principles of the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement, which favored unsentimental, raw depictions of reality. This stood in stark contrast to the idealized, heroic art promoted by the Nazis. By holding up a thistle, he presents an unvarnished, defiant truth.\n*   **The Artist's Pose:** In the portrait, Querner looks over his shoulder with a wary, intense expression, as if he is still being hunted. He presents the thistle to the viewer almost as a challenge or a statement of his unyielding identity. The combination of his gaze and the symbolic object creates a powerful portrait of resistance.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the findings to form a final answer.**\nCurt Querner's 1933 painting, \"Self-Portrait with Thistle,\" was created after he escaped from Nazi custody. In the portrait, he holds a thistle. This plant serves as a potent symbol of his resistance, representing his resilience, defiance, and refusal to be broken by the oppressive regime, much like the hardy, prickly plant itself.\n\n<<<A thistle>>>"
