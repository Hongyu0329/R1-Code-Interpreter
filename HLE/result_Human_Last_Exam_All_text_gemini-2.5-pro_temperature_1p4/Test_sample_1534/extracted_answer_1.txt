The two primary brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the main body of the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the **Posterior Fin Lobes** and the **Giant Fiber Lobe**. The Posterior Fin Lobes are a distinct pair of lobes controlling the lateral fins, while the Giant Fiber Lobe is the specialized posterior-most subdivision of the palliovisceral lobe complex that initiates the escape-jet response.
