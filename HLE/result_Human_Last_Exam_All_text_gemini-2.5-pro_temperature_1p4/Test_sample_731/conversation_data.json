    "This problem asks for the number of \"power subgroups\" in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the terminology and the group.**\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup H of a group G is a power subgroup if it can be generated by a single element of G. In other words, a power subgroup is simply a cyclic subgroup. So, the question is asking for the number of cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    For this problem, the size is 512, so $2^n = 512$, which means $n = 9$.\n    The group is $SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$.\n    The presentation is $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The group has a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256. The elements of the group are either of the form $r^j$ (256 elements) or $sr^j$ (256 elements).\n\n**Step 2: Strategy to count cyclic subgroups.**\n\nWe can find all cyclic subgroups by considering the subgroups generated by each element. A systematic way is to partition the subgroups into two categories:\n1.  Cyclic subgroups that are entirely contained within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n2.  Cyclic subgroups that are not contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$. These must be generated by elements of the form $sr^j$.\n\n**Step 3: Count cyclic subgroups contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$.**\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256. A cyclic group of order $m$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$. We need to find the number of divisors of 256.\nSince $256 = 2^8$, its divisors are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^8$.\nThere are $8+1=9$ divisors.\nTherefore, there are **9** cyclic subgroups contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$. These are the subgroups of orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze and count cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^j$.**\n\nLet $g = sr^j$. We first need to find the order of this element.\nWe use the relation $srs = r^k$ where $k = 2^{n-2}-1 = 127$. This implies $sr = r^k s$.\nWe can show that $sr^j s = r^{kj}$.\nNow, let's calculate $g^2$:\n$g^2 = (sr^j)^2 = sr^j s r^j = (sr^j s)r^j = r^{kj}r^j = r^{j(k+1)}$.\nFor $n=9$, $k+1 = (2^{9-2}-1)+1 = 2^7 = 128$.\nSo, $(sr^j)^2 = r^{128j}$.\n\nTo find the order of $g = sr^j$, we analyze the order of $g^2 = r^{128j}$.\nThe order of $r^{128j}$ in $\\langle r \\rangle$ (which has order 256) is $\\frac{256}{\\gcd(128j, 256)} = \\frac{256}{128 \\cdot \\gcd(j, 2)} = \\frac{2}{\\gcd(j, 2)}$.\n\n*   **Case A: $j$ is even.**\n    If $j$ is even, $\\gcd(j, 2) = 2$. The order of $r^{128j}$ is $2/2 = 1$. So, $(sr^j)^2 = 1$.\n    Since $sr^j \\neq 1$, the order of $sr^j$ is 2.\n    There are $256/2 = 128$ even values for $j$ in the range $\\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$. Each of these 128 elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n    These subgroups are of the form $\\{1, sr^j\\}$. Since the non-identity element $sr^j$ is not in $\\langle r \\rangle$, these subgroups are distinct from the subgroup of order 2 found in Step 3 ($\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$).\n    So, we have **128** new cyclic subgroups of order 2.\n\n*   **Case B: $j$ is odd.**\n    If $j$ is odd, $\\gcd(j, 2) = 1$. The order of $r^{128j}$ is $2/1 = 2$.\n    So, $(sr^j)^2 = r^{128j} = r^{128}$ (since $j$ is odd). This is not the identity.\n    Let's find $(sr^j)^4$:\n    $(sr^j)^4 = ((sr^j)^2)^2 = (r^{128})^2 = r^{256} = 1$.\n    Since $(sr^j)^2 \\neq 1$ but $(sr^j)^4 = 1$, the order of $sr^j$ is 4.\n    There are $256/2 = 128$ odd values for $j$ in $\\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$. Each of these 128 elements has order 4.\n    A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4)=2$ generators. Let's find the generators of $H_j = \\langle sr^j \\rangle$.\n    $H_j = \\{1, sr^j, (sr^j)^2, (sr^j)^3\\} = \\{1, sr^j, r^{128}, sr^{j+128}\\}$.\n    The elements of order 4 in $H_j$ are $sr^j$ and $sr^{j+128}$ (since $j$ odd implies $j+128$ is odd).\n    So, $\\langle sr^j \\rangle = \\langle sr^{j+128} \\rangle$.\n    The 128 elements of order 4 are paired up, with each pair generating the same subgroup.\n    The number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 is therefore $128 / 2 = 64$.\n    These **64** subgroups are distinct from the subgroup of order 4 in $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of cyclic subgroups.**\n\nWe sum the number of subgroups from each category:\n*   Cyclic subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$: 9\n*   Cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by elements $sr^j$: 128\n*   Cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by elements $sr^j$: 64\n\nTotal number of cyclic subgroups = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$."
