To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its physical shape in response to sunlight. When the sun rises, the table should transform from a relatively straight, elongated shape (representing the stable *trans*-azobenzene isomer) into a bent or V-shape (representing the *cis*-azobenzene isomer) upon absorbing UV light. When the sun sets and it gets dark, the table must gradually return from its bent shape back to the elongated shape, mimicking the thermal relaxation of the molecule to its more stable form.
