    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the name of a *fictional singer* represented by a *cardboard cutout* in a specific episode of an online cartoon.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Key Information:**\n    *   **Cartoon Series:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n    *   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n    *   **Event:** Junior prom\n    *   **Performer:** A cardboard cutout\n    *   **Identity Needed:** The name of the fictional singer.\n\n3.  **Recall/Research the Episode Plot:**\n    *   \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" focuses on the four main girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their Junior prom.\n    *   A significant scene at the prom involves the musical entertainment.\n\n4.  **Examine the \"Performance\" Scene:**\n    *   Instead of a live band, the musical performance at the prom is provided by a boombox playing music on a stage.\n    *   Next to the boombox is a life-sized cardboard cutout of a male singer.\n    *   A character exclaims, \"Look! It's a cardboard cutout of that guy from that band!\"\n\n5.  **Identify the Name:**\n    *   To identify the singer, we need to look at the details provided in the scene.\n    *   The boombox has a cassette tape visible in its deck.\n    *   A close-up shot clearly shows the label on the cassette tape.\n    *   The label reads: **Kaiser - \"Shining\"**.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The text on the cassette tape explicitly names the artist as \"Kaiser\" and the song as \"Shining\".\n    *   Since the cardboard cutout is the visual representation of the musical artist, the name of the fictional singer is Kaiser.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The question specifically asks for a *fictional* singer. The artist \"Kaiser\" exists only within the Homestar Runner universe for this gag. It should not be confused with the real-world band Kaiser Chiefs.\n*   **Cardboard Cutout:** The detail that the performer is a cardboard cutout is crucial. It's the central joke of the scene and confirms it's not a \"live\" character performance.\n*   **Source of the Name:** The name is not spoken aloud in full; it is revealed visually on the cassette tape in the boombox.\n*   **Singer vs. Band:** The dialogue mentions \"that guy from that band,\" which could imply the band's name is Kaiser. However, in pop music, it's common for a solo artist's name to also be treated as the name of their act (e.g., \"Prince,\" \"Beck\"). Since the cutout is of a single person and the tape is labeled \"Kaiser,\" this is the most direct and accurate answer for the name of the fictional performer.\n\nBy following these steps and paying attention to the careful points, we can confidently identify the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Kaiser>>>"
