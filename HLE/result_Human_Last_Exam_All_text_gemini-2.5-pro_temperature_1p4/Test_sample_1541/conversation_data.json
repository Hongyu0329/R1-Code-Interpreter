    "Answering this competitive programming problem requires careful analysis, especially with the constraint of creating the \"most memory-efficient C program\". Here is a step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Objective:** The core task is to sort the numbers in a given mathematical sum.\n2.  **Input:** A string representing a sum, like \"3+1+4+2+2\".\n    *   The string contains only digits '1', '2', '3', '4' and the '+' character.\n    *   It is a valid sum, meaning digits and '+' alternate correctly.\n    *   The maximum length of the string is 1000 characters.\n3.  **Output:** A string with the same numbers and '+' signs, but with the numbers sorted in non-decreasing (ascending) order, like \"1+2+2+3+4\".\n4.  **Constraint:** The C program must be as memory-efficient as possible. The final answer `m` should be the total memory in bytes used by the variables declared in the solution.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Memory Optimization:** The primary constraint is memory usage. A naive approach might be to read the entire string into a character array (e.g., `char s[1001];`), extract the numbers into an integer array (e.g., `int nums[501];`), sort the integer array, and then print the result. This would use over 1000 bytes for the string and over 2000 bytes for the integer array, which is not optimal.\n2.  **Nature of Data:** The numbers to be sorted are very limited: only 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is a classic indicator that a specialized sorting algorithm, **Counting Sort**, is the ideal choice. Instead of storing all the numbers, we only need to store the *count* of each number.\n3.  **Input Handling:** To avoid storing the entire 1000-character input string in memory, we can process the input one character at a time using a function like `getchar()`.\n4.  **Data Type Selection:** To minimize memory, we must choose the smallest standard C data type that can safely hold the required values for each variable.\n    *   The maximum number of terms in the sum is `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 500.5`, meaning at most 501 numbers. The count for any single digit (e.g., the count of '1's) cannot exceed 501.\n    *   An `unsigned char` (range 0-255) is too small for the counts.\n    *   A `short` (guaranteed range of at least ±32,767, typically 2 bytes) is sufficient and more memory-efficient than an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n5.  **Output Handling:** To generate the sorted sum, we can iterate from 1 to 4 and print each number according to its stored count. We need a simple mechanism, like a flag, to handle the placement of '+' signs only between numbers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, here is the design for the most memory-efficient C program and the calculation of its memory usage.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Declare an array `counts` of size 5 to store the frequencies of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (index 0 will be unused).\n2.  Read the input one character at a time in a loop until the end of the line.\n3.  If the character is a digit ('1' through '4'), increment the corresponding counter in the `counts` array. Ignore '+' characters.\n4.  After counting, construct the output. Use a flag variable, `is_first_term`, to ensure a '+' is not printed before the very first number.\n5.  Print all the '1's, followed by all the '2's, and so on, up to '4'. For each number printed after the first one, prepend it with a '+' sign.\n\n**Calculation of Variable Memory (`m`):**\n\nWe identify the variables needed in the `main` function and choose the most memory-efficient data types.\n\n1.  **Counters Array (`counts`):**\n    *   Purpose: To store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   Data Type: `short`. As explained, a `short` (2 bytes) is the smallest standard type that can hold a count up to 501.\n    *   Memory Usage: `5 * sizeof(short) = 5 * 2 = 10` bytes.\n\n2.  **Input Character (`c`):**\n    *   Purpose: To temporarily store each character read from the input stream.\n    *   Data Type: `char` (1 byte).\n    *   Memory Usage: `1 * sizeof(char) = 1 * 1 = 1` byte.\n\n3.  **Output Separator Flag (`is_first_term`):**\n    *   Purpose: A boolean flag (0 or 1) to track whether to print a '+' before a number.\n    *   Data Type: `char` (1 byte) is the smallest addressable memory unit and can be used to store this flag.\n    *   Memory Usage: `1 * sizeof(char) = 1 * 1 = 1` byte.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation:**\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\n\n`m = (memory for counts) + (memory for c) + (memory for is_first_term)`\n`m = 10 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte`\n`m = 12 bytes`\n\nThis approach avoids large buffers and unnecessary variables, making it extremely memory-efficient.\n\n<<<12>>>"
