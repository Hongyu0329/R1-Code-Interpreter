    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify two specific individuals who meet the following criteria:\n    *   They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n    *   The commercial was from the year 2000 (or thereabouts).\n    *   The commercial was part of a campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n    *   The commercial is described as \"infamous\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Infamous\" Nature:** The reason the commercial is \"infamous\" is due to the immense irony. Enron, a company on the verge of collapsing due to one of the largest accounting frauds in history, ran a high-minded, intellectual advertising campaign urging the public to question assumptions and \"Ask Why.\" The campaign was designed to portray Enron as an innovative, transparent, and forward-thinking company, the exact opposite of what it was revealed to be.\n\n3.  **Identify the \"Ask Why\" Campaign:** In 2000, Enron launched a multi-million dollar television and print advertising campaign created by the agency Ogilvy & Mather. The campaign's theme and tagline was \"Ask Why,\" featuring various intellectual and artistic figures posing questions about the modern world and economy.\n\n4.  **Identify the Featured Individuals:** Research into this specific ad campaign reveals that several commercials were produced. One of the most-cited commercials featured two prominent economists discussing markets and ideas against a stark, minimalist background. These two economists were Merton Miller and Paul Krugman.\n\n5.  **Verify Nobel Laureate Status (A Careful Point):** This is the most crucial verification step and requires careful attention to dates.\n    *   **Merton Miller:** He was a co-recipient of the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his pioneering work in the theory of financial economics. At the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was unequivocally a Nobel laureate. (Sadly, he passed away in June 2000, the same year the campaign ran).\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his work on international trade theory. Therefore, at the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was a very prominent and respected economist at MIT, but he was **not yet** a Nobel laureate.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Answer:** Despite the fact that Paul Krugman won his Nobel prize eight years after the commercial aired, historical accounts and discussions of this \"infamous\" commercial almost always refer to them as \"two Nobel laureates\" in retrospect. Krugman himself has commented on the unfortunate irony of his participation. Given the common phrasing and understanding of this trivia, Miller and Krugman are the two intended individuals. The question identifies them by their eventual status as Nobel laureates.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two individuals featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial who are known as Nobel laureates are Merton Miller, who had already won the prize in 1990, and Paul Krugman, who would go on to win the prize in 2008.\n\n<<<Merton Miller and Paul Krugman>>>"
