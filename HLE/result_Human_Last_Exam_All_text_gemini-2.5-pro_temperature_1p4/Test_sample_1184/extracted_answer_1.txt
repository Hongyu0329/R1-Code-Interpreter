**1. Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit (in human Cavβ1):**
The primary interaction hotspots are hydrophobic and polar residues that form the AID-Binding Pocket (ABP) in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain. The most critical residues are:
*   **Y371 (Tyrosine)**
*   **V405 (Valine)**
*   **A409 (Alanine)**
*   **V413 (Valine)**
*   **M430 (Methionine)**
*   **I457 (Isoleucine)**
*   **W461 (Tryptophan)**

**2. Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of alpha-1 subunit (in human Cavβ1):**
Gating modulation is controlled by several regions outside the primary binding pocket. Key hotspots are located in:
*   **N-Terminal Domain (Residues ~1-205):** The entire variable sequence of this domain acts as a modular hotspot that dictates the kinetics of channel inactivation.
*   **SH3 Domain:** Residues on the canonical peptide-binding surface that modulate inactivation kinetics.
    *   **W271 (Tryptophan)**
    *   **Y273 (Tyrosine)**
*   **HOOK Region of GK Domain:** A cluster of charged residues crucial for modulating the voltage-dependence of activation.
    *   **R480 (Arginine)**
    *   **K483 (Lysine)**
    *   **R484 (Arginine)**
