    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\nAn 8x8 chessboard has four edges:\n*   The first rank (row 1)\n*   The last rank (row 8)\n*   The first file (file 'a')\n*   The last file (file 'h')\n\nThe total number of edge squares can be calculated by adding the squares on each side and subtracting the corners that are counted twice:\n(8 squares on rank 1) + (8 squares on rank 8) + (8 squares on file 'a') + (8 squares on file 'h') - 4 corner squares = 32 - 4 = 28.\nSo, there are **28 edge squares** in total.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Constraints of Placing Bishops**\nThe main rule of the game is that no bishop can attack another. A bishop attacks any square along the two diagonals it occupies. This means two bishops cannot be placed on the same diagonal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a Strategy to Maximize the Number of Bishops**\nTo find out how many squares lack bishops, we first need to find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares without any attacking each other.\n\n1.  A good starting point is to place bishops along a single edge, as none of them can attack each other. Let's place 8 bishops on all the squares of the first rank (from a1 to h1).\n\n2.  Now, let's try to add more bishops on the opposite edge, rank 8. We need to check which squares on rank 8 are attacked by the bishops we already placed on rank 1.\n    *   A bishop on a1 attacks along the a1-h8 diagonal. Thus, we cannot place a bishop on h8.\n    *   A bishop on h1 attacks along the h1-a8 diagonal. Thus, we cannot place a bishop on a8.\n    *   None of the other bishops on rank 1 (b1 through g1) can attack any square on rank 8.\n\n3.  This means that out of the 8 squares on rank 8, two (a8 and h8) are attacked. The remaining 6 squares (b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8) are safe. We can place a bishop on each of these 6 squares. These 6 bishops do not attack each other since they are all on the same rank.\n\n4.  So far, we have placed 8 bishops on rank 1 and 6 bishops on rank 8, for a total of **14 bishops**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify That No More Bishops Can Be Added**\nNow we must check if we can add any more bishops to the remaining edge squares, which are the non-corner squares on files 'a' and 'h'.\n\n*   **File 'a' (squares a2 to a7):**\n    *   a2 is attacked by the bishop on b1.\n    *   a3 is attacked by the bishop on c1.\n    *   a4 is attacked by the bishop on d1.\n    *   a5 is attacked by the bishop on e1.\n    *   a6 is attacked by the bishop on f1.\n    *   a7 is attacked by the bishop on g1.\n    Every square from a2 to a7 is attacked by a bishop on rank 1.\n\n*   **File 'h' (squares h2 to h7):**\n    *   h2 is attacked by the bishop on g1.\n    *   h3 is attacked by the bishop on f1.\n    *   h4 is attacked by the bishop on e1.\n    *   h5 is attacked by the bishop on d1.\n    *   h6 is attacked by the bishop on c1.\n    *   h7 is attacked by the bishop on b1.\n    Every square from h2 to h7 is also attacked by a bishop on rank 1.\n\nSince all other available edge squares are under attack, we cannot place any more bishops. The maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is **14**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n\n*   Total number of edge squares: 28\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed: 14\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total squares - Placed bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14\n\nThus, if they succeeded in placing the maximum number of bishops, 14 edge squares would lack bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
