    "An analysis of the user's question is as follows. The user wants to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two given 2x2 polynomial matrices, $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of GCRD**\nA polynomial matrix $R(s)$ is a right divisor of a polynomial matrix $P(s)$ if there exists a polynomial matrix $Q(s)$ such that $P(s) = Q(s)R(s)$.\nA polynomial matrix $R(s)$ is a greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$ if:\n1.  $R(s)$ is a common right divisor of both $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$.\n2.  Any other common right divisor $D(s)$ of $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$ is also a right divisor of $R(s)$. That is, $R(s) = L(s)D(s)$ for some polynomial matrix $L(s)$.\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method to find the GCRD**\nThe standard method to find the GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves forming a stacked matrix by placing one matrix on top of the other and then reducing it to a specific form using elementary row operations.\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nWe form the stacked matrix $M(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{pmatrix}$ and perform elementary row operations to reduce it to the form $\\begin{pmatrix} R(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $R(s)$ is a square matrix in row-echelon form. The resulting matrix $R(s)$ is a GCRD of $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the method step-by-step**\n\nThe given matrices are:\n$P_1(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_2(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nForm the stacked matrix:\n$M(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nLet the rows be R1, R2, R3, R4. It is computationally easier to work with rows of lower polynomial degree first. So, we'll rearrange the matrix by swapping rows to bring the rows of $P_2$ to the top.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} s & 0 & (R3) \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 & (R4) \\\\ s^2+s & -s & (R1) \\\\ -s^2-1 & s^2 & (R2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we perform row reduction. Let's use the row with the simplest leading polynomial as the pivot. The row $(s,0)$ is a good starting pivot. Let's call the rows of the reordered matrix r1, r2, r3, r4.\n$r1 = (s, 0)$\n$r2 = (-s-1, 1)$\n$r3 = (s^2+s, -s)$\n$r4 = (-s^2-1, s^2)$\n\nReduce r2 using r1: The leading element of r2 is $-s-1$. Divide by the leading element of r1, which is $s$. The quotient is $-1$, and the remainder is $-1$.\nSo, we perform the operation $r2 \\to r2 - (-1)r1 = r2 + r1$.\n$(-s-1, 1) + (s, 0) = (-1, 1)$. The new r2 is $(-1, 1)$.\n\nReduce r3 using r1: The leading element of r3 is $s^2+s$. Divide by $s$. The quotient is $s+1$.\nSo, we perform $r3 \\to r3 - (s+1)r1$.\n$(s^2+s, -s) - (s+1)(s,0) = (s^2+s - (s^2+s), -s) = (0, -s)$. The new r3 is $(0, -s)$.\n\nReduce r4 using r1: The leading element of r4 is $-s^2-1$. Divide by $s$. The quotient is $-s$, and the remainder is $-1$.\nSo, we perform $r4 \\to r4 - (-s)r1 = r4+sr1$.\n$(-s^2-1, s^2) + s(s,0) = (-s^2-1+s^2, s^2) = (-1, s^2)$. The new r4 is $(-1, s^2)$.\n\nThe matrix is now:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -s \\\\ -1 & s^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe new lowest-degree non-zero leading element is in the row $(-1, 1)$. Let's use this row as the pivot. Let's call the current rows R1', R2', R3', R4'.\n$R1' = (s,0)$\n$R2' = (-1,1)$\n$R3' = (0, -s)$\n$R4' = (-1, s^2)$\n\nReduce R1' using R2': The leading element of R1' is $s$. Divide by the leading element of R2', which is $-1$. The quotient is $-s$.\nPerform $R1' \\to R1' - (-s)R2' = R1' + sR2'$.\n$(s,0) + s(-1, 1) = (s-s, s) = (0, s)$.\n\nReduce R4' using R2': The leading element of R4' is $-1$. Divide by $-1$. The quotient is $1$.\nPerform $R4' \\to R4' - (1)R2'$.\n$(-1, s^2) - (-1, 1) = (-1+1, s^2-1) = (0, s^2-1)$.\nR3' already has a zero as its first element, so no operation is needed.\n\nThe matrix is now:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & s \\\\ -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -s \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nLet's reorder to group the rows with leading zeros and pivot on the first column element where it's non-zero.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s \\\\ 0 & -s \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we work on the submatrix $\\begin{pmatrix} s \\\\ -s \\\\ s^2-1 \\end{pmatrix}$. We pivot on $s$. Let the rows be R''1, R''2, R''3, R''4.\nReduce R''3 using R''2: Leading element is $-s$. Divide by leading element of R''2, which is $s$. Quotient is $-1$.\nPerform $R''3 \\to R''3 - (-1)R''2 = R''3+R''2$.\n$(0, -s) + (0, s) = (0, 0)$.\n\nReduce R''4 using R''2: Leading element is $s^2-1$. Divide by $s$. Quotient is $s$, remainder is $-1$.\nPerform $R''4 \\to R''4 - s R''2$.\n$(0, s^2-1) - s(0, s) = (0, s^2-1-s^2) = (0, -1)$.\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe now have the non-zero rows $(-1,1), (0,s), (0,-1)$. Let's use $(0,-1)$ as the pivot for the second column. Let's reorder for clarity.\n$\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & s \\end{pmatrix}$ (ignoring the zero row).\n\nLet the rows be r_a, r_b, r_c.\nReduce r_a using r_b: The second element of r_a is 1. Divide by second element of r_b, which is $-1$. Quotient is $-1$.\nPerform $r_a \\to r_a - (-1)r_b = r_a + r_b$.\n$(-1, 1) + (0, -1) = (-1, 0)$.\n\nReduce r_c using r_b: The second element of r_c is $s$. Divide by $-1$. Quotient is $-s$.\nPerform $r_c \\to r_c - (-s)r_b = r_c + sr_b$.\n$(0, s) + s(0, -1) = (0, s-s) = (0, 0)$.\n\nThe final set of non-zero rows is $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. Re-introducing the zero rows, the final reduced matrix is:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe non-zero part is $R(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a GCRD of $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Finalize the answer**\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix. It is conventional to present the GCRD in a simple canonical form, like the row-echelon form.\nWe can multiply our resulting matrix $R(s)$ by the unimodular matrix $U(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (whose determinant is 1).\n$U(s)R(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$.\nThe identity matrix $I$ is also a GCRD and is in the simplest canonical form. When the GCRD is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the original matrices are called right coprime."
