    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given differential equation is $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$.\nEquilibrium points occur where $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square, $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are the equilibrium points. Setting each factor to zero, we get:\n$x = 0$\n$(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of the equilibrium points**\n\nTo determine the stability, we can analyze the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of each equilibrium point (Phase Line Analysis) or use the derivative test.\n\n**Method 1: Phase Line Analysis**\nThe function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$. The term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative. Therefore, the sign of $f(x)$ is determined by the sign of $-x$.\n*   **Case 1: $x < 0$**\n    Let's pick a test point, say $x=-1$.\n    $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = (1)(-2)^2 = 4 > 0$.\n    Since $f(x) > 0$, $x(t)$ is increasing. The flow is to the right ($\\rightarrow$).\n*   **Case 2: $0 < x < 1$**\n    Let's pick a test point, say $x=0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -(0.5)(0.5-1)^2 = -(0.5)(-0.5)^2 = -0.125 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing. The flow is to the left ($\\leftarrow$).\n*   **Case 3: $x > 1$**\n    Let's pick a test point, say $x=2$.\n    $f(2) = -(2)(2-1)^2 = -(2)(1)^2 = -2 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing. The flow is to the left ($\\leftarrow$).\n\n**Phase Line Diagram:**\n$$ \\xrightarrow{\\quad\\quad} 0 \\xleftarrow{\\quad\\quad} 1 \\xleftarrow{\\quad\\quad} $$\n\n**Interpreting the stability:**\n*   **For $x=0$**: To the left of 0, the flow is to the right (towards 0). To the right of 0, the flow is to the left (towards 0). Since solutions on both sides approach $x=0$, it is a **stable** equilibrium point.\n*   **For $x=1$**: To the left of 1, the flow is to the left (away from 1). To the right of 1, the flow is to the left (towards 1). Since the flow is towards the point on one side and away from it on the other, $x=1$ is a **semistable** equilibrium point.\n\n**Method 2: The Derivative Test**\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$.\n*   For an equilibrium point $x_0$, if $f'(x_0) < 0$, it is stable. If $f'(x_0) > 0$, it is unstable. If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the test is inconclusive.\n*   **Test $x=0$**:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n*   **Test $x=1$**:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    The test is inconclusive, confirming the need for the phase line analysis which showed $x=1$ is semistable.\n\n**Step 3: Find the value of m**\n\nThe problem defines $m$ as the number of **stable** equilibrium points.\nFrom our analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expression**\n\nWe need to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Finding all equilibria:** Correctly factorizing the polynomial $f(x)=-x(x-1)^2$ to find all roots, $x=0$ and the repeated root $x=1$.\n2.  **Definition of Stability:** A stable equilibrium point attracts solutions from both sides. Semistable points are not considered stable in this context.\n3.  **Inconclusive Derivative Test:** Recognizing that $f'(1)=0$ requires a different method (like the phase line analysis) to determine the stability of the equilibrium point $x=1$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Performing the final substitution and calculation correctly.\n\nThe final answer is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
