    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and find its irreducible factors.**\nLet $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We look for a factorization by grouping terms.\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$P(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n*   $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=2$. Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=3$. The coefficients are $1, 0, 0, 0, -9, 3$. The prime $p=3$ divides all coefficients except the leading one ($3 \\nmid 1$), and $p^2=9$ does not divide the constant term ($9 \\nmid 3$). Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field K.**\nLet $K$ be the splitting field of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. $K$ is the smallest field containing all roots of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\nLet $L_f$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. $L_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nLet $L_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5. Its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(L_g/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n*   To identify the specific subgroup, we determine the number of real roots of $g(x)$. The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    *   $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)^{5/4} - 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5-9)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = (-36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3$. Since $1 < \\sqrt[4]{9/5} < 2$, we have $7.2 < (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} < 14.4$. Thus $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) < 3 - 7.2 < 0$. This is a local minimum.\n    *   $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(9/5)^{5/4} + 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 > 0$. This is a local maximum.\n*   Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots.\n*   A well-known theorem states that an irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has the symmetric group $S_5$ as its Galois group. So, $\\text{Gal}(L_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum of $L_f$ and $L_g$, i.e., $K = L_f L_g$. The Galois group of the compositum, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(L_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(L_g/\\mathbb{Q})$. The isomorphism $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(L_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(L_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ holds if and only if $L_f \\cap L_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   $L_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Any quadratic subfield of $L_g$ must be $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\n    The discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\n    For $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$, $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n    $\\Delta_g = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\n    The only quadratic subfield of $L_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This field is clearly not equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Therefore, $L_f \\cap L_g = \\mathbb{Q}$, and the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(L_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(L_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = |C_2| \\times |S_5| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$. So $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=240$.\n\n**Step 3: Find normal sub-extensions and their degrees.**\nWe are looking for normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions correspond to proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\n**Step 4: Identify all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.**\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group), and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ include product subgroups $N_1 \\times N_2$ (where $N_1 \\triangleleft G_1, N_2 \\triangleleft G_2$) and potentially other \"skew\" subgroups.\n\n**A. Product-type normal subgroups:**\nExcluding the trivial subgroups $G = C_2 \\times S_5$ (which corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$) and $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (which corresponds to $L=K$), the proper non-trivial product subgroups are:\n1.  $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$. $|H_1| = |A_5| = 60$.\n2.  $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$. $|H_2| = |S_5| = 120$.\n3.  $H_3 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_3| = |C_2| = 2$.\n4.  $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$. $|H_4| = |C_2| \\times |A_5| = 2 \\times 60 = 120$.\n\n**B. Skew normal subgroups:**\nThese arise from isomorphisms between central factors of the component groups. The only non-trivial common quotient group of $C_2$ and $S_5$ is $C_2$, since $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. This gives rise to one additional normal subgroup. Let $\\text{sgn}: S_5 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}$ be the sign homomorphism, and let the isomorphism $C_2 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}$ be the identity map.\n5.  $H_5 = \\{(c, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid c = \\text{sgn}(\\sigma)\\}$. This is a normal subgroup. For any $\\sigma \\in S_5$, there is a unique $c \\in C_2$ such that $(c, \\sigma) \\in H_5$. Thus, $|H_5| = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the degrees of the corresponding extensions.**\nThe possible degrees of the normal intermediate fields $L$ are the indices $[G:H] = 240/|H|$ for the subgroups listed above.\n1.  For $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: degree = $240 / 60 = 4$.\n2.  For $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: degree = $240 / 120 = 2$.\n3.  For $H_3 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: degree = $240 / 2 = 120$.\n4.  For $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$: degree = $240 / 120 = 2$.\n5.  For $H_5$ (skew subgroup): degree = $240 / 120 = 2$.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees is obtained by collecting the distinct values from this list.\n\nThe possible degrees are $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
