    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Event:** The question focuses on the Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and specifically asks for the location of his *first major defeat* in the territory of modern-day Vietnam.\n\n2.  **Contextualize Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam:** Mu Sheng was a key military commander during the Yongle Emperor's reign and was involved in two major periods of conflict in Vietnam:\n    *   **The Initial Ming Invasion (1406-1407):** Mu Sheng, along with Zhang Fu, led the successful invasion that overthrew the Hồ dynasty. This campaign was marked by Ming victories, not defeats for its main commanders.\n    *   **The Lam Sơn Uprising (1418-1427):** This was a long-running rebellion led by Lê Lợi against Ming rule. Mu Sheng was repeatedly tasked with suppressing this uprising, and it was during this conflict that the Ming forces suffered significant setbacks. This is the period we must examine for his defeats.\n\n3.  **Differentiate Between Mu Sheng's Final Defeat and His First Defeat:** It is crucial not to confuse his final, most catastrophic defeat with his first one.\n    *   **Final Defeat (1427):** Mu Sheng's most famous defeat occurred in 1427. He was leading a relief army from Yunnan to save the besieged Ming forces. After learning that the other Ming army under Liu Sheng had been annihilated at the Chi Lăng Pass (in modern **Lạng Sơn Province**), Mu Sheng's army lost morale. It was subsequently attacked and routed by Vietnamese forces at locations like Cần Trạm and Lãnh Câu Pass (in the region of modern **Tuyên Quang** and **Phú Thọ** provinces). While a massive defeat, this was the final one, not the first.\n\n4.  **Identify the First Major Defeat:** We must look for an earlier battle where Mu Sheng was in command and his forces were decisively beaten.\n    *   In 1424, the Lam Sơn rebels, led by Lê Lợi, shifted their strategy and moved into the rich coastal province of Nghệ An, laying siege to the main Ming citadel there.\n    *   In response, in 1425, Mu Sheng led a large Ming army from the capital, Đông Quan (modern Hanoi), southward to relieve the siege and destroy the rebel army.\n    *   This campaign led to the **Battle of Khả Lưu**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Battle of Khả Lưu (1425):**\n    *   **Command:** Mu Sheng was the overall commander of the Ming expeditionary force.\n    *   **Outcome:** The Ming army was defeated by the Lam Sơn forces. The Ming commander on the ground, Li An (李安), was killed in the battle.\n    *   **Consequence:** This defeat was a major strategic blow to the Ming. Mu Sheng was unable to break the siege of Nghệ An and was forced to retreat with his main army back to Đông Quan. This represented the first time a campaign personally led by Mu Sheng against the Lam Sơn rebels had ended in a clear and major defeat.\n\n6.  **Locate the Battlefield in a Modern Province:** The Battle of Khả Lưu took place along the Lam River (Sông Lam). This area is definitively located within the modern-day Vietnamese province of **Nghệ An**.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguish between generals:** Ensure the defeat is attributed to Mu Sheng, not other Ming generals like Wang Tong (who was defeated at Tốt Động-Chúc Động) or Liu Sheng (defeated at Chi Lăng).\n*   **Focus on \"First Major Defeat\":** The question is specific about the *first* major defeat, not the most famous or the final one. The 1427 rout was his last battle, not his first loss.\n*   **Correlate the Battle with the Province:** The Battle of Khả Lưu (Mu Sheng's first major defeat) occurred in Nghệ An. The Battle of Chi Lăng (Liu Sheng's defeat) was in Lạng Sơn. The rout of Mu Sheng's final army was in the Tuyên Quang/Phú Thọ area. It's essential to connect the correct event to the correct location.\n*   **Confirm the Commander:** While a subordinate general (Li An) was killed at Khả Lưu, Mu Sheng was the supreme commander of the overall operation, making it his strategic defeat.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify Nghệ An as the province where Mu Sheng experienced his first major military failure in the war.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
