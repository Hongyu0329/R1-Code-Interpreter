    "This question asks for the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene molecule (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the atoms in the molecule.**\nThe chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\nThis means the molecule contains:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a type of Pople basis set, specifically a split-valence basis set. We need to determine how many contracted Gaussian functions (also called basis functions) it assigns to each type of atom (Carbon and Hydrogen).\n\n*   **For non-Hydrogen atoms (like Carbon):**\n    *   **Core Orbitals (1s for Carbon):** The \"6-\" part describes the core electrons. It means that the core orbitals are represented by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is constructed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions. So, this gives **1 contracted function** for the core.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p for Carbon):** The \"-31G\" part describes the valence electrons. This is a \"split-valence\" description, meaning the valence shell is represented by two sets of functions of different sizes (an \"inner\" and \"outer\" part).\n        *   Each valence atomic orbital (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) is described by two contracted functions.\n        *   Carbon has one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz), for a total of 4 valence atomic orbitals.\n        *   The number of contracted functions for the valence shell is 2 functions/orbital * 4 orbitals = **8 contracted functions**.\n    *   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons. The \"6-\" part does not apply.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (1s for Hydrogen):** The \"-31G\" part applies to the valence shell. It's a split-valence description.\n        *   The single 1s valence orbital of Hydrogen is described by two contracted functions (an \"inner\" and \"outer\" part).\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** **2 contracted functions**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of contracted functions for the entire molecule.**\nNow we multiply the number of functions per atom by the number of atoms of that type in toluene (C7H8) and sum the results.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:**\n    *   Number of Carbon atoms = 7\n    *   Contracted functions per Carbon atom = 9\n    *   Total from Carbon = 7 * 9 = **63 contracted functions**\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:**\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 8\n    *   Contracted functions per Hydrogen atom = 2\n    *   Total from Hydrogen = 8 * 2 = **16 contracted functions**\n\n*   **Total for the molecule:**\n    *   Total functions = (Total from Carbon) + (Total from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total functions = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Molecule Composition:** Be sure to correctly identify the number of each type of atom from the formula C7H8 (7 Carbons, 8 Hydrogens).\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Correctly interpret what \"6-31G\" means for each element. The hyphen separates the core (6) from the valence (31) description. Hydrogen has no core.\n3.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* functions, which are the basis functions used in the calculation. The numbers 6, 3, and 1 in the basis set name refer to the number of *primitive* Gaussian functions used to build the contracted functions, which is a different quantity.\n4.  **Valence Orbitals:** Remember that for Carbon (a second-row element), the valence shell includes one s-orbital and three p-orbitals. For Hydrogen, it is just one s-orbital.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Sum the contributions from all atoms in the molecule.\n\nFollowing these steps ensures an accurate count. The total number of contracted Gaussian functions is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
