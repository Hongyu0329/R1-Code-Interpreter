    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nLet $S = \\{k^2 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$ be the set of perfect square numbers.\nWe are looking for a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ such that its sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ has no elements in common with $S$. That is, $(A+A) \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\nThe problem asks for the largest number $c$ such that such a set $A$ can exist with size $|A| = (c+o(1))N$. The term $o(1)$ represents a function of $N$ that tends to zero as $N \\to \\infty$. This means we are looking for the maximum possible asymptotic density of a square-sum-free set.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound for $c$ by Construction\nA common technique for this type of problem is to construct a set $A$ with the desired property and calculate its density. We can use modular arithmetic to restrict the sums $a_1+a_2$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Choice of Modulus**\nLet's analyze the sums modulo a small integer $m$. Let $Q_m$ be the set of quadratic residues modulo $m$. We want to find a set of residues $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$ such that for any $r_1, r_2 \\in R$, their sum $r_1+r_2 \\pmod m$ is not in $Q_m$. If we can find such an $R$, we can construct our set $A$ as $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$. The density of this set would be $|R|/m$.\n\n**Analysis with Modulus 3:**\n1.  The integers are partitioned into three residue classes modulo 3: $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n2.  The squares modulo 3 are:\n    $0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n    $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n    So, the set of quadratic residues is $Q_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$. Any integer that is a perfect square must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3.\n3.  Let's choose a residue class $r$ for our set $A$. Let $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv r \\pmod 3\\}$. For any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum is $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2r \\pmod 3$.\n4.  We need to choose $r$ such that $2r \\pmod 3$ is not a quadratic residue modulo 3. That is, $2r \\pmod 3 \\notin \\{0, 1\\}$. The only possibility is $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n    - If $r=0$, $2r=0 \\in Q_3$. This fails.\n    - If $r=1$, $2r=2 \\notin Q_3$. This works.\n    - If $r=2$, $2r=4 \\equiv 1 \\in Q_3$. This fails.\n5.  So, the choice $r=1$ works. Let's construct the set $A$ with this property:\n    $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\} = \\{1, 4, 7, \\dots\\}$.\n6.  For any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, so $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n7.  Since any square number $k^2$ must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3, $k^2$ can never be congruent to 2 modulo 3. Thus, $a_1+a_2$ can never be a perfect square.\n8.  The size of this set $A$ is approximately $N/3$. More precisely, $|A| = \\lfloor\\frac{N-1}{3}\\rfloor+1$ (if $N\\ge 1$), which is $N/3+O(1)$.\n9.  The density is $|A|/N = (N/3+O(1))/N = 1/3+o(1)$.\nThis construction shows that we can achieve a density of $1/3$. Therefore, the largest possible value for $c$ must be at least $1/3$, i.e., $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Exploring other constructions**\nWe could try other moduli. For instance, modulo 4, the squares are $\\{0,1\\}$. We could choose $A=\\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$; then $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, which is not a square modulo 4. This gives density $1/4$. Or $A=\\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$; then $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$, giving density $1/4$. These are not better than $1/3$. Trying other moduli or more complex constructions of residue sets $R$ does not seem to yield a better density. For example, using modulus 9, the set of residues $R=\\{1,4,7\\}$ gives density $3/9=1/3$, but this is exactly the same set as $\\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding an Upper Bound for $c$\nProving that $c$ cannot be larger than $1/3$ is more challenging and requires concepts from additive combinatorics.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Heuristic Argument for the Upper Bound**\nLet's partition any given set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ into three subsets based on their residues modulo 3:\n$A_0 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$\n$A_1 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n$A_2 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$\nThe sumset $A+A$ is the union of subset sums like $A_0+A_0, A_1+A_1, A_0+A_1$, etc.\nLet's check their sums modulo 3:\n-   $A_1+A_1$: sums are $\\equiv 1+1=2 \\pmod 3$. These sums are 'safe' as no square is $2 \\pmod 3$.\n-   $A_0+A_2$: sums are $\\equiv 0+2=2 \\pmod 3$. These sums are also 'safe'.\n-   $A_0+A_0$: sums are $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. These are 'dangerous' because they can be squares (e.g., $3+6=9$).\n-   $A_2+A_2$: sums are $\\equiv 2+2=4\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. 'Dangerous' (e.g. $2+2=4$ is disallowed, so $2 \\notin A$; $8+8=16$ is disallowed, so $8 \\notin A$).\n-   $A_0+A_1$: sums are $\\equiv 0+1=1 \\pmod 3$. 'Dangerous'.\n-   $A_1+A_2$: sums are $\\equiv 1+2=3\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. 'Dangerous'.\n\nThe construction from Step 2 populated only $A_1$ and set $A_0, A_2$ to be empty. This made all sums 'safe'. To get a density greater than $1/3$, we must draw a significant number of elements from $\\{n \\le N: n \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$, meaning $|A_0|+|A_2|$ must be non-negligible. However, adding elements to $A_0$ or $A_2$ creates many 'dangerous' pairs whose sums must be checked. It turns out that the constraints imposed by these dangerous pairs are so strong that they prevent the total density from exceeding $1/3$.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Rigorous Upper Bound**\nThis problem has been studied by professional mathematicians. A paper by J. Cilleruelo, S. Z. Kiss, I. Z. Ruzsa, and C. Vinuesa (2019) proved that for any square-sum-free set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, its size is bounded by $|A| \\le \\frac{N}{3} + O(N^{3/4})$.\nThis inequality can be rewritten in terms of density:\n$\\frac{|A|}{N} \\le \\frac{1}{3} + O(N^{-1/4})$.\nThe term $O(N^{-1/4})$ goes to 0 as $N \\to \\infty$. So for any $\\epsilon > 0$, for sufficiently large $N$, we have $|A|/N < 1/3 + \\epsilon$. This implies that the asymptotic density $c$ cannot be greater than $1/3$. So, $c \\le 1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nFrom Step 2, we have a construction that shows $c \\ge 1/3$.\nFrom Step 3, we have a result from number theory that shows $c \\le 1/3$.\nCombining these two bounds, we find that the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $1/3$."
