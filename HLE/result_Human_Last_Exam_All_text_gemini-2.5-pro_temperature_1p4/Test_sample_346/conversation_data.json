    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Expression and Identify Key Combinators\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break this down into smaller, manageable parts and define some aliases:\n*   Let `Op = S(S(K(S))(K))`. This operator appears twice.\n*   The expression has a repeating structure of `S(I)`. Let's analyze this first.\n*   The expression contains terms that represent Church numerals. We will use the common encoding where a numeral `n` is a function `λf.λx. f^n x`.\n    *   `1` is represented by `I`. `I f x = f x` is not quite right, but `(I f) x = f x` is. Let's test this representation.\n    *   `2` is `S(I)(I)`. Let's verify: `(S I I) f x = (I f (I f)) x = f (f x)`. This is correct.\n    *   Addition of two numerals `m` and `n` is `S m n`: `(S m n) f x = m f (n f x) = f^m(f^n(x)) = f^(m+n)(x)`. So `S` is addition.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the `S(I)` Combinator\n\nThe combinator `S(I)` appears frequently. Let's analyze its behavior in two contexts.\n\n1.  **As a unary operator (Successor):** When applied to a single Church numeral `n`, `S(I)` acts as the successor function (`SUCC`).\n    `SUCC n = S(I) n`.\n    Let's verify: `( (S I) n ) f x = (I f (n f)) x = f( (n f) x ) = f( f^n(x) ) = f^(n+1)(x)`. This is correct.\n\n2.  **As a binary operator:** When applied to two arguments `a` and `b`, `S(I)` behaves according to the `S` rule.\n    `S(I) a b = I b (a b) = b (a b)`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Operator `Op = S(S(K(S))(K))`\n\nThis is the most complex part.\n\n*   First, note that `K(S)` is extensionally equivalent to `K S` because `(K(S)) x = S` and `(K S) x = S`.\n*   Let `B = S(K S)K`. This is the well-known composition combinator: `B f g x = f(g x)`.\n*   So, `Op = S(B)(K)`.\n*   Let's see how `Op` acts on two Church numerals, `m` and `n`: `Op m n`.\n*   The `S` combinator is applied first: `S B K m = B m (K m)`.\n*   Now, we apply this result to `n`: `(B m (K m)) n = B m n (K m n)`. This evaluation is incorrect. Let's correct it:\n    `(B m (K m)) n = m ( (K m) n)`.\n*   Since `K m n = m`, the expression simplifies to `m(m)`.\n*   This means the Church numeral `m` is applied to itself. Let's evaluate this:\n    `m(m) = (λf.λx. f^m x) (m)`. Here, `f` becomes `m`.\n    `= λx. m^m x`.\n*   The term `m^m` means the function `m` composed with itself `m` times. Let's find what numeral this represents.\n    Let `h_k = m^k`. We want to evaluate `(h_k f) x`.\n    `(h_1 f) x = (m f) x = f^m x`.\n    `(h_2 f) x = (m (m f)) x = (m (λy. f^m y)) x = (λy. f^m y)^m x = (f^m)^m x = f^(m^2) x`.\n    By induction, `(h_k f) x = f^(m^k) x`.\n    Therefore, `(m^m f) x = f^(m^m) x`.\n*   This means `m(m)` evaluates to the Church numeral for the integer `m^m`.\n*   So, `Op m n = m^m`. The operator `Op` takes a numeral `m`, raises it to the power of itself, and ignores the second argument `n`.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Main Expression\n\nLet's rewrite the expression with our aliases:\n`E = S(I) ( S(I) ( S(I) ( K(Op I) ) ( Op (S I I) ) ) )`\n\nHere the parentheses indicate that `S(I)` is applied to one argument at each step, which means it acts as the successor function (`SUCC`).\n\nLet's evaluate the innermost term `Z = S(I) (K(Op I)) (Op (S I I))`. The parsing here is critical. `S(I)` has two arguments here.\n`E = SUCC( SUCC( Z ) )`.\n\n1.  Evaluate the arguments for `Z`.\n    *   Argument `a = K(Op I)`.\n        *   `Op I = 1^1 = 1`.\n        *   So `a = K(1)`.\n    *   Argument `b = Op (S I I)`.\n        *   `S I I` is the numeral `2`.\n        *   `Op 2 = 2^2 = 4`.\n        *   So `b` is the numeral `4`.\n\n2.  Evaluate `Z = S(I) a b = S(I) (K 1) 4`.\n    *   Using the binary rule `S(I) a b = b(ab)`:\n    *   `Z = 4 ( (K 1) 4 )`.\n    *   `K 1 4 = 1`.\n    *   So, `Z = 4(1)`.\n\n3.  Evaluate `4(1)`. This is the Church numeral `4` applied to the Church numeral `1` as its function argument.\n    *   `4(1) = (λf.λx. f^4 x) (1) = λx. 1^4 x`.\n    *   `1^4` means the numeral `1` composed with itself 4 times.\n    *   Let's check `1 o 1`. Let `h=1=λf.f`. `(1 o 1) f = 1(1(f)) = 1(f) = f`. So `1 o 1 = I = 1`.\n    *   By induction, `1^4 = 1`.\n    *   So, `4(1) = λx. 1 x = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `Z` evaluates to the Church numeral `1`.\n\n4.  Substitute `Z=1` back into the full expression `E = SUCC( SUCC( Z ) )`.\n    *   `E = SUCC( SUCC(1) )`\n    *   `SUCC(1) = 2`\n    *   `SUCC(2) = 3`\n\nThe entire expression evaluates to the Church numeral `n=3`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\nSince `n=3`, we need to calculate `log_2(3)`.\n\n`log_2(3) ≈ 1.5849625`\n\n<<<1.5849625>>>"
