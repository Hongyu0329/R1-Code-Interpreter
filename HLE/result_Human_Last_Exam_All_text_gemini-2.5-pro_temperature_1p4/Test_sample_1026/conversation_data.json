    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Conservation Laws:**\n    The system consists of the small mass `m` and the guide `M`. The guide rests on a horizontal, frictionless plane. This is a critical piece of information. Because there is no friction with the ground, there are no external horizontal forces acting on the system as a whole. According to Newton's laws, if the net external horizontal force on a system is zero, the horizontal momentum of the system is conserved. Since the system starts from rest, its total horizontal momentum is initially zero and will remain zero throughout the motion.\n\n2.  **Center of Mass (CoM) Motion:**\n    A direct consequence of the conservation of momentum for a system starting at rest is that the center of mass (CoM) of the system does not move horizontally. Its horizontal coordinate remains constant throughout the entire process. We can express this as `ŒîX_CoM = 0`.\n\n3.  **Define States:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The mass `m` is at the top of the left quarter-arc (point A). The entire system is at rest.\n    *   **Final State:** The mass `m` has moved to the other side of the guide and reached its maximum height `h`. This completes the \"first half-oscillation\". At this point, the mass `m` is momentarily at rest relative to the guide `M`. Because the total horizontal momentum of the system must be zero, both the mass `m` and the guide `M` must be momentarily at rest in the laboratory frame of reference.\n\n4.  **Set Up a Coordinate System:**\n    Let's set up a horizontal x-axis in the laboratory frame. Let the origin `x=0` be the initial horizontal position of the left end of the guide.\n    *   Initial horizontal position of mass `m`: `x_m,i = 0`.\n    *   To find the initial position of the guide's CoM (`X_M,i`), we need its geometry. The guide's total horizontal length is `L = R + d + R = 0.20 m + 0.50 m + 0.20 m = 0.90 m`. Assuming the guide's mass is distributed symmetrically, its CoM is at its geometric center, which is at `L/2` from its left end.\n    *   Initial horizontal position of the guide's CoM: `X_M,i = L/2 = 0.90 m / 2 = 0.45 m`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Initial Position of the System's CoM:**\n    The horizontal position of the system's CoM (`X_CoM`) is given by the formula:\n    `X_CoM = (m * x_m + M * X_M) / (m + M)`\n    `X_CoM,initial = (0.20 * 0 + 0.80 * 0.45) / (0.20 + 0.80) = (0.36) / 1.0 = 0.36 m`.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Final State:**\n    Let `S` be the horizontal displacement of the guide. As the mass `m` moves to the right, the guide `M` will move to the left to conserve momentum, so we expect `S` to be negative.\n    *   The new horizontal position of the left end of the guide is `S`.\n    *   In the final state, the mass `m` is at the far right of its horizontal travel along the guide. Its horizontal position *relative to the guide's left end* is `R + d = 0.20 m + 0.50 m = 0.70 m`.\n    *   The absolute final horizontal position of mass `m` in the lab frame is `x_m,f = S + (R + d) = S + 0.70`.\n    *   The absolute final horizontal position of the guide's CoM is its initial position plus the displacement `S`: `X_M,f = X_M,i + S = 0.45 + S`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Position of the System's CoM:**\n    `X_CoM,final = (m * x_m,f + M * X_M,f) / (m + M)`\n    `X_CoM,final = (0.20 * (S + 0.70) + 0.80 * (0.45 + S)) / (0.20 + 0.80)`\n    `X_CoM,final = (0.20*S + 0.14 + 0.36 + 0.80*S) / 1.0`\n    `X_CoM,final = S + 0.50`.\n\n8.  **Apply CoM Conservation and Solve for the Displacement `S`:**\n    Since `X_CoM,initial = X_CoM,final`:\n    `0.36 = S + 0.50`\n    `S = 0.36 - 0.50 = -0.14 m`.\n\n    The result `S = -0.14 m` means the guide has moved `0.14 m` to the left. The question asks for the horizontal displacement of the guide. The magnitude of this displacement is `0.14 m`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Friction is an Internal Force:** The friction between the mass `m` and the guide's straight section `d` is an internal force to the `m+M` system. Internal forces cannot change the total momentum of the system. Therefore, the value of the coefficient of friction `ŒºD = 0.20` is irrelevant for this specific calculation. It would be needed to calculate the final height `h`, but not the guide's displacement.\n*   **Definition of \"Half-Oscillation\":** This term defines the final state as the point where the mass `m` reaches its turning point on the opposite side. At this instant, the velocities of both `m` and `M` are zero, which simplifies the analysis as we only need to compare the initial and final positions.\n*   **Guide's Center of Mass:** The calculation relies on the assumption that the guide's mass `M` is distributed symmetrically, placing its CoM at its geometric horizontal center. This is a standard assumption in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Displacement vs. Position:** Using displacements can be more direct. Let `S` be the guide's displacement. The displacement of the mass `m` is `Œîx_m = S + Œîx_rel`, where `Œîx_rel = 0.70 m` is the displacement of `m` relative to the guide. The conservation of CoM position (`ŒîX_CoM = 0`) gives `m*Œîx_m + M*S = 0`. Substituting gives `m*(S + Œîx_rel) + M*S = 0`, which leads to the same result `S = -m*Œîx_rel / (m+M) = -0.14 m`.\n\nThe final answer is the magnitude of the displacement `S`.\n\nFinal Answer: 0.14 m.\n\n<<<0.14>>>"
