    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle to find the transformation rule.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to determine the rule that transforms the input string into the output string. This rule must be consistent across all provided examples. Then, we must apply this rule to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Input_A and Output_A**\n*   **Input_A:** `'001111,121111,111111'`\n*   **Output_A:** `'201111,101111,111111'`\n\nLet's represent the input as a grid (using 0-based indexing for rows and columns):\n```\n// Input_A Grid\nR0: 0 0 1 1 1 1\nR1: 1 2 1 1 1 1\nR2: 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\nComparing the input and output grids, we see two changes:\n1.  The `0` at position `(0, 0)` becomes a `2`.\n2.  The `2` at position `(1, 1)` becomes a `0`.\n\nThis is a swap of values between the locations `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`. The digit `2` seems to be the \"actor\" in this transformation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Input_B and Output_B**\n*   **Input_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'`\n*   **Output_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`\n\nLet's locate the changes:\n1.  In Row 2 (`1111000011110`), the `0` at column index 7 becomes a `2`. Position `(2, 7)`.\n2.  In Row 3 (`1111002111111`), the `2` at column index 6 becomes a `0`. Position `(3, 6)`.\n\nAgain, this is a swap. The `2` at `(3, 6)` has swapped places with the `0` at `(2, 7)`.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis for the Transformation Rule**\nThe `2` moves to a new location, swapping with a `0`. We need to find the rule that determines the target location. Let the position of the `2` be `(r, c)`.\n\n*   In A: `(r, c) = (1, 1)`. The target is `(0, 0)`, which is `(r-1, c-1)`.\n*   In B: `(r, c) = (3, 6)`. The target is `(2, 7)`, which is `(r-1, c+1)`.\n\nNotice a pattern related to the parity (odd/even) of the coordinates:\n*   In A: `r=1` (odd), `c=1` (odd). The move is Up (`r-1`) and Left (`c-1`).\n*   In B: `r=3` (odd), `c=6` (even). The move is Up (`r-1`) and Right (`c+1`).\n\nThis leads to the following hypothesis:\n1.  Find the first occurrence of the digit `2` at position `(r, c)`.\n2.  Determine the target direction based on the parity of `r` and `c`:\n    *   If `r` is odd, the vertical move is Up (new row = `r-1`). If `r` is even, Down (`r+1`).\n    *   If `c` is odd, the horizontal move is Left (new col = `c-1`). If `c` is even, Right (`c+1`).\n3.  The swap only occurs if the value at the target location is `0`.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Input_C and the 'MISSING' Output**\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   **Output_C:** `'MISSING'`\n\nThe term `MISSING` implies we need to calculate the correct output. We will apply our rule. The fact that the problem statement calls it `MISSING` might be a hint that the transformation could fail, or it might just be a placeholder for the answer we need to find. Given our rule is consistent for A and B, we proceed with applying it to C.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the Rule to Input_C**\n1.  **Grid for Input_C:**\n    ```\n    R0: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    R1: 0 1 1 1 2 0\n    R2: 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n2.  **Find the `2`:** It is at position `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n3.  **Determine Target:**\n    *   `r = 1` is odd, so the vertical move is Up (`r-1 = 0`).\n    *   `c = 4` is even, so the horizontal move is Right (`c+1 = 5`).\n    *   The target position is `(0, 5)`.\n4.  **Check Target Value:** The value in the grid at `(0, 5)` is `0`. The condition for the swap is met.\n5.  **Perform the Swap:**\n    *   The value at `(1, 4)` (`2`) is swapped with the value at `(0, 5)` (`0`).\n6.  **Construct the Final Grid:**\n    ```\n    R0: 0 0 0 0 0 2\n    R1: 0 1 1 1 0 0\n    R2: 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n7.  **Format as String:** Concatenating the rows with commas gives the final answer.\n\n`000002,011100,111111`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
