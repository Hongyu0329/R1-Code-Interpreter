    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nFirst, let's break down the core components of the question:\n*   **The Theory:** We are working with the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge, which states: S knows that p if and only if (i) S believes that p, (ii) p is true, and (iii) S is justified in believing that p.\n*   **The Primary Constraint:** Our only available epistemic states (the states a subject S can be in with respect to a proposition p) are 'Knowledge' and 'Belief'. This is a highly artificial constraint and is the key to the problem. It forces any given state to be classified into one of these two boxes.\n*   **The Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems challenge the *sufficiency* of the JTB conditions (i.e., showing cases of JTB that aren't knowledge). We must look for other kinds of problems.\n*   **The Goal:** Identify two distinct problems that the JTB framework runs into under these specific constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Implications of the Constraint\nThe constraint that the only two epistemic states are 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' creates a rigid, binary classification system. This implies:\n1.  **Mutual Exclusivity:** A state is either 'Knowledge' or 'Belief', but not both. This immediately clashes with the JTB formulation where Knowledge is described as a *type* of belief. This tension is the source of the problems.\n2.  **Exhaustiveness:** There are no other states. If a mental state regarding a proposition is not 'Knowledge', it *must* be 'Belief'. This makes 'Belief' the default or catch-all category for anything that fails the JTB test for knowledge.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the First Problem - The Loss of Epistemic Distinction\nThis problem arises from what gets categorized as 'Belief'.\n\n1.  According to JTB, knowledge is a Justified True Belief (J+T+B).\n2.  According to the constraint, any state that is not knowledge must be 'Belief'.\n3.  Let's consider the states that fail to be knowledge:\n    *   **Justified False Belief (J & ~T & B):** Someone has good reasons for their belief, but it turns out to be false (e.g., trusting a reliable-looking clock that has stopped).\n    *   **Unjustified True Belief (~J & T & B):** Someone has a belief that happens to be true but for no good reason (e.g., a lucky guess).\n    *   **Unjustified False Belief (~J & ~T & B):** Someone has a belief that is neither justified nor true (e.g., groundless superstition).\n4.  Under the given constraints, all three of these very different epistemic situations are lumped into the single category of 'Belief'.\n5.  **The Problem:** The concept of 'justification' is a cornerstone of epistemology, used to evaluate the rational standing of a belief, regardless of its truth. By lumping justified false beliefs together with unjustified beliefs, the framework loses this crucial distinction. The classificatory power of 'justification' is nullified for any state that falls short of being knowledge.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Second Problem - Circularity and Definitional Incoherence\nThis problem arises from the relationship between the definition of 'Knowledge' and the definition of 'Belief'.\n\n1.  **JTB Definition:** The definition explicitly states, \"Knowledge is a Justified True **Belief**\". This means the concept of 'Belief' is a necessary component and logical prerequisite for 'Knowledge'. To check if something is knowledge, you must first establish that it is a belief.\n2.  **Constraint's Implication:** As established, the constraint makes 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' mutually exclusive categories. This means that the category 'Belief' is defined as any epistemic state that is *not* Knowledge (`Belief` <=> `not Knowledge`).\n3.  **The Contradiction:** We are now faced with a circular and incoherent definitional loop:\n    *   To determine if a state is **Knowledge**, you must first verify that it is a **Belief**.\n    *   But to determine if that state is a **Belief**, you must first verify that it is **not Knowledge**.\n4.  **The Problem:** You cannot begin the classification process. The definition of each category depends on the prior definition of the other, creating a logical paradox. The term 'Belief' is being used in two contradictory ways: as a foundational component *within* the definition of Knowledge, and as a final category that is mutually exclusive *with* Knowledge. This makes the entire framework incoherent.\n\nThese two problems—the lumping of distinct non-knowledge states and the logical circularity of the definitions—are direct consequences of applying the JTB definition within the highly restrictive epistemic world described in the question.\n\n<<<Based on the analysis, the two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Lost Distinction (The Lumping Problem):** The binary system forces all non-knowledge states into a single category called 'Belief'. This means epistemically distinct states, such as a justified false belief, an unjustified true belief, and an unjustified false belief, are all lumped together. This nullifies the value of 'justification' as a tool for evaluating the quality of beliefs that are not knowledge, defeating one of its primary epistemic purposes.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Circularity / Definitional Incoherence:** The JTB definition states that \"Knowledge is a Justified True **Belief**,\" making the concept of 'Belief' a necessary precondition for 'Knowledge'. However, the constraint that 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' are the only two states makes them mutually exclusive, defining 'Belief' as any state that is *not* 'Knowledge'. This creates a vicious circle: to determine if a state is Knowledge, one must first confirm it is a Belief, but to determine if it is a Belief, one must first confirm it is *not* Knowledge. This logical contradiction makes the entire framework incoherent.>>>"
