Based on the analysis, the two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into are:

1.  **The Problem of Lost Distinction (The Lumping Problem):** The binary system forces all non-knowledge states into a single category called 'Belief'. This means epistemically distinct states, such as a justified false belief, an unjustified true belief, and an unjustified false belief, are all lumped together. This nullifies the value of 'justification' as a tool for evaluating the quality of beliefs that are not knowledge, defeating one of its primary epistemic purposes.

2.  **The Problem of Circularity / Definitional Incoherence:** The JTB definition states that "Knowledge is a Justified True **Belief**," making the concept of 'Belief' a necessary precondition for 'Knowledge'. However, the constraint that 'Knowledge' and 'Belief' are the only two states makes them mutually exclusive, defining 'Belief' as any state that is *not* 'Knowledge'. This creates a vicious circle: to determine if a state is Knowledge, one must first confirm it is a Belief, but to determine if it is a Belief, one must first confirm it is *not* Knowledge. This logical contradiction makes the entire framework incoherent.
