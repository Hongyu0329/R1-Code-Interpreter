Based on its role in promoting a persistent, memory-like T cell phenotype with high recall potential, interleukin-15 would be predicted to enhance and sustain the release of effector cytokines (like IFN-γ and TNF-α) in CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation, compared to T cells manufactured without it.
