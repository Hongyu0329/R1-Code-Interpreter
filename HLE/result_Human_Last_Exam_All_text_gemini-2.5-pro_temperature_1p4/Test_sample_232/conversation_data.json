    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of regions created by the fold lines of a standard origami crane.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question and Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **The Object:** A \"standard origami crane\". This implies the traditional Japanese *Tsuru*.\n*   **The Action:** Fold the crane completely, then unfold the paper to reveal the crease pattern.\n*   **The Question:** How many distinct, non-overlapping regions is the square piece of paper divided into by these crease lines?\n*   **Careful Point 1: What constitutes the \"standard\" crease pattern?**\n    *   The folding process can be broken down into stages. The most complex part is creating the \"bird base,\" which is a common foundation for many origami models.\n    *   After the bird base, there are additional \"shaping folds\": narrowing the neck and tail, folding the wings down, and crimping the head to form a beak.\n    *   The question could be interpreted as asking for the regions from the bird base only, or from the fully completed crane. A fully completed crane's crease pattern is a more accurate interpretation of the question \"Suppose I fold a standard origami crane\". We will analyze the crease pattern required to form the crane's final shape, excluding only the very last, minor crimp for the beak which can be variable. This includes the bird base creases *plus* the creases for narrowing the neck and tail.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: How to count the regions accurately?**\n    *   Counting small regions on a complex diagram can be prone to errors.\n    *   A more robust method is to use Euler's Formula for planar graphs, which relates the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces/regions (F) of a graph: `V - E + F = 2`.\n    *   The number of regions we want is `F - 1` (since F includes the unbounded region outside the paper). Therefore, `Regions = E - V + 1`.\n    *   We can use a direct count on a simplified part of the pattern (leveraging symmetry) and then cross-verify the result using Euler's formula on the entire pattern.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Crease Pattern**\n\nThe crease pattern of a finished crane includes the foundational \"bird base\" and the subsequent folds that narrow the points that become the neck and tail.\n\n*   **Part A: The Bird Base Pattern**\n    The bird base is symmetrical. Its crease pattern consists of:\n    *   The two diagonals of the square.\n    *   The horizontal and vertical center lines.\n    *   The creases required for the \"petal folds\" that form the base's diamond shape.\n\n*   **Part B: The Neck and Tail Narrowing Folds**\n    To give the crane its slender neck and tail, two of the opposing points of the bird base are narrowed. This adds new creases:\n    *   Two creases are added to the flap that becomes the neck.\n    *   Two identical creases are added to the flap that becomes the tail.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Answer**\n\nWe will use two methods to find the number of regions.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Counting using Symmetry**\n\n1.  **Regions from the Bird Base:** First, let's consider the regions created by just the bird base. The pattern is highly symmetrical. If we divide the square by its two diagonals and two median lines, we create 8 identical triangular \"wedges\". Within each of these wedges, there is exactly one additional crease that connects the median to the diagonal. This single crease divides each wedge into 2 smaller regions.\n    *   Number of regions in bird base = 8 wedges × 2 regions/wedge = **16 regions**.\n\n2.  **Adding Regions from Narrowing Folds:** Now, we add the four creases used to narrow the neck and tail.\n    *   The future neck is made from one of the four main points of the bird base. In the crease pattern, this point consists of two long, thin regions. The two narrowing folds are added here, one in each of these two regions.\n    *   Each new crease line divides an existing region into two, thus adding one new region.\n    *   Adding 2 creases for the neck adds **2 new regions**.\n    *   Similarly, adding 2 creases for the tail adds another **2 new regions**.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Total Regions = (Regions from Bird Base) + (New Regions from Neck) + (New Regions from Tail)\n    *   Total Regions = 16 + 2 + 2 = **20**.\n\n**Method 2: Using Euler's Formula (V - E + F = 2)**\n\nLet's model the crease pattern (including the paper's boundary) as a planar graph and count its vertices (V) and edges (E).\n\n1.  **Count Vertices (V):** These are the points where crease lines intersect or end.\n    *   Center of the paper: 1\n    *   Corners of the square paper: 4\n    *   Midpoints of the paper's four outer edges: 4\n    *   Interior \"ankle\" vertices on the diagonals: 4\n    *   Interior \"knee\" vertices on the medians: 4\n    *   Vertices where the neck/tail narrowing folds meet the paper's edge: 4\n    *   **Total V = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21**\n\n2.  **Count Edges (E):** These are the line segments (creases or boundary lines) connecting the vertices.\n    *   Creases from the center to the \"knee\" and \"ankle\" vertices: 8\n    *   Creases connecting \"knees\" to \"ankles\": 8\n    *   Creases from \"ankles\" to the paper's corners: 4\n    *   Creases from \"knees\" to the paper's edge midpoints: 4\n    *   The 4 new narrowing creases (from \"ankles\" to the new edge vertices): 4\n    *   Boundary edges of the paper: The 4 new vertices on the boundary split 4 of the original 8 boundary segments. So, the boundary now consists of 4 unsplit segments + (4 × 2) split segments = 12 edges.\n    *   **Total E = (8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 4) [creases] + 12 [boundary] = 28 + 12 = 40**\n\n3.  **Calculate Regions:**\n    *   Using the formula `Regions = E - V + 1`:\n    *   Regions = 40 - 21 + 1\n    *   Regions = 19 + 1 = **20**\n\nBoth methods produce the same result, confirming the analysis.\n\n<<<20>>>"
