    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of the given hypothesis class.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Definitions\n\n*   **Domain (X):** A set of points of size $|X| = T$.\n*   **Hypothesis Class ($H_{z-ones}$):** This is a set of functions (hypotheses) $h$, where each function maps points from the domain $X$ to a binary label $\\{0, 1\\}$. The defining characteristic of this class is that for any function $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, the number of points labeled '1' is exactly $z$.\n    *   $H_{z-ones} = \\{h: X \\to \\{0,1\\} \\text{ such that } |\\{x \\in X: h(x)=1\\}| = z\\}$.\n*   **VC Dimension:** The VC dimension of a hypothesis class $H$ is the size of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be *shattered* by $H$.\n*   **Shattering:** A set of points $S$ is shattered by $H$ if for every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$, there is a hypothesis $h \\in H$ that produces that exact labeling. For a set $S$ of size $d$, there are $2^d$ possible labelings.\n\n### 2. Analysis: Conditions for Shattering\n\nLet's take an arbitrary subset of the domain, $S \\subseteq X$, with size $|S| = d$. We want to find the largest possible value of $d$ for which $S$ can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nTo shatter $S$, we must be able to generate any of the $2^d$ possible labelings on $S$ using some hypothesis from $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary labeling for the points in $S$. Suppose this labeling assigns '1' to $k$ points in $S$ and '0' to the remaining $d-k$ points. Here, $k$ can be any integer from $0$ (all points in $S$ are labeled '0') to $d$ (all points in $S$ are labeled '1').\n\nFor this labeling to be achievable by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, the following must be true:\n1.  The $k$ points in $S$ must be labeled '1'.\n2.  The remaining $d-k$ points in $S$ must be labeled '0'.\n3.  The total number of points in the entire domain $X$ labeled '1' by $h$ must be exactly $z$.\n\nFrom points 1 and 3, we know that after labeling the $k$ required points in $S$ as '1', we must label exactly $z-k$ additional points as '1'. These additional points must come from the part of the domain that is outside of $S$, which is the set $X \\setminus S$.\n\nThis leads to two critical constraints for this labeling to be possible:\n\n*   **Constraint 1: The number of required '1's must be non-negative.**\n    We need to select $z-k$ points from $X \\setminus S$ to be '1'. This requires $z-k \\ge 0$, which simplifies to $k \\le z$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We cannot request more '1's on the subset $S$ than are allowed in total by any hypothesis in the class.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: We must have enough points outside S to assign the remaining '1's.**\n    The number of points available in $X \\setminus S$ is $|X \\setminus S| = |X| - |S| = T-d$. We need to choose $z-k$ points from this set. This is only possible if the number of points we need to choose is less than or equal to the number of points available. So, we must have $z-k \\le T-d$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We need a large enough \"pool\" of points outside our set $S$ to satisfy the global constraint of having exactly $z$ ones.\n\n### 3. Finding the Maximum Size of a Shattered Set (The VC Dimension)\n\nFor the set $S$ of size $d$ to be shattered, the two constraints above must hold true for *every possible* labeling of $S$. This means they must hold for all possible values of $k$, where $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$. We need to find the conditions on $d$ that satisfy this.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints in their most restrictive forms:\n\n1.  **From Constraint 1 ($k \\le z$):** This inequality must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d\\}$. The most restrictive case is when $k$ is at its maximum, i.e., $k=d$. This corresponds to the labeling where all points in $S$ are '1'. For this labeling to be possible, we must have $d \\le z$.\n\n2.  **From Constraint 2 ($z-k \\le T-d$):** This inequality must also hold for all $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d\\}$. This inequality is equivalent to $d-k \\le T-z$. The left side, $d-k$, is the number of zeros in the labeling. To find the most restrictive case, we need to maximize $d-k$. This occurs when $k$ is at its minimum, i.e., $k=0$. This corresponds to the labeling where all points in $S$ are '0'. For this labeling to be possible, we must have $d-0 \\le T-z$, which simplifies to $d \\le T-z$.\n\nFor a set of size $d$ to be shattered, both derived conditions must be met simultaneously:\n*   $d \\le z$\n*   $d \\le T-z$\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that $d$ must be less than or equal to both $z$ and $T-z$. Therefore, the maximum possible value for $d$ is the smaller of these two quantities.\n$d \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nThis proves that the VC dimension cannot be larger than $\\min(z, T-z)$. So, VC-dim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### 4. Proving that a Set of this Size Can Be Shattered\n\nNow we need to show that we can actually shatter a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$. Let's pick any set $S$ with $|S|=d$.\nConsider any labeling of $S$ with $k$ ones (where $0 \\le k \\le d$). We just need to show that this labeling can always be realized by some $h \\in H_{z-ones}$.\nWe need to check if our two conditions hold:\n1.  Is $k \\le z$? Since $k \\le d$ and we know $d = \\min(z, T-z)$, it follows that $d \\le z$. Thus, $k \\le d \\le z$. The condition holds.\n2.  Is $z-k \\le T-d$? This is equivalent to $d-k \\le T-z$. The maximum value of the left side is when $k=0$, which gives $d$. So we need to check if $d \\le T-z$. Since $d = \\min(z, T-z)$, it follows that $d \\le T-z$. The condition holds.\n\nSince both conditions hold for any $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d\\}$, we can always find the required $z-k$ points in $X \\setminus S$ to complete our hypothesis. Therefore, any set of size $d=\\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\nThis proves that VC-dim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\ge \\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### 5. Final Conclusion\n\nFrom the two parts of the analysis, we have:\n*   VC-dim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n*   VC-dim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\ge \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nCombining these results, the VC dimension must be exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\nNote: This analysis assumes $1 \\le z < T$. If $z=T$ or $z=0$, the class $H$ contains only one function (all ones or all zeros), so its VC dimension is 0. Our formula gives $\\min(T, T-T)=0$ and $\\min(0, T-0)=0$, so it holds in these edge cases as well.\n\nThe final answer is the largest size $d$ for which a set can be shattered.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
