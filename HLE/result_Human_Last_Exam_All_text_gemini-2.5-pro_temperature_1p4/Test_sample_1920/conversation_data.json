    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$.**\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nWe can test for divisibility by small primes:\n$53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n$7657 \\div 13 = 589$\n$589 \\div 19 = 31$\n31 is a prime number.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThis is a square-free integer, which simplifies the analysis. Let's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet character.**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ can be uniquely written as a product of Dirichlet characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$\nwhere $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the condition of primitivity.**\nA character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $d$ if $d$ is the smallest modulus for which the character is defined. For a character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$ where the moduli $p_i^{a_i}$ are pairwise coprime, the conductor is the product of the conductors of the component characters:\n$\\text{cond}(\\chi) = \\text{cond}(\\chi_1) \\text{cond}(\\chi_2) \\text{cond}(\\chi_3) \\text{cond}(\\chi_4)$.\nWe are given that $\\chi$ is primitive of conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$. Thus, we must have:\n$\\text{cond}(\\chi_1) \\text{cond}(\\chi_2) \\text{cond}(\\chi_3) \\text{cond}(\\chi_4) = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$.\nThe conductor of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$ is either 1 (if $\\chi_i$ is the principal character) or $p_i$ (if $\\chi_i$ is non-principal). To satisfy the equation above, each component character $\\chi_i$ must have conductor $p_i$. This means each $\\chi_i$ must be a non-principal character. A non-principal character has an order greater than 1.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** For a square-free conductor $d$, a character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if all its component characters $\\chi_i$ are non-principal.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the condition on the order.**\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6. So, we need:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nLet $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. The condition implies that each $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Combined with the primitivity condition ($o_i > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of possible component characters.**\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. For any integer $k$ that divides $p-1$, there are exactly $\\phi(k)$ characters of order $k$.\n\nLet's check the values of $p_i-1$ for our primes:\n*   $p_1-1 = 7-1 = 6$\n*   $p_2-1 = 13-1 = 12$\n*   $p_3-1 = 19-1 = 18$\n*   $p_4-1 = 31-1 = 30$\n\nIn all four cases, the orders we are interested in ({2, 3, 6}) are divisors of $p_i-1$. Therefore, for each prime factor $p_i$, we can calculate the number of characters for each possible order:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $N_2 = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $N_3 = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $N_6 = \\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Verify that the required orders are valid for all component character groups. Since 6 divides $p_i-1$ for all $i=1,2,3,4$, this condition is satisfied.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the counts using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.**\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ has order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and their lcm is exactly 6.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all 4-tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal character whose order divides 6.\nFor each component $i$, the number of available characters is $N_2 + N_3 + N_6 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are 4 components, the total number of such tuples is $|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract the tuples where the lcm is not 6. The lcm of numbers from $\\{2,3,6\\}$ is not 6 if it lacks a factor of 2 or a factor of 3.\n*   **Case A: The lcm is not divisible by 2.** This means all orders $o_i$ must be odd. From the set $\\{2,3,6\\}$, this forces all $o_i=3$.\n    *   For each component, there are $N_3=2$ choices.\n    *   Number of such tuples = $2^4 = 16$.\n*   **Case B: The lcm is not divisible by 3.** This means no order $o_i$ is divisible by 3. From the set $\\{2,3,6\\}$, this forces all $o_i=2$.\n    *   For each component, there is $N_2=1$ choice.\n    *   Number of such tuples = $1^4 = 1$.\n\nThe set of tuples in Case A (all orders are 3) and the set of tuples in Case B (all orders are 2) are disjoint.\nThe total number of \"bad\" tuples (where the lcm is not 6) is the sum of the counts from these two cases: $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nThe number of desired characters is the total number of tuples in $S$ minus the number of \"bad\" tuples:\nNumber of characters = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The use of the inclusion-exclusion principle is the correct method for this combinatorial counting problem. The total set is those where the lcm divides 6. We subtract the sets where the lcm divides a maximal proper divisor of 6 (which are 2 and 3).\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nTotal combinations where orders $o_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$: $5^4 = 625$.\nSubtract combinations where orders $o_i \\in \\{3\\}$: $2^4 = 16$.\nSubtract combinations where orders $o_i \\in \\{2\\}$: $1^4 = 1$.\nFinal count: $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
