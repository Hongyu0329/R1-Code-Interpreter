    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function\nThe grand canonical partition function, Z, for a quantum system is defined by the trace of the density operator in the grand canonical ensemble:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu\\hat{N})})$\nwhere:\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse thermal energy, with T being the temperature and $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant.\n*   Tr denotes the trace over a complete set of states in the Fock space (which includes states with all possible particle numbers).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute the Given Hamiltonian\nThe problem specifies a particular Hamiltonian: $\\hat{H} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$.\nWe substitute this into the general formula for Z. The operator in the exponent, often called the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K}$, is:\n$\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu\\hat{N} = (-\\mu\\hat{N}) - \\mu\\hat{N} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$\nTherefore, the partition function becomes:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu\\hat{N})}) = \\text{Tr}(e^{2\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}})$\n\n### Step 3: Use the Path Integral Framework and Second Quantization\nThe question asks to use the path integral formalism. In this framework, the system is described by quantum fields, and the total number operator $\\hat{N}$ is expressed as a sum over the number operators $\\hat{n}_i$ for each single-particle quantum state (or mode) 'i':\n$\\hat{N} = \\sum_i \\hat{n}_i$\nSince the number operators for different modes commute, $[\\hat{n}_i, \\hat{n}_j] = 0$, the exponential of the sum can be written as a product of exponentials:\n$e^{2\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}} = e^{2\\beta\\mu \\sum_i \\hat{n}_i} = \\prod_i e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{n}_i}$\nThe path integral for the partition function involves an action that is a sum over the actions for each uncoupled mode. This leads to the partition function being a product of the partition functions for each individual mode.\nThe trace of this product of operators separates into a product of traces for each mode:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(\\prod_i e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{n}_i}) = \\prod_i \\text{Tr}_i(e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{n}_i})$\nLet's define the partition function for a single mode 'i' as $Z_i$:\n$Z_i = \\text{Tr}_i(e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{n}_i})$\nThe total partition function is then $Z = \\prod_i Z_i$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Single-Mode Partition Function ($Z_i$)\nThe value of the trace for a single mode depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions, as this determines the possible eigenvalues of the number operator $\\hat{n}_i$.\n\n**Case A: The particles are bosons.**\nFor bosons, the occupation number $n_i$ of a single state can be any non-negative integer: $n_i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.\nThe trace is the sum over all possible occupation numbers:\n$Z_{i, \\text{Boson}} = \\sum_{n_i=0}^{\\infty} \\langle n_i | e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{n}_i} | n_i \\rangle = \\sum_{n_i=0}^{\\infty} e^{2\\beta\\mu n_i}$\nThis is a geometric series with common ratio $x = e^{2\\beta\\mu}$. The sum converges to $1/(1-x)$ if $|x|<1$, which requires $2\\beta\\mu < 0$, or $\\mu < 0$. Assuming this condition holds:\n$Z_{i, \\text{Boson}} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\n**Case B: The particles are fermions.**\nFor fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle restricts the occupation number of a single state to either 0 or 1: $n_i = 0, 1$.\nThe trace is a finite sum over these two possibilities:\n$Z_{i, \\text{Fermion}} = \\sum_{n_i=0}^{1} e^{2\\beta\\mu n_i} = e^{2\\beta\\mu \\cdot 0} + e^{2\\beta\\mu \\cdot 1} = 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Total Partition Function\nThe total partition function is the product of the single-mode partition functions over all available single-particle states. The given Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$ implies that the single-particle energy is $\\epsilon_i = -\\mu$ for all states. Therefore, all single-particle states are degenerate, and their contributions to the partition function are identical. If we denote the total number of available single-particle states (modes) by M, we have:\n\nFor a system of **bosons**:\n$Z_{\\text{Boson}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{M} Z_{i, \\text{Boson}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}} \\right)^M = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n\nFor a system of **fermions**:\n$Z_{\\text{Fermion}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{M} Z_{i, \\text{Fermion}} = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\nThese two results can be written in a compact form:\n$Z = (1 \\mp e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{\\mp M}$\nwhere the upper sign ($-$) corresponds to bosons and the lower sign ($+$) corresponds to fermions.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Operator**: The most crucial step is to correctly identify the operator inside the partition function's trace, which is $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$, not the original Hamiltonian.\n2.  **Path Integral Interpretation**: The use of path integrals justifies treating the system as a collection of independent modes, allowing the partition function to be factorized. The evaluation of each single-mode partition function via a trace is equivalent to evaluating its 0-dimensional path integral.\n3.  **Particle Statistics**: The final expression depends on the statistics of the particles (bosons or fermions), which dictates the allowed occupation numbers.\n4.  **Number of Modes (M)**: The answer also depends on M, the total number of available single-particle states, which is not specified in the question. The answer must therefore be expressed in terms of M.\n5.  **Convergence Condition**: For the bosonic case, the result is valid only if the chemical potential $\\mu$ is negative to ensure the convergence of the geometric series.\n\nSince the question is ambiguous regarding the particle type and the number of modes, the most complete and general answer includes both possibilities.\n\n<<<$(1 \\mp e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{\\mp M}$, where the upper sign is for bosons, the lower sign is for fermions, and M is the number of single-particle states.>>>"
