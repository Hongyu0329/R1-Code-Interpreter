After a measurement on one of the ququints (e.g., ququint A) in the computational basis `{|0>, |1>, |2>, |3>, |4>}`, the initial entangled state collapses. The final state of the two-ququint system will be one of the five separable states $|k\rangle_A \otimes |k\rangle_B$ (for k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Each of these five possible outcomes occurs with an equal probability of 1/5.
