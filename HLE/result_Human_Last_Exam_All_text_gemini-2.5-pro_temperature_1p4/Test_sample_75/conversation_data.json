    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Event:** The question asks for the duration of the \"Second Great War\". In StarCraft lore, this term refers to the major galactic conflict that encompasses the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy: *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date:** The Second Great War officially begins with the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, which marks the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date:** The war concludes with the final defeat of the primary antagonist, the dark god Amon, by the combined forces of the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss. This final battle and its immediate aftermath are depicted in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void\". These events take place in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Span of Time:**\n    *   The war starts in **2504**.\n    *   The war ends in **2506**.\n    *   This means the conflict was active during parts of three separate calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n        *   *Wings of Liberty* and the beginning of *Heart of the Swarm* take place in 2504.\n        *   The latter part of *Heart of the Swarm* occurs in 2505.\n        *   *Legacy of the Void* and its epilogue take place in 2506.\n    *   Therefore, the total duration is greater than 2 full years but not a full 3 years (e.g., from sometime in 2504 to sometime in 2506 is approximately 2.x years).\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:** The question specifically asks for the duration to be **rounded up** to the nearest whole number. Since the war's duration is greater than 2 years (e.g., ~2.5 years), rounding it up to the next whole number results in 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"War\":** The start and end points are defined by major campaign events, not necessarily by a formal declaration and treaty. The timeline is based on the narrative flow of the *StarCraft II* games.\n*   **Exact Dates:** While the specific month and day are not always provided, the lore is consistent about the years in which the campaigns take place. The conflict spanning from 2504 to 2506 is the accepted timeframe.\n*   **\"Rounded Up\":** This is a key instruction. A simple subtraction (2506 - 2504 = 2) would be inaccurate because it doesn't account for the time spanning the years and, more importantly, ignores the \"round up\" requirement. Any duration over 2.0 years must be rounded up to 3.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the Second Great War started in 2504 and ended in 2506, spanning parts of three years. This gives it a duration of over two years. Rounding this duration up to the nearest whole year yields 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
