The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:
$Z = \int \mathcal{D}[\psi^*, \psi] \, e^{-S[\psi^*, \psi]}$
where:
*   $\mathcal{D}[\psi^*, \psi]$ is the functional integration measure over all independent Grassmann-valued fields $\psi(\tau)$ and $\psi^*(\tau)$.
*   $S[\psi^*, \psi]$ is the Euclidean action, defined as:
    $S[\psi^*, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \sum_i \psi_i^*(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi_i(\tau) + H(\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]$
*   $\psi_i(\tau)$ and $\psi_i^*(\tau)$ are Grassmann fields corresponding to the annihilation and creation operators, respectively. The index $i$ labels all quantum numbers (e.g., position, momentum, spin).
*   $H(\psi^*, \psi)$ is the normal-ordered Hamiltonian of the system (potentially including a chemical potential term, $H \rightarrow H - \mu N$), where creation and annihilation operators have been replaced by their corresponding Grassmann fields.
*   The integral is performed over all fields that satisfy the crucial **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in imaginary time $\tau$:
    $\psi_i(\beta) = -\psi_i(0)$
    $\psi_i^*(\beta) = -\psi_i^*(0)$
where $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.
