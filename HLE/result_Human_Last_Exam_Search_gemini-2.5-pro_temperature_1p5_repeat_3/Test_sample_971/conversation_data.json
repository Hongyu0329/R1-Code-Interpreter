    "I am unable to provide a specific number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008.\n\nWhile it is documented that Natalia Osipova performed the role of Kitri in *Don Quixote* in 2008, including guest performances, detailed choreographic counts of specific performances are not readily available in written sources. Reviews from that time praise her technical abilities, particularly her jumps and turns, but do not provide a numerical breakdown of her pirouettes.\n\nTo determine the exact number of pirouettes would require a visual analysis of a video recording of the specific 2008 Bolshoi Ballet performance, which is beyond my current capabilities. There are several online videos purporting to be from her 2008 performances, but their authenticity and the consistency of choreography between performances can be difficult to verify without expert analysis.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
