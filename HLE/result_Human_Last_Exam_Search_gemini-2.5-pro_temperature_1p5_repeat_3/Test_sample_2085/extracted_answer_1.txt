There is no direct French equivalent for "Odobeccus". The name is composed of the Gaulish elements "Odo-", likely meaning "wealth" or "prosperity" from a Germanic root, and "-beccus", which means "beak" and corresponds to the French word "bec". A conceptual translation would be along the lines of "Bec-Riche" (Rich-Beak) or "Bec-Prosp√®re" (Prosperous-Beak).
