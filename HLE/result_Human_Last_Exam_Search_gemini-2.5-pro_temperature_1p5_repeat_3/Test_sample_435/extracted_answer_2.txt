Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a potent but potentially more controlled initial cytokine release compared to those manufactured with IL-2, due to the generation of a less differentiated and more persistent phenotype. However, "armored" CAR T cells engineered to secrete their own IL-15 are predicted to have a higher propensity for robust and sustained cytokine release, leading to an increased risk of Cytokine Release Syndrome.
