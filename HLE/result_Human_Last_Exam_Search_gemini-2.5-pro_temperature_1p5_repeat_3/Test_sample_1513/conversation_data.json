    "The island town that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera sharing the town's name, and is located more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n\nEaster Island, a special territory of Chile, is one of the most isolated inhabited islands in the world. Its nearest inhabited neighbor, Pitcairn Island, is approximately 1,931 kilometers (1,200 miles) to the west.\n\nThe island's capital and main settlement is Hanga Roa. The town is situated on the island's west coast in a lowland area nestled between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau. Rano Kau features a distinct and large volcanic caldera.\n\nThe town of Hanga Roa is located on a bay of the same name, Hanga Roa Bay. In the native Rapa Nui language, \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"wide bay\" or \"long bay\".\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
