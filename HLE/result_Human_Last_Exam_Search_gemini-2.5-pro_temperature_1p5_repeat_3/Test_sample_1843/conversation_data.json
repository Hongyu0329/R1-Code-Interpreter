    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization of N**:\n    First, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n2.  **Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters**:\n    A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive with conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$:\n    $\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\n    where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character modulo $p^a$.\n\n3.  **Order of a Product Character**:\n    The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    Order$(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{Order}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{Order}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{Order}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{Order}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{Order}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n    We are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number and Orders of Primitive Characters for each Prime Power Factor**:\n    We need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power in the factorization of $N$ and their possible orders.\n\n    *   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There are $\\phi(4)=2$ characters in total. One is the principal character (order 1, conductor 1). The other character is primitive of conductor 4 and has order 2. Let's denote the number of primitive characters of order $k$ as $C(p^a, k)$. So, $C(4, 2) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character modulo $p^a$ ($p$ is an odd prime, $a \\geq 2$) is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(p^{a-1})$. For $p=3, a=2$, a character is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. The possible orders for characters mod 9 are the divisors of 6, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 6. The orders of primitive characters are therefore 3 and 6.\n        *   $C(9, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n        *   $C(9, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n    *   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if it is not the principal character. The possible orders are the divisors of $\\phi(7)=6$, excluding 1.\n        *   $C(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n        *   $C(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n        *   $C(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n    *   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. Primitive characters have orders that are divisors of $\\phi(11)=10$, excluding 1.\n        *   $C(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n        *   $C(11, 5) = \\phi(5) = 4$.\n        *   $C(11, 10) = \\phi(10) = 4$.\n\n    *   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. Primitive characters have orders that are divisors of $\\phi(13)=12$, excluding 1.\n        *   $C(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n        *   $C(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n        *   $C(13, 4) = \\phi(4) = 2$.\n        *   $C(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n        *   $C(13, 12) = \\phi(12) = 4$.\n\n5.  **Count the Number of Combinations**:\n    We need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6.\n    Let $k_n$ be the order of the character $\\chi_n$. For the lcm to be 6, each $k_n$ must be a divisor of 6.\n\n    *   **Choices for $\\chi_4$**: $k_4$ must divide 6. The only possible order is 2. Number of choices = $C(4, 2) = 1$.\n    *   **Choices for $\\chi_9$**: $k_9$ must divide 6. Possible orders are 3 and 6. Number of choices = $C(9, 3) + C(9, 6) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n    *   **Choices for $\\chi_7$**: $k_7$ must divide 6. Possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. Number of choices = $C(7, 2) + C(7, 3) + C(7, 6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    *   **Choices for $\\chi_{11}$**: $k_{11}$ must divide 6. The only possible order is 2. Number of choices = $C(11, 2) = 1$.\n    *   **Choices for $\\chi_{13}$**: $k_{13}$ must divide 6. Possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. Number of choices = $C(13, 2) + C(13, 3) + C(13, 6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n    The total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ with order dividing 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\n    Total choices = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n    Now we must verify that the order is exactly 6. The order is 6 if:\n    1.  The order of each component character divides 6 (which we have already ensured).\n    2.  The lcm of the orders is a multiple of 2.\n    3.  The lcm of the orders is a multiple of 3.\n\n    The order of $\\chi_4$ is always 2, so the lcm will always be a multiple of 2.\n    The order of $\\chi_9$ can be 3 or 6, both of which are multiples of 3. Thus, the lcm of the orders will always be a multiple of 3.\n\n    Since the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. As all component orders divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6. Therefore, the order is exactly 6 for any combination of the selected characters.\n\n    The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the total number of combinations we found.\n\n    Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
