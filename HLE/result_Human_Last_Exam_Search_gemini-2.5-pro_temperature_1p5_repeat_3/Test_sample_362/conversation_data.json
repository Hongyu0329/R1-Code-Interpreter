    "### Product of Wittig Reaction Identified as a Mix of Alkene Stereoisomers\n\nThe Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane results in the formation of **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The reaction's stereochemistry is influenced by the nature of the reactants, likely producing a mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers, with a probable preference for the (E)-alkene due to steric hindrance.\n\nThe reaction involves an aldehyde, pivalaldehyde ((CH₃)₃C-CHO), and a phosphorus ylide. The ylide's name, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, indicates a triphenylphosphine group attached to an ethylidene (`=CHCH₃`) unit, which is substituted on the second carbon with a 2-chlorophenyl group. This corresponds to the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(2-Cl-C₆H₄).\n\nThe Wittig reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the ylide on the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. This process typically proceeds through a four-membered ring intermediate known as an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to form a stable triphenylphosphine oxide and the desired alkene.\n\nThe stereochemical outcome of the Wittig reaction depends significantly on the structure of the ylide. Ylides are generally categorized as stabilized or non-stabilized.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides**, typically those with alkyl or hydrogen substituents, are more reactive and generally yield (Z)-alkenes (cis isomers).\n*   **Stabilized ylides**, which have electron-withdrawing groups that can delocalize the negative charge, are less reactive and predominantly form (E)-alkenes (trans isomers).\n\nThe ylide in question, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(2-Cl-C₆H₄), is classified as non-stabilized because the methylene (-CH₂-) group insulates the electron-rich carbon from the phenyl ring, preventing resonance stabilization. While non-stabilized ylides typically favor the (Z)-alkene, this tendency can be altered by steric hindrance. Both pivalaldehyde, with its bulky tert-butyl group, and the ylide, with its substituted benzyl group, are sterically demanding. In cases involving bulky aldehydes and ylides, the formation of the more sterically favored (E)-alkene is often preferred to minimize steric interactions in the transition state. Therefore, while (Z)-alkene formation is characteristic of non-stabilized ylides, the significant steric bulk of the reactants in this specific case makes the formation of the (E)-isomer, **(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**, a highly probable major product.\n\n<<<**(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene and (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
