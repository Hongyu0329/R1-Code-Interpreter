    "The man in question is Nikolai Rezanov. The poem by Andrei Voznesensky that mentions \"a joy-discovering sailor\" is part of the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\". This opera is based on the tragic love story of Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov and María Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish governor of Alta California.\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807. His original grave was destroyed. In the late 20th century, his remains were reburied, and on October 28, 2000, a memorial was dedicated at his grave in the Trinity churchyard of Krasnoyarsk. There have been symbolic ceremonies to reunite the two lovers, with earth from Rezanov's grave being brought to Concepción's grave in Benicia, California, and a rose from her burial site taken to his.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
