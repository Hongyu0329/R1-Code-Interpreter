    "The initial search has provided a good overview of Christian theological discussions on miracles, natural law, the virgin birth, and the Fall. It highlights key figures like Thomas Aquinas, C.S. Lewis, and various modern philosophers of religion who have debated whether miracles are violations of natural law. The results also touch on how the Fall is understood to have affected humanity and the natural world, particularly within Reformed theology. However, the initial search did not specifically identify a single theologian who developed a specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature applicable to *both* the virgin birth and the Fall. The term \"miracle\" is general, and while concepts like God's sovereignty over natural laws are discussed, a specific, developed terminology by one theologian linking these two events is not yet apparent. Therefore, the next step needs to focus on finding this specific terminology and the theologian responsible for it.The searches have provided a wealth of information regarding theological discussions on natural law, miracles, the virgin birth, and the Fall. Key figures like Augustine and Aquinas are highlighted as foundational in their understanding of miracles in relation to natural law. The search also brought up modern theologians like Karl Barth and Karl Rahner who have delved into the theological significance of these doctrines. Specifically, the search results hint at a distinction between the \"virginal conception\" and the \"virginal birth,\" with the latter sometimes being described with terms like \"incorruptibiliter genuisse\" (brought forth without corruption). There's also mention of how the virgin birth is seen as preventing the transmission of original sin, which is a direct consequence of the Fall. However, a single theologian who developed a *specialized and comprehensive terminology* to describe changes in the laws of nature for *both* the virgin birth and the Fall has not been explicitly identified. The pieces of the puzzle seem to be there, but they need to be connected. For instance, the concept of \"incorruption\" in the context of the virgin birth could potentially be linked to the \"corruption\" of nature after the Fall. I need to investigate further if a specific theologian systematically developed this terminological link.The research has strongly pointed towards Augustine of Hippo. The search results from step 3, particularly those referencing his works like \"Enchiridion\" and \"City of God,\" reveal his extensive development of the concepts of \"corruption\" and \"incorruption.\" He applies \"corruption\" to the state of human nature after the Fall, explaining it as a privation of the good and a vitiated state passed down through generations. Conversely, he discusses the \"incorruptible\" nature, and the concept is linked to the virgin birth of Jesus, specifically how the Holy Spirit enabled an \"immaculate birth\" free from the \"corruption\" of original sin.  For example, one search result states, \"Only Jesus 'alone of those who are born of a woman is holyâ€¦by reason of the novelty of His immaculate birth', whereby the Holy Spirit 'infused immaculate seed into [Mary's] unviolated womb'.\" This directly connects a specialized understanding of the virgin birth to the problem of the Fall's corruption. Furthermore, the term \"natura incorruptibilis\" (incorruptible nature) is found in his writings. While other theologians like Aquinas built upon these ideas, Augustine appears to be the originator of this specific terminological framework that contrasts the state of humanity after the Fall with the unique circumstances of Christ's birth.  I believe I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nAugustine of Hippo was the first Christian theologian to develop a specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall. He elaborately contrasted the \"corruption\" of human nature resulting from the Fall with the \"incorruptible\" nature of Christ's flesh, made possible through the virgin birth.\n\nAugustine argued that as a consequence of the Fall of Adam, human nature became \"vitiated and altered,\" subject to the \"corruption\" of sin and death, a condition passed down through natural generation. In his theological framework, this inherited corruption is a privation of the original good with which humanity was created.\n\nIn contrast, Augustine described the birth of Jesus as a unique event that circumvented this law of inherited corruption. He maintained that through the miraculous intervention of the Holy Spirit, Christ was born of a virgin, and his flesh was therefore not subject to the same corruption. Augustine used terms like \"immaculate birth\" to describe this event, whereby the normal course of nature, which transmitted sin, was altered. The key concept here is that the virgin birth was not merely a miracle but a necessary means to ensure Christ's freedom from the \"corruption\" that universally affects humanity after the Fall. He referred to an incorruptible entity as a \"natura incorruptibilis.\"\n\nWhile later theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas, further systematized the understanding of natural law and miracles, Augustine was the first to establish this specific terminological and conceptual linkage between the corruption of nature at the Fall and the incorruptible nature of Christ's humanity as a direct result of the virgin birth.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
