    "To solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method, a minimum of five non-top-facing stickers must be seen to fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case.\n\nThe last stage of the CFOP method involves two steps: Orienting the Last Layer (OLL), where the top face is made a solid color, and Permuting the Last Layer (PLL), where the remaining pieces are moved to their correct positions. To identify which of the 21 possible PLL cases you have, you must observe the side-facing stickers of the last layer's edge and corner pieces.\n\nWhile it is common for solvers to look at two adjacent faces to recognize the case, which involves observing six stickers, this is not the minimum required. Advanced techniques demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between all PLL cases by observing only five specific stickers. A common five-sticker recognition set includes the side stickers of three specific corners and two specific edges. For example, one such set is the stickers on the UFL, UF, UFR, UR, and UBR pieces (Front-Left, Front, Front-Right, Right, and Back-Right pieces of the top layer).\n\nMethods that rely on recognizing patterns like \"headlights\" (two corners with the same color on a side) or solved blocks often require looking at multiple sides of the cube to gather enough information. However, a systematic approach focusing on a specific set of five stickers is sufficient to uniquely determine the permutation of the last layer pieces.\n\n<<<5>>>"
