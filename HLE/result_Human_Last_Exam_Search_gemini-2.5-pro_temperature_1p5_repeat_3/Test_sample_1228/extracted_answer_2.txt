No, a net asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos cannot be induced under these conditions. While CP violation in the decay of K_L mesons does create a preference for producing neutrinos over antineutrinos, the principle of CPT invariance dictates that the lepton asymmetry generated from an initial population of K⁰ mesons is exactly cancelled by an opposite asymmetry from an equal initial population of anti-K⁰ mesons. Since the hypothetical particle decays into kaons and antikaons equally, no net asymmetry would arise.
