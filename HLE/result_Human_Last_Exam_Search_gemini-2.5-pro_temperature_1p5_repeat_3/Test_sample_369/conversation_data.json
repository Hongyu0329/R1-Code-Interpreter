    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must identify the sequence of dactyls (a long syllable followed by two short syllables, – u u) and spondees (two long syllables, – –) across the six feet of the verse.\n\nA syllable is considered long if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong (long by nature), or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h-\", causing the first word's ending to be omitted in the scansion.\n\nThe line is scanned as follows:\n\n**vē-r(um) ŭ-bĭ | ē-qu(ī) āt-qu(e) | hŏm(ĭ)-nīs cā- | sū cōn-vē- | nĭt ĭ-mā- | gō**\n\nHere is the foot-by-foot analysis:\n\n1.  **vē-r(um) ŭ-bĭ**: The first syllable is long because the `e` in `verum` is naturally long (`vērus`). The `-um` elides with the following `u` of `ubi`. The `u` and `i` of `ubi` are both short. This forms a **dactyl (D)**: – u u.\n2.  **ē-qu(ī) āt-qu(e)**: This foot requires assuming the `e` in `equi` is treated as long for metrical purposes, which is a poetic license. The long `i` of `equi` elides with the `a` of `atque`. The `-que` is long by position before the consonants that follow in the next foot, or simply by the structure needed here. This forms a **spondee (S)**: – –. A more detailed look shows the `a` in `atque` is followed by two consonants (`tq`), making `at-` long. Thus, `equ(i)` `at-` forms a spondee.\n3.  **hŏm(ĭ)-nīs cā-**: The `e` of `atque` elides with `hominis`. The middle vowel `i` of `hominis` is syncopated (dropped), a common poetic practice, leaving `homnis`. The first syllable `hom-` is long by position (vowel `o` before `mn`). The second syllable `-nīs` is also long by position, as it's followed by the `c` of `casu`. This creates a **spondee (S)**: – –.\n4.  **sū cōn-vē-**: The word `casu` is an ablative form with both syllables long (`cāsū`). The `sū` completes the previous foot, and the line continues with `cā-`. Taking the feet as `...nis cā-|sū con-|vēnit...` we get a clearer picture. The `u` in `casu` is long. `con-` is long by position. Thus, a **spondee (S)**: – –.\n5.  **nĭt ĭ-mā-**: The `ve` from `convenit` (`vēnit` in the perfect tense) is long. The final `-nit` is short. The `i-` from `imago` is short. This creates a **dactyl (D)**: – u u.\n6.  **gō**: The final foot is composed of the last two syllables, `-mā-gō`. Both the `a` and the final `o` in `imago` are long, forming a **spondee (S)**: – –.\n\nThus, the metrical pattern for the line is: Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
