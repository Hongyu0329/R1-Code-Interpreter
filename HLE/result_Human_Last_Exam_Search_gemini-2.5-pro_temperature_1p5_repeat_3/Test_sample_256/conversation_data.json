    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C1. This information is based on the comprehensive data table of \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" provided by Eckard Specht. In this resource, the symmetry of the packing is given in Schoenflies notation, and for N=1135, the entry for the symmetry group is empty, which, according to the table's legend, indicates a C1 symmetry.\n\n<<<C1>>>"
