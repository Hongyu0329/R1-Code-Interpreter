    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action, denoted as `a₂`, for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in four dimensions is a crucial element in understanding the quantum effects of the theory. The spectral action is expressed as the trace of a function of the square of the Dirac operator, `Tr(f(D²))`. Its asymptotic expansion for a large cutoff scale Λ is given by `∑ cₙ aₙ`, where the `aₙ` are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients.\n\nThe Dirac operator for a massless gauged spinor field is given by `D = iγ^μ(∂_μ + ω_μ + iA_μ)`, where `γ^μ` are the gamma matrices, `ω_μ` is the spin connection, and `A_μ` is the gauge field connection. The square of this operator can be written in the generic form `- (∇² + E)`, where `∇` is the covariant derivative acting on spinors and `E` is an endomorphism given by:\n\n`E = (1/4)R - (i/4)F_{μν}γ^μγ^ν`\n\nHere, `R` is the scalar curvature and `F_{μν}` is the field strength of the gauge field.\n\nThe second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, `a₂`, is a local invariant constructed from the curvature and the gauge field strength. For an operator of the form `- (∇² + E)`, the general formula for `a₂` in four dimensions is given by:\n\n`a₂ = ∫ d⁴x √g (1/(360π²)) tr[ (60E² + 30Ω_{μν}Ω^{μν} + 180E_{;μ}^{;μ} + (5R² - 2R_{μν}R^{μν} + 2R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ})I) ]`\n\nwhere `Ω_{μν} = [∇_μ, ∇_ν]` is the total curvature including the Riemann and gauge parts, and the trace is taken over the spinor and gauge group indices.\n\nFor the specific case of a massless gauged Dirac spinor, the relevant terms contributing to `a₂` simplify significantly. After performing the trace over the spinor indices, the second coefficient is found to be:\n\n`a₂ = ∫ d⁴x √g (1/(24π²)) tr[ (1/2)F_{μν}F^{μν} - (1/3)R R - (7/30)R_{μν}R^{μν} + (1/30)R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} ]`\n\n<<<a₂ = ∫ d⁴x √g (1/(24π²)) tr[ (1/2)F_{μν}F^{μν} - (1/3)R R - (7/30)R_{μν}R^{μν} + (1/30)R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} ]>>>"
