In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the asymptotic analysis of the generating function H(s,s′) that encapsulates the billiard map's symplectic structure, in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero, can be characterized. The generating function is the negative of the Euclidean distance between two points on the boundary, γ(s) and γ(s′). Through a Taylor expansion of the boundary curve's parametrization that incorporates the local curvature κ(s) via the Frenet-Serret formulas, the leading-order behavior of H(s,s′) is found to be:

`H(s, s') = -|s' - s| + (κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³ + O(|s' - s|⁴)`

The leading term, `-|s' - s|`, represents the simple approximation of the chord length by the arc length, devoid of any geometric influence. The nuanced interplay between the boundary's geometry and the system's dynamics is revealed in the first correction term, `(κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³`. This term demonstrates that the deviation from the linear approximation is proportional to the square of the local curvature and the cube of the separation distance. This shows that in regions of higher curvature, the chord length is shorter relative to the arc length, a geometric fact that has profound implications for the dynamics of trajectories near the boundary, influencing their stability and the formation of caustics.
