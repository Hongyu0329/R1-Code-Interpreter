    "Based on the provided information, it is inferred that the question relates to the invariants of a quadratic number field $k = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ where $N$ is a squarefree natural number greater than 1. For such numbers, the field $k$ is a real quadratic field.\n\nThe key terms are interpreted as follows:\n*   **Squarefree natural number $(N)$**: An integer $N > 1$ that is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1.\n*   **Covolume $(V)$**: This is interpreted as the covolume of the ring of integers $O_k$ embedded as a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This covolume is given by the square root of the absolute value of the discriminant of the field, so $V = \\sqrt{D_k}$. The discriminant $D_k$ is equal to $N$ if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and $4N$ if $N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod 4$.\n*   **Maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$**: This non-standard notation is interpreted as the Minkowski bound, $M_k$. This bound provides an upper limit on the norm of an integral ideal that can be found in any ideal class. In a sense, it is the \"maximum\" norm one needs to check to find representatives for all ideal classes. The subscript $\\infty$ likely alludes to the use of geometry of numbers in the Archimedean space $k \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWith these interpretations, the relationship between the Minkowski bound and the covolume of the integer lattice can be established. The general formula for the Minkowski bound for a number field of degree $n$ with $r_2$ complex embeddings is:\n$M_k = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\sqrt{|D_k|}$.\n\nFor a real quadratic field $k = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$:\n*   The degree is $n=2$.\n*   There are $r_1=2$ real embeddings and $r_2=0$ complex embeddings.\n*   The discriminant is $D_k > 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$M_k = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^0 \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{D_k} = \\frac{2}{4} \\sqrt{D_k} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{D_k}$.\n\nRelating this to the interpreted covolume $V = \\sqrt{D_k}$:\n$k_{k,\\infty} = M_k = \\frac{1}{2} V$.\n\nThus, the upper bound for the norm of an ideal class representative is half the value of the covolume of the ring of integers.\n\nFor completeness, if one were to consider negative squarefree integers (for imaginary quadratic fields), where $k = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ with $N < 0$:\n*   $n=2$, $r_1=0$, $r_2=1$.\n*   The covolume of the ring of integers embedded in $\\mathbb{C} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$ is $V = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{|D_k|}$.\n*   The Minkowski bound would be $M_k = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^1 \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{|D_k|} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sqrt{|D_k|}$.\n*   The relationship would be $M_k = \\frac{2}{\\pi} (2V) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}V$.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies \"natural numbers,\" the first case (real quadratic fields) is the direct answer.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm, interpreted as the Minkowski bound ($M_k$), in relation to the covolume of the ring of integers ($V=\\sqrt{D_k}$), for a real quadratic field defined by a squarefree natural number is given by the relation $M_k = \\frac{1}{2}V$.>>>"
