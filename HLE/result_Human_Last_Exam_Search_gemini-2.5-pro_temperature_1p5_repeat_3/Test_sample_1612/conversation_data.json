    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), a \"Triple Crown\" is a prestigious and relatively rare achievement. There are two types of Triple Crowns: one for batters and one for pitchers. Including the recognized statistics from the Negro Leagues, there have been a total of **52** individual players who have won a Triple Crown.\n\nThe **batting Triple Crown** is awarded to a player who leads their league in three key offensive categories: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season. A total of **27** different players have accomplished this feat. Some notable players to have won the batting Triple Crown include Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, and most recently, Miguel Cabrera in 2012. The inclusion of Negro League statistics added players like Oscar Charleston and Josh Gibson to this esteemed list.\n\nThe **pitching Triple Crown** is achieved by a pitcher who leads their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA). This has been accomplished by **35** individual pitchers. Prominent winners of the pitching Triple Crown include Hall of Famers such as Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax, and Pedro Martinez. The recognition of Negro League records also added four more pitchers to this list.\n\nIt is important to note that while some players have won a particular Triple Crown multiple times—for instance, Oscar Charleston won the batting Triple Crown three times and Sandy Koufax won the pitching Triple Crown three times—the total number of unique winners across both categories remains distinct. There have been occasions where a batter and a pitcher won the Triple Crown in the same year, and even on the same team.\n\n<<<52>>>"
