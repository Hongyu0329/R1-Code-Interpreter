    "### Radon: Earth's Rarest Noble Gas in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was unequivocally radon (Rn). This distinction is due to its radioactive nature, resulting in extremely low and transient concentrations in the Earth's crust and atmosphere.\n\nRadon is continuously produced through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found within the Earth's crust. However, all of its isotopes are unstable, with the most stable, radon-222, having a half-life of just 3.8 days. This rapid decay ensures that its abundance remains exceptionally low.\n\nIn the Earth's crust, the concentration of radon is estimated to be a minuscule 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. Its presence in the atmosphere is even more fleeting, with an average abundance of approximately 1 x 10⁻¹⁹%.\n\nTo put radon's scarcity into perspective, a comparison with other noble gases reveals a stark contrast in abundance:\n\n*   **Xenon (Xe)**, the next rarest noble gas, is found in the atmosphere at a concentration of about 87 parts per billion by volume and in the Earth's crust at approximately 30 parts per trillion by weight.\n*   **Krypton (Kr)** is more abundant, with an atmospheric concentration of about 1.14 parts per million and a crustal abundance of around 0.15 parts per billion by weight.\n*   **Neon (Ne)** has an atmospheric concentration of about 18.2 parts per million and a crustal abundance of roughly 3 parts per billion by weight.\n*   **Helium (He)**, while relatively low in the atmosphere at about 5.2 parts per million due to its ability to escape into space, is more prevalent in the Earth's crust at about 5.5 parts per billion by weight, primarily as a product of radioactive decay.\n*   **Argon (Ar)** stands as the most plentiful noble gas on our planet, comprising a significant 0.934% of the Earth's atmosphere and having a crustal abundance of approximately 3.5 milligrams per kilogram.\n\nAlthough direct measurements of noble gas concentrations in the Earth's mantle and core are not feasible, the available data from mantle-derived rocks do not suggest a concentration of radon that would alter its status as the rarest noble gas. Given that the atmosphere and crust constitute only a fraction of the Earth's total mass, the exceedingly low concentrations of radon in these accessible portions, coupled with its inherent instability, firmly establish it as the least abundant noble gas in all of Earth's matter. The abundance levels of these gases have not seen significant changes since 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
