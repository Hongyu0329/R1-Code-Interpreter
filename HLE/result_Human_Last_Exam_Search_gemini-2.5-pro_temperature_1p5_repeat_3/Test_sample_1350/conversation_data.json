    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, there is no character who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a way that readers would recognize as a reference to Romulus and Remus.\n\nWhile the novel features a conflict between the Goths (the Wolfings) and the Romans, and a character known as the \"man of the Gael\" who was enslaved in a Roman settlement, his recollections do not contain any allusions to the Roman foundation myth. In Chapter VI, the character Hiarandi of the Elkings recounts the story of this man of the Gael, stating that he \"learned of their customs\" during his captivity. However, the narrative focuses on the harsh treatment of thralls and the social structure of the Romans rather than their religious beliefs. The text describes the Romans as a people with a ruling class that avoids labor, while a large number of slaves perform all the work. The man of the Gael's story serves to highlight the perceived injustices of Roman society in contrast to the more egalitarian culture of the Goths.\n\nThere are no other characters in the book who are described as having visited a Roman city and reported on their religious life. The primary focus of the interactions between the Goths and Romans within the narrative is their military conflict.\n\n<<<In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, no character describes the Roman religious practice of Romulus and Remus.>>>"
