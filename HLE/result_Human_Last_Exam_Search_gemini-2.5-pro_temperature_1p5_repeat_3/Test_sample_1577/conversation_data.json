    "The ground space degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. For a surface of genus *g* with *b* boundaries (holes), the ground state degeneracy (GSD) is given by the formula GSD = 2^(2g + b - 1) when there is at least one boundary, and GSD = 4^g for a closed surface with no boundaries.\n\nIn the context of the question, we are considering a plane (genus *g* = 0) with a number of holes. Each hole corresponds to a boundary. The distinction between \"smooth\" and \"rough\" holes refers to the type of boundary condition imposed at the edge of the hole.\n\n*   **Rough boundaries** (also called open or primal boundaries) are where plaquette operators are truncated. Electric charges (*e*-excitations) can terminate at a rough boundary.\n*   **Smooth boundaries** (also called closed or dual boundaries) are where star operators are truncated. Magnetic fluxes (*m*-excitations) can terminate at a smooth boundary.\n\nCreating a hole or a \"puncture\" in the toric code lattice introduces new non-trivial loops for logical operators, which increases the ground state degeneracy. Each hole, regardless of whether its boundary is smooth or rough, adds one logical qubit to the system. A logical qubit is a two-level quantum system, so adding one increases the ground state degeneracy by a factor of 2.\n\nIf we start with a plane (topologically equivalent to a sphere), which has a genus *g* = 0 and no holes, the ground state is non-degenerate (GSD = 1). When we introduce *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes, we create a total of *n + m* boundaries.\n\nEach of these *n + m* holes contributes a factor of 2 to the degeneracy. Therefore, the total ground space degeneracy is the product of the degeneracies contributed by each hole.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\nStarting with a base degeneracy of 1 (for a plane), each of the `n + m` holes doubles the degeneracy.\nTotal GSD = 1 * (2^n) * (2^m) = 2^(n+m).\n\nThis can also be seen from the general formula for a surface with genus *g* and *b* boundaries, which is GSD = 2^(2g + b -1) for b>0. For a plane, *g*=0. If we consider the plane to have an outer boundary in addition to the *n+m* holes, the total number of boundaries would be *b* = n+m+1. This would give GSD = 2^(0 + (n+m+1) - 1) = 2^(n+m). If the plane is considered infinite (no outer boundary), each hole still effectively introduces one logical qubit.\n\nThe most direct interpretation, supported by the literature, is that each hole, independent of its type, doubles the ground state space. Therefore, for *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes, the total degeneracy is 2 multiplied by itself *n + m* times.\n\n<<<A>>>"
