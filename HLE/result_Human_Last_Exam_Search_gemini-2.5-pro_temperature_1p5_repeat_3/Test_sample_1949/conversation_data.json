    "### The three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, that have real-world counterparts are the Hebrus, the Tiber, and the Eurotas.\n\nThe longest among these is the **Hebrus**, known today as the Maritsa River. It flows for approximately 480 kilometers (about 300 miles) through the Balkans, forming a significant portion of the border between Greece and Turkey. Virgil mentions the Hebrus in the Aeneid, associating it with the Thracian landscape.\n\nThe second-longest is the **Tiber**, the famous river of Rome, referred to in the Aeneid by its alternate name, Thybris. The Tiber runs for about 406 kilometers (252 miles) through Italy before emptying into the Tyrrhenian Sea. It plays a pivotal role in the narrative as Aeneas is destined to establish his new home on its banks.\n\nThe third river is the **Eurotas**, which flows through Laconia in the Peloponnese region of Greece and is associated with the ancient city-state of Sparta. Its length is approximately 82 kilometers (51 miles). Dido is compared to the goddess Diana on the banks of the Eurotas in the Aeneid.\n\nThe Aeneid also features several mythological rivers of the underworld, including the Styx, Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocytus. While some of these have been associated with real streams in Greece, such as the Acheron River which is about 52 kilometers long, their primary significance in the epic is symbolic rather than geographical. Similarly, the mythological Eridanus is mentioned but not definitively identified with a real river, though some classical authors associated it with the Po.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid with real-world counterparts are the Hebrus (Maritsa), Tiber (Thybris), and Eurotas.>>>"
