    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, which describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle, has a distinct functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship is most transparently seen in the energy-momentum representation (or frequency-wavevector representation).\n\nThe bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) is the Fourier transform of the real-space, real-time Green's function G_0(x, t). In this representation, its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k is characterized by a pole structure.\n\nSpecifically, for a system of non-interacting fermions, the time-ordered (or causal) bare Green's function is given by:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\text{sgn}(\\omega - \\mu)}$\nand the retarded bare Green's function is:\n$G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$\n\nWhere:\n*   **ω** is the frequency (the energy variable).\n*   **k** is the wavevector, which labels the single-particle eigenstates.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with wavevector k.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential.\n*   **δ** is a positive infinitesimal quantity that ensures causality by displacing the pole slightly from the real axis.\n\nFrom these expressions, we can identify the key aspects of the functional dependence:\n\n*   **Inverse Proportionality:** The bare Green's function G_0 is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\n*   **Poles at Eigenvalues:** The function has poles in the complex ω-plane located at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. The poles of the Green's function correspond to the excitation spectrum of the system. For a non-interacting system, these excitations are simply the addition or removal of a particle with energy ϵ_k.\n*   **Causality:** The small imaginary term, iδ, in the denominator is crucial. Its sign determines the analytic properties of the Green's function and ensures that the system's response is causal (i.e., the effect does not precede the cause).\n\nWhile the path integral formalism provides a powerful method for calculating the propagator by summing over all possible paths, the final expression for the bare Green's function in the energy-momentum basis reveals this fundamental relationship with the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This connection forms the foundation for developing diagrammatic perturbation theory, where G_0 acts as the fundamental building block (the propagator line in a Feynman diagram) from which the effects of interactions are calculated.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, in the energy-momentum representation, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, as an inverse function. Specifically, it takes the form G_0(k, ω) ∝ 1 / (ω - ϵ_k), where ω is the energy variable. The function exhibits poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues.>>>"
