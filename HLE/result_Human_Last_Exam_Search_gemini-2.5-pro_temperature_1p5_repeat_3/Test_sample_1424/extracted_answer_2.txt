In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, in the energy-momentum representation, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, as an inverse function. Specifically, it takes the form G_0(k, ω) ∝ 1 / (ω - ϵ_k), where ω is the energy variable. The function exhibits poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues.
