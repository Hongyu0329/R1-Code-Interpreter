    "### The Leading Order Expression for the Fixed Point Coupling in ϕ⁴ Theory\n\nIn the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is directly proportional to ε = 4 - d, where d is the number of spacetime dimensions. This result is a cornerstone of the epsilon expansion, a powerful technique in the study of critical phenomena and quantum field theory.\n\nThe calculation of the fixed point coupling begins with the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant, which describes how the coupling changes with the energy scale. For the O(N) symmetric ϕ⁴ theory in d = 4 - ε dimensions, the beta function for the coupling λ is given by:\n\nβ(λ) = -ελ + (N+8)λ² / (8π²)\n\nFor the single-component ϕ⁴ theory, we set N=1, which yields:\n\nβ(u) = -εu + (9u²) / (8π²)\n\nA fixed point of the renormalization group flow is a value of the coupling where the beta function vanishes, meaning the coupling no longer changes with the energy scale. Setting β(u*) = 0, we find two solutions:\n\nu*(-ε + 9u* / (8π²)) = 0\n\nOne solution is the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0. The other, non-trivial solution, is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point:\n\n-ε + 9u* / (8π²) = 0\n\nSolving for u*, we obtain the leading order expression in ε:\n\n**u* = (8π²ε) / 9**\n\nThis result is fundamental to understanding the universal properties of systems at their critical point, as described by ϕ⁴ theory. The existence of this non-trivial fixed point for ε > 0 allows for the calculation of critical exponents as an expansion in ε.\n\n<<<u* = (8π²ε) / 9>>>"
