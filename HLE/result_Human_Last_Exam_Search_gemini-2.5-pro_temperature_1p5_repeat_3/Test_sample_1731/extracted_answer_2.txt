The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta, as derived from large deviation theorems, correspond to those of a black-body radiation field in thermal equilibrium.

The **mean energy** of a single-frequency mode ν is given by the Planck distribution:
**⟨E(ν)⟩ = hν / (e^(hν/kT) - 1)**

The **entropy** of a single-frequency mode ν is given by:
**S(ν) = k * [ (1 + n̄(ν)) * ln(1 + n̄(ν)) - n̄(ν) * ln(n̄(ν)) ]**, where **n̄(ν) = 1 / (e^(hν/kT) - 1)** is the average photon number in that mode.

Here, *h* is Planck's constant, *k* is the Boltzmann constant, and *T* is the temperature.
