    "I have gathered fundamental information about the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems, as well as the Bose case for light quanta (photons). I understand that photons are bosons and obey Bose-Einstein statistics, with the particularity that their total number is not conserved. I have also found information on how large deviation theorems, particularly Sanov's theorem, are connected to statistical mechanics and the concept of entropy. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem is presented as closely related to Sanov's theorem, often used for empirical means.\n\nHowever, I still need to find a more direct link between these large deviation theorems and the specific calculation of equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy for a photon gas. While the concepts have been introduced, the application and the derivation of the equilibrium values are not yet clear. My next step will be to search for this explicit connection.I have found a very relevant paper titled \"Large Deviation Theory for Bose Gas of Photons and Planck's Oscillators\" by D. P. Shinde. This paper explicitly states that it uses the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems to calculate the entropies and rate functions for a Bose gas of photons. It also mentions that it reproduces the results of Bose and Planck. This is precisely the information I need to answer the user's request. The paper also discusses how the Lagrange multipliers method is used in conjunction with these theorems to find equilibrium values. I believe I have sufficient information to proceed with the final answer without further searches.\n\nUsing the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, we can determine the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a photon gas. This approach provides a statistical basis for the well-established laws of black-body radiation derived by Planck and Bose.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, the system of photons is most likely to be found in the macrostate that corresponds to the largest number of microscopic arrangements. Large deviation theory formalizes this by stating that the probability of observing a macroscopic state different from the equilibrium state decreases exponentially. The rate of this decrease is governed by a \"rate function,\" which is directly related to the entropy of the system.\n\nFor a gas of photons, which are indistinguishable bosons, the number of particles is not conserved. This is a key feature that distinguishes it from a typical massive Bose gas. When applying the large deviation framework, the equilibrium state is found by maximizing the entropy of the system under the constraint of a fixed total energy. This maximization process, often carried out using the method of Lagrange multipliers, leads to the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for photons, which is the foundation of Planck's law of black-body radiation.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n\nThe application of the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, which deals with large deviations of the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables, is particularly suited for determining the mean energy. In the context of a photon gas, the total energy is the sum of the energies of individual photons. The theorem helps in finding the most probable energy distribution, which corresponds to the equilibrium state. The equilibrium mean energy (⟨E⟩) for a given frequency ν is found to be:\n\n⟨E(ν)⟩ = hν / (e^(hν/kT) - 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant\n*   ν is the frequency of the photons\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant\n*   T is the absolute temperature\n\nThis expression gives the average energy of a single mode of frequency ν in the radiation field at thermal equilibrium.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem provides a large deviation principle for the empirical distribution of a sequence of random variables. In statistical mechanics, the rate function in Sanov's theorem is interpreted as the negative of the entropy. Therefore, maximizing the entropy corresponds to minimizing the rate function, which in turn identifies the most probable macroscopic state—the equilibrium state.\n\nThe equilibrium entropy (S) of the photon gas, derived from this framework and consistent with the Bose-Einstein statistics, is given by:\n\nS = k * [ (1 + n̄) * ln(1 + n̄) - n̄ * ln(n̄) ]\n\nwhere n̄ is the average number of photons in a given state, which for a particular frequency ν is:\n\nn̄(ν) = 1 / (e^(hν/kT) - 1)\n\nThis formula for entropy, when calculated for all possible states (or modes) of the photon gas, gives the total entropy of the black-body radiation at a given temperature. It is a direct consequence of the statistical nature of photons as indistinguishable bosons and is fundamentally linked to the probability of microscopic configurations as described by large deviation theory.\n\nIn essence, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding why a photon gas at a given temperature will have the specific mean energy and entropy predicted by Planck's law and Bose-Einstein statistics. These theorems quantify the vanishingly small probability of observing a system in any state other than the one that maximizes its entropy.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta, as derived from large deviation theorems, correspond to those of a black-body radiation field in thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe **mean energy** of a single-frequency mode ν is given by the Planck distribution:\n**⟨E(ν)⟩ = hν / (e^(hν/kT) - 1)**\n\nThe **entropy** of a single-frequency mode ν is given by:\n**S(ν) = k * [ (1 + n̄(ν)) * ln(1 + n̄(ν)) - n̄(ν) * ln(n̄(ν)) ]**, where **n̄(ν) = 1 / (e^(hν/kT) - 1)** is the average photon number in that mode.\n\nHere, *h* is Planck's constant, *k* is the Boltzmann constant, and *T* is the temperature.>>>"
