    "The primary distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip. This difference is a fundamental aspect of the aesthetic and technical principles that separate the two ballet methodologies.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, which is rooted in Russian classical tradition, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso. This means that during a cambré derrière, the dancer strives to keep both hips aligned and facing forward as much as possible, with the backbend initiating from the upper spine. The Vaganova technique prioritizes a controlled and anatomically precise execution, with the entire body working in harmony and the arms and head following specific, coordinated rules.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method, a neoclassical style developed in the United States, often breaks from this strict alignment to create a different visual line. A defining characteristic of the Balanchine style, particularly evident in positions like the arabesque, is the use of an open hip. Dancers are trained to open the hip of the working leg towards the audience, which creates the illusion of a longer, more extended line. This principle of using an open, and sometimes asymmetrical, posture extends to other movements, including backbends, to achieve the desired aesthetic of speed, length, and dynamic shapes.\n\nWhile there are also differences in arm placement (allongé), speed, and head position between the two methods, the deliberate opening of the hip in the Balanchine style marks the most significant departure from the Vaganova approach to a cambré derrière.\n\n*   **Arm placement (A):** Balanchine port de bras can be more open and less curved, sometimes with flexed wrists, compared to the softer, more classical lines of Vaganova.\n*   **Speed (C):** The Balanchine method is famously characterized by its speed and musicality.\n*   **Degree of backbend (D):** The flexibility required for both methods is immense, but the apearance of the backbend's depth is affected more by the hip and upper body placement than being a prescribed difference in degrees.\n*   **Placement of head (E):** Both techniques have specific rules for the head, but the hip alignment is a more foundational difference that dictates the overall shape of the movement.\n\nTherefore, the most defining difference is the placement of the hip.\n\n<<<B>>>"
