    "In the reflection group of type H3, an element possesses a regular eigenvector if and only if it is classified as a \"regular\" element. The corresponding eigenvalue for such a vector is known as a \"regular eigenvalue\". Therefore, the question asks for the number of regular elements in the H3 group that have a regular eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nThe reflection group H3, which is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron, consists of 120 elements. Its Coxeter number, denoted as `h`, is 10.\n\nFor an irreducible, well-generated complex reflection group like H3, an element is regular if and only if it is conjugate to a power of a Coxeter element, `c^k`, where `k` is an integer coprime to the Coxeter number `h`. A Coxeter element is any element that is a product of the simple reflections in some order. All Coxeter elements within a group are conjugate to each other and their order is equal to the Coxeter number `h`.\n\nThe number of regular elements in such a group is given by the formula: `φ(h) * |W| / h`, where `φ` is Euler's totient function, `|W|` is the order of the group, and `h` is the Coxeter number.\nFor the H3 group:\n*   `|W|` = 120\n*   `h` = 10\n*   `φ(10)` = 10 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 4\n\nThe number of regular elements is therefore `4 * 120 / 10 = 48`.\n\nThe next step is to determine if these 48 regular elements have a regular eigenvalue of order 10. The regular eigenvalues of a regular element `g` (which is conjugate to `c^k`) are given by `exp(2πi * k * m_j / h)`, where `m_j` are the exponents of the group that are coprime to the Coxeter number `h`.\n\nThe exponents of H3 are 1, 5, and 9. The Coxeter number is 10. The exponents coprime to 10 are 1 and 9.\nThus, for any regular element `g` in H3, its regular eigenvalues are of the form `exp(2πi * k * 1 / 10)` and `exp(2πi * k * 9 / 10)`, where `k` is coprime to 10 (i.e., `k` can be 1, 3, 7, or 9).\n\nFor any of these values of `k`, the greatest common divisor `gcd(k, 10)` is 1, and `gcd(9k, 10)` is also 1. This means that the resulting eigenvalues, `exp(2πik/10)` and `exp(18πik/10)`, are primitive 10th roots of unity, and therefore their order is 10.\n\nThis confirms that every regular element of the H3 reflection group has a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10. Consequently, the number of such elements is equal to the total number of regular elements.\n\nThere are 48 such elements.\n\n<<<48>>>"
