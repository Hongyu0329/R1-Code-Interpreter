    "Below is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the described problem.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is optimized for memory efficiency by only storing the first string\n * and processing the second string character by character from the input stream.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // A buffer is required to store the first string. The maximum string length is\n    // 100, so a buffer of 101 characters is needed for the string and the\n    // null terminator.\n    // Memory usage: 101 * sizeof(char) = 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string. scanf stops at the first whitespace character.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Consume the newline character left in the input buffer by scanf. This\n    // prepares the stream for reading the second string on the next line.\n    getchar();\n\n    // A variable to keep track of the index in the first string.\n    // 'char' is sufficient as the string length is at most 100.\n    // Memory usage: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // A variable to store each character of the second string.\n    // It must be of type 'int' to correctly handle the End-Of-File (EOF) value\n    // returned by getchar().\n    // Memory usage: sizeof(int) = 4 bytes (on typical systems).\n    int c2;\n\n    // Read the second string character by character until a newline or EOF is found.\n    while((c2 = getchar()) != '\\n' && c2 != EOF) {\n        // Compare the character from the first string with the one from the second,\n        // after converting both to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)c2)) {\n            puts(\"-1\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)c2)) {\n            puts(\"1\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n    \n    // If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n    puts(\"0\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this program is calculated as follows:\n*   **`s1`**: A character array of size 101 uses `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 bytes.\n*   **`i`**: A character variable uses `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n*   **`c2`**: An integer variable uses `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes (on standard 32/64-bit platforms).\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 4 = 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
