    "Zero 13C-labeled CO2 molecules are released during glycolysis.\n\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. The overall process involves a series of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions that break down the six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n\nCrucially, no carbon atoms are lost in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) during this pathway. The six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are all conserved in the two pyruvate molecules that are the final products. Therefore, regardless of which carbons are labeled with the ¹³C isotope, no labeled CO2 will be produced because no CO2 is produced at all.\n\nCarbon dioxide is released in subsequent metabolic processes, such as the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (pyruvate decarboxylation) and within the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), but not in glycolysis itself.\n\n<<<0>>>"
