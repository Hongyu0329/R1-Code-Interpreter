    "There is one cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 receptor, also known as GABRR1, has the UniProt accession number P24046. The protein consists of 479 amino acids. Like other GABA A receptor subunits, it has a characteristic structure that includes four transmembrane (TM) domains connected by intracellular and extracellular loops. A significant intracellular loop is present between the third and fourth transmembrane domains (TM3-TM4 linker).\n\nBased on the annotations from UniProt, the transmembrane domains of the human GABAAρ1 receptor are located at the following amino acid positions:\n*   **TM1:** 282-302\n*   **TM2:** 308-328\n*   **TM3:** 341-361\n*   **TM4:** 452-472\n\nThe TM3-TM4 linker, therefore, corresponds to the sequence of amino acids from position 362 to 451.\n\nThe amino acid sequence for this TM3-TM4 linker is:\nLREKLP**C**TSGLPPPRTAMLDGNYSDGEVNDLDNYMPENGEKPDRMMVQLTLASERSSPQRKSQRSSYVSMRIDTHAIDKYSRI\n\nBy examining this sequence, we can identify and count the number of cysteine residues, which are represented by the letter 'C'. In this specific linker sequence, there is only one cysteine residue.\n\n<<<1>>>"
