    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category involves two objects, say $A$ and $B$, two 1-morphisms (functors) $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$, and two 2-morphisms (natural transformations) $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$ and $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$ satisfying certain coherence conditions.\n\nIn this problem, the simplex category $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-category.\n*   **Objects:** The objects are finite non-empty ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. We are interested in $$ and $$.\n*   **1-Morphisms:** The 1-morphisms between $[n]$ and $[m]$ are order-preserving maps. Let $f: \\to$ and $g: \\to$ be two such maps.\n*   **2-Morphisms:** Since $\\Delta$ is locally posetal, a 2-morphism between two parallel 1-morphisms $\\alpha, \\beta: [n] \\to [m]$ exists if and only if $\\alpha(k) \\le \\beta(k)$ for all $k \\in [n]$.\n\nThe conditions for an internal adjunction between $f$ and $g$ are the existence of the unit and counit 2-morphisms:\n1.  **Unit ($\\eta$):** A 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{} \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$ must exist. According to the definition of 2-morphisms, this means $\\mathrm{id}_{}(k) \\le (g \\circ f)(k)$ for all $k \\in$. This simplifies to $k \\le g(f(k))$ for all $k \\in$.\n2.  **Counit ($\\epsilon$):** A 2-morphism $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{}$ must exist. This means $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{}(j)$ for all $j \\in$. This simplifies to $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in$.\n\nThese two conditions, for order-preserving maps $f$ and $g$, are precisely the definition of a **monotone Galois connection**, where $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint. An adjunction is uniquely determined by its left adjoint (or its right adjoint). A map between posets has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all existing suprema (joins).\n\nFor an order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ between finite total orders, this condition is equivalent to $f(0) = 0$.\n*   Let's check this: If $f$ is a left adjoint, it must preserve the smallest element (the empty join), so $f(0) = 0$.\n*   Conversely, if $f(0) = 0$, we can define its right adjoint $g: [m] \\to [n]$ by $g(j) = \\max\\{k \\in [n] \\mid f(k) \\le j\\}$. Since $f(0)=0$, the set is never empty, so $g$ is well-defined.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0) = 0$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: \\to$ is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of 24 integers:\n$f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$.\n\nThe constraint is $f(0) = 0$. So we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we only need to choose the 23 values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which contains 38 elements), such that the sequence is non-decreasing. This is a classic stars-and-bars problem, equivalent to choosing 23 items from 38 with replacement. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$, where $k=23$ and $n=38$.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nAs a check, we could instead count the number of right adjoints $g: \\to$. A map $g$ is a right adjoint if it preserves all infima (meets), which for a finite total order is equivalent to the condition $g(37)=23$. This would require counting non-decreasing sequences $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le 23$. This is choosing 37 numbers from the set $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$ (24 elements) with replacement, which gives $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$. Since $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, the methods agree.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\n$\\binom{60}{23}$\n>>>"
