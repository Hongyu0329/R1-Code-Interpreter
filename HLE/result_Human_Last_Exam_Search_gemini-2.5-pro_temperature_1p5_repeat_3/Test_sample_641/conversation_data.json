    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is determined by the sum of the sizes of its conjugacy classes of involutions. An involution is an element of order 2.\n\nFor the group G = PSU(4, q) where q is an odd prime power and `gcd(4, q+1) = 2`, as is the case for q=997 (since `gcd(4, 998) = 2`), there are two conjugacy classes of involutions. The size of a conjugacy class is the order of the group divided by the order of the centralizer of an element in that class.\n\nThe order of PSU(4, 997) is given by the formula:\n|PSU(4,q)| = (1/gcd(4, q+1)) * q⁶(q²-1)(q³+1)(q⁴-1)\nFor q = 997, this is:\n|PSU(4, 997)| = (1/2) * 997⁶ * (997²-1) * (997³+1) * (997⁴-1)\n\nThe two classes of involutions have centralizers with the following orders:\n\n1.  **First class of involutions (t₁):** The centralizer `C(t₁)` is isomorphic to the symplectic group `Sp(4, q)`.\n    The order of `Sp(4, q)` is `q⁴(q⁴-1)(q²-1)`.\n    The size of this conjugacy class is:\n    k₁ = |PSU(4,q)| / |Sp(4,q)| = [ (1/2) * q⁶(q²-1)(q³+1)(q⁴-1) ] / [ q⁴(q⁴-1)(q²-1) ] = (1/2)q²(q³+1).\n    For q = 997, the size of the first class is:\n    k₁ = (1/2) * 997² * (997³+1) = 492,543,486,008,426.\n\n2.  **Second class of involutions (t₂):** The centralizer `C(t₂)` has a more complex structure, with its order being `2 * |SL(2, q²)|`.\n    The order of the special linear group `SL(2, r)` is `r(r²-1)`. So, `|SL(2, q²)| = q²( (q²)² - 1 ) = q²(q⁴-1)`.\n    The order of the centralizer is `2q²(q⁴-1)`.\n    The size of this conjugacy class is:\n    k₂ = |PSU(4,q)| / |C(t₂)| = [ (1/2) * q⁶(q²-1)(q³+1)(q⁴-1) ] / [ 2q²(q⁴-1) ] = (1/4)q⁴(q²-1)(q³+1).\n    For q = 997, the size of the second class is:\n    k₂ = (1/4) * 997⁴ * (997²-1) * (997³+1) = 243,328,886,547,222,133,342,760.\n\nThe total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the sum of the sizes of these two classes:\nTotal Involutions = k₁ + k₂ = 492,543,486,008,426 + 243,328,886,547,222,133,342,760 = 243,821,430,033,230,559,351,186.\n\n<<<243821430033230559351186>>>"
