    "The Beatles song that most closely matches the description of starting with a chord jump from the tonic to a minor chord on the same root is **\"I'll Be Back\"**.\n\nWhile not strictly a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth, the song, which is in the key of A, opens with a striking and unusual shift from an A major chord to an A minor chord. This change from the tonic major (I) to the tonic minor (i) creates a sudden melancholic mood right at the start of the song and is a memorable harmonic device.\n\nThe progression is as follows:\n\n*   **A major (the tonic)**\n*   **A minor**\n\nThis shift can be found at the very beginning of the song, making it a strong candidate for the one you are looking for. The song appears on the album \"A Hard Day's Night\".\n\nIt is a rare and harmonically adventurous opening for a pop song of that era. Other Beatles songs are known for their unique chord progressions, such as the famous opening chord of \"A Hard Day's Night\" or the complex harmonies in \"If I Fell\" and \"Because\", but \"I'll Be Back\" features this particular and immediate major-to-minor shift.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
