    "### The Smallest Possible Number of Isometric Embeddings is Zero\n\nThe smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space, $X$, into a Banach space, $B$, of cardinality $K$ is **zero**.\n\nAn isometric embedding is a function that preserves the distances between all points of a space when mapping it into another space. For such an embedding to exist between a given finite ultrametric space $X$ and a specific Banach space $B$, the geometric structure of $B$ must be able to accommodate the distances defined in $X$. This is not always the case.\n\nA classic example demonstrates the possibility of zero embeddings:\n*   Let the finite ultrametric space **X** be a set of three points {x, y, z} where the distance between any two distinct points is 1. This space satisfies the ultrametric inequality, which states that for any three points a, b, and c, the distance d(a, c) must be less than or equal to the maximum of d(a, b) and d(b, c). Here, 1 ≤ max(1, 1), which is true.\n*   Let the Banach space **B** be the set of real numbers **ℝ** with the standard absolute value as the norm. This is a one-dimensional Banach space.\n\nTo isometrically embed $X$ into $B = ℝ$, we would need to find three distinct real numbers—let's call them $p_x, p_y, p_z$—such that the absolute difference between any two of them is exactly 1.\n\nLet's assume an ordering for these points on the real line, for instance, $p_x < p_y < p_z$.\n1.  The distance condition `|`$p_x - p_y$`|` = 1 implies $p_y - p_x = 1$.\n2.  The distance condition `|`$p_y - p_z$`|` = 1 implies $p_z - p_y = 1$.\n3.  However, the distance between $p_x$ and $p_z$ is then $p_z - p_x = (p_z - p_y) + (p_y - p_x) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThis result, `|`$p_x - p_z$`|` = 2, contradicts the requirement that the distance must be 1. No arrangement of three points on the real line can satisfy the condition of being mutually equidistant. Therefore, no isometric embedding of this particular ultrametric space $X$ into the Banach space **ℝ** exists.\n\nSince the number of embeddings in this valid case is 0, and the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is zero.\n\nIt is important to note that while an embedding into a *specific* Banach space is not guaranteed, foundational results in mathematics show that any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into *some* Banach space, such as Hilbert spaces ($\\ell_2$) or spaces of bounded sequences ($\\ell_\\infty$). For example, the three-point space described above can be embedded in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane **ℝ²** as the vertices of an equilateral triangle. However, the question specifies a *given* Banach space $B$, and as shown, an embedding might not exist."
