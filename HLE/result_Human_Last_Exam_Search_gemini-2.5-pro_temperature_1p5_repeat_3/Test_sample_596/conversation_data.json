    "There is exactly **one** higher dimensional rooted forest $(F,R)$ of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fails to have the forest $F$ simplicially collapse onto the root $R$.\n\nThis unique non-collapsible forest is the one where the forest $F$ is the triangulation of the Möbius band itself. The failure to collapse is a consequence of the Möbius band's non-orientability. In a higher-dimensional setting, a forest $F$ simplicially collapses onto its root $R$ if and only if the relative homology group $H_{d-1}(F, R)$ is trivial. For the 2-dimensional Möbius band, this condition applies to the first homology group, $H_1(F, R)$.\n\nWhen the forest $F$ is the entire triangulation of the non-orientable Möbius band, its first homology group contains torsion, which reflects its topological structure. A proper subcomplex, the root $R$, will not share this same homological property. This fundamental difference results in a non-trivial relative homology group, which in turn prevents the forest from simplicially collapsing onto its root.\n\nFor any forest \"smaller\" than the entire triangulation—that is, any forest that does not fully encompass the non-orientable topology of the Möbius band—this homological obstruction does not arise, and the forest will simplicially collapse onto its root. Therefore, there is only one such rooted forest that fails this condition.\n\n<<<1>>>"
