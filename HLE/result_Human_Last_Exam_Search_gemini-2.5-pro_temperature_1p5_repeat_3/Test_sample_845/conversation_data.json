    "The value computed between heartbeats when tracking Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)**.\n\nHRV is specifically the measurement of the variation in these time intervals between successive heartbeats. While IBI is a general term, other more specific terms are also used depending on the measurement technology:\n\n*   **R-R interval:** This is a very common term for the time between the peaks of the \"R\" wave in an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading. It is often used interchangeably with IBI, even when the data is captured by other means.\n*   **P-P interval:** When using photoplethysmography (PPG), as mentioned in the question, the time between the peaks of the pulse wave is sometimes referred to as the peak-to-peak (P-P) interval.\n\nIn essence, while the technology to capture the beat can differ (ECG vs. PPG), the fundamental value calculated for HRV analysis is the time elapsed between one heartbeat and the next.\n\n<<<Inter-beat interval (IBI)"
