    "There is no record of a specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" because \"Azikiwe\" has always been a part of his official name.\n\nHowever, the use of his middle name, Azikiwe, became a subject of public and political discussion around 2010. Reports from that time suggest that during his presidential campaign, he began to emphasize the name. For instance, during his official declaration to run for president in September 2010, he used his full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\nSome accounts suggest that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. While the name has always been part of his identity, its prominence in his public life can be traced to his political ascent to the presidency.\n\nIn official capacities and biographical records, his full name is consistently recorded as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan."
