    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then identify African flags with a corresponding rank. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns it contains. The prompt specifies that the values in each matrix are chosen to maximize the rank. This is a crucial instruction that guides the methodology.\n\n### Determining the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe flag of Denmark features a white Scandinavian cross on a red background. To represent this as a matrix with maximal rank, we can assign a unique basis vector to each color. For two colors (red and white), we can use the basis vectors of a 2D space, for example, Red = (1, 0) and White = (0, 1).\n\nA matrix representing the Danish flag would be composed of these vectors.\n*   The rows of the matrix that are part of the horizontal white bar of the cross would consist entirely of the vector for \"white,\" for instance, `((0, 1), (0, 1), ..., (0, 1))`.\n*   The rows that intersect the red field and the vertical white bar of the cross would be composed of a mix of vectors for \"red\" and \"white,\" for instance, `((1, 0), ..., (0, 1), ..., (1, 0))`.\n\nThe set of all row vectors in this matrix contains two fundamentally different types: rows representing the horizontal cross bar and rows representing the red field intersected by the vertical cross bar. These two types of vectors are linearly independent. Any attempt to write one as a scalar multiple of the other will fail. Therefore, the vector space spanned by the rows of the matrix is two-dimensional. The rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Identifying African Flags with Rank 2\n\nA flag will have a rank of 2 if its design is composed of exactly two colors, arranged in a way that produces two linearly independent row or column vectors. This is generally true for any two-colored flag that is not a solid color. Flags with more than two colors will typically have a rank of 3 or higher.\n\nThe following African nations have flags that consist of exactly two colors, and thus have a linear algebraic rank of 2:\n\n*   **Nigeria**: The flag of Nigeria consists of three vertical stripes, with green on the outer stripes and white in the center. The two colors, green and white, result in a rank of 2. The column vectors are of two distinct, linearly independent types.\n*   **Somalia**: Somalia's flag features a single white five-pointed star in the center of a light blue field. The two colors, blue and white, and the geometry of the star on the field result in two types of linearly independent row vectors (rows with just blue, and rows with blue and white), giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Tunisia**: The flag of Tunisia has a red crescent and a red star inside a white disk on a red field. The two colors, red and white, result in a rank of 2.\n*   **Morocco**: The flag of Morocco is a solid red field with a green pentagram (the Seal of Solomon) in the center. It is comprised of two colors, red and green, giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Burundi**: The flag of Burundi is complex, but primarily composed of three colors: red, green, and white. It is divided by a white saltire, with the fields being red and green, and a central circle containing three red stars. This flag contains three colors, and its rank would be 3.\n*   **Algeria**: The flag of Algeria is vertically split between green and white, with a red star and crescent in the center. This flag contains three colors and thus has a rank of 3.\n\nBased on this analysis, the African nations with flags that have the same rank as the Danish flag (a rank of 2) are those with exactly two colors in their design.\n\n<<<The flags of Nigeria, Somalia, Tunisia, and Morocco have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.>>>"
