In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the expression:
`∫_0^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, **x**)`
where `ϕ(τ, **x**)` is the neutral scalar field, `β` is the inverse temperature, `τ` is the imaginary time, **x** represents the spatial coordinates, `∂_τ` and `∇` are the derivatives with respect to imaginary time and spatial coordinates, respectively, and `m` is the mass of the scalar field. This expression corresponds to the quadratic part of the Euclidean action for the field.
