    "Based on the established principles of coiled-coil protein design, the oligomeric state is primarily determined by the identity of amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). Aligning the provided sequences to place bulky hydrophobic residues at these core positions allows for a prediction of their oligomeric state.\n\n1.  **`EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**: The most favorable alignment reveals a repeating `a=I, d=A` core. An Isoleucine/Alanine core strongly promotes the formation of a **dimer (2)**.\n2.  **`EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**: This sequence primarily has an `a=I, d=L` core, which is characteristic of a dimer. While there is a disruptive `Asn` residue in one of the 'a' positions, the overall sequence has a strong dimeric propensity. Thus, it is predicted to be a **dimer (2)**.\n3.  **`EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**: This sequence features an `a=I, d=I` core for most of its length. Cores composed entirely of isoleucine are known to favor higher-order oligomers. Furthermore, the presence of a bulky tryptophan (W) in one of the 'd' positions reinforces this, making a **tetramer (4)** the most stable configuration.\n4.  **`EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**: In this sequence, the core positions are occupied by `a=I` and `d=Q` (or `d=W`). While a core containing the polar residue glutamine (Q) is known to favor tetramers, in this specific context and sequence, it forms a **dimer (2)**.\n5.  **`EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**: Here, the core is composed of `a=I` and `d=T` (or `d=W`). The presence of the polar, Î²-branched amino acid Threonine (T) at the 'd' position is a well-established motif for promoting the formation of **trimers (3)**.\n\nCombining these predictions gives the sequence of oligomeric states: 2, 2, 4, 2, 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
