The normalized density of the invariant measure is a function \(\rho(x)\) that satisfies the equation \(\rho(y) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{\rho((y+k)^{-2})}{(y+k)^3}\) and the normalization condition \(\int_0^1 \rho(x) dx = 1\). There is no known expression for \(\rho(x)\) in terms of elementary functions.
