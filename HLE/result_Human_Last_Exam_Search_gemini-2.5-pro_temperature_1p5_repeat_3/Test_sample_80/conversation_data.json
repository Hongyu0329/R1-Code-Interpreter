    "A standard 8x8 chessboard has a total of 28 edge squares. These consist of the 8 squares on the top row, the 8 squares on the bottom row, and the 6 squares on each of the two side columns (not counting the corners twice).\n\nThe problem of placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on a chessboard is a well-known mathematical puzzle. For a standard 8x8 board, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed so that no two bishops attack each other is 14. Interestingly, any arrangement with this maximum number of bishops requires that all 14 bishops be placed on the edge squares of the board.\n\nTherefore, if the two players succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, they would have placed 14 bishops.\n\nTo find the number of edge squares that would lack bishops, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (placed bishops) = 14\n\nThus, 14 edge squares would be without bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
