    "The trefoil knot is the simplest non-trivial knot and a fundamental object of study in knot theory. It exists in two forms, the left-handed and the right-handed trefoil, which are mirror images of each other.\n\nA grid diagram is a way to represent a knot on a square grid. The \"grid number\" is the size of the smallest square grid that can represent the knot. For the trefoil knot, the minimal grid number is 3.\n\nWhen considering the grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot with this minimal 3x3 grid, and considering equivalences up to translation (shifting the rows and columns) and rotation of the grid, there are precisely two distinct diagrams.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot up to translation and rotation is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
