Between 1803 and 1823, the number of "destitute migrants" who settled on Colonel Thomas Talbot's land grant is not specifically recorded. However, by 1817, 804 families had been settled. Colonel Talbot's claimed acreage exceeded his original 5,000-acre grant by more than 60,000 acres, as his personal holdings grew to over 65,000 acres by 1821.
