    "The user's question asks for the maximum number of colors required to properly color a graph with 12345 vertices, given that the graph is not a complete graph. This is a question about the chromatic number of a graph.\n\nLet $n$ be the number of vertices in a graph $G$, which in this case is $n=12345$.\nThe chromatic number of a graph, denoted by $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe chromatic number of any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\nA coloring using $n$ distinct colors for each of the $n$ vertices is always a proper coloring.\n\nIt is a well-established theorem in graph theory that the chromatic number of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is equal to $n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. In a complete graph, every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, thus requiring a unique color for each vertex.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is not a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices.\nFor a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete, we have:\n$\\chi(G) < 12345$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nThis establishes an upper bound of 12344 for the chromatic number. To determine if this is the maximum possible value, we must check if there exists a non-complete graph with 12345 vertices that requires exactly 12344 colors.\n\nConsider the following two examples of graphs on $n=12345$ vertices:\n\n1.  **A complete graph with one edge removed ($K_n - e$)**: Let $G$ be a graph formed by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge between two vertices, say $v_1$ and $v_2$. This graph is not complete. Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color. The remaining 12343 vertices are all adjacent to each other and also to both $v_1$ and $v_2$. Let's consider the subgraph induced by the vertices $\\{v_1, v_3, v_4, \\dots, v_{12345}\\}$. This is a complete subgraph (a clique) of size 12344. A clique of size $k$ requires $k$ colors. Therefore, $\\chi(G) \\ge 12344$. Since we have already established that $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$, the chromatic number of this graph is exactly 12344.\n\n2.  **A disconnected graph with a large complete component**: Let $G$ be a graph that is the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices ($K_{12344}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$). The total number of vertices is $12344 + 1 = 12345$. This graph is not complete because it is not connected. The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. Thus, $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nBoth of these constructions yield a non-complete graph on 12345 vertices with a chromatic number of 12344. This shows that the upper bound of 12344 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
