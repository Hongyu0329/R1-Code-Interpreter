    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is $1$-resolvable.\n\nThis is because for any such functor, there exists a projective resolution of length 1. Specifically, the category of tame functors indexed by an upper semilattice, denoted `tame(J, vectK)`, is an abelian category in which every object has a minimal free resolution. A key result in this area states that every functor in `tame(J, vectK)` admits a 1-resolution.\n\nA 1-resolution for a functor $M$ is a long exact sequence of the form:\n$$ \\dots \\to 0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0 $$\nwhere $P_0$ and $P_1$ are projective objects. The existence of such a resolution for any tame functor indexed by an upper semilattice means that these functors have a projective dimension of at most 1. The use of homological algebra is instrumental in studying these functors.\n\n<<<1>>>"
