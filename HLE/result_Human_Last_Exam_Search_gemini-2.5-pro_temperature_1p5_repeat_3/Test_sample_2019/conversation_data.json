    "The search results primarily discuss the *n*-queens problem on a toroidal board, which is about placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* board. Specifically, they state that a solution for *n* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board exists if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. For *n*=5, a solution does exist.\n\nHowever, the user's question is about placing *k=4* non-attacking queens on an *n=5* toroidal board. This is a different problem, often denoted as the *k*-queens problem. The search results do not directly provide the number of ways for this specific configuration.\n\nI need to find resources that explicitly calculate the number of ways to place *k* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board. This might be found in enumerations of queen placements or through a computational approach if no direct formula or pre-calculated value is available. The problem is complicated by the toroidal nature of the board, which changes the diagonal attacks.\n\nSince the initial direct searches were not successful in finding the specific number, I need to look for more general resources or try a computational approach. The Online Judge problem suggests that this is a problem that can be solved by algorithms, but it only asks for one solution, not the total number of solutions.\n\nLet's try to search for enumerations of queen placements on toroidal boards.\n\nNew search queries:\n1.  \"number of ways to place k queens on n x n toroidal board\"\n2.  \"enumeration of non-attacking queen placements on toroidal board\"\n3.  \"4-queens on 5x5 torus solutions count\"\n4.  \"OEIS A178828\" - I will search for a relevant sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) which often contains counts for combinatorial problems. A search on the OEIS website for \"queens toroidal\" might yield results. Let's see what a google search on a potential sequence number does. It's a shot in the dark, but could be very effective.\n\nLet's perform this next set of searches.The search results from the second step are more promising. My search for \"OEIS queens on toroidal board\" led to several relevant sequences in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.\n\nSpecifically, OEIS A342372 is described as \"Triangle T(n,k) of number of ways of arranging k nonattacking semi-queens on an n X n toroidal board\". While it says \"semi-queens\", the description clarifies that a semi-queen \"can only move horizontal, vertical and parallel to the main diagonal of the board.\" It says \"Moves parallel to the secondary diagonal are not allowed.\" This is a crucial difference from a standard queen. A toroidal queen attacks along both main and anti-diagonals. So this sequence is likely not the correct one.\n\nHowever, the fact that such sequences exist is a very good sign. Let's re-examine the OEIS search results to see if there's one for full queens.\n\nThe search results for \"OEIS queens on toroidal board\" also show other potentially relevant sequences like \"Domination number for queen graph on an n x n toroidal board\" (A279402). This is not what I need. I need the number of independent sets of size 4 in the queen's graph on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n\nLet me try a more specific OEIS search. It's possible the information is buried in a less obviously named sequence. I will search the OEIS site directly.\n\nA direct search on OEIS for \"queens toroidal\" gives a few results. Let's analyze them.\n\n*   A099152: \"Number of ways to place n nonattacking queens on an n x n toroidal board.\" This is for n queens on an n x n board, not k queens.\n*   A342372: The semi-queen sequence we already found and likely discarded.\n*   A051515: \"Number of ways to place 3 nonattacking queens on an n X n toroidal board.\" This is very close! It gives T(n, 3). The formula is given as n^2*(n-2)*(n-3)*(n-4)/6 for n odd. This suggests there might be a known formula for k queens.\n*   Let's check the references for A051515. The formula is from a paper by V. Kotesovec. This is a very strong lead. His website might contain the answer.\n\nI will perform a search for Vaclav Kotesovec's work on this topic. He appears to have a comprehensive document called \"Non-attacking chess pieces\". This might contain the answer.\n\nSo the new plan is:\n1.  Search specifically for Vaclav Kotesovec's formulas for k non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal board.\n2.  Search his website or documents for the specific case of 4 queens on a 5x5 board.\n3.  If a general formula is found, apply it for n=5 and k=4.\n4.  If no explicit formula is found, this likely means the answer isn't readily available in a simple form and might require a dedicated computer search (which is beyond my capabilities as a language model). However, given the existence of a formula for 3 queens, it is plausible one exists for 4.\n\nLet's execute this refined search plan.The search results strongly point towards Vaclav Kotesovec as the primary authority on this type of problem. His extensive publication, \"Non-attacking chess pieces\", is the most likely source for the answer. The search results mention that this book contains hundreds of formulas for various chess piece placement problems, including for queens on toroidal boards.\n\nI have found several references to the 6th edition of this book, and it's available online as a PDF. The challenge is that it is a very large document (795 pages). Manually searching through this document for the specific formula or table entry for 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is the most logical next step.\n\nI need to find a table of values for the number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board. The book likely has a chapter on queens, and within that, a section on toroidal boards. I will be looking for T(n, k) or a similar notation, specifically for T(5, 4).\n\nI have high confidence that the answer is in Kotesovec's work. I will now try to locate the specific table or formula within his book. Since I cannot directly read a PDF, I will search for specific phrases that might appear in the book's table of contents or index, to narrow down where to look.\n\nLet's try queries that might quote the book's content directly. I'm looking for a table with values for n=5.\n\nI will attempt one final targeted search to see if someone has extracted and posted the specific table or formula I need, to avoid having to parse the entire book.The search results from the previous step confirm that Vaclav Kotesovec's book \"Non-attacking chess pieces\" is the definitive source for this kind of problem. A snippet from a PDF of the book explicitly mentions a section for \"4 Queens, toroidal board n x n\" and refers to it as sequence A172519 in the OEIS. It even states that the formula can be expressed in 12 parts based on n mod 12, or as a single formula involving cosine functions. This is a very strong confirmation.\n\nMy goal now is to find the specific value for n=5 and k=4 from Kotesovec's work or the corresponding OEIS entry. I'll search for the specific OEIS sequence A172519. This should give me a table of values or a formula I can use.The search for OEIS A172519 was highly successful. This sequence is explicitly defined as the \"Number of ways to place 4 nonattacking queens on an n X n toroidal board.\" The page provides a list of the first few terms of the sequence.\n\nThe terms provided are:\na(1) = 0\na(2) = 0\na(3) = 0\na(4) = 0\na(5) = 50\n\nThe question asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. According to the OEIS sequence A172519, for n=5, the value is 50.\n\nThis result is directly from a reliable source that specializes in integer sequences for combinatorial problems and references the work of Vaclav Kotesovec, who is an authority on this topic. The other search snippets corroborate that Kotesovec's work is the go-to reference for these problems and that OEIS A172519 is the sequence that corresponds to this specific problem.\n\nI have found a direct and reliable answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 50.\n\nThe number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is 50.\n<<<50>>>"
