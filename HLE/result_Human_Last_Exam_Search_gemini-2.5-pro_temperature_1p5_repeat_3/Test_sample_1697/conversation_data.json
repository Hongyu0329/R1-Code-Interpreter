    "The reaction described is a classic example of directed *ortho*-metalation (DoM), a powerful method for the regioselective functionalization of aromatic rings. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF**\n\n*   **Substrate**: The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two key functional groups on the benzene ring: a tertiary amide (-CON(Et)₂) at position 1 and a dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3.\n*   **Reagents**:\n    *   **sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium)** is a very strong base used to deprotonate (remove a proton from) a carbon atom.\n    *   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine)** is a chelating agent that coordinates to the lithium ion of sec-BuLi. This coordination breaks up sec-BuLi aggregates, increasing its basicity and reactivity.\n    *   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran)** is the solvent for the reaction.\n*   **Mechanism**: The reaction proceeds via directed *ortho*-metalation. In this process, a functional group on the aromatic ring, called a directing metalation group (DMG), complexes with the lithium atom of the organolithium reagent. This brings the strong base close to a proton at the *ortho* position (the adjacent carbon on the ring), facilitating its removal.\n\nIn N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, both the tertiary amide and the dimethylamino group can act as DMGs. However, the tertiary amide group (-CONR₂) is known to be one of the most powerful directing groups, significantly stronger than the dimethylamino group (-NR₂).\n\nThe -CON(Et)₂ group at position 1 will direct the lithiation to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C6). The -NMe₂ group at position 3 directs to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C4). Since both groups direct the deprotonation to the C2 position, and the amide is the much stronger directing group, the sec-BuLi will selectively remove the proton from the C2 position. This forms a new carbon-lithium bond, resulting in the intermediate N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction with methyl iodide**\n\n*   **Reagent**: Methyl iodide (CH₃I) is an electrophile.\n*   **Mechanism**: The organolithium intermediate formed in the first step is highly nucleophilic due to the C-Li bond. This nucleophilic carbon atom at the C2 position will attack the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The iodide ion is displaced, and a new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the aromatic ring and the methyl group.\n\n**Final Product**\n\nThe lithiation at C2 followed by quenching with methyl iodide results in the substitution of the hydrogen at C2 with a methyl group. Therefore, the final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
