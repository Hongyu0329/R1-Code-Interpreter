The management plan for this patient would begin with a thorough discussion about the poor prognosis of replanting the avulsed teeth after 28 hours. If the patient consents to proceed with replantation as a temporary measure to preserve bone, the teeth would undergo extra-oral root canal treatment before being replanted and stabilized with a flexible splint. Due to the patient's 7.5% HbA1c, indicating suboptimal diabetes control, there is an increased risk of infection and delayed healing, necessitating a possible consultation with her physician and antibiotic coverage. The key cells involved in this process are the non-viable periodontal ligament cells, which will lead to ankylosis, and the osteoclasts and osteoblasts that will mediate bone remodeling and root resorption. The patient's SNB angle of 88‚Å∞ signifies a forwardly positioned lower jaw (mandibular prognathism), which will be a critical factor in the design of a future prosthesis. For long-term replacement, a cast metal framework removable partial denture is recommended for its durability and support. The ideal abutment teeth would be the left second premolar as the primary support adjacent to the missing teeth, and the right canine and first premolar on the opposite side to provide crucial cross-arch stabilization and retention, preventing rotational forces and ensuring the longevity of the prosthesis.
