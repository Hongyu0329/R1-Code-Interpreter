    "The latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Charge at Huj**, which took place on November 8, 1917, during the First World War.\n\nElizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler, was a renowned British painter celebrated for her detailed and realistic scenes of British military campaigns. While she painted numerous battles from the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and other 19th-century conflicts, she also depicted several events from the First World War.\n\nHer painting, titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*, immortalizes what is considered one of the last great cavalry charges in British military history. During this engagement in the Sinai and Palestine campaign, British yeomanry regiments charged a position of Turkish, German, and Austrian artillery and infantry. The charge was successful, resulting in the capture of the enemy position, though with significant British casualties.\n\nOther First World War battles painted by Lady Butler include the Battle of Mons (August 1914) and the Battle of Loos (September 1915). However, the engagement at Huj in November 1917 is the latest of these events to be captured in her work. The painting is now housed in the Warwickshire Yeomanry Museum.\n\n<<<The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj>>>"
