    "To find the values of $P_{i}(+\\infty)$, we need to consider the steady-state of the system, which occurs when the probabilities no longer change with time. In this case, the derivatives $P_{i}'(t)$ become zero. Let $\\pi_i = P_{i}(+\\infty)$ denote the steady-state probabilities.\n\nThe given system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 \\pi_{0} + 0.65 \\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 \\pi_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) \\pi_{1} + 0.392 \\pi_{2} + 0.008 \\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 \\pi_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 \\pi_{2} - 0.008 \\pi_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1:\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\nLet's solve this system of equations.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 \\pi_{2} = 0.008 \\pi_{3} \\implies \\pi_{2} = \\pi_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 \\pi_{1} = (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_{2}$\n$0.4 \\pi_{1} = 0.4 \\pi_{2} \\implies \\pi_{1} = \\pi_{2}$\n\nCombining these results, we get $\\pi_{1} = \\pi_{2} = \\pi_{3}$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 \\pi_{0} = 0.65 \\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_{1}$\n\nNote that the second equation is a linear combination of the others (if you sum the first, third, and fourth equations and multiply by -1, you get the second equation), so it doesn't provide new information.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (equation 5) to find the specific values of the probabilities. We substitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2,$ and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}) \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}) \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}) \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}) \\pi_{1} = 1$\n$\\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow we can calculate $\\pi_0$:\n$\\pi_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1}$:\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
