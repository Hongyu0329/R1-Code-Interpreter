    "## Single Depression Characterizes the Lacrimal Recess of *Irritator challengeri*\n\nThe lacrimal recess of the spinosaurid dinosaur *Irritator challengeri* contains a single depression, according to detailed anatomical studies of its skull. This feature, more formally known as the lacrimal antorbital recess, is a distinct cavity on the lacrimal bone.\n\nScientific descriptions and 3D digital reconstructions of the *Irritator* skull consistently depict the lacrimal antorbital recess as a singular anatomical structure. Labeled diagrams from paleontological research identify this feature with the abbreviation \"laor\" (lacrimal antorbital recess), pointing to a single fossa.\n\nFurther anatomical discussion reveals that this recess was laterally covered by a thin, bulbous sheet of bone, which suggests a unified, single chamber rather than a series of smaller pits. This bony lamina is noted to mark the posterior boundary of the antorbital fossa. While the lacrimal bone itself has a complex shape with various processes and contacts with other skull bones, the recess within it is described and illustrated as a solitary depression."
