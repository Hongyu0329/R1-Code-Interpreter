    "To find the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state, we must evaluate the integral of the probability density function over this interval.\n\n**1. The Wave Function**\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' for a given quantum state 'n' is:\nψₙ(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the n=2 state, the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a)\n\n**2. The Probability Density**\n\nThe probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function:\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (√(2/a) sin(2πx/a))² = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a)\n\n**3. The Probability Integral**\n\nThe probability (P) of finding the particle between x₁ = 0.495a and x₂ = 0.505a is given by the integral:\nP = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.₅₀₅ₐ (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. Here, θ = 2πx/a.\nP = (2/a) ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.₅₀₅ₐ [1/2 * (1 - cos(4πx/a))] dx\nP = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\n**4. Evaluating the Integral**\n\nNow, we apply the limits of integration:\nP = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)) ]\nP = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))\n\nUsing the properties of sine, sin(2.02π) = sin(0.02π) and sin(1.98π) = -sin(0.02π):\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * (sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)))\nP = 0.01 - (2sin(0.02π)) / (4π)\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π)\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\n\nUsing a calculator for the final value (with angles in radians):\n*   sin(0.02π) ≈ 0.06279\n*   2π ≈ 6.2832\n*   P ≈ 0.01 - (0.06279 / 6.2832)\n*   P ≈ 0.01 - 0.009993\n*   P ≈ 0.00000654\n\nThis means the probability is approximately 0.000654%.\n\n<<<0.00000654>>>"
