    "While the specific name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 is not readily available in general historical summaries, research indicates that detailed records of the town's officials exist within the Bardejov city archives, which are now part of the Prešov State Archive.\n\nScholarly work, particularly the book *Bardejov v XV. storočí* (Bardejov in the 15th Century) by the Polish historian Stanisław Andrzej Sroka, is cited as containing a list of the town's judges (richtári) for this period. This work is based on extensive research of these historical archives. According to related academic texts, the governance of Bardejov from the 15th century was led by an elected judge and a twelve-member town council. It has been noted that in the second half of the 15th century, the position of judge was held by a limited number of individuals. For the decade of 1461–1470, only ten different people served as the town's judge.\n\nAlthough archival documents from 1461 related to the \"City of Bártfa\" are known to exist, their contents, which would likely name the judge of that year, are not fully digitized or widely accessible in online sources. Therefore, without direct access to Sroka's comprehensive list or the specific archival documents, the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 cannot be definitively stated.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
