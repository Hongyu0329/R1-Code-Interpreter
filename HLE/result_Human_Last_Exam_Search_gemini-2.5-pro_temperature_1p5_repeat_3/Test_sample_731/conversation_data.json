    "The semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as $SD_{512}$, is a 2-group (a p-group with p=2). It has the presentation $\\langle r, s | r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{9-2}-1} = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H such that for some integer k, H is equal to the set of k-th powers of all elements in G, denoted by $G^k = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\}$. For a finite p-group, it is a known property that the set of k-th powers $G^k$ always forms a subgroup.\n\nThe task is to find the number of distinct subgroups of the form $G^k$ for $G = SD_{512}$.\n\nAny integer k can be written as $k = m \\cdot 2^j$ where m is an odd number and $j \\ge 0$.\nThe set of k-th powers is $G^k = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\} = \\{g^{m \\cdot 2^j} | g \\in G\\}$.\nThe order of any element g in a 2-group is a power of 2. Since m is odd, it is coprime to the order of any element g in G. Therefore, the map $g \\mapsto g^m$ is a bijection on G.\nThis means that as g runs through all elements of G, $g^m$ also runs through all elements of G. Consequently, $G^k = \\{ (g^m)^{2^j} | g \\in G \\} = \\{ h^{2^j} | h \\in G \\} = G^{2^j}$.\nThis shows that any power subgroup is equal to one of the form $G^{2^j}$. We now need to identify how many distinct subgroups are in the sequence $G^1, G^2, G^4, G^8, \\dots$.\n\nThe elements of $SD_{512}$ are of the form $r^i$ and $sr^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\n*   **For j=0 ($k=1$):**\n    $G^1 = G = SD_{512}$. This is a non-abelian group of order 512.\n\n*   **For j=1 ($k=2$):**\n    $G^2 = \\{g^2 | g \\in G\\}$. We compute the squares of all elements:\n    *   For elements of the form $r^i$: $(r^i)^2 = r^{2i}$. This set generates the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements of the form $sr^i$: $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i sr^i = s(r^is)r^i = s(sr^{127i})r^i = r^{127i}r^i = r^{128i}$. This set generates the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$.\n    Since $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (as $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$), the union of these sets of powers is $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. So, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order 128.\n\n*   **For j $\\ge$ 2 ($k=2^j$):**\n    $G^{2^j} = \\{g^{2^j} | g \\in G\\}$.\n    *   $(r^i)^{2^j} = r^{i 2^j}$. This set generates the subgroup $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    *   $(sr^i)^{2^j} = ((sr^i)^2)^{2^{j-1}} = (r^{128i})^{2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 128 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{j+6}}$. Since the order of r is 256 ($=2^8$), for $j+6 \\ge 8$ (i.e., $j \\ge 2$), this power becomes the identity element, as $r^{i \\cdot 2^{j+6}} = (r^{2^8})^{i \\cdot 2^{j-2}} = 1$.\n    Thus, for $j \\ge 2$, $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we list the sequence of distinct power subgroups:\n1.  $G^1 = SD_{512}$ (order 512)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (order 128)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (order 64)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n8.  $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n9.  $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup of order 1)\n\nAny higher power of 2 for k, such as $G^{512}$, will also result in the trivial subgroup. Since $G$ is non-abelian and the other subgroups in the list are cyclic with distinct orders, all these 9 subgroups are distinct.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
