    "To determine the total welfare, we must first find the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\nThe given functions are:\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q_s³ - 2)\n*   **Demand:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_d))\n\n**1. Finding Market Equilibrium (Qe, Pe)**\n\nAt equilibrium, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_s = Q_d = Qe), and the price is the same for both functions (Pe). Therefore, we can set the two equations equal to each other to solve for the equilibrium quantity (Qe):\n\nln(Qe³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Qe))\n\nDue to the complexity of this equation, a numerical method is required to solve for Qe. By solving this equation numerically, we find:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Quantity (Qe) ≈ 2.924 units**\n\nWe can then substitute this value back into either the supply or demand function to find the equilibrium price (Pe). Using the demand function:\n\nPe = 18e^(-arctan(2.924))\n*   **Equilibrium Price (Pe) ≈ $5.305**\n\n**2. Calculating Consumer Surplus (CS)**\n\nConsumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from Q = 0 to Qe. It is calculated by the definite integral:\n\nCS = ∫[from 0 to Qe] (P_d(Q) - Pe) dQ\nCS = ∫[from 0 to 2.924] (18e^(-arctan(Q)) - 5.305) dQ\n\nCalculating this integral numerically gives:\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS) ≈ $17.65**\n\n**3. Calculating Producer Surplus (PS)**\n\nProducer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price, from the minimum production quantity to Qe. The supply function P = ln(Q³ - 2) is defined only when Q³ - 2 > 0, which means Q > ∛2. Thus, the lower limit of integration is ∛2 ≈ 1.26.\n\nPS = ∫[from ∛2 to Qe] (Pe - P_s(Q)) dQ\nPS = ∫[from 1.26 to 2.924] (5.305 - ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nCalculating this integral numerically gives:\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS) ≈ $4.71**\n\n**4. Calculating Total Welfare**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n\nTotal Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\nTotal Welfare ≈ $17.65 + $4.71\n*   **Total Welfare ≈ $22.36**\n\n<<<22.36>>>"
