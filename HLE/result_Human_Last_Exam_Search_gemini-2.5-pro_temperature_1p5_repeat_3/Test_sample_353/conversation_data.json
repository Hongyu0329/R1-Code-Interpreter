    "The exact value of the angle α for the A(α)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given in terms of `arctan()`. This angle represents the largest wedge of the complex plane, symmetric about the negative real axis, that is contained within the stability region of the method. The BDF4 method is known to be A(α)-stable with α ≈ 73°.\n\nThe stability of a linear multistep method is determined by the roots of its characteristic polynomial, which is derived from the method's formula. For the BDF4 method, the boundary of the stability region can be expressed as a curve in the complex plane. The angle α is determined by finding the tangent to this curve that passes through the origin.\n\nRecent work by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, and further simplified by Gander and Wanner, has led to the determination of the exact value for this angle. The calculation involves parameterizing the stability boundary and finding the extremal angle.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the square of the tangent of the stability angle α, which is `tan²(α)`, is a rational number. Specifically, `tan²(α) = 24/7`. This leads to the exact value for the angle α.\n\nThe exact value is:\nα = arctan(√(24/7)) = arctan(2√6/√7) = arctan(2√42/7)\n\n<<<arctan(sqrt(24/7))>>>"
