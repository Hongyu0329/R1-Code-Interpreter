    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclic reaction of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, as explained by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type and Electron Count**: The reaction is an electrocyclic ring-closure. The reactant, deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, is a conjugated polyene with four π-bonds, meaning it is an 8π-electron system. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, for a system with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 in this case), the thermal electrocyclization proceeds through a **conrotatory** mechanism.\n\n2.  **Frontier Molecular Orbital (HOMO) Analysis**: In a thermal reaction, the electrons in the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the ground state determine the stereochemical outcome. For an 8π-electron linear polyene, the HOMO is ψ₄. The terminal lobes of the ψ₄ molecular orbital have opposite signs on the same face of the π-system. To achieve constructive overlap and form a new σ-bond, the termini of the polyene must rotate in the same direction—a conrotatory motion.\n\n3.  **Stereospecificity of the Reaction**: Electrocyclic reactions are known to be highly stereospecific. A specific stereoisomer of the reactant will lead to a specific stereoisomer of the product. The stereochemistry of the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, dictates the stereochemical outcome of the conrotatory ring closure.\n\n4.  **Predicting the Product**: When the \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) isomer of deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene arranges itself into the helical conformation necessary for ring closure, the substituents at the termini (C-2 and C-9) have a specific orientation. The two possible conrotatory motions (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) are not energetically equivalent. One of these pathways leads to the *cis*-isomer (A) and the other to the *trans*-isomer (B). Due to steric interactions in the transition state, one pathway is strongly favored over the other, a phenomenon known as torquoselectivity. For the \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) isomer, the conrotatory closure that leads to the *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene (isomer A) is sterically favored.\n\nExperimental evidence confirms this theoretical prediction. The thermal cyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene has been shown to yield exclusively the *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene. The formation of the *trans*-isomer (B) is not observed from this starting material.\n\nTherefore, FMO theory predicts that the reaction is highly stereospecific, forming only the *cis*-isomer (A).\n\nThe predicted ratio of A (*cis*-isomer) to B (*trans*-isomer) is 100:0.\n\n<<<100:0>>>"
