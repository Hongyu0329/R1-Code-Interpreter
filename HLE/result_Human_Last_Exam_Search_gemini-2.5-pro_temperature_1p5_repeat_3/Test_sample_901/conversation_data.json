    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol results in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThis reaction is an E2 elimination, which has a strict stereochemical requirement. The hydrogen atom to be removed and the bromine leaving group must be in an anti-periplanar (or trans-diaxial) orientation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this product is formed:\n1.  **Identify the Reactant's Stereochemistry:** The designation (1S,2R) for 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *trans* to each other.\n2.  **Chair Conformations:** The more stable chair conformation of this *trans* isomer has both the bulky bromine and methyl groups in equatorial positions.\n3.  **Requirement for E2 Elimination:** For the E2 reaction to occur, the molecule must flip into its less stable chair conformation. This places the bromine atom in an axial position, which is necessary for elimination. In this conformer, the methyl group is also forced into an axial position.\n4.  **Identifying the Removable Proton:** With the bromine atom in an axial position (at C1), the base can only remove a proton that is also in an axial position on an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n    *   **At Carbon 2 (C2):** The methyl group is in the axial position, meaning the hydrogen on C2 is in an equatorial position. Since there is no axial hydrogen, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 (which would lead to 1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product) is not possible.\n    *   **At Carbon 6 (C6):** This carbon has an axial hydrogen which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n5.  **Product Formation:** The strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide) removes the axial proton from C6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The resulting product, when named according to IUPAC rules, is 3-methylcyclohexene, which is the less substituted (non-Zaitsev or Hofmann-like) product.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemical requirements of the E2 mechanism dictate the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene as the sole product, even though it is the less thermodynamically stable alkene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
