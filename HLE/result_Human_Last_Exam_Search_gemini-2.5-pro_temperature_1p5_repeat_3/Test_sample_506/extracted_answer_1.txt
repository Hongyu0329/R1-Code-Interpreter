**1. Valsartan (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker - ARB):** An ARB is a first-line agent that is strongly recommended for patients with hypertension and compelling comorbidities like diabetes. For MM, whose A1C is 6.7%, this medication class is critical for providing renal protection. It works by blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a key pathway in blood pressure regulation. An ARB is often chosen over an ACE Inhibitor due to a lower risk of cough.

**2. Amlodipine (Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker - CCB):** Amlodipine is a potent vasodilator and is recommended as a first-line antihypertensive agent, particularly for African American patients. Its mechanism is complementary to that of an ARB, and studies have shown that using a CCB in combination with an ARB leads to significant blood pressure reduction. Given that MM's hypertension is not well-controlled, a powerful and synergistic combination is essential.

**3. Spironolactone (Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist - MRA):** MM's case is indicative of resistant hypertension, defined as blood pressure that remains above goal despite treatment with three antihypertensive agents of different classes. Typically, the third agent would be a thiazide diuretic, but this class is unavailable for this patient. The next, most effective evidence-based step for treating resistant hypertension is to add an MRA like spironolactone. Clinical trials, such as PATHWAY-2, have demonstrated that spironolactone is superior to adding a beta-blocker or an alpha-blocker for blood pressure reduction in this population. Low-dose spironolactone has been shown to cause a significant fall in systolic blood pressure, often exceeding 20 mmHg, when added to other therapies.
