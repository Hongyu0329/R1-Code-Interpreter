    "I have now defined the key terms.\n- A **finite group** is a group with a finite number of elements.\n- A **product-free set** S in a group G is a subset where for all x, y, z in S, the relation xy = z does not hold.\n- A set is **maximal by inclusion** if it cannot be extended without losing its defining property. In this context, a product-free set S is maximal by inclusion if for any element g in G but not in S, the set S U {g} is no longer product-free.\n\nNow I need to find the specific connection between these concepts to answer the user's question. I need to find papers or results that classify or count the number of finite groups having maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.The search results indicate that the classification of finite groups containing maximal product-free sets of small sizes has been a subject of research. Specifically, a paper by Street and Whitehead, mentioned in the search result by Anabanti and Hart, classified all finite groups containing maximal product-free sets of size 2. Another result by Anabanti mentions the classification of abelian groups with locally maximal product-free sets of size 4, and continues the work on the classification for small sizes. A paper by Vsevolod F. Lev also mentions the determination of all groups with a maximal (by inclusion) sum-free set of size at most 2, which is equivalent to a product-free set in the abelian case.\n\nTo provide a complete answer, I need to find the specific result of the classification for size 2. It appears this information is contained in a paper by Street and Whitehead, which I need to locate. Since the initial searches did not directly provide the classification, I will try a more targeted search for this specific paper or its findings.I have successfully found references to the classification of finite groups containing maximal product-free sets of size 2. The papers by Giudici and Hart (2009) and Anabanti and Hart (2016) explicitly state that the former paper contains this classification. The search also provided related information about \"filled groups\" and classifications for other small-sized maximal product-free sets, which helps to put the specific question into a broader research context.\n\nHowever, the actual classification, i.e., the list or description of the groups, is not detailed in the abstracts. To give a precise and complete answer, I need to find the content of the paper by Giudici and Hart. The user is asking \"How many finite groups...\", which implies a need for a specific number or a descriptive classification that allows for counting. The current information confirms that such a classification exists but does not provide the classification itself. Therefore, the next step is to find the details of this classification.The search has been successful in locating the key paper by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart, \"Small maximal sum-free sets,\" which, as confirmed by multiple sources, contains the classification of finite groups with maximal product-free sets of size 2. The term \"sum-free\" in the title is equivalent to \"product-free\" in the context of general group theory.\n\nThe paper's abstract and a key proposition explicitly state the classification for a maximal sum-free (product-free) set S of size 2. The classification is divided based on whether the set S generates the entire group G.\n\nSpecifically, the paper provides tables and descriptions for the possible groups ⟨S⟩ generated by a maximal product-free set S of size 2. It also states that G must be a group such that ⟨S⟩ is a normal subgroup and the quotient G/⟨S⟩ is either trivial or an elementary abelian 2-group.\n\nThe possible structures for ⟨S⟩ where S = {a, b} is a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\n- If S contains no involutions, then ⟨S⟩ is a cyclic group, and the possibilities are given in Table 1 of the paper.\n- If S contains an involution 'a', then ⟨S⟩ can be C₂ x C₂, C₆, or D₆ (the dihedral group of order 6), with specific conditions on the elements 'a' and 'b'.\n- The paper also mentions the specific cases where G is C₈ and S = {x², x⁶}, and where G is the quaternion group Q₁₂ and S = {g³, g²}.\n\nHowever, the exact number of such finite groups is not a single integer, but rather a characterization of their structure. The question \"How many\" can be interpreted as asking for this classification. I have now gathered sufficient detail to provide a comprehensive answer based on the classification found in the paper by Giudici and Hart. Therefore, no further searching is required.\n\nThere are infinitely many finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. The classification of these groups was provided by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". The term \"sum-free\" is often used in the context of abelian groups, but it is equivalent to \"product-free\" in the general group setting.\n\nA set S is a product-free set in a group G if for any elements x, y, z in S, the equation xy = z has no solution. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G.\n\nThe structure of a finite group G containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set S of size 2, denoted as S = {a, b}, is constrained by the structure of the subgroup generated by S, ⟨S⟩. This subgroup ⟨S⟩ must be a normal subgroup of G, and the quotient group G/⟨S⟩ must be an elementary abelian 2-group (which includes the trivial group).\n\nThe classification of the possible subgroups ⟨S⟩ is as follows:\n\n**Case 1: The product-free set S contains no involutions.**\nIn this scenario, the subgroup ⟨S⟩ must be a cyclic group. The specific possibilities for S within these cyclic groups are detailed in the aforementioned paper.\n\n**Case 2: The product-free set S contains at least one involution.**\nIf S = {a, b} contains an involution (an element of order 2), the possible structures for the subgroup ⟨S⟩ are:\n*   **C₂ × C₂**: The Klein four-group. Here, 'a' and 'b' can be any pair of distinct involutions.\n*   **C₆**: The cyclic group of order 6. In this case, 'a' is the unique involution, and 'b' is any element of order 3.\n*   **D₆**: The dihedral group of order 6 (isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃). Here, 'a' can be any involution, and 'b' can be any element of order 3.\n\n**Additional specific cases include:**\n*   The cyclic group of order 8, **C₈**, with the maximal product-free set S = {x², x⁶}, where x is a generator of the group.\n*   The quaternion group of order 12, **Q₁₂**, which is generated by elements g and h with the relations g⁶ = 1, g³ = h², and hg = g⁻¹. In this group, the set S = {g³, g²} is a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nSince for any of these possible subgroups ⟨S⟩, we can construct a larger group G by taking a direct product with any elementary abelian 2-group, and ⟨S⟩ will remain a normal subgroup with the required quotient, there are infinitely many such finite groups. For example, if ⟨S⟩ is one of the groups listed above, then G = ⟨S⟩ × (C₂)ⁿ for any integer n ≥ 0 is a group that contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\nIn summary, there is no single finite number of such groups; instead, they are characterized by the specific structures of the subgroups generated by the product-free set and the relationship between this subgroup and the entire group.\n\n<<<There are infinitely many finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2, and they are classified by the structure of the subgroup generated by the product-free set.>>>"
