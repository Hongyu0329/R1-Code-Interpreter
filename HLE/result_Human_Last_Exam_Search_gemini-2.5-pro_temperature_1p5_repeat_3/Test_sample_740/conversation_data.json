    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The values of the parameter `λ` for which this equation has no solution are determined by the eigenvalues of the associated integral operator. The existence of a solution depends on the value of `n`, which is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, the solution will be presented in terms of a general integer `n ≥ 1`.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ ((xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)) u(y) dy`, for `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\nThe kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be simplified as a sum of polynomials:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k y^{n-1-k}`.\n\nSince the kernel is a sum of products of functions of `x` and `y` separately (a degenerate kernel), the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Let's define the moments `m_k` of the function `u(y)` as:\n`m_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nSubstituting the kernel's expansion into the equation gives:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} m_k x^{n-1-k}`.\n\nTo find the moments `m_k`, we substitute this expression for `u(x)` back into their definition:\n`m_k = ∫₀¹ y^k (1 + λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} m_j y^{n-1-j}) dy`\n`m_k = 1/(k+1) + λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} m_j / (k+n-j)`.\n\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` moments `m_0, m_1, ..., m_{n-1}`. In matrix form, this is `(I - λA)m = b`, where:\n*   `m` is the vector of moments `[m_0, ..., m_{n-1}]ᵀ`.\n*   `b` is the vector `[1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n*   `A` is the `n x n` matrix with elements `A_{kj} = 1/(k+n-j)` for `k, j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n\nThis system fails to have a unique solution if the determinant of the matrix `(I - λA)` is zero. This occurs when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. Let `μ` be an eigenvalue of `A`. Then for `λ = 1/μ`, the system either has no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, for `λ = 1/μ`, a solution exists only if the function `f(x)=1` is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator `(I - λT*)`. It can be shown that this condition is equivalent to `μm_0 = 0`, where `m_0` is the first component of the eigenvector `m` corresponding to the eigenvalue `μ` of matrix `A`.\n\nSince the matrix `A` is invertible, its eigenvalues `μ` are non-zero. Thus, the condition for the existence of a solution becomes `m_0 = 0`.\n*   If for an eigenvalue `μ`, the corresponding eigenvector must have `m_0 ≠ 0`, then for `λ = 1/μ`, there is **no solution**.\n*   If an eigenvector can have `m_0 = 0`, then for `λ = 1/μ`, there are infinitely many solutions.\n\nIt has been established that for this specific matrix `A`, any eigenvector `m` corresponding to any eigenvalue `μ` must have its first component `m_0` non-zero. Therefore, for every eigenvalue `μ` of matrix `A`, the corresponding value `λ=1/μ` will result in the equation having no solution.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A` where `A_{kj} = 1/(k+n-j)`.\n\n### Examples for specific `n`\n\n**Case n = 1:**\nThe integral equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`.\n*   The matrix `A` is a 1x1 matrix: `A = [A₀₀] = [1/(0+1-0)] = [1]`.\n*   The only eigenvalue is `μ = 1`.\n*   The value of `λ` with no solution is `λ = 1/μ = 1`.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\nThe integral equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x+y) u(y) dy`.\n*   The matrix `A` is a 2x2 matrix:\n    `A = [[1/(0+2-0), 1/(0+2-1)], [1/(1+2-0), 1/(1+2-1)]] = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`.\n*   The eigenvalues `μ` are the roots of the characteristic equation `det(A - μI) = 0`:\n    `(1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0`\n    `μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0`\n    `12μ² - 12μ - 1 = 0`.\n*   The eigenvalues are `μ = (12 ± √192) / 24 = (3 ± 2√3) / 6`.\n*   The values of `λ` with no solution are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues:\n    `λ = 1/μ = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = 2(3 ∓ 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the given integral equation has no solution depend on the integer `n`. These values are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n × n` matrix `A` whose elements are given by:\n`A_{ij} = 1/(i + n - j)` for `i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nFor any given `n`, all reciprocals of the eigenvalues of this matrix correspond to values of `λ` for which no solution exists.\n\nFor `n=1`, the value is `λ = 1`.\nFor `n=2`, the values are `λ = -6 + 4√3` and `λ = -6 - 4√3`.\n\n<<<The values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` with entries `A_{ij} = 1/(i + n - j)` for `i, j = 0, ..., n-1`.>>>"
