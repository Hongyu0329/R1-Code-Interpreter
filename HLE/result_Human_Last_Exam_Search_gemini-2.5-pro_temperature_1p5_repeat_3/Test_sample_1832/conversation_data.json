    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which are components of the gravitational field in general relativity, are derived from the derivatives of this metric.\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric are as follows, where the coordinates are $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$:\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt} = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr} = -\\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi} = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{rt} = \\Gamma^t_{tr} = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi\\theta} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nDue to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols in their lower two indices ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), it is customary to count the unique non-zero components. Counting these unique, non-zero symbols gives a total of 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
