    "The integral of the expression ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx is given by ln|F₃(x)|. To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we calculate the value of [ln|F₃(x)|] at the limits of integration:\n\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\nFirst, we determine the values of F₃(0) and F₃(1) by following the defined sequence of functions:\n\n**Calculation for x = 0:**\n*   F₀(0) = 0\n*   F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0\n*   F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1\n*   F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n**Calculation for x = 1:**\n*   F₀(1) = 1\n*   F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)\n*   F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\nSince both F₃(0) and F₃(1) are positive, we can remove the absolute value signs. The value of the integral V is:\n\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing these expressions, the numerical value of V is calculated to be approximately 0.548749.\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548749 = 5487.49\n\nThe closest integer to 5487.49 is 5487.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
