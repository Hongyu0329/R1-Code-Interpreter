Changing the amide group to a PEG group is a valid and recommended strategy to solve the precipitation problem. The core of your probe, thioxanthenone, is hydrophobic and likely the cause of the poor solubility. Adding a PEG chain (PEGylation) is a standard and highly effective method for increasing the water solubility of such compounds. The hydrophilic nature of PEG would likely keep your probe dissolved in the cell culture medium even at high concentrations.
