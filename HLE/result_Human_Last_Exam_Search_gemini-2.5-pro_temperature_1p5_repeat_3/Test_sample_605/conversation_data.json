    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link defined by a Newton non-degenerate polynomial is a topological invariant determined by the geometry of the polynomial's Newton polyhedron. The invariant, denoted `cn(f)`, is the minimum number of variables present in any monomial of the polynomial `f` that corresponds to a vertex of its Newton polyhedron, excluding those vertices that lie on a coordinate axis.\n\nThe given Calabi-Yau link is represented by the equation:\n`0 = z_1^8z_3 + z_1^4z_2^3z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3`\n\nAnd it exists in the ambient space `C^5` defined by the weights `(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n\nTo determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Verify Non-degeneracy**: We first check if the polynomial is weighted-homogeneous with respect to the given weights.\n    *   `deg(z_1^8z_3) = 8 * 22 + 49 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224`\n    *   `deg(z_1z_2^7) = 1 * 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_2z_3^4) = 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_4^3z_5) = 3 * 50 + 1 * 75 = 150 + 75 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_5^3) = 3 * 75 = 225`\n\n    Since the monomial `z_1^4z_2^3z_3` has a different weighted degree (224) from the others (225), the polynomial is not weighted-homogeneous. This indicates that we must use the more general formula for Newton non-degenerate polynomials, which relies on the exponent vectors of the monomials.\n\n2.  **Identify Exponent Vectors**: We list the exponent vectors for each monomial in the polynomial `f`. The exponent vector `v = (e1, e2, e3, e4, e5)` corresponds to a monomial `z_1^e1 * z_2^e2 * z_3^e3 * z_4^e4 * z_5^e5`.\n    *   `v1 = (8, 0, 1, 0, 0)`\n    *   `v2 = (4, 3, 1, 0, 0)`\n    *   `v3 = (1, 7, 0, 0, 0)`\n    *   `v4 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`\n    *   `v5 = (0, 1, 4, 0, 0)`\n    *   `v6 = (0, 0, 0, 3, 1)`\n    *   `v7 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 3)`\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula**: Assuming the polynomial is convenient and these monomials correspond to the vertices of its Newton polyhedron, we apply the formula. We calculate `l(v)`, the number of non-zero entries for each vector `v`. The formula excludes vertices that lie on a coordinate axis.\n    *   The vector `v7 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 3)` lies on the `z_5` coordinate axis, so it is excluded from the minimum calculation.\n    *   The other vectors do not lie on any coordinate axis.\n\n4.  **Calculate l(v) for each relevant vertex**:\n    *   `l(v1) = l(8, 0, 1, 0, 0) = 2`\n    *   `l(v2) = l(4, 3, 1, 0, 0) = 3`\n    *   `l(v3) = l(1, 7, 0, 0, 0) = 2`\n    *   `l(v4) = l(1, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 5`\n    *   `l(v5) = l(0, 1, 4, 0, 0) = 2`\n    *   `l(v6) = l(0, 0, 0, 3, 1) = 2`\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum**: The Crawley-Nordström invariant `cn(f)` is the minimum of these values.\n    `cn(f) = min(2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 2) = 2`\n\n<<<2>>>"
