The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron undergoing diffusion in a bulk semiconductor, a phenomenon known as weak localization, is given by the expression:

**δσ₃D ≈ - (e² / (π²ħ)) * [1/l - π/(2Lφ)]**

where:
*   **δσ₃D** is the change in the three-dimensional conductivity.
*   **e** is the elementary charge.
*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant.
*   **l** is the electron's elastic mean free path.
*   **Lφ** is the electron's phase coherence length.

This correction is negative, indicating a reduction in conductivity due to the quantum interference that enhances the probability of an electron returning to its starting point. The magnitude of this correction is governed by the material's purity and defect concentration (which determine `l`) and its temperature (which strongly influences `Lφ`).
