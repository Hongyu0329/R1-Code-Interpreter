    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe basis for this calculation is the original \"nanocar\" molecule designed by a team led by Professor James Tour at Rice University in 2005. The term \"perfluoro\" indicates a molecule where all hydrogen (H) atoms have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms. Therefore, to determine the number of fluorine atoms, one must first know the number of hydrogen atoms in the standard nanocar structure.\n\nThe specific version of the nanocar detailed in chemical literature has a molecular formula of C430H274O12. This formula includes the H-shaped chassis, the four C60 fullerene \"wheels,\" and the long decyloxy sidechains that are attached to the chassis, which were included in the original synthesis to improve the molecule's properties.\n\nSince a perfluorinated version would substitute a fluorine atom for each of the 274 hydrogen atoms, a perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms. The fullerene wheels themselves are composed entirely of carbon and have no hydrogen atoms to be replaced.\n\n<<<274>>>"
