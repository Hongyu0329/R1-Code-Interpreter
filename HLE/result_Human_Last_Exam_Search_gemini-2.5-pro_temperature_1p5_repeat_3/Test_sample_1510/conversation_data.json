    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. In total, there are 17 distinct wallpaper groups. The point group of a wallpaper group describes the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern, and its order can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6, a principle known as the crystallographic restriction theorem.\n\nA point group of order 2 corresponds to either a 180-degree rotation (a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as C₂ or Z₂) or a single reflection (a dihedral group of order 2, denoted as D₁ which is isomorphic to Z₂).\n\nThe wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has 2-fold rotational symmetry but no reflections. Its point group is Z₂ (or C₂).\n*   **pm**: This group has parallel reflection axes but no rotational symmetry apart from the identity. Its point group is Z₂ (or D₁).\n*   **pg**: This group features parallel glide reflection axes and no rotational symmetry. Its point group is Z₂ (or D₁).\n*   **cm**: This group contains both reflections and glide reflections on parallel axes. Its point group is Z₂ (or D₁).\n\nOther wallpaper groups, such as pmm, pmg, pgg, and cmm, have a point group of order 4 (Z₂ × Z₂).\n\n<<<4>>>"
