    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first need to identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors and is often associated with the stable or unstable manifolds of a saddle point.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting the derivatives to zero:\n$d'(t) = 0$\n$u'(t) = 0$\n\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the u-coordinates of the equilibrium points to be $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 2d^2$\n    Setting $d'(t) = 0$ gives $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$.\n    This gives an equilibrium point at **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 2d^2 + 2d$\n    Setting $d'(t) = 0$ gives $2d(d+1) = 0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives two equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$) are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**2. Stability Analysis of the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe linearize the system by finding the Jacobian matrix J at each equilibrium point.\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & -3(0) + 10(0)(1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the point (0, 1) is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & -3(-1) + 10(-1)(1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, the point (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Linearization fails to determine the stability of this point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is typically the stable or unstable manifold of a saddle point. We have identified a saddle point at (-1, 1). The separatrix will be an invariant curve (a trajectory) that passes through this point. To find the equation of this curve, we can analyze the differential equation for the trajectories in the phase plane:\n$$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$$\nWe look for a simple particular solution that could represent an invariant manifold. Let's test if a function of the form $d = k u^n$ is a solution. Through inspection or trial, let's test the curve $d = -u^2$.\n\nIf $d = -u^2$, then $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. Let's substitute $d=-u^2$ into the right side of the trajectory equation:\n$$ \\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4}{u^2(u-1)} $$\n$$ = \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u $$\nSince both sides of the equation are equal, $d = -u^2$ is indeed a solution curve (an invariant manifold) of the system.\n\nLet's check if this curve passes through any of the equilibrium points:\n*   For $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point **(-1, 1)**.\n*   For $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. The curve passes through the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\nThe invariant curve $d = -u^2$ connects the saddle point (-1, 1) to the equilibrium point (0, 0). This curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1), because trajectories on this curve move away from (-1, 1) as time increases (since for $0 < u < 1$, $u'(t) < 0$, causing $u$ to decrease from 1).\n\nThis invariant manifold acts as a separatrix. For initial conditions in the strip $0 < u < 1$, trajectories starting on one side of this curve will have a different long-term behavior than trajectories starting on the other side. Specifically, it separates the basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium at (0, 0) from the region of trajectories that escape to infinity.\n\nThus, the separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
