    "The specific Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is not publicly disclosed. The chemical name is the IUPAC designation for Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye known for its vibrant pink to reddish-violet color.\n\nCrayola's crayon ingredients are primarily paraffin wax and color pigments. However, the precise chemical composition of the pigments is a trade secret and not publicly released by the company. While some independent analyses of Crayola products have been conducted, they have focused on identifying harmful substances like heavy metals rather than detailing the specific organic pigments used.\n\nInterestingly, a patent for a \"colored bubbles\" product assigned to Crayola LLC lists \"Basic Violet 10,\" another name for Rhodamine B, as a potential dye. This indicates that Crayola has worked with this chemical for other products, but it does not confirm its use in their crayons.\n\nTherefore, without a public disclosure from Crayola or a detailed chemical analysis of their crayon pigments, it is not possible to definitively identify which crayon color, if any, contains Rhodamine B.\n\n<<<The information is not publicly available.>>>"
