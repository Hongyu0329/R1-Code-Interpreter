    "An American in Paris (1951) was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\nThe film features an extended ballet sequence that includes a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, the location of the Luxor Obelisk. This sequence was designed in the style of French painter Raoul Dufy. In the film, Gene Kelly's character dances around a set that suggests the famous square, including its iconic fountain.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners were filmed in or set in Paris, such as \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956) and \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937), there is no evidence that they depicted the Luxor Obelisk. The Paris scenes in \"Around the World in 80 Days\" primarily featured other landmarks and studio sets for key moments, such as the balloon departure. \"The Life of Emile Zola\" recreated various Parisian locations on studio sets, but the Place de la Concorde was not among those mentioned in detailed accounts of the film's production.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
