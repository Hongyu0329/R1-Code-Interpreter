    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first understand the principles governing coiled-coil formation, particularly the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of amino acid side chains.\n\n### Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization\n\nCoiled-coil structures are formed when two or more Î±-helices wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-residue repeating pattern known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are typically hydrophobic and pack together to form the core of the structure. This packing arrangement, termed \"knobs-into-holes,\" is a primary determinant of the coiled-coil's stability and its oligomeric state (the number of helices in the bundle).\n\nThe specific amino acids occupying the 'a' and 'd' positions have been shown to direct the formation of different oligomeric states. Landmark studies have established a set of rules based on the identity of these core residues:\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored when Isoleucine (I) is at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) is at the 'd' position.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored when Isoleucine (I) is present at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by the reverse arrangement of the dimer-forming sequence, with Leucine (L) at the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position.\n\n### Analysis of the Protein Sequence\n\nThe given sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. To analyze it, we must first identify the heptad repeat and determine which residues occupy the 'a' and 'd' positions. By aligning the sequence to maximize the placement of hydrophobic residues at the core positions, we can establish the correct register.\n\nLet's align the central 28 residues, which constitute four full heptads, and assign the `abcdefg` positions. A consistent hydrophobic pattern emerges if we assign the Isoleucine (I) at position 3 as a 'd' residue:\n\n**Sequence:** `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n**Register:**  `b c d e f g a | b c d e f g a | b c d e f g a | b c d e f g a`\n\nThis registration reveals a consistent pattern for the core positions of each heptad:\n*   **Heptad 1 (residues 1-7):** 'a' is Leucine (L) at position 7; 'd' is Isoleucine (I) at position 3.\n*   **Heptad 2 (residues 8-14):** 'a' is Leucine (L) at position 14; 'd' is Isoleucine (I) at position 10.\n*   **Heptad 3 (residues 15-21):** 'a' is Leucine (L) at position 21; 'd' is Isoleucine (I) at position 17.\n*   **Heptad 4 (residues 22-28):** 'a' is Leucine (L) at position 28; 'd' is Isoleucine (I) at position 24.\n\nThroughout the sequence, the 'a' positions are consistently occupied by Leucine (L) and the 'd' positions are consistently occupied by Isoleucine (I).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the established rules for coiled-coil oligomerization, a sequence with Leucine at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine at the 'd' positions favors the formation of a tetrameric structure. The specific shapes and packing preferences of the leucine and isoleucine side chains in this arrangement create a stable four-helix bundle.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
