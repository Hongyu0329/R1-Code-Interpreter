    "According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>, opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any period of time. Once an ampule is opened, it is considered an open system and must be used immediately. Any remaining contents must be discarded and cannot be stored for future use.\n\nThe National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) also states that no storage of an open ampule is permitted, and therefore, no beyond-use date (BUD) applies.\n\nIf a single-dose *vial* (not an ampule) is punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner air environment, it may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, provided storage requirements are met. However, for an ampule, the guidance is strict and does not permit any storage after opening.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must be used immediately, and no storage is permitted.>>>"
