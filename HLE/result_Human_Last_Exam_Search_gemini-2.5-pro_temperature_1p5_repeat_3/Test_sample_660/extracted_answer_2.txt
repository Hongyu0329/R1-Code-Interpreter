The set of values $\theta$ for which companies choose more lenient auditors is given by the condition $F(\theta) \ge t(\theta)$. For the truthful firm, $\theta=1$, it is indifferent, but a tie-breaking assumption leads it to choose a lenient auditor. For a firm engaged in malpractice, $\theta=0$, it will choose the lenient auditor if the penalty $F(0)$ is greater than or equal to its tax liability $t(0)$. More generally, for any level of truthfulness $\theta$, the firm will prefer a lenient auditor if $F(\theta) \ge t(\theta)$.
