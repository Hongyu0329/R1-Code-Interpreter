  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board.

    "To solve this problem with maximum memory efficiency, we need to avoid storing the entire input string. The best approach is to read the input character by character and use a counting sort algorithm, as the numbers are limited to a small range (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nThis method involves the following steps:\n1.  Declare an array, `counts`, to store the frequency of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4). To be memory efficient, we choose the smallest possible data type that can hold the maximum count. Since the input string is at most 1000 characters long, the maximum number of summands is (1000+1)/2 = 500. A `short` integer type, which typically uses 2 bytes and can store values up to 32,767, is sufficient.\n2.  Read the input one character at a time using `getchar()`. This avoids allocating a large buffer for the whole string. The variable storing the result of `getchar()` must be an `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` (End-of-File) value.\n3.  As we read each character, if it's a digit, we increment the corresponding counter in our `counts` array.\n4.  After counting, we iterate from 1 to 4. For each number, we print it as many times as it was counted, separated by `+` signs. A flag variable can be used to ensure `+` is only printed between numbers. To be efficient, this flag and any loop counters should also be declared with the smallest suitable data type, which is `char`.\n\n### C Program\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program rearranges the summands in a given sum so that they are in\n * non-decreasing order. The sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n *\n * This implementation is designed to be highly memory-efficient.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A 'short' is sufficient since the max count of any number is 500.\n    // Memory: 4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n    short counts[4] = {0}; \n    \n    // 'c' must be 'int' to correctly handle the EOF value from getchar().\n    // Memory: sizeof(int) = 4 bytes.\n    int c;\n    \n    // 'i' is a loop counter from 0 to 3, so 'char' is sufficient.\n    // Memory: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char i;\n    \n    // 'first' is a flag (0 or 1), so 'char' is sufficient.\n    // Memory: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char first = 1;\n    \n    // Read the input character by character until a newline or EOF.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Print the numbers in non-decreasing order.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        // This inner loop prints the number `counts[i]` times without a new variable.\n        while (counts[i] > 0) {\n            if (!first) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            putchar('1' + i);\n            first = 0;\n            counts[i]--;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    putchar('\\n');\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this program is calculated based on the typical sizes of data types in C on competitive programming platforms (like GCC on a 64-bit system):\n*   `short counts[4]`: The array to store frequencies. `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = 8 bytes.\n*   `int c`: The variable for `getchar()` return value. `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   `char i`: The loop counter. `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n*   `char first`: The flag for printing the `+` character. `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14 bytes.\n\n<<<14>>>"
