    "The reaction in question is between 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide, a Grignard reagent. Grignard reactions with aryl halides are a fundamental method for forming carbon-carbon bonds. The solvent, tetrahydrofuran (THF), is a typical choice for Grignar_d reactions.\n\nThe reactivity of halogens on an aromatic ring in reactions with Grignard reagents follows the order I > Br > Cl. In the starting material, 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, there are three halogen atoms attached to the benzene ring: an iodine at position 2 and two bromines at positions 1 and 3.\n\nGiven the reactivity trend, the iodine atom will react first with the phenyl magnesium bromide. Since the Grignard reagent is in excess, the reaction will not stop there. The bromine atoms will also be substituted by phenyl groups. This type of reaction, where a Grignard reagent couples with an organic halide, is a form of cross-coupling. While sometimes referred to generally as a Grignard reaction, it can proceed via mechanisms like the Kumada coupling, or through aryne intermediates, especially with polyhalogenated benzenes.\n\nThe stepwise substitution would be:\n1.  **Reaction at the C-I bond:** 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene reacts with one equivalent of phenyl magnesium bromide to form 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  **Reaction at the C-Br bonds:** Due to the excess of the Grignard reagent, the two bromine atoms in 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene will be subsequently replaced by phenyl groups.\n\nThe final organic product, after all three halogen atoms have been substituted by phenyl groups, is a benzene ring with three phenyl substituents at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. The aqueous work-up serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent and protonate any intermediates, yielding the final neutral product.\n\nThe IUPAC name for a benzene ring substituted with phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3 is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene. It is also known as *vic*-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
