    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four main colors: white, red, violet, and black.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that can appear yellowish due to impurities or degradation, which is why it is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus. However, pure white phosphorus is white.\n\nRed phosphorus is another common form and, as its name suggests, is red in color. It can be formed by heating white phosphorus. Upon further heating, red phosphorus can crystallize into violet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, which is a distinct violet or purple color.\n\nThe most stable allotrope of phosphorus is black phosphorus. It has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite. Other forms mentioned, such as diphosphorus, exist as a gas under specific conditions.\n\nTherefore, the distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are white, red, violet, and black.\n\n<<<4>>>"
