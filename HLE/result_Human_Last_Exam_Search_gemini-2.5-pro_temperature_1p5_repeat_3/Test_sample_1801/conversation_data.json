    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Kenneth Arrow.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, confirmed his participation in the \"Ask Why\" campaign and stated that he was paid a substantial fee. In one of the commercials, Gell-Mann is seen encouraging people to ask \"Why not?\".\n\nKenneth Arrow, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1972 for his pioneering contributions to general equilibrium theory and welfare theory, was also featured in the campaign. He, along with Gell-Mann, was part of a group of leading thinkers assembled by Enron for the campaign, which began in early 2000.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Kenneth Arrow>>>"
