    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nThe prime factorization of 53599 is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$ is primitive if and only if it can be expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo the prime $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (i.e., its order is greater than 1).\n\nIn our case, $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. A primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ is of the form $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where each $\\chi_p$ is a non-principal character modulo $p$.\n\n### 3. Condition on the Order\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$o(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o(\\chi_7), o(\\chi_{13}), o(\\chi_{19}), o(\\chi_{31}))$.\nWe require this order to be 6.\n\nFor the lcm of a set of integers to be 6, each integer in the set must be a divisor of 6. Therefore, the order of each component character $o(\\chi_p)$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal, their orders must be greater than 1. Thus, for each prime $p$, the order $o(\\chi_p)$ must be in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 4. Counting the Number of Component Characters\nThe number of characters modulo a prime $p$ of a specific order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nFor each of the prime factors of $d$:\n*   $p=7$: $p-1 = 6$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 6, we have characters of these orders.\n*   $p=13$: $p-1 = 12$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 12, we have characters of these orders.\n*   $p=19$: $p-1 = 18$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 18, we have characters of these orders.\n*   $p=31$: $p-1 = 30$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 30, we have characters of these orders.\n\nFor each of the four prime factors, the number of available non-principal characters with orders dividing 6 are:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each prime component, there are $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible choices for a character whose order is in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 5. Calculation using Inclusion-Exclusion\nLet $S_k$ be the set of primitive characters with conductor $d$ whose order divides $k$. We are looking for the number of characters with order exactly 6. This can be calculated as $|S_6| - |S_3| - |S_2|$, since a character with order dividing both 2 and 3 has an order that divides 1, and primitive characters cannot have order 1.\n\n*   **Total characters with order dividing 6 ($|S_6|$):**\n    For each of the four prime components, there are 5 choices of character.\n    Total number = $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n*   **Characters with order dividing 3 ($|S_3|$):**\n    For the order of $\\chi$ to divide 3, the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must divide 3. This means each $\\chi_p$ must have order 3. There are $\\phi(3) = 2$ such characters for each prime.\n    Total number = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Characters with order dividing 2 ($|S_2|$):**\n    For the order of $\\chi$ to divide 2, the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must divide 2. This means each $\\chi_p$ must have order 2. There is $\\phi(2) = 1$ such character for each prime.\n    Total number = $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\nThe number of characters with order exactly 6 is the total number of characters with order dividing 6, minus those with an order that strictly divides 6 (i.e., order 1, 2, or 3). As primitive characters can't have order 1, we subtract the counts for orders 2 and 3.\n\nNumber of order 6 characters = $|S_6| - |S_3| - |S_2| = 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
