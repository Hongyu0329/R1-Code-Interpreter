    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The prime 2 divides all coefficients (8 and 14) except the leading one, and $2^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Since the polynomial is irreducible and of degree 4, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders of the group are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Resolvent Cubic and its Discriminant\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is given by the formula $y^3 - 4ry + q^2$. For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$, so the resolvent cubic is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y + 8^2 = y^3 - 56y + 64$.\n\nThe discriminant of the quartic polynomial is the same as the discriminant of its resolvent cubic. For a cubic $y^3 + Ay + B$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -4A^3 - 27B^2$. Here, $A=-56$ and $B=64$.\n$\\Delta = -4(-56)^3 - 27(64)^2 = -4(-175616) - 27(4096) = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Discriminant\nThe Galois group of a polynomial is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. Since $\\sqrt{591872}$ is not an integer, the discriminant is not a perfect square. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates the possibilities of the group being $A_4$ (order 12) or the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4). The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Reducibility of the Resolvent Cubic\nWe check if the resolvent cubic $R(y) = y^3 - 56y + 64$ has rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing these divisors, we find that $y=-8$ is a root:\n$R(-8) = (-8)^3 - 56(-8) + 64 = -512 + 448 + 64 = 0$.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the Galois group is not $S_4$. The only remaining possibilities are $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 5: Distinguishing Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nWhen the resolvent cubic of an irreducible quartic $x^4+qx+r$ has exactly one rational root $\\theta$, a criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ is to check if the quantity $\\theta^2 - 4r$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is a square, the group is $C_4$; otherwise, it is $D_4$.\n\nFor our polynomial, the rational root of the resolvent is $\\theta = -8$ and the constant term is $r=14$. We compute:\n$\\theta^2 - 4r = (-8)^2 - 4(14) = 64 - 56 = 8$.\n\nThe number 8 is not a perfect square in the rational numbers. Therefore, the Galois group of the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the dihedral group $D_4$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Galois group is the dihedral group $D_4$, which has an order of 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
