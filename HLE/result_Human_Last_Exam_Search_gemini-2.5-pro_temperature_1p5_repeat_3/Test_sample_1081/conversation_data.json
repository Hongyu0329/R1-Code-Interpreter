    "A reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is always a split group. This is because the Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that there are no non-split (twisted) forms of $E_8$ over a finite field.\n\nFor a split reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group, $W(G)$.\n\nIn the case of a group of type $E_8$, the relevant Weyl group is $W(E_8)$. The order of this group is $696,729,600$. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed and is a known result in the theory of reflection groups.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112. Therefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n"
