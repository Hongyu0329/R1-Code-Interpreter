    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is not readily identifiable through available search resources. Despite extensive searches for this specific scene, no film matching the complete description could be found.\n\nThere are several Oscar-nominated films with pivotal bus scenes, such as *It Happened One Night* and the more recent nominee *Close*. The film *Heart and Souls* features a fatal bus crash that sets the premise for the entire movie. Additionally, the film *Into the Wild*, based on a true story, involves a significant bus setting where the protagonist ultimately dies, and his final written words include \"THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL!\". However, none of these films contain the specific sequence of a character saying \"Thank you\" upon boarding a bus, which then directly leads to a fatal outcome.\n\nLists of famous last words in films and discussions about characters' deaths in movies also do not include this particular scenario. It is possible that the user may be conflating details from different films or misremembering a specific element of the scene.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify the film based on the provided details.>>>"
