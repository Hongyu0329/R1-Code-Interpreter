    "To solve this problem, we must identify the rule for an elementary cellular automaton that generates the given three-generation sequence. An elementary cellular automaton has 256 possible rules, numbered 0 to 255. The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its left and right neighbors. This problem assumes a finite automaton of 8 cells with periodic boundary conditions, meaning the grid wraps around.\n\nThe given sequence is:\n*   Generation 1: `01101001`\n*   Generation 2: `????????` (the unknown intermediate step)\n*   Generation 3: `10000111`\n\nThe solution involves testing each of the 256 rules. For each rule, we first apply it to Generation 1 to produce a candidate for Generation 2. Then, we apply the same rule to this candidate Generation 2. If the result matches the given Generation 3, we have found the correct rule and the corresponding intermediate step.\n\nThis process reveals that **Rule 150** is the only rule that satisfies the conditions. The binary representation of Rule 150 is `10010110`. This rule is also known for being a linear rule, meaning its evolution can be described by the XOR sum of its neighbors.\n\nLet's trace the evolution using Rule 150:\n\n1.  **From Generation 1 to Generation 2:**\n    *   Initial state (G1): `01101001`\n    *   Applying Rule 150 to G1 yields the intermediate step (G2): `11011111`\n\n2.  **From Generation 2 to Generation 3:**\n    *   Intermediate state (G2): `11011111`\n    *   Applying Rule 150 to G2 yields the final state (G3): `10000111`, which matches the given sequence.\n\nTherefore, the unique valid solution for the intermediate step is `11011111`.\n\n<<<11011111>>>"
