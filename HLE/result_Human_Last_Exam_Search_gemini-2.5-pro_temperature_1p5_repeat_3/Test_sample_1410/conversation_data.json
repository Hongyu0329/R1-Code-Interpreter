    "Assuming optimal play from both sides, White can win in 4 moves.\n\nThe winning sequence begins with the move `1. Qxf7+`. After Black's forced response of `1... Kh8`, White continues with `2. Rxe1`. Black's best defense is `2... R8e7`, to which White responds with `3. Qf8+`. Black is forced to capture with `3... Rxf8`, which is then followed by the final move `4. Rxf8#`, resulting in a checkmate.\n\n<<<4>>>"
