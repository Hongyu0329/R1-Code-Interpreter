    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`, we must first identify all valid syntactic forms of length five and then count how many of them evaluate to true. The operator precedence is given as `!` > `&` > `|`.\n\nHere is a systematic breakdown of the possible valid expression structures and the number of true expressions for each:\n\n### 1. Expressions with Three Operands\nThis structure is of the form `A op1 B op2 C`, where `A`, `B`, and `C` are variables for `T` or `F`, and `op1` and `op2` are the binary operators `&` or `|`. Due to operator precedence, some forms are evaluated with parentheses, such as `A | B & C` being parsed as `A | (B & C)`.\n*   `A & B & C`: Only one combination, `T & T & T`, is true. (1 true expression)\n*   `A | B | C`: All combinations except `F | F | F` are true. (7 true expressions)\n*   `A & B | C`: This is parsed as `(A & B) | C`. Five combinations are true (`T&T|T`, `T&T|F`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T`). (5 true expressions)\n*   `A | B & C`: This is parsed as `A | (B & C)`. Five combinations are true (`T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, `F|T&T`). (5 true expressions)\n**Total for this category: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18**\n\n### 2. Expressions with Parentheses Around a Binary Operation\nThis structure is of the form `(A op B)`, using 5 symbols.\n*   `(A & B)`: Only `(T & T)` is true. (1 true expression)\n*   `(A | B)`: Three combinations are true: `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, and `(F | T)`. (3 true expressions)\n**Total for this category: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n### 3. Expressions with Nested Parentheses\nThis structure takes the form `((A))`.\n*   `((T))`: This evaluates to true. (1 true expression)\n*   `((F))`: This evaluates to false.\n**Total for this category: 1**\n\n### 4. Expressions with Mixed Parentheses and Operators\nThese structures involve parentheses around a single operand, like `A op (B)` or `(A) op B`.\n*   `A op (B)`:\n    *   `T & (T)` is true. (1 true expression)\n    *   `T | (T)`, `T | (F)`, and `F | (T)` are true. (3 true expressions)\n*   `(A) op B`:\n    *   `(T) & T` is true. (1 true expression)\n    *   `(T) | T`, `(T) | F`, and `(F) | T` are true. (3 true expressions)\n**Total for this category: (1+3) + (1+3) = 8**\n\n### 5. Expressions Involving the NOT Operator `!`\nThese expressions are five symbols long and include one or more negation operators.\n*   **Chained Negations**:\n    *   `!!!!A`: The expression `!!!!T` is true. (1 true expression)\n    *   `!!(A)`: The expression `!!(T)` is true. (1 true expression)\n*   **Negations with Binary Operators**:\n    *   `!!A op B`: `!!T&T` is true. `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, and `!!F|T` are also true. (4 true expressions)\n    *   `A op !!B`: Symmetrically, these are `T&!!T` and `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`. (4 true expressions)\n    *   `!A op !B`: `!F&!F` is true. `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, and `!F|!F` are also true. (4 true expressions)\n**Total for this category: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14**\n\n### Final Count\nSumming the counts from all valid structures gives the total number of true boolean expressions of length five:\n18 (three operands) + 4 (parenthesized binary op) + 1 (nested parentheses) + 8 (mixed parentheses) + 14 (with NOT operator) = 45.\n\n<<<45>>>"
