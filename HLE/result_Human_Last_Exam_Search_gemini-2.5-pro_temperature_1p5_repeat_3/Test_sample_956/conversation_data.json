    "The group $G$ is generated by the given permutations acting on the set $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$. Let's relabel the elements $x, y, z$ as $10, 11, 12$ respectively for convenience. The generators are:\n*   $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, 11, 10)$\n*   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, 10, 7, 6)$\n*   $c = (1, 2)(3, 12)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, 11)(9, 10)$\n\nThe group $G$ generated by these permutations is the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. This is one of the 26 sporadic simple groups.\n\nThe Schur multiplier of a group $G$, denoted $M(G)$, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. For the Mathieu group $M_{12}$, the Schur multiplier is the cyclic group of order 2, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Therefore, $A = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nWe need to find the number of proper subgroups of $A = \\mathbb{Z}_2$, up to isomorphism. The subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ are the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$ and the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ itself. A proper subgroup of a group is a subgroup that is not equal to the group itself.\n\nThe only proper subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$. Thus, there is only one proper subgroup. These subgroups are distinct, so there is only 1 proper subgroup up to isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 proper subgroup of $A = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n<<<1>>>"
