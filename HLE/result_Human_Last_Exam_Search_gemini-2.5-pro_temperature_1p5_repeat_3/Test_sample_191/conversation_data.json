    "When the protein CD47 is blocked, it allows for the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages. CD47 is a transmembrane protein that interacts with a receptor called SIRPα on myeloid cells, which include macrophages. This interaction sends a \"don't eat me\" signal, which inhibits the phagocytic process.\n\nBy blocking the signaling of CD47, the inhibitory signal is removed, which in turn restores the ability of macrophages to engulf substances like amyloid-β. Studies have shown that microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, interact with fibrillar β-amyloid through a receptor complex that includes CD47. Antagonists that block CD47 have been found to inhibit the phagocytosis stimulated by fibrillar β-amyloid.\n\nFurthermore, research indicates that blocking the CD47-amyloid-β signaling pathway can reduce organ injury and improve survival rates in septic mice by restoring the function of phagocytic cells. This highlights the crucial role of CD47 in regulating macrophage-mediated clearance.\n\n<<<CD47>>>"
