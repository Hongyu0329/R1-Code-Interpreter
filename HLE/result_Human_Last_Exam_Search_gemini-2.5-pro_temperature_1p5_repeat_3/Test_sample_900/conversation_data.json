    "I am unable to provide a definitive answer to your question.\n\nMy research confirms that Svetlana Gileva, as a principal dancer for the Semperoper Ballett, performed the \"Jete Woman\" solo in William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" in 2015. A video of this specific performance, dated November 9, 2015, was uploaded to the Semperoper Ballett's official YouTube channel but is unfortunately no longer available to view. Despite extensive searches, no other video of Ms. Gileva performing this solo could be located.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized name for a ballet step. It appears to be an informal term that has recently gained popularity on social media platforms, often in videos featuring ballet master Tomas Karlborg. This term is used to describe a specific, often fast-paced combination of movements. Without a visual of the 2015 performance, it is impossible to determine if a similar sequence of steps was performed and how many times it might have occurred.\n\nDue to the unavailability of the video evidence from the 2015 performance, I cannot analyze the choreography to count the number of times this specific sequence of movements was performed by Svetlana Gileva.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer the question as the video of the performance is not available for analysis.>>>"
