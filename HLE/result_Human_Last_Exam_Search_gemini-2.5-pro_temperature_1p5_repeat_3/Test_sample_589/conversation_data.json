    "Based on the information available, there is no major Hollywood feature film that contains the specific scene of a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nExtensive searches have been conducted to identify such a film, including looking into movies known for featuring bicycles, coming-of-age stories, and specific \"playing chicken\" scenes. While several films feature prominent bicycle scenes, such as \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"Back to the Future,\" none contain the precise sequence of events described.\n\nThreads on community forums like Reddit also contain discussions about movies with similar themes, but none match the exact details of a teenager on a pink bike in a direct confrontation with a car. The search results did not yield a definitive match for this particularly memorable and specific scene. It is possible that the scene is from a lesser-known film, a foreign film, a television show, or that the details have been misremembered.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify the film based on the information provided.>>>"
