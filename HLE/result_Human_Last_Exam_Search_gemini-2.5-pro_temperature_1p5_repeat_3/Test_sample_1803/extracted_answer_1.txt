The ground state energy shift $\Delta E_0$ is calculated using second-order perturbation theory on the dipole-dipole interaction potential between the two oscillators. The leading term in the separation distance $R$ is the van der Waals interaction.

1.  **Interaction Potential**: The Coulomb interaction between the charges of the two oscillators, which are separated by a large distance $R$, can be approximated by a dipole-dipole interaction. The dipole moment of each oscillator is $\vec{p}_i = e\vec{x}_i$, where $\vec{x}_i$ is the displacement of the charges. The interaction Hamiltonian is:
    $V_{int} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0 R^3} \left[ \vec{p}_1 \cdot \vec{p}_2 - 3(\vec{p}_1 \cdot \hat{R})(\vec{p}_2 \cdot \hat{R}) \right]$
    Assuming the vector $\vec{R}$ is along the z-axis, this simplifies to:
