    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a derivative of triphenylene, specifically 2,6,10-triethynyltriphenylene. The core of this molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon composed of four fused benzene rings.\n\nTriphenylene is a planar molecule and possesses a high degree of symmetry, belonging to the D3h point group. This high symmetry is a key characteristic of its structure. The given SMILES string indicates that three ethynyl (C#C) groups are attached to the triphenylene core at positions 2, 6, and 10. This substitution pattern maintains the threefold rotational symmetry and the planarity of the parent molecule.\n\nThe symmetry elements of 2,6,10-triethynyltriphenylene are:\n*   A principal C3 axis of rotation perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n*   Three C2 axes of rotation lying within the molecular plane.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n\nThe presence of these symmetry elements confirms that the molecule belongs to the D3h point group.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
