    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\nWe can use the method of forming a compound matrix and reducing it to its row-echelon form using elementary row operations. The non-zero rows of the reduced matrix will form a GCRD.\n\nFirst, construct the compound matrix P by stacking P1 and P2:\nP =\n[s^2 + s,  -s]\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n[s,        0]\n[-s - 1,   1]\n\nLet the rows be R1, R2, R3, and R4.\nR1 = [s^2 + s, -s]\nR2 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\nR3 = [s, 0]\nR4 = [-s - 1, 1]\n\nWe perform elementary row operations with polynomial coefficients to simplify the matrix.\nNotice that the first row, R1, can be expressed as a polynomial multiple of the fourth row, R4.\nSpecifically, `R1 = -s * R4`:\n-s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s, -s], which is exactly R1.\n\nThis means that R1 is linearly dependent on R4 over the ring of polynomials, so we can replace R1 with a zero row through the operation `R1_new = R1 + s * R4`:\nR1_new = [s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] =\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n[0,        0]\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n[s,        0]\n[-s - 1,   1]\n\nThe GCRD can now be found from the remaining non-zero rows. Let's call them r1, r2, and r3:\nr1 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\nr2 = [s, 0]\nr3 = [-s - 1, 1]\n\nNow, we continue the row reduction on this 3x2 matrix. Let's use r2 to simplify r1.\nPerform the operation `r1_new = r1 + s * r2`:\nr1_new = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s * [s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2]\n\nThe set of rows is now:\n[-1, s^2]\n[s, 0]\n[-s - 1, 1]\n\nLet's use the new first row `r1_new = [-1, s^2]` to simplify the other rows.\nPerform `r2_new = r2 + s * r1_new`:\nr2_new = [s, 0] + s * [-1, s^2] = [s - s, 0 + s^3] = [0, s^3]\nPerform `r3_new = r3 - r1_new`:\nr3_new = [-s - 1, 1] - [-1, s^2] = [-s - 1 + 1, 1 - s^2] = [-s, 1 - s^2]\n\nThe matrix of rows is now:\n[-1, s^2]\n[0, s^3]\n[-s, 1 - s^2]\n\nUse the first row to simplify the third row. Perform `r3_new' = r3_new - s * r1_new`:\nr3_new' = [-s, 1 - s^2] - s * [-1, s^2] = [-s + s, 1 - s^2 - s^3] = [0, 1 - s^2 - s^3]\n\nThe set of rows becomes:\n[-1, s^2]\n[0, s^3]\n[0, 1 - s^2 - s^3]\n\nNow we have two rows that start with 0. We can apply the Euclidean algorithm to the polynomial entries in the second column (`s^3` and `1 - s^2 - s^3`). The greatest common divisor of these two polynomials is 1. This means we can find a linear combination of these two rows with polynomial coefficients that results in the row `[0, 1]`.\n\nSo, the row space is generated by:\n[-1, s^2]\n\n\nFinally, we use the new second row `[0, 1]` to simplify the first row. Perform `r1_final = r1 - s^2 * r2`:\nr1_final = [-1, s^2] - s^2 * = [-1, s^2 - s^2] = [-1, 0]\n\nThe resulting basis for the row space is:\n[-1, 0]\n\n\nBy multiplying the first row by -1, we obtain the identity matrix:\n\n\n\nSince the row-reduced form of the compound matrix is the identity matrix `I`, the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the identity matrix. This also implies that P1 and P2 are relatively right prime.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
