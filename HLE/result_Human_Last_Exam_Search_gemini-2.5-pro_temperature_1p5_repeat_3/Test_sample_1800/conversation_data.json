    "Determining an ideal Nickel to Cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is complex as the optimal composition is highly dependent on the specific chemical reaction it is intended to catalyze. Research indicates that the ratios that maximize catalytic performance for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction differ from those ideal for water splitting.\n\n### **Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction**\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which involves reacting carbon monoxide with water to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, a relatively low nickel content appears to be most effective.\n\nStudies on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts show that nickel content in the range of **5 to 12.5 wt%** results in high CO conversion rates, particularly between 300-450 °C. Specifically, CO conversion at 400 °C for catalysts with 10 wt% and 12.5 wt% Ni were found to be nearly identical and highly effective at 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively. Other research on lanthanum-doped ceria supports indicates that an optimal Ni proportion is around **7% molar** for the reverse WGS reaction. Furthermore, even small additions of Ni, such as 5 atomic % (at. %), have been shown to significantly enhance the WGS reaction activity of ceria-based catalysts.\n\n### **Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for Water Splitting**\n\nIn contrast, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting, the process of dissociating water into hydrogen and oxygen, generally favors a higher nickel content. The optimal ratio can also vary depending on which half-reaction is being targeted: the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) or the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).\n\n*   **For the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):** Research on Ni<sub>y</sub>Ce<sub>100−y</sub>O<sub>x</sub> electrocatalysts has shown that those with a higher nickel content, specifically **Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ) and 1:1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ)**, exhibit superior performance with larger electrochemically active surface areas.\n\n*   **For the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):** A study utilizing Ni₃N-CeO₂ nanoparticles found that a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (equivalent to a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5)** provided the optimal performance for the HER.\n\n*   **For Overall Water Splitting:** Computational analysis suggests that Ni-Ceria nanoparticles with a **3Ni/1Ce ratio** exhibit more favorable adsorption energy and, consequently, better catalytic properties for the water-splitting reaction.\n\nIn summary, there is no single Ni/Ce ratio that is optimal for both the WGS reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, a lower nickel concentration, typically in the range of 7-12.5 wt%, is preferred. For water splitting, a higher nickel content is generally more advantageous, with optimal atomic ratios ranging from 1:1 to 3:1, depending on the specific half-reaction.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is reaction-dependent. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is approximately 7-12.5 wt% Ni. For water splitting, a higher content of nickel is generally better, with ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratios ranging from 1:1 to 3:1.>>>"
