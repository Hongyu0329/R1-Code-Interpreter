(a) Diversity Order:**
*   The diversity order for code **S**<sub>a</sub> is **1**.
*   The diversity order for code **S**<sub>b</sub> is **1**.
*   The diversity order for code **S**<sub>c</sub> is **2**.

**(b) Maximum Directivity:**
Code **S**<sub>c</sub> provides the maximum directivity. It achieves the full diversity order of 2 and is an orthogonal code, which ensures a good coding gain and optimal performance among the given codes.
