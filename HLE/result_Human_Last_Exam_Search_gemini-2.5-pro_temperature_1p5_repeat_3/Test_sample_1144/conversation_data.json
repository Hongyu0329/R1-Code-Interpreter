    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will perform the following calculations:\n\n**1. Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p):**\n\nAccording to Bohr's model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in a given orbit is quantized and is given by the formula:\nL = n * h / (2π)\nwhere:\n*   n is the principal quantum number (for the first orbit, n=1)\n*   h is Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n\nThe angular momentum is also defined as L = p * r, where 'p' is the linear momentum and 'r' is the radius of the orbit. For the first Bohr orbit, the radius 'r' is the Bohr radius (a₀), which is approximately 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\nTherefore, the momentum 'p' can be calculated as:\np = (n * h) / (2 * π * r)\nFor the first orbit (n=1):\np = h / (2 * π * a₀)\n\n**2. Calculate the uncertainty in the momentum (Δp):**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is at least h / (4π). The formula is:\nΔx * Δp ≥ h / (4π)\n\nA more precise form uses the reduced Planck's constant, ħ = h / 2π, where the principle is stated as Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in position (Δx) is 10 pm (10 x 10⁻¹² m), we can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\nΔp ≈ h / (4 * π * Δx)\n\n**3. Calculate the ratio (Δp / p):**\n\nNow, we can find the desired ratio by dividing the uncertainty in momentum by the momentum:\nRatio = [h / (4 * π * Δx)] / [h / (2 * π * a₀)]\nRatio = (h / (4 * π * Δx)) * ((2 * π * a₀) / h)\nRatio = (2 * π * a₀) / (4 * π * Δx)\nRatio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n*   a₀ ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n*   Δx = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n\nRatio = (5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹) / (2 * 10 x 10⁻¹²)\nRatio = (5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹) / (2 x 10⁻¹¹)\nRatio ≈ 2.645885\n\n<<<2.646>>>"
