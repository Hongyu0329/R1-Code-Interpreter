    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nThis can be understood by considering the definitions of the terms involved:\n*   The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $G(3, 5)$.\n*   The integral cohomology ring is the set of cohomology groups $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ for all $k$, equipped with a ring structure given by the cup product. The entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of these groups: $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_k H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   A finitely generated abelian group, such as each $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, can be decomposed into a free part and a torsion part: $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T$. The integer $r$ is the rank of the group, and $T$ is its torsion subgroup.\n*   The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group $H^k$.\n*   A torsion group is a group where every element has a finite order. By definition, the rank of any torsion group is 0. This is because the rank of a group $A$ can be defined as the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$, which is the zero vector space for any torsion group.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific structure of the torsion subgroup, its rank is always 0.\n\nFor additional context, the additive structure of the integral cohomology groups of $G(3, 5)$ has been computed. The torsion part of the cohomology ring of a real Grassmannian consists entirely of 2-torsion (elements of order 2) and in some cases 4-torsion. For the specific case of $G(3, 5)$, which is homeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$, the torsion subgroup is non-trivial. The additive structure is as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^2(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^6(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of these groups, which is $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. As this is a torsion group, its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
