    "The \"outer-hull\" of a non-convex polyhedron, such as the great icosahedron, refers to the boundary of its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 equilateral triangular faces. Since the faces of the outer-hull are already triangles, no further triangulation is required. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to form the outer-hull is the number of faces of the regular icosahedron.\n\nThe number of faces of a regular icosahedron is 20. Each of these faces is a triangle.\n\nWhile the great icosahedron itself has 20 intersecting triangular faces, and the visible portions of these faces from the outside form 180 smaller triangles called \"facelets\", the question specifically asks for the triangulation of the *outer-hull*. The outer-hull is a simpler, convex shape.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
