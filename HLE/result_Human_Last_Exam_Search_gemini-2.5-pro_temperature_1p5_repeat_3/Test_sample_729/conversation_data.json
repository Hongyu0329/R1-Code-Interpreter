    "In the context of group theory, the term \"power subgroup\" most formally refers to the subgroup generated by the *k*-th powers of all elements in a group G for a given integer *k*. This is often denoted as G<sup>k</sup>.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, is a non-abelian group with a specific structure. It can be generated by two elements, 'a' and 'x', with the relations: a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², and xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹.\n\nTo find the number of distinct power subgroups of Q_128, we analyze the subgroups generated by the k-th powers of its elements for various integers k. The elements of Q_128 consist of powers of 'a' and elements of the form aⁱx.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups of Q_128 are as follows:\n*   **G¹ = Q_128**: The subgroup generated by the 1st power of all elements is the group itself.\n*   **G² = ⟨a²⟩**: The squares of the elements of the form aⁱ are a²ⁱ, and the square of any element aⁱx is a³². The subgroup generated by all these squares is the cyclic subgroup ⟨a²⟩ of order 32.\n*   **G⁴ = ⟨a⁴⟩**: The 4th powers of elements aⁱ are a⁴ⁱ, and for elements aⁱx, their 4th power is the identity element (1). This generates the cyclic subgroup ⟨a⁴⟩ of order 16.\n*   **G⁸ = ⟨a⁸⟩**: Similarly, this forms the cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n*   **G¹⁶ = ⟨a¹⁶⟩**: This forms the cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   **G³² = ⟨a³²⟩**: This forms the cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n*   **G⁶⁴ = {1}**: The 64th power of any element is the identity, resulting in the trivial subgroup.\n\nFor any odd integer *k*, the power subgroup Gᵏ is equal to the entire group Q_128. For any even integer *k*, the resulting power subgroup will be one of the subgroups listed above. Therefore, there are a total of 7 distinct power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\nIt is worth noting that if \"power subgroups\" were interpreted informally to mean \"cyclic subgroups\" (subgroups generated by a single element), the count would be different. In that case, there are 7 cyclic subgroups generated by the powers of 'a' and 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by the elements of the form aⁱx, for a total of 39 cyclic subgroups. However, the standard definition of a power subgroup leads to the answer of 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
