    "The Néron-Severi group, denoted NS(V) for a variety V, is the group of divisors modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank is known as the Picard number, ρ(V). To determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C (denoted C^(15)), we can use its relationship with the Jacobian variety of C, J(C).\n\n### Relationship between NS(C^(15)) and NS(J(C))\n\nFor a smooth projective curve C of genus *g*, and its *d*-th symmetric power C^(d), there is a well-established relationship between their Picard groups when *d* ≥ *g*. In this case, *g*=3 and *d*=15, so the condition is satisfied. The Picard group of C^(d) is isomorphic to the direct sum of the integers (representing the class of a certain divisor) and the Picard group of the Jacobian of C.\n\nThis isomorphism leads to a direct relationship between the ranks of their Néron-Severi groups:\nρ(C^(d)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve occurs when the curve *C* is \"generic\". For a generic curve, its Jacobian J(C) is a simple abelian variety, meaning it is not isogenous to a product of lower-dimensional abelian varieties. Furthermore, its ring of endomorphisms is simply the integers, End(J(C)) = ℤ.\n\nIn this case, the Néron-Severi group NS(J(C)) is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1.\n\nThus, the minimum rank for NS(J(C)) is:\nρ_min(J(C)) = 1\n\nThis leads to the smallest possible rank for NS(X):\nρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension *g* is bounded by the Hodge number h^(1,1), which is equal to g^2. For a Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, the dimension *g* is 3, so the maximum possible rank is 3^2 = 9.\n\nThis maximum is achieved for specific curves whose Jacobians have a large endomorphism algebra, a property known as complex multiplication (CM). An abelian variety that reaches this maximum rank is sometimes called \"ρ-maximal\" or \"singular\". For a Jacobian J(C) to have ρ(J(C)) = 9, it must be isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (E³), where E is a CM elliptic curve.\n\nAn example of a genus 3 curve with such a Jacobian is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ = 1. The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve y² = x³ - x, which has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers ℤ[i].\n\nThus, the maximum rank for NS(J(C)) is:\nρ_max(J(C)) = 9\n\nThis leads to the largest possible rank for NS(X):\nρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
