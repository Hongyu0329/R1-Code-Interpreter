    "The reaction between 1,3-butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a type of pericyclic reaction called a Diels-Alder reaction. This specific type of reaction, known as a [4+2] cycloaddition, occurs between a conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene) and a dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) to form a six-membered ring.\n\nThe product of this reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nIn this reaction:\n*   The four pi electrons from the conjugated diene and two pi electrons from the dienophile rearrange to form a new cyclohexene ring.\n*   Two new single bonds (sigma bonds) are formed at the expense of two existing double bonds (pi bonds).\n*   One new double bond is created in the resulting ring.\n\nThe diene, 1,3-butadiene, must be in the s-cis conformation for the reaction to occur. The substituents from the dienophile (two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms) remain attached to the same carbon atoms in the product. While some highly fluorinated or chlorinated reactants can lead to different reaction pathways like [2+2] cycloadditions, the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene typically proceeds as a standard Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
