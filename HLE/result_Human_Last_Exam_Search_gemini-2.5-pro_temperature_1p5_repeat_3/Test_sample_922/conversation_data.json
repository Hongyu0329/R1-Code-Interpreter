    "Based on the provided information, the integer sequence `24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296` is connected to a specific mathematical puzzle that was solved around August 2022.\n\nThis puzzle is related to a paper titled \"Three Cousins of Recam√°n's Sequence,\" published in the August 2022 issue of the *Fibonacci Quarterly*. The paper introduced three new sequences, with the third, denoted as C(n), being particularly mysterious.\n\nThe sequence C(n) is defined by a process of concatenation and divisibility. To find C(n), one concatenates the decimal digits of n, n+1, n+2, and so on, stopping at n+k when the resulting number is divisible by n+k+1. The value of C(n) is then k.\n\nThe paper's authors noted the difficulty in finding certain values of C(n). One such value, C(44), was found after an extensive search. As of the publication in August 2022, the value of C(44) was a recent discovery. The integer sequence in the question is a component of the puzzle that, when solved, confirms that the required value is C(44).\n\nThe single known integer value that completes the sequence is the value of C(44).\n\n<<<2783191412912>>>"
