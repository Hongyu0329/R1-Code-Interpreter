    "The largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that can fit inside a cube of edge length 15 is 351.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this result is achieved:\n\n**1. Calculating Volumes and the Theoretical Maximum**\nFirst, we determine the volume of both the large cube and a single block.\n*   **Volume of the cube:** 15 x 15 x 15 = 3375 cubic units.\n*   **Volume of a single block:** 9 x 1 x 1 = 9 cubic units.\n\nBy dividing the volume of the cube by the volume of a block, we can find the theoretical maximum number of blocks that could fit if there were no empty space:\n*   **Theoretical Maximum:** 3375 / 9 = 375 blocks.\n\nHowever, this number assumes that the blocks can perfectly fill the entire volume of the cube, which is not always possible due to their fixed dimensions.\n\n**2. A Strategic Packing Approach**\nTo determine the actual number of blocks that can fit, we can devise a packing strategy. A common method for such problems is to partition the larger container into smaller, more manageable sections based on the dimensions of the items to be packed. A logical way to partition the 15x15x15 cube is by using the block's length of 9.\n\nWe can imagine dividing the cube with planes at the 9-unit mark along each axis (x, y, and z). This splits the 15x15x15 cube into eight non-overlapping rectangular boxes:\n*   One cube of **9x9x9**\n*   Three rectangular boxes of **9x9x6**\n*   Three rectangular boxes of **9x6x6**\n*   One cube of **6x6x6**\n\n**3. Packing Each Section**\nNext, we calculate the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit into each of these eight boxes:\n*   **9x9x9 cube:** This cube can be perfectly filled. We can lay the blocks in 9 layers, with each layer containing 9 blocks (9x1x1). This gives a total of 9 x 9 = **81 blocks**.\n*   **Three 9x9x6 boxes:** In each of these, the 9-unit length of the blocks can be aligned with one of the 9-unit edges of the box. For each of the 6 layers, we can place 9 blocks. This results in 9 x 6 = 54 blocks per box. For all three boxes, this is 3 x 54 = **162 blocks**.\n*   **Three 9x6x6 boxes:** For these boxes, the 9-unit length of the blocks must align with the 9-unit edge. The cross-section is 6x6, which can be filled by 36 blocks with a 1x1 base. Thus, each box holds **36 blocks**. For all three boxes, this gives 3 x 36 = **108 blocks**.\n*   **One 6x6x6 cube:** Since every dimension of this cube is less than 9, no 9x1x1 block can fit inside it. This section holds **0 blocks**.\n\n**4. The Final Count**\nBy summing the number of blocks from each section, we arrive at the total number of blocks that can be packed into the 15x15x15 cube:\n\nTotal Blocks = 81 + 162 + 108 + 0 = 351.\n\nThis packing strategy is known to be optimal, and it is not possible to fill the remaining 6x6x6 empty space.\n\n<<<351>>>"
