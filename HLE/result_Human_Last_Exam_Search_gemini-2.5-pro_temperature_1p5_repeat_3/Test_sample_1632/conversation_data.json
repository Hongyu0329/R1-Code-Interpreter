    "A self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" is commonly used to refer to a square lattice or grid, where movements are restricted to four directions (north, south, east, and west), resembling the grid-like street layout of Manhattan.\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), has been calculated for various values of n. For a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a square lattice, the value of a(10) is 44,100. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A001411.\n\nThe number of self-avoiding walks for the first few steps on a square lattice are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\nIt is worth noting that some specialized literature defines a \"Manhattan lattice\" as a directed graph embedded on a square grid, which has different properties. However, in the absence of such specific context, the standard square lattice is the conventional interpretation.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
