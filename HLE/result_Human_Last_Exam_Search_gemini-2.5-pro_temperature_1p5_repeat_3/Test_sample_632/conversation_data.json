    "**No record of a unique architectural feature being removed from Rome's Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 has been found.**\n\nHistorical accounts of the famous square, which fronts the Pantheon, detail several significant architectural changes over the centuries, but none point to a removal of a distinct feature in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe most notable alterations to the Piazza della Rotonda include:\n*   In the 15th century, medieval sheds and small shops that had accumulated around the Pantheon's columns were cleared by order of Pope Eugenius IV to create the open space seen today.\n*   A fountain, the Fontana del Pantheon, was constructed in the center of the piazza in 1575 under the direction of Giacomo della Porta.\n*   In 1711, an ancient Egyptian obelisk was added to the center of the fountain by order of Pope Clement XI.\n*   Two bell towers, often derisively called \"the ass's ears,\" were added to the Pantheon in 1628 and were later demolished in 1883.\n*   Various other structures adjoining the square were also demolished in the 19th century to enlarge the piazza.\n\nExtensive searches for any architectural removal or demolition in or around 1950 in the Piazza della Rotonda have yielded no specific event. It is possible the user's query may be based on incorrect information regarding the date of a removal.\n\n<<<Based on the available information, no unique architectural feature was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.>>>"
