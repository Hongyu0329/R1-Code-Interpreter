    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system with spatial dimension d=3, as calculated by the epsilon (ϵ) expansion near the upper critical dimension, is approximately **0.167** to the first order in ϵ.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n**1. The Specific Heat Exponent α**\n\nIn the vicinity of a continuous phase transition, the specific heat, *C*, of a system exhibits a power-law dependence on the reduced temperature, *t* = (T - T<sub>c</sub>)/T<sub>c</sub>, where T<sub>c</sub> is the critical temperature. This relationship is defined by the critical exponent α:\n\n*C* ∝ |*t*|<sup>-α</sup>\n\nA positive value of α indicates a divergence in the specific heat as the system approaches the critical temperature.\n\n**2. The Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion**\n\nThe epsilon expansion is a powerful technique within renormalization group theory, developed by Kenneth G. Wilson and Michael E. Fisher, to calculate critical exponents. The method involves performing a perturbative expansion in terms of a small parameter, ϵ, which is the difference between the upper critical dimension, *d<sub>c</sub>*, and the spatial dimension of interest, *d*.\n\nϵ = *d<sub>c</sub>* - *d*\n\nFor a system described by a scalar order parameter with a φ<sup>4</sup> interaction (belonging to the Ising universality class), the upper critical dimension is *d<sub>c</sub>* = 4. Above this dimension, the critical exponents take on their classical, mean-field theory values. Below *d<sub>c</sub>*, fluctuations become significant and modify the exponents.\n\nFor the given system with a spatial dimension of *d* = 3, the expansion parameter is:\n\nϵ = 4 - 3 = 1\n\n**3. Calculation of α using the Epsilon Expansion**\n\nThe epsilon expansion provides expressions for critical exponents as a power series in ϵ. These series have been calculated to very high orders for the general *N*-vector model, which describes systems with an *N*-component order parameter. The specific heat exponent α to the second order in ϵ is given by:\n\nα = (4 - *N*)/(2(*N* + 8)) * ϵ - (*N* + 2)<sup>2</sup>(*N* + 28)/(2(*N* + 8)<sup>3</sup>) * ϵ<sup>2</sup> + O(ϵ<sup>3</sup>)\n\nFor the system in question, which falls into the Ising universality class, the order parameter is a scalar, meaning *N* = 1. Substituting *N* = 1 and ϵ = 1 into the formula, we get:\n\n*   **First-order approximation (O(ϵ)):**\n    α ≈ (4 - 1)/(2(1 + 8)) * 1 = 3/18 = **1/6 ≈ 0.167**\n\n*   **Second-order approximation (O(ϵ<sup>2</sup>)):**\n    The second-order term is: - (1 + 2)<sup>2</sup>(1 + 28) / (2(1 + 8)<sup>3</sup>) * 1<sup>2</sup> = - (9 * 29) / (2 * 729) = -261 / 1458 ≈ -0.179\n    α ≈ 0.167 - 0.179 = **-0.012**\n\nIt is important to note that the epsilon expansion is an asymptotic series. For ϵ=1, the convergence is not guaranteed, and higher-order terms become crucial for obtaining accurate results. More sophisticated resummation techniques are typically applied to the full series to get the most precise theoretical values for d=3, which place α at approximately 0.110. However, the direct epsilon expansion to second order as requested yields α ≈ -0.012.\n\n<<<\n-0.012\n>>>"
