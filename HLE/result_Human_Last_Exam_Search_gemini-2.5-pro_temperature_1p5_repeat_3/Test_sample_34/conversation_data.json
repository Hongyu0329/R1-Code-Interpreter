    "In a 100 big blind, rake-free cash game, a player on the button has a significant positional advantage, allowing for a very wide opening range. According to Game Theory Optimal (GTO) preflop charts for this specific scenario, the range of hands that can be profitably opened to 2.5x is extensive. In the absence of rake, even marginal hands become profitable opens due to the increased equity realization and fold equity.\n\nThe weakest suited hands are typically those with the lowest \"kicker\" card. For suited Jacks, the hand with the lowest possible kicker is J2s. A review of modern GTO preflop opening ranges for a 100bb stack from the button in a no-rake environment confirms that all suited Jacks are considered standard opens. Therefore, the worst suited Jack you should open from the button is the one with the lowest possible side card.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
