    "This problem requires us to find the number of possible integer values for side AC such that two different triangles can be formed. The term `SNYWR` is a placeholder for a numerical value, which is often the year in the context of math competitions where this problem format appears. Assuming SNYWR stands for the year 2014, we have BC = 2014.\n\nFor a triangle with given sides `a` (BC) and `b` (AC) and a given non-right angle `B` opposite side `b`, two distinct triangles can be formed if and only if the angle `B` is acute and the length of the side `b` is strictly between the altitude from vertex C and the length of side `a`.\n\nHere are the details:\n*   The triangle is denoted as ABC.\n*   The length of side BC, let's call it `a`, is `S = 2014`.\n*   The measure of angle B is `30°`, which is an acute angle.\n*   Let the length of side AC be `b` and the length of side AB be `c`.\n\nFor there to be two possible values for the side length AB, we must be in the ambiguous case (SSA) of the Law of Sines. The condition for two distinct triangles to exist when angle B is acute is:\n\n`h < b < a`\n\nWhere:\n*   `a` is the length of the side adjacent to the given angle (BC).\n*   `b` is the length of the side opposite the given angle (AC).\n*   `h` is the altitude from vertex C to the line containing side AB.\n\nFirst, we calculate the altitude `h`:\n`h = a * sin(B)`\n`h = BC * sin(30°)`\n`h = 2014 * 0.5`\n`h = 1007`\n\nNow, we apply the condition for the existence of two triangles:\n`h < AC < BC`\n`1007 < AC < 2014`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of integer values of AC that satisfy this condition. The integers for AC must be greater than 1007 and less than 2014.\n\nThe possible integer values for AC are 1008, 1009, 1010, ..., 2013.\n\nTo find the number of integers in this range, we can use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = `2013 - 1008 + 1`\nNumber of values = `1005 + 1`\nNumber of values = `1006`\n\nThus, there are 1006 integer values for AC for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<1006>>>"
