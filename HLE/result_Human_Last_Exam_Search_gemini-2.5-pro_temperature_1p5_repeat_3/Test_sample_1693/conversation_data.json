    "**The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the ocean liner SS Champlain.**\n\nWith a gross registered tonnage of 28,124, the SS Champlain was a significant vessel in the French Line's fleet. The ship's demise came in the final days of the Battle of France. On June 17, 1940, the liner struck a German air-laid mine while at anchor off La Pallice, France, and subsequently capsized. A few days later, the German submarine U-65 torpedoed the wreck. This event occurred just before the armistice was signed on June 22, 1940.\n\nInitially, reports erroneously claimed a high death toll of up to 300 people. However, it was later clarified that while there were numerous injuries, the number of fatalities was around 11 or 12. The SS Champlain is considered one of the largest ships to be sunk during the Second World War.\n\nOther French naval losses during this period were either smaller in displacement or were not caused by U-boat attacks. For instance, the battleship *Bretagne*, with a displacement of 23,936 tonnes, was sunk in July 1940 during the British attack on Mers-el-KÃ©bir, after the armistice. The French submarine *Doris*, sunk by the German U-boat U-9 in May 1940, had a surfaced displacement of only 615 tons.\n\n<<<SS Champlain>>>"
