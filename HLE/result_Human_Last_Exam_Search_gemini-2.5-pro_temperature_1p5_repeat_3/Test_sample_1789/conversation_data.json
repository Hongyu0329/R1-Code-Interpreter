    "To determine the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset of the number N = 823564528378596, we follow a multi-step process that involves number theory and combinatorics.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the given number N. An integer's divisor poset is a graded poset where the elements are the divisors of the integer, ordered by divisibility. The rank of a divisor is the number of its prime factors, counted with multiplicity. For such posets, it is known that the largest antichains are the sets of divisors with the same rank. The problem then becomes finding the sum of the sizes of the 20 largest ranks.\n\nThe prime factorization of N = 823564528378596 is:\nN = 2² × 3¹ × 7¹ × 11¹ × 13¹ × 17¹ × 19¹ × 23¹ × 29¹ × 31¹ × 37¹ × 41¹ × 43¹ × 47¹ × 53¹ × 59¹ × 61¹ × 67¹ × 71¹ × 73¹ × 79¹ × 83¹\n\nThe rank of a divisor of N is the sum of the exponents of its prime factors. The total number of prime factors of N, including multiplicities, is Ω(N) = 2 + 21 = 23. Therefore, the possible ranks for the divisors of N range from 0 (for the divisor 1) to 23 (for the divisor N itself), resulting in a total of 24 distinct ranks.\n\nThe number of divisors for each rank *k*, denoted as d(k), can be calculated using a generating function. This function is derived from the prime factorization of N. For a prime factor p with exponent *a*, the corresponding term in the generating function is (1 + x + x² + ... + xᵃ). For N, the generating function P(x) is:\nP(x) = (1 + x + x²) * (1 + x)²¹\n\nThe number of divisors of rank *k*, d(k), is the coefficient of xᵏ in the polynomial P(x). This coefficient can be calculated as the sum of three binomial coefficients:\nd(k) = C(21, k) + C(21, k-1) + C(21, k-2)\n\nThe total number of divisors of N is the sum of all d(k) for k from 0 to 23. This sum is equal to (2+1) * (1+1)²¹ = 3 * 2²¹ = 6,291,456.\n\nTo find the size of the largest union of 20 antichains, we need to sum the sizes of the 20 largest ranks. This is equivalent to calculating the total number of divisors and subtracting the sizes of the 4 smallest ranks. The distribution of rank sizes is unimodal, with the smallest ranks at the extremes (ranks 0, 1, 22, and 23).\n\nLet's calculate the sizes of these four smallest ranks:\n*   **d(0):** Divisors of rank 0. This is only the divisor 1. So, d(0) = 1.\n*   **d(1):** Divisors of rank 1. These are the 21 odd prime factors and the prime factor 2. So, d(1) = 22.\n*   **d(23):** Divisors of rank 23. This is only the number N itself. So, d(23) = 1.\n*   **d(22):** Divisors of rank 22. These are of the form N/p, where p is one of the 21 odd prime factors, or N/2. So, d(22) = 22.\n\nThe sum of the sizes of the four smallest ranks is 1 + 22 + 1 + 22 = 46.\n\nThe size of the largest union of 20 antichains is the total number of divisors minus the sum of the sizes of these four smallest ranks:\n6,291,456 - 46 = 6,291,410.\n\n<<<6291410>>>"
