    "The most widely recognized and efficient method for the production of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) involves the direct chemical reaction between xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas. This synthesis is typically conducted by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, usually in a 1:5 molar ratio, within a sealed nickel vessel. The nickel container is utilized because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface, which prevents corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nThe optimal temperature for this reaction to efficiently yield Xenon tetrafluoride is consistently reported as 400°C. While the reaction can occur over a range of temperatures, typically between 300°C and 500°C, 400°C is cited as the ideal condition for maximizing the yield and purity of XeF₄. Temperature control is critical, as lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of Xenon difluoride (XeF₂), whereas higher temperatures are more conducive to producing Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n\nAlthough some reaction products of xenon fluorides can be observed at temperatures as low as 120°C, and other synthesis methods like using an electric discharge at low temperatures exist, these are generally not considered efficient for producing pure Xenon tetrafluoride due to the formation of significant impurities. Therefore, the established and efficient synthesis relies on the higher thermal energy provided by heating to 400°C.\n\n<<<B>>>"
