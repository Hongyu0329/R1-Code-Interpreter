    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community. It is often denoted as S(q, ω) or S(α, β).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. The dynamic structure factor is its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time. This function is crucial as it contains information about the inter-particle correlations and how they evolve over time.\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality safety, the dynamic structure factor is used to calculate thermal neutron scattering cross-sections. These calculations are essential for accurately modeling neutron transport and moderation in nuclear systems, which is a fundamental aspect of ensuring criticality safety. For example, the thermal scattering law, S(α, β), which is directly related to the dynamic structure factor, is a key input for codes like MCNP used in criticality safety analyses. The relationship between the dynamic structure factor and the pair correlation function provides the theoretical basis for understanding how the microscopic structure and dynamics of materials affect neutron scattering in a reactor environment.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
