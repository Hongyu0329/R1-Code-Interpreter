    "In the provided chess position, the optimal move for White is to trade queens, simplifying the position into a winning pawn endgame.\n\nWhite's key advantage is the advanced passed pawn on d6. By exchanging queens, White eliminates Black's most active piece and the primary threat, allowing White's king to become a decisive factor in the resulting pawn endgame.\n\nAfter the queen exchange, White's plan involves activating the king to support its own passed pawn and attack Black's pawns. Although Black's king is also active, careful and precise play allows White to create a winning advantage.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
