    "To determine the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we will proceed in several steps.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the base field and the structure of the extension\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\alpha$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a well-known biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. This element is in $K$.\nThe field $L$ can be expressed as $L = K(\\alpha) = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\nThe degree of the extension $L/K$ is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $\\beta$ is a square in $K$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension\n\nTo check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can check its norm with respect to a sub-extension, for instance $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. An element $\\gamma \\in K$ is a square in $K$ only if its norm $N_{K/F}(\\gamma)$ is a square in the subfield $F$.\nThe automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\sigma: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\nThe norm of $\\beta$ is:\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\n$= 6(4 + 4\\sqrt{2} + 2) = 6(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow, we check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing the coefficients, we get the system of equations:\n1. $a^2 + 2b^2 = 36$\n2. $2ab = 24 \\implies ab = 12 \\implies b=12/a$\n\nSubstituting (2) into (1):\n$a^2 + 2(144/a^2) = 36 \\implies a^4 - 36a^2 + 288 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula for $a^2$:\n$a^2 = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{36^2 - 4 \\cdot 288}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{1296 - 1152}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{2} = \\frac{36 \\pm 12}{2}$.\nThis gives $a^2 = 24$ or $a^2=12$. Neither 24 nor 12 is a square of a rational number. Thus, $a$ is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis shows that $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\nTherefore, the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is $x^2 - \\beta$, and $[L:K] = 2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n### Step 3: Show that L/Q is a Galois extension\n\nTo show $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, we need to show it is the splitting field of a polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe conjugates of $\\beta$ under $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ are:\n*   $\\beta_1 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_2 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_3 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n*   $\\beta_4 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must include all conjugates. Let $P(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^4 (x^2-\\beta_i)$. This is a polynomial of degree 8 with rational coefficients. Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_i}$.\nWe need to show all these roots are in $L$.\n$\\alpha_1 = \\sqrt{\\beta_1} = \\alpha \\in L$.\n$\\sqrt{\\beta_2} = \\sqrt{\\beta_1 \\frac{\\beta_2}{\\beta_1}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2}} = \\alpha \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$. Since $\\alpha \\in L$ and $\\sqrt{2}-1 \\in K \\subset L$, $\\sqrt{\\beta_2} \\in L$.\n$\\sqrt{\\beta_3} = \\sqrt{\\beta_1 \\frac{\\beta_3}{\\beta_1}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}}} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6}} = \\alpha \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\alpha \\frac{\\sqrt{6}(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{2}$. Since $\\alpha \\in L$ and $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{2} \\in K \\subset L$, $\\sqrt{\\beta_3} \\in L$.\n$\\sqrt{\\beta_4}$ is also in $L$ by a similar argument.\nSince all roots $\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_i}$ are in $L$, $L$ is the splitting field of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and thus $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the structure of the Galois group G = Gal(L/Q)\n\n$|G|=8$. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$ (dihedral), and $Q_8$ (quaternion).\n\nA known theorem states that for an abelian extension $K/F$, the extension $L=K(\\sqrt{\\gamma})$ is abelian over $F$ if and only if $\\sigma(\\gamma)/\\gamma$ is a square in $K$ for all $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/F)$.\nHere, $F=\\mathbb{Q}$, $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ and $\\gamma=\\beta$. $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is abelian. Let's check the condition for its generators.\nLet $\\bar{\\sigma_1} \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be defined by $\\bar{\\sigma_1}(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\bar{\\sigma_1}(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma_1}(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = (\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$.\nSince $\\sqrt{2}-1 \\in K$, this is a square in $K$.\n\nLet $\\bar{\\sigma_2} \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be defined by $\\bar{\\sigma_2}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\bar{\\sigma_2}(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\frac{\\bar{\\sigma_2}(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6} = (\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}})^2 = (\\frac{\\sqrt{18}-\\sqrt{6}}{6})^2 = (\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}}{6})^2$.\nSince $\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}}{6} \\in K$, this is also a square in $K$.\n\nSince the condition holds for the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is abelian. This eliminates the non-abelian groups $D_4$ and $Q_8$.\nThe remaining possibilities are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, and $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet's examine the orders of elements in $G$.\nLet $\\sigma_1$ be a lift of $\\bar{\\sigma_1}$ to $G$. Then $\\sigma_1^2$ acts as the identity on $K$. Its action on $\\alpha=\\sqrt{\\beta}$ is:\n$\\sigma_1^2(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\sigma_1(\\alpha))$. We can choose the lift such that $\\sigma_1(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{\\bar{\\sigma_1}(\\beta)} = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\nThen $\\sigma_1^2(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)) = \\sigma_1(\\alpha)\\sigma_1(\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)(-\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\alpha(-(2-1)) = -\\alpha$.\nSo, $\\sigma_1^2$ is the automorphism that sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$ and is the identity on $K$. This automorphism, let's call it $\\tau$, is of order 2.\nThus, $\\sigma_1$ is an element of order 4.\nSince $G$ contains an element of order 4, it cannot be $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe choice is now between $C_8$ and $C_4 \\times C_2$. A group isomorphic to $C_8$ has only one element of order 2. A group isomorphic to $C_4 \\times C_2$ has three elements of order 2.\nWe already have one element of order 2, $\\tau=\\sigma_1^2$. Let's find another one.\nLet $\\sigma_2$ be a lift of $\\bar{\\sigma_2}$. As shown before, $\\sigma_2^2=\\tau$. So $\\sigma_2$ also has order 4.\nConsider the element $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$. Since the group is abelian, its order is easy to compute:\n$(\\sigma_1\\sigma_2)^2 = \\sigma_1^2\\sigma_2^2 = \\tau \\cdot \\tau = \\tau^2 = \\text{id}$.\nSo $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$ has order 2. We just need to check that it is not the identity or $\\tau$.\nThe action of $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$ on $K$ corresponds to $\\bar{\\sigma_1}\\bar{\\sigma_2}$, which sends $\\sqrt{2}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}\\mapsto-\\sqrt{3}$. This is not the identity on $K$, so $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 \\neq \\text{id}$ and $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 \\neq \\tau$.\nThus, $G$ has at least two distinct elements of order 2 ($\\tau$ and $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$).\nThis eliminates $C_8$. The only remaining possibility is $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is an abelian group of order 8 with at least one element of order 4 and more than one element of order 2. Therefore, the Galois group is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\n<<<The Galois Group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $C_4 \\times C_2$.>>>"
