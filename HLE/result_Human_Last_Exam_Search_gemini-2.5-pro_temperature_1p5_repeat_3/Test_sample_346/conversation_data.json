    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to identify the Church numeral `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression.\n\n**1. Simplifying the Combinators**\n\nThe given expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n\nLet's break down the core components:\n*   The combinator `B = S(K S) K` represents function composition: `B f g x = f(g x)`.\n*   The combinator `S B = S(S(K S) K)` represents the successor function (`succ`) for Church numerals. It takes a numeral `n` and returns `n+1`. `succ n f x = f(n f x)`.\n*   The expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` in the problem is `S B`, so it is the successor function, `succ`.\n*   The combinator `I` is equivalent to the Church numeral for 1 (`1_c`), as `I f x = f x`, which is `f` applied once to `x`.\n*   The combinator `U = S(I)(I)` represents self-application: `U x = x x`.\n\n**2. Reducing the Expression**\n\nThe expression can now be written as:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(succ I))))(succ U))`\n\nLet's reduce this expression by applying it to a function `f` and an argument `x`, which is how Church numerals are defined.\nThe combinator `S(I)` has the reduction rule: `S(I) A f = f(A f)`.\n\nApplying this rule iteratively:\n1.  Let the entire expression be `E`. `E` is a function that takes `f` and `x`.\n2.  `E f x = S(I) (S(I)(S(I)(K(succ I))(succ U))) f x`\n3.  This reduces to `f ( (S(I)(S(I)(K(succ I))(succ U))) f ) x`\n4.  Applying the rule again: `f ( f ( (S(I)(K(succ I))(succ U)) f ) ) x`\n5.  And a third time: `f ( f ( f ( (K(succ I))(succ U) f ) ) ) x`\n\nNow, let's evaluate the innermost part `(K(succ I))(succ U) f`:\n*   `succ I` is the successor of the Church numeral 1, which is the Church numeral 2 (`2_c`).\n*   So, `K(succ I)` is `K(2_c)`.\n*   The `K` combinator's rule is `K x y = x`. Therefore, `K(2_c) (succ U) = 2_c`.\n*   The application to `f`, `(K(2_c) (succ U)) f`, becomes `2_c f`.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to `位f.位x. f(f(f(2_c f))) x`.\n\nThis is not in the standard form of a Church numeral `n`, which is `位f.位x. f^n x`. To determine the value of `n`, we can test the behavior of the expression `E` by substituting a known Church numeral for the function `f`.\n\n**3. Determining the Integer n**\n\nLet's test the expression `E` with `f = 2_c`. In the context of Church numerals, applying one numeral `m` to another `n`, written as `m(n)`, corresponds to exponentiation, `n^m`.\n\nThe expression becomes `E(2_c) = 2_c(2_c(2_c(2_c)))`. Let's evaluate this from the inside out:\n*   `2_c(2_c)` corresponds to `2^2 = 4`. The result is the Church numeral `4_c`.\n*   `2_c(4_c)` corresponds to `4^2 = 16`. The result is the Church numeral `16_c`.\n*   `2_c(16_c)` corresponds to `16^2 = 256`. The result is the Church numeral `256_c`.\n\nSo, `E(2_c) = 256_c`.\n\nNow we compare this to the behavior of a standard Church numeral `n_c` when applied to `2_c`.\n`n_c(2_c)` corresponds to exponentiation `2^n`.\n\nBy equating the two, we get:\n`2^n = 256`\n`2^n = 2^8`\nTherefore, `n = 8`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(8) = 3`.\n\n<<<3>>>"
