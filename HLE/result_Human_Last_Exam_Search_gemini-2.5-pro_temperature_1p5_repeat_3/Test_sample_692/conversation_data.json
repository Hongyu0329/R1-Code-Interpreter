    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is a subject of scholarly discussion, with several artifacts being candidates depending on the interpretation of the inscriptions and the dating methods. The principal contenders are the San Andrés cylinder seal, Monument 3 from San José Mogote, and Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.\n\nOne of the most ancient potential recorded dates is found on a cylinder seal from San Andrés, near the Olmec center of La Venta in Tabasco, Mexico. Dated to approximately 650 BCE, the seal bears glyphs that have been interpreted as the day \"3 Ajaw\" in the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. This interpretation, however, is not universally accepted, with some scholars suggesting the symbols may be iconographic rather than calendrical.\n\nAnother very early example of a recorded date comes from the Zapotec civilization at San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. Monument 3, a carved stone slab, is dated to before 500 BCE and features a relief of a captive. Between the figure's legs are glyphs that are interpreted as the calendrical name \"1 Earthquake,\" representing a day in the 260-day calendar.\n\nWhile these artifacts represent early calendrical notations within a 260-day cycle, the earliest known date recorded in the more complex Long Count calendar is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico. This monument has a partially effaced Long Count inscription that has been reconstructed to correspond to December 8, 36 BCE. This makes it the most widely accepted earliest contemporaneously carved long-form date in the Americas.\n\nAnother significant artifact is Stela 2 from Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, which also bears a Long Count date. Its dating is more debated, with a potential range between 236 BCE and 19 BCE; however, more recent studies have suggested a later date, possibly in the 1st century CE.\n\nIt is also important to mention the Cascajal Block, discovered near the Olmec site of San Lorenzo. Dated to around 900 BCE, it is considered by many to be the earliest evidence of writing in the New World. However, the block's text of 62 glyphs does not appear to contain any calendrical dates.\n\nIn summary, while the earliest definitive Long Count date is from 36 BCE, the earliest known recorded dates in a pre-Columbian writing system are likely the 260-day calendar notations from the Olmec and Zapotec civilizations, dating back to at least 650-500 BCE.\n\n<<<The earliest potential recorded date is \"3 Ajaw\" on the Olmec San Andrés cylinder seal from approximately 650 BCE, with another early example being the Zapotec \"1 Earthquake\" glyph from around 600-500 BCE. The earliest securely dated Long Count inscription is 36 BCE on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.>>>"
