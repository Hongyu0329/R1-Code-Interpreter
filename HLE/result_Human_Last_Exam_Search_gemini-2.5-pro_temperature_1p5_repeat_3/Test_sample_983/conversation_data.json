    "The next number in the sequence is 2400.\n\nThe sequence consists of numbers that are multiples of 6 and are composed only of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The sequence is ordered numerically.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the pattern:\n*   **Divisibility by 6:** For a number to be a multiple of 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. This means the number must be even and the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3.\n*   **Allowed Digits:** The numbers in the sequence must only contain the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet's verify this pattern with the last given number, 2352:\n*   It is a multiple of 6 (2352 / 6 = 392).\n*   It only contains the digits 2, 3, and 5.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we need to find the smallest integer greater than 2352 that satisfies both conditions. The numbers immediately following 2352 that are composed only of the allowed digits would be 2353, 2354, and 2355. However, none of these are divisible by 6.\n\nThe next number after 2355 that is formed using only the allowed digits is 2400.\n*   **Check divisibility by 6:** The sum of the digits of 2400 is 2 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 6, which is divisible by 3. Since the number ends in 0, it is even. Therefore, 2400 is divisible by 6.\n*   **Check allowed digits:** The number 2400 is composed only of the digits 0, 2, and 4.\n\nSince 2400 is the first number after 2352 to meet these criteria, it is the next number in the sequence.\n\n<<<2400>>>"
