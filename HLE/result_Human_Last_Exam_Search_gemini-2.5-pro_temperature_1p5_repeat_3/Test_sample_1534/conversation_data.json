    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**. The entire posterior aspect of the brain, including these lobes, is encased in a protective layer of **cranial cartilage**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a component of the posterior subesophageal mass, a major division of the cuttlefish brain. This region of the brain is responsible for controlling various motor actions, particularly those in the more posterior part of the animal's body. For instance, the palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in escape responses and the release of ink, which are mediated by the funnel.\n\nThree-dimensional brain atlases of the dwarf cuttlefish, created using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), clearly depict the spatial arrangement of these lobes. In a posterior view of the brain, the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes are situated near the palliovisceral lobe. The posterior chromatophore lobes are integral to controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) on the mantle, enabling the cuttlefish's remarkable ability to camouflage itself. The fin lobes, as their name suggests, control the movement of the fins.\n\nThese neural structures, forming part of the posterior subesophageal mass, project through an opening in the cranial cartilage that otherwise encloses the posterior portion of the brain.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.
