You are correct in your physical intuition. The normalized magnetic helicity of Alfven ion cyclotron waves is calculated using magnetic field components perpendicular to the local magnetic field, not the radial direction. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial, but follows the Parker spiral. The analysis of spacecraft data involves rotating the magnetic field measurements into a field-aligned coordinate system to perform the calculation correctly.
