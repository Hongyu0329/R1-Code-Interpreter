    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix A:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nwe can use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * (3) - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nThe provided matrix is the Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra $\\tilde{A}_2$. A property of affine Cartan matrices is that their determinant is always zero. The reference to the Markov quiver is relevant as this matrix is associated with the Markov equation, particularly in the context of cluster algebras. The Markov numbers are integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$, and 13 is a Markov number. However, for the specific calculation requested, only the matrix itself is needed.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n<<<0>>>"
