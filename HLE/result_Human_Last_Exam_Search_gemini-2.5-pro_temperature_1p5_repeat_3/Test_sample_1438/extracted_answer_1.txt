The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is defined by the Berezin integration rules: ∫dθ = 0 and ∫θ dθ = 1. The Pauli principle itself is enforced by the anti-commuting nature of the Grassmann variables, specifically that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero (θ²=0).
