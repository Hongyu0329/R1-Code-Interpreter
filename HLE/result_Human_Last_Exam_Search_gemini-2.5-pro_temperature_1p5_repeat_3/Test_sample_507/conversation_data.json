    "An interesting example of two languages from distinct Asian cultures with minimal direct contact that share remarkably similar words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" can be found in **Korean** and **Tamil**.\n\nHere is a comparison of the words for \"mom,\" \"dad,\" and \"broom\" in these two languages:\n\n| Word | Korean | Tamil |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Mom** | **엄마 (Eomma)** | **அம்மா (Amma)** |\n| **Dad** | **아빠 (Appa)** | **அப்பா (Appa)** |\n| **Broom**| 빗자루 (Bitjaru) | துடைப்பம் (Thudaippam) |\n\nThe terms for \"mom\" and \"dad\" in Korean and Tamil are nearly identical in pronunciation. For \"mom,\" both languages use a word with a similar \"mma\" sound (Eomma/Amma). For \"dad,\" the word \"Appa\" is used in both languages.\n\nThese striking similarities have led some linguists to propose a \"Dravido-Korean\" language family, suggesting a common origin. However, this theory is not widely accepted by the mainstream linguistic community, and the resemblances are often considered coincidental, possibly arising from the simple sounds babies make, or from a yet-unproven ancient language contact.\n\nThe cultures are geographically located far from each other, with Korea in East Asia and the Tamil-speaking region in Southern India and Sri Lanka. While there are theories about ancient maritime trade links and the migration of a princess from a Tamil-speaking region to Korea, sustained, direct contact that would lead to such fundamental words being borrowed is not historically established, fitting the user's criterion of \"no direct contact\".\n\nIn contrast to the words for parents, the words for \"broom\" in Korean, *bitjaru* (빗자루), and in Tamil, *thudaippam* (துடைப்பம்), are not similar.\n\n<<<Korean and Tamil>>>"
