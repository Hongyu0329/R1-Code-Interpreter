    "A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (K5), connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the bottleneck edge.\n\nIn a complete graph with *m* nodes, each node has a degree of *m-1*. For our K5 cliques, each of the 5 nodes has 4 connections within its own clique.\n\nLet's analyze the degrees of the nodes in the 10-node barbell graph:\n*   There are two cliques of 5 nodes.\n*   The bottleneck edge connects one node from each clique. Let's call these the \"bridgehead\" nodes.\n*   The 8 non-bridgehead nodes (4 in each clique) are only connected to the other 4 nodes in their respective cliques. Therefore, their degree is 4.\n*   The 2 bridgehead nodes are connected to the 4 other nodes in their own clique and also to the other bridgehead node via the bottleneck edge. Thus, their degree is 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a process where nodes communicate with their neighbors. In a common model, a node is selected uniformly at random from the entire graph, and then it selects one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with. This two-step process defines the probability of sampling any directed edge in the graph.\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events:\n1.  The bridgehead node from the first clique is chosen and it communicates with the bridgehead node in the second clique.\n2.  The bridgehead node from the second clique is chosen and it communicates with the bridgehead node in the first clique.\n\nLet the two bridgehead nodes be `u` and `v`.\n*   The total number of nodes in the graph is 10.\n*   The probability of selecting node `u` is 1/10.\n*   The degree of node `u` is 5.\n*   The probability of node `u` choosing the bottleneck edge to communicate with `v` is 1/degree(u) = 1/5.\n*   The probability of the first event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nSimilarly, for the second event:\n*   The probability of selecting node `v` is 1/10.\n*   The degree of node `v` is 5.\n*   The probability of node `v` choosing the bottleneck edge to communicate with `u` is 1/degree(v) = 1/5.\n*   The probability of the second event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of these two probabilities:\nTotal Probability = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nTherefore, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25, or 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
