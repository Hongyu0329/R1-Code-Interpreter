The 'critical amount of correlation' between the input populations, defined as `C = <v_k s_k>`, which balances potentiation and depression is given by the expression: `C = μ(2Nθ - 2(N-1)μ - 1)`, where `μ` is the average rate of activation, `N` is the number of neurons in each input layer, and `θ` is the heterosynaptic offset constant.
