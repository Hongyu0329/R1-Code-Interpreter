The homotopy-theoretic obstructions for the two paths of bundle automorphisms, $\phi_t$ and $\psi_t$, to be homotopic relative to their endpoints are determined by an element in the first homotopy group of the space of automorphisms of the bundle $E$, denoted $\pi_1(\text{Aut}(E))$. This group fits into a short exact sequence derived from the evaluation fibration, which relates the full group of automorphisms to those that are the identity over a basepoint.

The obstructions can be understood as elements of the following groups:
*   **$\pi_1(SO(2k))$**: This group captures the obstruction within each fiber. The two paths, when restricted to a single fiber of the bundle, trace out two paths in the special orthogonal group $SO(2k)$ from the identity to the negative identity. The difference between these paths forms a loop, and its homotopy class is an element of $\pi_1(SO(2k))$. For $2k=2$, this group is the integers $\mathbb{Z}$, and for $2k \ge 3$, it is $\mathbb{Z}_2$. If this obstruction is non-zero, the paths are not homotopic.

*   **$H^{n-1}(X; \pi_{n+1}(SO(2k)))$**: If the first obstruction vanishes (meaning the paths are fiber-wise homotopic), there is a further obstruction to deforming the entire bundle automorphism paths into one another. This secondary obstruction lies in the group of based gauge transformations, $\pi_1(\text{Aut}_*(E))$. Through an analysis using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, this group is identified with the cohomology group $H^n(\Sigma X; \pi_{n+1}(SO(2k)))$. By the suspension isomorphism for cohomology, this is isomorphic to $\tilde{H}^{n-1}(X; \pi_{n+1}(SO(2k)))$. Since $X$ is a homology $(n-1)$-sphere, this group is isomorphic to the homotopy group $\pi_{n+1}(SO(2k))$.

In summary, the obstructions are characterized by elements in the following list of groups:
1.  $\pi_1(SO(2k))$
2.  $H^{n-1}(X; \pi_{n+1}(SO(2k)))$
