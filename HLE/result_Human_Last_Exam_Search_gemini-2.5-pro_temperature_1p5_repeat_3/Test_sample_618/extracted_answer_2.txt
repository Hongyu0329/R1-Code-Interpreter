The general representation for the transformation on x, denoted by $x \to x^*$, is given by two forms depending on the group parameters:
1.  If $c_1 = 0$: $x^* = x + (c_2 + c_3 e^{k_1 t})\epsilon$
2.  If $c_1 \neq 0$: $x^* = x + c_2 \epsilon + \frac{c_3 e^{k_1 t}}{k_1 c_1}(e^{k_1 c_1 \epsilon} - 1)$
where $c_1, c_2, c_3$ are arbitrary constants defining a specific transformation within the group, and $\epsilon$ is the group parameter.
