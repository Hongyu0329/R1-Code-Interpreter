    "Recent work in algebraic K-theory has established a vanishing result for the even K-groups of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$. According to research by Benjamin Antieau, Achim Krause, and Thomas Nikolaus, while it was previously thought by some that these groups were always non-trivial, they are in fact zero for high degrees.\n\nIn a talk explaining the results of their 2022 and 2024 preprints, Antieau provides the explicit bound beyond which these groups vanish. The p-primary component of the even K-group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is zero for all $n$ such that $n+1 > \\frac{p^2}{(p-1)^2} \\lceil \\frac{k}{e} \\rceil - 1$. For the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$, the ramification index $e$ of the underlying p-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ is 1.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$ is nonzero. This corresponds to the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k\\mathbb{Z}$ with $p=3$ and $k=3$.\n\nWe apply the formula to find the bound for $n$:\n1.  The condition for vanishing is $n+1 > \\frac{3^2}{(3-1)^2} \\lceil \\frac{3}{1} \\rceil - 1$.\n2.  This simplifies to $n+1 > \\frac{9}{4} \\times 3 - 1$.\n3.  Calculating the expression gives $n+1 > \\frac{27}{4} - 1$, which is $n+1 > 6.75 - 1 = 5.75$.\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, the condition $n+1 > 5.75$ means that the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero for all $n+1 \\ge 6$, which implies it is zero for all $n \\ge 5$.\n\nTherefore, the K-group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero for $n=5, 6, 7, \\dots$. The largest natural number $n$ for which the group can be nonzero is the one immediately preceding the start of this vanishing range.\n\nThe largest value of $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
