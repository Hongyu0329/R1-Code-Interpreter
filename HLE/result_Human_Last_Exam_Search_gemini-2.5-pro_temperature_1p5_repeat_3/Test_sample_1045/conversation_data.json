    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we first need to find the number of functions for each atom (Carbon and Hydrogen) and then multiply by the number of atoms of each type in the molecule.\n\n### Analysis of the 6-31G Basis Set\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes a split-valence basis set. Here's how it breaks down for each atom type:\n\n*   **For Carbon (a second-row atom):**\n    *   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The '6' indicates that the core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The '31' indicates that the valence shell is split into two sets of basis functions.\n        *   The inner part of the valence shell (2s and 2p) is described by one set of contracted functions, each made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The outer part of the valence shell is described by a second set of functions, each made from a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   This means for each carbon atom, we have:\n        *   1s: 1 contracted function.\n        *   2s: 2 contracted functions (one from the '3' part, one from the '1' part).\n        *   2p: There are three p-orbitals (px, py, pz), and each is split like the 2s orbital. This gives 3 orbitals \\* 2 functions/orbital = 6 contracted functions.\n    *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (1s) + 2 (2s) + 6 (2p) = 9 contracted functions.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen (a first-row atom):**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core orbitals, only a 1s valence orbital.\n    *   The '31' split applies directly to the 1s orbital.\n        *   The inner part is represented by one contracted function made of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The outer part is represented by a second function made of 1 primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 2 contracted functions for the 1s orbital.\n\n### Calculation for Toluene (C7H8)\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it contains:\n*   7 Carbon atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of contracted basis functions:\n\n*   **From Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **From Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\nA 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene uses 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
