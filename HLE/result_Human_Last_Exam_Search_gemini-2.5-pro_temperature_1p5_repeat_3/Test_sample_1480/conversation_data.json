    "The rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, given a specific firing strength and a consequent membership grade, is calculated by applying a t-norm operation to these two values. A t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic. The most commonly used t-norms are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\nThe general formula for the rule activation level is:\nActivation Level = T(Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))\n\nWhere:\n*   Φ_k(x′) is the firing strength of the rule, given as 0.7.\n*   μG_k_j(y_j) is the membership grade of the consequent part of the rule, given as 0.9.\n*   T represents the t-norm operation.\n\nIn fuzzy systems, the composition of the firing strength and the consequent membership function is typically performed using a t-norm. If the specific t-norm is not mentioned, the minimum operator is the most common choice.\n\nUsing the minimum t-norm (also known as the Gödel t-norm), the calculation is as follows:\nActivation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\nUsing the product t-norm, the calculation would be:\nActivation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nSince the minimum t-norm is the most standard and widely applied, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
