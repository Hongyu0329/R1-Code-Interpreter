    "The provided answer choices represent various fates and processes related to gene duplication. To determine which is most likely responsible for both the retention *and* divergence of duplicate genes, it's essential to understand each mechanism.\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange that leads to the homogenization of sequences between duplicated genes. As it makes the gene copies more alike, it actively works against their divergence. Therefore, it is not the correct answer.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process by which a duplicated gene accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional. While this involves divergence from the functional copy, it represents a failure to *retain* a functional gene. It is a very common fate for duplicated genes but does not fulfill the \"retention\" criterion of the question.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the other copy acquires a completely new, beneficial function through mutation. This process explains both the retention of both gene copies (one for the old function, one for the new) and their divergence.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Here, an ancestral gene with multiple functions is duplicated, and each copy subsequently loses a different subset of the original functions. As a result, both copies are required to perform the complete set of ancestral functions, leading to their retention. This \"division of labor\" also necessitates that the genes diverge in their sequence and regulation.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern where a single ancestral species diversifies rapidly into a multitude of new forms to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material for such an event, adaptive radiation itself is a species-level or population-level process, not a molecular mechanism for the retention of individual genes.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, there is a key distinction in their proposed likelihood. Neofunctionalization depends on the rare occurrence of a beneficial mutation that confers a new function before one of the copies is silenced by degenerative mutations. In contrast, subfunctionalization can occur through neutral or near-neutral mutations that partially silence different aspects of the gene's function in each copy. Because these degenerative mutations are far more common than gain-of-function mutations, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely and more common initial step for preserving duplicate genes from being lost. Some models even suggest that subfunctionalization acts as a transitional state that saves a duplicate gene, which may then later undergo neofunctionalization. Therefore, both are critical, but subfunctionalization represents a more probable general mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence.\n\nGiven that both C and D are strong candidates, and the question asks for the *most likely* mechanism, subfunctionalization is often presented as a more pervasive and immediate pathway for duplicate gene preservation following duplication. It provides a neutral pathway for retention, making it a highly probable outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>"
