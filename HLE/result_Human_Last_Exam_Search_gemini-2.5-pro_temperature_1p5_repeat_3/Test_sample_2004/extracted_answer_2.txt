Based on an analysis of the provided data, the maximally parsimonious model for optimally predicting y is a square root model. This model provides an excellent fit to the data while using the minimum number of parameters.

The form of the model is:
y = a + b * √x

The estimated values for the parameters, reported to three significant digits, are:
*   **a = -0.969**
*   **b = 1.05**

Therefore, the final predictive equation is:
**y = -0.969 + 1.05 * √x**

This model was selected by comparing it against other simple parametric models (linear, logarithmic, and quadratic). The square root model yielded the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which balances model fit with complexity, making it the most parsimonious choice.
