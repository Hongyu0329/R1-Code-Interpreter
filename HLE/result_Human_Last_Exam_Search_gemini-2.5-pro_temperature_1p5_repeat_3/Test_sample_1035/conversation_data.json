    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35. This value is a known quantity in graph theory.\n\nLet \\( G \\) be a graph. A set of bipartite subgraphs \\( H_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_k \\) is said to cover \\( G \\) if every edge of \\( G \\) is an edge of at least one of the subgraphs \\( H_i \\). The problem is to find the minimum value of the sum of the number of vertices of these bipartite graphs, \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(H_i)| \\), for the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\).\n\nA result by G. Hansel and, independently, by G. O. H. Katona and E. Szemer√©di, provides the answer to this question. For the complete graph \\( K_n \\), the minimum sum of the orders of bipartite subgraphs that cover all its edges is given by the formula \\( n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\nTo solve the problem for n = 35, we need to compute this value:\n1.  Calculate \\( \\log_2 35 \\).\n2.  Find the ceiling of this value, \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\n3.  Multiply the result by 35.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\\( \\log_2 35 \\approx 5.129 \\)\nThe ceiling of this value is \\( \\lceil 5.129 \\rceil = 6 \\).\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices is \\( 35 \\times 6 = 210 \\).\n\nThis result can be achieved with a specific construction. Assign a unique binary vector of length \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) to each of the n vertices. For each of the k positions in the binary vectors, a complete bipartite graph is formed. The two sets of vertices in the bipartition are those vertices whose binary label has a '0' in that position and those with a '1' in that position, respectively. Any two vertices must differ in at least one bit of their binary labels, ensuring that the edge connecting them is included in the corresponding bipartite graph. This construction uses \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) bipartite graphs, each containing all n vertices, for a total sum of \\( n \\times k \\) vertices.\n\n<<<210>>>"
