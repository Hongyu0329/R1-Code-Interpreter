1. **Hotspot residues on the beta-1 subunit for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**
    * The interaction is primarily mediated by the **Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP)** located within the **guanylate kinase (GK) domain** of the beta-1 subunit. This forms a hydrophobic groove that binds to the Alpha-Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.
    * Key contributors to this hydrophobic pocket are **Leucine (L) residues** within the GK domain. The extensive hydrophobic interface ensures a high-affinity interaction.

2. **Hotspot residues on the beta-1 subunit for fine-tuning gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit:**
    * **HOOK Domain:** This flexible region connecting the SH3 and GK domains is a critical modulator of inactivation kinetics and sensitivity to signaling molecules like PIP2.
        *   **Charged Amino Acids:** The net charge and specific sequence of the HOOK domain, particularly the presence of polybasic stretches, influence the speed of inactivation.
        *   **Phenylalanine (F) Residues:** Specific phenylalanine residues within the HOOK domain are important for membrane interactions that modulate channel gating.
    * **Guanylate Kinase (GK) Domain:** This domain is not only for binding but also for allosterically modulating the channel's gating machinery. The interaction of the AID with the GK domain is thought to trigger conformational changes that affect channel opening and closing. The integrity of this domain is crucial for proper gating modulation.
