    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over a field with valuation $v$ normalized to $v(2)=1$, we analyze the structure of the curve's reduction modulo 2.\n\nLet the curve be $C$. Its equation is $z^2 = P(x)$ where $P(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$. The valuation $v$ is 2-adic, with $v(2)=1$.\n\nFirst, we consider a simpler, birationally equivalent model of the curve. Let $z = 2t+1$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$(2t+1)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$4t^2 + 4t + 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$4t(t+1) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n$2t(t+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nThis equation defines a model of the curve over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's examine its special fiber by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n$0 = x^3(x^2+1) \\pmod{2}$\nIn the field of 2 elements, $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this becomes $x^3(x+1)^2 = 0$.\nThe special fiber of this model consists of two components: the line $x=0$ with multiplicity 3, and the line $x=1$ with multiplicity 2. Since the special fiber is non-reduced, this is not a stable model. The stable reduction is obtained by a sequence of blow-ups to resolve the singularities and non-reduced components.\n\nA key invariant of a hyperelliptic curve is the discriminant of the polynomial $P(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $P(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$ is $\\Delta(P) = 1062912$.\nWe find the 2-adic valuation of this discriminant:\n$1062912 = 2^{11} \\cdot 519$.\nSo, $v(\\Delta(P)) = 11$.\n\nFor a hyperelliptic curve $z^2 = a_n x^n + \\dots$, the relevant invariant for the stable reduction is often the discriminant of the associated monic polynomial. Let $P_m(x) = P(x)/a_5 = x^5 + x^3 + 1/2$. The discriminant of the monic polynomial is related to the discriminant of the original polynomial by $\\Delta(P) = a_n^{2n-2} \\Delta(P_m)$.\nHere, $n=5$ and $a_5=2$. So $\\Delta(P) = 2^{2(5)-2} \\Delta(P_m) = 2^8 \\Delta(P_m)$.\nWe can calculate the valuation of the discriminant of the monic polynomial:\n$v(\\Delta(P_m)) = v(\\Delta(P)) - v(2^8) = 11 - 8v(2) = 11 - 8 = 3$.\n\nThe theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves, particularly the work of Saito and Liu, relates the valuation of the discriminant to the geometry of the stable reduction. The stable reduction consists of a graph of projective lines. The singularities of the special fiber of the stable model are ordinary double points (nodes). A node is locally described by an equation of the form $uv = \\pi^m$ in the completed local ring, where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer of the valuation ring (here, we can take $\\pi=2$). The integer $m$ is called the thickness of the double point.\n\nFor a curve of genus 2 whose stable reduction consists of two components intersecting at a single node, the thickness of this node is precisely the valuation of the discriminant of the associated monic polynomial. While a full analysis of the stable reduction's component graph is complex, the valuation $v(\\Delta(P_m)) = 3$ is the fundamental measure of the badness of the reduction at the prime 2. This value corresponds to the thickness of the double point in the stable fiber.\n\n"
