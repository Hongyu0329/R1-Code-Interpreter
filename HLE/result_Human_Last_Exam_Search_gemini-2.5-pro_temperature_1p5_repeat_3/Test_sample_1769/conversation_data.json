    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would have evolved from the native Old English word, which was ***sweostor***.\n\nThe current word, \"sister,\" is the result of linguistic blending. The native Old English *sweostor* (with dialectal variations like *swuster* and *swester*) was influenced by the Old Norse cognate, ***systir***. This Norse influence is specifically credited with introducing the hard /sk/ sound (later softening to /s/) and the 'i' vowel sound that we use today.\n\nWithout this Norse interaction, *sweostor* would have followed a different evolutionary path.\n\n1.  **Old English:** The word was *sweostor*. It was a common term of kinship derived from the same Proto-Germanic root, *\\*swestēr*, as its Norse and other Germanic counterparts.\n2.  **Middle English:** As Old English transitioned into Middle English, *sweostor* naturally evolved into ***suster***. This form shows a simplification of the initial \"sw\" sound and a change in the vowel.\n3.  **Hypothetical Modern English:** From the Middle English form *suster*, the word would likely have undergone the Great Vowel Shift. The 'u' sound /ʊ/ in *suster* would typically evolve into the modern /ʌ/ sound, which is the vowel sound in words like \"cup\" or \"duster.\"\n\nTherefore, the Modern English word would most plausibly be spelled **Suster** and rhyme with \"duster\".\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
