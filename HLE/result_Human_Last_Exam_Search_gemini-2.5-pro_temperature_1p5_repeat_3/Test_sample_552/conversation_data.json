    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures.\n\nScholarly analysis of Einstein's papers from his \"miraculous year\" frequently notes that they contained few, if any, citations to contemporary literature. His paper on Brownian motion, in particular, included no formal list of references or footnotes citing the work or lectures of other scientists.\n\nWhile Einstein's work was built upon the broader foundation of the kinetic theory of heat, advanced by physicists such as Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs, direct citations to their lectures or publications are absent in his paper. Some historians of science suggest that Einstein may have been unaware of some of the contemporary work related to the topics he was writing about.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
