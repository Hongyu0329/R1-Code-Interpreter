    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the Iliad**\nFirst, we need to compile a list of all the real, physical mountains that are named in Homer's Iliad. The most prominent ones are:\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned throughout the epic.\n*   **Mount Ida:** A mountain near Troy from which Zeus often observes the battle.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** The island mountain from which Poseidon watches the battle.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** A mountain in Thessaly, mentioned as the source of the ash wood for Achilles' spear.\n*   **Mount Athos:** A mountain on a peninsula in the Aegean Sea, mentioned as a landmark during Hera's journey.\n\n**Step 2: Exclude Mount Olympus as per the Question**\nThe question explicitly asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus. Therefore, we will determine the elevation of Mount Olympus to use as a reference but exclude it from the final comparison.\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The highest peak, Mytikas, is **2,918 meters (9,573 feet)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Modern Elevations of the Remaining Historical Mountains**\nNow we must find the current, accepted elevations for the other mountains on our list to compare them.\n*   **Mount Ida:** The historical Mount Ida near Troy is today known as Kaz Dağı in Turkey. Its highest peak is **1,774 meters (5,820 feet)**.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** The highest peak of the island of Samothrace is Mount Fengari (or Saos). Its elevation is **1,611 meters (5,285 feet)**.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** A mountain in Thessaly, Greece. Its highest peak is Pourianos Stavros, at **1,624 meters (5,328 feet)**.\n*   **Mount Athos:** A mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece. Its peak reaches **2,033 meters (6,670 feet)**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Elevations to Find the Tallest**\nLet's compare the elevations of the candidate mountains:\n1.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters\n2.  **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters\n3.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters\n4.  **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 meters\n\nFrom this comparison, Mount Athos is clearly the tallest among the options.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Historical vs. Mythical:** All the mountains listed are real, historical locations that can be found on a modern map.\n*   **Specific Mentions:** Each of these mountains has a specific reference in the Iliad. Mount Athos is mentioned in Book 14 when the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Lemnos. The text describes her passing over \"snowy Athos.\"\n*   **The Two Mount Idas:** It's important to distinguish the Trojan Mount Ida from the taller Mount Ida on the island of Crete (2,456 m), which is more central to Greek mythology in general (e.g., the birthplace of Zeus) but is not the Ida of the Iliad. The Iliad's action is centered around Troy, and thus it refers to the nearby mountain in Anatolia (modern Turkey).\n*   **Exclusion Clause:** The most critical point is adhering to the \"After Mount Olympus\" clause, which makes this a question of finding the *second-tallest* mentioned mountain.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy listing the mountains mentioned in the Iliad, finding their modern elevations, and comparing them, we find that Mount Athos is the tallest after the excluded Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
