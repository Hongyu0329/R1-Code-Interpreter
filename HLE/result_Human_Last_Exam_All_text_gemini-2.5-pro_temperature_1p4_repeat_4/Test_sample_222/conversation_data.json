    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the 8-point DFT of the given sequence.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Define the Sequences**\n\n*   We are given the 4-point DFTs, X(k) and H(k), of two 4-point sequences, x(n) and h(n).\n    *   $x(n) \\xrightarrow{4-pt \\text{ DFT}} X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]$ for k=0,1,2,3\n    *   $h(n) \\xrightarrow{4-pt \\text{ DFT}} H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]$ for k=0,1,2,3\n*   We need to find the 8-point DFT, let's call it Y(k), for a new 8-point sequence y(n).\n*   The sequence y(n) is formed by interleaving x(n) and h(n):\n    $y(n) = \\{x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)\\}$\n\n**2. Relate the DFT of the Interleaved Sequence to Component DFTs**\n\nThis problem can be solved by using the decimation-in-time property of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in reverse. The sequence y(n) has its even-indexed terms defined by x(n) and its odd-indexed terms defined by h(n).\n\n*   $y(2m) = x(m)$ for m = 0, 1, 2, 3 (Even part)\n*   $y(2m+1) = h(m)$ for m = 0, 1, 2, 3 (Odd part)\n\nThe N-point DFT Y(k) of a sequence y(n) can be expressed in terms of the (N/2)-point DFTs of its even and odd parts. For N=8, the formula is:\n$Y(k) = \\text{DFT}\\{y(2m)\\} + W_8^k \\cdot \\text{DFT}\\{y(2m+1)\\}$\nwhere $W_N^k = e^{-j2\\pi k/N}$.\n\nSince the even part is x(n) and the odd part is h(n), their respective DFTs are X(k) and H(k). The formula becomes:\n$Y(k) = X(k \\pmod 4) + W_8^k H(k \\pmod 4)$\n\nFor k = 0, 1, 2, 3:\n$Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k H(k)$\n\nFor k = 4, 5, 6, 7, we use the property $W_8^{k+4} = W_8^k W_8^4 = -W_8^k$ and the periodicity of X(k) and H(k) (i.e., X(k+4)=X(k)).\n$Y(k+4) = X(k+4 \\pmod 4) + W_8^{k+4} H(k+4 \\pmod 4)$\n$Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k H(k)$ for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n**3. List Necessary Values**\n\n*   **X(k):** $[1, j, -1, -j]$\n*   **H(k):** $[0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]$\n*   **Twiddle Factors ($W_8^k$):**\n    *   $W_8^0 = e^0 = 1$\n    *   $W_8^1 = e^{-j\\pi/4} = \\cos(\\pi/4) - j\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n    *   $W_8^2 = e^{-j\\pi/2} = -j$\n    *   $W_8^3 = e^{-j3\\pi/4} = \\cos(3\\pi/4) - j\\sin(3\\pi/4) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Y(0):**\n    $Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1$\n*   **Y(1):**\n    $Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 H(1) = j + \\left(\\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1+j) = j + \\frac{1-j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = j + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} + j$\n*   **Y(2):**\n    $Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j$\n*   **Y(3):**\n    $Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 H(3) = -j + \\left(-\\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1-j) = -j - \\frac{1-j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -j - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2} - j$\n*   **Y(4):**\n    $Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1$\n*   **Y(5):**\n    $Y(5) = X(1) - W_8^1 H(1) = j - \\left(\\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1+j) = j - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2} + j$\n*   **Y(6):**\n    $Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 H(2) = -1 - (-j)(1) = -1 + j$\n*   **Y(7):**\n    $Y(7) = X(3) - W_8^3 H(3) = -j - \\left(-\\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(1-j) = -j + \\frac{1-j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -j + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} - j$\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nCombining all the calculated values, the 8-point DFT Y(k) is:\n$Y(k) = [Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), Y(6), Y(7)]$\n\n<<<[1, $\\sqrt{2}+j$, -1-j, $-\\sqrt{2}-j$, 1, $-\\sqrt{2}+j$, -1+j, $\\sqrt{2}-j$]>>>"
