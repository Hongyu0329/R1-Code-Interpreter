    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the principles of coiled-coil formation.**\nCoiled-coils consist of two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) are primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core positions, 'a' and 'd'. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues that pack together in the core of the structure, following a \"knobs-into-holes\" model.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the heptad repeat register in the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` (32 residues)\nTo find the register, we look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues spaced according to the heptad repeat. In an alpha-helix, residues at positions `i` and `i+3` or `i` and `i+4` are on the same face. The `a` and `d` positions are spaced by `d-c-b-a`, so the residues are `i` and `i-3`. The `d` and the next `a` position (`a'`) are spaced by `d-e-f-g-a'`, so the residues are `i` and `i+4`. This creates a repeating `(4, 3, 4, 3, ...)` spacing between the core residues (`d -> a' -> d' -> a''...`).\n\nLet's identify the positions of the large hydrophobic residues (I, L, W) in the sequence:\n*   I: 3, 10, 17, 24\n*   L: 7, 14, 21, 28\n*   W: 19\n\nLet's check the spacing between these residues:\n*   I(3) to L(7): difference of 4\n*   L(7) to I(10): difference of 3\n*   I(10) to L(14): difference of 4\n*   L(14) to I(17): difference of 3\n*   I(17) to L(21): difference of 4 (Note: W at 19 is not a core residue in this register)\n*   L(21) to I(24): difference of 3\n*   I(24) to L(28): difference of 4\n\nThis consistent `(4, 3)` spacing strongly indicates that we have correctly identified the core residues and their relative positions. This establishes the heptad repeat register.\n\n**Step 3: Assign residues to the 'a' and 'd' core positions.**\nBased on the `(d -> a')` spacing of 4 and `(a' -> d')` spacing of 3, we can assign the residues to their respective positions:\n*   **'d' positions:** I(3), I(10), I(17), I(24)\n*   **'a' positions:** L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28)\n\nSo, for the majority of the sequence, the 'a' positions are occupied by Leucine (L) and the 'd' positions are occupied by Isoleucine (I). (The pattern breaks down at the very end, with a K at position 31, which would be a 'd' position. This is common at the termini of coiled-coils and doesn't change the identity of the core.)\n\n**Step 4: Relate the core residue pattern to the oligomeric state.**\nThe \"knobs-into-holes\" packing efficiency is highly sensitive to the shape of the hydrophobic side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Isoleucine (I)** and Valine (V) are \"beta-branched\" (they have a branch at the second carbon of the side chain).\n*   **Leucine (L)** and Alanine (A) are not beta-branched.\n\nThe established rules for oligomerization based on packing are:\n*   **Dimers and Trimers:** Favour **beta-branched** residues (like Isoleucine) at the **'a' position** and **non-beta-branched** residues (like Leucine) at the **'d' position**. This allows the knob (from 'a') to pack efficiently into the hole on the partner helix.\n*   **Tetramers:** The packing geometry is different, with 'a' positions packing against 'd' positions on the adjacent helix. This arrangement favours the opposite pattern: **non-beta-branched** residues (like Leucine) at the **'a' position** and **beta-branched** residues (like Isoleucine) at the **'d' position**.\n*   **Pentamers and Hexamers:** These higher-order structures are typically stabilized by having polar (e.g., Glutamine, Q) or charged (e.g., Lysine, K; Glutamate, E) residues at one of the core positions to form an internal, stabilizing network.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the oligomeric state.**\nOur sequence has Leucine (non-beta-branched) at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine (beta-branched) at the 'd' positions.\n*   `a = L` (non-beta-branched)\n*   `d = I` (beta-branched)\n\nThis `a=L, d=I` pattern is the classic signature for a **tetrameric** coiled-coil. The sequence has a purely hydrophobic core, making pentamers or hexamers unlikely. The pattern is the reverse of what is preferred for dimers and trimers, making those states energetically unfavorable due to steric clashes and inefficient packing.\n\nTherefore, the protein would most likely form a tetramer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
