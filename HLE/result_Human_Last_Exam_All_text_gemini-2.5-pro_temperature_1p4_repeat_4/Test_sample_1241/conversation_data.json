    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the question\nThe problem presents a system of linear first-order ordinary differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman system (specifically, the forward equations) for a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The variables $P_i(t)$ represent the probability of the system being in state $i$ at time $t$. The coefficients $\\lambda_{ij}$ are the transition rates from state $i$ to state $j$.\n\nThe goal is to find the steady-state (or limiting) value of $P_0(t) + P_1(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. To find these, we assume the system reaches an equilibrium where the probabilities are no longer changing with time. This means we set the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero.\n\nThe system of equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_i$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Steady-State Condition**: The key to solving this problem is to use the steady-state condition, $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$, as $t \\to +\\infty$.\n2.  **Normalization**: The sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1. This provides an essential equation: $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$.\n3.  **Consistency**: The system of linear equations obtained from setting the derivatives to zero is always linearly dependent. One equation can be derived from the others. We must use the normalization condition to get a unique solution.\n4.  **Numerical Accuracy**: The given values of $\\lambda_{ij}$ are specific. It is important to perform calculations accurately. It might be beneficial to check if there are any simplifying relationships between the given rates.\n5.  **Final Target**: The question asks for the sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$, not the individual probabilities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Write down the steady-state equations.**\nBy setting $P_i'(t)=0$ and replacing $P_i(t)$ with $\\pi_i$ in the given system of differential equations, we get the balance equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 \\pi_0 + 0.65 \\pi_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 \\pi_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) \\pi_1 + 0.392 \\pi_2 + 0.008 \\pi_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 \\pi_2 - 0.008 \\pi_3$\n\nAdditionally, we have the normalization condition:\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Solve for the relationships between the probabilities.**\nWe can express $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ using equations (1), (3), and (4).\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 \\pi_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2 \\implies 0.4 \\pi_1 = 0.4 \\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 \\pi_2 = 0.008 \\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n\nSo, we find that $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\n(We can check that these relations are consistent with equation (2). Substituting them into eq (2) gives: $0.019(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1) - 1.05\\pi_1 + 0.392\\pi_1 + 0.008\\pi_1 = 0.65\\pi_1 - 1.05\\pi_1 + 0.4\\pi_1 = (0.65 - 1.05 + 0.4)\\pi_1 = 0$. The equation is satisfied.)\n\n**Step 3: Use the normalization condition to find the value of $\\pi_1$.**\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n\nNow, we calculate the term in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 = \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} = \\frac{0.707}{0.019}$\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$\\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the required sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.**\nWe need to find $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$. We know that $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$.\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right) \\pi_1$\nCalculate the term in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.669}{0.019}$\n\nSo, $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.019} \\pi_1$.\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\pi_1$ we found in Step 3:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\nThe term $0.019$ cancels out:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final numerical value.**\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get approximately 0.9463.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe quantity to find is $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nWe found $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1$, $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\nThe normalization equation is $\\pi_1 (\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 + 1 + 1) = 1$.\nThe required sum is $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\pi_1(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1)$.\nSo, $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3} = \\frac{\\frac{0.65+0.019}{0.019}}{\\frac{0.65+3(0.019)}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n\n$0.669 / 0.707 \\approx 0.946251768$\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
