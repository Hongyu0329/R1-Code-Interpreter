No. It is not possible. The two systems—Gödel's modal logic proof and the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics—are fundamentally incommensurable. Gödel's proof relies on axioms about metaphysical concepts like "positive properties" and "necessary existence," which have no defined or meaningful equivalent within the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (which consists of Hilbert spaces, operators, and probability theory). Attempting to do so would be a category error, like trying to prove a mathematical theorem using the rules of grammar.
