    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Task:** Identify a specific character.\n    *   **Criterion 1:** The character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Criterion 2:** The character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Criterion 3:** The description must contain a recognizable allusion to the myth of Romulus and Remus (founders of Rome, suckled by a she-wolf).\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:** The main characters are members of the Gothic tribe, the Wolfings. The primary candidates are those who have had direct contact with the Roman world.\n    *   **Thiodolf:** The war-leader of the Wolfings. While he fights Romans, the text doesn't focus on him visiting a Roman city for observation.\n    *   **Hall-Sun:** Thiodolf's daughter. She remains within the Goth's lands for the vast majority of the story.\n    *   **The Wood-Sun:** A divine being (a Valkyrie-like figure). She has supernatural knowledge but her experience is not described as a \"visit\" in the human sense.\n    *   **Otter:** A thrall (a servant or bondsman) of the Wolfings. His backstory is crucial: he was captured by the Romans as a boy and lived among them for a time before escaping and returning to his people. This makes him the most likely candidate to have firsthand knowledge of a Roman city.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Scene in the Text:** We need to find the part of the book where a character speaks about the Romans from personal experience. This occurs in **Chapter III, \"Otter tells of the Romans.\"** In this chapter, the Wolfing chieftains ask Otter to describe the Romans to help them prepare for the coming war.\n\n4.  **Analyze Otter's Description:** In his speech, Otter details his time among the Romans. He talks about their city, their military, and their customs. He then moves on to their religion.\n\n5.  **Check for the Romulus and Remus Allusion:** Within his description of Roman religion, Otter provides the key information.\n    *   He first describes a god with a thunderbolt, which is a clear reference to Jupiter.\n    *   He then says: \"But their oldest and most worshipped God, he who founded their City, was a Wolf; or at least the she-wolf was his mother... and he and his brother were nourished by the milk of the she-wolf...\"\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The character **Otter** fulfills all the criteria.\n    *   He visited a Roman city (as a captive).\n    *   In Chapter III, he describes Roman religious practices to the Wolfings.\n    *   His description explicitly mentions the city's founder and his brother being nourished by the milk of a she-wolf, which is the core of the Romulus and Remus myth.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Perspective:** Otter describes these practices from the outside perspective of a Goth. He does not use the Roman names \"Romulus,\" \"Remus,\" or \"Jupiter,\" but describes them in terms that he and his audience would understand (e.g., \"the God... [who] holdeth a thunderbolt\"). This fits the question's phrasing, \"in a way that readers will recognize.\"\n*   **Narrative Purpose:** Otter's story serves as a piece of intelligence-gathering for the Wolfings, grounding the fantastical elements of the story in a historical conflict.\n*   **Author's Touch:** William Morris adds a detail where Otter claims the she-wolf was \"a she-wolf of the Goths,\" creating a mythical link between the two warring peoples.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe character who visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices, including a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus, is **Otter**.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
