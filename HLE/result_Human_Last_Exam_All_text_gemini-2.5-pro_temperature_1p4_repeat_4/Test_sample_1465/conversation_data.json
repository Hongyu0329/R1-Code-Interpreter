    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Fundamental Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization**\n\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acids at the core positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The `a` and `d` positions form the hydrophobic core that holds the helices together. The specific pairing of residues at these positions dictates the geometry and, therefore, the number of helices in the bundle.\n\n*   **Heptad Repeat and Core Positions:** A coiled-coil sequence is characterized by a repeating pattern of 7 amino acids, `abcdefg`. The core positions `a` and `d` are separated by two residues in the sequence (e.g., if `a` is at position `i`, `d` is at position `i+3`).\n*   **Key Oligomerization Motifs (Rules for `a,d` core pairs):**\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by `a=I, d=L` or `a=I, d=A`. An Asparagine (`N`) at an `a` position is also a very strong dimer-specifying element.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored by `a=L, d=I` or `a=L, d=L`. Also favored by Threonine (`T`) at a `d` position.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by `a=I, d=I` or `a=I, d=Q` (polar Glutamine `Q` in the core).\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence**\n\n**1. Sequence: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Identify Core Residues:** We look for a pair of hydrophobic residues separated by 2 other residues that match a known motif. The residues `I` at position 2 and `A` at position 5 fit this pattern (`5-2 = 3` position separation).\n*   **Assign Phasing:** This sets position 2 as `a` and position 5 as `d`.\n*   **Analyze Core Motif:** The core is `a=I` (Isoleucine) and `d=A` (Alanine).\n*   **Determine Oligomeric State:** The `(I, A)` pair is a well-characterized motif for forming **Dimers (2)**.\n\n**2. Sequence: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Identify Core Residues:** The residues `I` at position 2 and `L` at position 5 fit the pattern (`5-2 = 3`).\n*   **Assign Phasing:** This sets `a`=position 2 and `d`=position 5.\n*   **Analyze Core Motif:** The core is predominantly `a=I` and `d=L` (Leucine). In one repeat (`ENAALK...`), the `a` position is occupied by `N` (Asparagine).\n*   **Determine Oligomeric State:** The `(I, L)` pair is a canonical motif for **Dimers (2)**. The presence of `N` at an `a` position further reinforces the dimer prediction, as it forms a specific inter-helical hydrogen bond unique to the dimer interface. So this sequence is a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**3. Sequence: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Identify Core Residues:** The residues `I` at position 2 and `I` at position 5 fit the pattern (`5-2 = 3`).\n*   **Assign Phasing:** This sets `a`=position 2 and `d`=position 5.\n*   **Analyze Core Motif:** The core is `a=I` and `d=I`.\n*   **Determine Oligomeric State:** The `(I, I)` pair is a classic motif that forms **Tetramers (4)**. The bulky, beta-branched side chains of Isoleucine pack efficiently in a tetrameric arrangement. This sequence is a **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n**4. Sequence: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Identify Core Residues:** The residue `I` is at position 2 and `Q` (Glutamine) is at position 5. They fit the `a,d` spacing (`5-2=3`).\n*   **Assign Phasing:** This sets `a`=position 2 and `d`=position 5.\n*   **Analyze Core Motif:** The core is `a=I` and `d=Q`.\n*   **Determine Oligomeric State:** This `(I, Q)` motif, with a polar residue in the core, is a well-known signal for a **Tetramer (4)**, where the glutamine side chains form a polar ladder in the center of the bundle.\n*   ***Note on Discrepancy:*** While our analysis indicates a tetramer, this result does not lead to a matching answer choice when combined with the other robust predictions. The closest answer choice, `D`, lists this sequence as a Dimer (2). This suggests a possible error in the question's sequence or the answer choices. However, proceeding with the other highly confident predictions will point to the most likely intended answer.\n\n**5. Sequence: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Identify Core Residues:** The residue `I` is at position 2 and `T` (Threonine) is at position 5, fitting the `a,d` spacing (`5-2=3`).\n*   **Assign Phasing:** This sets `a`=position 2 and `d`=position 5.\n*   **Analyze Core Motif:** The core is `a=I` and `d=T`.\n*   **Determine Oligomeric State:** Threonine at a core `d` position is known to destabilize the packing of a dimer due to its beta-branched structure and its polar -OH group. This disruption favors an alternative packing geometry, specifically that of a **Trimer (3)**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOur analysis yields the following oligomeric states:\n*   Sequence 1: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 3: **4** (Tetramer)\n*   Sequence 4: **4** (Tetramer) - *This is the point of conflict with the answer key.*\n*   Sequence 5: **3** (Trimer)\n\nOur predicted series is `2, 2, 4, 4, 3`. Let's compare this to the available options. The option that aligns best is **D**, which is `2, 2, 4, 2, 3`. It matches perfectly on 4 out of the 5 sequences. The discrepancy for sequence 4 is most likely due to a typo in the problem's sequence data or the options. Given the strong evidence for the other four predictions, `D` is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
