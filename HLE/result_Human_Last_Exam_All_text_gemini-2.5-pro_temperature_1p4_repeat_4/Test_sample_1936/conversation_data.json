    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of a Group\n\nA group is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of elements together with a binary operation. For a set `G` and a binary operation `·`, the pair `(G, ·)` is a group if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result of the operation, `a · b`, is also in `G`. The problem statement says `·` is a binary operation *on G*, which implies the closure property is already satisfied.\n2.  **Associativity:** For all `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`. The existence of an identity element implies that a group cannot be an empty set.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (the inverse of `a`, often denoted `a⁻¹`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest number of elements `n` in a set `G` for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is *not* a group. This means the structure must fail at least one of the axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the possibilities for n, starting from the smallest possible values.\n\nSince a group must be non-empty (due to the identity element axiom), the smallest possible size `n` for a set `G` that could potentially be a group is `n=1`. We will test the cases for `n=1`, `n=2`, and so on, to find the first `n` where it's possible to construct a non-group structure.\n\n#### Case: n = 1\n*   Let the set be `G = {a}`.\n*   A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G x G` to `G`. The set `G x G` has only one element: `(a, a)`. So, there is only one possible binary operation we can define: `a · a = a`.\n*   Let's check if `({a}, ·)` is a group:\n    *   **Closure:** `a · a = a`, which is in `G`. This holds.\n    *   **Associativity:** We need to check if `(a · a) · a = a · (a · a)`.\n        *   Left side: `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`.\n        *   Right side: `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`.\n        *   Since `a = a`, associativity holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need an element `e` in `G` such that `e · a = a`. The only element is `a` itself. Let's test if `a` can be the identity: `a · a = a`. Yes, `a` is the identity element.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For the element `a`, we need an inverse `b` such that `a · b = a` (since `a` is the identity). The only choice for `b` is `a`. We check `a · a = a`, which is true. So, the inverse of `a` is `a`.\n*   **Conclusion for n=1:** All four group axioms are satisfied. Therefore, any set with one element and a binary operation must be a group (this is known as the trivial group). So, `n` cannot be 1.\n\n#### Case: n = 2\n*   Let the set be `G = {a, b}`.\n*   We need to determine if there exists at least one binary operation `·` on `G` such that `(G, ·)` is *not* a group. We don't need to check all possible operations; we just need to find one counterexample.\n*   Let's try to construct an operation that fails one of the axioms. Consider the following simple operation: for any elements `x` and `y` in `G`, let `x · y = a`.\n*   This operation can be represented by the following multiplication table (Cayley table):\n| · | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| **a** | a | a |\n| **b** | a | a |\n\n*   Now, let's check if `({a, b}, ·)` is a group with this operation:\n    *   **Closure:** All results in the table are `a`, which is in `G`. This holds.\n    *   **Associativity:** `(x · y) · z = a · z = a`. And `x · (y · z) = x · a = a`. So, `(x · y) · z = x · (y · z)` for all `x, y, z` in `G`. Associativity holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need to find an element `e` such that `e · x = x` for all `x` in `G`.\n        *   Let's test if `a` is the identity. We would need `a · b = b`. But from our table, `a · b = a`. So, `a` is not the identity element.\n        *   Let's test if `b` is the identity. We would need `b · a = a`. This is true from our table. But we also need `b · b = b`. From our table, `b · b = a`. So, `b` is not the identity element.\n    *   Since there is no identity element, this structure is not a group.\n\n*   **Conclusion for n=2:** We have successfully found a set `G` with `n=2` elements and a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\n*   For `n=1`, any set with one element under a binary operation is always a group.\n*   For `n=2`, we found an example of a set with a binary operation that is not a group.\n*   Therefore, the smallest number `n` for which such a set and operation exist is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
