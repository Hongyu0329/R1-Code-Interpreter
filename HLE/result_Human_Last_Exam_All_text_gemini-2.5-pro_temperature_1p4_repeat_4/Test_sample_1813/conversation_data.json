    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Concept of Generalized Markov Numbers and Associated Continued Fractions**\n\nThe theory of Markov numbers can be generalized from the classical equation \\(x^2+y^2+z^2 = 3xyz\\) to a broader context involving rational numbers. For any rational number \\(p/q\\), there is an associated generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\). This number is intrinsically linked to a specific quadratic irrational number, whose properties (like its Lagrange number) define \\(m_{p/q}\\). The question asks for the continued fraction expansion of this specific quadratic irrational number associated with \\(p/q = 4/7\\).\n\nThe standard construction for this associated continued fraction is based on the finite continued fraction of the rational number itself. If a rational number \\(r\\) has a simple continued fraction expansion \\(r = [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\), the associated quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\(\\alpha_r\\), is given by the periodic continued fraction whose repeating block is a palindrome formed by the sequence of partial quotients \\((a_1, \\dots, a_n)\\) followed by its reverse.\nThat is, \\(\\alpha_r = [0; \\overline{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_2, a_1}]\\).\n\n**2. Compute the Continued Fraction of the Rational Number 4/7**\n\nWe use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the partial quotients for \\(4/7\\).\n\n*   **Step 2.1:** Start with the fraction \\(4/7\\). Since it's less than 1, the integer part is 0. We find the first partial quotient by taking the reciprocal:\n    \\[ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} \\]\n*   **Step 2.2:** Decompose \\(7/4\\) into its integer and fractional parts:\n    \\[ \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n    The first partial quotient is \\(a_1 = 1\\).\n*   **Step 2.3:** Take the reciprocal of the new fractional part, \\(3/4\\):\n    \\[ \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}} \\]\n*   **Step 2.4:** Decompose \\(4/3\\):\n    \\[ \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n    The second partial quotient is \\(a_2 = 1\\).\n*   **Step 2.5:** Take the reciprocal of the final fractional part, \\(1/3\\):\n    \\[ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n    The third partial quotient is \\(a_3 = 3\\). The fractional part is now 0, so the algorithm terminates.\n\nSo, the continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The sequence of partial quotients is \\(U = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n\n**3. Construct the Associated Periodic Continued Fraction**\n\n*   **Step 3.1:** Identify the sequence of partial quotients from Step 2:\n    \\(U = (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n*   **Step 3.2:** Find the reverse of this sequence:\n    \\(U^T = (a_3, a_2, a_1) = (3, 1, 1)\\).\n*   **Step 3.3:** Create the repeating block for the associated quadratic irrational by concatenating \\(U\\) and \\(U^T\\):\n    Repeating block = \\((U, U^T) = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)\\).\n\n**4. Write the Final Answer**\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is a purely periodic continued fraction with an integer part of 0 and the repeating block found in Step 3.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\([0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]\\)\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Correct Definition:** It is crucial to use the correct definition that connects a rational number to its associated periodic continued fraction. The palindromic construction \\([0; \\overline{U, U^T}]\\) is the standard one in this context.\n*   **Accuracy of the Euclidean Algorithm:** The entire result depends on the correct computation of the partial quotients for the given rational number. A small error here will lead to a completely different final answer. Checking the calculation is important: \\([0; 1, 1, 3] = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + 1/3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = 4/7\\). The calculation is correct.\n*   **Correct Construction of the Repeating Block:** The repeating block is not simply the sequence repeated (\\(\\overline{U,U}\\)) but the sequence followed by its reverse (\\(\\overline{U,U^T}\\)). This palindromic nature is a key feature.\n\nBy following these steps carefully, we arrive at the final result.\n\n<<<\\([0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]\\)>>>"
