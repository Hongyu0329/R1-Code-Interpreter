    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find all possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe test for simple roots. Let's try roots of the form $\\sqrt{a}$.\nIf $x = \\sqrt{a}$, then $f(\\sqrt{a}) = a^3\\sqrt{a} - 2a^2\\sqrt{a} - 9a\\sqrt{a} + 3a + 18\\sqrt{a} - 6 = 0$.\nThis equation can be separated into parts with and without $\\sqrt{a}$:\n$\\sqrt{a}(a^3 - 2a^2 - 9a + 18) + (3a - 6) = 0$.\nFor this to hold, both terms must be zero for a rational $a$.\nFrom the second term, $3a - 6 = 0 \\implies a = 2$.\nWe check if $a=2$ satisfies the first term: $2^3 - 2(2^2) - 9(2) + 18 = 8 - 8 - 18 + 18 = 0$.\nIt does. Thus, $x=\\sqrt{2}$ is a root of $f(x)$. Since the coefficients of $f(x)$ are rational, $x=-\\sqrt{2}$ must also be a root. Therefore, $(x-\\sqrt{2})(x+\\sqrt{2}) = x^2 - 2$ is a factor of $f(x)$.\n\nWe perform polynomial division to find the other factor:\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting field of $g(x)$ and the splitting field of $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois groups of the factors**\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    The roots are $\\pm \\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n*   **For $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    We first check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Consider the polynomial $h(x+3) = (x+3)^5 - 9(x+3) + 3$.\n    The constant term is $h(3) = 3^5 - 9(3) + 3 = 243 - 27 + 3 = 219$.\n    $219 = 3 \\times 73$. It is divisible by the prime $p=3$ but not by $p^2=9$.\n    The other coefficients of $h(x+3)$ are all divisible by 3, as $h(x+3) \\equiv x^5 \\pmod{3}$.\n    By Eisenstein's criterion with $p=3$ applied to $h(x+3)$, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n    To find the Galois group of $h(x)$, let's determine the number of real roots.\n    $h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    Let $c = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    $h(c) = c^5 - 9c + 3 = c(c^4) - 9c + 3 = c(9/5) - 9c + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}c$. Since $c = \\sqrt[4]{1.8} > 1$, $h(c) < 3 - 7.2 < 0$.\n    $h(-c) = (-c)^5 - 9(-c) + 3 = -c^5 + 9c + 3 = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}c > 0$.\n    Since there is a positive local maximum and a negative local minimum, $h(x)$ has 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n\n    For an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ with exactly $p-2$ real roots, its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$, so the Galois group of $h(x)$ is $G_h = S_5$. Let $K_2$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$, so $\\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The order of the group is $|S_5|=120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of $f(x)$**\n\nThe splitting field is $K = K_1 K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\text{roots of } h(x))$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe group is the full direct product if $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a quadratic extension. $K_2$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ where $D$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\nThe sign of the discriminant is $(-1)^s$, where $s$ is the number of pairs of complex roots. Here $s=1$, so $D < 0$.\nFor $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, we would need $D=2k^2$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. This is impossible as $D<0$ and $2k^2 \\ge 0$. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, and their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo, $G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of $G$ is $|G| = |C_2| \\times |S_5| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate fields**\n\nA normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ corresponds, by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, to a normal subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H| = [G:H]$.\nWe need to find all normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group), and $S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $G=C_2 \\times S_5$ include:\n1.  **Product subgroups:** $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\unlhd C_2$ and $N_2 \\unlhd S_5$.\n    *   $H = C_2 \\times S_5$ (corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$, degree 1)\n    *   $H = C_2 \\times A_5$, $|H|=2 \\cdot 60=120$. Index is $240/120=2$.\n    *   $H = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, $|H|=2$. Index is $240/2=120$.\n    *   $H = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$, $|H|=120$. Index is $240/120=2$.\n    *   $H = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$, $|H|=60$. Index is $240/60=4$.\n    *   $H = \\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (corresponds to $L=K$, degree 240)\n\n2.  **\"Diagonal\" subgroups:** These exist when $C_2$ and $S_5$ share a common non-trivial quotient group. The only such case is $C_2 \\cong S_5/A_5$.\n    This gives rise to one additional normal subgroup, which can be described as the kernel of the homomorphism $\\psi: C_2 \\times S_5 \\to C_2$ given by $\\psi(c, \\sigma) = c \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$, where we identify the group $C_2$ with $\\{\\pm 1\\}$.\n    $H = \\ker(\\psi) = \\{(c,\\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid c=\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)\\}$.\n    This subgroup contains $|A_5|=60$ elements of the form $(1, \\sigma)$ with $\\sigma \\in A_5$, and $|S_5\\setminus A_5|=60$ elements of the form $(-1, \\sigma)$ with $\\sigma \\notin A_5$.\n    The order of this subgroup is $|H|=60+60=120$.\n    The index is $[G:H] = 240/120=2$.\n\n**Step 5: List the possible degrees**\n\nThe proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ give rise to the desired intermediate fields $L$. We list their indices:\n*   $H = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$ ($|H|=2$) gives degree $[G:H] = 120$.\n*   $H = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$ ($|H|=60$) gives degree $[G:H] = 4$.\n*   $H = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$ ($|H|=120$) gives degree $[G:H] = 2$.\n*   $H = C_2 \\times A_5$ ($|H|=120$) gives degree $[G:H] = 2$.\n*   The diagonal subgroup $H$ ($|H|=120$) gives degree $[G:H] = 2$.\n\nCollecting the unique values for the degrees, we find the set of all possible degrees for such extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
