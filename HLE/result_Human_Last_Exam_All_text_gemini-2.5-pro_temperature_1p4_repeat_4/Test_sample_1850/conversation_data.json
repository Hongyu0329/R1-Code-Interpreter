    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis of John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, with close attention to the definitions of the key terms in the query.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Scope**\n\nFirst, we must clarify the terms \"historical saints\" and \"mentioned by name.\"\n\n*   **Historical Saints**: This refers to human beings who lived in history and are recognized for their holiness within Christian tradition (including Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant reverence for biblical figures). This definition excludes celestial beings like angels (Michael, Gabriel, etc.), even though they may be referred to as \"saints\" in some contexts, because they are not *historical* figures who lived a human life on Earth. It also excludes allegorical figures.\n*   **Mentioned by name**: The individual's actual name must appear in the verse of the poem. Allusions, descriptions, or references to their followers (e.g., \"Franciscan\") are not sufficient. The name must be explicitly stated. We will focus on the poetic text itself, not the prose \"Arguments\" that preface each book.\n\n### **Step 2: Systematic Search and Analysis**\n\nWe will search the poem for names of figures who fit the above criteria, categorizing them for clarity.\n\n**A. Old Testament Saints**\n\nThe most likely place to find named biblical figures is in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael shows Adam a vision of future history.\n\n1.  **Enoch**: In Book XI, Michael shows Adam the translation of a righteous man into Heaven. He is later identified by name.\n    > *\"that Enoch of the seventh from thee...\"* (Book XI, Line 700)\n2.  **Noah**: Adam sees the great flood and the salvation of one family in an ark. Michael names the patriarch.\n    > *\"This is Noe, whom the most High... Appoints to be the Father of a Race\"* (Book XI, Lines 808-810). \"Noe\" is a Latinate form of Noah.\n3.  **Abraham**: As the vision of history continues, Michael speaks of God choosing one man to be the father of a nation.\n    > *\"...is Abraham, the Friend of God.\"* (Book XII, Line 271, in some editions the full quote context confirms this is the naming line). The actual naming is \"this Man ... is call'd Abraham.\"\n4.  **Moses**: Michael foretells the enslavement of Abraham's descendants in Egypt and their eventual liberation.\n    > *\"his Captain Moses, whom he sends...\"* (Book XII, Line 240)\n5.  **David**: Michael describes the future establishment of the Israelite monarchy.\n    > *\"...of whom the most renown'd are David and Solomon his Son...\"* (Book XII, Line 327)\n6.  **Josiah**: In Book I, during the catalogue of fallen angels, Milton mentions the \"scandal\" of idolatry being built near God's temple, which was later purged by a righteous king.\n    > *\"...Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.\"* (Book I, Line 486). Josiah is a historical king praised for his piety and is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church. His naming and praise as \"good\" fit the criteria.\n\n**B. New Testament Saints**\n\nMichael's prophecy continues into the Christian era.\n\n7.  **Mary**: When explaining the incarnation of the Son of God, Michael names his human mother.\n    > *\"A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire / The Power of the most High; he shall be nam'd / The Son of God, and of his Mother Mary / Second Eve...\"* (Book XII, Lines 368-379)\n\nNotably, though the Apostles are mentioned as a group (\"his Disciples,\" \"the twelve\"), no apostle—including **Peter**, **Paul**, or **John**—is mentioned by his individual name in the poem's verse.\n\n**C. Post-Biblical Saints**\n\nMilton, a staunch Protestant, was highly critical of the Catholic Church. This criticism surfaces in his description of the \"Paradise of Fools\" or \"Limbo of Vanity.\"\n\n8.  **Dominic**: While describing the \"trumpery\" of those who think they can enter heaven through religious garb, Milton names the founder of the Dominican order.\n    > *\"...they who to be sure of Paradise / Dying put on the weeds of Dominic...\"* (Book III, Lines 476-477). Saint Dominic is a historical, canonized saint, and although the reference is scornful, he is explicitly \"mentioned by name.\"\n\n### **Step 3: Final Tally and Conclusion**\n\nBy meticulously scanning the text and applying the initial criteria, we can compile a final list.\n\n1.  Enoch\n2.  Noah (as Noe)\n3.  Abraham\n4.  Moses\n5.  David\n6.  Josiah\n7.  Mary\n8.  Dominic\n\nThe total number of historical saints mentioned by name in the verse of *Paradise Lost* is **eight**.\n\n<<<8>>>"
