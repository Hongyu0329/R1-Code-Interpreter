    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\n\n*   **Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph is constructed from two identical complete graphs (cliques) that are connected by a single edge (a bridge).\n*   **10-Node Configuration:** With a total of 10 nodes, the most standard barbell graph structure consists of two complete graphs of 5 nodes each ($K_5$).\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Let the two cliques be $C_1$ and $C_2$. Both are $K_5$, so they each have 5 nodes. The total number of nodes is $5 + 5 = 10$.\n    *   The cliques are connected by a single edge. Let's say this edge connects node $u$ from clique $C_1$ to node $v$ from clique $C_2$.\n*   **The Bottleneck Edge:** The edge $(u, v)$ is the \"bottleneck edge\" because it is the sole connection between the two halves of the graph.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process\n\nThis process involves two stages of uniform random selection in each step:\n1.  **Node Selection:** One node is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all nodes in the graph. Since there are 10 nodes, the probability of selecting any specific node is $1/10$.\n2.  **Neighbor Selection:** The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to gossip with. If a selected node $i$ has $d(i)$ neighbors (its degree), it will choose any specific neighbor with a probability of $1/d(i)$.\n\nThe \"sampling of an edge\" occurs when a node and one of its neighbors are chosen in this process. The question asks for the probability that the chosen edge is the bottleneck edge $(u, v)$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Degrees of the Nodes\n\nTo find the neighbor selection probabilities, we first need to determine the degree of each node in the graph.\n*   **Nodes `u` and `v` (connected to the bottleneck):**\n    *   Node $u$ is in the clique $C_1$ (a $K_5$). It is connected to the other 4 nodes in $C_1$.\n    *   It is also connected to node $v$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of node $u$ is $d(u) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   By symmetry, the degree of node $v$ is also $d(v) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n*   **Other Nodes (not connected to the bottleneck):**\n    *   There are $5 - 1 = 4$ other nodes in clique $C_1$ and $4$ other nodes in clique $C_2$. Total of 8 such nodes.\n    *   Any one of these nodes is part of a $K_5$ clique and is only connected to the other 4 nodes within that same clique.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of any of these 8 nodes is 4.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge\n\nThe bottleneck edge $(u, v)$ can be sampled in one of two mutually exclusive ways in a single gossiping step:\n1.  Node $u$ is selected, and it chooses to gossip with its neighbor $v$.\n2.  Node $v$ is selected, and it chooses to gossip with its neighbor $u$.\n\nWe calculate the probability of each event and add them together.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 1 (u selects v):**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $u$ is $P(\\text{select } u) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given that $u$ is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor $v$ is $P(u \\text{ chooses } v) = 1/d(u) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability of this event is the product: $P(\\text{Event 1}) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Probability of Event 2 (v selects u):**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $v$ is $P(\\text{select } v) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given that $v$ is selected, the probability of it choosing neighbor $u$ is $P(v \\text{ chooses } u) = 1/d(v) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability of this event is the product: $P(\\text{Event 2}) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n    *   $P(\\text{sample bottleneck}) = P(\\text{Event 1}) + P(\\text{Event 2}) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSimplifying the fraction, the final probability is $1/25$.\n\n$1/25 = 0.04$\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
