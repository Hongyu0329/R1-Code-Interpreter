    "This problem requires us to evaluate a quantum mechanical integral, specifically a matrix element of the operator $\\frac{1}{r}$ between two 1s Slater-type orbitals (STOs), denoted as $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Identify Careful Points\n\n1.  **Define the 1s Slater Orbital:**\n    A general Slater-type orbital (STO) has the form $\\psi_{n,l,m}(\\mathbf{r}) = N Y_l^m(\\theta, \\varphi) r^{n-1} e^{-\\zeta r}$. For a 1s orbital, we have $n=1, l=0, m=0$. The spherical harmonic $Y_0^0$ is a constant, $1/\\sqrt{4\\pi}$. Thus, the unnormalized 1s STO is proportional to $e^{-\\zeta r}$.\n    To find the normalization constant $N$, we enforce the condition $\\langle \\phi | \\phi \\rangle = 1$.\n    The normalized 1s STO centered at the origin is:\n    \\[ \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r} \\]\n    where $\\zeta$ is the orbital exponent, which determines the \"size\" of the orbital.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Notation $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$:**\n    This notation represents a matrix element of the operator $\\frac{1}{r}$. The operator typically corresponds to the Coulomb potential of a nucleus with charge Z=1 (in atomic units). There are several possible interpretations for what $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ represent:\n\n    *   **Case A: One-center, diagonal element.** $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are the *same* orbital, centered at the same point (the origin). So, $\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi$. This integral, $\\langle \\phi | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi \\rangle$, is the expectation value of the operator $\\frac{1}{r}$. This corresponds to the average potential energy of an electron in orbital $\\phi$ due to a nucleus of charge +1 at the origin.\n    *   **Case B: One-center, off-diagonal element.** $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are different 1s STOs, but centered at the same origin. They would differ by their orbital exponents, i.e., $\\zeta_i \\neq \\zeta_j$. This type of integral appears in variational calculations using a basis set of STOs.\n    *   **Case C: Two-center element.** $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are 1s STOs centered on different nuclei (e.g., in a molecule). The operator $\\frac{1}{r}$ would be the potential due to one of the nuclei. These are known as two-center nuclear attraction integrals.\n\n3.  **Choosing the most plausible interpretation:**\n    The phrase \"for a 1s Slater orbital\" (singular) suggests we are asked for a fundamental property of a single such orbital. The most fundamental and physically significant quantity is its expectation value for the potential energy, which is Case A. While the notation with indices $i$ and $j$ might suggest they can be different, it is often used formally even when a diagonal element is implied. Without further context (like specifying a molecule or a basis set), Case A is the most reasonable and standard interpretation.\n\nTherefore, we will evaluate the expectation value $\\langle \\phi | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi \\rangle$ for a single 1s Slater orbital.\n\n### Step 2: Step-by-Step Evaluation\n\nWe aim to calculate the integral:\n\\[ I = \\left\\langle \\phi \\left| \\frac{1}{r} \\right| \\phi \\right\\rangle = \\int_{\\text{all space}} \\phi^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\frac{1}{r} \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) d\\tau \\]\n\n**Step 2.1: Set up the integral.**\nSubstitute the normalized 1s STO, $\\phi(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r}$. Since it is a real function, $\\phi^* = \\phi$. The volume element in spherical coordinates is $d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\varphi$.\n\\[ I = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right) \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right) r^2 \\sin\\theta d\\varphi d\\theta dr \\]\nCombine the terms:\n\\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{-2\\zeta r} \\frac{r^2}{r} \\sin\\theta d\\varphi d\\theta dr \\]\n\\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} r e^{-2\\zeta r} \\sin\\theta d\\varphi d\\theta dr \\]\n\n**Step 2.2: Separate and evaluate the angular part.**\nThe integral can be separated into a radial part (involving $r$) and an angular part (involving $\\theta$ and $\\varphi$).\n\\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\left( \\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin\\theta d\\varphi d\\theta \\right) \\]\nThe angular part is the integral over the entire solid angle:\n\\[ \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\varphi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta = [\\varphi]_0^{2\\pi} [-\\cos\\theta]_0^\\pi = (2\\pi) (-(-1) - (-1)) = (2\\pi)(2) = 4\\pi \\]\n\n**Step 2.3: Evaluate the radial part.**\nSubstitute the result for the angular part back into the expression for $I$:\n\\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} (4\\pi) \\left( \\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr \\right) = 4\\zeta^3 \\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr \\]\nThe remaining integral is a standard form known as a Gamma function integral: $\\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-ax} dx = \\frac{n!}{a^{n+1}}$.\nFor our integral, $x=r$, $n=1$, and $a=2\\zeta$.\n\\[ \\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr = \\frac{1!}{(2\\zeta)^{1+1}} = \\frac{1}{(2\\zeta)^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2} \\]\n\n**Step 2.4: Combine all parts to get the final answer.**\nSubstitute the value of the radial integral back into the expression for $I$:\n\\[ I = 4\\zeta^3 \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2} \\right) \\]\n\\[ I = \\zeta \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe value of the integral $\\langle \\phi | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi \\rangle$ for a 1s Slater orbital is equal to the orbital exponent $\\zeta$.\n\n<<<\\zeta>>>"
