    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to compute the determinant of the 3x3 matrix \\( A \\) provided in the question.\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Analyze the Context:** The question mentions this matrix as \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". This information serves to identify the specific matrix in a particular mathematical or physical context. However, the matrix \\( A \\) is explicitly given. Therefore, the calculation of the determinant depends only on the entries of \\( A \\), and the contextual information does not alter the matrix itself.\n\n3.  **Choose a Method for Calculation:** There are several methods to compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.\n    *   Method A: Checking for Linear Dependence of Rows/Columns.\n    *   Method B: The Rule of Sarrus (for 3x3 matrices only).\n    *   Method C: Cofactor Expansion.\n    *   Method D: Row Reduction to Echelon Form.\n\n    We will use Method A as it is often the quickest if applicable, and then verify with Method B.\n\n### Careful Points and Execution\n\n#### Method A: Checking for Linear Dependence\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A square matrix has a determinant of zero if and only if its rows or columns are linearly dependent. This means one row/column can be expressed as a linear combination of the others, or more generally, there's a non-trivial linear combination of rows/columns that equals the zero vector.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    Let \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) be the columns of matrix \\( A \\).\n    \\[\n    C_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n    C_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n    C_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n    Let's compute the sum of these column vectors:\n    \\[\n    C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 + (-1) + (-1) \\\\ -1 + 2 + (-1) \\\\ -1 + (-1) + 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n    Since the sum of the column vectors is the zero vector, the columns are linearly dependent.\n    Therefore, the determinant of the matrix \\( A \\) must be 0.\n\n#### Method B: Verification using the Rule of Sarrus\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This method is a specific algorithm for 3x3 matrices. It involves summing the products of the main diagonals and subtracting the sum of the products of the anti-diagonals. Be careful with arithmetic and signs.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    1.  Write the matrix and repeat the first two columns to its right:\n        \\[\n        \\begin{array}{ccc|cc}\n        2 & -1 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n        -1 & 2 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\\\\n        -1 & -1 & 2 & -1 & -1\n        \\end{array}\n        \\]\n    2.  Calculate the sum of the products of the diagonals from top-left to bottom-right:\n        \\[\n        (2)(2)(2) + (-1)(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(-1) = 8 - 1 - 1 = 6\n        \\]\n    3.  Calculate the sum of the products of the diagonals from top-right to bottom-left:\n        \\[\n        (-1)(2)(-1) + (2)(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n        \\]\n    4.  Subtract the second sum from the first sum:\n        \\[\n        \\det(A) = 6 - 6 = 0\n        \\]\n    Both methods confirm that the determinant is 0.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe determinant of the matrix is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + 1((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - 1((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 6 - 3 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n= 0\n\\]\n\n<<<0>>>"
