    "This problem asks for the computation of the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Manifold:**\n    The manifold in question is $X = \\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. This is the topological product of two manifolds, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n    *   $\\Sigma_g$ denotes a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$.\n    *   $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ is a closed, oriented surface of genus 31. Its dimension is $\\dim(M) = 2$.\n    *   $N = \\Sigma_{17}$ is a closed, oriented surface of genus 17. Its dimension is $\\dim(N) = 2$.\n    *   The product manifold $X$ is a closed, oriented 4-dimensional manifold.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of Simplicial Volume:**\n    The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented $n$-manifold $M$, denoted by $||M||$, is defined as:\n    $||M|| = \\inf \\left\\{ \\sum_{i=1}^k |c_i| \\, \\middle| \\, \\sum_{i=1}^k c_i \\sigma_i \\in Z_n(M; \\mathbb{R}) \\text{ represents the fundamental class } [M]_\\mathbb{R} \\in H_n(M;\\mathbb{R}) \\right\\}$\n    where the $\\sigma_i$ are singular $n$-simplices and $c_i$ are real coefficients. It measures the minimal \"cost\" in terms of $L^1$-norm to represent the fundamental class of the manifold.\n\n3.  **Simplicial Volume of the Factors:**\n    For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$, its simplicial volume is given by a well-known formula related to its Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$.\n    *   If $g=0$ (sphere $S^2$), $||\\Sigma_0|| = 0$.\n    *   If $g=1$ (torus $T^2$), $||\\Sigma_1|| = 0$.\n    *   If $g \\ge 2$, the surface is hyperbolic, and its simplicial volume is non-zero: $||\\Sigma_g|| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2|2 - 2g| = 4g - 4$.\n\n    Using this formula for our factors:\n    *   For $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ (with genus $g=31 \\ge 2$):\n        $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n    *   For $N = \\Sigma_{17}$ (with genus $g'=17 \\ge 2$):\n        $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n    Both factor manifolds have a non-zero simplicial volume.\n\n4.  **Simplicial Volume of a Product Manifold:**\n    A key theorem by Gromov and Thurston governs the simplicial volume of product manifolds. While there's an inequality relating the product's volume to the factors' volumes ($||M \\times N|| \\le \\binom{\\dim M + \\dim N}{\\dim M} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$), a more powerful result gives the precise value in most cases.\n\n    **Theorem (Gromov, Thurston):** If $M$ and $N$ are closed, connected, oriented manifolds of positive dimension, then the simplicial volume of their product is zero.\n    $$||M \\times N|| = 0$$\n\n5.  **Apply the Theorem to the Specific Case:**\n    We must verify that our manifolds $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$ satisfy the conditions of the theorem.\n    *   $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ is a closed, connected, oriented manifold. Its dimension is 2, which is positive.\n    *   $N = \\Sigma_{17}$ is a closed, connected, oriented manifold. Its dimension is 2, which is positive.\n\n    Both manifolds satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem. Therefore, we can directly apply the result.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Applying the theorem, the simplicial volume of the product $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is:\n    $$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 0$$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Non-triviality of the Result:** The result that the simplicial volume of the product is zero is highly non-trivial and somewhat counter-intuitive. Both $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$ are \"large\" from the perspective of simplicial volume ($||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 120$, $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 64$), yet their product \"collapses\" to have a simplicial volume of zero.\n*   **The Role of Genera:** The specific genera 31 and 17 are primarily to ensure that the surfaces are hyperbolic (genus $g \\ge 2$), and thus have non-zero simplicial volumes individually. The vanishing result for the product holds for any product of closed surfaces $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$ as long as $g \\ge 1$ and $h \\ge 1$.\n*   **The Product Inequality is not an Equality:** One might be tempted to use the product inequality to estimate the volume. For this case, it gives $||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| \\le \\binom{4}{2} ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 6 \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64 = 46080$. This provides an upper bound, but the actual value is 0, showing that the inequality can be far from sharp.\n*   **Proof Technique:** The proof of the vanishing theorem is advanced, typically relying on the properties of bounded cohomology for product groups or on geometric \"shearing\" arguments that can represent the fundamental class with arbitrarily small $L^1$-norm. A naive application of homological formulas can lead to paradoxes if the subtleties of bounded cohomology are not handled carefully. For solving this problem, however, knowledge and application of the theorem's statement suffice.\n*   **General Applicability:** The theorem is very general. It applies to products of manifolds of any positive dimensions, for instance, $||\\Sigma_g \\times S^n||=0$ for $g\\ge 1, n\\ge 1$.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis and applying the theorem on the simplicial volume of product manifolds, the final answer is computed."
