    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Technology Used:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture beat-to-beat intervals.\n    *   **Measurements:** Both Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) are tracked.\n    *   **Core Question:** HRV is calculated based on a specific \"value between heartbeats.\" We need to identify the name of this value.\n\n2.  **Understanding Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**\n    *   HRV is not a single measurement but a statistical analysis of the *variations* in time between successive heartbeats.\n    *   A high HRV indicates that the time between beats is constantly changing, which is a sign of a healthy, adaptable nervous system. A low HRV means the time between beats is more constant, which can be a sign of stress or poor health.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Core \"Value\":**\n    *   To calculate the *variability*, you first need a series of measurements of the time *between* each beat.\n    *   This fundamental measurement is the duration of the interval from one heartbeat to the next.\n\n4.  **Naming the Value/Interval:**\n    *   The most classical and widely used term for this interval comes from electrocardiography (ECG), the gold standard for measuring the heart's electrical activity. In an ECG waveform, the most prominent peak is the \"R wave.\" The time between two consecutive R waves is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   While PPG doesn't measure R-waves (it measures blood volume changes), the term **R-R interval** is often used colloquially and in many research papers to refer to the beat-to-beat interval, regardless of the measurement technology.\n    *   A more general and technologically neutral term is the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**. This term is perfectly accurate for data from both ECG and PPG.\n    *   Sometimes, after data cleaning (removing abnormal beats called artifacts or ectopic beats), the intervals are referred to as **NN intervals** (Normal-to-Normal intervals).\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Terminology:**\n    *   The \"value\" is a measure of time.\n    *   The most common and historically significant name for this time interval is the **R-R interval**.\n    *   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** is also a correct and widely used term, especially in contexts that include non-ECG sensors like PPG.\n    *   Both terms refer to the same fundamental measurement: the time elapsed between two consecutive heartbeats. Given its prevalence and historical origin, \"R-R interval\" is a primary answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Technology Specificity:** The question mentions PPG. While **R-R interval** comes from ECG, it has become a standard term for the beat-to-beat interval in the field of HRV analysis, even when using PPG. **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** is technically more precise for PPG but **R-R interval** is more widely recognized.\n*   **HRV vs. the Interval:** It's crucial to distinguish between the interval itself (e.g., R-R interval) and the final HRV metric (e.g., SDNN or RMSSD), which is a statistical calculation *based on a series* of those intervals. The question asks for the name of the foundational interval.\n*   **Data Cleaning:** Raw R-R intervals are often filtered to remove abnormalities before HRV is calculated. These filtered intervals are called NN (Normal-to-Normal) intervals. However, the fundamental value being measured is still the R-R interval or IBI.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate and common answer for the \"value between heartbeats\" used to compute HRV is the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
