Based on its role in promoting the survival, proliferation, and memory phenotype of T cells, interleukin-15 would be predicted to **increase** the release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) in CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation. The resulting T cell product is more potent and persistent, leading to a more robust functional response compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
