    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user's question asks for the identification of a specific novel based on two key pieces of information attributed to the writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A descriptive quote about the novel: \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the novel's author: \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: The Quote.** The phrase \"the intensity of a tiger\" suggests a work that is fierce, powerful, primal, and possibly violent in its themes or execution. The second part, \"the variety that a chess duel can achieve,\" points to intellectual complexity, intricate structure, strategic depth, and a high-stakes conflict between opposing forces or ideas. The novel must therefore be both visceral and intelligent.\n    *   **Clue 2: The Author Description.** The author is described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This means the author's work follows in the literary tradition of William Faulkner, a master of Southern Gothic literature known for his complex narratives, stream-of-consciousness style, and exploration of themes like sin, decay, and history in the American South. The word \"simplifier\" is a crucial qualifier, suggesting this author takes Faulkner's themes and general milieu but presents them with more directness, conciseness, or stylistic clarity than Faulkner himself.\n\n2.  **Connect the clues to an author and novel:**\n    *   The description of a \"continuator of Faulkner\" strongly points to another major figure in 20th-century Southern Gothic literature. The most prominent candidate who fits this description is Flannery O'Connor. Her work is deeply rooted in the American South, preoccupied with religion, grace, and violence, and is often compared to Faulkner's. However, O'Connor's prose is known for its sharp, brutal clarity and conciseness, which fits Borges's \"simplifier\" label perfectly.\n    *   Now, we must find where Borges made these comments. The remarks come from a review Borges wrote for the Argentinian magazine *El Hogar* in 1961.\n    *   In that review, Borges was discussing Flannery O'Connor's second novel.\n    *   The novel in question is **_The Violent Bear It Away_**, published in 1960. The plot, which details the intense spiritual and psychological battle within the young protagonist, Francis Marion Tarwater, over his destiny as a prophet, perfectly matches the description of a conflict with both the \"intensity of a tiger\" (the violent, fanatical faith) and the \"variety that a chess duel can achieve\" (the intricate theological and psychological struggle between Tarwater's ingrained beliefs and his rationalist uncle's influence).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the analysis of the descriptive quote and the author's literary lineage, we can confidently identify the novel. Jorge Luis Borges was referring to Flannery O'Connor's novel *The Violent Bear It Away* when he made these remarks in his 1961 review.\n\n<<<The Violent Bear It Away>>>"
