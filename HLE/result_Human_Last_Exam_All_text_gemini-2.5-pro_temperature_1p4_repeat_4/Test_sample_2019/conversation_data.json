    "This problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Define the board and non-attacking conditions:**\n    *   The board is a 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around (a torus). A cell `(r, c)` can be considered as `(r mod 5, c mod 5)`. We can use rows and columns indexed from 0 to 4.\n    *   For queens to be non-attacking, no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.\n    *   On a toroidal board, there are two types of diagonals. For two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`, the non-attacking conditions are:\n        *   `r1 ≠ r2` (different rows)\n        *   `c1 ≠ c2` (different columns)\n        *   `(r1 - c1) mod 5 ≠ (r2 - c2) mod 5` (different main diagonals)\n        *   `(r1 + c1) mod 5 ≠ (r2 + c2) mod 5` (different anti-diagonals)\n\n2.  **Relating (n-1)-Queens to n-Queens on a Torus:**\n    This problem of placing `k = n-1` non-attacking queens on an `n x n` toroidal board is a well-studied problem. There is a direct relationship between the number of solutions for `n-1` queens and the number of solutions for `n` queens.\n\n    *   **Let `P(k)` be the set of solutions for placing `k` non-attacking queens.** We want to find `|P(4)|` for `n=5`.\n    *   **Let `Q(n)` be the set of solutions for placing `n` non-attacking queens.** For a solution in `Q(n)`, all `n` rows, columns, and diagonals are occupied.\n    *   **From `n` queens to `n-1` queens:** If we start with a valid `n`-queen configuration, removing any one of the `n` queens results in a valid `(n-1)`-queen configuration. Since there are `|Q(n)|` solutions for `n` queens, and we can remove any of the `n` queens, this process generates `n * |Q(n)|` configurations for `n-1` queens. These configurations are all distinct.\n\n    *   **From `n-1` queens to `n` queens:** Consider a valid `(n-1)`-queen configuration. There will be exactly one empty row (`r_e`), one empty column (`c_e`), one empty main diagonal (`d_e`), and one empty anti-diagonal (`s_e`). The values of these empty \"coordinates\" are related by the equations:\n        *   `d_e = (r_e - c_e) mod n`\n        *   `s_e = (r_e + c_e) mod n`\n        To extend this `(n-1)`-queen solution to an `n`-queen solution, we must place the `n`-th queen at the intersection of the empty row and column, which is the cell `(r_e, c_e)`. This new queen at `(r_e, c_e)` will lie on the main diagonal `r_e - c_e = d_e` and the anti-diagonal `r_e + c_e = s_e`. Since these were precisely the empty diagonals in the `(n-1)`-queen configuration, the new queen does not attack any of the existing queens. Thus, every `(n-1)`-queen configuration can be uniquely extended to an `n`-queen configuration.\n\n    *   **Conclusion of the relationship:** The two processes described establish a bijection. The number of ways to place `n-1` non-attacking queens on an `n x n` torus is exactly `n` times the number of ways to place `n` non-attacking queens.\n        `|P(n-1)| = n * |Q(n)|`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of 5-queen solutions on a 5x5 torus (`|Q(5)|`):**\n    A solution for 5 queens on a 5x5 torus corresponds to a permutation `p` of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` such that if the queens are placed at `(i, p(i))`, the values of `i - p(i) mod 5` and `i + p(i) mod 5` also form permutations of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\n    For a prime `n >= 5`, the solutions are known to be linear permutations of the form `p(i) = a*i + b mod n`.\n    For this to be a valid solution, `p(i)` must be a permutation, which is true if `gcd(a, n) = 1`.\n    The map `i -> i - p(i) = i - (ai+b) = (1-a)i - b` must also be a permutation, which requires `gcd(1-a, n) = 1`.\n    The map `i -> i + p(i) = i + (ai+b) = (1+a)i + b` must also be a permutation, which requires `gcd(1+a, n) = 1`.\n\n    For `n=5` (a prime number), the conditions are:\n    *   `a` must be in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n    *   `1-a mod 5 ≠ 0` => `a ≠ 1`.\n    *   `1+a mod 5 ≠ 0` => `a ≠ -1 mod 5` => `a ≠ 4`.\n\n    So, the possible values for `a` are `2` and `3`.\n    *   If `a=2`: `p(i) = 2i + b`. The value of `b` can be any of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. This gives 5 distinct solutions.\n    *   If `a=3`: `p(i) = 3i + b`. The value of `b` can be any of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. This gives another 5 distinct solutions.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of 5-queen solutions on a 5x5 torus is `|Q(5)| = 5 + 5 = 10`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    Using the formula from Step 2 with `n=5`:\n    Number of ways = `|P(4)| = 5 * |Q(5)| = 5 * 10 = 50`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{50}$."
