    "**1. Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe given system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nLet's write this as:\n$$d' = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3 + u^4$$\n$$u' = u^3 - u^2$$\nWe are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points occur when $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 1+1 = 2d^2+2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Linearize the system and classify the equilibrium points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u,d)$:\nLet $F(u,d) = u^3 - u^2$ and $G(u,d) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3 + u^4$.\n$$ J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   At $(1,0)$:\n    $$ J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ (-3+10)(0) - 3+4 & 4(0)-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, $(1,0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   At $(1,-1)$:\n    $$ J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ (-3+10)(-1) - 3+4 & 4(-1)-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7-3+4 & -4-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   At $(0,0)$:\n    $$ J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The linearization is inconclusive. This point is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Find the separatrix**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of qualitatively different behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. We found a saddle point at $(1,-1)$.\n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n*   For the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ (unstable direction):\n    $(J - I) \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This gives $-6v_u - 3v_d = 0$, or $v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold at $(1,-1)$ is tangent to the line with slope $-2$.\n\n*   For the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$ (stable direction):\n    $(J - (-2)I) \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This gives $3v_u = 0$, so $v_u = 0$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The stable manifold at $(1,-1)$ is tangent to the vertical line $u=1$.\n\nThe separatrix is often an invariant curve that can be expressed by a simple function. Let's look for a trajectory of the form $d = f(u)$. The unstable manifold of the saddle point is such a trajectory. We will search for a simple function that could represent this manifold. A common technique is to test polynomial functions.\n\nLet's test if a parabola of the form $d = au^2+bu+c$ can be a solution trajectory.\nThis curve must pass through the saddle point $(1, -1)$. So, $d(1) = a+b+c = -1$.\nIt might also connect to another equilibrium point, like $(0,0)$. If it passes through $(0,0)$, then $d(0) = c = 0$.\nSo we have $c=0$ and $a+b = -1$. Let's try the simplest case, where $b=0$, so $a=-1$. This gives the candidate curve $d = -u^2$.\n\nLet's check if $d = -u^2$ is a trajectory of the system.\nIf $d(t) = -[u(t)]^2$, then by the chain rule, $d'(t) = -2u(t)u'(t)$.\nSubstitute $d = -u^2$ and $d' = -2uu'$ into the first differential equation:\n$$ -2uu' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u) $$\nNow, substitute $u' = u^2(u-1) = u^3-u^2$:\n$$ -2u(u^3-u^2) = 2u^4 - 3u^3 + 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4 $$\n$$ -2u^4 + 2u^3 = (2-5+1)u^4 + (-3-1)u^3 \\text{ Error in previous scratchpad calculation, let's re-calculate RHS}$$\nLet's restart the RHS substitution:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3 + u^4$\nSubstitute $d=-u^2$:\nRHS = $2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3 + u^4$\nRHS = $2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\nRHS = $(2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\nRHS = $-2u^4 + 2u^3$\nLHS = $d' = -2uu' = -2u(u^3-u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\nSince LHS = RHS, the equation $d = -u^2$ describes an invariant curve, which is a trajectory of the system.\n\nThis curve passes through $(1, -1)$. Let's check the slope at this point. For $d=-u^2$, $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$. This matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTherefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\nThis trajectory separates the phase plane $u \\ge 0$ into two regions:\n1.  The region above the curve, $d > -u^2$, which contains the unstable node $(1,0)$.\n2.  The region below the curve, $d < -u^2$.\n\nTrajectories cannot cross this curve. Thus, it acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions of distinct long-term behavior.\n\n**2. Careful Points**\n\n*   The equilibrium points must be correctly identified.\n*   The stability analysis via the Jacobian matrix is crucial. Special attention is needed for non-hyperbolic points like $(0,0)$.\n*   A separatrix is a special trajectory. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are the most common examples.\n*   Verifying that a candidate curve is indeed a trajectory involves substituting it back into the original system of differential equations.\n*   Confirming that the tangent of the candidate curve at the saddle point matches the direction of the corresponding eigenvector is a vital check.\n*   The problem is restricted to $u \\ge 0$. The answer should reflect this.\n\n**3. Final Answer**\n\nThe separatrix of the system is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. We have found this to be the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$. This parabola passes through the origin $(0,0)$ and the saddle point $(1,-1)$ and separates the phase plane for $u \\ge 0$ into two invariant regions.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
