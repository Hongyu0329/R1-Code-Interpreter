    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the condition**\n\nLet $N = 100000$. We are given two sequences of real numbers, $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N$ and $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_N$.\nThe sequence $a_i$ can be any sequence with $a_i \\in [0, 1]$.\nThe sequence $x_i$ must satisfy two properties:\n1.  $x_i \\in [-S, S]$ for all $i=0, 1, \\dots, N$, where $S = 1 - 10^{-M}$.\n2.  $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ for all $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$.\n\nThe second condition means that $x_i = x_{i-1} \\pm a_i$. We can write this as $x_i = x_{i-1} + \\epsilon_i a_i$ for some choice of signs $\\epsilon_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\nBy repeatedly applying this relation, we can express any $x_k$ in terms of the starting value $x_0$:\n$x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$.\nLet's define the partial sums $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i a_i$ for $k \\ge 1$, and $S_0 = 0$. Then $x_k = x_0 + S_k$.\n\nThe condition is that for any sequence $(a_i)_{i=1}^N$ with $a_i \\in [0,1]$, there must exist a starting value $x_0$ and a sequence of signs $(\\epsilon_i)_{i=1}^N$ such that all the resulting $x_k$ values lie in the interval $[-S, S]$.\nThis means we require $x_k \\in [-S, S]$ for all $k=0, 1, \\dots, N$.\nSo, we must have $-S \\le x_0 + S_k \\le S$ for all $k=0, \\dots, N$.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the condition on the range of partial sums**\n\nThe condition $-S \\le x_0 + S_k \\le S$ can be rewritten as an interval for $x_0$:\n$-S - S_k \\le x_0 \\le S - S_k$.\nThis must hold for all $k=0, \\dots, N$. For such an $x_0$ to exist, the intersection of all these intervals for $x_0$ must be non-empty. This means the lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound:\n$\\max_{k} (-S - S_k) \\le \\min_{j} (S - S_j)$.\nLet's simplify this inequality:\n$-S + \\max_{k} (-S_k) \\le S + \\min_{j} (-S_j)$.\nUsing the properties $\\max(-A) = -\\min(A)$ and $\\min(-A) = -\\max(A)$:\n$-S - \\min_{k} S_k \\le S - \\max_{j} S_j$.\nRearranging the terms gives:\n$\\max_{j} S_j - \\min_{k} S_k \\le 2S$.\n\nLet $R(\\{\\epsilon_i\\}) = \\max_{k=0,\\dots,N} S_k - \\min_{k=0,\\dots,N} S_k$ be the range of the partial sums for a particular choice of signs $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$.\nThe problem states that for any sequence $a_i$, there exists a sequence $x_i$. This means for any $a_i$, we can find a sequence of signs $\\epsilon_i$ and a value $x_0$ that satisfy the conditions.\nFor a given sequence $a_i$, we are free to choose the signs $\\epsilon_i$ to make the range as small as possible. Let this minimum possible range be $R(a_1, \\dots, a_N) = \\min_{\\{\\epsilon_i\\}} R(\\{\\epsilon_i\\})$.\nThe condition for the existence of the sequence $x_i$ is that this minimal range must be less than or equal to $2S$:\n$R(a_1, \\dots, a_N) \\le 2S$.\n\nThis must hold for ANY sequence $a_i \\in [0,1]$. Therefore, $S$ must be large enough to accommodate the worst-case sequence of $a_i$. Let $R_{max}$ be the supremum of these minimal ranges over all possible sequences $a_i$:\n$R_{max} = \\sup_{a_1, \\dots, a_N \\in [0,1]} R(a_1, \\dots, a_N)$.\n\nThe condition on $M$ becomes $R_{max} \\le 2S = 2(1 - 10^{-M})$.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the maximum minimal range, $R_{max}$**\n\nThis step requires a result from discrepancy theory. A theorem, which can be proved by an elegant inductive argument, states that for any sequence of real numbers $a_1, \\dots, a_N$, there exists a choice of signs $\\epsilon_1, \\dots, \\epsilon_N$ such that the range of the partial sums is no larger than the maximum absolute value of the numbers in the sequence.\nSpecifically, $\\min_{\\{\\epsilon_i\\}} \\left(\\max_{k} S_k - \\min_{k} S_k\\right) \\le \\max_{i} |a_i|$.\n\nIn our problem, $a_i \\in [0,1]$, so $|a_i| = a_i$. Let $A = \\max_{1\\le i\\le N} a_i$. The theorem states that for any sequence $a_i$, we can choose the signs $\\epsilon_i$ such that the range of partial sums is at most $A$.\n$R(a_1, \\dots, a_N) \\le A = \\max_{i} a_i$.\n\nSince $a_i \\in [0,1]$, we have $A \\le 1$. Therefore, for any sequence $a_i$, the minimum possible range is at most 1.\nThis implies that the supremum of these ranges, $R_{max}$, is at most 1.\n$R_{max} = \\sup_{a_i \\in [0,1]} R(a_1, \\dots, a_N) \\le 1$.\n\nTo show that $R_{max}$ is exactly 1, we need to show that there is a sequence $a_i$ for which the minimum range is equal to 1.\nConsider the sequence where $a_i = 1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$.\nThe partial sums are $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\epsilon_i$.\nLet's try to minimize the range for this sequence.\nIf we choose alternating signs, e.g., $\\epsilon_i = (-1)^{i+1}$, the partial sums will be:\n$S_0=0, S_1=1, S_2=1-1=0, S_3=0+1=1, S_4=1-1=0, \\dots$.\nThe set of values taken by the partial sums is $\\{0, 1\\}$. The range is $1-0=1$.\nAny other choice of signs will result in a range of at least 1. For example, if we ever have two consecutive identical signs, say $\\epsilon_k=\\epsilon_{k+1}=1$ when $S_{k-1}=0$, we would have $S_k=1, S_{k+1}=2$, making the range at least 2. Therefore, the optimal strategy leads to a range of 1.\nSo, for $a_i=1$, we have $R(1, \\dots, 1) = 1$.\n\nThis shows that $R_{max} = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the smallest integer M**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $R_{max}$ back into the inequality.\n$1 \\le 2(1 - 10^{-M})$.\nDivide by 2:\n$0.5 \\le 1 - 10^{-M}$.\nRearrange the terms:\n$10^{-M} \\le 1 - 0.5$.\n$10^{-M} \\le 0.5$.\nTake the base-10 logarithm of both sides. Since $\\log_{10}(x)$ is an increasing function:\n$\\log_{10}(10^{-M}) \\le \\log_{10}(0.5)$.\n$-M \\le \\log_{10}(1/2)$.\n$-M \\le -\\log_{10}(2)$.\nMultiply by -1 and reverse the inequality sign:\n$M \\ge \\log_{10}(2)$.\n\nWe know that $10^0 = 1$ and $10^1 = 10$. Since $1 < 2 < 10$, we have $0 < \\log_{10}(2) < 1$.\nThe approximate value is $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.30103$.\nSo we need $M \\ge 0.30103$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest positive integer $M$ that satisfies this condition. The smallest positive integer greater than or equal to 0.30103 is 1.\n\nThus, $M=1$."
