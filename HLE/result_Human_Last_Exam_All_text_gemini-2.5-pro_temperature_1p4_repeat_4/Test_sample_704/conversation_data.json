    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the musical note.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the first colour in the range:** The question specifies \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In the context of Newton's colour circle, which is based on the spectrum of light, the colour that lies spectrally between yellow and blue is **Green**.\n\n2.  **Identify the second colour in the range:** The question explicitly states the second colour is **Blue**.\n\n3.  **Define the range:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the range between Green and Blue.\n\n4.  **Recall Newton's Colour-Music Correlation:** Sir Isaac Newton, in his book *Opticks*, proposed a connection between the seven colours of the visible spectrum and the seven notes of a musical scale. He arranged the colours in a circle (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) and assigned them to notes.\n\n5.  **Determine the specific mapping:** Newton based his system on the Dorian musical mode. He assigned the root note, **D**, to the colour **Red**. The scale then proceeds as follows:\n    *   Red = **D** (Ut/Do)\n    *   Orange = **E** (Re)\n    *   Yellow = **F** (Mi)\n    *   **Green = G (Fa)**\n    *   **Blue = A (Sol)**\n    *   Indigo = B (La)\n    *   Violet = C (Si/Ti)\n\n6.  **Find the corresponding note:** The question asks for the musical note that corresponds to the range beginning with Green and ending at Blue. In Newton's system, the colour segment for **Green** is mapped to the musical note **G**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Combining Colours\":** It is crucial to understand that \"combining\" here does not refer to pigment mixing but to the colour's position on Newton's spectral circle, which is Green, located between Yellow and Blue.\n*   **Newton's Specific Scale:** The answer relies on Newton's specific assignment of colours to the notes of a Dorian scale starting on D. Using a different scale (like a standard C major) would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Interpreting \"Range\":** The question asks for the \"note corresponds to the range\". Since Newton assigned single notes to colour bands rather than to the boundaries between them, the most logical interpretation is the note corresponding to the first colour in the specified range, which is Green.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the colour between yellow and blue on Newton's circle is Green. According to his specific mapping of colours to musical notes, Green corresponds to the note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
