    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* who expresses a particular sentiment. The sentiment is being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This requires knowledge of the film's characters and their specific dialogues.\n\n2.  **List Careful Points:**\n    *   **Source Material:** The question specifically refers to the 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky, not Stanis≈Çaw Lem's original novel or the 2002 American remake. The dialogue and character portrayals can differ significantly between these versions.\n    *   **Character Motivations:** Understanding the personality of each main character is crucial.\n        *   **Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. He is defined by his strong emotional ties to Earth, his past, and his late wife. His nostalgia for Earth is a central theme, but it is presented more as a source of torment and longing than shame.\n        *   **Hari:** Kris's \"guest,\" a replica of his wife. She has no actual memories of Earth and therefore cannot miss it in the same way a human would. Her journey is about understanding her own artificial existence.\n        *   **Snaut:** One of the scientists already on the station. He is cynical, weary, and often drunk, but also highly intelligent and philosophical. He has been in space for a long time and feels deeply alienated from Earth and humanity.\n        *   **Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist. He is cold, rational, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of their situation. He views emotions and nostalgia as weaknesses that interfere with his work.\n        *   **Gibarian:** He committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a pre-recorded video, where he is in a state of despair and fear.\n    *   **The specific emotion \"ashamed\":** This is a key word. The character doesn't just miss the sound; they feel *shame* about this feeling. This suggests an internal conflict, perhaps a feeling that such nostalgia is a weakness or a sign that they have failed in their mission to become \"men of the cosmos\" and are still bound by simple, terrestrial things.\n\n3.  **Acquire the Final Answer with Analysis:**\n    *   Let's evaluate each character against the specific quote.\n    *   **Sartorius** would be unlikely to feel shame about such a thing; he would more likely suppress or dismiss the feeling as irrelevant data.\n    *   **Kris** is overtly and deeply nostalgic. The entire film is framed by his connection to his home on Earth. He is not ashamed of this connection; it is a fundamental part of who he is.\n    *   **Hari** cannot miss what she has never known.\n    *   This leaves **Snaut**. His character is marked by a deep-seated weariness and a sense of having lost his humanity in the sterile environment of space. He engages in long philosophical discussions with Kris about the purpose of their mission and the nature of man. In one such conversation, he bemoans how they have forgotten what it means to be human and disconnected from Earth. He confesses that he is \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves,\" articulating the feeling that in their grand pursuit of cosmic knowledge, they have become so alienated that a basic human longing feels like a secret, shameful weakness. This line perfectly encapsulates his character's internal conflict and philosophical resignation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe character who speaks this line is Dr. Snaut. He says it to Kris Kelvin, expressing his profound sense of alienation from Earth and his feeling that their scientific hubris has cost them their very humanity, making a simple, natural longing feel like a shameful secret.\n\n<<<C>>>"
