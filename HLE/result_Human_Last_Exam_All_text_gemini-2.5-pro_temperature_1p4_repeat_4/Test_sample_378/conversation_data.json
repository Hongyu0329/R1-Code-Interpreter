    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for the specific year when the former Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\". The question implies that his name is \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" and that at some point, he began using the \"Azikiwe\" part of the name.\n\n2.  **Verify the Subject's Name:** The first step is to confirm the full, official name of the individual in question. Public records, official biographies, and reputable news sources all confirm his full name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is a very famous name in Nigeria, primarily associated with **Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria. It is not part of Goodluck Jonathan's birth name or his officially recognized name.\n\n4.  **Search for Evidence of Name Change or Public Identification:** The next logical step is to search for any public records, news reports, official statements, or interviews where Goodluck Jonathan might have adopted, added, or identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\". A thorough search of news archives and official records from his time as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President, and President reveals no such event.\n\n5.  **Address the False Premise:** The question is based on a false premiseâ€”that \"Azikiwe\" is part of Goodluck Jonathan's name or that he ever adopted it. Since the event never occurred, it is impossible to provide a year for it.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** It is critical to verify the full and correct names of public figures, as inaccuracies can lead to incorrect assumptions. Goodluck Jonathan's middle name is Ebele, not Azikiwe.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The conclusion is based on the absence of credible evidence. No reputable source documents the event described in the question.\n*   **Potential for Misinformation:** The question may stem from misinformation or a conflation of two different prominent Nigerian presidents (Jonathan and Azikiwe).\n*   **Directly Answering the Flaw:** Instead of trying to find a non-existent date, the correct approach is to identify and state that the event in the question never happened.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBased on all available evidence, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" nor has \"Azikiwe\" ever been a part of his official name. Therefore, there is no year in which this event took place.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe.>>>"
