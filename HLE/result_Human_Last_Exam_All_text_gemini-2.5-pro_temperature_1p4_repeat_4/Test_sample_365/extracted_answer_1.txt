The product is the tetracyclic ether formed via intramolecular addition of the C2-alkoxide onto the C6 position of the norbornene double bond, followed by protonation of the resulting C5-carbanion. The structure retains all original substituents, with a new oxetane ring fused to the bicyclic framework.
