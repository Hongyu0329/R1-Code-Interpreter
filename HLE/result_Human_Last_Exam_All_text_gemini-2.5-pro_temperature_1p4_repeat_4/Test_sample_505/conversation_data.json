    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Basics of Surface Codes**\n\n*   **Surface Code Patch:** A surface code is typically implemented on a 2D grid of physical qubits. A \"patch\" refers to a finite, usually rectangular, area of this grid. A patch has outer boundaries.\n*   **Encoding Logical Qubits:** Logical qubits are encoded in the non-local (topological) properties of the patch. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology.\n*   **Boundaries and Holes:** The topology can be modified by creating different types of outer boundaries or by introducing \"holes\" (also known as defects or punctures) inside the patch.\n\n**2. Determine the Number of Logical Qubits in a Single Patch**\n\n*   **A simple patch without holes:** A standard rectangular patch of surface code with appropriate boundary conditions (e.g., \"rough\" and \"smooth\" boundaries) can encode **one logical qubit**. The logical operators are defined as strings of Pauli operators stretching from one boundary to the opposite one.\n*   **The effect of adding holes:** Each hole created within the patch introduces a new, independent way to encode a logical qubit. A hole effectively adds a new internal boundary. For each hole, one can define a pair of non-commuting logical operators (e.g., a Z-operator that loops around the hole and an X-operator that connects the hole to an outer boundary).\n*   **Formula for a single patch:** Based on the above, the number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a single patch with `h` holes is given by:\n    `k = 1 + h`\n    (1 for the base patch + 1 for each hole)\n\n**3. Analyze the System Described in the Question**\n\n*   The question specifies a system composed of **two separate patches** of surface code.\n*   There is a total of **two holes** to be distributed across these two patches.\n*   Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits in each patch.\n    `k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2`\n\n**4. Explore Possible Configurations to Find the Maximum**\n\nLet `h1` be the number of holes in the first patch and `h2` be the number of holes in the second patch. We know that `h1 + h2 = 2`. Let's analyze the possible distributions of these two holes.\n\n*   **Configuration A: Both holes in one patch.**\n    *   Patch 1 has 2 holes (`h1 = 2`).\n    *   Patch 2 has 0 holes (`h2 = 0`).\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1: `k_patch1 = 1 + h1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2: `k_patch2 = 1 + h2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.\n    *   Total logical qubits: `k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n*   **Configuration B: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   Patch 1 has 1 hole (`h1 = 1`).\n    *   Patch 2 has 1 hole (`h2 = 1`).\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1: `k_patch1 = 1 + h1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2: `k_patch2 = 1 + h2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Total logical qubits: `k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBoth possible distributions of the two holes result in the same total number of logical qubits. The calculation can be generalized as follows:\n`k_total = k_patch1 + k_patch2`\n`k_total = (1 + h1) + (1 + h2)`\n`k_total = 2 + (h1 + h2)`\nSince we are given that `h1 + h2 = 2`:\n`k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Patch vs. Torus:** A \"patch\" implies a planar code with boundaries, which is different from a toric code (a surface without boundaries). A simple patch without holes already encodes one logical qubit.\n2.  **Role of Holes:** Each hole adds exactly one logical qubit to the patch it is in.\n3.  **Independence of Patches:** The two patches are separate systems. Their capacities for encoding logical qubits are additive.\n4.  **Maximization:** In this specific problem, all possible distributions of the given resources (two holes) yield the same total number of logical qubits, so the maximum is equal to this value.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$.\n<<<4>>>"
