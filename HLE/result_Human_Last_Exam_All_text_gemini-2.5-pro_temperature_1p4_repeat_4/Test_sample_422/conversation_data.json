    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Core Theory:** The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is **T**rue.\n    2.  S **B**elieves P.\n    3.  S's belief in P is **J**ustified.\n*   **Key Constraint 1:** Our only available epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This creates a simplified, binary system for how we can relate to a proposition. There are no other states like \"supposition,\" \"doubt,\" or \"justification\" itself as a standalone state.\n*   **Key Constraint 2:** We must \"Ignore Gettier problems\". Gettier problems are counterexamples where a person has a justified true belief, but we would intuitively say they don't have knowledge because the justification is flawed or relies on luck. By ignoring these, we must look for problems inherent in the JTB structure itself, not problems of epistemic luck.\n*   **Goal:** Identify two distinct problems that the JTB theory encounters under these specific constraints.\n\n**2. Identifying Problem 1: The Regress of Justification**\n\n*   **The Role of 'J' (Justification):** The JTB definition fundamentally relies on the concept of \"justification.\" Without it, any true belief (even a lucky guess) would be knowledge.\n*   **The Constraint's Impact:** The prompt states our only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief. So, what is the nature of the justification itself? It must be grounded in either more beliefs or in knowledge.\n*   **Scenario A: Justification is based on Belief.** If our justification for believing P is another belief, Q, then the question arises: what justifies our belief in Q? This requires another belief, R, and so on. This creates an infinite regress where no belief is ever ultimately justified. For example, I know the sky is blue because a scientist told me. I believe the scientist because I believe they are an expert. I believe they are an expert because I believe their credentials are valid, etc. The chain of \"beliefs justifying beliefs\" can go on forever without a solid foundation.\n*   **Scenario B: Justification is based on Knowledge.** If our justification for believing P must be *knowledge* of another proposition Q, then the JTB definition becomes circular. It would read: \"To have Knowledge of P, you must have a True Belief in P that is justified by your Knowledge of Q.\" This defines knowledge in terms of itself, which is logically unhelpful and fails to provide a foundational definition.\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 1:** Within a system limited to only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" the \"Justification\" component of JTB cannot be grounded. It either leads to an **infinite regress** (if based on other beliefs) or becomes **circular** (if based on other knowledge).\n\n**3. Identifying Problem 2: The Necessity of the Belief Condition**\n\n*   **The Role of 'B' (Belief):** JTB asserts that belief is a necessary condition for knowledge. You cannot know something you do not believe.\n*   **Challenging the Necessity:** Can a person know something without the corresponding psychological state of \"belief\"? Philosophers argue yes.\n*   **The Classic Example (The Insecure Student):** Imagine a student who studied hard for a history exam but is extremely nervous and has no confidence. When asked for a specific date, they state the correct answer but say, \"I'm not sure, I feel like I'm just guessing.\" From an external perspective, they clearly demonstrated knowledgeâ€”they provided the correct information they had learned. However, they lack the internal feeling or conviction of \"belief.\"\n*   **The Constraint's Impact:** The JTB model is forced to deny that the student has knowledge because the \"Belief\" condition (B) is not met from the student's own perspective. In a strict system with only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" as possible states, the JTB definition appears too rigid. It excludes cases where an individual can reliably produce true, justified information but lacks the specific psychological conviction we call belief.\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 2:** The JTB requirement that knowledge must include belief is problematic. It may be too strong, as it excludes potential instances of **knowledge without belief**, forcing us to deny that people like the insecure student possess knowledge.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are two main problems the JTB theory runs into under the given constraints, independent of Gettier cases.\n\n1.  **The Regress of Justification:** The JTB definition requires justification, but the provided epistemic states are only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief.\" This creates a dilemma for what can count as a justification. If a justification is simply another \"Belief,\" then that belief also requires justification, leading to an infinite regress with no foundational support. If, alternatively, a justification must be \"Knowledge,\" then the definition becomes circular, as it uses the concept of knowledge to define knowledge itself.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Knowledge Without Belief:** The JTB definition insists that Belief is a necessary condition for Knowledge. However, there are plausible scenarios where an individual seems to possess knowledge without consciously holding the corresponding belief. The classic example is an insecure student who answers a question correctly but claims they were just guessing. They have access to the true, justified information, yet they lack the psychological state of belief. JTB would be forced to conclude they do not have knowledge, which seems counter-intuitive.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems are:\n1. The Regress of Justification: The \"Justification\" component cannot be grounded within a system limited to only Knowledge and Belief without leading to either an infinite regress (if justifications are beliefs) or circularity (if justifications require knowledge).\n2. The Necessity of the Belief Condition: The requirement that knowledge must include belief is too strong, as it incorrectly excludes cases where an individual possesses knowledge but lacks the corresponding psychological state of belief (e.g., an insecure student who answers correctly but thinks they are guessing).\n>>>"
