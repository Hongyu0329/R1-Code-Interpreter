The two problems are:
1. The Regress of Justification: The "Justification" component cannot be grounded within a system limited to only Knowledge and Belief without leading to either an infinite regress (if justifications are beliefs) or circularity (if justifications require knowledge).
2. The Necessity of the Belief Condition: The requirement that knowledge must include belief is too strong, as it incorrectly excludes cases where an individual possesses knowledge but lacks the corresponding psychological state of belief (e.g., an insecure student who answers correctly but thinks they are guessing).
