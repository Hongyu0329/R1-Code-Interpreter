    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structures of the reactants.**\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde with the IUPAC name 2,2-dimethylpropanal. The carbonyl group (-CHO) is attached to a tert-butyl group (-(CH₃)₃C). Its structure is:\n    ```\n       O\n      //\n    (CH₃)₃C-C-H\n    ```\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane:** This is a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. Let's parse the name to determine its structure:\n    *   \"triphenyl-l5-phosphane\" indicates a triphenylphosphine group, PPh₃.\n    *   The \"l5-phosphane\" notation indicates a phosphorus ylide, where phosphorus has a formal charge of +1 and the adjacent carbon has a formal charge of -1, often represented by a P=C double bond.\n    *   \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\" describes the carbon chain attached to the phosphorus. \"Ethylidene\" refers to a two-carbon group `(=CH-CH₂-)`.\n    *   The substituent \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" means a 2-chlorophenyl group is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene chain.\n    *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is:\n        ```\n        Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n        ```\n        where the chloro group is at the 2-position of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism and its Key Transformation.**\n\n*   The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes from carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones) and phosphorus ylides.\n*   The core transformation involves the replacement of the C=O double bond of the carbonyl compound with the C=P double bond of the ylide, forming a new C=C double bond.\n*   The oxygen from the carbonyl group and the PPh₃ from the ylide combine to form a very stable byproduct, triphenylphosphine oxide (O=PPh₃).\n*   The connection happens between the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde and the ylide carbon (the one bonded to phosphorus).\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Connectivity of the Product.**\n\n*   The aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) contributes the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part of the new alkene.\n*   The ylide contributes the `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` part.\n*   Connecting these two fragments results in the following product structure:\n    ```\n    (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product (E/Z Isomerism).**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The stereochemical outcome of the Wittig reaction is a crucial aspect and depends on the stability of the ylide.\n*   **Classifying the Ylide:** The ylide `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` has an alkyl-type group (`-CH₂-Ar`) attached to the negatively charged carbon. There are no electron-withdrawing groups like esters, ketones, or nitriles to stabilize the carbanion through resonance. Therefore, this is classified as an **unstabilized ylide**.\n*   **Stereoselectivity Rule:** Unstabilized ylides react under kinetic control and strongly favor the formation of the **Z-alkene** (or cis-alkene). The reaction proceeds through a less sterically hindered, puckered transition state that leads to a cis-oxaphosphetane intermediate, which then decomposes to the Z-alkene.\n*   **Applying the Rule:** The major product of this reaction will be the Z-isomer. In the Z-isomer, the two higher-priority groups attached to the carbons of the double bond are on the same side.\n    *   On the left carbon: `-C(CH₃)₃` (high priority) vs. `-H` (low priority).\n    *   On the right carbon: `-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` (high priority) vs. `-H` (low priority).\n    *   Therefore, the bulky tert-butyl group and the 2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl group will be on the same side of the double bond.\n\n**Step 5: Name the Final Product.**\n\n1.  **Find the parent chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a five-carbon chain (pentene).\n    `(2-chlorophenyl)-CH₂(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-C(4)(CH₃)₂-CH₃`\n2.  **Number the chain:** Numbering from the phenyl-substituted end gives the double bond the lowest possible number (position 2). So it is a **pent-2-ene**.\n3.  **Identify and name substituents:**\n    *   At position 1: a `(2-chlorophenyl)` group.\n    *   At position 4: two `methyl` groups (4,4-dimethyl).\n4.  **Assemble the full name:** Add the stereochemical descriptor (Z) to the beginning of the name.\n\nThe final name of the major product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
