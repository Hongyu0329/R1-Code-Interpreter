    "An n-step self-avoiding walk on a lattice is a path of n steps on the lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The lattice in question is the Manhattan lattice, also known as the square lattice, where each point (x, y) with integer coordinates has four neighbors: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1).\n\nLet a(n) be the number of n-step self-avoiding walks starting from the origin.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **n = 0:** The walk consists of a single point, the origin. There is only one such walk (the walk of zero length). So, `a(0) = 1`.\n\n2.  **n = 1:** From the origin (0,0), we can take one step to any of its four neighbors: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All these walks are trivially self-avoiding.\n    So, `a(1) = 4`.\n\n3.  **n = 2:** We start with a 1-step walk. There are 4 choices for the first step. For each choice, let's say we moved to (1,0), the second step can be to any neighbor of (1,0) except the origin (0,0), to avoid immediate backtracking and keep the walk self-avoiding. The neighbors of (1,0) are (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), and (1,-1). Excluding (0,0), we have 3 choices for the second step. Since there were 4 initial choices, the total number of 2-step walks is 4 * 3 = 12.\n    So, `a(2) = 12`.\n\n4.  **n = 3:** We extend the 12 walks of length 2. Let's take a 2-step walk, for example, (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). The endpoint is (2,0). Its neighbors are (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). To be self-avoiding, the next step cannot be to (1,0) (backtracking). The other potential vertices (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1) have not been visited. So there are 3 choices.\n    Let's take another example, (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1). The endpoint is (1,1). Its neighbors are (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). The next step cannot be (1,0). The other vertices (2,1), (1,2), (0,1) have not been visited. So there are again 3 choices.\n    For any 2-step SAW, the third step has 3 valid choices (the next point cannot be the starting point of the walk).\n    So, `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`.\n\n5.  **n = 4:** This is where it gets complicated. We start from the 36 walks of length 3. The number of choices for the 4th step is not always 3. It depends on the shape of the 3-step walk.\n    *   **Case 1:** The walk forms a nearly closed loop. For example, the walk (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1). The endpoint is (0,1). Its neighbors are (1,1), (0,0), (-1,1), (0,2). The walk cannot backtrack to (1,1). Also, the walk cannot revisit the origin (0,0). So, there are only 2 valid choices for the next step: (-1,1) or (0,2).\n    *   **Case 2:** The walk is \"stretched out\". For example, (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0). The endpoint is (3,0). Its neighbors are (2,0), (4,0), (3,1), (3,-1). The walk cannot backtrack to (2,0). The other points have not been visited. So there are 3 valid choices.\n\n    To calculate a(4), we need to count how many of the 36 walks of length 3 fall into Case 1. These are the walks whose endpoint is a neighbor of the starting point. There are 8 such walks (e.g., (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1)).\n    *   The 8 walks of Case 1 have 2 valid extensions each: 8 * 2 = 16.\n    *   The remaining 36 - 8 = 28 walks of Case 2 have 3 valid extensions each: 28 * 3 = 84.\n    *   So, `a(4) = 16 + 84 = 100`.\n\n**Higher values of n:**\n\nCalculating a(n) for larger n by hand is extremely tedious and prone to error. There is no known simple closed-form formula for a(n). The sequence is typically computed using sophisticated computer algorithms. This is a well-known sequence in combinatorics and statistical physics.\n\nThe sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice begins:\na(0) = 1\na(1) = 4\na(2) = 12\na(3) = 36\na(4) = 100\na(5) = 284\na(6) = 780\na(7) = 2,172\na(8) = 5,916\na(9) = 16,268\na(10) = 44,100\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411. The question asks for the value of a(10). Based on the established values for this sequence, a(10) is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
