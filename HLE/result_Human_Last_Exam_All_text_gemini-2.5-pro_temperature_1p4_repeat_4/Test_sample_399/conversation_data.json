    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation:**\nThe given differential equation is $x'(t)=(t-1)\\cdot x^2(t)$, which can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. This is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We can see that it is separable because the right-hand side is a product of a function of $t$ and a function of $x$.\n\n**2. Separate the variables:**\nTo solve this equation, we move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\nAssuming $x(t) \\neq 0$ (which is true for our initial condition $x(0)=-8$), we can divide both sides by $x^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} \\frac{dx}{dt} = t-1\n$$\nNow, we can write it in differential form for integration:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n**3. Integrate both sides:**\nWe integrate the left side with respect to $x$ and the right side with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2} = x^{-2}$ is $\\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\nThe integral of $(t-1)$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\nSo, after integration, we have:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 - t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C:**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our integrated equation to solve for $C$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\nC = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**5. Write down the particular solution:**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1):**\nThe final goal is to find the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2}(1)^2 - (1) + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo simplify the right-hand side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to find $x(1)$:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
