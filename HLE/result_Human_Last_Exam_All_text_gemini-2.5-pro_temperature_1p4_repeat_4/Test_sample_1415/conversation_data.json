    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Functions:** The problem defines a sequence of functions, where each function is built upon the previous one.\n    *   `F₀(x) = x`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n2.  **Analyze the Integrand:** The core of the problem is to evaluate the definite integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`.\n    *   The expression `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is a specific form. If we let `u = F₃(x)`, then the derivative of `u` with respect to `x` is `du/dx = F₃'(x)`. The integrand can be written as `(1/u) * du/dx`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Integration Method:** The integral is of the form `∫ (u'/u) dx`.\n    *   The antiderivative of `u'/u` with respect to `x` is `ln|u| + C`.\n    *   Therefore, `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)| + C`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The question asks for a definite integral from `x = 0` to `x = 1`.\n    *   The value of the integral, let's call it `V`, is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1.\n    *   `V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Function at the Limits:**\n    *   At `x = 0`: `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`.\n    *   At `x = 1`: `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Value of the Integral (V):**\n    *   Substitute the values back: `V = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|`.\n    *   We must check if the arguments of the absolute values are positive.\n        *   `ln(2) ≈ 0.693 > 0`.\n        *   For `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`: `1` radian is in the first quadrant, so `sin(1)` is positive. `e^(sin(1))` is greater than `e^0 = 1`. Thus, `1 + e^(sin(1))` is greater than 2. The logarithm of a number greater than 2 is positive.\n    *   Since both terms are positive, we can remove the absolute value signs: `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, this can be simplified to `V = ln[ ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) ]`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The final step is to compute the numerical value of `V`, multiply it by `10000`, and find the closest integer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Integral Form Recognition:** The most crucial step is to recognize that the integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`. This simplifies the problem immensely, avoiding the complex task of explicitly computing `F₃'(x)` and then trying to integrate the resulting expression.\n2.  **Radians, not Degrees:** The term `sin(1)` refers to the sine of 1 radian, not 1 degree. Ensure your calculator is in radian mode for the numerical calculation.\n3.  **Numerical Precision:** To get an accurate final answer, it's important to maintain high precision during intermediate calculations. Rounding values like `sin(1)` or `ln(2)` too early can lead to significant errors in the final result. It's best to compute the entire expression for `V` in a calculator before the final rounding step.\n4.  **Logarithm Properties:** Correctly applying logarithm rules (`ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`) can simplify the final calculation but is not strictly necessary if high precision is maintained.\n5.  **Final Rounding:** The question asks for the *closest integer* to `10000 * V`. This means rounding to the nearest whole number (e.g., 5488.3 rounds to 5488, while 5488.7 rounds to 5489).\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Set up the definite integral.**\nAs determined above, the value of the integral `V` is:\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)`.**\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 3: Substitute these into the expression for V.**\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\n**Step 4: Perform the numerical calculation for V.**\nUsing a calculator for high precision:\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.31976856`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.31976856`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(3.31976856) ≈ 1.2000003`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718`\n\nNow, calculate `V`:\n`V ≈ ln(1.2000003) - ln(0.69314718)`\n`V ≈ 0.18232182 - (-0.36651292)`\n`V ≈ 0.54883474`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate `10000 * V` and find the closest integer.**\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54883474`\n`10000 * V ≈ 5488.3474`\n\nThe closest integer to `5488.3474` is `5488`.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
