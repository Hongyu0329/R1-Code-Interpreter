    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the polynomial**\n\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nLet's analyze the part of the polynomial without the constant term: $g(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$. This polynomial has a special structure related to De Moivre's formula or Chebyshev polynomials.\n\nConsider the substitution $x = y + a/y$ for some constant $a$. Using the binomial expansion, one can derive recurrence relations for $y^n + (a/y)^n$. Let $P_n(x, a) = y^n + (a/y)^n$.\nThe recurrence relation is $P_n(x, a) = x P_{n-1}(x, a) - a P_{n-2}(x, a)$.\nLet's choose $a=2$ and compute $P_7(x, 2)$.\n$P_0(x, 2) = y^0 + (2/y)^0 = 2$.\n$P_1(x, 2) = y + 2/y = x$.\n$P_2(x, 2) = x P_1 - 2 P_0 = x^2 - 4$.\n$P_3(x, 2) = x P_2 - 2 P_1 = x(x^2 - 4) - 2x = x^3 - 6x$.\n$P_4(x, 2) = x P_3 - 2 P_2 = x(x^3 - 6x) - 2(x^2 - 4) = x^4 - 8x^2 + 8$.\n$P_5(x, 2) = x P_4 - 2 P_3 = x(x^4 - 8x^2 + 8) - 2(x^3 - 6x) = x^5 - 10x^3 + 20x$.\n$P_6(x, 2) = x P_5 - 2 P_4 = x(x^5 - 10x^3 + 20x) - 2(x^4 - 8x^2 + 8) = x^6 - 12x^4 + 36x^2 - 16$.\n$P_7(x, 2) = x P_6 - 2 P_5 = x(x^6 - 12x^4 + 36x^2 - 16) - 2(x^5 - 10x^3 + 20x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\n\nThis exactly matches $f(x) - 22$. So, the equation $f(x)=0$ can be written as $P_7(x, 2) = -22$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the roots of the polynomial**\n\nFrom the definition of $P_7(x,2)$, the equation $f(x)=0$ is equivalent to $y^7 + (2/y)^7 = -22$, where the roots of $f(x)$ are given by $x = y + 2/y$.\nLet $z = y^7$. The equation becomes $z + 128/z = -22$.\nMultiplying by $z$ gives a quadratic equation: $z^2 + 22z + 128 = 0$.\nThe solutions for $z$ are:\n$z = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{22^2 - 4(1)(128)}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 512}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{-28}}{2} = -11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$.\nSo, $y^7 = -11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$. Let's choose the solution with the plus sign, $\\alpha = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$. Let $\\nu$ be any 7th root of $\\alpha$, so $\\nu^7 = \\alpha$.\nThe seven values for $y$ are then $\\nu, \\nu\\zeta_7, \\nu\\zeta_7^2, \\dots, \\nu\\zeta_7^6$, where $\\zeta_7 = e^{2\\pi i/7}$ is a primitive 7th root of unity.\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are given by $x_k = \\nu\\zeta_7^k + 2/(\\nu\\zeta_7^k)$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 6$.\nThese 7 roots are distinct.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the polynomial**\n\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the field $L = \\mathbb{Q}(x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_6)$. From the form of the roots, we see that $L$ is contained in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\nu, \\zeta_7)$. With a more detailed analysis (which is standard for this type of polynomial), it can be shown that the splitting field is precisely $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\nu, \\zeta_7)$.\n\nThe structure of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is determined by the extensions involved.\nFirst, we have the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$. The minimal polynomial is $\\Phi_7(x)$, and $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7):\\mathbb{Q}]=6$.\nNote that the discriminant of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ is $-7^5$, so $\\sqrt{-7} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$. This means $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{7}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$.\nOur number $\\alpha = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{7})$, and therefore $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$.\nThe splitting field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7, \\nu)$ where $\\nu^7 = \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ is a Kummer extension of degree 7, provided that $x^7 - \\alpha$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$. This is true if $\\alpha$ is not a 7th power of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$, a condition that holds here.\nSo, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)] = 7$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)][\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7):\\mathbb{Q}] = 7 \\cdot 6 = 42$.\nThe Galois group $G$ is a group of order 42. It is a semidirect product $C_7 \\rtimes C_6$, where $C_7 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7))$ and $C_6 = \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q})$. This group is isomorphic to the group of affine transformations on the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, denoted $AGL_1(\\mathbb{F}_7)$.\n$AGL_1(\\mathbb{F}_7) = \\{ T_{a,b}(x) = ax+b \\mid a \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^*, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7 \\}$. The order of this group is $|\\mathbb{F}_7^*| \\cdot |\\mathbb{F}_7| = 6 \\cdot 7 = 42$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem**\n\nThe Chebotarev density theorem states that the natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ that have the corresponding cycle structure when acting on the roots of $f(x)$.\n\nFor $f(x)$ to be irreducible modulo $p$, the corresponding Frobenius element Frob$_p$ in $G$ must act as a single cycle on the 7 roots. This means Frob$_p$ must be a 7-cycle.\nOur task is to find the proportion of 7-cycles in $G = AGL_1(\\mathbb{F}_7)$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the 7-cycles in the Galois group**\n\nWe can identify the roots $\\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_6\\}$ with the indices $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 6\\}$ which form the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$. An element $T_{a,b} \\in AGL_1(\\mathbb{F}_7)$ acts on the indices by the permutation $\\pi(k) = ak+b$. We need to find for which pairs $(a,b)$ this permutation is a 7-cycle.\n\nA permutation on a set of 7 elements is a 7-cycle if and only if it has no fixed points.\nWe need to find the number of pairs $(a,b)$ for which the equation $k = ak+b$ has no solution for $k \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$.\nThe equation for a fixed point is $(1-a)k \\equiv b \\pmod 7$.\n\nCase 1: $a=1$.\nThe equation becomes $0 \\cdot k \\equiv b \\pmod 7$, which is $0 \\equiv b \\pmod 7$.\n- If $b=0$, the equation is $0 \\equiv 0$, which is true for all $k$. The permutation is the identity, fixing all 7 elements.\n- If $b \\neq 0$ (i.e., $b \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$), the equation $0 \\equiv b$ has no solution. The permutation has no fixed points and is therefore a 7-cycle.\nThere are 6 such elements: $(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)$.\n\nCase 2: $a \\neq 1$.\nIn this case, $(1-a)$ is a non-zero element of $\\mathbb{F}_7$ and thus has a multiplicative inverse. The equation $(1-a)k = b$ has a unique solution for $k$: $k = b(1-a)^{-1}$.\nThis means that for any $a \\neq 1$, the permutation has exactly one fixed point. A permutation on 7 elements with a fixed point cannot be a 7-cycle.\n\nSo, the elements in $G$ that act as 7-cycles on the roots are precisely the 6 elements of the form $(1,b)$ with $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^*$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the density**\n\nThe density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total size of the group.\nNumber of 7-cycles = 6.\nSize of the Galois group $|G| = 42$.\nDensity = $\\frac{6}{42} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nFinal check of the points:\n- The polynomial's structure is correctly identified.\n- The structure of the roots and the splitting field is correct for this family of polynomials.\n- The identification of the Galois group with $AGL_1(\\mathbb{F}_7)$ is a standard result for these polynomials under non-degenerate conditions, which are met.\n- The application of Chebotarev's density theorem is correct.\n- The counting of 7-cycles within the affine group is correct.\n- The final calculation is correct.\n\nThe natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$ is $1/7$.\n\n<<<1/7>>>"
