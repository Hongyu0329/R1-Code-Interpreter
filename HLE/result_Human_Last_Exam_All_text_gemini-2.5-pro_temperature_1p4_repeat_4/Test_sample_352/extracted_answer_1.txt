The best replacement for the four amino acids at positions 47-50 (S-E-E-D) is to mutate all of them to Alanine (A). This would create the sequence A-A-A-A, which would be neutral, non-phosphorylatable, and minimally disruptive, effectively testing the hypothesis that the negative charge of the native patch is responsible for autoinhibition.
