    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Γ).\n\n### Step 1: Framework for Counting Subgroups\nThe number of subgroups of a given index `n` in a group `G` can be determined by analyzing the homomorphisms from `G` to the symmetric group `S_n`.\nLet `H` be a subgroup of `G` with index `[G:H]=n`. The action of `G` on the set of left cosets `G/H` induces a homomorphism `φ: G → S_n`. The image of this homomorphism, `Im(φ)`, is a transitive subgroup of `S_n`. The kernel of this homomorphism is the core of `H` in `G`, `Core_G(H) = ∩_{g∈G} gHg⁻¹`.\n\nFor our problem, `G=Γ` and `n=4`. A key property of the Grigorchuk group `Γ` is that it is a 2-group (every element has order a power of 2). Consequently, any finite quotient of `Γ` must be a 2-group. This means `Im(φ)` must be a transitive 2-subgroup of `S_4`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Transitive 2-Subgroups of S₄\nThe group `S₄` has order `4! = 24 = 3 × 8`. Its transitive subgroups must have an order divisible by 4. The transitive subgroups of `S₄` are, up to conjugacy:\n1.  The cyclic group `C₄` (order 4)\n2.  The Klein four-group `V₄` (order 4)\n3.  The dihedral group `D₄` (order 8, Sylow 2-subgroup of `S₄`)\n4.  The alternating group `A₄` (order 12)\n5.  The symmetric group `S₄` (order 24)\n\nSince `Γ` is a 2-group, its homomorphic images must be 2-groups. This eliminates `A₄` and `S₄`. `C₄` is also not a possible quotient, as we will see in Step 3. Thus, the image of any homomorphism `φ: Γ → S₄` corresponding to a subgroup of index 4 must be isomorphic to `V₄` or `D₄`.\n\nWe can classify the subgroups `H` of index 4 into two cases:\n-   Case 1: `H` is a normal subgroup.\n-   Case 2: `H` is not a normal subgroup.\n\n### Step 3: Case 1 - Normal Subgroups of Index 4\nIf `H` is a normal subgroup of `Γ` of index 4, then the quotient group `Γ/H` has order 4.\nThe abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be `Γ/[Γ,Γ] ≅ (Z/2Z)³`.\nAny homomorphism from `Γ` to an abelian group must factor through the abelianization.\n-   If `Γ/H ≅ C₄` (cyclic group of order 4), this would imply a surjective homomorphism from `Γ` to `C₄`. This map would have to factor through `Γ_{ab} = (Z/2Z)³`. However, any homomorphism from `(Z/2Z)³` to `C₄` must have an image of order at most 2 (as every element in the domain has order 2). Thus, `Γ` has no quotient isomorphic to `C₄`.\n-   If `Γ/H ≅ V₄` (Klein four-group, `V₄ ≅ (Z/2Z)²`), this is possible. A surjective homomorphism `Γ → V₄` corresponds to a surjective homomorphism `(Z/2Z)³ → (Z/2Z)²`.\nThe number of such normal subgroups `H` is equal to the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms from `Γ` to `V₄`. Since `V₄` is abelian, this is the same as counting the number of kernels of surjective maps from `Γ_{ab}` to `V₄`.\nA homomorphism `f: (Z/2Z)³ → (Z/2Z)²` is determined by its kernel, which is a subspace of `(Z/2Z)³` of dimension `dim((Z/2Z)³) - dim((Z/2Z)²) = 3 - 2 = 1`.\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in the vector space `(Z/2Z)³` is the number of non-zero vectors divided by the number of non-zero vectors in a 1-dimensional space.\nNumber of 1-D subspaces = `(2³ - 1) / (2¹ - 1) = 7 / 1 = 7`.\nEach of these 7 kernels corresponds to a unique normal subgroup of index 4.\n\nSo, there are **7** normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n### Step 4: Case 2 - Non-Normal Subgroups of Index 4\nLet `H` be a non-normal subgroup of `Γ` with index 4. Let `K = Core_Γ(H)`. The quotient `Γ/K` is isomorphic to a transitive subgroup of `S₄`, which must be a 2-group.\n-   If `Γ/K ≅ V₄`, then `[Γ:K]=4`. Since `K ⊆ H`, we must have `H=K`, which would mean `H` is normal. This contradicts our assumption for this case.\n-   Therefore, we must have `Γ/K ≅ D₄`, the dihedral group of order 8. This implies `[Γ:K] = 8`.\n\nWe have `[Γ:H] = [Γ:K] / [H:K]`. So, `4 = 8 / [H:K]`, which implies `[H:K] = 2`.\nSo, any non-normal subgroup `H` of index 4 contains a normal subgroup `K` of index 8 where `Γ/K ≅ D₄`, and `H/K` is a subgroup of `D₄` of order `8/4=2`, no, index 2. Let's correct this:\n`[Γ:H] = [Γ:K] / [H:K]` is wrong. It should be `[Γ:K] = [Γ:H][H:K]`.\n`8 = 4 * [H:K]`, which gives `[H:K] = 2`.\nThe subgroup `H` corresponds to a subgroup `L = H/K` of `D₄`. The index of `L` in `D₄` is `[D₄:L] = [Γ/K : H/K] = [Γ:H] = 4`.\nSo `L` must be a subgroup of `D₄` of order `8/4 = 2`.\n\nNow we need to count these subgroups `H`. This depends on two things:\n1.  The number of normal subgroups `K` such that `Γ/K ≅ D₄`.\n2.  For each such `K`, the number of subgroups `L` of `D₄` of order 2 that are not normal in `D₄` (since we need `H` to be non-normal).\n\nIt is a known result from the study of the Grigorchuk group that there is a **unique** normal subgroup `K` of `Γ` such that `Γ/K ≅ D₄`. This subgroup `K` is the stabilizer of the second level of the binary tree, `Stab_Γ(2)`.\n\nNext, we count the number of subgroups of order 2 in `D₄`. A `D₄` group has 5 elements of order 2, which generate 5 distinct subgroups of order 2.\n-   One of these is the center, `Z(D₄)`. This subgroup is normal in `D₄`. If `L = Z(D₄)`, then `H = π⁻¹(L)` (where `π: Γ → Γ/K` is the projection) is a normal subgroup of `Γ`. This subgroup `H` has `Γ/H ≅ D₄/Z(D₄) ≅ V₄`, so it is one of the 7 normal subgroups counted in Step 3.\n-   The other four subgroups of order 2 in `D₄` are not normal. Let them be `L₁, L₂, L₃, L₄`.\n\nFor each of these 4 non-normal subgroups `Lᵢ`, we get a subgroup `Hᵢ = π⁻¹(Lᵢ)` of index 4 in `Γ`. Since `Lᵢ` is not normal in `D₄`, the corresponding `Hᵢ` is not normal in `Γ`. These four subgroups are distinct because their images `Lᵢ` in the quotient `Γ/K` are distinct.\n\nThus, there are **4** non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the normal and non-normal ones.\n-   Number of normal subgroups of index 4 = 7\n-   Number of non-normal subgroups of index 4 = 4\n\nTotal number of subgroups of index 4 = 7 + 4 = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
