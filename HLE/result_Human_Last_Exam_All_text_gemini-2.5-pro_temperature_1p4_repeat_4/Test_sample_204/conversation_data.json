    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Hopf Charge and the Vector Field\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) of a map `n: R^3 U {∞} -> S^2` is a topological invariant that characterizes how the domain space is \"knotted\" or \"linked\" by the map. A standard way to calculate it is to find the linking number of the preimages of two distinct regular points on the target sphere `S^2`.\n\nThe given vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is a map from 3D space `(x, y, z)` to the unit sphere `S^2`, since `nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = sin^2(G)cos^2(f) + sin^2(G)sin^2(f) + cos^2(G) = sin^2(G) + cos^2(G) = 1`.\n\nThe components are defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`: This is the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates `(ρ, f, z)`.\n*   `ρ = sqrt(x^2+y^2)`.\n*   `r2 = sqrt((ρ^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2)`. This is the distance from a circle of radius `sqrt(0.5)` in the `z=0` plane.\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`. This will serve as the polar angle on the target sphere.\n*   `n = (sin(G)cos(f), sin(G)sin(f), cos(G))`.\n\nThe point at infinity in `R^3` (`x,y,z -> ∞`) corresponds to `r2 -> ∞`, which means `G -> 0`. In this limit, `n -> (0, 0, 1)`, the North Pole of `S^2`. This means the map can be considered as a map from the compactified `R^3`, which is topologically an `S^3`, to `S^2`.\n\n### Step 2: Choose Two Points on the Target Sphere `S^2`\n\nTo calculate the linking number, we choose two regular points on `S^2`. Let's pick:\n1.  The South Pole: `p_S = (0, 0, -1)`\n2.  A point on the equator: `p_E = (1, 0, 0)`\n\n### Step 3: Find the Preimage of the South Pole `p_S`\n\nWe need to find the set of points `(x, y, z)` for which `n(x, y, z) = p_S`.\n`n = (0, 0, -1)` implies:\n*   `nz = cos(G) = -1`\n*   `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 0`\n*   `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 0`\n\nFrom `cos(G) = -1`, we get `G = π` (since the range of `G` is `(0, π]`).\n`G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) = π`\n`exp(-10 * r2) = 1`\n`-10 * r2 = 0`, which means `r2 = 0`.\n\nFrom the definition of `r2`:\n`r2 = sqrt((ρ^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2) = 0`\nThis is only true if both terms under the square root are zero:\n*   `z = 0`\n*   `(ρ^2 - 0.5)^2 = 0  => ρ^2 = 0.5 => ρ = 1/sqrt(2)`\n\nSince `ρ^2 = x^2 + y^2`, the preimage of the South Pole is a circle `C_S` in the `z=0` plane, centered at the origin with radius `1/sqrt(2)`.\n`C_S: x^2 + y^2 = 0.5, z = 0`.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Preimage of the Equatorial Point `p_E`\n\nNow, we find the preimage for `n(x, y, z) = p_E = (1, 0, 0)`.\n*   `nz = cos(G) = 0`\n*   `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1`\n*   `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 0`\n\nFrom `cos(G) = 0`, we get `G = π/2`.\nFrom `sin(π/2)sin(f) = 0`, we get `sin(f) = 0`.\nFrom `sin(π/2)cos(f) = 1`, we get `cos(f) = 1`.\n`sin(f) = 0` and `cos(f) = 1` together imply that the azimuthal angle `f = 0`. This corresponds to the half-plane `y=0, x>0`.\n\nNow we use the condition on `G`:\n`G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) = π/2`\n`exp(-10 * r2) = 1/2`\n`-10 * r2 = ln(1/2) = -ln(2)`\n`r2 = ln(2) / 10`\n\nSquaring this gives: `r2^2 = (ln(2) / 10)^2`.\nSubstituting the definition of `r2` and `ρ=x` (since `y=0`):\n`(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2) / 10)^2`.\n\nThis equation describes a closed loop `C_E` in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Linking Number `Lk(C_S, C_E)`\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` is the linking number of the two curves `C_S` and `C_E`. We can calculate this by considering a surface `S_E` bounded by the loop `C_E` and counting the signed number of times `C_S` intersects `S_E`.\n\n1.  **Surface and Intersections**: Let `S_E` be the flat disk in the `y=0` plane bounded by `C_E`. The circle `C_S` lies in the `z=0` plane and intersects the `y=0` plane (which contains `S_E`) at two points: `P1 = (1/sqrt(2), 0, 0)` and `P2 = (-1/sqrt(2), 0, 0)`.\n    Since `C_E` (and `S_E`) is in the `x>0` half-plane, we only need to consider `P1`. The point `P1` lies inside the loop `C_E` because for `x=1/sqrt(2)` and `z=0`, the equation for the boundary `C_E` gives `((1/sqrt(2))^2 - 0.5)^2 + 0^2 = 0`, which is less than or equal to `(ln(2)/10)^2`. Thus, `C_S` intersects `S_E` exactly once.\n\n2.  **Orientation and Sign**: To find the sign of the intersection, we need to orient the curves.\n    *   **Orientation of `C_S`**: We give `C_S` the standard counter-clockwise orientation in the `xy`-plane. At the intersection point `P1`, the tangent vector to `C_S` points in the `+y` direction.\n    *   **Orientation of `C_E`**: The parametrization `x = sqrt(0.5 + (ln2/10)cos(t))`, `z = (ln2/10)sin(t)` traces the loop `C_E` in the `xz`-plane. As `t` goes from `0` to `2π`, the loop is traced clockwise. By the right-hand rule, a clockwise orientation in the `xz`-plane gives a normal vector for the surface `S_E` that points in the `-y` direction.\n    *   **Sign Calculation**: The sign of the intersection is given by the sign of the dot product of the tangent vector of the intersecting curve and the normal vector of the surface.\n        `sign = sign( (tangent of C_S) . (normal of S_E) ) = sign( (+y_direction) . (-y_direction) ) = -1`.\n\nThe linking number is -1.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nThe Hopf charge is equal to the linking number of the preimages. Based on the calculation, the linking number is -1.\n\nFinal Answer: The Hopf charge of this field is -1.\n\n<<< -1 >>>"
