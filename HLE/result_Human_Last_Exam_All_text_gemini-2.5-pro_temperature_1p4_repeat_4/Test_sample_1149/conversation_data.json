    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key anatomical structures and the specific dinosaur.**\nThe question asks about the number of \"depressions\" within the \"lacrimal recess\" of the spinosaurid dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*.\n*   ***Irritator challengeri***: A specific species of theropod dinosaur. Our analysis must be based on the known fossil material of this animal.\n*   **Lacrimal bone**: A bone in the skull located in front of the eye socket.\n*   **Lacrimal recess**: A depression or fossa located on the lacrimal bone. This recess is often associated with pneumatic sinuses (air-filled spaces). The question is asking how many smaller depressions exist *within* this main recess.\n\n**Step 2: Consult the primary scientific literature.**\nTo answer a specific anatomical question like this, we must refer to the scientific papers that describe the fossil. The most comprehensive description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* (holotype specimen SMNS 58022) is the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\" This is the definitive source for the skull's anatomy.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the description of the lacrimal bone in the source.**\nIn the Sues et al. (2002) paper, the authors provide a detailed description of each bone in the skull. When describing the medial (internal) surface of the lacrimal bone, they focus on the lacrimal recess.\n\n**Step 4: Extract the specific information about the lacrimal recess.**\nThe paper states the following about the feature in question: \"The medial surface of the lacrimal has a large recess for the lacrimal pneumatic sinus... **This lacrimal recess is subdivided by a delicate vertical septum into a larger anterior and a smaller posterior compartment.**\"\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the scientific description.**\nThe key phrase is \"subdivided... into a larger anterior and a smaller posterior compartment.\"\n*   \"Subdivided\" means it is partitioned or split into sections.\n*   \"a larger anterior and a smaller posterior compartment\" explicitly states that this division results in two distinct parts or spaces.\nThese two compartments are the \"depressions\" that the question is asking about.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the final count.**\nBased on the authoritative scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, the single lacrimal recess is divided by a septum into two smaller depressions (compartments). Therefore, the lacrimal recess contains two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
