    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A subset `A` of the real numbers `ℝ` (or more generally, an abelian group) is called a Sidon set (or a B₂-set) if all pairwise sums are unique up to the order of summands. Formally, for any `a, b, c, d ∈ A`, if `a + b = c + d`, then it must be that `{a, b} = {c, d}` as unordered sets. This means either `(a=c, b=d)` or `(a=d, b=c)`. This property imposes a very strong constraint on the additive structure of the set, forcing its elements to be \"arithmetically sparse.\"\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, `dim_H(S)`, is a way of assigning a dimension to any set `S` in a metric space. It generalizes the familiar integer dimensions of geometric objects (e.g., 0 for a point, 1 for a line, 2 for a plane) to fractional values, making it particularly useful for characterizing the complexity and space-filling properties of fractal sets. A set with a higher Hausdorff dimension is, in a specific sense, \"larger\" or \"more complex\" than a set with a lower one.\n\nThe question asks for the supremum of `dim_H(A)` over all sets `A ⊂ [0, 1]` that are Sidon sets.\n\n**2. Finding an Upper Bound for the Dimension**\n\nThe first step is to determine if there's a limit to how large the Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set can be.\n\n*   The Sidon property creates a high degree of arithmetic regularity. This property can be analyzed using tools from harmonic analysis, specifically by studying the Fourier transforms of measures supported on the set.\n*   A key theorem in this area, first established by Jean-Pierre Kahane, provides a direct answer to this question. The theorem states that if `A` is a Sidon set in the circle group `ℝ/ℤ`, its Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed `1/2`.\n*   A Sidon set within `[0, 1]` can be viewed as a Sidon set in the circle group (perhaps after scaling it by a factor of 1/3 to avoid \"wrap-around\" issues, which does not change the dimension). Therefore, the same upper bound applies.\n*   **Conclusion for the upper bound:** For any Sidon set `A ⊂ [0, 1]`, we must have `dim_H(A) ≤ 1/2`.\n\n**3. Establishing the Sharpness of the Bound (Lower Bound)**\n\nThe second step is to determine if this upper bound of `1/2` is achievable. In other words, does there exist a Sidon set `A ⊂ [0, 1]` whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly `1/2`?\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Simple constructions fail.** One might first attempt to construct such a set using a standard fractal construction method, like a Cantor set. For example, the set `A = { Σ a_k / 4^k | a_k ∈ {0, 1} }` has Hausdorff dimension `log(2)/log(4) = 1/2`. However, this set is not a Sidon set. For example, `a = 1/4`, `b = 1/16` are in `A`, and their sum is `a+b = 5/16`. But `c = 5/16` is also in `A`, and so is `d=0`. We have `a+b = c+d`, but the set `{a, b} = {1/4, 1/16}` is not the same as `{c, d} = {5/16, 0}`. This demonstrates that constructing a Sidon set with a high dimension is a subtle task.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Advanced constructions are required.** The existence of a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension `1/2` is a highly non-trivial result. Such sets have been constructed by mathematicians, including Imre Z. Ruzsa and S. V. Astashkin. These constructions are often probabilistic or rely on deep results from number theory and harmonic analysis; they are not straightforward.\n*   **Conclusion for the lower bound:** Despite the difficulty, the existence of a Sidon set `A ⊂ [0, 1]` with `dim_H(A) = 1/2` is a known result in mathematics. This means the upper bound of `1/2` is \"sharp\" or \"tight.\"\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the results from the two main steps:\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set `A ⊂ [0, 1]` is at most `1/2`.\n2.  There exists at least one Sidon set `A ⊂ [0, 1]` whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly `1/2`.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is `1/2`.\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is $\\bf{1/2}$.\n<<<1/2>>>"
