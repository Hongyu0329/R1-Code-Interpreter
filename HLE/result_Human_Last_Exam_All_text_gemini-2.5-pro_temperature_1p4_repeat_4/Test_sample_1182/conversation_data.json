    "An elegant problem that requires understanding the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve over a p-adic field. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points.\n\n**Step 1: Define the curve and the field**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation:\n$C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nThe analysis is to be done over the 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a better model for the curve**\n\nThe given equation is a model for the curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Reducing the equation modulo 2, we get:\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nThis simplifies to $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, or $y \\equiv x \\pmod{2}$. The special fiber is a \"double line,\" which is a highly singular and non-reduced scheme. This indicates that the given model is not good for studying the reduction, and we need to find a more suitable one through a change of variables.\n\nA standard technique is to use transformations of the form $x \\to u^m x'$ and $y \\to u^n y'$, where $u$ is a uniformizer (here, $u=2$), to find a model with better reduction properties. Let's try the transformation $x = x'/2$ and $y=y'/2$.\nSubstituting into the original equation:\n$(\\frac{y'}{2})^2 = 8(\\frac{x'}{2}) + (\\frac{x'}{2})^2 + 4(\\frac{x'}{2})^3 + 4(\\frac{x'}{2})^4 + 8(\\frac{x'}{2})^5$\n$\\frac{(y')^2}{4} = 4x' + \\frac{(x')^2}{4} + \\frac{4(x')^3}{8} + \\frac{4(x')^4}{16} + \\frac{8(x')^5}{32}$\n$\\frac{(y')^2}{4} = 4x' + \\frac{(x')^2}{4} + \\frac{(x')^3}{2} + \\frac{(x')^4}{4} + \\frac{(x')^5}{4}$\n\nTo get an integral model (coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$), we multiply the entire equation by 4:\n$(y')^2 = 16x' + (x')^2 + 2(x')^3 + (x')^4 + (x')^5$\n\nRearranging and dropping the primes, we get a new model, let's call it $C'$, for the same curve over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$:\n$C': y^2 = x^5 + x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 16x$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reduction of the new model**\n\nNow, we reduce the equation for $C'$ modulo 2:\n$y^2 \\equiv x^5 + x^4 + x^2 \\pmod{2}$\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2(x^3 + x^2 + 1) \\pmod{2}$\n\nThe special fiber $\\mathcal{C}'_0$ is a singular curve over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The polynomial $P(x) = x^3+x^2+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ because it has no roots ($P(0)=1, P(1)=1$). This special fiber is singular at $(x,y)=(0,0)$. The equation shows that it is composed of a rational component (a cuspidal curve $y^2=x^2(\\dots)$) and an elliptic curve component ($Y^2=x^3+x^2+1$ after birational transformation). This model is still not the stable model, but it is better. The stable model is found by resolving the singularities of the scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Resolve the singularities via blowing up**\n\nThe scheme for $C'$ is singular at the point corresponding to $(x,y)=(0,0)$ on the special fiber. We perform a blow-up at this point. In local coordinates, this means substituting $y = y_1x$ and simplifying.\n$(y_1x)^2 = x^5 + x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 16x$\n$y_1^2 x^2 = x(x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 16)$\nDividing by $x$ (we are away from the exceptional divisor $x=0$):\n$y_1^2 x = x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 16$\n\nLet's call this new model $\\mathcal{M}$ and its variables $x, y$. Its special fiber over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is found by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n$y^2 x \\equiv x^4 + x^3 + x \\pmod{2}$\n$x(y^2 - (x^3 + x^2 + 1)) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n\nThe special fiber of this blown-up model consists of two components:\n1.  A line $L$ given by $x=0$. This is the exceptional divisor of the blow-up. As a curve, it is isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$.\n2.  A curve $E$ given by $y^2 = x^3 + x^2 + 1$. Since the polynomial $x^3+x^2+1$ is irreducible and has distinct roots in an extension field, this is a non-singular elliptic curve (a curve of genus 1).\n\nThese two components intersect where $x=0$ on $E$. Substituting $x=0$ into the equation for $E$ gives $y^2=1$, so $y=1$ (in $\\mathbb{F}_2$). They intersect at a single point $P=(x,y)=(0,1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure of the stable reduction**\n\nA model whose special fiber consists of smooth components intersecting transversally is called a semistable model. Our model $\\mathcal{M}$ is not yet semistable, as the total scheme can be shown to be singular at the intersection point $P$.\n\nHowever, the theory of stable reduction tells us that the stable model is obtained by resolving these singularities and then contracting any rational components (isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$) that are \"superfluous\" (specifically, those that have self-intersection -1, often called (-1)-curves).\n\nIn our case, the special fiber consists of an elliptic curve $E$ and a rational curve $L$ intersecting at one point. The resolution of the singularity at the intersection point may introduce a chain of rational curves. After resolution, we get a semistable model whose special fiber is a tree of components, one of which is the elliptic curve $\\tilde{E}$ (the strict transform of $E$), and the others are rational curves.\n\nThe process of stable reduction involves contracting any rational component that meets the rest of the configuration at a single point. In our tree of components, this process would contract all rational curves, including the strict transform $\\tilde{L}$, until we are left with just the elliptic curve component $\\tilde{E}$. When the rational component $\\tilde{L}$ is contracted, the point where it was attached to $\\tilde{E}$ becomes a self-intersection point (a node or a double point) on $\\tilde{E}$.\n\nThe resulting stable reduction is therefore an elliptic curve with one double point. The genus of such a curve is $g = g_{elliptic} + \\delta = 1 + 1 = 2$, which matches the genus of the original curve.\n\nThus, the stable reduction has exactly one double point."
