    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the \"rule activation level\" for a rule in an Interval Type-3 (IT3) fuzzy system. This level determines the contribution of a specific rule to the final output.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components:**\n    *   **Rule Structure:** A fuzzy rule generally has the form \"IF <antecedent condition> THEN <consequent action>\".\n    *   **Antecedent Firing Level `Phi_k(x′)`:** This value represents how well the input `x'` matches the antecedent condition of the k-th rule. It is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This value is also known as the rule's firing strength.\n    *   **Consequent Membership `μG_k_j(y_j)`:** This value represents the membership degree of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` of the k-th rule. It is given as `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n    *   **Implication Operator (t-norm):** The rule activation level is computed by combining the antecedent firing level with the consequent membership function. This combination is done using a fuzzy implication operator, which is typically a t-norm (fuzzy intersection).\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Interval Type-3\" Context:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Simplification.** In a true Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Logic System, the firing level `Phi_k(x′)` and the consequent membership `μG_k_j(y_j)` would not be single crisp numbers. They would be Type-2 fuzzy sets. The problem simplifies this by providing single numerical values. We must assume these values represent the specific membership grades (likely the upper membership grades) that need to be combined. The fundamental principle of combining them via a t-norm remains the same.\n\n4.  **Select the t-norm Operator:**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Unspecified t-norm.** The question states to use a \"t-norm operation\" but does not specify which one (e.g., minimum, product, etc.).\n    *   **Standard Convention:** In fuzzy logic, when the specific t-norm for implication (in a Mamdani-style system) is not specified, the most common and standard choice is the **minimum** operator. The product operator is another common choice. We will proceed using the standard minimum t-norm.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The rule activation level is the result of applying the chosen t-norm to the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree.\n    *   Formula: `Activation Level = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   Using the minimum t-norm: `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   Calculation: The minimum of 0.7 and 0.9 is 0.7.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The rule activation level, which scales the consequent fuzzy set, is determined by the t-norm of the rule's firing strength and the original consequent membership. Based on the standard minimum operator, the activation level is 0.7.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Antecedent Firing Level:** 0.7\n*   **Consequent Membership:** 0.9\n*   **Operation:** t-norm (assumed to be `min`)\n*   **Result:** `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
