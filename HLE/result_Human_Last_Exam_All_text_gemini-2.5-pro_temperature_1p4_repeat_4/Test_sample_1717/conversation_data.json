    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify Base Health Values**\n\nFirst, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu. The health scaling for multiplayer in Expert Mode depends on both its Classic Mode health and its base Expert Mode health.\n*   **Classic Mode Health:** The Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2,800 HP.\n*   **Expert Mode Health (1 Player):** In Expert Mode, its base health is increased to 3,640 HP.\n\n**2. Determine the Health Scaling Formula for Multiplayer**\n\nIn Expert Mode, boss health increases for each player present in the world. According to the game's source code, the formula for this increase is based on the boss's *Classic Mode* health.\n*   **Bonus Health per Player:** For each player beyond the first, an amount of health equal to 35% of the boss's Classic Mode health is added.\n    *   Bonus = `2800 * 0.35 = 980` HP per additional player.\n*   **Full Formula:** Let 'n' be the number of players. The total health `(H)` is calculated as:\n    *   `H(n) = (Base Expert Health) + (Bonus Health per Player) * (n - 1)`\n    *   `H(n) = 3640 + 980 * (n - 1)`\n\n**3. Analyze the Formula with a Theoretical \"Infinite\" Number of Players**\n\nThe question poses a hypothetical scenario with an infinite number of players to find the absolute maximum health.\n*   The health formula `H(n) = 3640 + 980n - 980` simplifies to `H(n) = 2660 + 980n`.\n*   This is a linear equation. As the number of players (`n`) approaches infinity, the calculated health (`H(n)`) also approaches infinity.\n\n**4. Consider the Game Engine's Technical Limitations**\n\nA purely mathematical analysis suggests infinite health. However, the game itself has technical limits based on its programming. The term \"theoretical maximum\" implies we should find the highest value the game is capable of handling.\n*   **Data Type:** In the Terraria source code, an NPC's health (`life` and `lifeMax`) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n*   **Maximum Value:** A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. This value acts as a hard cap on any variable of this type. Any calculation that exceeds this value will result in an overflow, but the game's code will not assign a health value higher than this limit.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nThe maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is `2^31 - 1`.\n*   `2^31 = 2,147,483,648`\n*   `2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`\n\nTherefore, while the health scaling formula would produce infinitely large numbers with infinite players, the actual health value is capped by the maximum value of the data type used to store it in the game's code.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The multiplayer health bonus is calculated from the boss's **Classic Mode** health, not its Expert Mode health. This is a common detail in Terraria's scaling that is crucial for the correct calculation.\n*   The question involves a hypothetical (\"infinite players\") that pushes us to find the absolute system limit rather than a limit achievable with a practical number of players (e.g., 255).\n*   The key to the correct answer lies in understanding the technical constraints of the game engine (the 32-bit integer limit) and not just the mathematical formula.\n*   The health of the boss is set once when it spawns. The fact that it loses health or enters a second phase does not change its initial maximum health value.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe theoretical maximum health is the highest value a 32-bit signed integer can hold.\n\n<<<2,147,483,647>>>"
