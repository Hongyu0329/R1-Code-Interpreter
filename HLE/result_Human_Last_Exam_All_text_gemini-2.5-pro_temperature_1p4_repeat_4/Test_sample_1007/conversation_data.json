    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the listed classical ballet steps concludes with the dancer's legs in the same position as they were at the beginning of the step. \"Position\" here refers to the placement of the feet, for example, starting in fifth position with the right foot in front and also ending in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Answer Choices**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a vertical jump from two feet. The name *entrechat* refers to the interweaving or beating of the legs in the air. The number \"six\" denotes six distinct movements of the legs (e.g., open to second, beat behind, open to second, beat in front, open to second, land back in the starting fifth position).\n    *   **Ending Position:** In the family of *entrechats*, steps with an even number (*quatre*, *six*, *huit*) always land back on two feet in the exact same starting position. The even number of crossings ensures the feet return to their original configuration.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The even number is the key. An odd-numbered *entrechat* (like *trois* or *cinq*) would end on one foot, which is a different position.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Starts in a closed position, usually fifth.\n    *   **Execution:** *Échappé* means \"to escape,\" where the feet jump from a closed position to an open one (like second) and then back to a closed one. *Battu* means \"beaten,\" indicating a beat of the legs occurs during the jump. *Changé* means \"changed.\"\n    *   **Ending Position:** The word *changé* is explicit. It dictates that when the feet return to fifth position, they will have switched places. If the dancer started with the right foot in front, they will land with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term *changé* makes the outcome unambiguous.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually begins with the dancer on one supporting leg, with the working leg extended (e.g., to the side). This often follows a preparatory step like a *glissade*.\n    *   **Execution:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" The dancer jumps from the supporting leg while sweeping the working leg in, bringing both legs together (\"assembling\" them) in the air before landing on both feet simultaneously in fifth position. Common forms are *assemblé dessus* (over), where the working leg lands in front, and *assemblé dessous* (under), where it lands in back.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In virtually all standard forms of *assemblé*, the relationship of the feet changes. For example, in an *assemblé dessus*, the leg that was working from the side or back ends up in front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The fundamental purpose of the step is to bring the legs together into a new fifth position.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** *Glissade* means \"to glide.\" It is a connecting, traveling step. *Derrière* means \"behind.\" To perform a *glissade derrière* from fifth position, the dancer glides the back foot out to the side, transfers weight, and then the other foot closes in fifth position *behind* the first one.\n    *   **Ending Position:** This action causes the feet to change. The foot that was originally in front is now in the back.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The directional term (*derrière*, *devant*) indicates how the step finishes, which in this case involves changing the feet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually begins in fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, embellished step, often described as a *pas de chat* with a *rond de jambe* (circular motion) from each leg. In its standard, non-changing form, the dancer jumps, performs the leg circles, and lands back in the original fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In the standard execution, the ending position is the same as the start.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A common variation called *gargouillade changée* exists, where the feet do change places upon landing. Because the step can be performed either with or without changing, the name \"Gargouillade\" by itself is less definitive than \"Entrechat six.\"\n\n**Final Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nComparing all the options, *Échappé battu changé*, *Assemblé*, and *Glissade derrière* all explicitly involve a change in the foot position by their very definition and common execution. Both *Entrechat six* and a standard *Gargouillade* can end in the same position they start. However, the definition of *Entrechat six* is rigid and absolute: the even number guarantees a return to the original position. *Gargouillade* has a common *changé* variant, making it a slightly ambiguous answer without further specification. Therefore, *Entrechat six* is the most accurate and unequivocally correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
