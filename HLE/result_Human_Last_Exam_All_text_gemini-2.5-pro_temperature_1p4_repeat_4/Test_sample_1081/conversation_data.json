    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of the group $G$. In the context of algebraic groups, this is understood to mean the number of conjugacy classes of such tori under the action of the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the fundamental correspondence theorem**\nThere is a fundamental theorem in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ and the set of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n*   **Careful point:** This theorem is the cornerstone of the solution. It transforms a geometric counting problem into a combinatorial problem involving the Weyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Define F-conjugacy**\nLet $W$ be the Weyl group and $F$ be the Frobenius endomorphism acting on $W$. Two elements $w_1, w_2 \\in W$ are said to be in the same $F$-conjugacy class if there exists an element $w' \\in W$ such that:\n$w_2 = (w')^{-1} w_1 F(w')$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the group G, its Weyl group W, and the Frobenius action F**\n*   **The Group G:** The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. The structure of a reductive group over a non-algebraically closed field (like $\\mathbb{F}_q$) depends on its 'form' or 'twist'. These forms are classified by automorphisms of the corresponding Dynkin diagram.\n*   **The Dynkin Diagram of E8:** The Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ is known to have a trivial automorphism group. This means there are no 'outer' forms of $E_8$. All groups of type $E_8$ are 'inner' forms of the split group.\n*   **Steinberg's Theorem:** A key theorem by Steinberg states that for a semi-simple group over a finite field, every inner form is actually the split form.\n*   **Conclusion on G:** Therefore, any reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be the (unique) split group of type $E_8$.\n\n*   **Careful point:** Correctly identifying $G$ as the split group is crucial. This determines the action of the Frobenius endomorphism.\n\n*   **The Weyl Group W:** The Weyl group associated with the root system of type $E_8$ is denoted by $W(E_8)$.\n*   **The Frobenius Action F:** For a split group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the standard Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the root datum (roots, coroots, etc.). Consequently, the induced action of $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is the identity map. That is, $F(w) = w$ for all $w \\in W(E_8)$.\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the F-conjugacy relation**\nSince the action of $F$ on $W(E_8)$ is trivial, the $F$-conjugacy relation simplifies:\n$w_2 = (w')^{-1} w_1 F(w') = (w')^{-1} w_1 w'$\nThis is the definition of a standard conjugacy class in the group $W$.\n\n*   **Careful point:** The simplification from $F$-conjugacy to standard conjugacy is a direct consequence of the splitness of the group $G$.\n\n**Step 6: Reduce the problem to a group-theoretic calculation**\nFrom the steps above, we have established that the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the number of conjugacy classes of W(E8)**\nThe final step is to find the number of conjugacy classes in the finite group $W(E_8)$. This is a known result from the study of reflection groups and has been computed by mathematicians.\nThe number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\n*   **Careful point:** This is a known mathematical fact that one would typically look up in a reliable source (like R.W. Carter's \"Finite Groups of Lie Type\"), rather than compute from first principles.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is independent of $q$ and is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This number is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
