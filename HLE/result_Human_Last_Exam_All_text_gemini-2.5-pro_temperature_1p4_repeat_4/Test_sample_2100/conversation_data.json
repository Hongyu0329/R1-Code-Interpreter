    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\nThe question provides several key pieces of information about an unnamed man:\n1.  **Source:** The quotes are from the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This points to a figure of significance in Russian history or culture.\n2.  **First Quote:** He is called \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This describes him as a maritime explorer with a romantic, adventurous spirit.\n3.  **Second Quote:** Voznesensky asks, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This is a crucial clue, indicating that for a long period, the man's burial site was unknown.\n4.  **Timeline:** The answer to the question about the grave's location \"emerged in the late 1980s\". This provides a specific time frame for the discovery.\n5.  **The Question:** We need to find this man's last name.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues to a Specific Work**\nThe quotes by Voznesensky are from the libretto of the famous Soviet rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). The opera tells the story of a real historical figure. The lines appear in the epilogue, reflecting on the protagonist's fate.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Protagonist**\nThe protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer, Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. Let's check if he fits all the clues.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Protagonist Against the Clues**\n*   **\"A joy-discovering sailor\":** Nikolai Rezanov (1764–1807) was a central figure in the Russian-American Company and one of the leaders of Russia's first circumnavigation of the globe. His life was filled with sea voyages and exploration, and his famous romance with Concepción Argüello in Spanish California, which is the heart of the opera, certainly fits the description of a romantic, \"joy-discovering\" figure.\n*   **\"Where is your grave, even a mound?\":** On his return trip across Siberia from his expeditions, Rezanov fell ill and died in the city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, in the Soviet era, the cathedral was demolished and the cemetery was destroyed, leading to the complete loss of the location of his grave for over 150 years.\n*   **\"The answer... emerged in the late 1980s\":** Fueled by the immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\", a renewed public and historical interest in Rezanov's fate arose. In the late 1980s, historians and archeologists in Krasnoyarsk undertook searches for the lost grave. They were able to identify the likely location of the grave site within the former cathedral grounds. This discovery and public acknowledgment perfectly match the timeframe given in the clue. A monument was later erected on the spot.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Answer**\nAll clues point to Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
