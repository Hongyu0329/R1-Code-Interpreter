    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Setup**\n\n*   We are given a triangle, let's call it $A B C$.\n*   The side length $B C$ is given by $S = S N Y W R$. Based on the context, we'll assume $S=95$. So, $B C = a = 95$.\n*   The angle $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B$ is given as $30^{\\circ}$.\n*   Let the side length $A C = b$ and $A B = c$.\n*   The core of the question is to find the number of *integer* values for the side length $A C$ (which is $b$) such that there are *two possible values* for the side length $A B$ (which is $c$).\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Geometric Condition**\n\nThis problem describes the \"Ambiguous Case\" of the Law of Sines (the Side-Side-Angle or SSA case). When we are given two sides and a non-included angle, there can be zero, one, or two possible triangles that can be formed.\n\n*   We are given side $B C = a = 95$.\n*   We are given angle $\\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n*   We are considering different values for side $A C = b$.\n\nFor there to be **two possible triangles**, and thus two possible values for the third side $AB$, the length of the side opposite the given angle ($AC=b$) must be greater than the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$, but less than the other given side ($BC=a$).\n\n**3. Calculate the Altitude**\n\nLet's find the altitude, $h$, from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$. In the right triangle formed by the altitude, we have:\n$\\sin(B) = \\frac{h}{BC}$\n$h = BC \\cdot \\sin(B)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$h = 95 \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ})$\nSince $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$h = 95 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 47.5$\n\n**4. Formulate the Inequality**\n\nThe condition for having two possible triangles is that the length of side $AC$ (which we called $b$) must be strictly between the altitude $h$ and the length of side $BC$ (which we called $a$).\nCondition: $h < b < a$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$47.5 < AC < 95$\n\n**5. Count the Integer Values**\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of $AC$ that satisfy this inequality. We need to find the number of integers between 47.5 and 95.\n\n*   The smallest integer greater than 47.5 is 48.\n*   The largest integer less than 95 is 94.\n\nSo, we need to count the integers in the inclusive range [48, 94].\nThe number of integers can be calculated as:\nNumber of values = (Last integer) - (First integer) + 1\nNumber of values = $94 - 48 + 1$\nNumber of values = $46 + 1$\nNumber of values = 47\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n\n*   **Correctly identify the case:** The condition \"two possible values for side length AB\" correctly points to the ambiguous case (SSA) of triangle construction.\n*   **Correct sides:** The condition is that the side opposite the given angle ($AC$) must be between the altitude and the other given side ($BC$). It is crucial not to mix these up.\n*   **Strict inequality:** For two solutions, the inequalities are strict ($h < AC < BC$). If $AC = h$, there is one solution (a right triangle). If $AC \\ge BC$, there is also only one solution.\n*   **Integer counting:** Ensure the final step correctly counts the integers in the resulting range. The formula `Last - First + 1` is correctly applied to the inclusive range of integers.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the conclusion that there are 47 possible integer values for the side length $AC$.\n\n<<<47>>>"
