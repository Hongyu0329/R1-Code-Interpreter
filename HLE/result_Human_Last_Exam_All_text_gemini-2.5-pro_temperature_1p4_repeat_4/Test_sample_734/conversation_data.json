    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the question.**\n    *   **Who:** We are looking for a specific \"Christian theologian.\"\n    *   **What did they do:** They \"first developed specialized terminology.\" This implies a unique set of terms or a specific conceptual framework, not just a general discussion.\n    *   **What does the terminology describe:** \"Changes in the laws of nature.\" This can mean a temporary suspension of a law (a miracle) or a permanent alteration of the system of laws.\n    *   **What are the applications:** The terminology must be applicable to two specific scenarios:\n        1.  The \"virgin birth of Jesus\" (a singular, miraculous event).\n        2.  \"Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall\" (a systemic, foundational change in how the natural world operates).\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate potential theologians and their concepts.**\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** A foundational figure. He discussed miracles extensively. His concept of *rationes seminales* (\"seminal reasons\" or \"hidden seeds\") posits that God embedded all future possibilities, including miracles, into creation from the beginning. A miracle, then, is not a violation of nature but the emergence of a pre-planned potentiality. While this addresses miracles like the virgin birth, it doesn't quite provide a framework for a *change* or *alteration* in the laws themselves post-Fall. It sees nature's order as fundamentally stable, with God's miraculous acts being part of a deeper, pre-written plan within that order.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274 AD):** A central figure of scholastic theology. He is famous for his synthesis of Christian doctrine and Aristotelian philosophy. To explain God's action in the world, Aquinas formalized a crucial distinction:\n        *   ***Potentia Dei Ordinata*** **(God's Ordained Power):** This refers to God's power as He has chosen to exercise it within the created order He established. This is the regular, predictable functioning of the universe according to the \"laws of nature.\"\n        *   ***Potentia Dei Absoluta*** **(God's Absolute Power):** This refers to God's sheer ability to do anything that is not logically contradictory. It is the power of God considered in itself, apart from the specific order He has willed for creation. Miracles are acts of God's absolute power, where He acts outside the normal course of His ordained power.\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply Aquinas's terminology to the question's criteria.**\n    *   **Is it \"specialized terminology\"?** Yes, *potentia ordinata* and *potentia absoluta* are precise, technical Latin terms central to scholastic theology.\n    *   **Is Aquinas the first to develop it?** While the concepts had earlier roots, Aquinas is credited with giving this distinction its classic, systematic formulation and making it a cornerstone of his theological system.\n    *   **Can it describe the virgin birth?** Perfectly. The virgin birth is explained as an act of God's *potentia absoluta* (absolute power), by which He bypasses the normal biological process established under His *potentia ordinata* (ordained power).\n    *   **Can it describe alterations in natural laws at the Fall?** Yes. This framework allows a theologian to argue that the pre-Fall world operated under a different *potentia ordinata* (a different set of established natural laws). After the Fall, God, in His sovereign judgment and by His absolute will, could have instituted a *new potentia ordinata* for the world, one that now includes principles like decay, suffering, and death (\"thorns and thistles\") that were not part of the original created order. The terminology thus provides a mechanism for describing a fundamental change in the \"laws of nature.\"\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude.**\n    Thomas Aquinas is the theologian who first systematized the specialized terminology of *potentia ordinata* and *potentia absoluta*. This framework is uniquely suited to explain both singular miracles like the virgin birth (as an act of *potentia absoluta* superseding *potentia ordinata*) and a systemic change in the natural order at the Fall (as God instituting a new *potentia ordinata*).\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
