    "*   **Step 1: Define Cambré Derrière**\n    *   *Cambré* is a French ballet term meaning \"arched\" or \"bent.\" *Derrière* means \"to the back.\" Therefore, a *cambré derrière* is a backbend, where the body bends backward from the waist. This movement is designed to increase spinal flexibility and demonstrate control.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach to Cambré Derrière**\n    *   The Vaganova method, a Russian school of training, emphasizes purity of line, stability, and strength.\n    *   In a Vaganova *cambré derrière*, the movement originates from the upper and middle back. The dancer lifts the sternum towards the ceiling.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A crucial rule in the Vaganova method is to keep the hips stable and directly over the supporting legs. The pelvis does not move forward. The goal is to create a long, unbroken curve in the spine, supported by strong core and back muscles. This isolates the bend to the vertebral column, protecting the lower back and promoting correct muscular development.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's/Style's Approach to Cambré Derrière**\n    *   The Balanchine style, developed for the New York City Ballet, is known for its speed, musicality, and dynamic, often exaggerated lines.\n    *   In a Balanchine *cambré derrière*, a common stylistic choice is to push the hips forward as the upper body bends back.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This forward displacement of the hip is a defining characteristic. It creates a visually more extreme angle and a \"broken\" line at the hip, which is part of the specific Balanchine aesthetic. It allows for a different dynamic and visual effect compared to the pure spinal curve of the Vaganova method.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices based on the Analysis**\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic nuances in arm placement (*port de bras*) between the methods, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the mechanics of the *cambré* itself.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the primary and most significant point of divergence. Vaganova insists on still, square hips. Balanchine incorporates a forward press of the hips. This is a core technical and stylistic difference.\n    *   **C. Speed:** The tempo of a *cambré* can vary in any method depending on the exercise or choreography. It is not a fixed differentiator.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the bend is a result of a dancer's flexibility combined with the technique used. The Balanchine hip placement can create the illusion of a deeper bend, but the core difference is *how* that bend is achieved, which is through hip placement, not the resulting depth alone.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** Head placement is important in both, following the line of the movement to create a complete picture. However, the foundational difference that changes the entire structure of the pose is the action of the hips.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer**\n    *   The most distinct and well-known difference in the execution of a *cambré derrière* between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the use of the hips. Vaganova technique requires the hips to remain stable and aligned over the feet, while the Balanchine style features a characteristic forward push of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
