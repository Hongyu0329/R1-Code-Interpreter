    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\nLet the two polynomial matrices be:\nP1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nA polynomial matrix `G(s)` is a greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if:\n1.  `G(s)` is a common right divisor of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`. This means there exist polynomial matrices `A(s)` and `B(s)` such that `P1(s) = A(s)G(s)` and `P2(s) = B(s)G(s)`.\n2.  For any other common right divisor `D(s)`, `D(s)` must be a right divisor of `G(s)`. This means there exists a polynomial matrix `L(s)` such that `G(s) = L(s)D(s)`.\n\nA polynomial matrix is called **unimodular** if its determinant is a non-zero constant. Unimodular matrices are invertible over the ring of polynomials.\n\n**Step 2: Use the determinant property to constrain the GCRD**\n\nIf `G(s)` is a GCRD, it must satisfy `P2(s) = B(s)G(s)`. Taking the determinant of both sides gives:\n`det(P2(s)) = det(B(s)) * det(G(s))`\n\nLet's calculate the determinant of `P2(s)`:\n`det(P2(s)) = det([[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]) = (s)(1) - (0)(-s - 1) = s`\n\nSo, we have the relationship:\n`s = det(B(s)) * det(G(s))`\n\nSince `B(s)` and `G(s)` are polynomial matrices, their determinants must be polynomials in `s`. The degree of a product of polynomials is the sum of their degrees. Therefore:\n`deg(det(B(s))) + deg(det(G(s))) = deg(s) = 1`\n\nSince the degrees cannot be negative, there are two possibilities for `deg(det(G(s)))`:\n*   **Case 1:** `deg(det(G(s))) = 0`. This means `det(G(s))` is a non-zero constant, so `G(s)` is a unimodular matrix.\n*   **Case 2:** `deg(det(G(s))) = 1`. This means `deg(det(B(s))) = 0`, so `B(s)` must be a unimodular matrix.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Case 2**\n\nIn this case, `B(s)` is unimodular. From the equation `P2(s) = B(s)G(s)`, we can express `G(s)` as:\n`G(s) = B(s)^{-1} P2(s)`\nSince `B(s)` is unimodular, its inverse `B(s)^{-1}` is also a polynomial matrix. This means `G(s)` is a **right associate** of `P2(s)`.\n\nIf `G(s)` is a common right divisor, it must also be a right divisor of `P1(s)`. If a right associate of `P2(s)` is a right divisor of `P1(s)`, then `P2(s)` itself must be a right divisor of `P1(s)`.\n\nLet's check if `P2(s)` is a right divisor of `P1(s)` by performing the matrix division `P1(s) = Q(s)P2(s) + R(s)`. `P2(s)` is a right divisor only if the remainder `R(s)` is the zero matrix.\n\nWe look for a quotient matrix `Q(s)` such that the degree of `R(s)` is less than the degree of `P2(s)`. Let's choose `Q(s) = [[q11, q12], [q21, q22]]` to eliminate the highest degree terms in `P1(s)`.\nA suitable choice for the quotient is `Q(s) = [[0, -s], [s^2, s^2]]`.\n\nLet's compute `Q(s)P2(s)`:\n`Q(s)P2(s) = [[0, -s], [s^2, s^2]] * [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]`\n`= [[(-s)(-s-1), (-s)(1)], [s^2(s) + s^2(-s-1), s^2(1)]]`\n`= [[s^2 + s, -s], [s^3 - s^3 - s^2, s^2]]`\n`= [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2, s^2]]`\n\nNow, let's find the remainder `R(s) = P1(s) - Q(s)P2(s)`:\n`R(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] - [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2, s^2]]`\n`R(s) = [[0, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n\nSince the remainder `R(s)` is not the zero matrix, `P2(s)` is not a right divisor of `P1(s)`. This invalidates Case 2.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on Case 1**\n\nThe only possibility is Case 1, which states that any common right divisor `G(s)` must be unimodular.\n\nNow we need to find the GCRD. Let's test the simplest unimodular matrix: the identity matrix, `I = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n1.  **Is `I` a common right divisor?**\n    Yes, because `P1(s) = P1(s) * I` and `P2(s) = P2(s) * I`. This is a valid division with polynomial quotients.\n2.  **Is `I` the \"greatest\"?**\n    Let `D(s)` be any other common right divisor. From our analysis, `D(s)` must be unimodular. We need to check if `D(s)` is a right divisor of `I`. This means we need to find a polynomial matrix `L(s)` such that `I = L(s)D(s)`.\n    Solving for `L(s)` gives `L(s) = I * D(s)^{-1} = D(s)^{-1}`.\n    Since `D(s)` is unimodular, its inverse `D(s)^{-1}` is a polynomial matrix. Thus, the condition is satisfied.\n\nSince the identity matrix `I` is a common right divisor and any other common right divisor divides it, `I` is a greatest common right divisor of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`. When the GCRD is a unimodular matrix, the matrices are said to be right coprime.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is the identity matrix.\n\n```\n[[1, 0],\n [0, 1]]\n```\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
