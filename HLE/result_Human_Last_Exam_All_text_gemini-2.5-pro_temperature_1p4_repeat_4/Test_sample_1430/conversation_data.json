    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the objects and the question**\n\n*   We are given a complex algebraic curve `C` of genus `g = 3`.\n*   We consider the variety `X`, which is the 15th symmetric power of `C`, denoted as `C^(15)` or `Sym^15(C)`. `X` is the space of all effective divisors of degree 15 on `C`. `X` is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   We need to find the rank of the Néron-Severi group of `X`, denoted as `ρ(X)`. The Néron-Severi group `NS(X)` is the group of divisors on `X` modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank `ρ(X)` is also known as the Picard number of `X`.\n*   The curve `C` is not fixed. We need to find the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(X)` as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the geometry of X = C^(d) to the geometry of C**\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of algebraic curves states that for a curve `C` of genus `g`, its `d`-th symmetric power `C^(d)` has a special structure when `d` is large enough. Specifically, for `d >= 2g - 1`, the variety `C^(d)` is a projective bundle over the Jacobian variety `J(C)` of `C`.\n\nIn our case, `g = 3` and `d = 15`. The condition is `15 >= 2*3 - 1 = 5`. Since this condition is satisfied, `X = C^(15)` is a projective bundle over `J(C)`. The fiber of this bundle is a projective space `P^(d-g) = P^(15-3) = P^12`. Let the bundle map be `π: X -> J(C)`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Néron-Severi group of a projective bundle**\n\nFor a projective bundle `π: X -> A` over a variety `A`, the cohomology group `H^2(X, Q)` can be computed using the Leray-Serre spectral sequence. For a projective bundle `X = P(E)` over `A`, the result is particularly simple:\n`H^2(X, Q) ~= H^2(A, Q) ⊕ H^0(A, Q) ⋅ ζ`\nwhere `ζ` is the first Chern class of the tautological line bundle `O(1)` on the projective bundle `X`.\n\nTranslating this to our situation with `X = C^(15)` and `A = J(C)`:\n`H^2(C^(15), Q) ~= H^2(J(C), Q) ⊕ Q⋅ζ`\nThis means that any 2-cohomology class on `X` is a sum of a pullback of a class from the Jacobian and a multiple of the class `ζ`.\n\nThe class `ζ` is the cohomology class of a hyperplane section in the fibers, and it represents an algebraic divisor on `X`. Therefore, it contributes 1 to the rank of the Néron-Severi group.\n\nA pullback of a class from `J(C)`, `π*(α)` for `α ∈ H^2(J(C), Q)`, is an algebraic class on `X` if and only if `α` is an algebraic class on `J(C)`. The group of algebraic classes in `H^2(J(C), Q)` is precisely `NS(J(C)) ⊗ Q`.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of `X` is the sum of the ranks from these two independent sources:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible range for ρ(J(C))**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian `J(C)` of a genus 3 curve.\n\n*   `J(C)` is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g = 3`.\n*   The rank `ρ(J(C))` is always at least 1, as the principal polarization itself (the class of the theta divisor `Θ`) is an algebraic class.\n\n**Smallest possible rank for ρ(J(C))**:\nFor a \"very general\" curve `C` of genus 3, its Jacobian `J(C)` has the minimal possible endomorphism ring, `End(J(C)) = Z`. In this case, the Néron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` is generated solely by the class of the theta divisor. Thus, for a generic curve `C`:\n`ρ_min(J(C)) = 1`\n\n**Largest possible rank for ρ(J(C))**:\nThe rank `ρ(A)` of the Néron-Severi group of any complex projective variety `A` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^(1,1)(A)`.\nFor an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g`, its cohomology is given by the exterior algebra on `H^1(A)`. The Hodge numbers are well-known: `h^(p,q)(A) = binom(g,p) * binom(g,q)`.\nFor `A = J(C)`, `g=3`. The Hodge number `h^(1,1)(J(C))` is:\n`h^(1,1)(J(C)) = binom(3,1) * binom(3,1) = 3 * 3 = 9`.\nSo, `ρ(J(C)) <= 9`.\n\nThis maximum is achieved for special curves `C` whose Jacobians have Complex Multiplication (CM) and are of \"Hodge type\", meaning every Hodge (1,1)-class is algebraic. A classical example of such a curve is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`. It is a genus 3 curve, and its Jacobian `J(F_4)` is known to be isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with CM by `Z[i]`. For this Jacobian, it is a known result that `ρ(J(F_4)) = h^(1,1)(J(F_4)) = 9`.\n\nSo, the maximum possible rank is:\n`ρ_max(J(C)) = 9`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer for ρ(X)**\n\nUsing the formula `ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`, we can now find the smallest and largest possible ranks for `ρ(X)`.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:** `ρ_min(X) = ρ_min(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   **Largest Rank:** `ρ_max(X) = ρ_max(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
