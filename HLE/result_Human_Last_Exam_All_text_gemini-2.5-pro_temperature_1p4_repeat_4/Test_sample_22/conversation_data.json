    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** SNP heritability is a population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of the variation in a phenotype that is explained by the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically all common SNPs on a genotyping array. It's a theoretical upper bound or a \"ceiling\" on how much of the trait's variance can be predicted using a linear combination of these SNPs. This value assumes you know the *true* effect size of every single SNP.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS):** A polygenic score is a practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is constructed as a weighted sum of an individual's genotypes. Crucially, the weights used in this sum are not the *true* effect sizes (which are unknown). Instead, the weights are *estimated* from the data of a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n\n3.  **Define the Predictive Ability of a PGS:** The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by testing how well it correlates with the actual phenotype in a new, independent sample of individuals (one not used to create the weights). The most common metric is R², which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS.\n\n4.  **Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP)** is the *potential* variance explained, assuming perfect knowledge of all true SNP effects. It's the theoretical maximum.\n    *   **PGS Predictive Ability (R²_PGS)** is the *actual* variance explained by a predictor that uses *estimated* SNP effects from a finite sample.\n\n5.  **Identify Why PGS Predictive Ability is Lower:** The PGS is an imperfect predictor of the genetic component of a trait for several key reasons:\n    *   **Estimation Error:** GWASs are conducted on finite samples of people. This means that the effect size estimated for each SNP is not its true value but is subject to statistical noise or error. Using these noisy estimates as weights results in a suboptimal predictor.\n    *   **Limited Power:** A GWAS with a finite sample size will not be able to detect all the SNPs that have a real effect on the trait, especially those with very small effects. These SNPs are often left out of the PGS or their effects are estimated to be zero, further reducing the score's accuracy.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** Genes that are physically close on a chromosome are often inherited together (a phenomenon called LD). This makes it difficult for statistical methods to pinpoint the exact causal SNP, and the estimated effect for one SNP may actually be \"capturing\" the effects of other nearby SNPs, leading to suboptimal weights.\n    *   **Other factors:** Differences in ancestry or LD patterns between the GWAS sample and the prediction sample can also lower the predictive ability of the PGS.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBecause a polygenic score is built using imperfect, estimated weights from a finite dataset, it cannot capture the full extent of the genetic signal that theoretically exists. The SNP heritability represents this full theoretical signal. Therefore, the variance explained by a real-world polygenic score is necessarily a fraction of the total SNP heritability. The predictive ability of the PGS can approach the SNP heritability as the GWAS sample size increases towards infinity, but in any practical scenario, it will be lower.\n\nTrue.\n\n<<<True>>>"
