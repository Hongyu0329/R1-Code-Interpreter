    "**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ with conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is uniquely determined by a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nThe character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters is primitive.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters.\n\n**Step 2: Prime Factorization of the Conductor**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a character with conductor $N$. It can be written as a product:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nFor $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{q}$ (where $q \\in \\{4, 9, 7, 11, 13\\}$) must be a primitive character with conductor $q$.\n\n**Step 3: Finding Primitive Characters for Each Component**\n\nLet $d_q = \\text{order}(\\chi_q)$. The order of the combined character $\\chi$ is $\\text{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$. We require this lcm to be 6.\nThis imposes two conditions:\n1.  For each component $q$, its order $d_q$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}\\}$ must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\nLet's find the number of choices for each primitive component character $\\chi_q$ such that its order $d_q$ divides 6.\n\n*   **For $q=4=2^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is $\\phi(4) - \\phi(2) = 2 - 1 = 1$ primitive character. Its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\n    - Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1. The order is $d_4=2$.\n\n*   **For $q=9=3^2$**:\n    The character group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$.\n    The orders of elements in $C_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 6. The characters induced from mod 3 correspond to the subgroup of order $\\phi(3)=2$, whose elements have orders 1 and 2.\n    Thus, the primitive characters mod 9 must have orders 3 or 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    Both 3 and 6 divide 6, so all 4 primitive characters are valid choices.\n    - Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$. The order is $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n\n*   **For $q=7$**:\n    The character group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The primitive characters are all the non-principal ones, numbering $\\phi(7)-1=5$. Their orders are the divisors of 6 other than 1, i.e., 2, 3, and 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    All these orders divide 6, so all $1+2+2=5$ primitive characters are valid choices.\n    - Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5. The order is $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n*   **For $q=11$**:\n    The character group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The primitive characters have orders that divide 10 and are greater than 1, i.e., 2, 5, 10.\n    We need the order to divide 6. Out of {2, 5, 10}, only 2 divides 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1. The order is $d_{11}=2$.\n\n*   **For $q=13$**:\n    The character group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The primitive characters have orders that divide 12 and are greater than 1, i.e., 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n    We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are {2, 3, 6}.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of valid choices is $1+2+2=5$.\n    - Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5. The order is $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Combining the Components**\n\nWe need to choose one valid character for each component and form the product character $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$. The total number of ways to do this is:\nNumber of combinations = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber of combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that the order of the resulting character is exactly 6 for every one of these 100 combinations. The order is $L = \\text{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$.\n-   Since every component character's order $d_q$ divides 6, their lcm, $L$, must also divide 6.\n-   To show $L=6$, we need to show that $L$ is a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n    -   Is $L$ a multiple of 2? The choice for $\\chi_4$ is fixed, and its order is $d_4=2$. Since $d_4$ is one of the arguments of the lcm, $L$ must be a multiple of 2.\n    -   Is $L$ a multiple of 3? For any of the 4 choices for $\\chi_9$, its order $d_9$ is either 3 or 6. In both cases, $d_9$ is a multiple of 3. Since $d_9$ is one of the arguments of the lcm, $L$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince $L$ is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nWe have shown that $L$ divides 6 and is a multiple of 6. Therefore, for every one of the 100 possible combinations, the order is exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is the total number of valid combinations we calculated.\n\nFinal Answer = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
