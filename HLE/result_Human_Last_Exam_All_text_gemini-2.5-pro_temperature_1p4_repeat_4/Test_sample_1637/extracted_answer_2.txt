Yes, changing the amide group to a PEG group is a well-established and effective strategy to increase the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic molecules and will very likely solve the precipitation problem. The PEG group increases hydrophilicity and sterically hinders the intermolecular aggregation that causes the probe to precipitate from the medium.
