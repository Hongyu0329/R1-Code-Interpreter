    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change $x'(t)$ is zero. We set the right-hand side of the equation to zero:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can factor the expression:\nFirst, factor out $-x$:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe quadratic term in the parentheses is a perfect square:\n$x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\n\nThe roots of this equation are the equilibrium points:\n$x = 0$\n$x = 1$\n\nThere are two equilibrium points: $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of the equilibrium points**\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can analyze the sign of the derivative of the function $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$ at that point.\nLet's find the derivative, $f'(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x)$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ for each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method, such as a phase line analysis (sign analysis of $f(x)$) or the second derivative test.\n\n    Let's analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n    *   For $x > 1$ (e.g., $x=2$): $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2 < 0$. This means $x'(t)$ is negative, so solutions starting above 1 will move downwards, towards 1.\n    *   For $x < 1$ (e.g., $x=0.5$): $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.125 < 0$. This means $x'(t)$ is negative, so solutions starting just below 1 will move downwards, away from 1.\n\n    Since solutions starting from one side of $x=1$ (for $x<1$) move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium, which is a type of unstable equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of stable equilibrium points**\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nThe problem states that $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points.\nTherefore, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expression**\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m = 1$ into the expression:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$"
