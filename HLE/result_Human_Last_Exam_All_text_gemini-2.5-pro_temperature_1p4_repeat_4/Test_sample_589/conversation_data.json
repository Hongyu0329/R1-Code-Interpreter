    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key elements.**\nThe question asks for a specific Hollywood feature film with the following distinct characteristics:\n*   **Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n*   **Production:** Produced by a major film studio (e.g., Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount, Disney, Sony).\n*   **Character:** A teenager.\n*   **Prop:** The teenager rides a pink bike. This is a very specific visual detail.\n*   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car. This is a specific, dramatic, and likely dangerous action.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm potential films based on keywords.**\nThinking about movies with teenagers and bikes might bring to mind films like *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*, or *Napoleon Dynamite*. Let's analyze them.\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** Features kids on bikes, but Elliott's iconic bike is red, not pink. The famous scene involves flying over the police cars, not pedaling directly toward them in a confrontation. So, this is incorrect.\n*   ***The Goonies* (1985):** Features a teenager (Brand) on a bike, but it's a small children's bike with training wheels, and it's not pink. No scene matches the described action. This is incorrect.\n*   ***Pretty in Pink* (1986):** The title and theme are pink, and the main characters are teenagers. However, the iconic vehicle is Andie's pinkish Volkswagen Karmann Ghia, not a bike. This is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Refine the search by focusing on the specific action.**\nPedaling directly toward an oncoming car is a dramatic act of desperation, defiance, or horror. This suggests the scene might be from a drama or a horror film. The combination of a *pink* bike (often associated with youth and innocence) and this dark action creates a powerful contrast, which is a common trope in the horror genre.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze potential horror films.**\nLet's consider the modern \"It\" film series, which heavily features teenagers on bikes.\n*   ***It* (2017):** The \"Losers' Club\" are all young teens who ride bikes, but none of their main bikes are pink. Bill's is famously \"Silver.\" While there are many frightening encounters, the specific scene described is not in this film.\n*   ***It Chapter Two* (2019):** This film is produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, both major players, so it fits the studio criterion. The film features flashbacks to the Losers' Club as young teens, as well as new scenes set in the past.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the specific scene in the candidate film.**\n*   In ***It Chapter Two***, there is a flashback scene near the beginning of the film.\n*   A teenage girl named Victoria \"Vicky\" Fuller is at a local baseball game.\n*   Pennywise taunts her from under the bleachers, preying on her insecurities about a birthmark on her face.\n*   Terrified and distraught, Vicky gets on her distinctly **pink bicycle** to flee.\n*   As she pedals frantically into the street, she pedals directly into the path of a large, **oncoming truck** (a type of car/vehicle). She is frozen in terror, looking directly at it before Pennywise pulls her into a storm drain.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis scene from *It Chapter Two* perfectly matches every element from the question: it is a Hollywood feature film from a major studio (Warner Bros./New Line), it features a teenager (Victoria), she is riding a pink bike, and she pedals directly toward an oncoming vehicle (a truck).\n\n<<<It Chapter Two>>>"
