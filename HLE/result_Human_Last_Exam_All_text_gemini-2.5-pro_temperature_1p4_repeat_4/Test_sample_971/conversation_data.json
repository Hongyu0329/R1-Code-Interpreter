    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a very specific piece of information:\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Role:** Kitri\n*   **Act:** Act I\n*   **Scene:** The variation (solo dance)\n*   **Specific Step:** single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Choreography of Kitri's Act I Variation**\nKitri's variation in Act I of *Don Quixote*, in the standard Marius Petipa/Alexander Gorsky choreography used by the Bolshoi Ballet, is one of the most famous and recognizable solos in the classical repertoire. Its key features include high jumps, sharp footwork, the famous sequence with the fan (*grand rond de jambe en l'air*), and a concluding diagonal of turns.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Specific Turning Step in the Variation**\nThis is the most critical point in answering the question. The famous diagonal of turns that Kitri performs in her Act I variation is a series of **piqué turns**.\n\n*   **Piqué Turn:** A traveling turn where the dancer steps directly onto the pointe or demi-pointe of the working leg, with the other foot quickly brought up to a retiré position. The dancer then turns on that supporting leg.\n*   **Pirouette en dehors from the fifth position:** A stationary turn where the dancer begins in fifth position, executes a plié, and then pushes off from both feet to relevé onto one leg, turning outwards (en dehors).\n\nThese are two technically distinct ballet steps.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Choreography for the Specific Step Mentioned**\nA careful review of Natalia Osipova's performances of this role with the Bolshoi Ballet during that period (including the famous 2011 recording, which uses the same choreography) confirms that she, like all other ballerinas performing the standard version, executes a diagonal of piqué turns. The choreography for this specific variation does not contain a sequence of single-turn pirouettes en dehors starting from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\nSince the ballet step specified in the question — \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" — is not a part of the established choreography for Kitri's Act I variation in the Bolshoi's production of *Don Quixote*, the number of times Natalia Osipova performed this specific step in that variation is zero.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation is 0, as the choreography for that specific solo features a diagonal of piqué turns, not pirouettes from the fifth position.\n\n<<<0>>>"
