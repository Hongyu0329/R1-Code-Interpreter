    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the definitions from combinatorial algebraic topology, specifically concerning higher-dimensional forests and simplicial collapses.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Objects:**\n    *   **Standard Triangulation of the Möbius Band (K):** This is a simplicial complex, let's call it $K$, that represents the Möbius band. While several triangulations exist, the specific choice doesn't affect the final topological argument. A key property is that $K$ can be embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$).\n    *   **Higher Dimensional Forest (F):** In this context, a subcomplex $F \\subseteq K$ is called a \"forest\" if each of its path-connected components is a \"tree\". A higher-dimensional \"tree\" is a contractible subcomplex. Contractibility means that the subcomplex can be continuously shrunk to a single point.\n    *   **Root (R):** The root $R$ is specified as a subcomplex of the forest $F$.\n    *   **Rooted Forest ((F,R)):** This is a pair consisting of a forest $F$ and a root $R \\subseteq F$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Condition: \"F fails to simplicially collapse onto R\" ($F \\not\\searrow R$)**\n    *   **Simplicial Collapse:** A simplicial complex $C$ collapses to a subcomplex $L$ (written $C \\searrow L$) if $L$ can be obtained from $C$ through a sequence of elementary collapses. An elementary collapse removes a maximal face and one of its free faces.\n    *   **Homotopy Invariance:** Simplicial collapse is a strong form of homotopy equivalence. If $C \\searrow L$, then $C$ and $L$ are homotopy equivalent ($C \\simeq L$). This means they have the same homology groups, homotopy groups, etc.\n    *   **Failure to Collapse:** The question asks for the number of pairs $(F, R)$ where $F$ is a forest, but $F \\not\\searrow R$.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Concepts:**\n    *   Let's analyze when a collapse $F \\searrow R$ is possible or impossible for a rooted forest $(F, R)$.\n    *   $F \\searrow R$ if and only if each connected component of $F$ collapses to its intersection with $R$. Let $C$ be a connected component of $F$, and let $R_C = R \\cap C$. The condition is that $C \\searrow R_C$ for all components $C$.\n    *   By definition, since $F$ is a forest, its component $C$ must be contractible.\n    *   Since the Möbius band can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so can any of its subcomplexes like $C$. A key theorem in topology states that any contractible 2-dimensional simplicial complex that can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is in fact **collapsible**. So, $C$ is a collapsible complex.\n    *   Now we consider the condition $C \\searrow R_C$.\n        *   If $C \\searrow R_C$, then $C \\simeq R_C$. Since $C$ is contractible, $R_C$ must also be contractible. By the same logic as for $C$, since $R_C$ is a subcomplex of $K$, it is embeddable in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and thus must be collapsible.\n        *   Conversely, there is a theorem in combinatorial topology (true for complexes of dimension $\\le 2$) which states that if $C$ is a collapsible complex and $L \\subseteq C$ is a collapsible subcomplex, then $C$ simplicially collapses to $L$ ($C \\searrow L$).\n    *   Combining these points: for a component $C$ of $F$, the collapse $C \\searrow R_C$ happens if and only if $R_C$ is a collapsible subcomplex.\n\n4.  **Characterizing \"Bad\" Pairs:**\n    *   A pair $(F,R)$ fails to have $F \\searrow R$ if, for at least one component $C$ of $F$, the corresponding root part $R_C$ is not collapsible.\n    *   A subcomplex is collapsible if and only if all its connected components are collapsible. In our context, this is equivalent to being contractible.\n    *   So, $R_C$ is not collapsible if and only if it's not a \"forest\" in its own right (i.e., at least one of its components is not contractible).\n    *   Therefore, the pairs $(F,R)$ that fail the collapse condition are precisely those where **$F$ is a forest, but the root subcomplex $R$ is not a forest**. An example would be taking a single triangle $\\sigma$ from the triangulation for $F$, and its boundary cycle $\\partial\\sigma$ for $R$. $F=\\sigma$ is contractible (a tree), but $R=\\partial\\sigma$ is not (it's a circle). So $F$ cannot collapse to $R$.\n\n5.  **Revisiting the Definition of \"Rooted Forest\":**\n    *   The problem now seems to be a very complex counting problem: count all pairs $(F,R)$ where $F$ is a forest and $R \\subseteq F$ is not.\n    *   However, the term \"rooted forest\" often carries a more specific definition in the literature. A common definition of a rooted forest $(F,R)$ requires the root $R$ to be a set of vertices, with exactly one vertex chosen from each connected component of the forest $F$. This is a direct generalization of a rooted forest in graph theory.\n    *   Let's analyze the question under this standard definition.\n        *   $F$ is a forest, so its components $C_i$ are contractible (and thus collapsible).\n        *   $R = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots\\}$ is a set of vertices, where $v_i$ is a vertex in $C_i$.\n        *   A single vertex is a contractible (and collapsible) complex.\n        *   According to the theorem used in Step 3, a collapsible complex $C_i$ collapses to any of its collapsible subcomplexes. Since the root vertex $v_i$ is a collapsible subcomplex of $C_i$, we must have $C_i \\searrow v_i$.\n        *   This holds for every component. Therefore, the entire forest $F$ must simplicially collapse onto the root $R$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   If we adopt the standard definition of a \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" where the root is a set of vertices (one per component), then the property of the forest collapsing onto the root is always satisfied.\n    *   Therefore, the number of such rooted forests that *fail* to have this property is zero. The question is likely a test of understanding the definitions and their immediate consequences.\n\nThe phrasing of the question, which posits the existence of such failing objects, might be interpreted as a hint against this conclusion. However, without a different, explicitly stated definition of \"rooted forest\" that allows for non-collapsing pairs, the most logical conclusion based on standard mathematical terminology is that no such objects exist."
