    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of the given set and its ordering to determine the corresponding ordinal number, known as the order type.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Set and Ordering**\n*   The set, let's call it $S$, is the set of all finite, non-empty strings of characters from the alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$. This set is often denoted as $\\Sigma^+$.\n*   The ordering is lexical (lexicographical) order. For two strings $u$ and $v$, $u < v$ if either:\n    1.  $u$ is a proper prefix of $v$ (e.g., `a` < `aa`).\n    2.  At the first position where $u$ and $v$ differ, the character in $u$ is smaller than the character in $v$ (e.g., `ab` < `ac`).\n*   The alphabet has a natural order: $a < b < c < d$.\n*   The set $S$ is countably infinite and the lexical order is a well-ordering, so its order type will be a countable ordinal.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Set Based on the Lexical Order**\nThe most natural way to decompose the set $S$ according to the lexical order is by the first character of the strings.\nLet $S_x$ be the subset of strings in $S$ that start with the character $x$. We can partition $S$ as:\n$S = S_a \\cup S_b \\cup S_c \\cup S_d$\nAccording to the rules of lexical order, any string starting with `a` is less than any string starting with `b`, and so on. This means the set $S$ is an ordered sum of these four blocks.\nLet $L$ be the order type of $S$. Let $T_x$ be the order type of $S_x$. Then:\n$L = T_a + T_b + T_c + T_d$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Order Type of the Subsets**\nLet's analyze the structure of a subset, for example, $S_a$.\n$S_a = \\{as' \\mid s' \\text{ is a finite string over } \\{a,b,c,d\\}\\}$\nThe set of all finite strings (including the empty string, $\\epsilon$) is denoted by $\\Sigma^*$. So, $S_a = \\{as' \\mid s' \\in \\Sigma^*\\}$.\n\nConsider the mapping $f: \\Sigma^* \\to S_a$ defined by $f(s') = as'$. This mapping is a bijection. Let's check if it preserves the order.\nLet $s'_1, s'_2 \\in \\Sigma^*$. If $s'_1 < s'_2$ in lexical order, then by the definition of lexical order, $as'_1 < as'_2$. This means the mapping $f$ is an order isomorphism.\nTherefore, the order type of $S_a$, which is $T_a$, is the same as the order type of $\\Sigma^*$.\n$T_a = \\text{type}(\\Sigma^*)$\nBy symmetry, the same applies to $S_b, S_c, S_d$.\n$T_a = T_b = T_c = T_d = \\text{type}(\\Sigma^*)$.\n\nLet's denote the order type of $\\Sigma^*$ by $\\Omega$.\nThen, $L = \\Omega + \\Omega + \\Omega + \\Omega = \\Omega \\cdot 4$.\n\n**Step 4: Establish a Recursive Relation for the Order Type**\nNow we need to find $\\Omega$. The set $\\Sigma^*$ is composed of the empty string $\\epsilon$ and all the non-empty strings, which form the set $S$.\n$\\Sigma^* = \\{\\epsilon\\} \\cup S$\nIn the lexical order, the empty string $\\epsilon$ is typically considered the smallest element (as it's a prefix of every other string).\nSo, the ordered set $\\Sigma^*$ consists of one minimal element followed by the ordered set $S$.\nIn terms of ordinal sums, this means:\n$\\Omega = 1 + L$\n\n**Step 5: Solve the Ordinal Equation**\nWe have a system of two equations for the ordinals $L$ and $\\Omega$:\n1.  $L = \\Omega \\cdot 4$\n2.  $\\Omega = 1 + L$\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n$\\Omega = 1 + (\\Omega \\cdot 4)$\n\nWe need to solve this equation for the ordinal $\\Omega$.\nThe set $\\Sigma^*$ is infinite and has no largest element (for any string $s$, the string $sa$ is larger). This means $\\Omega$ must be an infinite limit ordinal.\nFor any ordinal $\\alpha \\ge \\omega$, we have $1 + \\alpha = \\alpha$.\nSince $\\Omega$ is an infinite ordinal, so is $\\Omega \\cdot 4$. Therefore, $\\Omega \\cdot 4$ is a limit ordinal.\nThis means $1 + (\\Omega \\cdot 4) = \\Omega \\cdot 4$.\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n$\\Omega = \\Omega \\cdot 4$\n\nThis equation is satisfied by $\\Omega = 0$, but the order type is clearly not zero. It is also satisfied by certain infinite ordinals. For an ordinal $\\alpha$ and a finite number $k>1$, the equation $\\alpha = \\alpha \\cdot k$ holds if $\\alpha$ is of the form $\\omega^\\gamma$ where $\\gamma$ is a limit ordinal (or more generally, if the Cantor Normal Form of $\\alpha$ starts with $\\omega^\\beta$ where $\\beta$ is a limit ordinal).\n\nThe smallest non-zero ordinal solution to $\\alpha = \\alpha \\cdot k$ (for $k \\ge 2$) is $\\omega^\\omega$.\nLet's verify this:\n$\\omega^\\omega \\cdot 4 = (\\sup_{n<\\omega} \\omega^n) \\cdot 4 = \\sup_{n<\\omega} (\\omega^n \\cdot 4)$.\nSince for any finite $n$, $\\omega^n \\cdot 4 < \\omega^{n+1}$, the supremum of this sequence is $\\sup_{n<\\omega} \\omega^n = \\omega^\\omega$.\nSo, $\\Omega = \\omega^\\omega$ is indeed a solution.\n\nSince the order type must be the smallest possible ordinal that satisfies the structural properties of the set, we can conclude that $\\Omega = \\omega^\\omega$.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the order type of the set of *finite strings*, which is $S = \\Sigma^+$. We denoted this order type by $L$.\nWe have the relations:\n$\\Omega = \\omega^\\omega$\n$\\Omega = 1 + L$\n\nSo, $\\omega^\\omega = 1 + L$.\nSince $\\omega^\\omega$ is a limit ordinal, this implies $L = \\omega^\\omega$.\n(If $\\lambda$ is a limit ordinal, the unique solution to $1+x=\\lambda$ is $x=\\lambda$).\n\nThus, the order type of the set of finite strings of characters $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ ordered lexically is $\\omega^\\omega$."
