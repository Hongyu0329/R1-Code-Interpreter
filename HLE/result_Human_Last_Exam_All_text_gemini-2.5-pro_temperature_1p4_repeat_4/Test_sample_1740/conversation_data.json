    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** The `let-7` family of microRNAs (miRNAs).\n    *   **Organism:** Humans (`Homo sapiens`).\n    *   **Question:** The total number of unique `members` identified \"to date\".\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **What defines a \"member\"?** This is the most critical point. The term \"member\" can be interpreted in two main ways for miRNA families:\n        *   **A) Unique mature miRNA sequence:** This refers to the final, functional small RNA molecule. For example, `let-7a`, `let-7b`, etc., are considered distinct members because their mature sequences differ slightly (though they share a common \"seed\" sequence that defines the family).\n        *   **B) Unique precursor miRNA gene:** This refers to the gene locus in the DNA that codes for the miRNA. Sometimes, multiple different genes (paralogs) can produce the exact same mature miRNA. For example, three different genes (`let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`) all produce the mature `let-7a`.\n    *   **Which interpretation is standard?** In bioinformatics and molecular biology, when asked about the number of \"members\" in a family like let-7, the standard interpretation refers to the number of unique mature miRNAs (Interpretation A). This is because they represent the functionally distinct entities.\n    *   **What is the authoritative source?** The primary and most reliable database for microRNA sequences and nomenclature is miRBase. The analysis should be based on the information it contains.\n\n3.  **Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1: Consult the Authoritative Source.** We will refer to the data in miRBase (the official miRNA registry) to identify all human (`hsa`) miRNAs belonging to the let-7 family.\n    *   **Step 2: List the Canonical let-7 Members.** The let-7 family is named with letter suffixes. In humans, the following have been identified:\n        *   `let-7a`\n        *   `let-7b`\n        *   `let-7c`\n        *   `let-7d`\n        *   `let-7e`\n        *   `let-7f`\n        *   `let-7g`\n        *   `let-7i`\n        *   *(Note: There is no `let-7h` identified in humans, though it exists in other species).*\n    *   **Step 3: Identify Other Closely Related Members.** Due to high sequence similarity and sharing the same functional seed sequence, another miRNA is universally considered part of the let-7 family:\n        *   `miR-98`\n    *   **Step 4: Count the Unique Members.** Counting the distinct members from the lists in Step 2 and Step 3 gives us the total number.\n        *   `let-7a` (1)\n        *   `let-7b` (2)\n        *   `let-7c` (3)\n        *   `let-7d` (4)\n        *   `let-7e` (5)\n        *   `let-7f` (6)\n        *   `let-7g` (7)\n        *   `let-7i` (8)\n        *   `miR-98` (9)\n    *   **Step 5: Final Conclusion.** Based on the standard convention of counting unique mature miRNA sequences as \"members\", there are **9** members in the human let-7 family. For context, these 9 members are encoded by a total of 12 different genes.\n\nTo summarize, the count of 9 refers to the number of distinct mature miRNAs (let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98), which is the standard answer to this question.\n\n<<<9>>>"
