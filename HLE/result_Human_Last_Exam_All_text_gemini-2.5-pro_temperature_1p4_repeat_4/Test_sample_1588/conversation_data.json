    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n    The BCH formula provides an expression for `Z` in `e^Z = e^X e^Y`, where `X` and `Y` are non-commuting operators. The expansion is given by:\n    `Z = log(e^X e^Y) = X + Y + Z_2 + Z_3 + ... + Z_n + ...`\n    Each term `Z_n` is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree `n`. This means it is a linear combination of nested commutators involving `n` operators (a mix of `X`s and `Y`s). For example:\n    `Z_2 = 1/2 [X, Y]`\n    `Z_3 = 1/12 [X, [X, Y]] - 1/12 [Y, [X, Y]]`\n\n2.  **Relating Coefficients to the Free Lie Algebra**\n    The question asks for the \"number of non-zero coefficients of order 10\". This is equivalent to finding the number of linearly independent terms of degree 10 in the BCH expansion. These terms form a basis for the 10th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, `L(X, Y)`. It is a known result that the coefficients for all basis elements in the BCH formula are non-zero. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the dimension of this component, denoted as `dim(L_10(2))`.\n\n3.  **Using Witt's Formula**\n    The dimension of the `n`-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on `k` generators is given by Witt's formula:\n    `dim(L_n(k)) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the degree (or order) of the terms.\n    *   `k` is the number of generators.\n    *   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n    *   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n4.  **Applying Witt's Formula to the Problem**\n    For this specific question:\n    *   The order is `n = 10`.\n    *   The generators are `X` and `Y`, so `k = 2`.\n\n    We need to calculate `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * Σ_{d|10} μ(d) * 2^(10/d)`.\n\n### Careful Points and Calculation\n\n1.  **Find the divisors of n = 10:**\n    The divisors `d` of 10 are {1, 2, 5, 10}.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor:**\n    The Möbius function is defined as:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`.\n    *   `μ(d) = (-1)^r` if `d` is a product of `r` distinct primes.\n    *   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n\n    For our divisors:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2 * 5) = (-1)^2 = 1` (10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n\n3.  **Substitute the values into Witt's formula:**\n    The formula expands as follows:\n    `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [μ(1) * 2^(10/1) + μ(2) * 2^(10/2) + μ(5) * 2^(10/5) + μ(10) * 2^(10/10)]`\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   Plug in the values for `μ(d)`:\n        `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [ (1) * 2^10 + (-1) * 2^5 + (-1) * 2^2 + (1) * 2^1 ]`\n    *   Calculate the powers of 2:\n        *   `2^10 = 1024`\n        *   `2^5 = 32`\n        *   `2^2 = 4`\n        *   `2^1 = 2`\n    *   Substitute these results back into the equation:\n        `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [1 * 1024 - 1 * 32 - 1 * 4 + 1 * 2]`\n    *   Simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n        `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]`\n        `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [992 - 4 + 2]`\n        `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [988 + 2]`\n        `dim(L_10(2)) = (1/10) * [990]`\n    *   Calculate the final result:\n        `dim(L_10(2)) = 99`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the 10th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, which is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
