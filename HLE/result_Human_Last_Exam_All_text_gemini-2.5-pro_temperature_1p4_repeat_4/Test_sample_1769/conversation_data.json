    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the starting point - the word for \"sister\" in Old English.\n\nThe native Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for \"sister\" was ***sweostor***. A common variant of this word, which arose from the loss of an unstressed vowel, was ***swuster***. This word, like many in Old English, came from a common Proto-Germanic root, *\\*swestēr*.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Norse word and its influence.\n\nThe invaders from Scandinavia spoke Old Norse. Their word for \"sister\" was ***systir***. This word is a **cognate** of the Old English word, meaning they both evolved from the same Proto-Germanic root (*\\*swestēr*). They are linguistic cousins, not a completely foreign word.\n\nWhen the Norse settled in England, their word *systir* began to compete with and influence the native *sweostor*/*swuster*. The key points of influence are:\n1.  **The Vowel:** The modern word \"sister\" uses the \"i\" vowel sound (/ɪ/), which clearly derives from the Old Norse *systir*, not the \"eo\" or \"u\" vowel of the Old English *sweostor*/*swuster*.\n2.  **The Consonant Sound:** Old English often palatalized the \"sk\" sound into \"sh\" (e.g., Old English *scip* became \"ship\"). Old Norse kept the hard \"sk\" sound. While this particular word doesn't have \"sk\", the influence of the hard /s/ sound in *systir* reinforced its pronunciation in English, preventing any potential sound changes.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is therefore a direct result of this interaction; the Old Norse form proved more influential and largely replaced the native English form, although the native form survived as *suster* in some dialects for a long time.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the evolution of the Old English word without Norse influence.\n\nTo figure out what the word would have become, we must trace the likely evolution of the purely native word, *sweostor* or *swuster*, following the known sound changes in English.\n1.  The form *swuster* would likely have become the standard base, as dropping unstressed vowels was a common process.\n2.  In Middle English, this would have become ***suster*** (pronounced roughly \"soos-ter\"). This form is well-attested in Middle English texts, showing it coexisted with the Norse-influenced *sister*.\n3.  Between Middle English and Modern English, a key sound change occurred where the vowel /u/ (as in \"put\") often shifted to /ʌ/ (the \"uh\" sound in \"cup\"). We can see this in many other words that evolved from Old English:\n    *   Old English *sunu* -> Middle English *sone* -> Modern English \"son\" (/sʌn/)\n    *   Old English *lufu* -> Middle English *love* -> Modern English \"love\" (/lʌv/)\n4.  Applying this same sound change to Middle English *suster* would result in a Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsʌstər/.\n\n### Step 4: Check for confirmation in related languages.\n\nWe can check our hypothesis by looking at the word for \"sister\" in other West Germanic languages that were not subject to the same Old Norse influence.\n*   **Dutch:** *zuster*\n*   **Frisian (the closest language to English):** *suster*\n*   **German:** *Schwester*\n\nThese related languages all preserve a form very similar to the hypothesized English word, strongly supporting the conclusion that without Norse influence, the English word would be derived from *swuster*.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English *sweostor*/*swuster* would have followed its own evolutionary path. Based on the development of similar words and the forms found in closely related languages, it would have become the Modern English word **suster**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
