    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Conceptual Framework: Large Deviations and Statistical Mechanics**\n\nThe question asks us to use the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems. In the context of statistical mechanics, this framework provides a rigorous foundation for the \"principle of maximum entropy.\"\n\n*   **Boltzmann's Principle & Entropy:** The equilibrium state of an isolated system is the macrostate that corresponds to the largest number of possible microstates ($\\Omega$). The entropy is defined as $S = k_B \\log \\Omega$.\n*   **Large Deviation Connection:** The probability of observing any macrostate other than the equilibrium one is exceedingly small for a large system. Large deviation theory formalizes this by stating that the probability of observing a \"non-typical\" configuration (e.g., a distribution of particles different from the equilibrium one) decreases exponentially with the size of the system ($N$). The rate of this decay is given by a \"rate function.\" Maximizing entropy is equivalent to finding the distribution that minimizes this rate function, which is the \"most probable\" or \"least rare\" state.\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem provides the rate function for the empirical distribution of a sequence of random variables. In our case, it provides the justification for using an entropy functional to find the most probable distribution of particles among energy levels. For Bose-Einstein statistics, this functional is not the simple Shannon entropy but a specific form derived from boson combinatorics.\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with the large deviations of the sample mean. Its machinery, involving Lagrange multipliers and Legendre-Fenchel transforms, is precisely what we use to solve the constrained optimization problem: maximizing entropy subject to a fixed mean energy.\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **System:** We are analyzing a gas of light quanta (photons).\n*   **Statistics:** Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics. This means any number of identical, indistinguishable photons can occupy the same energy state.\n*   **Particle Number:** A crucial property of a photon gas (like in black-body radiation) is that the total number of photons is not conserved. Photons can be created and annihilated. In the language of statistical mechanics, this means the chemical potential $\\mu$ is zero.\n*   **Constraints:** The only constraint on the system at equilibrium is that the total (or mean) energy is a fixed value, $E$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n**Step A: Define the Entropy for a Bose-Einstein System**\n\nWe start by finding the number of ways to arrange the particles, which gives us the entropy.\nConsider a set of discrete energy levels $\\{\\epsilon_j\\}$. Let each level $\\epsilon_j$ consist of $g_j$ degenerate quantum states. We want to distribute $n_j$ indistinguishable photons into these $g_j$ states. From combinatorics (the \"stars and bars\" problem), the number of ways to do this is:\n$\\Omega_j = \\binom{n_j + g_j - 1}{n_j}$\n\nThe total number of microstates for a given distribution $\\{n_j\\}$ across all energy levels is the product over all levels:\n$\\Omega = \\prod_j \\Omega_j = \\prod_j \\binom{n_j + g_j - 1}{n_j}$\n\nThe entropy is $S = k_B \\log \\Omega$. Assuming $n_j$ and $g_j$ are large, we use Stirling's approximation ($\\log(x!) \\approx x \\log x - x$):\n$S = k_B \\sum_j \\log \\Omega_j = k_B \\sum_j \\log \\left( \\frac{(n_j+g_j-1)!}{n_j! (g_j-1)!} \\right)$\n$S \\approx k_B \\sum_j [ (n_j+g_j)\\log(n_j+g_j) - n_j\\log n_j - g_j\\log g_j ]$\nThis expression for entropy is the quantity we need to maximize. It serves as the negative of the rate function in the LDT framework for bosons.\n\n**Step B: Maximize Entropy with Constraints**\n\nThe equilibrium distribution $\\{\\bar{n}_j\\}$ is the one that maximizes $S$ subject to the constraint of fixed total energy $E$:\nConstraint: $\\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j = E$\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left( \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j - E \\right)$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint (it will later be identified as $1/k_B T$).\n\nTo find the maximum, we set the partial derivative of $\\mathcal{L}$ with respect to each $n_j$ to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_j} [ (n_j+g_j)\\log(n_j+g_j) - n_j\\log n_j - g_j\\log g_j ] - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n\nThe derivative of the entropy term is:\n$\\frac{d}{dn} [(n+g)\\log(n+g) - n\\log n] = [\\log(n+g) + 1] - [\\log n + 1] = \\log\\left(\\frac{n+g}{n}\\right)$\n\nSo, the condition for equilibrium is:\n$\\log\\left(\\frac{n_j+g_j}{n_j}\\right) - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n$\\log\\left(1 + \\frac{g_j}{n_j}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n$1 + \\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n$\\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1$\n\nSolving for the average occupation number $\\bar{n}_j$ for level $j$ gives the famous **Bose-Einstein distribution**:\n$\\bar{n}_j = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nThe average number of particles per state is $\\frac{\\bar{n}_j}{g_j} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$.\n\n**Step C: Find the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy is the value $\\langle E \\rangle = E$ determined by the distribution we just found. We obtain its expression by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers $\\bar{n}_j$ back into the energy constraint equation:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_j \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j = \\sum_j \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nThis expression gives the equilibrium energy of the photon gas as a function of the parameter $\\beta$ (which is related to temperature by $\\beta=1/k_B T$).\n\n**Step D: Find the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nTo find the equilibrium entropy, we substitute the equilibrium values $\\bar{n}_j$ back into the entropy formula from Step A.\n$S = k_B \\sum_j [ (\\bar{n}_j+g_j)\\log(\\bar{n}_j+g_j) - \\bar{n}_j\\log\\bar{n}_j - g_j\\log g_j ]$\n\nWe can simplify this by using the equilibrium condition $\\log\\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}_j+g_j}{\\bar{n}_j}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$.\nLet's rewrite the entropy sum:\n$S/k_B = \\sum_j \\left[ \\bar{n}_j \\log\\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}_j+g_j}{\\bar{n}_j}\\right) + g_j \\log\\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}_j+g_j}{g_j}\\right) \\right]$\n$S/k_B = \\sum_j \\left[ \\bar{n}_j (\\beta \\epsilon_j) + g_j \\log\\left(1 + \\frac{\\bar{n}_j}{g_j}\\right) \\right]$\n$S/k_B = \\beta \\sum_j \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j + \\sum_j g_j \\log\\left(1 + \\frac{\\bar{n}_j}{g_j}\\right)$\n\nThe first term is $\\beta \\langle E \\rangle$. For the second term, we use our result for $\\bar{n}_j/g_j$:\n$1 + \\frac{\\bar{n}_j}{g_j} = 1 + \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} = \\frac{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}}$\n\nSubstituting this into the log term:\n$\\log\\left(1 + \\frac{\\bar{n}_j}{g_j}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}}\\right) = -\\log(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j})$\n\nSo, the final expression for entropy is:\n$S/k_B = \\beta \\langle E \\rangle - \\sum_j g_j \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j})$\nMultiplying by $k_B$:\n$S = k_B \\beta \\langle E \\rangle - k_B \\sum_j g_j \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j})$\nSince $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$, this can also be written as $S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T} - k_B \\sum_j g_j \\log(1 - e^{-\\epsilon_j/k_B T})$. This is a fundamental thermodynamic relation where the second term is related to the free energy.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values are expressed as functions of the parameter $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $T$ is the temperature, $\\epsilon_j$ is the energy of the $j$-th level, and $g_j$ is the degeneracy of that level.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_{j} \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n$S = k_B \\left( \\beta \\langle E \\rangle - \\sum_j g_j \\log(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right)$\n\n<<<Equilibrium Mean Energy: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_{j} \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = k_B \\left( \\beta \\langle E \\rangle - \\sum_j g_j \\log(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right)$>>>"
