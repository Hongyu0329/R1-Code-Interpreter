    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n**1. Understanding the Group and Involutions**\n\n*   **The Group:** The group in question is the Projective Special Unitary group PSU(4, 997). This group is constructed from the Special Unitary group SU(4, 997) by taking the quotient by its center, Z(SU(4, 997)).\n    *   SU(4, q) is the group of 4x4 matrices `A` over the field with `q^2` elements (here, F_997^2) such that `A^H A = I` (where `A^H` is the conjugate transpose) and `det(A) = 1`.\n    *   The center, Z(SU(n, q)), consists of scalar matrices `λI` where `λ^n = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    *   For PSU(4, 997), we have n=4 and q=997. The order of the center is `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Thus, the center Z is `{I, -I}`.\n\n*   **Involutions:** An involution in a group is an element `x` of order 2, meaning `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`.\n\n**2. Relating Involutions in PSU(4, q) to Elements in SU(4, q)**\n\nAn element `gZ` in PSU(4, q) = SU(4, q) / Z is an involution if and only if:\n1.  `(gZ)^2 = Z` (the identity in the quotient group). This means `g^2 Z = Z`, which implies `g^2` must be an element of the center `Z = {I, -I}`.\n2.  `gZ ≠ Z`. This means `g` is not an element of the center `Z`.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g ∉ {I, -I}` and `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}`. Let this set of preimages be `P`.\n\nThe set `P` can be divided into two disjoint subsets:\n*   `P_1 = {g ∈ SU(4, q) | g^2 = I, g ≠ I, g ≠ -I}`\n*   `P_2 = {g ∈ SU(4, q) | g^2 = -I}` (Note: if `g^2 = -I`, `g` cannot be `I` or `-I` since the characteristic is not 2).\n\nEach involution in PSU(4, q) corresponds to a coset `gZ` where `g ∈ P`. A coset `gZ` consists of `{g, -g}`. If `g ∈ P`, then `(-g)^2 = g^2 ∈ Z` and `-g ∉ Z`. Also `g ≠ -g`. Thus, for each involution in PSU(4, q), there are exactly two preimages in `P`.\nThe number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is therefore `|P| / |Z| = (|P_1| + |P_2|) / 2`.\n\n**3. Counting the Elements in `P_1`**\n\n*   The elements of `P_1` are involutions in SU(4, q), excluding `-I`. An involution in SU(4, q) is diagonalizable with eigenvalues 1 or -1. Let `k` be the number of -1 eigenvalues. Since the determinant must be 1, `(-1)^k = 1`, so `k` must be even (0, 2, or 4).\n    *   `k=0`: `g=I`. This is excluded from `P_1`.\n    *   `k=4`: `g=-I`. This is also excluded from `P_1`.\n    *   `k=2`: The eigenvalues are `{1, 1, -1, -1}`. These elements form a single conjugacy class in SU(4, q). The number of such elements is equal to the number of ways to choose a 2-dimensional non-degenerate subspace (the eigenspace for -1). This number can be calculated using the formula for the number of non-degenerate subspaces in a unitary geometry:\n        `|P_1| = |U(4, q)| / |U(2, q)|^2`\n        Using the orders `|U(n, q)| = q^(n(n-1)/2) * Π_{i=1 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`, we get:\n        `|P_1| = q^4 (q^2 + 1) (q^2 - q + 1)`\n\n**4. Counting the Elements in `P_2`**\n\n*   The elements of `P_2` are those `g ∈ SU(4, q)` for which `g^2 = -I`. The eigenvalues of such `g` must be `i` or `-i`.\n*   A critical point is the property of the field F_q where `q = 997`. Since `997 ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, the imaginary unit `i` is an element of F_997, and `i^q = i`.\n*   This allows us to establish a bijection `f: {g | g^2 = -I} → {h | h^2 = I}` within SU(4, q), given by `h = -ig`. The inverse is `g = ih`. The mapping preserves the `SU` condition because `i ∈ F_q`.\n*   Therefore, the number of elements with `g^2 = -I` is equal to the total number of elements with `h^2 = I`.\n    `|P_2| = |{h ∈ SU(4, q) | h^2 = I}|`\n    The elements `h` with `h^2=I` are `I`, `-I`, and the elements in `P_1`.\n    `|P_2| = |P_1| + |{I, -I}| = q^4 (q^2 + 1) (q^2 - q + 1) + 2`.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we combine the counts to find the total number of involutions.\n*   Total number of preimages: `|P| = |P_1| + |P_2| = [q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)] + [q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + 2]`\n    `|P| = 2 * q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + 2`\n*   Number of involutions in PSU(4, q) = `|P| / 2`\n    `= (2 * q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + 2) / 2`\n    `= q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + 1`\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`:\nThe number of involutions is `997^4 (997^2 + 1) (997^2 - 997 + 1) + 1`.\n\nWe can expand the polynomial part for a final expression:\n`q^4 (q^4 - q^3 + 2q^2 - q + 1) + 1 = q^8 - q^7 + 2q^6 - q^5 + q^4 + 1`.\n\nFinal Answer with q = 997:\n`997^8 - 997^7 + 2*997^6 - 997^5 + 997^4 + 1`.\n\nThis is the exact number of involutions.\n\n<<<1 + 997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)>>>"
