    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (the square in front of the Pantheon).\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\". This can refer to a building element, a structure, or a significant piece of urban design/infrastructure.\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n    *   **Timeframe:** The removal happened \"in 1950\". This date is very specific and is the most critical clue.\n    *   **Agent:** The \"city administration\" was responsible for the removal.\n\n2.  **Initial Research & Common Misconceptions (Careful Points):**\n    *   A very famous feature removed from the Pantheon itself was the pair of bell towers added by Bernini in the 17th century. These were widely disliked and derisively nicknamed \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the donkey's ears).\n    *   **Crucial Point:** While these were indeed a removed feature, they were dismantled in **1883**, not 1950. Therefore, the Bernini bell towers are the wrong answer. This is a common pitfall that must be avoided. We need to look for something that was removed specifically around 1950.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the 1950 Timeline and the Piazza:**\n    *   The question specifies the *Piazza* (the square), not just the Pantheon building. We need to consider features of the square itself.\n    *   Researching the history of Roman urban planning and public transport in the mid-20th century reveals significant changes. After World War II, Rome's city administration began a process of \"modernization,\" which involved replacing many of the city's tram lines with bus routes, especially in the crowded historical center.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Feature:**\n    *   Historical photographs and maps from the first half of the 20th century show that Piazza della Rotonda was a hub for the Roman tram network.\n    *   The \"unique architectural feature\" was a specific part of this network: a **circular tram track** or **tramway ring** that looped around the central fountain of the piazza, the Fontana del Pantheon.\n    *   This track allowed trams to turn around in the busy square, making it a functional and visually distinctive element of the piazza's layout for decades.\n\n5.  **Confirming the Removal:**\n    *   The policy of dismantling the tram network in the historic center was implemented in the years following WWII.\n    *   The tram lines running through and around the Piazza della Rotonda were indeed removed by the city's transport authority around **1950** to ease traffic congestion and replace the trams with more \"modern\" buses. This matches the date in the question perfectly.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe feature in question is not part of the Pantheon's ancient or baroque structure but a piece of 20th-century urban infrastructure. The unique feature was the circular tram track that ringed the fountain in the center of the piazza, which was removed as part of a city-wide transportation overhaul in 1950.\n\n<<<A circular tram track that looped around the central fountain."
