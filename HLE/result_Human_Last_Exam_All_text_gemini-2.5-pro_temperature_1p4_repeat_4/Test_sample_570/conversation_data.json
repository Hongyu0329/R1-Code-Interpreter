    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the set of lines\nThe problem asks for a convex domain `K` that intersects every line `L` with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet's denote the set of these lines by `\\mathcal{L}`. The condition `gcd(p,q)=1` means `p` and `q` are not both zero.\nExamples of such lines include:\n- `p=1, q=0`: `x=1`\n- `p=-1, q=0`: `-x=1` or `x=-1`\n- `p=0, q=1`: `y=1`\n- `p=0, q=-1`: `-y=1` or `y=-1`\n- `p=1, q=1`: `x+y=1`\n- `p=1, q=-1`: `x-y=1`\n- `p=-1, q=-1`: `-x-y=1` or `x+y=-1`\n- `p=2, q=1`: `2x+y=1`\n\nLet `v = (p,q)`. We call `v` a primitive integer vector. The set of lines can be written as `{x ∈ R² | v · x = 1, v \\text{ is a primitive integer vector}}`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the condition in terms of support functions\nLet `K` be a convex domain. The condition that `K` intersects the line `v · x = 1` means that the set of values `{v · x | x ∈ K}` must contain `1`.\nThe range of `v · x` for `x ∈ K` is the interval `[inf_{x∈K} v·x, sup_{x∈K} v·x]`.\nLet `h_K(v) = sup_{x∈K} v · x` be the support function of `K`.\nThen `inf_{x∈K} v · x = -sup_{x∈K} (-v) · x = -h_K(-v)`.\nThe condition that `K` intersects `v · x = 1` is equivalent to:\n`-h_K(-v) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(v)`\n\nThis must hold for all primitive integer vectors `v = (p,q)`.\nLet `S` be the set of all primitive integer vectors. If `v = (p,q) ∈ S`, then `-v = (-p,-q)` is also in `S` (since `gcd(-p,-q) = gcd(p,q) = 1`).\n\nSo, for any `v ∈ S`, we must satisfy the condition:\n1. `-h_K(-v) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(v)`\nApplying the same condition for `-v ∈ S`, we get:\n2. `-h_K(-(-v)) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(-v)`, which simplifies to `-h_K(v) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(-v)`.\n\nCombining these conditions:\nFrom `1`, we have `h_K(v) ≥ 1`.\nFrom `2`, we have `h_K(-v) ≥ 1`.\nThese two must hold for any `v ∈ S`. Since `v ∈ S` implies `-v ∈ S`, the conditions are symmetrical. The single condition is:\n`h_K(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S`.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the convex domain `K` of minimal area whose support function `h_K` satisfies `h_K(v) ≥ 1` for all primitive integer vectors `v`.\n\n### Step 3: Using Polar Duality\nThere is a deep connection between a convex body `K` and its polar dual `K*`. If `K` contains the origin, its polar dual is defined as:\n`K* = {y ∈ R² | x · y ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K}`\nThe support function of `K` relates to `K*` in a fundamental way: `K = {x ∈ R² | x · y ≤ h_K(y) for all y}`. A key property is that `(K*)* = K`.\n\nThe condition `h_K(v) = sup_{x∈K} x · v ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S` means that `v` cannot be in the interior of `K*`.\nWhy? If `v` were in `int(K*)`, then for some `ε > 0`, `(1+ε)v` would also be in `K*`. By definition of `K*`, this would mean `x · ((1+ε)v) ≤ 1` for all `x ∈ K`, which implies `x · v ≤ 1/(1+ε) < 1` for all `x ∈ K`. This contradicts `sup_{x∈K} x · v ≥ 1`.\n\nSo, the condition on `K` is equivalent to the condition that its polar dual `K*` has an interior `int(K*)` that contains no primitive integer vectors, i.e., `int(K*) ∩ S = ∅`.\n\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we should maximize `Area(K*)` subject to this constraint. This intuition comes from the Blaschke-Santaló inequality, which states that `Area(K) Area(K*)` is bounded above.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the largest convex body avoiding primitive integer points\nWe need to find the convex set `K*` of maximum possible area such that its interior contains no primitive integer points `(p,q)`.\n\nLet `K*` be such a set. The set of primitive integer vectors `S` includes `(1,0)`, `(-1,0)`, `(0,1)`, and `(0,-1)`.\nSince these points cannot be in the interior of `K*`, we must have:\n- For any point `(p,q) ∈ int(K*)`, `p < 1` and `p > -1`, so `-1 < p < 1`.\n- For any point `(p,q) ∈ int(K*)`, `q < 1` and `q > -1`, so `-1 < q < 1`.\n\nThis means the interior of `K*` must be a subset of the open square `(-1,1) × (-1,1)`. Consequently, the closure of `K*`, which is `K*` itself (as it's a closed set), must be a subset of the closed square `[-1,1] × [-1,1]`.\n\nThe convex set of maximum area contained within the square `[-1,1] × [-1,1]` is the square itself. Let's call this square `C`:\n`C = [-1,1] × [-1,1] = {(p,q) | |p| ≤ 1, |q| ≤ 1}`\nThe area of `C` is `2 × 2 = 4`.\nThe interior of `C` is `int(C) = (-1,1) × (-1,1)`. The only integer point in this region is `(0,0)`. A primitive integer vector must have `gcd(p,q)=1`, which is not usually defined for `(0,0)` and this point is excluded from `S`. Therefore, `int(C)` contains no primitive integer points.\n\nSo, the maximal area for `K*` is 4, and the body that achieves this is `C = [-1,1] × [-1,1]`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the minimal area\nThe minimal-area domain `K` we are looking for is the polar dual of this maximal-area `K* = C`.\n`K = C* = {x ∈ R² | p*x₁ + q*x₂ ≤ 1 for all (p,q) ∈ C}`.\nThe condition `p*x₁ + q*x₂ ≤ 1` must hold for all `p ∈ [-1,1]` and `q ∈ [-1,1]`. The maximum value of `p*x₁ + q*x₂` for `(p,q)` in the square `C` is obtained at one of the four corners `(±1, ±1)` and is equal to `|x₁| + |x₂|`.\nSo the inequality becomes `|x₁| + |x₂| ≤ 1`.\n\nThe resulting domain `K` is the square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\nThe area of this diamond-shaped square is `(1/2) × (\\text{diagonal 1}) × (\\text{diagonal 2}) = (1/2) × 2 × 2 = 2`.\n\nThis domain `K = {(x,y) | |x|+|y|≤1}` intersects all the required lines and has an area of 2. Based on the duality argument, this is the minimal possible area.\n\nFinal check: The support function of `K = {(x,y) | |x|+|y|≤1}` is `h_K(p,q) = max(|p|,|q|)`. For any primitive integer vector `(p,q)`, `(p,q) ≠ (0,0)`. So at least one of `p` or `q` is a non-zero integer, which means `|p|≥1` or `|q|≥1`. Thus `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1`, which satisfies the condition `h_K(v)≥1` derived in Step 2.\n\n>>>2"
