    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Theory**\n\nWe consider the O(N)-symmetric scalar field theory ($\\phi^4$ theory) in Euclidean spacetime with $d$ dimensions. The Lagrangian is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\mu \\phi_a)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} r_0 \\phi_a^2 + \\frac{u_0}{4!} (\\phi_a^2)^2 $$\nHere, $\\phi_a$ is an N-component scalar field ($a = 1, \\dots, N$), and $\\phi_a^2 = \\sum_{a=1}^N \\phi_a \\phi_a$. $u_0$ is the bare coupling constant. The question refers to \"the $\\phi^4$ theory\", which usually implies the single-component case (N=1), but we will carry out the analysis for general N first.\n\n**2. Renormalization and the Beta Function**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the Renormalization Group (RG) analysis. We are interested in how the properties of the theory change with the energy scale. This is described by the RG flow of the coupling constant.\n\nIn $d=4$ dimensions, the coupling constant $u_0$ is dimensionless. Near four dimensions, we set $d=4-\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small parameter. The bare coupling $u_0$ now has a mass dimension of $[M]^{4-d} = [M]^\\epsilon$. We define a dimensionless renormalized coupling, $u$, through the relation $u_0 = u \\mu^\\epsilon$, where $\\mu$ is an arbitrary renormalization mass scale.\n\nThe beta function, $\\beta(u)$, describes the \"running\" of this dimensionless coupling $u$ with the scale $\\mu$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} $$\nA fixed point, $u^*$, is a value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant, meaning the coupling stops running. This corresponds to a zero of the beta function: $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Beta Function to One Loop**\n\nThe beta function is calculated perturbatively. In the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme using dimensional regularization, one calculates loop corrections to the vertices of the theory and introduces counter-terms to cancel the ultraviolet divergences, which appear as poles in $1/\\epsilon$.\n\nFor the $\\phi^4$ theory, we need to renormalize the four-point vertex. At one-loop, three Feynman diagrams (s, t, and u channels) contribute. The calculation is standard in quantum field theory and yields the following one-loop beta function for the O(N) model:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{N+8}{48\\pi^2} u^2 + O(u^3) $$\n\n**Careful Points for this step:**\n*   The first term, $-\\epsilon u$, arises from the engineering dimension of the coupling constant in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions.\n*   The second term, proportional to $u^2$, arises from the one-loop quantum corrections to the four-point vertex.\n*   The combinatorial factor $(N+8)$ is a result of summing over the internal indices and the different (s, t, u) channels in the O(N) model.\n*   This calculation is performed at one-loop order, which is sufficient to find the fixed point to the leading order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**4. Finding the Fixed Point**\n\nTo find the fixed points, we solve the equation $\\beta(u^*) = 0$:\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{N+8}{48\\pi^2} (u^*)^2 = 0 $$\nThis equation can be factored:\n$$ u^* \\left(-\\epsilon + \\frac{N+8}{48\\pi^2} u^*\\right) = 0 $$\nThis yields two solutions:\n\n1.  **The Gaussian Fixed Point:** $u^*_G = 0$. This corresponds to a free, non-interacting theory. For $\\epsilon > 0$ (i.e., $d<4$), this fixed point is unstable.\n2.  **The Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point:** This is the non-trivial solution found by setting the term in the parenthesis to zero:\n    $$ -\\epsilon + \\frac{N+8}{48\\pi^2} u^* = 0 $$\n    $$ u^* = \\frac{48\\pi^2}{N+8} \\epsilon $$\nThis fixed point is stable for $\\epsilon > 0$ and governs the universal critical behavior of the theory.\n\n**5. Specifying to the $\\phi^4$ Theory (N=1)**\n\nThe question asks for the fixed point in \"the $\\phi^4$ theory\". This standardly refers to the simplest case of a single real scalar field, which corresponds to setting $N=1$ in our general O(N) result.\n\nSubstituting $N=1$ into the expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point:\n$$ u^* = \\frac{48\\pi^2}{1+8} \\epsilon = \\frac{48\\pi^2}{9} \\epsilon $$\nSimplifying the fraction gives the final expression:\n$$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon $$\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling in terms of $\\epsilon$. Higher-order terms in the beta function would contribute corrections of order $\\epsilon^2$ and higher to this result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe leading order expression for the non-trivial (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point coupling $u^*$ in the single-component $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions ($d=4-\\epsilon$) is:\n$$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon $$\n\n<<<u^* = (16*pi^2/3) * epsilon>>>"
