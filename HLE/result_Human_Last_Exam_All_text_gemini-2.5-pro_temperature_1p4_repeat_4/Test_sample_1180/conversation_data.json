    "Answering this question involves finding the stable reduction of the given hyperelliptic curve and then computing a specific invariant of a singular point in that reduction.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the problem and find a suitable model.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\nWe are working over a 2-adic field, so we use the valuation $v=v_2$ normalized by $v(2)=1$. The ring of integers is $R=\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and the residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nLet's look at the reduction of the curve modulo 2. The equation becomes $z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, which is $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nThe special fiber is a non-reduced line $z=1$ in the affine plane over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This indicates that the curve has bad reduction. The given model is not regular.\n\nTo find a better model, we perform a change of variables. The reduction being $(z-1)^2=0$ suggests a change of variable centered around $z=1$. Let $z_1 = z-1$.\nThe equation becomes $(z_1+1)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n$z_1^2 + 2z_1 + 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$z_1^2 + 2z_1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$.\n\nAll terms in this equation are divisible by 2 except possibly $z_1^2$. Let's try to resolve this by extending the base field. The form of the equation suggests that the bad reduction is of \"type $I_n$\".\nLet's consider the field extension $K=\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt{2})$. The valuation on $K$ is given by $v(\\sqrt{2}) = 1/2$. Let $\\pi = \\sqrt{2}$ be a uniformizer for the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$.\nLet's try the substitution $z_1 = \\pi w = \\sqrt{2}w$.\n$(\\sqrt{2}w)^2 + 2(\\sqrt{2}w) = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\n$2w^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}w = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\nDividing by 2, we get a new model for the curve over $K$:\n$w^2 + \\sqrt{2}w = x^5 + x^3$\n$w^2 + \\pi w = x^5+x^3$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the special fiber of the new model.**\nLet's look at the reduction of this new model modulo $\\pi = \\sqrt{2}$. The residue field is still $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThe equation becomes: $w^2 \\equiv x^5+x^3 \\pmod \\pi$.\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this is $w^2 = x^3(x^2+1) = x^3(x+1)^2$.\nThe special fiber is a singular, but reduced, curve. Let's find its singular points.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w}(w^2 - x^3(x+1)^2) = 2w \\equiv 0 \\pmod \\pi$.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(w^2 - x^5 - x^3) = -5x^4 - 3x^2 \\equiv x^4+x^2 = x^2(x+1)^2 \\pmod 2$.\nFor a point to be singular, both partial derivatives must be zero. This requires $x=0$ or $x=1$.\nIf $x=0$, the curve equation gives $w^2=0$, so $w=0$. The point is $P_0=(x,w)=(0,0)$.\nIf $x=1$, the curve equation gives $w^2=1(1+1)^2=0$, so $w=0$. The point is $P_1=(x,w)=(1,0)$.\nSo, the special fiber has two singular points: $P_0=(0,0)$ and $P_1=(1,0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the nature of the singularities.**\nLet's analyze the singularity at $P_1=(1,0)$. We make a local change of coordinates, setting $X=x-1$.\nThe model equation is $w^2+\\pi w - x^5-x^3 = 0$. Substituting $x=X+1$:\n$w^2+\\pi w - ((X+1)^5+(X+1)^3) = 0$.\nLet's expand the polynomial in $X$ and look at the lowest order terms:\n$(X+1)^5+(X+1)^3 = (1+5X+10X^2+...)+(1+3X+3X^2+...) = 2+8X+13X^2+...$\nThe equation near $(X,w)=(0,0)$ is $w^2+\\pi w - (2+8X+...) = 0$.\nSubstituting $2=\\pi^2$:\n$w^2+\\pi w - (\\pi^2+4\\pi^2 X+...) = 0$.\nThe tangent cone at $(X,w)=(0,0)$ modulo $\\pi$ is given by the lowest degree terms in the reduction: $w^2=0$. This is not helpful.\nLet's analyze the structure more closely. The special fiber $w^2=x^3(x+1)^2$ near $x=1$ looks like $w^2=(x-1)^2$.\nThis suggests that the singularity is a node (an ordinary double point). Let $u=w-(x-1)$ and $v=w+(x-1)$. The special fiber is locally $uv=0$.\nA node in the special fiber corresponds to a \"double point\" in the stable reduction.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the thickness of the double point.**\nThe thickness of a node is an integer $n$ that measures how \"thin\" the neck of the corresponding annulus is in the analytic picture of the curve. It appears in the local equation of the stable model as $uv = t$, where the thickness is $v(t)$.\nLet's examine the model $w^2+\\pi w - (x^5+x^3) = 0$ near the point $P_1=(1,0)$ on the special fiber. Let $x=1+X$.\nThe equation is $w^2+\\pi w - f(X) = 0$, where $f(X)=(1+X)^5+(1+X)^3$.\n$f(0)=2=\\pi^2$. So, for $X=0$, we have $w^2+\\pi w - \\pi^2=0$.\nThe two branches of the curve passing over the singular point have $w$-coordinates given by the roots of this quadratic equation:\n$w = \\frac{-\\pi \\pm \\sqrt{\\pi^2 - 4(1)(-\\pi^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-\\pi \\pm \\sqrt{5\\pi^2}}{2} = \\frac{-\\pi \\pm \\pi\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)$.\nThe terms $\\phi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $1-\\phi = \\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ are units in $\\mathbb{Z}_2[\\sqrt{5}]$, which is an unramified extension of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, so their valuation is 0.\nThe two points on the generic fiber that reduce to $P_1$ are approximately $(x,w) = (1, -\\pi\\phi)$ and $(x,w)=(1, \\pi(\\phi-1))$.\nThe formation of a node is governed by completing the square in the equation for $w$:\n$(w+\\pi/2)^2 = f(X) + \\pi^2/4$.\nNear $X=0$, $f(X) \\approx f(0)+f'(0)X = \\pi^2 + (5+3)X = \\pi^2+8X = \\pi^2+4\\pi^2 X$.\nSo, $(w+\\pi/2)^2 \\approx \\pi^2+4\\pi^2 X + \\pi^2/4 = \\frac{5\\pi^2}{4}+4\\pi^2 X$.\nLet $W=w+\\pi/2$. The equation is $W^2 \\approx \\frac{5\\pi^2}{4}(1+\\frac{16}{5}X)$.\nThis shows two branches $W \\approx \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{5}\\pi}{2}\\sqrt{1+\\dots}$.\nThe canonical way to find the thickness is to note that the degeneration is of type $I_n$.\nThe model is $w^2+\\pi w-(x^5+x^3)=0$. A quadratic in $w$ with discriminant $\\Delta(x) = (\\pi)^2-4(1)(-(x^5+x^3)) = \\pi^2+4(x^5+x^3)=2+4(x^5+x^3)$.\nAt the point $x=1$ where the node occurs, the \"value\" of the discriminant is $\\Delta(1)=2+4(1+1)=10$.\nThe thickness of the node is given by $n=v(\\Delta(1))=v(10)=v(2\\cdot 5)=v(2)+v(5)=1+0=1$.\nThis value corresponds to the fact that two roots of the quadratic in $w$ (defining the two sheets of the curve) coalesce modulo $\\pi$, and the valuation of the discriminant at that point determines the \"thickness\" of the resulting singularity.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is the valuation of the parameter that creates the node. In our local analysis, this parameter is effectively $\\Delta(1)=10$, and its valuation is 1.\n\nFinal Answer should be an integer.\n\nFinal calculation: The thickness of a node of type $I_n$ arising from $y^2 = f(x)$ is $n=v(\\text{discriminant})$. Here our model is quadratic in $w$, $w^2+\\pi w -(x^5+x^3) = 0$. The discriminant is $\\Delta(x) = \\pi^2+4(x^5+x^3)$. The node in the special fiber is at $x=1$. We evaluate $v(\\Delta(1))$.\n$\\Delta(1) = \\pi^2 + 4(1+1) = 2+8=10$.\n$v(\\Delta(1)) = v_{2}(10)=1$.\nThe thickness of the double point is 1."
