    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Decompose the Character**\nThe character in question is 謄.\nThis character has a distinct left-right structure (known as a 偏旁 'henbō' structure).\n*   The left-side component is 言.\n*   The right-side component is 朕.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese kanji with a left-right structure, the left-side component (called the 偏 'hen') is almost always the radical used for classification in dictionaries.\n*   The left component is 言.\n*   Therefore, the radical for the character 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nRadicals often have specific names based on their form and position within a character.\n*   The radical is 言 (meaning: word, speech). Its on'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) is \"gon\".\n*   When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\". The voiced form of \"hen\" is \"ben\".\n*   Combining these, the name for the 言 radical when it is on the left side is \"Gonben\" (ごんべん).\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe Japanese name is ごんべん.\n*   ご (go)\n*   ん (n)\n*   べ (be)\n*   ん (n)\nThe correct Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to correctly separate the character into its left and right parts. For 謄, the division between 言 and 朕 is clear.\n*   One must know the general rule that the left-side component ('hen') is typically the radical in such characters.\n*   Knowing the specific name for the radical in its position is key. The radical 言 is known as \"Gonben\" when it functions as a 'hen'.\n*   The spelling must conform to Hepburn romanization, as is standard for Japanese transcription.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer can be determined.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
