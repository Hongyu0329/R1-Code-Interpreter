    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers from 1905. Its German title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Initial Research on Citations:** The first careful point to note is a well-documented historical fact: Einstein's 1905 papers, including the one on Brownian motion, **contain no formal bibliography or list of references**. In the strict, modern sense of academic citation, he did not cite anyone's work.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Phrasing of the Question:** The question uses the specific term \"lectures\" and the verb \"cite.\" Given the lack of a formal reference list, the question is likely referring to an intellectual influence whose major work was known in the form of \"lectures.\" The term \"cite\" is likely being used more broadly to mean \"intellectually sourced from\" or \"built upon the work of.\"\n\n5.  **Investigate Intellectual Influences:** The theoretical foundation of Einstein's paper is statistical mechanics. Einstein's great achievement was to apply the statistical concepts of the kinetic theory of heat to the visible motion of suspended particles. The primary founder and developer of this statistical approach to thermodynamics was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**.\n\n6.  **Connect the Influence to \"Lectures\":** The crucial link is the title of Ludwig Boltzmann's most famous and comprehensive work on this subject. His book, published in two volumes in 1896 and 1898, is titled ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie***, which translates to ***Lectures on Gas Theory***. Although Einstein had not attended Boltzmann's lectures in person, he studied this book intently. This book was the main source for his understanding of Boltzmann's ideas.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion does not contain a formal list of citations, his theoretical framework relies heavily on the principles of statistical mechanics developed by Ludwig Boltzmann. The primary work by Boltzmann that Einstein would have studied was his famous book titled *Lectures on Gas Theory* (*Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*). Therefore, the question refers to the published lectures of Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
