    "This question asks for the identification of a specific mathematical expression, $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, within the functional integral formalism of finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field. Let's break down the problem and analyze it step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. The Context: Finite-Temperature Field Theory and the Partition Function**\n\n*   In finite-temperature field theory, we study quantum systems in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$. The central object is the partition function, $Z$.\n*   The partition function is formulated using a path integral in Euclidean spacetime. This is achieved by performing a Wick rotation from real time $t$ to imaginary time $\\tau = it$.\n*   For a bosonic field theory, the field configurations $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$ must be periodic in imaginary time with period $\\beta = 1/T$ (in natural units where $k_B = 1$). This means $\\phi(0, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\beta, \\mathbf{x})$.\n*   The partition function $Z$ for a neutral scalar field $\\phi$ is given by the functional integral:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n    where $\\mathcal{D}\\phi$ is the functional measure over all periodic field configurations and $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action.\n\n**2. The Euclidean Action for a Neutral Scalar Field**\n\n*   The Euclidean action $S_E$ is obtained from the Minkowskian action by the Wick rotation. For a neutral scalar field with mass $m$ and a potential term $V(\\phi)$, the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is:\n    $\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 + V(\\phi)$\n    Here, $(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 = (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2$.\n*   The Euclidean action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over Euclidean spacetime, which has a compact time dimension of length $\\beta$:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E[\\phi, \\partial_\\mu \\phi]$\n\n**3. The Inner Product Notation and the Quadratic Action**\n\n*   The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ suggests an inner product structure. In functional analysis, the inner product of two real functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ over a domain $\\Omega$ is defined as $(f, g) = \\int_\\Omega dx \\, f(x) g(x)$.\n*   This structure naturally appears when we consider the *free* or *quadratic* part of the action, which is the part of the action that is quadratic in the field $\\phi$. Let's set the interaction term $V(\\phi)$ to zero for now (or consider only its quadratic part).\n*   The free Euclidean action is:\n    $S_E^{(2)}[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n**4. Identifying the Operator D via Integration by Parts**\n\n*   To write the action in the form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$, we need to use integration by parts to move the derivatives off one of the $\\phi$ fields.\n*   Consider the kinetic term $\\int \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2$.\n    *   For the time derivative term:\n        $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, (\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 = \\left[ \\phi(\\partial_\\tau\\phi) \\right]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi(\\partial_\\tau^2\\phi)$\n        The boundary term $\\left[ \\phi(\\partial_\\tau\\phi) \\right]_0^\\beta = \\phi(\\beta, \\mathbf{x})\\partial_\\tau\\phi(\\beta, \\mathbf{x}) - \\phi(0, \\mathbf{x})\\partial_\\tau\\phi(0, \\mathbf{x})$ vanishes because the field $\\phi$ (and its derivatives) are periodic in $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$.\n    *   For the spatial derivative term:\n        $\\int d^3x \\, (\\nabla\\phi)^2 = \\oint_{S_\\infty} d\\mathbf{S} \\cdot (\\phi\\nabla\\phi) - \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\nabla^2\\phi)$\n        The surface integral over the boundary at spatial infinity vanishes under the physical assumption that fields decay to zero sufficiently fast at large distances.\n*   Applying integration by parts to the action, we get:\n    $S_E^{(2)}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\left[ \\phi(-\\partial_\\tau^2\\phi) + \\phi(-\\nabla^2\\phi) + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n*   Factoring out the fields $\\phi$:\n    $S_E^{(2)}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\n\n**5. The Final Identification**\n\n*   The action is now in the form $\\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D\\phi)$, where the inner product is the integral over Euclidean spacetime and $D$ is the differential operator acting on the second $\\phi$.\n*   By direct comparison, we identify the operator $D$ (which the question writes as $D_\\phi$, likely meaning \"the operator D for the field phi\") as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$\n*   Therefore, the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is the full integral expression for the quadratic part of the action (without the overall factor of 1/2).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Euclidean vs. Minkowskian:** The entire setup is in Euclidean spacetime. The operator $D$ is the *Euclidean* Klein-Gordon operator, which is elliptic ($-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2$ is the 4D Laplacian), unlike its hyperbolic Minkowskian counterpart ($\\partial_t^2 - \\nabla^2$).\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** The use of integration by parts is critically dependent on the boundary conditions. The periodicity in imaginary time for bosonic fields is essential for the boundary term in $\\tau$ to vanish. The decay of fields at spatial infinity is a standard physical requirement.\n3.  **The Notation:** The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is standard shorthand in path integral literature. It represents the quadratic form defined by the operator $D$ and integrated over the appropriate spacetime volume.\n4.  **Free vs. Interacting Theory:** This inner product expression precisely corresponds to the free (Gaussian) part of the theory. The partition function of an interacting theory is $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi) - S_{int}[\\phi]\\right)$, where $S_{int}[\\phi] = \\int d^4x_E V(\\phi)$ contains the interaction terms. The expression $(\\phi, D\\phi)$ is fundamental as it defines the propagator of the field and is the starting point for perturbation theory.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe quantity $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action, expressed as a functional inner product. Based on the analysis above, we can write its explicit form.\n\nThe inner product is an integral over the 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime volume defined by the thermal problem, which is $[0, \\beta] \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. The operator $D$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. Therefore, the expression is:\n\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left( -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   $\\tau$ is the imaginary time coordinate.\n*   $\\mathbf{x}$ are the three spatial coordinates.\n*   $\\nabla^2$ is the spatial Laplacian, $\\nabla^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2}$.\n*   $m$ is the mass of the scalar field.\n*   $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$ is the real scalar field, subject to the periodic boundary condition $\\phi(0, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\beta, \\mathbf{x})$.\n\n<<<($\\phi$, D_$\\phi$) = $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left( -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$>>>"
