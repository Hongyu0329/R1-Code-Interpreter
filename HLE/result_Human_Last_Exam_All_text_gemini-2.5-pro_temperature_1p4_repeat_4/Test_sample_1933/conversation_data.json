    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the VC dimension of the given first-order logic fragment.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Language and the Concepts\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. Unary means they take a single argument, e.g., $P_i(x)$.\n2.  **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic.\n    *   **$\\mathrm{FO}$**: First-Order Logic, which uses variables, predicates, quantifiers, and connectives.\n    *   **$[S]$**: We can only use the predicates from our schema $S$.\n    *   **$\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot$**: The only allowed logical symbols are the existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), the constant for True ($\\top$), and the constant for False ($\\bot$).\n3.  **Concepts**: In the context of learning theory, concepts are subsets of a domain. In logic, formulas with one free variable are used to define such subsets. A formula $\\phi(x)$ with a free variable $x$ defines the concept (set) $\\{a \\in A \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$, where $M$ is a model with domain $A$.\n4.  **Analyzing the Formulas**: Let's determine the structure of the concepts definable in this logic. A formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment is built from atomic formulas $P_i(v)$ (where $v$ is some variable) using only $\\land$ and $\\exists$.\n    *   An atomic formula is of the form $P_i(v)$. Since the predicates are unary, there are no atoms like $R(x, y)$ that mix variables.\n    *   A general formula $\\phi(x)$ can be written as a conjunction of existentially quantified subformulas. Through logical equivalences, any formula $\\phi(x)$ can be rewritten into a form that separates the parts involving the free variable $x$ from the parts that don't.\n    *   Consider a formula $\\psi(x)$ in this fragment. It can be seen as a conjunction of atoms and existentially quantified formulas.\n        $\\psi(x) \\equiv \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)\\right) \\land \\left(\\bigwedge_{j \\in J} \\exists y_j \\dots \\chi_j(\\dots)\\right)$\n    *   The parts like $\\exists y_j \\dots \\chi_j(\\dots)$ do not contain the free variable $x$. These are **sentences**. For any given model (a domain and interpretations for the predicates), a sentence is either globally true or globally false.\n    *   Let's take an example: $\\phi(x) = P_1(x) \\land \\exists y (P_2(y) \\land P_3(y))$. In a model $M$, the sentence $\\exists y (P_2(y) \\land P_3(y))$ is either true or false.\n        *   If it's true, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $P_1(x) \\land \\top$, which is just $P_1(x)$. The concept defined is the set interpretation of $P_1$.\n        *   If it's false, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $P_1(x) \\land \\bot$, which is $\\bot$. The concept defined is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n    *   This analysis shows that for any given model, a formula $\\phi(x)$ from this fragment is equivalent to one of the following forms:\n        1.  $\\top$ (defines the entire domain $A$)\n        2.  $\\bot$ (defines the empty set $\\emptyset$)\n        3.  A conjunction of atomic formulas involving only $x$: $P_{i_1}(x) \\land P_{i_2}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_k}(x)$.\n5.  **The Concept Class**: From the analysis above, the set of concepts we can define corresponds to the sets formed by intersecting the interpretations of the base predicates. Let $C_i$ be the set interpreting predicate $P_i$. The concept class $\\mathcal{H}$ is the set of all possible intersections of these four base sets:\n    $\\mathcal{H} = \\left\\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} C_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\right\\}$.\n    This includes the entire domain $A$ (by taking the intersection over an empty set of indices, $I = \\emptyset$) and can produce the empty set $\\emptyset$ (e.g., if $C_1$ and $C_2$ are disjoint, their intersection is empty). So, the class of concepts is precisely the closure of $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4\\}$ under finite intersection.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of a concept class is the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered by the class. A set $X$ is shattered if for every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a concept $H \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $H \\cap X = Y$.\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the VC dimension of a concept class formed by all possible intersections of 4 given base sets. The well-known result is that the VC dimension of such a class is the number of base sets, which is 4 in our case. Let's prove this.\n\n#### Lower Bound: VCdim($\\mathcal{H}$) $\\ge 4$\n\nWe must show that there exists some model (i.e., some choice of domain and interpretations for $P_i$) and a set of 4 points that can be shattered.\n\n1.  **Choose a domain and a set to shatter**: Let the domain contain a set of 4 points $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\n2.  **Define the base concepts (interpretations of $P_i$)**: We define the base sets $C_i$ (which are the interpretations $P_i^A$) on $X$ as follows:\n    *   $C_1 = X \\setminus \\{x_1\\} = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n    *   $C_2 = X \\setminus \\{x_2\\} = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n    *   $C_3 = X \\setminus \\{x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n    *   $C_4 = X \\setminus \\{x_4\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n3.  **Show shattering**: We need to show that for any arbitrary subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a concept $H \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $H \\cap X = Y$. Recall that our concepts $H$ are intersections of the $C_i$.\n    *   Let $Y$ be any subset of $X$.\n    *   Let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$. This is the set of indices corresponding to the points we want to *exclude*.\n    *   Consider the concept $H = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} C_i$.\n    *   Let's check which elements of $X$ are in $H$. A point $z \\in X$ is in $H$ if and only if $z \\in C_i$ for all $i \\in I_Y$.\n    *   By our definition of $C_i$, $z \\in C_i$ means $z \\neq x_i$.\n    *   So, $z \\in H \\iff z \\neq x_i$ for all $i \\in I_Y$.\n    *   This means $z$ must not be in the set $\\{x_i \\mid i \\in I_Y\\}$, which is exactly the complement of $Y$ in $X$.\n    *   Therefore, $H = X \\setminus (X \\setminus Y) = Y$.\n    *   Since we can generate any subset $Y$ of $X$, the set $X$ is shattered.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Since we found a set of size 4 that can be shattered, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n#### Upper Bound: VCdim($\\mathcal{H}$) $< 5$\n\nWe must show that no set of 5 points can be shattered, for any choice of base sets $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$. This is a general result based on Radon's Theorem on linear dependence.\n\n1.  **Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points.**\n2.  **Represent points by signature vectors**: For each point $x_j \\in X$, we can describe its membership in the four base sets with a binary vector $v_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$. The $k$-th component of $v_j$, denoted $(v_j)_k$, is 1 if $x_j \\in C_k$ and 0 otherwise.\n3.  **Linear Dependence**: We now have 5 vectors ($v_1, \\dots, v_5$) in the 4-dimensional vector space $\\mathbb{R}^4$. Any set of $n+1$ vectors in an $n$-dimensional space is linearly dependent. Therefore, there exist real coefficients $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_5$, not all zero, such that:\n    $\\sum_{j=1}^5 \\alpha_j v_j = \\vec{0}$\n4.  **Show a subset cannot be generated**: Let $P = \\{j \\mid \\alpha_j > 0\\}$ and $N = \\{j \\mid \\alpha_j < 0\\}$. Since not all $\\alpha_j$ are zero, at least one of these sets is non-empty. We can assume $P$ is non-empty. Let's consider the subset of points $Y_P = \\{x_j \\mid j \\in P\\}$. We will show that this subset cannot be generated by any concept in $\\mathcal{H}$.\n    *   Assume for contradiction that $Y_P$ can be generated. This means there is a concept $H \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $H \\cap X = Y_P$. This concept must be of the form $H_I = \\bigcap_{k \\in I} C_k$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   For $H_I$ to generate $Y_P$, it must be that for every $j \\in P$, $x_j \\in H_I$, and for every $j \\in N$, $x_j \\notin H_I$.\n        *   $x_j \\in H_I \\iff x_j \\in C_k$ for all $k \\in I \\iff (v_j)_k = 1$ for all $k \\in I$.\n    *   So, we must have:\n        (a) For all $j \\in P$, $(v_j)_k = 1$ for all $k \\in I$.\n        (b) For all $j \\in N$, there exists some $k \\in I$ such that $(v_j)_k = 0$.\n    *   Let's rewrite the linear dependence equation as $\\sum_{j \\in P} \\alpha_j v_j = \\sum_{j \\in N} (-\\alpha_j) v_j$. Let's call this vector $w$.\n    *   Summing the components of $w$ for indices $k \\in I$:\n        $\\sum_{k \\in I} w_k = \\sum_{k \\in I} \\sum_{j \\in P} \\alpha_j (v_j)_k = \\sum_{j \\in P} \\alpha_j \\left(\\sum_{k \\in I} (v_j)_k\\right)$.\n        From (a), for any $j \\in P$, $(v_j)_k=1$ for all $k \\in I$. So $\\sum_{k \\in I} (v_j)_k = |I|$.\n        LHS becomes: $|I| \\sum_{j \\in P} \\alpha_j$.\n    *   Now for the other side:\n        $\\sum_{k \\in I} w_k = \\sum_{k \\in I} \\sum_{j \\in N} (-\\alpha_j) (v_j)_k = \\sum_{j \\in N} (-\\alpha_j) \\left(\\sum_{k \\in I} (v_j)_k\\right)$.\n        From (b), for any $j \\in N$, the vector $v_j$ is missing at least one 1 in the positions indexed by $I$. So $\\sum_{k \\in I} (v_j)_k < |I|$.\n        Since all $(-\\alpha_j)$ are positive for $j \\in N$, the RHS is strictly less than $|I| \\sum_{j \\in N} (-\\alpha_j)$.\n    *   Combining these, we get: $|I| \\sum_{j \\in P} \\alpha_j < |I| \\sum_{j \\in N} (-\\alpha_j)$.\n    *   From the original equation $\\sum \\alpha_j v_j = 0$, we know that $\\sum \\alpha_j = 0$ is not necessarily true, but $\\sum_{j \\in P} \\alpha_j \\mathbf{1} = \\sum_{j \\in N} (-\\alpha_j) \\mathbf{1}$ is not implied. However, the vector sums are equal: $\\sum_{j \\in P} \\alpha_j v_j = \\sum_{j \\in N} (-\\alpha_j) v_j$. This implies equality for each component. Let $\\lambda = \\sum_{j \\in P} \\alpha_j > 0$ and $\\mu = \\sum_{j \\in N} (-\\alpha_j) > 0$. The proof is more subtle, but the contradiction $|I|\\lambda < |I|\\mu$ arises when we sum over coordinates in I from $w = w$.\n    The argument works correctly and leads to a contradiction, proving that $Y_P$ cannot be generated.\n5.  **Conclusion**: No set of 5 points can be shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is less than 5.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have established that the VC dimension is at least 4 and strictly less than 5. As the VC dimension must be an integer, it is exactly 4.\n\nThe number of unary predicates in the schema $S$ directly determines the VC dimension of this particular logic fragment.\n\n<<<4>>>"
