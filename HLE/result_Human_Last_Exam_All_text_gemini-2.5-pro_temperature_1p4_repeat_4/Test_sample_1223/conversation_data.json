    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Problem Statement\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms and the setup of the problem.\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ with the property that every subcontinuum of $X$ is indecomposable. A continuum is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **$X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** We start with a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and remove a single point $x$. The resulting space, let's call it $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, is a locally compact, non-compact, and connected metric space. The fact that $Y$ is connected is a known property of indecomposable continua (removing a single point does not disconnect them).\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification ($\\beta Y$):** This is the largest possible compact Hausdorff space that contains $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder ($Y^*$):** This is the set of points added to $Y$ to make it compact, i.e., $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$. Since $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, connected, and sigma-compact space (as $X$ is a metric continuum, hence second-countable and separable), its Stone-Cech remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum.\n*   **Composants of a continuum:** For a continuum $K$, its composants are equivalence classes under the relation where $p \\sim q$ if there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The number of composants is the number of these equivalence classes.\n*   **The Question:** We are asked for the maximum possible number of composants that the remainder continuum $Y^*$ can have. The term \"maximum possible\" implies that we can choose the hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$ and the point $x \\in X$ freely to maximize this number.\n\n### Step 2: Introducing the Decisive Theorem\n\nThe solution to this problem hinges on a powerful theorem in continuum theory established by H. Cook.\n\n**Cook's Theorem:** For any metric continuum $K$, there exists a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ such that the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is homeomorphic to $K$.\n\nIn symbols, for any metric continuum $K$, we can find a pair $(X, x)$ satisfying the problem's conditions such that:\n$ \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\cong K $\nwhere $\\cong$ denotes homeomorphism.\n\n### Step 3: Rephrasing the Problem\n\nCook's theorem establishes that the set of all possible remainders we can obtain by varying $X$ and $x$ is, up to homeomorphism, the set of all metric continua. Therefore, the question \"What is the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder?\" is equivalent to the following simpler question:\n\n\"What is the maximum number of composants that a metric continuum can have?\"\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Number of Composants of a Metric Continuum\n\nNow we analyze the number of composants for different types of metric continua. A metric continuum must be either decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Case 1: Decomposable Continua**\n    A continuum $K$ is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, $K = A \\cup B$. For such a continuum, it can be shown that for any two points $p, q \\in K$, there is a proper subcontinuum of $K$ that contains both $p$ and $q$. This means that all points belong to the same composant.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The composant of any point is the entire space itself.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant. Examples include a line segment, a disk, or a sphere.\n\n*   **Case 2: Indecomposable Continua**\n    A continuum $K$ is indecomposable if it is not decomposable. For indecomposable metric continua, the situation is drastically different. A fundamental result (due to Mazurkiewicz) states that every indecomposable metric continuum has uncountably many composants.\n    *   **Careful Point:** More precisely, the number of composants in any indecomposable metric continuum is equal to the cardinality of the continuum, which is $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Each composant is a dense, connected, $F_\\sigma$ subset of the continuum.\n    *   **Conclusion:** An indecomposable metric continuum has exactly **$2^{\\aleph_0}$** composants. Examples include the pseudo-arc and solenoids.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Maximum and Final Answer\n\nWe are looking for the maximum possible number of composants. Comparing the two cases:\n*   Decomposable continua: 1 composant.\n*   Indecomposable continua: $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n\nThe maximum of these two values is clearly $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nTo ensure this maximum is attainable, we just need to confirm that an indecomposable metric continuum exists. As mentioned, the pseudo-arc is a well-known example.\n1.  Let $K$ be the pseudo-arc, which is an indecomposable metric continuum.\n2.  The number of composants of the pseudo-arc is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n3.  By Cook's theorem, there exists a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ such that the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.\n4.  Therefore, for this choice of $X$ and $x$, the remainder has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n5.  Since no metric continuum can have more than $2^{\\aleph_0}$ points, it cannot have more than $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. Thus, $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the maximum possible number.\n\nThe cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is often denoted by $c$.\n\n<<<$2^{\\aleph_0}$>>>"
