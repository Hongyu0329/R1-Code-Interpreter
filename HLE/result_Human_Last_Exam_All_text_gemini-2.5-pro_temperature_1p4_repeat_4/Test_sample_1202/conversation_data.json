    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the most probable mechanism that explains two key outcomes for genes that have been duplicated in a genome:\n1.  **Retention:** Why is the second copy of the gene not immediately lost or silenced? Since it's initially redundant, there's no selective pressure to keep it, and it could be lost through mutation (pseudogenization). A successful mechanism must explain how the duplicate copy is preserved.\n2.  **Divergence:** Why do the two copies of the gene become different from each other over evolutionary time? A successful mechanism must explain the selective pressures or processes that drive changes in the gene sequences.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. The result is that the two gene copies become more similar or identical. This process actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, it cannot be the primary mechanism for both retention and divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one of the duplicate genes accumulates inactivating mutations and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene.\" While this is a very common *fate* for duplicate genes and involves divergence (the pseudogene's sequence changes), it is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not gene *retention* in a functional sense. The question asks for a mechanism that retains both copies.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original, essential function, while the other copy is free to accumulate mutations. One of these mutations might eventually confer a new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies are retained because one performs the original function and the other performs a new, advantageous function.\n    *   **Divergence:** The accumulation of mutations to create the new function is the definition of divergence.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The main challenge for this model is the initial phase. The new copy is redundant and has no function, making it invisible to positive selection and very likely to be lost via pseudogenization before a rare, beneficial mutation can occur.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model assumes the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., active in multiple tissues). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that inactivate *different* subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function B, and copy 2 loses function A. Now, both copies are required to perform the complete original set of functions.\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies become essential to carry out the ancestral functions. There is strong purifying selection to keep both.\n    *   **Divergence:** The degenerative mutations and subsequent optimization for their specialized roles cause the sequences and regulatory regions of the two genes to diverge.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This model provides a very strong explanation for the initial retention of duplicate genes. By partitioning the ancestral function, both copies are quickly preserved from loss by purifying selection, giving them a \"safe harbor\" to exist long enough to diverge further.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species. Gene duplication is a key genetic process that can provide the raw material for such radiation, but adaptive radiation itself is not a *molecular mechanism* that acts on a pair of duplicate genes. It describes a consequence, not the underlying cause at the gene level.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Best Candidates (Neofunctionalization vs. Subfunctionalization)**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models that explain both retention and divergence. However, the question asks for the *most likely* mechanism. The initial preservation of a new, redundant gene is a significant hurdle. Subfunctionalization provides a more robust and passive mechanism for overcoming this hurdle. The complementary loss of function can happen neutrally, but it quickly makes both gene copies essential, protecting them from being lost. Neofunctionalization requires a rare beneficial mutation to occur before the gene is lost, which is considered a less probable event. For this reason, many evolutionary biologists believe subfunctionalization is a more common initial pathway for the preservation of duplicate genes, creating the conditions where neofunctionalization might later occur.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSubfunctionalization offers the most plausible and frequent explanation for how duplicate genes are initially retained, thereby allowing them the time to diverge. It directly addresses the problem of preserving a redundant gene from the high likelihood of pseudogenization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
