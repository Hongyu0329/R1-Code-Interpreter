    "This is a classic problem in point-set topology. Let's analyze it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are given two sets, let's call them A and B, with the following properties:\n1.  They are subsets of the plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n2.  They are **closed** sets.\n3.  They are **connected** sets.\n4.  Their union is the unit square, $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible number of connected components of their intersection, $A \\cap B$.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Analysis and Simple Cases\nLet's consider some simple ways to form the square as a union of two closed, connected sets.\n\n*   **Case 1: Half-squares.** Let $A = [0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$ and $B = [1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$. Both are closed and connected, and their union is the square. Their intersection is the line segment $\\{1/2\\} \\times [0, 1]$, which has **1** connected component.\n\n*   **Case 2: Interlocking strips.** Let's define three horizontal strips:\n    *   $S_1 = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1/3]$\n    *   $S_2 = [0, 1] \\times [1/3, 2/3]$\n    *   $S_3 = [0, 1] \\times [2/3, 1]$\n    Let's construct A and B to be connected.\n    *   Let $A = S_1 \\cup S_3 \\cup (\\{0\\} \\times [0, 1])$. This is the union of the top and bottom strips, connected by the left edge of the square. This set is closed and connected.\n    *   Let $B = S_2$. This set is also closed and connected.\n    Their union is $A \\cup B = S$. Their intersection is $A \\cap B = ([0, 1] \\times \\{1/3\\}) \\cup ([0, 1] \\times \\{2/3\\}) \\cup (\\{0\\} \\times [1/3, 2/3])$. This intersection is a single U-shaped connected set. It has **1** component.\n\nThese simple examples might lead one to believe the answer is 1.\n\n### Step 3: A Deeper Look with Topology\nThere is a well-known theorem in topology that states:\n*   *Theorem (flawed version):* If A and B are connected closed subsets of a connected space X such that $X = A \\cup B$, then $A \\cap B$ is connected.\n\nIf this theorem were true without any other conditions, the answer to the question would be 1. This theorem can also be seemingly \"proven\" using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology, which relates the homology groups of A, B, $A \\cup B$, and $A \\cap B$. Applying this sequence for 0-th homology (which counts components) strongly suggests that the intersection must be connected.\n\n### Step 4: The Crucial Point - Local Connectedness\nThe catch is that the theorem mentioned above, and the standard application of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, have a subtle but crucial hidden assumption: they work for spaces that are \"nice enough\", specifically, spaces that are **locally connected**.\n\n*   A space is **locally connected** if every point has a basis of connected open neighborhoods. The unit square is locally connected. However, the subsets A and B are only required to be closed and connected; they are not required to be locally connected.\n\nIt turns out that there exist closed, connected sets in the plane that are not locally connected. The most famous example is the **Topologist's Sine Curve**. By using such \"pathological\" sets, it's possible to construct A and B satisfying the problem's conditions but yielding an intersection with more than one component.\n\n### Step 5: Construction of Counterexamples\nThe construction of such sets A and B is non-trivial and is a classic topic in advanced topology, related to so-called \"indecomposable continua\" and the \"Lakes of Wada\" phenomenon.\n\n1.  It was shown by mathematicians that it is possible to construct two closed, connected sets A and B whose union is the unit disk (or square) and whose intersection has **two** components.\n2.  This result was generalized. In a 2010 paper, C. Hoghton and J. van Mill demonstrated a construction that, for **any integer n â‰¥ 1**, produces two closed connected subsets of the unit disk, $A_n$ and $B_n$, such that their union is the disk and their intersection has exactly **n** components.\n3.  Furthermore, they showed it is possible to construct sets A and B whose intersection has **infinitely many** components.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nSince it is possible to construct examples where the intersection has *n* components for any arbitrary integer *n*, there is no largest integer that can be the number of components. Therefore, there is no finite maximum. The question asks for the \"largest number\", which in this context means the supremum of all possible numbers of components. Since this set of numbers is $\\{1, 2, 3, ...\\} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$, the largest possible value is infinity.\n\nThe simple analysis and standard theorems are misleading because they don't account for the existence of connected sets that are not locally connected, which have very complex topological properties.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
