    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a concept extending the idea of a fixed point to a system of three functions and three variables. The conditions for its existence are derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to a suitable operator on a product space.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the conditions under which three functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`, have a \"tripled fixed point\". The function signatures provided are `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and a typo `G:Z*Y*X→Z`, which we will assume should be `H:Z*Y*X→Z`.\n\nA tripled fixed point is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` from the spaces `X, Y, Z` respectively, that remain unchanged when the functions are applied. Based on the function signatures, this means finding an `(x, y, z)` such that:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(...) = y`\n3.  `H(...) = z`\n\nThe structure of the arguments in `G` and `H` is crucial. The signatures `G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `H:Z*Y*X→Z` are somewhat asymmetric. In the literature on coupled and tripled fixed points, a cyclically symmetric structure is standard because it arises naturally in many applications. It is highly probable that the intended structure was symmetric:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × Z × X → Y`\n*   `H: Z × X × Y → Z`\n\nWith this standard structure, a tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is a solution to the system:\n*   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n*   `G(y, z, x) = y`\n*   `H(z, x, y) = z`\n\nOur analysis will proceed based on this standard, symmetric interpretation. The core method involves defining an operator on the product space `X × Y × Z` and finding conditions under which this operator is a contraction mapping.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Metric Spaces:** The theory of fixed points is grounded in metric spaces. We must assume that `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are not just sets, but **complete metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n2.  **Product Space:** We will work in the Cartesian product space `M = X × Y × Z`. This space must also be a complete metric space. If `X, Y, Z` are complete, `M` is complete under standard metrics. We will use the sum metric:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n3.  **Operator Definition:** The existence of the tripled fixed point is equivalent to the existence of a fixed point for a single operator `T: M → M`. The correct definition of this operator is key.\n4.  **Contraction Condition:** The conditions on `F`, `G`, and `H` must be strong enough to make the combined operator `T` a contraction mapping, which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n---\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Conditions\n\n**Step 1: Define the Operator and the Fixed Point Problem**\n\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces.\n*   Let the product space be `M = X × Y × Z` with the sum metric `d`.\n*   We define an operator `T: M → M` based on the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, z, x), H(z, x, y))`\n*   A point `p = (x, y, z)` is a fixed point of `T` if `T(p) = p`. This is equivalent to the system of equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, z, x) = y`\n    *   `H(z, x, y) = z`\n*   Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding conditions under which the operator `T` has a unique fixed point.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point. `T` is a contraction mapping if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `p₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `M`:\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d(p₁, p₂)`\n\n**Step 3: Establish Contractive Conditions on F, G, and H**\n\nTo make `T` a contraction, we impose separate contractive (Lipschitz-like) conditions on each of the component functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. We assume there exist nine non-negative constants (`α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι`) such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n\n1.  For `F: X × Y × Z → X`:\n    `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α·d_X(x₁, x₂) + β·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  For `G: Y × Z × X → Y`:\n    `d_Y(G(y₁, z₁, x₁), G(y₂, z₂, x₂)) ≤ δ·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + ε·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + ζ·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n3.  For `H: Z × X × Y → Z`:\n    `d_Z(H(z₁, x₁, y₁), H(z₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ η·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + θ·d_X(x₁, x₂) + ι·d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Conditions to Prove T is a Contraction**\n\nNow, we sum these three inequalities to analyze the distance `d(T(p₁), T(p₂))`.\n\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) = d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,z₁,x₁), G(y₂,z₂,x₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,x₁,y₁), H(z₂,x₂,y₂))`\n\nSubstituting the bounds from Step 3:\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α·d_X(x₁,x₂) + β·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + γ·d_Z(z₁,z₂)) + (δ·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + ε·d_Z(z₁,z₂) + ζ·d_X(x₁,x₂)) + (η·d_Z(z₁,z₂) + θ·d_X(x₁,x₂) + ι·d_Y(y₁,y₂))`\n\nGroup the terms by `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α + ζ + θ)·d_X(x₁,x₂) + (β + δ + ι)·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (γ + ε + η)·d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nTo satisfy the contraction `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d(p₁, p₂)` where `d(p₁, p₂) = d_X + d_Y + d_Z`, we need a single constant `k < 1` that bounds the coefficients. Let:\n*   `k_x = α + ζ + θ`\n*   `k_y = β + δ + ι`\n*   `k_z = γ + ε + η`\n\nThe inequality becomes:\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k_x·d_X(x₁,x₂) + k_y·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + k_z·d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nLet `k = max(k_x, k_y, k_z)`. Then:\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k·d_X(x₁,x₂) + k·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + k·d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))`\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d(p₁, p₂)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we must have `k < 1`. Therefore, the final condition on the constants is:\n`max(α + ζ + θ,  β + δ + ι,  γ + ε + η) < 1`\n\n---\n### Final Answer: Summary of Conditions\n\nFor the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×Z×X→Y`, and `H:Z×X×Y→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point, the following conditions are sufficient:\n\n1.  **Space Requirement:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **Contractive Mappings:** There must exist nine non-negative constants `α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α·d_X(x₁, x₂) + β·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, z₁, x₁), G(y₂, z₂, x₂)) ≤ δ·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + ε·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + ζ·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, x₁, y₁), H(z₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ η·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + θ·d_X(x₁, x₂) + ι·d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n\n3.  **Overall Contraction Condition:** The sum of the constants must satisfy the following strict inequality:\n    `max(α + ζ + θ,  β + δ + ι,  γ + ε + η) < 1`\n\nUnder these conditions, there exists a unique triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z` such that `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, z, x) = y`, and `H(z, x, y) = z`.\n\n<<<The conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  **(Completeness of Spaces):** The domains X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z` respectively.\n2.  **(Individual Contraction Conditions):** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy mixed Lipschitz-type conditions. Assuming a standard symmetric definition of the fixed point (`F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,z,x)=y`, `H(z,x,y)=z`), there must exist nine non-negative constants (`α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι`) such that for all `x_i ∈ X, y_i ∈ Y, z_i ∈ Z`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α·d_X(x₁, x₂) + β·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, z₁, x₁), G(y₂, z₂, x₂)) ≤ δ·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + ε·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + ζ·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, x₁, y₁), H(z₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ η·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + θ·d_X(x₁, x₂) + ι·d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n3.  **(Overall Contraction Requirement):** The sum of the relevant constants must be less than 1, ensuring the operator on the product space is a contraction. Specifically, `max(α + ζ + θ,  β + δ + ι,  γ + ε + η) < 1`.>>>"
