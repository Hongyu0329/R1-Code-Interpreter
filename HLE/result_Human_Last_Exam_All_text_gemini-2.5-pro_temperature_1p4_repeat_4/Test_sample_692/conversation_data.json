    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The key elements are: \"earliest known date,\" \"recorded,\" \"pre-Columbian civilization,\" and \"aboriginal writing system.\" This means we are looking for the oldest artifact with a written calendar date that can be assigned a chronological age.\n\n2.  **Identify Candidate Civilizations:** Several pre-Columbian civilizations in Mesoamerica developed writing and calendar systems. The main contenders for the \"earliest\" are the Zapotec, the Olmec/Epi-Olmec, and the Maya.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Evidence:**\n    *   **Olmec (Cascajal Block, ~900 BCE):** This is the earliest evidence of writing in the Americas. However, the block does not contain any recognizable calendar dates, so it does not answer the question.\n    *   **Zapotec (Monument 3, San José Mogote):** This carved stone monument, found in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico, is a crucial piece of evidence. It depicts a slain captive, and between the figure's legs is a glyph representing a day in the 260-day sacred calendar. The glyph is interpreted as **\"1 Earthquake.\"** The monument is archaeologically dated to approximately **600 BCE**.\n    *   **Maya (San Bartolo Murals, ~250 BCE):** In San Bartolo, Guatemala, fragments of a mural were found that are securely dated by radiocarbon methods to between 300 and 200 BCE. One fragment clearly shows the notation **\"7 Deer,\"** a day in the 260-day calendar. This is the earliest *securely* dated calendar notation, but it is chronologically later than the Zapotec example.\n    *   **Epi-Olmec (Tres Zapotes Stela C, ~32 BCE):** This monument from Veracruz, Mexico, contains the earliest known date written in the **Long Count** system, an absolute calendar that counts days from a mythological start date. The date inscribed is 7.16.6.16.18, which correlates to **September 3, 32 BCE**. While this is the earliest *absolute* date that can be precisely fixed, the date itself is significantly more recent than the Zapotec and early Maya examples.\n\n4.  **Compare the Candidates:**\n    *   The date recorded on Tres Zapotes Stela C is 32 BCE.\n    *   The date recorded at San Bartolo pertains to the era it was painted, circa 250 BCE.\n    *   The date recorded on San José Mogote Monument 3 pertains to the era it was carved, circa 600 BCE.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Chronologically, 600 BCE is the earliest of these dates. Therefore, the glyph on San José Mogote Monument 3 represents the earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Type of Date:** The earliest dates (Zapotec and early Maya) are day names within the 260-day ritual calendar, not absolute dates like the Long Count found on Tres Zapotes Stela C.\n*   **Dating Certainty:** While the Zapotec monument's date of ~600 BCE is widely accepted, some scholars note its archaeological context is less secure than the radiocarbon-dated San Bartolo murals. However, even with this caveat, the Zapotec monument is consistently cited as the earliest evidence.\n*   **Writing vs. Dated Writing:** It is important to distinguish the earliest evidence of writing in general (the Cascajal Block) from the earliest evidence of a *recorded date*.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nThe earliest recorded date is the \"1 Earthquake\" glyph on Monument 3 from the Zapotec site of San José Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico. This calendrical glyph was carved around 600 BCE.\n\n<<<The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is the day \"1 Earthquake,\" a glyph from the 260-day calendar inscribed on Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. The monument is dated to approximately 600 BCE.>>>"
