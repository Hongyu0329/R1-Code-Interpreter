    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to determine the transformation rule that converts the input grid into the output grid. We must apply this rule to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`. The input and output are strings where rows of a grid are separated by commas.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Input_A and Output_A**\n\n*   **Input_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    001111\n    121111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    201111\n    101111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   The `2` at position (row 1, col 1) has moved.\n    *   The original position of the `2` becomes a `0`.\n    *   The `2` moves to the position (row 0, col 0), which was originally a `0`.\n    *   The move is from (1, 1) to (0, 0), which is a diagonal move, specifically \"Up-Left\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Input_B and Output_B**\n\n*   **Input_B Grid:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111002111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_B Grid:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000211110\n    1111000111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   The `2` at position (row 3, col 6) has moved.\n    *   Its original position becomes a `0`.\n    *   The `2` moves to position (row 2, col 7), which was originally a `0`.\n    *   The move is from (3, 6) to (2, 7), which is also a diagonal move, specifically \"Up-Right\".\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis**\nThe transformation involves the `2` moving to a new position.\n1.  The `2` only moves to a cell that currently contains a `0`.\n2.  The movement is always to a diagonally adjacent cell.\n3.  The original position of the `2` becomes a `0`.\n\nThe question is, how does it choose which diagonal direction to move in? Let's test the cells around the `2` in each case.\n\n*   **In Case A:** The `2` is at (1,1). Its diagonal neighbors are:\n    *   Up-Left (0,0): Contains `0`.\n    *   Up-Right (0,2): Contains `1`.\n    *   Down-Left (2,0): Contains `1`.\n    *   Down-Right (2,2): Contains `1`.\n    Only one diagonal neighbor is a `0`, so the choice is clear. It moves to (0,0).\n\n*   **In Case B:** The `2` is at (3,6). Its diagonal neighbors are:\n    *   Up-Left (2,5): Contains `0`.\n    *   Up-Right (2,7): Contains `0`.\n    *   Down-Left (4,5): Contains `1`.\n    *   Down-Right (4,7): Contains `1`.\n    Here there are two choices: Up-Left or Up-Right. The output shows it moved Up-Right. This suggests a priority order for checking the directions. Since Up-Right was chosen over Up-Left, we can infer that **Up-Right has a higher priority than Up-Left.**\n\n**Step 5: Define the Transformation Rule**\nThe rule for the transformation is as follows:\n1.  Find the character `2` in the grid.\n2.  Check its four diagonal neighbors in the following priority order:\n    1.  Up-Right (UR)\n    2.  Up-Left (UL)\n    3.  Down-Right (DR)\n    4.  Down-Left (DL)\n3.  The first neighbor found that is within the grid boundaries and contains a `0` becomes the destination.\n4.  The `2` moves to this destination cell. Its original cell becomes a `0`.\n5.  If no diagonal neighbor is a `0`, no change occurs.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the Rule to Input_C**\n\n*   **Input_C Grid:**\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n1.  **Find the '2':** It is at position (row 1, col 4).\n2.  **Check diagonal neighbors in priority order:**\n    *   **Check Up-Right:** The target is (row 1-1, col 4+1) = (0, 5).\n    *   Look at the value at (0, 5) in the input grid. The first row is `000000`. The character at index 5 is `0`.\n    *   We have found a valid destination. We do not need to check any other directions.\n3.  **Perform the transformation:**\n    *   The `2` at (1, 4) becomes a `0`. The second row changes from `011120` to `011100`.\n    *   The `0` at (0, 5) becomes a `2`. The first row changes from `000000` to `000002`.\n    *   The third row `111111` is unchanged.\n4.  **Construct the final output grid:**\n    ```\n    000002\n    011100\n    111111\n    ```\n5.  **Format the output as a string:** `000002,011100,111111`\n\nThe value of `MISSING` is the transformed string.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
