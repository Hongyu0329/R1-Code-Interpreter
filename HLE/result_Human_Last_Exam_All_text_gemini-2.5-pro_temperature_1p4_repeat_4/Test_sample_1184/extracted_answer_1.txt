**1) Hotspots for Interaction (Binding) with the Alpha-1 Subunit:**
The following residues in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the human beta-1 subunit (isoform b, UniProt P54289-2) form the core of the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) and are critical for direct physical interaction with the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID):
*   **Y284** (Tyrosine at position 284)
*   **L291** (Leucine at position 291)
*   **W381** (Tryptophan at position 381)
*   **V388** (Valine at position 388)
*   **I392** (Isoleucine at position 392)
*   **Y401** (Tyrosine at position 401)
*   **L405** (Leucine at position 405)

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**
The following residues in the human beta-1 subunit are critical for modulating the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit, often without abolishing the primary binding interaction:
*   **For modulating inactivation kinetics (located in the N-terminus):** A cluster of basic residues responsible for slowing channel inactivation.
    *   **K54** (Lysine at position 54)
    *   **R56** (Arginine at position 56)
    *   **R58** (Arginine at position 58)
*   **For modulating voltage-dependent activation (located on the GK domain surface):** Charged residues involved in allosteric communication with the channel's voltage-sensing machinery.
    *   **D393** (Aspartate at position 393)
    *   **K395** (Lysine at position 395)
