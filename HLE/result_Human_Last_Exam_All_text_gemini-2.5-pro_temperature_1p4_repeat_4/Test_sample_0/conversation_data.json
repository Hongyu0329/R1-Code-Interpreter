    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Population Ethics:** This field of philosophy deals with the moral value of different possible future populations. It asks questions like \"Is it better to have a smaller population of very happy people or a larger population of people who are less happy but still have good lives?\"\n    *   **Critical-Level Views:** This is a family of theories in population ethics. They evaluate the goodness of a population by summing up the \"utility\" (or well-being) of each person, but only after subtracting a certain positive value called the \"critical level\" (`c`). The formula is: `Value = Σ(u_i - c)`, where `u_i` is the utility of person `i`. This means adding a person to the world is only good if their utility is above the critical level `c`. If their utility is below `c` (even if it's positive, e.g., a life worth living), adding them makes the population worse.\n    *   **Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem:** This is a famous result by Gustaf Arrhenius which shows that a set of seemingly plausible and desirable conditions for a population axiology (a system for ranking populations) are mutually inconsistent. No theory can satisfy all of them at the same time.\n\n2.  **List the Conditions of the Theorem:**\n    The theorem states that there is no population axiology that can simultaneously satisfy all of the following five conditions:\n    *   **Non-Elitism:** A minimal condition requiring that if two populations have the same number of people, the one that is a Pareto improvement over the other is better. It also includes permutation invariance (shuffling who gets which utility level doesn't change the total value).\n    *   **General Non-Extreme Priority (GNEP):** For any high utility level `u`, it's always possible to find a much larger population with a lower (but still positive) utility level `v` that is better. This prevents the view from being \"elitist\" by claiming that a single very high-quality life is better than any number of slightly lower-quality lives.\n    *   **Egalitarian Dominance:** If population A has a higher average utility, higher total utility, and is more equal than population B, then population A must be better than population B.\n    *   **Weak Quality Addition:** There is at least one positive utility level `u` such that adding a person with that utility level makes the population better.\n    *   **Weak Non-Sadism:** Adding a person with a negative utility level (a life not worth living) cannot make the population better.\n\n3.  **Analyze Critical-Level Views Against Each Condition:**\n    Let's take a critical-level view with a critical level `c > 0`. We will check if it satisfies each condition.\n\n    *   **Weak Non-Sadism:** To violate this, adding a person with negative utility (`u < 0`) would have to make the outcome better. The change in value is `u - c`. Since `u` is negative and `c` is positive, `u - c` is always a negative number. Thus, adding such a person always makes the population worse. **Critical-level views satisfy this condition.**\n\n    *   **Weak Quality Addition:** To satisfy this, there must be *some* positive utility level `u` that improves a population. We need `u - c > 0`, which means `u > c`. Since we can always choose a utility level `u` that is greater than `c` (e.g., `u = c + 1`), this condition is met. **Critical-level views satisfy this condition.**\n\n    *   **Non-Elitism:** The value `Σ(u_i - c)` is indifferent to permutations. For a fixed population size, if `Σu_A > Σu_B`, then `Σ(u_i_A - c) > Σ(u_i_B - c)`. Thus, it respects the Pareto principle for fixed populations. **Critical-level views satisfy this condition.**\n\n    *   **Egalitarian Dominance:** Let's test this with an example. Let the critical level be `c = 5`.\n        *   Population B = {2} (one person with utility 2). Total utility = 2, Average utility = 2.\n        *   Population A = {3, 3} (two people, both with utility 3). Total utility = 6, Average utility = 3.\n        *   Population A has higher total utility (6 > 2), higher average utility (3 > 2), and is perfectly equal (as is B). According to Egalitarian Dominance, A must be better than B.\n        *   Let's calculate the value using the critical-level view:\n            *   Value(B) = (2 - 5) = -3\n            *   Value(A) = (3 - 5) + (3 - 5) = -2 + -2 = -4\n        *   The critical-level view says that B is better than A (-3 > -4). This is a direct contradiction of the condition. **Critical-level views violate Egalitarian Dominance.**\n\n    *   **General Non-Extreme Priority (GNEP):** This condition states that for any utility level `u`, we can find a lower level `v` such that some large number (`n`) of lives at `v` is better than one life at `u`. Let's test this.\n        *   Let the critical level be `c = 10`.\n        *   Choose a high utility level `u = 11` (which is above `c`). A population with one person at this level has a value of `V = 11 - 10 = 1`.\n        *   Now choose a lower utility level `v = 9` (which is below `c`). The condition says there must be some number `n` of people at level 9 that is better.\n        *   Let's calculate the value of `n` people at level 9: `V = n * (9 - 10) = n * (-1) = -n`.\n        *   Can we find an `n` such that `-n` is better than `1`? This is impossible; `-n` will always be negative and thus worse than `1`.\n        *   Because the critical level creates a sharp dividing line, any number of people below it can have a large negative value, which can never be better than even one person just above it. This directly contradicts the principle of non-extreme priority. **Critical-level views violate General Non-Extreme Priority.**\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Critical-level views violate both Egalitarian Dominance and General Non-Extreme Priority. However, the violation of GNEP is arguably more fundamental and characteristic of the theory. The very purpose of a critical level is to create a threshold, which inherently rejects the smooth trade-offs between quality and quantity that GNEP demands. The conflict between a sharp \"critical level\" and a principle named \"Non-Extreme Priority\" is direct. The violation of GNEP is often cited as the primary theoretical drawback of critical-level views.\n\n<<<B>>>"
