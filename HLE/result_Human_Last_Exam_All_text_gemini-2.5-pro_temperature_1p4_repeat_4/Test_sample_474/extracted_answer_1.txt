No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry syndromes in bumblebees is to provide a recognizable warning signal to their natural predators, which are primarily birds. Bird vision is fundamentally different from human vision; notably, birds are tetrachromats and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Since the color patterns of bees often include UV reflectance, two species that appear identical to a human may look distinctly different to a bird. Therefore, using human undergraduates to judge visual similarity is not a valid proxy for how predators perceive the bees. The resulting clusters would be based on human sensory perception and may not represent the true, functional mimicry rings that have evolved under natural selection from predators.
