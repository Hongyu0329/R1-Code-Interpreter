    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\n*   **The setting:** \"the wide boulevards of Vienna\". This immediately brings to mind large, spacious avenues like the Ringstrasse. The key concept here is **width** and **size**.\n*   **The subject:** \"the surname of an English poet\". The answer will be a specific surname, like Shakespeare, Byron, Shelley, etc.\n*   **The key mechanism:** \"In the Russian translation of a certain essay\". This is the most critical part of the question. It tells us that the connection between the poet's name and the boulevards is not in English, but is a linguistic feature of the **Russian language**. This strongly suggests a pun or wordplay that works in Russian.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Central Problem**\n\nWe are looking for an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, sounds like a Russian word related to the concept of being very large or wide. This word would be used metaphorically or humorously to describe the vastness of Vienna's boulevards.\n\n**Step 3: Brainstorm and Test Potential Surnames**\n\nLet's consider some famous English poets and see how their names sound in Russian and if they create a pun related to size.\n\n*   Byron -> Байрон (Bayron) -> No obvious pun related to size.\n*   Shelley -> Шелли (Shelli) -> No obvious pun related to size.\n*   Wordsworth -> Вордсворт (Vordsvort) -> No obvious pun related to size.\n*   **Keats** -> **Китс (Kits)** -> This is a very strong candidate.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Pun**\n\n*   The English surname is **Keats**.\n*   The Russian transliteration is **Китс (Kits)**.\n*   This sounds almost identical to the Russian word **кит (kit)**, which means **whale**.\n*   A whale is a symbol of immense size.\n*   The connection becomes clear: A Russian observer, struck by the width of the Viennese boulevards, might exclaim something like, \"These streets are so wide, you could turn a whale around in them!\" The literary pun replaces the word \"whale\" with the poet's name, creating a witty remark: \"These boulevards are so spacious, even the poet **Keats (Китс)** could find his place here!\" The humor lies in the double meaning.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\n\nThe puzzle relies on a famous pun in Russian literary circles. The description of Vienna's wide boulevards evokes the idea of a massive space. The Russian word for \"whale\" is \"кит\" (kit). The English Romantic poet John Keats's surname is transliterated into Russian as \"Китс\" (Kits). Therefore, his surname is used in a witticism to describe the boulevards' immense size. The surname, in its original English form, is Keats.\n\n<<<Keats>>>"
