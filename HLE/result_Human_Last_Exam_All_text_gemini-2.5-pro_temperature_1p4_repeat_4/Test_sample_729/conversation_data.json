    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Generalized Quaternion Group $Q_{128}$**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor the group of size 128, we have $4n=128$, so $n=32$. The group is $Q_{128}$ with the presentation:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nThe elements of this group are of two forms:\n1.  Powers of $x$: $x^j$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, 63$. There are 64 such elements. The order of $x$ is 64.\n2.  Elements of the form $x^j y$: $x^j y$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, 63$. There are 64 such elements.\n\n### **Step 2: Defining \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is not universally standard, but in specialized literature, it refers to a subgroup generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements of the group for some integer $k$.\nSpecifically, a subgroup $H \\le G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k \\ge 1$ such that $H$ is the subgroup generated by the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. We denote this subgroup by $G_k$:\n$G_k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way for $G = Q_{128}$.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the $k$-th Powers of Elements in $Q_{128}$**\n\nWe need to compute $g^k$ for an arbitrary element $g \\in Q_{128}$.\n\n*   **If $g = x^j$**: $g^k = (x^j)^k = x^{jk}$.\n*   **If $g = x^j y$**: We first compute the square of this element.\n    $(x^j y)^2 = x^j y x^j y = x^j (y x^j y^{-1}) y^2 = x^j (x^{-j}) y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    Now we can find $g^k$:\n    *   If $k$ is even, say $k = 2m$: $(x^j y)^k = ((x^j y)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\n    *   If $k$ is odd, say $k = 2m+1$: $(x^j y)^k = (x^j y)^{2m}(x^j y) = x^{32m} x^j y = x^{j+32m} y$.\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Power Subgroups $G_k$**\n\nWe now determine the subgroup $G_k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ generated by these powers. It is natural to analyze this based on the parity of $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is odd**\nLet $k = 2m+1$ for some integer $m \\ge 0$.\nThe set of generators for $G_k$ is $\\{x^{jk} \\mid j \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} \\cup \\{x^{j+32m}y \\mid j \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n1.  Consider the generators of the form $x^{jk}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. The subgroup generated by $\\{x^{jk} \\mid j=0,\\dots,63\\}$ is $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k,64)} \\rangle = \\langle x^1 \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$. So, the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a subset of $G_k$.\n2.  The set of generators for $G_k$ also includes elements of the form $x^a y$. For example, for $j=0$, we have the generator $x^{32m}y$. Also, $y$ itself is a generator (take $j=-32m$).\n3.  Since $G_k$ contains the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ and the element $y$, it must contain all elements of the form $x^j$ and $y x^j = x^{-j} y$, thus $G_k$ contains all elements of $Q_{128}$.\nSo, for any odd integer $k$, the power subgroup is $G_k = Q_{128}$. This gives us **one** distinct power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is even**\nLet $k = 2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$.\nThe set of generators for $G_k$ is $\\{x^{jk} \\mid j \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} \\cup \\{x^{32m} \\mid j \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n1.  The subgroup generated by $\\{x^{jk}\\}$ is $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n2.  The other generators are of the form $x^{32m} = x^{16k}$.\n3.  The full set of generators is $\\{x^{jk}, x^{16k}\\}$. The subgroup they generate is $G_k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k,64)}, x^{16k} \\rangle$.\n4.  Since $16k$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(k,64)$, the element $x^{16k}$ is already in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k,64)} \\rangle$.\n5.  Therefore, for any even $k$, $G_k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n### **Step 5: Counting the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nWe need to count the number of distinct subgroups obtained from both cases.\n\n*   From Case 1 (odd $k$), we get one subgroup: $Q_{128}$.\n\n*   From Case 2 (even $k$), the subgroups are of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ for some even integer $k$.\n    *   Let $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$. Since $k$ is even, $k=2j$ for some integer $j$. This implies $d = \\gcd(2j, 64)$ must be divisible by $\\gcd(2, 64) = 2$. So, $d$ must be an even number.\n    *   Also, $d$ must be a divisor of 64. The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n    *   The possible values for $d$ are the even divisors of 64: $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n    *   For each such even divisor $d$, we can find an even integer $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, 64) = d$. For instance, we can choose $k=d$. Since $d$ is an even divisor of 64, $\\gcd(d, 64) = d$.\n    *   This gives us 6 distinct subgroups:\n        1.  $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n        2.  $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n        3.  $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n        4.  $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n        5.  $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n        6.  $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nThese 6 subgroups are distinct from each other and also distinct from the subgroup $Q_{128}$ found in Case 1 (as they are all proper cyclic subgroups).\n\n### **Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases.\n*   Number of subgroups for odd $k$: 1 (which is $Q_{128}$)\n*   Number of subgroups for even $k$: 6 (which are $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle x^{64} \\rangle$)\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $1 + 6 = 7$."
