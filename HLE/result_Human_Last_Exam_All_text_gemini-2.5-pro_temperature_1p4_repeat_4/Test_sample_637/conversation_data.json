    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer gain matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to design a state observer for the given discrete-time system:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nThe observer should be a \"deadbeat\" observer, meaning the observation error, `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`, must converge to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is achieved by designing an observer gain matrix `L` such that the observer error dynamics matrix, `A_cl = A - LC`, has all its eigenvalues at the origin (`λ=0`). Furthermore, to achieve convergence in the *shortest* time, the nilpotency index of `A - LC` should be minimized. This minimum time is equal to the observability index of the system.\n\nThe observer dynamics are given by:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))`\nThe error dynamics are:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\n### Step 2: Check System Observability\nBefore designing the observer, we must confirm that the system is observable. A system is observable if the observability matrix `O` has full column rank (rank `n`, where `n` is the dimension of the state vector `x`). Here, `n=4`.\n\nThe observability matrix is `O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`. We need to find the smallest integer `p` (the observability index) such that `rank([C; CA; ...; CA^(p-1)]) = 4`.\n\nGiven matrices:\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`, `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\n*   `C` is a 2x4 matrix. `rank(C) = 2`.\n*   `CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n*   The matrix `[C; CA]` is `[1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`. All rows have a zero in the second column except for the last row. By performing row operations, we can show that `rank([C; CA]) = 3`.\n*   `A^2 = [0 0 1 -2; -3 0 2 -1; 2 0 -1 3; 1 1 -1 -3]`\n*   `CA^2 = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * A^2 = [0 0 1 -2; 1 1 0 -5]`\n*   The second row of `CA^2`, `[1 1 0 -5]`, has a non-zero element in the second column. This row is linearly independent of the rows in `[C; CA]`. Therefore, `rank([C; CA; CA^2]) = 4`.\n\nThe observability index is `p = 3`. The system is observable, and an observer can be designed to make the error zero in 3 steps. This means we need to find `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`. This is accomplished by designing the minimal polynomial of `(A-LC)` to be `λ^3`.\n\n### Step 3: Duality Principle\nThe problem of finding `L` to place the eigenvalues of `A - LC` at desired locations is the dual of the controller pole placement problem. We can find a state-feedback gain `K` for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` that places its poles at the desired locations. The observer gain `L` is then `L = K^T`.\n\nThe dual system is:\n`x_d(k + 1) = A_d x_d(k) + B_d u_d(k)`\nwhere `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n\nWe need to find a gain `K` such that the closed-loop system matrix for the dual system, `A_cl_d = A_d - B_d K`, has all its eigenvalues at `λ=0` and a minimal polynomial of `λ^3`.\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Dual Problem\nThe dual system matrices are:\n`A_d = A^T = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n`B_d = C^T = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]`\n\nLet the gain matrix `K` be `K = [k11 k12 k13 k14; k21 k22 k23 k24]`.\n`B_d K = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1] * [k11 k12 k13 k14; k21 k22 k23 k24] = [k11+k21 k12+k22 k13+k23 k14+k24; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; k21 k22 k23 k24]`\n\nThe closed-loop matrix is `A_cl_d = A_d - B_d K`:\n`A_cl_d = `\n`[-1-(k11+k21)  1-(k12+k22)  -(k13+k23) -1-(k14+k24)]`\n`[      0             0            1            0      ]`\n`[      0             0            0            1      ]`\n`[  1-k21         2-k22       -1-k23       -1-k24     ]`\n\nTo simplify finding the characteristic polynomial `det(λI - A_cl_d)`, we can choose `K` to make one column of `A_cl_d` zero. Let's make the first column zero:\n1.  `1 - k21 = 0  => k21 = 1`\n2.  `-1 - (k11 + k21) = 0 => -1 - (k11 + 1) = 0 => k11 = -2`\n\nNow the matrix `A_cl_d` is:\n`A_cl_d = `\n`[   0    1-(k12+k22)  -(k13+k23) -1-(k14+k24)]`\n`[   0         0            1            0      ]`\n`[   0         0            0            1      ]`\n`[   0       2-k22       -1-k23       -1-k24     ]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is `p(λ) = λ * [λ^3 + (1+k24)λ^2 + (1+k23)λ - (2-k22)]`.\nTo place all poles at zero, `p(λ)` must be `λ^4`. This means the polynomial in the brackets must be `λ^3`. By comparing coefficients:\n1.  `1 + k24 = 0  => k24 = -1`\n2.  `1 + k23 = 0  => k23 = -1`\n3.  `-(2 - k22) = 0 => k22 = 2`\n\nWe have determined `k11, k21, k22, k23, k24`. The values `k12, k13, k14` are free parameters. These can be used to set the minimal polynomial. Let's substitute the known `k` values into `A_cl_d`:\n`A_cl_d = `\n`[   0    1-k12-2   -k13-(-1)   -1-k14-(-1) ]`\n`[   0         0          1            0       ]`\n`[   0         0          0            1       ]`\n`[   0         2-2      -1-(-1)     -1-(-1)    ]`\n\n`A_cl_d = `\n`[   0    -1-k12     1-k13      -k14   ]`\n`[   0       0          1         0    ]`\n`[   0       0          0         1    ]`\n`[   0       0          0         0    ]`\n\nTo get a nilpotency of 3 (`(A_cl_d)^3 = 0`), the Jordan form of `A_cl_d` should have the largest block of size 3. Let's calculate `(A_cl_d)^2` and `(A_cl_d)^3`:\n`(A_cl_d)^2 = [0 0 -(1+k12) 1-k13; 0 0 0 1; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0]`\n`(A_cl_d)^3 = [0 0 0 -(1+k12); 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0]`\n\nFor `(A_cl_d)^3 = 0`, we need `-(1+k12) = 0`, which gives `k12 = -1`. The remaining parameters `k13` and `k14` are still free; we can set them to 0 for simplicity.\n\nSo, one choice for the gain matrix `K` that satisfies all conditions is:\n`k11 = -2`, `k12 = -1`, `k13 = 0`, `k14 = 0`\n`k21 = 1`,  `k22 = 2`, `k23 = -1`, `k24 = -1`\n`K = [-2 -1 0 0; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Observer Gain L\nThe observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K`:\n`L = K^T`\n`L = [-2 1; -1 2; 0 -1; 0 -1]`\n\nThis gain matrix `L` will place all observer poles at the origin and ensure the observation error converges to zero in 3 steps, the shortest possible time.\n\n<<<[-2 1; -1 2; 0 -1; 0 -1]>>>"
