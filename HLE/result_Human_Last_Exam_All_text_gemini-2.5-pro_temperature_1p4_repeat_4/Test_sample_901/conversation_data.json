    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant Structure**\nThe starting material is **(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane**.\n*   We need to represent this molecule in its most stable chair conformation.\n*   The substituents are a bromine atom at carbon 1 (C1) and a methyl group at carbon 2 (C2).\n*   The stereochemistry is (1S, 2R). Let's determine the relative orientation (cis/trans). For adjacent carbons in a cyclohexane ring, (S,R) or (R,S) configurations indicate a **cis** relationship between the substituents. This means they both point to the same face of the ring (both \"up\" or both \"down\").\n*   To find the most stable conformation, we need to minimize steric strain, which means placing the larger substituent in the equatorial position if possible. The A-value (a measure of steric strain for an axial substituent) is ~1.7 kcal/mol for a methyl group (-CH₃) and ~0.5 kcal/mol for a bromine atom (-Br). Since the methyl group is significantly larger than the bromine atom, the most stable conformation will have the methyl group in the equatorial position.\n*   Given the cis relationship and the preference for an equatorial methyl group, the most stable chair conformation for (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane has the **methyl group equatorial** and the **bromine atom axial**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Type**\nThe reagent is **potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu)** in **tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH)**.\n*   Potassium tert-butoxide is a **strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base**.\n*   The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide.\n*   These conditions are ideal for an **E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction**.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reactions**\nA key requirement for an E2 reaction in a cyclohexane ring is that the leaving group (the bromine atom) and the proton being removed must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. This translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (one axial-up, the other axial-down).\n*   From Step 1, we established that in the most stable (and therefore reactive) conformation, the **bromine atom is axial**. This conformation is perfectly set up for an E2 reaction.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Possible Elimination Pathways**\nWe need to find beta-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to C1) that are in an axial position, trans to the axial bromine. The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Deprotonation at C2):**\n    *   On C2, the methyl group is equatorial. Therefore, the hydrogen atom on C2 is **axial**.\n    *   This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n    *   Elimination via this pathway would form a double bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   The product would be **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a **trisubstituted** alkene (more substituted). This is known as the **Zaitsev product**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Deprotonation at C6):**\n    *   On C6, there are two hydrogen atoms. One is equatorial and one is **axial**.\n    *   This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n    *   Elimination via this pathway would form a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group remains on C2.\n    *   The product would be **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a **disubstituted** alkene (less substituted). This is known as the **Hofmann product**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Major Product (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann)**\nSince both pathways are stereochemically possible from the most stable conformer, the major product is determined by the reaction conditions, specifically the nature of the base.\n\n*   **Zaitsev's Rule** states that the more substituted (more stable) alkene will be the major product. This would favor 1-methylcyclohexene.\n*   **Hofmann's Rule** applies when a bulky base is used. A bulky base, like potassium tert-butoxide, preferentially removes the most sterically accessible proton.\n*   Let's compare the steric accessibility of the two axial protons:\n    *   The proton on C6 is part of a -CH₂- group.\n    *   The proton on C2 is on a carbon that also has a methyl group.\n    *   The proton on C6 is considered more sterically accessible (less hindered) than the proton on C2.\n*   Because potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base, it will react faster with the less hindered proton at C6. Therefore, the reaction will favor the Hofmann pathway.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe major product of the reaction is the Hofmann product, which is formed by removing the proton from C6. This product is named **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
