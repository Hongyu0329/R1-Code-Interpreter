    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the etymological development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂g-iyeti*.\n\n**Analysis of the PIE form:**\n\n*   **Root:** *seh₂g-* meaning 'to track, seek out'.\n*   **Laryngeal:** The laryngeal consonant *h₂* colors an adjacent *e*-grade vowel to an *a*-grade vowel. Therefore, *seh₂g-* becomes *sāg-*. This is supported by the provided Latin cognate *sāgīre*.\n*   **Suffix:** *-yeti* is a 3rd person singular present indicative suffix. This type of formation typically leads to Class I weak verbs in Germanic languages.\n\n**Step 1: From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n1.  **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Sound Shift):** This law describes a chain shift of stop consonants. For this root, the relevant change is that the PIE voiced velar stop *g* becomes a voiceless velar stop *k* in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   PIE *g* > PGmc *k*.\n2.  **Vowel Shift:** Proto-Indo-European long *ā* (from *eh₂) becomes Proto-Germanic long *ō*.\n    *   PIE *ā* > PGmc *ō*.\n3.  **Stem Formation:** Combining these changes, the PIE stem *sāg-* develops into the PGmc stem *sōk-*.\n4.  **Verb Class:** The PIE present suffix *-ye/o-* leads to the PGmc Class I weak verb infinitive suffix *-janą*.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** The infinitive form is reconstructed as **\\*sōkjaną**.\n\n**Step 2: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The /j/ (yod) in the suffix *-janą* triggers a process called i-umlaut, fronting the back vowel of the root. The PGmc long vowel *ō* is fronted to the long front rounded vowel *œ̄*.\n2.  **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* simplifies to ON *-a*. The /j/ is typically retained in the orthography for this class of verbs.\n\n*   **Old Norse Result:** The infinitive form is **sœkja**.\n\n**Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the /j/ causes i-umlaut. In Old English, PGmc *ō* is fronted and unrounded to become the long front vowel *ē*.\n2.  **Palatalization:** The PGmc velar consonant *k* becomes palatalized to the affricate /tʃ/ (written as *ċ*) when it comes before a front vowel, such as the newly formed *ē*. The /j/ is absorbed after causing these changes.\n3.  **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* becomes OE *-an*.\n\n*   **Old English Result:** The infinitive form is **sēċan** (meaning \"to seek\").\n\n**Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **Vowel Shift:** PGmc *ō* undergoes a regular shift in Old High German, becoming the diphthong *uo*. Although i-umlaut was an active process, its effect on *uo* (to *üe*) is not consistently shown in the spelling for this verb.\n2.  **West Germanic Gemination:** In West Germanic languages (including OHG and OE), the /j/ of the suffix caused the doubling (gemination) of a preceding single consonant. Thus, PGmc *k* becomes *kk*.\n3.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This shift affects consonants in High German dialects. The newly geminated *kk* is shifted to the long voiceless fricative *hh*, pronounced /xx/ (like the \"ch\" in Scottish \"loch\").\n4.  **Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending *-janą* becomes OHG *-an* (often written *-en*).\n\n*   **Old High German Result:** The infinitive form is **suohhen** (meaning \"to seek, visit\").\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** \\*sōkjaną\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkja\n*   **Old English:** sēċan\n*   **Old High German:** suohhen\n\n<<<\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** \\*sōkjaną\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkja\n*   **Old English:** sēċan\n*   **Old High German:** suohhen\n>>>"
