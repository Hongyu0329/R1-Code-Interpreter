    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the group in question.\nThe group is the semidihedral group of size 512.\nThe semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted as $SD_{2^n}$, is defined for $n \\ge 3$. The order is given as 512, which is $2^9$. So, we are dealing with the group $SD_{2^9}$, which we'll call $G$.\nThe standard presentation for $SD_{2^n}$ (for $n \\ge 4$) is:\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\nFor our case, $n=9$, so the group is:\n$G = SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^7-1} \\rangle$\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\nThe group $G$ has order $2 \\times 256 = 512$. It consists of $256$ elements of the form $r^i$ and $256$ elements of the form $sr^i$. The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256.\n\n### Step 2: Define \"power subgroup\".\nA power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup of the form $G^m = \\langle g^m \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some integer $m$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the relevant values of *m*.\nThe group $G$ is a 2-group, meaning the order of every element is a power of 2. Let the order of an element $g$ be $2^k$. If we write an integer $m$ as $m = 2^j \\cdot q$ where $q$ is odd, then $g^m = g^{2^j q} = (g^{2^j})^q$. The order of $g^{2^j}$ is a power of 2, so raising it to an odd power $q$ does not change the subgroup it generates within a cyclic group of order $2^k$.\nMore formally, the map $x \\mapsto x^q$ is an automorphism of any finite 2-group when $q$ is odd. This means the set $\\{g^q \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is the same as the set $G$.\nTherefore, $G^m = G^{2^j q} = \\langle (g^q)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = \\langle h^{2^j} \\mid h \\in G \\rangle = G^{2^j}$.\nThis shows that the set of power subgroups is determined solely by the powers of 2. We only need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the sequence $G^{2^k}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the power subgroups $G^{2^k}$.\nTo find the generators for $G^{2^k}$, we must compute the $2^k$-th power of every element in $G$. The elements are of two types: $r^i$ and $sr^j$.\n\n*   **For k=0:** $G^{2^0} = G^1 = \\langle g^1 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = G = SD_{512}$. This is our first power subgroup.\n\n*   **For k=1:** $G^2 = \\langle g^2 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements of the form $r^i$, their squares are $(r^i)^2 = r^{2i}$. These elements generate the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements of the form $sr^j$, we find their squares: $(sr^j)^2 = sr^j s r^j = s(r^j s) r^j$. From the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can deduce $srs^{-1} = r^{127}$, and since $s=s^{-1}$, $srs=r^{127}$. It follows that $sr^j s = (srs)^j = (r^{127})^j = r^{127j}$.\n      So, $(sr^j)^2 = (sr^j s)r^j = r^{127j} r^j = r^{128j}$.\n    *   The set of these squares is $\\{r^{128j} \\mid 0 \\le j < 256\\}$. If $j$ is even ($j=2k$), $r^{128(2k)} = r^{256k} = e$. If $j$ is odd ($j=2k+1$), $r^{128(2k+1)} = r^{256k+128} = r^{128}$.\n    *   So, the generators of $G^2$ are the elements of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ and the element $r^{128}$. Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, the element $r^{128}$ is already in $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   Thus, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/2 = 128$. It is distinct from $G$.\n\n*   **For k=2:** $G^4 = \\langle g^4 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements $r^i$, their 4th powers are $(r^i)^4 = r^{4i}$, which generate $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements $sr^j$, we compute their 4th powers: $(sr^j)^4 = ((sr^j)^2)^2 = (r^{128j})^2 = r^{256j} = e$.\n    *   So, the elements $sr^j$ only contribute the identity element.\n    *   Therefore, $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/4 = 64$. It is distinct from $G$ and $G^2$.\n\n*   **For k â‰¥ 2:** $G^{2^k} = \\langle g^{2^k} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements $r^i$, their $2^k$-th powers generate $\\langle r^{2^k} \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements $sr^j$, their $2^k$-th power is $(sr^j)^{2^k} = ((sr^j)^4)^{2^{k-2}} = e^{2^{k-2}} = e$ (since $k \\ge 2$).\n    *   Thus, for any $k \\ge 2$, $G^{2^k} = \\langle r^{2^k} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 5: List and count the distinct power subgroups.\nWe generate the sequence of subgroups until we reach the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n1.  $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G = SD_{512}$. This is a non-abelian group of order 512.\n2.  $G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. Cyclic, order 128.\n3.  $G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. Cyclic, order 64.\n4.  $G^{2^3} = G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$. Cyclic, order 32.\n5.  $G^{2^4} = G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$. Cyclic, order 16.\n6.  $G^{2^5} = G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$. Cyclic, order 8.\n7.  $G^{2^6} = G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$. Cyclic, order 4.\n8.  $G^{2^7} = G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. Cyclic, order 2.\n9.  $G^{2^8} = G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\langle e \\rangle = \\{e\\}$. Cyclic, order 1.\n\nFor any $k > 8$, $G^{2^k}$ will also be the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\nWe need to count how many of these subgroups are distinct.\nThe first subgroup, $G$, is non-abelian of order 512. The other 8 subgroups are cyclic subgroups of $\\langle r \\rangle$ with distinct orders (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). Therefore, all 9 of these subgroups are distinct.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are 9 distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
