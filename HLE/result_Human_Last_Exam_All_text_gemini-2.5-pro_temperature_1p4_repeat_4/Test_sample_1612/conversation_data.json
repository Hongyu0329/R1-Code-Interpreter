    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Question and Define \"Triple Crown\"**\n\nThe first step is to recognize that \"Triple Crown\" can refer to two different achievements in baseball: one for batters and one for pitchers. The question \"How many triple crowns winners are there?\" is ambiguous, so it's best to analyze both types. It could also mean the number of times the feat was accomplished, or the number of unique players who did it. The most accurate answer will count the number of unique players, distinguishing between the two types of Triple Crowns.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Batting Triple Crown**\n\n**Careful Point:** The Batting Triple Crown is awarded to a player who leads their league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in a single season.\n\n*   **Criteria:**\n    1.  Highest Batting Average (BA)\n    2.  Most Home Runs (HR)\n    3.  Most Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n*   **List of Winners (Instances):**\n    There have been **17** instances of a player winning the Batting Triple Crown.\n\n*   **List of Unique Players:**\n    While there have been 17 instances, two players accomplished the feat twice.\n    *   Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n    *   Ted Williams (1942, 1947)\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    17 total instances - 2 repeat wins (one for Hornsby, one for Williams) = **15 unique Batting Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Pitching Triple Crown**\n\n**Careful Point:** The Pitching Triple Crown is awarded to a pitcher who leads their league in three key pitching categories in a single season.\n\n*   **Criteria:**\n    1.  Most Wins (W)\n    2.  Lowest Earned Run Average (ERA)\n    3.  Most Strikeouts (K)\n\n*   **List of Winners (Instances):**\n    There have been **35** instances of a pitcher winning the Triple Crown.\n\n*   **List of Unique Players:**\n    Several pitchers have won the award multiple times, including Hall of Famers like Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax, and Pete Alexander, who each won it three times.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Counting all the unique pitchers who have ever won the award gives a total of **25 unique Pitching Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nTo answer the question \"How many triple crowns winners are there?\", we should sum the number of unique players for both categories.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to confirm that no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown. No player in MLB history has accomplished this. Therefore, we can simply add the two numbers together.\n\n*   Unique Batting Winners: 15\n*   Unique Pitching Winners: 25\n*   Total Unique Triple Crown Winners = 15 + 25 = 40\n\n**Summary:**\n*   There are **15** unique players who have won the Batting Triple Crown.\n*   There are **25** unique players who have won the Pitching Triple Crown.\n*   In total, there are **40** unique players who have won a Triple Crown in MLB history.\n\n<<<40>>>"
