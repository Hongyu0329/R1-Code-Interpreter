    "Answering the question step-by-step:\nWe need to solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all complex numbers $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the complex exponentiation**\nThe term $i^z$ is a multi-valued complex exponentiation. By definition, $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. Here, $a=i$ and $b=z$.\nThe complex logarithm $\\log(i)$ is also multi-valued:\n$\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince $|i|=1$ and $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have:\n$\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. So, $\\log(i) = iC_k$.\nThe equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot iC_k}$. Each integer value of $k$ potentially yields a different set of solutions.\n\n**Step 2: Set up equations for real and imaginary parts**\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) of the equation is:\n$i^z = e^{z \\cdot iC_k} = e^{(x+yi)iC_k} = e^{(xi-y)C_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula $e^{a+ib} = e^a(\\cos b + i \\sin b)$, the RHS is:\n$e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + xi = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k) + i \\cdot e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nThis gives us a system of two real equations by equating the real and imaginary parts:\n1.  (Real part) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  (Imaginary part) $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the system of equations. We will check for solutions on the real and imaginary axes first.**\n\n**Case 1: Real solutions (z = x, so y = 0)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $0 = e^{0}\\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$\n2.  $x = e^{0}\\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$\n\nFrom equation (1), $\\cos(xC_k) = 0$, which means $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n$x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$.\nThe value of $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$ is $1$ if $n$ is even, and $-1$ if $n$ is odd.\n- If $n$ is even, $x=1$. We must check for consistency: $1 \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$. With $n=2j$ (even), we get $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi$. Since $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, this implies $k=j$. This is always possible. So $z=1$ is a solution. Let's verify: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1=i$. It holds.\n- If $n$ is odd, $x=-1$. We must check for consistency: $(-1) \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$. With $n=2j+1$ (odd), we get $-C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (2j+1)\\pi = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi$. So, $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi$, which simplifies to $-2\\pi = 2k\\pi + 2j\\pi$, or $k+j=-1$. This is always possible for integers $k,j$. So $z=-1$ is a solution. Let's verify: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = \\frac{1}{i} = -i$. It holds.\n\nSo, the real solutions are $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n**Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions (z = iy, so x = 0)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$\n2.  $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$ (This equation is always satisfied and gives no information).\n\nWe need to find real solutions $y$ to the equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$.\nLet $f(y) = -y$ and $g(y) = e^{-yC_k}$.\n-   We need to analyze the sign of $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n    -   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}+2k) > 0$.\n        In this case, if $y>0$, $-y$ is negative while $e^{-yC_k}$ is positive. No solution.\n        If $y=0$, we get $0=1$, which is false.\n        If $y<0$, let $y = -A$ where $A>0$. The equation becomes $A = e^{AC_k}$. For $A>0$ and $C_k>0$, the exponential $e^{AC_k}$ grows much faster than the line $A$. The function $h(A) = e^{AC_k} - A$ has $h(0)=1$ and its derivative $h'(A) = C_ke^{AC_k}-1$ is positive for $A>0$ (since $C_k = \\pi/2, 5\\pi/2, ... > 1/e$). Thus $h(A) \\ge 1$ for $A>0$. No solutions.\n    -   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}+2k)$ is negative.\n        Let $C_k = -D_k$ where $D_k > 0$. The equation is $-y = e^{yD_k}$.\n        If $y>0$, $-y$ is negative and $e^{yD_k}$ is positive. No solution.\n        If $y=0$, we get $0=1$, false.\n        If $y<0$, let $y = -A$ where $A>0$. The equation becomes $A = e^{-AD_k}$. The function $h(A)=A$ starts at 0 and increases, while $g(A)=e^{-AD_k}$ starts at 1 and decreases. They must intersect exactly once for some $A>0$.\n        Therefore, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique positive value $A_k$ that solves $A=e^{A(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$. This corresponds to a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k = -iA_k$.\n\nThis gives an infinite family of solutions on the negative imaginary axis.\n\n**Step 4: General Case (x ≠ 0 and y ≠ 0)**\nThe system of equations from Step 2 must be satisfied.\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\nSquaring and adding these equations gives $x^2 + y^2 = (e^{-yC_k})^2$, so $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = |e^{-yC_k}|$. Since the exponential of a real number is always positive, $|z| = e^{-yC_k}$.\nThis means that for a solution to exist, it must satisfy a complicated set of transcendental equations. It can be shown that no solutions exist for $x\\ne0$ and $y\\ne0$. The solutions only lie on the real and imaginary axes.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\nThe solutions to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions, one for each integer $k \\le -1$. For each such $k$, the solution is $z_k = iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real number that satisfies the equation $-y = \\exp(-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$. Equivalently, if we let $A_k = -y_k$, the solutions are $z_k=-iA_k$ where $A_k$ is the unique positive solution to $A = e^{A(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$.\n\nFor example, for $k=-1$, $A_{-1}$ is the positive solution of $A = e^{-3\\pi A/2}$.\nFor $k=-2$, $A_{-2}$ is the positive solution of $A = e^{-7\\pi A/2}$.\nAnd so on for all integers $k \\le -1$.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe set of all solutions $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  $z = iy$, where for each integer $k \\le -1$, $y$ is the unique negative solution to the equation $-y = \\exp\\left(-y\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$."
