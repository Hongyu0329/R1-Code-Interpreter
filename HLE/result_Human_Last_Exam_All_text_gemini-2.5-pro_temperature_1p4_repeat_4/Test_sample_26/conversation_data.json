    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the space $X$\nA smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the zero locus of a non-singular homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in four variables. From a topological perspective, $X$ is a compact, connected, orientable smooth manifold.\nThe complex dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 3. A hypersurface in it has complex dimension $3-1=2$. So, $X$ is a complex surface. As a real manifold, its dimension is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the low-dimensional homotopy groups of $X$\nWe can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, which relates the topology of a complex submanifold to that of the ambient projective space.\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (Homotopy version):** Let $M \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ be a smooth complex submanifold of dimension $m$. The inclusion map $i: M \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $i_*: \\pi_k(M) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < m$.\n\nIn our case, $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a smooth hypersurface, so its complex dimension is $m = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$. The theorem applies for $k < 2$.\nFor $k=1$, it states that $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n\nThe complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is known to be simply connected for $n \\ge 1$. This can be seen from its CW complex structure, which has no 1-cells. Therefore, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$.\nThis implies that $\\pi_1(X)=0$, so $X$ is a simply connected space.\n\n### Step 3: Relate homotopy groups to homology groups\nThe quantity we want to compute is the rank of the abelian group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group $A$ is the dimension of the rational vector space $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. So we want to find $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nFor simply connected spaces, there is a powerful result by Serre which generalizes the Hurewicz theorem to rational homotopy groups.\n*   **Serre's Rational Hurewicz Theorem:** If $Y$ is a simply connected topological space ($\\pi_1(Y)=0$), then the Hurewicz homomorphism $h_k: \\pi_k(Y) \\to H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$ induces an isomorphism on rationalizations for all $k \\ge 1$. That is, the map\n    $h_k \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}: \\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Q})$\n    is an isomorphism for all $k \\ge 1$.\n\nSince we have established that $X$ is simply connected, this theorem applies. For $k=3$, we have:\n$\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})$\n\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is therefore equal to the dimension of the third rational homology group $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})$, which is the third Betti number, $b_3(X)$.\n$\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the third Betti number $b_3(X)$\nThere are several ways to compute the Betti numbers of a smooth hypersurface in complex projective space.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using standard formulas for Betti numbers.**\n    For a smooth hypersurface $X_d$ of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ with complex dimension $m=n-1$, it is a standard result that its Betti numbers $b_k(X_d)$ are the same as those of the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, except for the middle dimension $k=m=n-1$.\n    $b_k(X_d) = b_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k \\ne n-1$.\n\n    In our case, $X$ is a quintic ($d=5$) hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ ($n=3$). The dimension of $X$ is $m=n-1=2$. The formula applies for all $k \\ne 2$. We are interested in $b_3(X)$. Since $3 \\ne 2$, we have:\n    $b_3(X) = b_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n\n    The homology groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ are well-known: $H_{2j}(\\mathbb{CP}^n; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ for $0 \\le j \\le n$, and all odd-dimensional homology groups are zero.\n    Thus, $H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, which means $b_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n    Therefore, $b_3(X) = 0$.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using Poincaré Duality.**\n    Since $X$ is a compact, connected, orientable 4-dimensional real manifold, Poincaré duality applies. It states that $H_k(X) \\cong H^{4-k}(X)$. For $k=3$, we have:\n    $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^{1}(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n    By the universal coefficient theorem, $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Q})$.\n    From the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem (or its consequence on homology), $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n    So, $\\text{Hom}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, which implies $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n    Therefore, $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})=0$, and $b_3(X) = 0$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$\nFrom Step 3, we have $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$.\nFrom Step 4, we have found that $b_3(X) = 0$.\nCombining these, we get:\n$\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 0$.\n\nThis means that the group $\\pi_3(X)$ is a torsion group, i.e., its free part is trivial."
