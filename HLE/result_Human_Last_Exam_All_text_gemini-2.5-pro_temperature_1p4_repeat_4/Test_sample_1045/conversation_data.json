    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Molecular Composition**\nThe chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**2. Understand the 6-31G Basis Set**\nThe name \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to analyze what this means for each type of atom in the molecule (Carbon and Hydrogen). The number of CGFs is equivalent to the number of basis functions.\n\n*   **For second-row atoms (like Carbon):**\n    *   **\"6-\"**: This part describes the core orbitals. The core 1s orbital is represented by a single **contracted Gaussian function (CGF)**, which is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). This gives **1 CGF** for the core.\n    *   **\"-31\"**: This part describes the valence orbitals (2s and 2p for Carbon). The valence shell is \"split\" into two sets of functions: an inner set and an outer set.\n        *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** This set consists of one s-type CGF and one set of p-type CGFs (px, py, pz). This contributes 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs**. Each of these CGFs is built from 3 PGFs.\n        *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** This set also consists of one s-type CGF and one set of p-type CGFs (px, py, pz). This contributes another 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs**. Each of these CGFs is built from 1 PGF.\n    *   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n*   **For the Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons; its 1s orbital is a valence orbital. The \"6-\" part does not apply.\n    *   **\"-31\"**: The valence 1s orbital is split into two parts.\n        *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** The inner part (1s') is represented by **1 CGF** (built from 3 PGFs).\n        *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** The outer part (1s'') is represented by **1 CGF** (built from 1 PGF).\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Number of Functions for the Molecule**\nNow, we multiply the number of CGFs per atom by the count of each atom in the toluene molecule and sum the results.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n\n*   **Total Number of Contracted Gaussian Functions:**\n    *   63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79 CGFs\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), not *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs). CGFs are the actual basis functions used in the calculation.\n*   **Split Valence:** The key is to understand that \"split-valence\" means the valence shell is represented by more than one set of basis functions (in this case, two sets: an \"inner\" and an \"outer\" one), providing more flexibility to describe chemical bonding.\n*   **Shells vs. Functions:** For p-orbitals, there are three functions (px, py, pz) for each shell representation. This must be accounted for in the count for Carbon.\n*   **Hydrogen Exception:** Remember that Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the first number in the Pople basis set name (the \"6-\") does not apply to it.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions used in a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8) is calculated as follows:\n(7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
