    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Musical Terminology\n\nFirst, let's break down the question to understand the specific musical elements we are looking for.\n\n*   **\"A song by The Beatles\"**: The search is limited to the official discography of The Beatles.\n*   **\"Starts with\"**: The chord progression must occur at the very beginning of the song, as part of the introduction or the first musical phrase.\n*   **\"Tonic chord\"**: This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's built on the first note of the scale. In Roman numeral analysis, this is represented as **I** in a major key or **i** in a minor key. For example, in the key of G Major, the tonic chord is G Major.\n*   **\"Minor fifth chord\"**: This is a more specific and less common chord.\n    *   The \"fifth\" refers to the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n    *   In a major key, the standard fifth chord (also called the dominant) is a major chord (written as **V**). For example, in the key of G Major, the fifth note is D, and the standard fifth chord is D Major.\n    *   A \"minor fifth chord\" means the chord built on the fifth note is a minor chord (written as **v**). In the key of G Major, a minor fifth chord would be D minor.\n*   **\"Chord jump\"**: This signifies a direct change from the first chord to the second.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that starts with the chord progression **I -> v**. This is an interesting progression because the **v** chord is not naturally found in a major key; it's \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key. This borrowing often creates a feeling of melancholy or sophistication.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Potential Songs\n\nLet's analyze the introductions of some famous Beatles songs to see if they fit the pattern.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: The key is G Major. It starts with a famous, complex opening chord (often debated, but functionally a dominant leading to G), not a tonic chord.\n*   **\"Yesterday\"**: The key is F Major. It starts with an F Major chord (**I**). The next chord is Em7. In the key of F, E is the seventh degree, so this is not a I -> v progression.\n*   **\"Hey Jude\"**: The key is F Major. The intro is F -> C -> C7 -> F. This is a **I -> V -> V7 -> I** progression. The fifth chord is C Major, not C minor.\n*   **\"Let It Be\"**: The key is C Major. The intro is C -> G -> Am -> F. This is a **I -> V -> vi -> IV** progression. The fifth chord is G Major, not G minor.\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: Let's analyze this one carefully. The song famously shifts between keys, but the iconic introductory guitar riff sets the tonal center.\n    *   The first chord played is **F Major**. Let's assume F Major is our tonic key (**I**).\n    *   The second chord in the descending introduction is **C minor** (often written as Cm/E to reflect the bass note). C is the fifth note of the F Major scale. The chord built on it here is a minor chord (C-Eb-G).\n    *   Therefore, the progression is **F Major -> C minor**, which is precisely **I -> v**.\n\nThis progression, I -> v, is exactly what the question asks for. The C minor chord is borrowed from the parallel key of F minor (where the verses of \"Michelle\" are played), and it creates the signature wistful sound of the song's opening.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correctly identify the key**: The concept of \"tonic\" is relative to the song's key. The intro of \"Michelle\" clearly establishes F as the tonic center before it modulates.\n2.  **Distinguish between a major V and a minor v**: This is the crucial point of the question. A I -> V progression (like in \"Hey Jude\") is extremely common. The I -> v progression is much rarer and more specific.\n3.  **Recognize borrowed chords**: The minor fifth chord (v) in a major key is a classic example of a \"borrowed chord\" or \"modal interchange,\" taken from the parallel minor key. Understanding this concept is key to identifying the progression.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the song \"Michelle\" is the one that begins with a chord jump from the tonic (F Major) to the minor fifth chord (C minor). This **I -> v** progression is the foundation of its famous and musically sophisticated introduction.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
