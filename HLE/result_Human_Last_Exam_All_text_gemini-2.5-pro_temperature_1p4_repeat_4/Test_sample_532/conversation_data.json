    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the definitions\n\n*   **Product-free set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `x, y` in `S` (including `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S ∩ S² = ∅`, where `S² = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`. A direct consequence is that the identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set, because if `e ∈ S`, then for any `s ∈ S`, `es = s`, which must not be in `S`, a contradiction.\n\n*   **Maximal product-free set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal (by inclusion) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n\n*   **Filled group:** A finite group `G` is called filled if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G \\ {e}`. In other words, every non-identity element of `G` belongs to at least one maximal product-free set.\n\n*   **Nilpotent group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: Reduce the problem from nilpotent groups to p-groups\n\nLet `G` be a finite nilpotent group. By definition, `G` can be written as a direct product of its Sylow subgroups:\n`G = P₁ × P₂ × ... × P_k`, where `P_i` is the Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G` for distinct primes `p_i`.\n\nIt is a known result in this area of group theory that a direct product `G = A × B` with `gcd(|A|, |B|) = 1` is a filled group if and only if both `A` and `B` are filled groups. This property extends to the direct product of all Sylow subgroups.\n\nTherefore, the problem of classifying finite filled nilpotent groups reduces to the problem of classifying finite filled `p`-groups for all primes `p`. Once we have this classification, a nilpotent group `G` will be filled if and only if each of its Sylow subgroups fits the classification of a filled `p`-group.\n\n### Step 3: Classify finite filled p-groups\n\nThe classification of finite filled `p`-groups is a non-trivial result from the literature, primarily established by Ya. G. Berkovich and G. G. Pitanov. Their results provide a complete classification.\n\n**Case 1: `p` is an odd prime**\nFor an odd prime `p`, a finite `p`-group `P` is filled if and only if `P` is **abelian**. Non-abelian `p`-groups of odd order are not filled.\n\n**Case 2: `p = 2`**\nA finite 2-group `P` is filled if and only if it is one of the following types:\na.  A **cyclic group** `C_{2^k}` for some `k ≥ 1`.\nb.  A direct product of **two cyclic groups**, `C_{2^a} × C_{2^b}` for some `a, b ≥ 1`. This includes elementary abelian groups of rank 2 like `C₂ × C₂`.\nc.  A **generalized quaternion group** `Q_{2^n}` for some `n ≥ 3`. These are non-abelian groups defined by the presentation `<x, y | x^(2^(n-1)) = e, y² = x^(2^(n-2)), y⁻¹xy = x⁻¹>`.\n\nCrucially, this classification implies that non-abelian 2-groups that are not generalized quaternion (like the dihedral group `D₄`) are not filled. It also implies that abelian 2-groups which are the direct product of three or more cyclic groups (e.g., `C₂ × C₂ × C₂`) are not filled.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the final answer for nilpotent groups\n\nNow we combine the results from Steps 2 and 3 to describe all finite filled nilpotent groups.\nLet `G` be a finite nilpotent group. Let its Sylow decomposition be `G = P_{p_1} × P_{p_2} × ... × P_{p_k}`.\n`G` is filled if and only if each `P_{p_i}` is filled.\n\nThis leads to the following conditions on the structure of `G`:\n\n1.  **Sylow subgroups for odd primes:** For every odd prime `p` dividing `|G|`, the Sylow `p`-subgroup of `G` must be filled. According to the classification, this means it must be **abelian**. The direct product of the Sylow subgroups for all odd primes must therefore be an abelian group of odd order.\n\n2.  **Sylow 2-subgroup:** If `|G|` is even, the Sylow 2-subgroup of `G` must be a filled 2-group. According to the classification, it must be one of the types listed in Step 3, Case 2.\n\nWe can summarize the final characterization as follows:\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if it is a direct product `G = A × P`, where:\n*   `A` is a finite abelian group of odd order.\n*   `P` is a 2-group that is one of the following types:\n    *   The trivial group `{e}` (if `G` has odd order).\n    *   A cyclic group `C_{2^k}` for `k ≥ 1`.\n    *   A direct product of two cyclic groups `C_{2^a} × C_{2^b}` for `a, b ≥ 1`.\n    *   A generalized quaternion group `Q_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 3`.\n\nThis provides the complete classification of finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n<<<A finite group G is a filled nilpotent group if and only if it is a direct product G = A × P, where A is a finite abelian group of odd order, and P is a 2-group that is one of the following:\n1. The trivial group {e}.\n2. A cyclic group C_{2^k} for some integer k ≥ 1.\n3. The direct product of two cyclic groups, C_{2^a} × C_{2^b}, for some integers a, b ≥ 1.\n4.
