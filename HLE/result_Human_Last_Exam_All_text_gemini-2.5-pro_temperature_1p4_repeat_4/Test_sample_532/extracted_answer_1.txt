A finite group G is a filled nilpotent group if and only if it is a direct product G = A × P, where A is a finite abelian group of odd order, and P is a 2-group that is one of the following:
1. The trivial group {e}.
2. A cyclic group C_{2^k} for some integer k ≥ 1.
3. The direct product of two cyclic groups, C_{2^a} × C_{2^b}, for some integers a, b ≥ 1.
4. A generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n} for some integer n ≥ 3.
