    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Representation:** In combinatorial game theory, numbers can be represented by game positions. Specifically, dyadic rational numbers (numbers of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$) can be represented by a simple game structure in red-blue-Hackenbush called a \"Hackenbush stalk\" or \"Hackenbush string.\" This is a single path of colored edges connected to a baseline called the \"ground.\"\n\n2.  **The Algorithm for Construction:** The specific sequence of red and blue edges needed to represent a positive number is determined by its binary (base-2) representation. The algorithm is as follows:\n    *   First, separate the number into its integer part and its fractional part.\n    *   The integer part, let's call it *I*, is represented by *I* blue edges stacked one on top of the other, starting from the ground.\n    *   The fractional part is converted into its binary representation (e.g., $0.5 = 0.1_2$).\n    *   Then, for each digit after the binary point, an edge is added to the top of the stalk. A '1' in the binary expansion corresponds to a **blue** edge, and a '0' corresponds to a **red** edge. The edges are added in order of the binary digits, from most significant (closest to the binary point) to least significant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Algorithm to $\\frac{13}{16}$:**\n    *   **Integer Part:** The number is $\\frac{13}{16}$, which is $0.8125$. The integer part is **0**. This means we do not add any initial blue edges for the integer part.\n    *   **Fractional Part:** The fractional part is the entire number, $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n4.  **Convert the Fractional Part to Binary:** We need to find the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n    *   We can do this by expressing the numerator in terms of powers of 2: $13 = 8 + 4 + 1$.\n    *   So, $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+0+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{0}{16} + \\frac{1}{16}$.\n    *   Simplifying these fractions gives powers of $\\frac{1}{2}$: $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16}$.\n    *   In binary positional notation, this is written as $0.1101_2$. The first digit after the point is the coefficient of $\\frac{1}{2}$, the second is the coefficient of $\\frac{1}{4}$, the third for $\\frac{1}{8}$, and the fourth for $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n5.  **Map Binary Digits to Pieces:**\n    *   The binary representation is $0.1101_2$.\n    *   The structure is built from the fractional part's digits. Each digit corresponds to one piece. Since there are four digits (1, 1, 0, 1), there will be a total of **4** pieces.\n    *   Let's determine the color of each piece:\n        *   The first digit is **1** -> a **blue** piece is placed on the ground.\n        *   The second digit is **1** -> a **blue** piece is placed on top of the first piece.\n        *   The third digit is **0** -> a **red** piece is placed on top of the second piece.\n        *   The fourth digit is **1** -> a **blue** piece is placed on top of the third piece.\n\n6.  **Count the Total Number of Pieces:** The resulting Hackenbush stalk consists of a sequence of 4 edges.\n    *   Number of blue pieces (corresponding to '1's): 3\n    *   Number of red pieces (corresponding to '0's): 1\n    *   The total number of pieces needed is the sum of the red and blue pieces: $3 + 1 = 4$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The representation for positive numbers is standard. For negative numbers, one would construct the game for the positive value and then swap all the colors (red to blue and blue to red).\n*   The integer part of the number corresponds to a base of solid blue pieces (if positive) or red pieces (if negative). Since our number is between 0 and 1, this part of the construction is not needed.\n*   The number of pieces is determined by the number of digits in the (finite) binary expansion of the fractional part. For a fraction $\\frac{m}{2^n}$, the binary expansion will have at most *n* digits after the point. For $\\frac{13}{16}$, $n=4$, and the binary expansion $0.1101_2$ has exactly 4 digits.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTo represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$, we need to construct a Hackenbush stalk based on its binary representation, $0.1101_2$. This requires one piece for each of the four binary digits. Therefore, a total of 4 pieces are needed.\n\n<<<4>>>"
