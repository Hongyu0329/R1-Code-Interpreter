    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for three key things:\n1.  The film must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It must be the *first* winner to do so, which requires a chronological search.\n3.  It must depict \"a Luxor Obelisk.\" This is a crucial detail.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\"**\nThere are two famous Luxor Obelisks, originally created for the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   Its twin was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nTherefore, a film depicting either the original site in Luxor or the Place de la Concorde in Paris would satisfy the condition.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a Strategy**\nThe most effective strategy is to review the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, starting from the first award in 1927/28. We will specifically look for films set in Paris, France, or Luxor, Egypt. Paris is a more likely setting for early Oscar-winning films.\n\n**Step 4: Execute the Chronological Search**\n\n*   **1927/28: *Wings*** - This film is set during World War I and has scenes in Paris. However, analysis of the Parisian scenes shows they are focused on characters in cafes and theaters (like the Folies Bergère), not on wide shots of city monuments like the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **1928/29 - 1936:** The winners during this period include *The Broadway Melody* (New York), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (German frontlines), *Cimarron* (American West), *Grand Hotel* (Berlin), *Cavalcade* (Britain), *It Happened One Night* (U.S. road trip), *Mutiny on the Bounty* (sea/Tahiti), and *The Great Ziegfeld* (New York). None of these are set in Paris or Luxor.\n*   **1937: *The Life of Emile Zola*** - This biographical film is set almost entirely in Paris. It tells the story of the French writer Émile Zola and his involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, a pivotal event in French history. To establish the setting, the film uses various shots of Paris. It is confirmed that the film includes establishing shots of the Place de la Concorde, which prominently features the Luxor Obelisk. As a Best Picture winner, this becomes our earliest strong candidate.\n*   **1938 - 1950:** Winners from this period like *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *Casablanca*, and *All About Eve* are set in the American South, England, Morocco, and New York, respectively. None feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n*   **1951: *An American in Paris*** - This film is famous for its Paris setting. The climactic ballet sequence features a large, stylized set representing the Place de la Concorde, with the obelisk as a centerpiece. While this is a very famous depiction, it comes 14 years after *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n*   **Later Winners:** Several other winners, such as *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) and *Gigi* (1958), also show the Parisian obelisk. Films set in Egypt, like *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962), have scenes in Cairo but not at the Luxor Temple. No earlier Best Picture winner features a clear depiction of the obelisk in Luxor, Egypt.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nWhile films like *An American in Paris* have more memorable scenes featuring the obelisk, the question is about the *first* instance. Chronologically, *The Life of Emile Zola* (winner for 1937) precedes all other Best Picture winners that depict the Luxor Obelisk in Paris's Place de la Concorde.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
