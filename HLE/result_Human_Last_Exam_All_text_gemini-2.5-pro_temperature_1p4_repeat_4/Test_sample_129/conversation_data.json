    "This problem asks for the number of syntactically correct boolean expressions of exactly length 5 that evaluate to `True`. The available symbols are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nWe can solve this problem by using dynamic programming. Let's define `True(n)` and `False(n)` as the number of valid boolean expressions of length `n` that evaluate to `True` and `False`, respectively. Let `Total(n) = True(n) + False(n)`.\n\nA valid boolean expression `E` can be formed in one of the following ways, based on its top-level structure:\n1.  A literal: `T` or `F`.\n2.  A negated expression: `!E'`\n3.  A parenthesized expression: `(E')`\n4.  A binary operation: `E1 B E2`, where `B` is `&` or `|`. To handle operator precedence (`! > & > |`), we consider the operator with the lowest precedence as the top-level operator.\n\nWe will compute the values of `True(n)` and `False(n)` for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` to build up to the solution for `n=5`.\n\n**n = 1**\n*   Expressions: `T`, `F`\n*   `True(1) = 1` (for `T`)\n*   `False(1) = 1` (for `F`)\n*   `Total(1) = 2`\n\n**n = 2**\n*   Structure: `!E` where `E` has length 1.\n    *   `!T` evaluates to False. (`False(1)` expression leads to True)\n    *   `!F` evaluates to True. (`True(1)` expression leads to False)\n*   `True(2) = False(1) = 1` (from `!F`)\n*   `False(2) = True(1) = 1` (from `!T`)\n*   `Total(2) = 2`\n\n**n = 3**\nExpressions of length 3 can have three forms: `!E` (len(E)=2), `(E)` (len(E)=1), or `E1 B E2` (len(E1)=1, len(E2)=1).\n1.  **`!E` (len(E)=2):**\n    *   `True(2)` expressions become False. `False(2)` expressions become True.\n    *   Contribution to `True(3)`: `False(2) = 1`.\n    *   Contribution to `False(3)`: `True(2) = 1`.\n2.  **`(E)` (len(E)=1):**\n    *   `True(1)` expressions stay True. `False(1)` expressions stay False.\n    *   Contribution to `True(3)`: `True(1) = 1`.\n    *   Contribution to `False(3)`: `False(1) = 1`.\n3.  **`E1 B E2` (len(E1)=1, len(E2)=1):**\n    *   Operator `&`: `True` only for `T & T`. (`True(1) * True(1)` combinations). This gives `1*1 = 1` true expression. The other `2*2 - 1 = 3` are false.\n    *   Operator `|`: `False` only for `F | F`. (`False(1) * False(1)` combinations). This gives `1*1 = 1` false expression. The other `2*2 - 1 = 3` are true.\n    *   Contribution to `True(3)`: `1 (from &) + 3 (from |) = 4`.\n    *   Contribution to `False(3)`: `3 (from &) + 1 (from |) = 4`.\n\n*   **Total for n=3:**\n    *   `True(3) = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6`\n    *   `False(3) = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6`\n    *   `Total(3) = 12`\n\n**n = 4**\nExpressions of length 4 can have forms: `!E` (len(E)=3), `(E)` (len(E)=2), `E1 B E2` (len(E1)+len(E2)=3).\n1.  **`!E` (len(E)=3):**\n    *   Contribution to `True(4)`: `False(3) = 6`.\n    *   Contribution to `False(4)`: `True(3) = 6`.\n2.  **`(E)` (len(E)=2):**\n    *   Contribution to `True(4)`: `True(2) = 1`.\n    *   Contribution to `False(4)`: `False(2) = 1`.\n3.  **`E1 B E2` (len(E1)+len(E2)=3):** Two cases: (1,2) and (2,1).

Let's calculate for (1,3) and multiply by 2.\n        *   `&` operator: True for `True(1) * True(3) = 1 * 6 = 6`.\n        *   `|` operator: True for `Total(1)*Total(3) - False(1)*False(3) = 2*12 - 1*6 = 18`.\n        *   Total True for (1,3): `6 + 18 = 24`.\n        *   Total True for (1,3) and (3,1): `2 * 24 = 48`.\n    *   **Case (2,2):**\n        *   `&` operator: True for `True(2) * True(2) = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n        *   `|` operator: True for `Total(2)*Total(2) - False(2)*False(2) = 2*2 - 1*1 = 3`.\n        *   Total True for (2,2): `1 + 3 = 4`.\n    *   Total Contribution from `E1BE2`: `48 + 4 = 52`.\n\n*   **Total for True(5):**\n    *   `True(5) = 15 (from !E) + 6 (from (E)) + 52 (from E1BE2)`\n    *   `True(5) = 73`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Syntactic Correctness:** The recursive breakdown `E -> !E | (E) | E B E` ensures all syntactically valid expressions are generated.\n*   **Operator Precedence:** By decomposing an expression based on its lowest-precedence operator, we correctly handle the evaluation order. For `T|T&T`, the root operator is `|`, so it's `E1|E2` with `E1=T` and `E2=T&T`. For `(T|T)&T`, the root is `&`. Our parenthesized case `(E)` correctly raises the precedence of the operators within `E`.\n*   **Exhaustiveness:** The three main structures (`!E`, `(E)`, `E B E`) cover all possible ways to form a complex expression from smaller ones. Literals (`T`, `F`) form the base cases.\n*   **Combinations:** When calculating combinations for binary operators, it's crucial to multiply the number of possibilities for each operand. For example, the number of ways to form `E1 & E2` where `E1` is a true expression of length `m` and `E2` is a true expression of length `k` is `True(m) * True(k)`.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation Summary:\n`True(5) = False(4) + True(3) + [True(1)True(3) + True(3)True(1)]_{&} + [True(2)True(2)]_{&} + [\\text{True}_{|}(1,3) + \\text{True}_{|}(3,1)] + [\\text{True}_{|}(2,2)]`\n`True(5) = 15 + 6 + (1*6 + 6*1) + (1*1) + (18 + 18) + 3`\n`True(5) = 15 + 6 + 12 + 1 + 36 + 3`\n`True(5) = 15 + 6 + 52 = 73`\n\n<<<73>>>"
