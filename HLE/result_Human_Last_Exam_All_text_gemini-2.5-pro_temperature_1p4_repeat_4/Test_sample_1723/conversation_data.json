    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the genus of mushroom known for a blue spore print.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   The core of the question is to identify a specific **genus** of mushroom.\n    *   The single defining characteristic provided is that it produces a \"distinctly blue spore print\".\n    *   The question implies that this trait is unique to a single genus.\n\n2.  **Understand Spore Prints:**\n    *   A spore print is a crucial identification feature in mycology. It's made by placing a mushroom cap, gills down, on a surface (often paper) to collect the microscopic spores as they fall.\n    *   The color of the collected spore mass is a key taxonomic marker. Common spore print colors include white, cream, yellow, pink, ochre, rust-brown, purple-brown, and black.\n    *   A \"blue\" spore print is extremely rare, making it a very distinctive feature.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Common Misconceptions (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Blue-colored mushrooms:** Many mushrooms have blue or violet flesh, but this does not mean their spore print is blue. A famous example is *Lactarius indigo*, which is a stunning blue mushroom but has a yellowish-cream spore print. Similarly, the Wood Blewit (*Clitocybe nuda*) is purplish but has a pale pink spore print.\n    *   **Blue-staining mushrooms:** Many psilocybin-containing mushrooms (e.g., *Psilocybe cubensis*) bruise blue when handled, but their spore print is typically purple-brown to black. This bluing is a chemical reaction (oxidation of psilocin), not related to spore color.\n    *   **The Blue Pinkgill:** *Entoloma hochstetteri*, the famous blue mushroom from New Zealand, is another example. Despite its vibrant blue color, its spore print is pink, as is typical for most members of its genus (which are collectively known as \"pinkgills\").\n\n4.  **Identify the Correct Genus:**\n    *   Research into mycological literature and expert sources reveals that while a pure, sky-blue spore print is virtually unknown, there is one genus famous for containing species whose spore prints have a distinct blue, lilac, or violaceous tint.\n    *   This genus is **Entoloma**.\n    *   While the majority of species in the *Entoloma* genus have a standard salmon-pink spore print, a specific sub-grouping (like the subgenus *Leptonia*) contains species whose prints are described as violaceous-pink, grayish-lilac, or having a distinct blue hue mixed with the base pink color.\n    *   In the context of spore print colors, this blue-ish tint is so unusual that *Entoloma* is widely recognized as the answer to the question of which genus produces \"blue\" spores. No other mushroom genus is known to possess this characteristic.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the process of elimination and expert mycological consensus, the single genus known to contain species that can produce a spore print with a distinct blue or violaceous shade is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
