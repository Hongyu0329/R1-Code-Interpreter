    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand Trisyllabic Laxing (or Shortening)**\n\n*   **Definition:** Trisyllabic laxing is a historical sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word.\n*   **Condition:** The word must have at least three syllables for this rule to apply.\n*   **Examples of Vowel Alternations:**\n    *   /eɪ/ → /æ/ (as in *sane* → *sanity*)\n    *   /iː/ → /ɛ/ (as in *serene* → *serenity*)\n    *   /aɪ/ → /ɪ/ (as in *divine* → *divinity*)\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word**\n\nWe will examine each word to see if it fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing. This involves checking the syllable count and looking for a related word with a tense vowel.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Syllables:** Two syllables (south-ern).\n    *   **Analysis:** Since the word has only two syllables, it cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing by definition. The vowel change between *south* (/aʊ/) and *southern* (/ʌ/) is due to a much older shortening rule that occurred in Old English before certain consonant clusters, not the Middle English rule of trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has NOT undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Syllables:** Four syllables (de-riv-a-tive).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is related to *derive* (/dɪˈraɪv/), which has a tense vowel /aɪ/. In *derivative* (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), the corresponding vowel is the lax /ɪ/. The vowel is in a syllable ('-riv-') followed by two subsequent syllables ('-a-tive'), which is the environment that triggers the rule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** HAS undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Syllables:** Four syllables (se-ren-i-ty).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a classic textbook example. It is related to *serene* (/səˈriːn/), which has a tense vowel /iː/. In *serenity* (/səˈrɛnəti/), the vowel laxes to /ɛ/. The vowel is in a syllable ('-ren-') followed by two more syllables ('-i-ty').\n    *   **Conclusion:** HAS undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Syllables:** Two syllables (pleas-ant).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word only has two syllables, so it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. The vowel alternation between *please* (/pliːz/) and *pleasant* (/ˈplɛzənt/) is due to other historical factors (the vowel in *please* was lengthened in Middle English, while the vowel in *pleasant* was not).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has NOT undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Syllables:** Three syllables (grat-i-tude).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is related to *grateful* (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/), which shows the tense vowel /eɪ/. In *gratitude* (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/), the vowel /eɪ/ has laxed to /æ/. The vowel is in the first syllable, which is the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable. This perfectly fits the rule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** HAS undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Syllables:** Two syllables (shad-ow).\n    *   **Analysis:** Like *pleasant*, this word is disyllabic and therefore cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. The vowel alternation between *shade* (/ʃeɪd/) and *shadow* (/ˈʃædoʊ/) is explained by historical processes other than trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has NOT undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**3. Identify the Correct Answer**\n\nWe have identified three words that did not undergo trisyllabic laxing: *southern*, *pleasant*, and *shadow*. The primary reason for all three is that they are not trisyllabic. However, we must choose the best single answer.\n\nLet's compare them:\n*   *derivative*, *serenity*, and *gratitude* all clearly underwent the specific process of trisyllabic laxing during the Middle English period.\n*   *pleasant* and *shadow* show vowel alternations related to other Middle English sound laws, but not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   *southern* also shows a vowel alternation, but it results from a shortening process that is much older (Old English) and prompted by a different phonological reason (a following consonant cluster) than the Middle English syllable-counting rules.\n\nOf the three candidates that did not undergo trisyllabic laxing, *southern* is the most distinct. The historical process affecting its vowel length is entirely different in nature, timing, and cause from trisyllabic laxing and its related Middle English rules. This makes it the strongest answer.\n\n<<<southern>>>"
