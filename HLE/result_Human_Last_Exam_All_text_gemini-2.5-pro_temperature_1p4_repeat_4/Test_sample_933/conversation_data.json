    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Synthesis Reaction:** The most common and direct method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is the reaction of elemental Xenon (Xe) with elemental Fluorine (F2). The chemical equation is:\n    Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n2.  **Understand the Synthesis Conditions:** The synthesis of xenon fluorides is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions, specifically the molar ratio of reactants, pressure, and temperature. By controlling these variables, one can selectively produce XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Role of Temperature:** This reaction requires a significant amount of energy, known as activation energy, to get started. This energy is typically supplied in the form of heat.\n    *   **If the temperature is too low:** The reactant molecules will not have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. As a result, the reaction rate will be extremely slow or negligible, making the synthesis process inefficient. Temperatures like 200 °C, 78 °C, 0 °C, and -78 °C are generally too low for an efficient thermal reaction between xenon and fluorine.\n    *   **If the temperature is too high:** While the reaction rate will be high, it can lead to the formation of a different product. The formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) is favored at higher temperatures (e.g., above 500°C) and higher fluorine concentrations. So, a temperature like 600 °C would not be efficient for producing XeF4, as it would predominantly yield XeF6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Optimal Temperature for XeF4:** Extensive experimental studies have established the optimal conditions for synthesizing each of the xenon fluorides. For the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), the established method involves:\n    *   Using a molar ratio of Xe to F2 of about 1:5.\n    *   Heating the mixture in a sealed nickel vessel under pressure (around 6 atmospheres).\n    *   Maintaining a temperature of approximately **400 °C**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. 600 C: This temperature is too high and favors the formation of XeF6. It is not efficient for XeF4 production.\n    *   B. 400 C: This is the standard, well-documented temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF4. It provides a good balance between a fast reaction rate and selectivity for the desired product.\n    *   C. 200 C: This temperature is too low for the thermal reaction to proceed at an efficient rate.\n    *   D. 78 C: This temperature is far too low for a thermal reaction.\n    *   E. 0 C: This temperature is far too low for a thermal reaction.\n    *   F. -78 C: This temperature is far too low for a thermal reaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the established chemical synthesis methods, 400 °C is the standard and lowest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently in good yield via the direct reaction of the elements.\n\n<<<B>>>"
