Yes, this theory can fail if a birefringent medium is added to the system. The theory relies on an inversion procedure that only corrects for the spatial effects of the random medium (described by T). The birefringent medium introduces a polarization-dependent transformation (described by a Jones matrix J). The inversion procedure does not account for this polarization change. Consequently, when the calculated input beam is propagated through the system containing the birefringent element, its polarization is transformed twice (resulting in a JÂ² operation), which does not reproduce the single polarization transformation (J) of the target output beam. This mismatch in the final polarization state means the theory no longer holds.
