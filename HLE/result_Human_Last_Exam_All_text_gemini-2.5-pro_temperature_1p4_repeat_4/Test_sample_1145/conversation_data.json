    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding a particle within a specific small interval in a one-dimensional box.\n*   **System:** A particle in a 1D infinite potential well (a \"box\").\n*   **Length of the box:** `a`. The box extends from `x=0` to `x=a`.\n*   **Quantum State:** The particle is in the second energy level, so the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Interval of Interest:** From `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Relevant Quantum Mechanics Formulae**\nThe probability `P` of finding a particle in a region from `x₁` to `x₂` is given by the integral of the probability density, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that region.\n`P = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] |ψₙ(x)|² dx`\n\nThe normalized wavefunction `ψₙ(x)` for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is:\n`ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n\n**Step 3: Define the Wavefunction and Probability Density for n=2**\nFor the `n = 2` state, the wavefunction is:\n`ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n\nThe probability density `|ψ₂(x)|²` is therefore:\n`|ψ₂(x)|² = [√(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)]² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\n**Step 4: Set Up the Integral for the Specific Interval**\nWe need to integrate the probability density from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`:\n`P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**Careful Point 1: The location of the interval.**\nThe interval is centered at `(0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`. For the `n=2` state, the wavefunction `ψ₂(x)` has a node (a point where the wavefunction is zero) at `x = a/2` because `sin(2π(a/2) / a) = sin(π) = 0`. Therefore, the probability density is zero exactly at the center of our interval. Because the interval is very narrow and centered on a minimum, we expect the probability to be very small, but not exactly zero. A simple approximation like `P ≈ |ψ(x_center)|² * Δx` would incorrectly give `P=0`. We must perform the full integration.\n\n**Step 5: Solve the Integral**\nWe use the trigonometric identity `sin²(θ) = ½(1 - cos(2θ))`. In our integral, `θ = 2πx / a`.\n`P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * ½(1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx`\n`P = (1/a) * ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx`\n\nNow, we perform the integration:\n`P = (1/a) * [x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)]` evaluated from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n\n`P = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a / 4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a / 4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }`\n\nGroup the terms:\n`P = (1/a) * { (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a / 4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }`\n\nSimplify:\n`P = (1/a) * { 0.01a - (a / 4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }`\n`P = 0.01 - (1 / 4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]`\n\nUsing trigonometric identities `sin(2π + α) = sin(α)` and `sin(2π - α) = -sin(α)`:\n`sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)`\n`sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)`\n\nSubstitute these back into the equation for P:\n`P = 0.01 - (1 / 4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]`\n`P = 0.01 - (1 / 4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]`\n`P = 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π)`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n\n**Careful Point 2: Numerical precision.**\nThe calculation now involves subtracting two numbers that are very close to each other (`0.01` and `sin(0.02π) / (2π)`). This can lead to a large loss of precision. The most reliable way to evaluate this is to use a Taylor series expansion for the sine term.\nThe Taylor series for `sin(y)` around `y=0` is `sin(y) ≈ y - y³/3! + ...`.\nLet `y = 0.02π`.\n`P ≈ 0.01 - (y - y³/6) / (2π)`\n`P ≈ (0.02π / (2π)) - (y - y³/6) / (2π) `  *(Note: 0.01 = 0.02π / 2π)*\n`P ≈ (y - (y - y³/6)) / (2π)`\n`P ≈ (y³/6) / (2π) = y³ / (12π)`\n\nNow substitute `y = 0.02π`:\n`P ≈ (0.02π)³ / (12π) = (0.000008 * π³) / (12π) = (0.000008 * π²) / 12`\n\nUsing `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n`P ≈ (0.000008 * 9.8696) / 12`\n`P ≈ 0.000078957 / 12`\n`P ≈ 0.00000657975`\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the probability is `6.58 × 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
