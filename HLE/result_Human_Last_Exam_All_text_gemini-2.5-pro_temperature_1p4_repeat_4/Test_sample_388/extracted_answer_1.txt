The most critical counseling recommendation the pharmacist could make is to advise Allison about the drug interaction between her Fluoxetine and the aspirin in the Excedrin she took. The combination of an SSRI (Fluoxetine) and an NSAID (aspirin) significantly increases the risk of bleeding, particularly from the stomach. The pharmacist should recommend that for future headaches, she use a safer alternative like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and to consult her doctor if her headaches continue or worsen.
