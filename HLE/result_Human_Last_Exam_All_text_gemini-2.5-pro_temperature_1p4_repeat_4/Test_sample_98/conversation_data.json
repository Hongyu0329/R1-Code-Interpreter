    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Properties of an Icosahedron**\nAn icosahedron is a Platonic solid, which means it is a convex polyhedron with congruent regular polygonal faces.\n*   It has 20 faces, and each face is an equilateral triangle.\n*   It has 30 edges and 12 vertices.\n*   A key property for this problem is that the icosahedron is centrally symmetric. This means it has a center point, and for any point P within the solid, there is a corresponding point P' on the opposite side, such that the center point is the midpoint of the line segment PP'. This symmetry applies to its vertices, edges, and faces. For every face, there is an identical, parallel face on the opposite side.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Setup of the Tank**\n*   **Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the equilateral triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base. Due to the central symmetry of the icosahedron, the face opposite the base is also a horizontal equilateral triangle, forming the top of the tank.\n*   **Water Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Position of the Water Surface**\n*   The surface of a liquid under gravity is always a horizontal plane.\n*   For any object that has a center of symmetry, a plane that divides the object into two equal volumes must pass through that center of symmetry.\n*   Since the icosahedron tank is centrally symmetric and half-filled, the horizontal water surface must be the specific horizontal plane that passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Symmetry of the Water Surface**\nThe shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by intersecting the icosahedron with this central horizontal plane. We can determine the shape of this cross-section by analyzing its symmetries.\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** When an icosahedron stands on a triangular face, the vertical axis passing through the center of the base face and the center of the solid is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. This means that rotating the icosahedron by 120° or 240° around this axis leaves the icosahedron unchanged. Since the water surface is a horizontal plane perpendicular to this axis, the cross-sectional shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Point Symmetry (Central Symmetry):** As established in Step 3, the plane of the water surface passes through the center of symmetry of the icosahedron. This means that the resulting 2D shape (the cross-section) must also be centrally symmetric. If a point is on the edge of the shape, the point directly opposite it through the center must also be on the edge.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Shape**\nWe are looking for a polygon that satisfies two symmetry conditions:\n1.  It has 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n2.  It has a center of symmetry (which is equivalent to 2-fold rotational symmetry).\n\nA planar polygon that has both 3-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry must have 6-fold rotational symmetry. The only polygon with 6-fold rotational symmetry is a **regular hexagon**.\n\nThe vertices of this hexagon are the points where the horizontal central plane intersects the edges of the icosahedron. The combined symmetries guarantee these intersection points are arranged as the vertices of a regular hexagon.\n\n---\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n1.  **Recognize Central Symmetry:** The most crucial property of the icosahedron for this problem is its central symmetry.\n2.  **Half-Filled Implication:** Connect the \"half-filled\" condition to the water level passing through the center of symmetry.\n3.  **Orientation and Rotational Symmetry:** Understand that standing the icosahedron on a face establishes a vertical 3-fold symmetry axis.\n4.  **Combining Symmetries:** The shape of the cross-section must inherit the symmetries of the solid relative to the intersecting plane.\n5.  **Geometric Theorem:** Apply the principle that a shape with both 3-fold and central (2-fold) symmetry must be a regular hexagon.\n\n---\nFinal Answer: The shape of the water surface will be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
