    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main character and the novel.**\nThe novel is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (\"Perfect Imperfection\") by Polish science fiction author Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, a man from our near-present (21st century) who is resurrected in the very distant future.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationships of the main character.**\nUpon his resurrection, Adam Zamoyski is guided and protected by a powerful, post-human entity. This character becomes his primary companion, lover, and partner throughout the story. Their relationship is central to the plot.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the main character's partner.**\nThe name of this central female character, with whom Adam Zamoyski forms the most significant and lasting bond, is Angelika.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the meaning of \"marries\" in the context of the novel.**\nThis is a careful point. The society depicted in \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a far-future, post-human civilization. Traditional human concepts like marriage do not exist in the same way. There is no formal wedding ceremony or legal contract as we would understand it. However, the bond between Adam and Angelika is a complete, symbiotic union that is the narrative and functional equivalent of a marriage. They are inextricably linked, and their relationship evolves into a deep, permanent partnership. Therefore, in the context of the story's themes and plot, Angelika is the character that he \"marries.\"\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a life-long, profound union that is the equivalent of a marriage with the character named Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
