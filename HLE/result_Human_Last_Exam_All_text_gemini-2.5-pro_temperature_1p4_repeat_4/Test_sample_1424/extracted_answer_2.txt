The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency-energy term $\hbar\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. Specifically, its form is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta}$, where the eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$ define the poles of the function.
