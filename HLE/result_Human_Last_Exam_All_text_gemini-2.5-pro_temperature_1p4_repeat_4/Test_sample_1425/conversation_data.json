    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Framework**: The problem asks for the partition function `Z` in the **grand canonical ensemble (GCE)** using the **path integral** method.\n2.  **System Hamiltonian**: The system's Hamiltonian is given as `H^ = -μN^`, where `μ` is the chemical potential and `N^` is the particle number operator.\n3.  **Grand Canonical Partition Function**: The standard definition of the GCE partition function is `Z = Tr[e^(-β(H_sys - μN^))]`, where `H_sys` is the system's Hamiltonian and `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature.\n4.  **Interpretation**: The most rigorous interpretation of the problem statement \"a system with Hamiltonian H^ = -μN^\" is that this is the system Hamiltonian, i.e., `H_sys = -μN^`.\n5.  **Operator in the Exponent**: Substituting this into the GCE formula gives the operator for which we need to calculate the trace:\n    `H_sys - μN^ = (-μN^) - μN^ = -2μN^`.\n    Therefore, the partition function to be calculated is `Z = Tr[e^(-β(-2μN^))] = Tr[e^(2βμN^)]`.\n6.  **Equivalent System**: This is the partition function for a system with a zero kinetic/potential Hamiltonian (`H_sys = 0`) but with an effective chemical potential of `2μ`. Our task is to calculate this using path integrals.\n7.  **Particle Statistics**: The result will depend on whether the particles are bosons or fermions. Since it is not specified, we will derive the result for both cases.\n8.  **Degeneracy**: The Hamiltonian `H_sys = 0` implies that all single-particle states have zero energy. We assume there are `M` such degenerate single-particle states. `M` could represent the number of lattice sites, the number of discrete momentum modes in a volume, etc. The final answer will depend on `M`.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation using Path Integrals\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Euclidean Action**\n\nThe path integral representation for the partition function is `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S)`, where `S` is the Euclidean action. The action is derived from the operator in the exponent, `K^ = H_sys - (2μ)N^ = 0 - (2μ)N^ = -2μ ∫ d^d x ψ^†(x)ψ^(x)`.\n\nThe corresponding Lagrangian density `L` for a quantum field `ψ` is given by:\n`L = ψ*(∂_τ + H_sp - 2μ)ψ`\nSince the single-particle Hamiltonian `H_sp` is zero, the Lagrangian density becomes:\n`L = ψ*(∂_τ + 2μ)ψ`\n\nThe action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over imaginary time `τ` from 0 to `β` and over all space:\n`S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x  ψ*(x,τ)(∂_τ + 2μ)ψ(x,τ)`\n\n**Step 2: Transform to Fourier Space**\n\nTo evaluate the path integral, we transform the fields into Fourier modes (in momentum `k` and Matsubara frequency `ω_n`):\n`ψ(x,τ) = (1/√(Vβ)) Σ_(k,n) e^(i(k·x - ω_nτ)) ψ_(k,ω_n)`\n\nSubstituting this into the action diagonalizes it, yielding a sum over independent modes:\n`S = Σ_(k,n) ψ*_(k,ω_n) (2μ - iω_n) ψ_(k,ω_n)`\nThe term `G_0⁻¹(k, ω_n) = (2μ - iω_n)` is the inverse free Green's function (or propagator) for this system.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe path integral is a product of Gaussian integrals over each mode `(k,ω_n)`. The result is given by the determinant of the operator `G_0⁻¹`.\n*   For **bosons** (commuting complex fields), `Z_B ∝ det⁻¹(G_0⁻¹)`.\n*   For **fermions** (anticommuting Grassmann fields), `Z_F ∝ det(G_0⁻¹)`.\n\nThis can be written in terms of the logarithm of `Z`:\n`ln Z = ∓ Tr[ln(G_0⁻¹)] = ∓ Σ_(k,n) ln(2μ - iω_n)`\n(Top sign `-` for bosons, bottom sign `+` for fermions).\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Matsubara Frequency Sum**\n\nThe sum is over all `M` degenerate states (labeled by `k`) and all Matsubara frequencies `n`.\n`ln Z = ∓ M * Σ_n ln(2μ - iω_n)`\n\nWe evaluate the sum `Σ_n ln(2μ - iω_n)` using standard Matsubara summation techniques.\n\n*   **For Bosons**: The Matsubara frequencies are `ω_n = 2nπ/β`. The summation yields:\n    `Σ_n ln(2μ - i(2nπ/β)) = ln(1 - e^(-2βμ))` (up to an irrelevant constant).\n    So, `ln Z_B = -M * ln(1 - e^(-2βμ)) = ln[(1 - e^(-2βμ))⁻ᴹ]`.\n    This gives the partition function:\n    `Z_B = (1 - e^(-2βμ))⁻ᴹ`\n    (This is valid for `2μ < 0`, or `μ < 0`, to ensure convergence).\n\n*   **For Fermions**: The Matsubara frequencies are `ω_n = (2n+1)π/β`. The summation yields:\n    `Σ_n ln(2μ - i((2n+1)π/β)) = ln(1 + e^(2βμ))` (up to an irrelevant constant).\n    So, `ln Z_F = +M * ln(1 + e^(2βμ)) = ln[(1 + e^(2βμ))ᴹ]`.\n    This gives the partition function:\n    `Z_F = (1 + e^(2βμ))ᴹ`\n\n---\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Hamiltonian Interpretation**: The key step is interpreting \"system with Hamiltonian H^=−μN^\" in the context of the GCE. Our analysis assumes `H_sys = -μN^`, which leads to an effective chemical potential of `2μ` in the partition function calculation.\n2.  **Particle Statistics**: The final expression for `Z` is fundamentally different for bosons and fermions due to their different statistics, which manifests in the path integral as commuting vs. anticommuting fields and in the Matsubara frequencies.\n3.  **Degeneracy (M)**: The result depends on `M`, the number of available single-particle states, which all have zero energy in this model. This parameter must be known for a specific physical system.\n4.  **Boson Convergence**: For the bosonic case, the result is only physically meaningful and mathematically convergent if the effective chemical potential is negative (`2μ < 0`), which prevents an infinite number of particles from occupying the zero-energy states (a form of Bose-Einstein condensation).\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function `Z` depends on the statistics of the particles (fermions or bosons) and the number of degenerate single-particle states, `M`.\n\n*   For **Fermions**: The partition function is `Z_F = (1 + e^(2βμ))^M`.\n*   For **Bosons**: The partition function is `Z_B = (1 - e^(-2βμ))^(-M)`, valid for `μ < 0`.\n\n<<<For fermions: Z = (1 + e^(2βμ))^M. For bosons: Z = (1 - e^(-2βμ))^(-M).>>>"
