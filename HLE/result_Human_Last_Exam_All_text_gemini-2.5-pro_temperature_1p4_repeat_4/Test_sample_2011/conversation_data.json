    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\n*   **Graph:** We are considering a graph `G` with a fixed number of vertices, `n = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices in which every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is a complete subgraph `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** A clique is always an induced subgraph. If `C` is a set of vertices forming a clique, the subgraph induced by `C` is precisely the complete graph `K_{|C|}`. The term \"induced subgraph\" here just reinforces the standard definition of a clique within a larger graph.\n*   **Different Clique Sizes:** We need to count the number of distinct values of `k` for which a `K_k` exists in the graph. For example, if a graph has cliques of sizes 3, 4, and 5, the number of different clique sizes is 3.\n*   **Objective:** Find the maximum possible value for this count (the number of different clique sizes) for any single graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n**2. Identifying the Core Property**\n\nLet's analyze the set of clique sizes that can exist in any graph `G`.\n\n*   Let `ω(G)` denote the **clique number** of `G`, which is the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n*   By definition, there exists a clique of size `ω(G)` in the graph `G`.\n*   Now, consider any integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ ω(G)`. Let `C_max` be a clique of size `ω(G)`. We can choose any subset of `k` vertices from `C_max`. Since every vertex in `C_max` is connected to every other vertex in `C_max`, any subset of its vertices will also have this property.\n*   Therefore, any subset of `k` vertices from `C_max` forms a clique of size `k`.\n*   This proves a critical point: **If a graph contains a clique of size `m`, it must also contain cliques of all sizes `1, 2, ..., m`**.\n\n**3. Simplifying the Problem**\n\nBased on the core property identified in the previous step, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G` is not just an arbitrary set of integers. It is always a set of the form `{1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`, where `ω(G)` is the clique number of the graph.\n\n*   The number of different clique sizes in `G` is therefore equal to the size of this set, which is simply `ω(G)`.\n*   The original question, \"determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\", is therefore equivalent to the simpler question: \"**What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices?**\"\n\n**4. Finding the Maximum Clique Number**\n\n*   A clique of size `k` requires `k` distinct vertices.\n*   A graph with `n` vertices can therefore not have a clique of size greater than `n`.\n*   For our case, with `n = 128`, the clique number `ω(G)` must satisfy `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n*   So, the maximum possible clique number is at most 128.\n\n**5. Constructing a Graph to Achieve the Maximum**\n\nTo confirm that 128 is the maximum possible number, we need to show that there exists a graph on 128 vertices that actually achieves this.\n\n*   Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`.\n*   In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n*   Therefore, the entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique.\n*   The size of the largest clique in `K_{128}` is 128, so `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n*   Following our analysis, the set of clique sizes in `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n*   The number of different clique sizes in this graph is 128.\n\n### Careful Points Summary\n\n*   **Key Insight:** The set of clique sizes in any graph is not arbitrary but is always of the form `{1, 2, ..., k}` for some `k`. This is because a subset of a clique is also a clique.\n*   **Problem Transformation:** The problem reduces from finding the size of a set of clique sizes to finding the maximum possible size of a single clique (the clique number).\n*   **Trivial Upper Bound:** The number of vertices `n` provides a simple and firm upper bound on the clique number.\n*   **Existence Proof:** The complete graph `K_n` is the canonical example that achieves this upper bound, proving that the maximum is attainable.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximum number of different clique sizes is equivalent to the maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices. The maximum possible clique number is 128, which is achieved by the complete graph `K_{128}`. This graph contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128, resulting in 128 different clique sizes.\n\n<<<128>>>"
