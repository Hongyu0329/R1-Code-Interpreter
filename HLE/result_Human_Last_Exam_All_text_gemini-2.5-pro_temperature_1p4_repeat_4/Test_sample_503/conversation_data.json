    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$ such that $L$ is left adjoint to $R$. We are asked to find the number of such adjunctions from the object $[23]$ to the object $[37]$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category.**\nThe simplex category $\\Delta$ has objects which are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. The morphisms are order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$, meaning if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n\nWhen viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, for any two morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a unique 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. We denote this by $f \\le g$. This turns each hom-set $\\text{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m], [n])$ into a poset.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the condition for an internal adjunction.**\nAn internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ that satisfy the adjunction conditions. In a locally posetal 2-category, these conditions simplify to:\n1.  $\\text{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$\n2.  $L \\circ R \\le \\text{id}_{[n]}$\n\nIn our specific case, $m=23$ and $n=37$. Let $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$. The conditions are:\n1.  For all $i \\in [23]$, $i = \\text{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i) = R(L(i))$.\n2.  For all $j \\in [37]$, $(L \\circ R)(j) = L(R(j)) \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}(j) = j$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the adjunction conditions to properties of the maps.**\nThese two conditions are the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$. In this context, an adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint map $L$ or the right adjoint map $R$. So, we can find the total number of adjunctions by counting the number of possible left adjoints $L$.\n\nA map between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). Similarly, a map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\nThe posets $[k]$ are finite total orders, and thus are complete lattices.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** For an order-preserving map between total orders, preservation of suprema of *non-empty* sets is automatically satisfied. The crucial condition is the preservation of the supremum of the *empty set*. The supremum of the empty set in a poset is its bottom element (if it exists).\n\nFor $L: [23] \\to [37]$ to be a left adjoint, it must preserve all suprema.\n-   The bottom element of $[23]$ is $0$.\n-   The bottom element of $[37]$ is $0$.\nThe preservation of the empty supremum means $L(0) = 0$. Since preservation of non-empty suprema is automatic for order-preserving maps on total orders, this is the only condition.\nSo, a left adjoint from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is an order-preserving map $L$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of such maps.**\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ satisfying $L(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map is defined by the sequence of its values:\n$L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$\nsuch that $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$ and each $L(i) \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we must have:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nThis means we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23 (for $L(1)$ through $L(23)$) where each value is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing items from a set with replacement, where order does not matter (as the non-decreasing condition sorts the sequence for us). This is a \"stars and bars\" or multiset coefficient problem.\n-   The number of items to choose is $k = 23$ (the values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$).\n-   The size of the set from which we choose is $n = 37 - 0 + 1 = 38$ (the values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$).\n\nThe number of such sequences is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n**Step 5: Verification (optional but recommended).**\nWe can verify this by counting the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\nA map $R$ is a right adjoint if it's order-preserving and preserves all infima.\n*   **Careful Point:** Similar to suprema, the crucial condition is preserving the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element of the poset.\n\nFor $R: [37] \\to [23]$ to be a right adjoint, it must satisfy $R(37) = 23$.\nWe count the number of order-preserving maps $R$ such that $R(37)=23$.\nThis means we need to find the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37)$ such that:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le R(37) = 23$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing a non-decreasing sequence of length 37 (for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$) with values from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n-   Number of items to choose, $k = 37$.\n-   Size of the set to choose from, $n = 23 - 0 + 1 = 24$.\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\nUsing the identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$. The two counts match, which confirms our reasoning.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is the number of possible left adjoint maps.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial[60, 23]>>>"
