    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n**Step 1: Set up a coordinate system for the cubes.**\nLet's place the first cube, Cube A, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can define its boundaries by the inequalities:\n*   $0 \\le x \\le 1$\n*   $0 \\le y \\le 1$\n*   $0 \\le z \\le 1$\nThis is a cube with a side length of 1, and one of its vertices is at the origin (0, 0, 0).\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift.**\nThe problem states that the two cubes are \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to each other\".\n*   **Main Diagonal:** The main diagonal of Cube A connects opposite vertices. A primary main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1). This diagonal can be represented by the vector $\\vec{d} = (1, 1, 1)$.\n*   **The Shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is interpreted as a displacement by a vector that is half of the main diagonal vector. This means the shift vector, $\\vec{s}$, is:\n    $\\vec{s} = \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{d} = \\frac{1}{2}(1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** An alternative interpretation could be that the *distance* of the shift is 1/2. The length of the main diagonal vector $\\vec{d}$ is $\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{3}$. A shift distance of 1/2 would correspond to a shift vector of magnitude 1/2 in the direction of $\\vec{d}$, which would be $\\frac{1/2}{\\sqrt{3}}(1,1,1)$. However, the phrasing \"by a factor of X along a vector V\" typically implies scalar multiplication (Factor * Vector), which leads to the first interpretation. This interpretation also leads to a much cleaner result, which is common in such problems. We will proceed with this more plausible interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Define the position of the second cube.**\nThe second cube, Cube B, is a translated version of Cube A. If we consider Cube A to be stationary, Cube B is shifted by the vector $\\vec{s} = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$.\nA point $(x, y, z)$ is inside Cube B if the point $(x - 1/2, y - 1/2, z - 1/2)$ is inside Cube A. This gives us the inequalities for Cube B:\n*   $0 \\le x - 1/2 \\le 1 \\implies 1/2 \\le x \\le 3/2$\n*   $0 \\le y - 1/2 \\le 1 \\implies 1/2 \\le y \\le 3/2$\n*   $0 \\le z - 1/2 \\le 1 \\implies 1/2 \\le z \\le 3/2$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the region of intersection.**\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point $(x, y, z)$ belongs to both Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we need to find the intersection of the inequalities for both cubes for each coordinate.\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must satisfy both $0 \\le x \\le 1$ (from Cube A) and $1/2 \\le x \\le 3/2$ (from Cube B). The overlapping interval is $1/2 \\le x \\le 1$.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must satisfy both $0 \\le y \\le 1$ and $1/2 \\le y \\le 3/2$. The overlapping interval is $1/2 \\le y \\le 1$.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must satisfy both $0 \\le z \\le 1$ and $1/2 \\le z \\le 3/2$. The overlapping interval is $1/2 \\le z \\le 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe intersection is a region defined by the combined inequalities:\n*   $1/2 \\le x \\le 1$\n*   $1/2 \\le y \\le 1$\n*   $1/2 \\le z \\le 1$\nThis describes a smaller cube. The length of each side of this intersection cube is the length of the intervals we found:\n*   Side length = $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$.\nThe volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\nVolume of intersection = $(1/2)^3 = 1/2 \\times 1/2 \\times 1/2 = 1/8$.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n1.  **Define Cubes:** Cube A is $[0,1]^3$.\n2.  **Define Shift:** The shift vector is interpreted as $\\vec{s}=(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$.\n3.  **Define Cube B:** Cube B is Cube A shifted by $\\vec{s}$, so it is $[1/2, 3/2]^3$.\n4.  **Find Intersection:** The intersection is the region where both sets of inequalities are met, which is $[1/2, 1]^3$.\n5.  **Calculate Volume:** The intersection is a cube of side length 1/2. Its volume is $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
