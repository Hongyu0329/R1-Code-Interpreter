    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark**\n\n1.  **Describe the Flag:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This means the flag is composed of exactly two colors: red and white.\n2.  **Representing a Flag as a Matrix:** A flag can be digitized and represented as a matrix of pixels. Each pixel's color can be represented by a vector in a color space (like RGB). For an image of height H and width W, we can form a matrix where each entry corresponds to a pixel's color vector.\n3.  **Understanding \"Maximal Rank\":** The question specifies that we must assume the values are chosen to make the rank *maximal*. The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its columns (or rows), which corresponds to the number of linearly independent columns (or rows). In the context of a flag's matrix, the \"maximal rank\" is achieved when each distinct color is represented by a linearly independent vector. For example, in the RGB color space, we could define Red as `(1, 0, 0)` and White as `(1, 1, 1)`. These two vectors are linearly independent.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** Since the Danish flag has two distinct colors (red and white), and we assume these colors are represented by linearly independent vectors to maximize the rank, the entire set of vectors in the flag's matrix will span a 2-dimensional space. Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n\n### **Step 2: Find African Flags with a Rank of 2**\n\nFollowing the logic from Step 1, we are looking for African national flags that are composed of exactly **two** distinct colors. We will now survey the flags of all African nations.\n\n### **Step 3: Survey of African National Flags by Color Count**\n\n*   **Flags with 1 Color:** None.\n*   **Flags with 2 Colors:**\n    *   **Morocco:** Red field with a green pentagram (star). (Colors: Red, Green). **Rank = 2.**\n    *   **Nigeria:** A vertical triband of green, white, and green. (Colors: Green, White). **Rank = 2.**\n    *   **Somalia:** A light blue field with a white five-pointed star. (Colors: Light Blue, White). **Rank = 2.**\n    *   **Tunisia:** A red field with a central white disk containing a red crescent and star. (Colors: Red, White). **Rank = 2.**\n*   **Flags with 3 Colors:** Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, DR Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone. These all have a rank of 3.\n*   **Flags with 4 or More Colors:** Cabo Verde, Central African Republic, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe. These all have a rank of 4 or higher.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the African nations whose flags have exactly two colors, and therefore a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2, are the same as the flag of Denmark. These nations are:\n*   Morocco\n*   Nigeria\n*   Somalia\n*   Tunisia\n\n<<<The flags of Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, and Tunisia.>>>"
