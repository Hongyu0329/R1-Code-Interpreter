    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules\n\nThe algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of a quiver of type $A_3$ with linear orientation. This is a finite-dimensional, hereditary algebra. The category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules, $\\text{mod}(A)$, is representation-finite.\n\nThere are 6 non-isomorphic indecomposable $A$-modules. We can denote them by $[i,j]$, representing a module with support on vertices $i, \\dots, j$ and identity maps on the arrows.\n1.  $S_1 = [1,1]$: Simple module at vertex 1. Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\to 0 \\to 0$. This is also the injective module $I_1$.\n2.  $S_2 = [2,2]$: Simple module at vertex 2. Representation: $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$.\n3.  $S_3 = [3,3]$: Simple module at vertex 3. Representation: $0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C}$. This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n4.  $[1,2]$: Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$. This is the injective module $I_2$.\n5.  $[2,3]$: Representation: $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$. This is the projective module $P_2$.\n6.  $[1,3]$: Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$. This is the projective module $P_1$ and the injective module $I_3$.\n\nThe simple modules are $S_1, S_2, S_3$. The number of simples is $n=3$.\n\n### Step 2: Define $\\tau$-tilting Modules and Slice Modules\n\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting Module**: For a hereditary algebra like $A$, a module $M$ is a (support) $\\tau$-tilting module if and only if it is a **tilting module**. A module $M$ is a tilting module if:\n    1.  The projective dimension of $M$ is at most 1 (this is always true for all modules over a hereditary algebra).\n    2.  $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M,M) = 0$.\n    3.  $M$ has $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands.\n\n    For hereditary algebras, the condition $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M,M)=0$ is equivalent to $\\text{Hom}_A(M, \\tau M) = 0$, where $\\tau$ is the Auslander-Reiten translation. A module satisfying this is called $\\tau$-rigid. So, a tilting module is a maximal $\\tau$-rigid module.\n\n*   **Slice Module**: A slice module is a special kind of tilting module. For a path algebra of a tree quiver (like our $A_3$ quiver), a theorem by Abe and Butler states that **a tilting module is a slice module if and only if it is sincere**.\n*   **Sincere Module**: A module $M$ is sincere if every simple $A$-module appears as a composition factor in $M$.\n\nCombining these points, the question simplifies to: **Find the unique tilting module that is not sincere.**\n\n### Step 3: Find Non-Sincere Tilting Modules\n\nA tilting module is of the form $T = M_a \\oplus M_b \\oplus M_c$, where $M_a, M_b, M_c$ are three non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. For $T$ to be non-sincere, its composition factors must be missing at least one of the simple modules $S_1, S_2, S_3$.\n\nLet's list the composition factors of the indecomposable modules:\n*   `Comp([1,1])` = {$S_1$}\n*   `Comp([2,2])` = {$S_2$}\n*   `Comp([3,3])` = {$S_3$}\n*   `Comp([1,2])` = {$S_1, S_2$}\n*   `Comp([2,3])` = {$S_2, S_3$}\n*   `Comp([1,3])` = {$S_1, S_2, S_3$}\n\nWe now search for a non-sincere tilting module by checking which simple module could be missing.\n\n**Case 1: $S_1$ is missing.**\nThe indecomposable summands of $T$ must be chosen from modules whose composition factors are contained in $\\{S_2, S_3\\}$. These are: $[2,2]$, $[3,3]$, and $[2,3]$.\nThis gives exactly one candidate for a basic module with 3 summands:\n$T_1 = [2,2] \\oplus [3,3] \\oplus [2,3]$.\nWe must check if $T_1$ is a tilting module, i.e., if $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_1, T_1)=0$. This is equivalent to checking $\\text{Hom}_A(T_1, \\tau T_1)=0$.\nThe summands of $T_1$ are $[2,2]$, $P_3=[3,3]$ and $P_2=[2,3]$. The Auslander-Reiten translation $\\tau M$ is zero for projective modules $M$. So $\\tau P_2 = \\tau P_3 = 0$.\nWe only need to compute $\\tau[2,2]$. The minimal projective resolution of $[2,2]$ is $0 \\to P_3 \\to P_2 \\to [2,2] \\to 0$. Applying the Auslander-Reiten functor gives $\\tau[2,2] = [1,1]$.\nSo, $\\tau T_1 = \\tau[2,2] \\oplus \\tau[3,3] \\oplus \\tau[2,3] = [1,1] \\oplus 0 \\oplus 0 = [1,1]$.\nWe check the condition $\\text{Hom}_A(T_1, [1,1])=0$:\n*   $\\text{Hom}_A([2,2], [1,1]) = 0$ (no map from a module supported at vertex 2 to one at vertex 1).\n*   $\\text{Hom}_A([3,3], [1,1]) = 0$.\n*   $\\text{Hom}_A([2,3], [1,1]) = 0$.\nThe condition holds. Thus, $T_1$ is a tilting module. Since it is missing $S_1$ as a composition factor, it is not sincere.\n\n**Case 2: $S_2$ is missing.**\nThe summands must be chosen from modules whose composition factors are in $\\{S_1, S_3\\}$. These are $[1,1]$ and $[3,3]$. We cannot form a module with 3 non-isomorphic summands from this set. Thus, there are no tilting modules missing $S_2$.\n\n**Case 3: $S_3$ is missing.**\nThe summands must be chosen from modules with composition factors in $\\{S_1, S_2\\}$. These are $[1,1]$, $[2,2]$, and $[1,2]$.\nThis gives the candidate: $T_2 = [1,1] \\oplus [2,2] \\oplus [1,2]$.\nLet's check if $T_2$ is tilting. We need to check $\\text{Hom}_A(T_2, \\tau T_2)=0$.\n$\\tau T_2 = \\tau[1,1] \\oplus \\tau[2,2] \\oplus \\tau[1,2]$.\n$[1,1]=I_1$ and $[1,2]=I_2$ are injective, so $\\tau[1,1]=\\tau[1,2]=0$. As before, $\\tau[2,2]=[1,1]$.\nSo, $\\tau T_2 = [1,1]$.\nWe check the condition $\\text{Hom}_A(T_2, [1,1])=0$:\n*   $\\text{Hom}_A([1,1], [1,1]) = \\mathbb{C} \\ne 0$.\nThe condition fails. Thus, $T_2$ is not a tilting module.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe search has yielded exactly one tilting module that is not sincere: $T_1 = [2,2] \\oplus [3,3] \\oplus [2,3]$. Since for this algebra \"slice module\" is equivalent to \"sincere tilting module\", $T_1$ is the unique tilting module which is not a slice.\n\nThe module is the direct sum of the simple module at vertex 2, the projective module at vertex 3 (which is also the simple at 3), and the projective module at vertex 2.\n$M = S_2 \\oplus P_3 \\oplus P_2$."
