    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the basic components of the category.**\nA category consists of objects and morphisms. The axioms of a category require composition of morphisms to be associative and the existence of an identity morphism for each object.\n\n*   **Objects:** We are given 2 objects. Let's call them `A` and `B`.\n*   **Morphisms:** We are given 4 morphisms.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the necessary morphisms.**\nFor every object, there must be an identity morphism. Since we have two objects, `A` and `B`, we must have two identity morphisms:\n1.  `id_A: A → A`\n2.  `id_B: B → B`\n\nThese are 2 of the 4 total morphisms. This leaves 2 other morphisms to be defined, let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\n**Step 3: Classify categories based on the distribution of morphisms.**\nLet `Hom(X, Y)` be the set of morphisms from object `X` to object `Y`. The total of 4 morphisms are distributed among `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(B, B)`, `Hom(A, B)`, and `Hom(B, A)`.\nLet `n_XY = |Hom(X, Y)|`. We know:\n*   `n_AA ≥ 1` (since `id_A` is in `Hom(A, A)`)\n*   `n_BB ≥ 1` (since `id_B` is in `Hom(B, B)`)\n*   `n_AA + n_BB + n_AB + n_BA = 4`\n\nAn isomorphism between two categories `C` and `D` must map objects to objects bijectively and morphisms to morphisms bijectively, preserving their structure. This implies that the tuple of hom-set sizes `(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA)` is an invariant, up to swapping the labels of the objects A and B. For instance, a category with tuple `(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA)` can be isomorphic to one with tuple `(n_BB, n_AA, n_BA, n_AB)`, but not to one with a tuple that cannot be obtained by this swapping.\n\nWe can list the possible tuples `(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA)` and group the ones that are isomorphic by swapping A and B.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze each case based on the hom-set size tuple.**\n\n**Case 1: `(3, 1, 0, 0)`**\n*   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f, g}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`. `Hom(A, B)` and `Hom(B, A)` are empty.\n*   This category is a disjoint union of two smaller categories. The structure is determined by the composition rules on `Hom(A, A)`, which must form a monoid of order 3.\n*   There are **5** non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each defines a unique, non-isomorphic category.\n*   The tuple `(1, 3, 0, 0)` is isomorphic to this case by swapping A and B.\n*   **Number of categories: 5**\n\n**Case 2: `(2, 2, 0, 0)`**\n*   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B, g}`. No morphisms between A and B.\n*   `Hom(A, A)` and `Hom(B, B)` must both be monoids of order 2. There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2: the group Z₂ (where `x² = id`) and the idempotent monoid (where `x² = x`).\n*   Let's denote them `G` and `S`. We can have the pairs `(G, G)`, `(S, S)`, and `(G, S)`. The pair `(S, G)` is isomorphic to `(G, S)` by swapping A and B.\n*   **Number of categories: 3**\n\n**Case 3: `(1, 1, 2, 0)`**\n*   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A}`, `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`, `Hom(A, B) = {f, g}`.\n*   There are no non-identity morphisms to compose, so the composition table is completely determined by the identity axioms (e.g., `id_B ∘ f = f`). Associativity is trivially satisfied.\n*   Since the structure is fixed once the hom-sets are defined, there is only one category of this shape up to isomorphism.\n*   The tuple `(1, 1, 0, 2)` is isomorphic to this one.\n*   **Number of categories: 1**\n\n**Case 4: `(2, 1, 1, 0)`**\n*   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(A, B) = {g}`.\n*   The set `Hom(A, A)` must be a monoid of order 2. So, `f ∘ f` is either `f` or `id_A`.\n*   We must also define the composition `g ∘ f: A → B`. The result must be in `Hom(A, B)`, which only contains `g`. Thus, we must have `g ∘ f = g`.\n*   We must check associativity for `g ∘ f ∘ f`:\n    *   `(g ∘ f) ∘ f = g ∘ f = g`\n    *   `g ∘ (f ∘ f)` is `g ∘ f = g` if `f ∘ f = f`, and `g ∘ id_A = g` if `f ∘ f = id_A`.\n    *   Associativity holds for both choices of `f ∘ f`.\n*   The two choices for the monoid structure on `Hom(A, A)` lead to two non-isomorphic categories.\n*   The tuple `(1, 2, 0, 1)` is isomorphic to this case.\n*   **Number of categories: 2**\n\n**Case 5: `(2, 1, 0, 1)`**\n*   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n*   Similar to the previous case, `Hom(A, A)` must be a monoid of order 2, giving two choices for `f ∘ f`.\n*   The composition `f ∘ g: B → A` must be `g`.\n*   Associativity holds for both choices. These two categories are not isomorphic to those in Case 4 because the hom-set tuples are not swappable.\n*   The tuple `(1, 2, 1, 0)` is isomorphic to this case.\n*   **Number of categories: 2**\n\n**Case 6: `(1, 1, 1, 1)`**\n*   `Hom(A, B) = {f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n*   We must define the compositions `g ∘ f: A → A` and `f ∘ g: B → B`.\n*   `g ∘ f` must be `id_A`, as it's the only morphism in `Hom(A, A)`.\n*   `f ∘ g` must be `id_B`, as it's the only morphism in `Hom(B, B)`.\n*   These compositions define an isomorphism between the objects A and B. The structure is completely determined and rigid. Associativity is satisfied.\n*   **Number of categories: 1**\n\n**Step 5: Sum the results.**\nWe sum the number of non-isomorphic categories from each unique case:\n*   Case 1: 5\n*   Case 2: 3\n*   Case 3: 1\n*   Case 4: 2\n*   Case 5: 2\n*   Case 6: 1\n\nTotal number of categories = 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
