    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher who meets three criteria:\n1.  They belong to the **Lviv-Warsaw School** of philosophy.\n2.  They analyzed the concept of a **\"hallmark\"** (or more generally, a \"sign\" or \"mark\").\n3.  They decomposed this concept into two distinct categories: **\"symptoms\"** and **\"signals\"**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\"**\nThe Lviv-Warsaw School was a highly influential movement in Polish philosophy and logic from the 1920s to the 1940s. It was founded by Kazimierz Twardowski. Its members are known for their emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and semantic analysis. Key figures include Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The philosopher we are looking for must be one of these, or a closely associated figure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Core Philosophical Concept**\nThe core of the question is the distinction between \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" as types of \"hallmarks\" or \"signs\". This falls under the philosophical field of **semiotics**, the study of signs and symbols.\n\n*   A **symptom** (or natural sign) has a natural, often causal, connection to what it signifies. The connection exists independently of human convention. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness.\n*   A **signal** (or conventional sign) has a connection to its meaning that is established by rule, agreement, or intention, typically for communication. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"cat\" is a signal for a certain type of feline animal.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Philosopher**\nWe need to find which member of the Lviv-Warsaw School is famous for making this specific semiotic distinction.\n\n*   **Kazimierz Twardowski**, the school's founder, laid the groundwork for precise conceptual analysis but is not primarily known for this specific semiotic distinction.\n*   **Alfred Tarski** and **Jan Łukasiewicz** were primarily formal logicians. While their work is fundamental to semantics, they did not focus on this particular pragmatic classification of signs.\n*   **Tadeusz Kotarbiński** worked on praxiology and reism. While his work involves signs and actions, he is not the originator of this specific distinction.\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the correct philosopher. He was a leading figure in the school who made significant contributions to logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. A central part of his work on pragmatic semiotics was the analysis of the concept of a \"sign\" (Polish: *znak*). He is precisely the philosopher who introduced and elaborated on the distinction between *oznaki* (symptoms or natural marks) and *sygnały* (signals). This distinction was fundamental to his theory of meaning and language.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nKazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School, analyzed the general notion of a sign (which encompasses the idea of a \"hallmark\" or distinguishing mark) and famously decomposed it into symptoms (natural signs based on a causal link) and signals (conventional signs based on rules or intention).\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
