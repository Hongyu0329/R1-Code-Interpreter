    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Duality Principle**\n\nWe are asked to reduce a given discrete-time system to its observer canonical form. The system is defined by matrices A and C:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe problem specifies using the principle of duality. The duality principle states that there is a deep connection between controllability and observability. Specifically, the problem of finding the observer canonical form for a system (A, C) is dual to the problem of finding the controller canonical form for its dual system (A^T, C^T).\n\nLet the original system be denoted by Σ = (A, C). Its state-space representation is:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nLet the observer canonical form be denoted by (A_o, C_o). This form is obtained by a state transformation z(k) = P * x(k), where P is an invertible transformation matrix. The new system matrices are:\nA_o = P * A * P⁻¹\nC_o = C * P⁻¹\n\nThe dual system, Σ_d, is defined by (A_d, B_d) where A_d = A^T and B_d = C^T. Its state-space representation is:\nz(k+1) = A_d * z(k) + B_d * u(k)\ny_d(k) = ...\n\nLet the controller canonical form for the dual system be (A_c, B_c). The duality principle states that the canonical forms are related by:\nA_o = A_c^T\nC_o = B_c^T\n\nTherefore, our task is to find the controller canonical matrix B_c for the dual system and then take its transpose to find the required matrix C_o.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Dual System**\n\nFirst, we write down the matrices for the dual system (A_d, B_d):\nA_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB_d = C^T = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\nThe dual system is a control problem with state matrix A_d and input matrix B_d.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Controllability Indices of the Dual System**\n\nTo find the controller canonical form, we first need to determine the controllability indices of the pair (A_d, B_d). The state dimension is n=3 and the input dimension is m=2.\nThe controllability matrix is W_c = [B_d, A_d*B_d, A_d²*B_d, ...]. Let the columns of B_d be b_1 and b_2.\nb_1 = [0, 1, 0]^T\nb_2 = [1, 1, 0]^T\n\nNow we compute A_d * b_1 and A_d * b_2:\nA_d * b_1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T\nA_d * b_2 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]^T = [3, 2, 1]^T\n\nThe controllability matrix is W_c = [b_1, b_2, A_d*b_1, A_d*b_2] = [[0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1, 1]].\nWe need to select n=3 linearly independent vectors from the columns of W_c, following a specific order (b_1, b_2, A_d*b_1, A_d*b_2, ...).\n1.  **b_1** = [0, 1, 0]^T. (Linearly Independent, LI)\n2.  **b_2** = [1, 1, 0]^T. (LI with b_1)\n3.  **A_d*b_1** = [2, 1, 1]^T. Let's check if this is LI with {b_1, b_2}. The matrix [[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]] has a determinant of -1, so the set is LI.\n\nWe have found a basis of 3 vectors: {b_1, b_2, A_d*b_1}.\nThe controllability index µ_i is the number of vectors in this basis that originated from the input b_i.\n-   Vectors from b_1: {b_1, A_d*b_1}. This gives µ_1 = 2.\n-   Vectors from b_2: {b_2}. This gives µ_2 = 1.\nSo, the controllability indices are (µ_1, µ_2) = (2, 1). The sum of the indices is 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the state dimension n.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Canonical Matrix B_c**\n\nThe structure of the controller canonical matrix B_c is determined by the controllability indices (µ_1, µ_2) = (2, 1). In the Luenberger controller canonical form, the B_c matrix has a very specific sparse structure. It has m=2 columns. Each column has at most one non-zero entry (a '1'). The '1' in the j-th column appears at the row index equal to the sum of the first j indices (µ_1 + ... + µ_j).\n\n-   For the first input (j=1), the '1' is in row µ_1 = 2.\n-   For the second input (j=2), the '1' is in row µ_1 + µ_2 = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThis defines the 3x2 matrix B_c as:\nB_c = [[0, 0],\n       [1, 0],\n       [0, 1]]\n\n**Step 5: Determine the New Matrix C using Duality**\n\nAccording to the duality principle, the new C matrix in the observer canonical form, C_o, is the transpose of the controller canonical matrix B_c of the dual system.\nC_o = B_c^T\n\nC_o = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]^T = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n\nThe resulting new matrix C is [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]].\n\n<<<[[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
