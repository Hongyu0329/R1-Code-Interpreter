    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand and Analyze the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts based on the parameter `t`:\n\n*   **Part 1: For `t` in the interval `[0, π]`**\n    *   In this interval, `b = 1`.\n    *   The parametric equations are `x = cos(t)` and `y = sin(t)`.\n    *   These equations satisfy `x² + y² = cos²(t) + sin²(t) = 1`. This is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n    *   As `t` goes from `0` to `π`, `y = sin(t)` is always non-negative (`y ≥ 0`).\n    *   This part of the curve traces the **upper semi-circle** of a unit circle, starting from `(1, 0)` (when `t=0`) and ending at `(-1, 0)` (when `t=π`).\n\n*   **Part 2: For `t` in the interval `(π, 2π)`**\n    *   In this interval, `b = 5`.\n    *   The parametric equations are `x = cos(t)` and `y = 5sin(t)`.\n    *   These equations satisfy `x² + (y/5)² = cos²(t) + sin²(t) = 1`, which simplifies to `x² + y²/25 = 1`. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of length 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of length 5 along the y-axis.\n    *   As `t` goes from `π` to `2π`, `y = 5sin(t)` is always non-positive (`y ≤ 0`).\n    *   This part of the curve traces the **lower semi-ellipse**, starting from `(-1, 0)` (as `t` approaches `π`) and ending at `(1, 0)` (as `t` approaches `2π`).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Bounding Box of the Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y`. This will define the smallest axis-aligned rectangle (the bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Finding the range of `x`:**\n    *   The equation for `x` is `x = cos(t)` for the entire interval `[0, 2π)`.\n    *   The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   Therefore, `x_min = -1` and `x_max = 1`.\n\n*   **Finding the range of `y`:**\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, `y = sin(t)`. The maximum value is `sin(π/2) = 1` and the minimum is `0`.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, `y = 5sin(t)`. The minimum value is `5 * sin(3π/2) = 5 * (-1) = -5`, and the maximum is `0`.\n    *   Combining these two ranges, the overall range for `y` is from -5 to 1.\n    *   Therefore, `y_min = -5` and `y_max = 1`.\n\n*   **Dimensions of the Bounding Box:**\n    *   The width of the figure is `Width = x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The height of the figure is `Height = y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Smallest Enclosing Square and its Area**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of dimensions 2 (width) by 6 (height). A square that encloses this rectangle must have a side length at least as large as the larger of these two dimensions.\n\n*   **Side length of the smallest enclosing square:**\n    *   `s = max(Width, Height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n*   **Area of this square:**\n    *   `Area = s² = 6² = 36`.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Piecewise Definition:** The value of `b` changes, which means the curve is composed of two different shapes. It's crucial to analyze each piece separately.\n2.  **Identify the Shapes:** Recognizing the first part as a semi-circle and the second as a semi-ellipse is key to understanding the figure's geometry.\n3.  **Extrema Calculation:** The extrema (`min` and `max` values) for `x` and `y` must be determined for the *entire* figure, not just one part. The overall y-range comes from combining the ranges of the two different functions for `y`.\n4.  **Bounding Box Dimensions:** The width and height of the bounding box are the total spans of the `x` and `y` coordinates, respectively (`x_max - x_min` and `y_max - y_min`).\n5.  **Smallest Square:** The side length of the smallest enclosing square is determined by the *larger* dimension of the bounding box.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe figure is a combination of an upper unit semi-circle and a lower semi-ellipse (`x²/1 + y²/25 = 1`).\nThe x-values range from -1 to 1, so the width is 2.\nThe y-values range from -5 (at the bottom of the ellipse) to 1 (at the top of the circle), so the height is `1 - (-5) = 6`.\nThe smallest enclosing square must have a side length equal to the maximum dimension, which is 6.\nThe area of this square is `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\n<<<36>>>"
