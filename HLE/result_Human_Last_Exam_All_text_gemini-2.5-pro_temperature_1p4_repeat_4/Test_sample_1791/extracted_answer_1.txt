Final Answer: The effective electron-electron interaction potential for a given momentum transfer $\mathbf{q}$ and Matsubara frequency $i\omega_n$, obtained by integrating out the phonon fields, is given by:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n) = -\sum_{j} \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m(w_q^2 + \omega_n^2)}$
This represents an attractive interaction between electrons mediated by phonons.
