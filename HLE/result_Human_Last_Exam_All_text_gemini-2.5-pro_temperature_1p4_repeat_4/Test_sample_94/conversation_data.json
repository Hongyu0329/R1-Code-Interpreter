    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the name of a specific physicist. The key identifying clues are:\n    *   A physicist.\n    *   Primarily known for work in microscopy.\n    *   Discovered or had a key insight into an optical effect.\n    *   This effect was seen in real imagery.\n    *   The initial observation was accidental and made by a custodial worker (or a similar role like a technician).\n    *   The context of the observation involved the cleaning of concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Anecdote:** The story of a janitor or technician accidentally revealing an optical phenomenon while cleaning equipment is a famous one in the history of science. This specific story is linked to the development of phase-contrast microscopy.\n\n3.  **Connect the Anecdote to a Physicist:** The physicist associated with this story is the Dutch scientist **Frits Zernike**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Details of the Story:**\n    *   **The Event:** While visiting the laboratory of physicist Robert W. Wood at Johns Hopkins University, Zernike observed a technician cleaning a large concave diffraction grating (a specialized type of mirror used to separate light into its constituent colors).\n    *   **The Observation:** As the technician wiped the grating, faint \"ghost\" spectral lines (an imperfection known as Rowland ghosts) appeared and disappeared.\n    *   **Zernike's Insight:** Others, including Wood, had seen this effect but dismissed it as a nuisance. Zernike, however, realized that these faint ghost images were out of phase with the main spectral lines. He understood that the dust and grease being wiped away were creating a phase-shifting layer, making the phase differences visible as differences in brightness.\n    *   **Connection to Microscopy:** This crucial insight—that an invisible phase shift could be converted into a visible amplitude (brightness) change—was the key principle he needed. He went on to develop the phase-contrast microscope, which does exactly this, allowing biologists to see transparent structures like living cells without staining them.\n\n5.  **Check all the Clues:**\n    *   **Physicist?** Yes, Frits Zernike was a physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953.\n    *   **Known for microscopy?** Yes, his Nobel was specifically \"for his demonstration of the phase-contrast method, especially for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope.\"\n    *   **Optical effect in real imagery?** Yes, the effect was observed with real spectral lines from a diffraction grating.\n    *   **Observed by a custodial worker?** Yes, the observation was made by a technician/janitor cleaning the equipment.\n    *   **Cleaning concave mirrors?** Yes, the object being cleaned was a concave diffraction grating.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** All the points in the question align perfectly with the story of Frits Zernike and the insight that led to his most famous invention.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
