    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_H^3$)**: This is an abelian group whose elements are oriented homology 3-spheres. Two homology spheres $M_1$ and $M_2$ represent the same element if they are homology cobordant, meaning there is an oriented 4-manifold $W$ with boundary $\\partial W = M_1 \\sqcup (-M_2)$ such that the homology groups of $M_1$ and $M_2$ inject into the homology of $W$. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure that creates a 3-manifold $S^3_n(K)$ from the 3-sphere by removing a tubular neighborhood of a knot $K$ and gluing it back with a twist determined by an integer $n$.\n*   **Homology Sphere Condition**: For the resulting manifold $S^3_n(K)$ to be a homology sphere, its first homology group, $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$, must be trivial. This requires $|n|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider $n=+1$ and $n=-1$ surgeries.\n\n### Step 2: List the knots\nWe need to consider all knots with four or fewer crossings. According to the standard knot tables (Rolfsen table):\n*   **0 crossings**: The unknot ($0_1$).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings**: There are no knots.\n*   **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($R3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($L3_1$).\n*   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, the knots to analyze are: the unknot, the right-handed trefoil, the left-handed trefoil, and the figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the surgery on each knot\nTo distinguish elements in $\\Theta_H^3$, we can use invariants. A powerful one is the Casson invariant, $\\lambda(M)$, which is an integer-valued invariant for integral homology spheres. If two manifolds have different Casson invariants, they represent different elements in $\\Theta_H^3$. The Casson invariant for a surgery manifold can be calculated using the knot signature, $\\sigma(K)$, and the second derivative of the Alexander polynomial, $\\Delta_K(t)$.\n\nThe relevant formula for +1 surgery is:\n$\\lambda(S^3_1(K)) = \\frac{\\sigma(K)}{2} - \\Delta_K''(-1)$\n(assuming the Alexander polynomial is normalized such that $\\Delta_K(t) = \\Delta_K(t^{-1})$ and $\\Delta_K(1) = 1$).\n\nWe will perform +1 and -1 surgery on each knot and compute the Casson invariant of the resulting homology sphere.\n\n**1. Unknot ($0_1$)**\n*   Properties: $\\sigma(0_1)=0$, $\\Delta_{0_1}(t) = 1$. So $\\Delta_{0_1}''(-1)=0$.\n*   **+1 surgery**: $S^3_1(0_1)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3$.\n    $\\lambda(S^3_1(0_1)) = \\frac{0}{2} - 0 = 0$.\n*   **-1 surgery**: $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ is also diffeomorphic to $S^3$.\n    $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(0_1)) = 0$.\n*   **Result**: The unknot produces only the identity element, $S^3$, with $\\lambda=0$.\n\n**2. Right-handed Trefoil ($R3_1$)**\n*   Properties: $\\sigma(R3_1)=-2$, $\\Delta_{R3_1}(t) = t^{-1}-1+t$. The second derivative is $\\Delta''_{R3_1}(t)=2t^{-3}$, so $\\Delta''_{R3_1}(-1)=-2$.\n*   **+1 surgery**: $S^3_1(R3_1)$ is the well-known Poincaré homology sphere.\n    $\\lambda(S^3_1(R3_1)) = \\frac{-2}{2} - (-2) = -1 + 2 = 1$.\n*   **-1 surgery**: For -1 surgery, we use the fact that $S^3_{-1}(K)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3_1(-K^{rev})$, where $-K^{rev}$ is the reverse of the mirror image of $K$. For the trefoil, $-K^{rev}$ is the other trefoil. So $S^3_{-1}(R3_1) \\cong S^3_1(L3_1)$. We will calculate this in the next step. Let's compute its invariant directly. The formula derived from the +1 surgery formula is $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(K)) = -\\frac{\\sigma(K)}{2} - \\Delta_K''(-1)$.\n    $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(R3_1)) = -\\frac{-2}{2} - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n*   **Result**: The right-handed trefoil produces two distinct homology spheres, one with $\\lambda=1$ and one with $\\lambda=3$.\n\n**3. Left-handed Trefoil ($L3_1$)**\n*   Properties: $L3_1$ is the mirror of $R3_1$. So, $\\sigma(L3_1) = -\\sigma(R3_1) = 2$. The Alexander polynomial is the same: $\\Delta_{L3_1}(t) = t^{-1}-1+t$, so $\\Delta''_{L3_1}(-1)=-2$.\n*   **+1 surgery**: $S^3_1(L3_1)$.\n    $\\lambda(S^3_1(L3_1)) = \\frac{2}{2} - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n    This manifold has $\\lambda=3$, the same as $S^3_{-1}(R3_1)$. Indeed, they are diffeomorphic.\n*   **-1 surgery**: $S^3_{-1}(L3_1)$.\n    $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(L3_1)) = -\\frac{2}{2} - (-2) = -1 + 2 = 1$.\n    This manifold has $\\lambda=1$, the same as $S^3_1(R3_1)$. They are also diffeomorphic.\n*   **Result**: The left-handed trefoil produces the same two homology spheres as the right-handed trefoil.\n\n**4. Figure-eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n*   Properties: $\\sigma(4_1)=0$, $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = t^{-1}-3+t$. The second derivative is $\\Delta''_{4_1}(t)=2t^{-3}$, so $\\Delta''_{4_1}(-1)=-2$. The knot is amphichiral.\n*   **+1 surgery**: $S^3_1(4_1)$.\n    $\\lambda(S^3_1(4_1)) = \\frac{0}{2} - (-2) = 2$.\n*   **-1 surgery**: $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$. Since $4_1$ is amphichiral and reversible, $S^3_{-1}(4_1) \\cong S^3_1(4_1)$. Let's verify with the formula:\n    $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = -\\frac{0}{2} - (-2) = 2$.\n*   **Result**: The figure-eight knot produces one type of homology sphere, with $\\lambda=2$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the distinct elements\nLet's collect all the distinct homology spheres we have produced, identified by their Casson invariants:\n*   From the unknot: a manifold with $\\lambda=0$.\n*   From the trefoils: manifolds with $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=3$.\n*   From the figure-eight knot: a manifold with $\\lambda=2$.\n\nThe set of Casson invariant values for all the homology spheres we can represent is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nSince the Casson invariant is a homology cobordism invariant, manifolds with different Casson invariants represent distinct elements in $\\Theta_H^3$. We have found four distinct values for the invariant. Therefore, we have found four distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\nThese elements are:\n1.  The identity element $[S^3]$, represented by surgery on the unknot.\n2.  The element $[S^3_1(R3_1)]$ (the Poincaré sphere).\n3.  The element $[S^3_{-1}(R3_1)]$.\n4.  The element $[S^3_1(4_1)]$.\n\nThese four elements are distinct. Thus, there are 4 elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n<<<4>>>"
