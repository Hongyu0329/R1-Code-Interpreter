    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most memory-efficient C program for the given problem and calculate the memory usage for its variables.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem\nThe core task is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings.\n*   **Input:** Two strings of equal length (1 to 100 characters), each on a new line. The strings contain only uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n*   **Comparison:** Lexicographical (like in a dictionary), but case-insensitive (e.g., 'A' is treated as 'a').\n*   **Output:**\n    *   \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n*   **Goal:** Write the most memory-efficient C program and find the total memory `m` (in bytes) used by its variables.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points for a Memory-Efficient Solution\n\n1.  **Input Handling:** The two strings are on separate lines. Standard input is a stream, so the first line must be read before the second line can be accessed. This implies that we must store the first string in memory to compare it against the second string later.\n2.  **Minimizing Buffers:** A naive approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays (e.g., `char s1[101], s2[101];`). This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes. A more memory-efficient approach is to store only the first string. The second string can be processed one character at a time as it is read from the input stream, without being stored in its entirety in an array.\n3.  **Choosing the Right Input Function:** To process the second string character by character, `getchar()` is the ideal function. For the first string, `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` is simple and effective.\n4.  **Selecting Optimal Data Types:** For any helper variables, like loop counters, we must choose the smallest possible data type that can safely hold the required range of values. The string length is at most 100, so a counter variable does not need to be a full `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n5.  **`getchar()` Return Type:** A critical detail is that the `getchar()` function returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is to accommodate the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value, which might not fit in a `char`. Therefore, the variable used to store the result of `getchar()` must be an `int`.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nBased on the points above, we can design the most memory-efficient program and calculate the memory used by its variables.\n\n**Variable 1: Buffer for the First String**\n*   We must store the first string. Its maximum length is 100 characters. In C, a string read with `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` is null-terminated (`\\0`).\n*   Required size: 100 characters + 1 null terminator = 101 elements.\n*   Declaration: `char s1[101];`\n*   Memory usage: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n**Variable 2: Loop Counter/Index**\n*   We need a variable to keep track of the current position in the first string (`s1`) as we compare it with characters from the second string.\n*   This index will range from 0 to 99 (for a string of length 100).\n*   The smallest integer type in C that can hold values from 0 to 99 is `unsigned char` (range 0-255).\n*   Declaration: `unsigned char i;`\n*   Memory usage: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**Variable 3: Variable to hold character from the second string**\n*   We will read the second string character-by-character using `getchar()`.\n*   As noted in the careful points, the variable storing the return value of `getchar()` must be an `int` to correctly handle `EOF`.\n*   Declaration: `int c2;`\n*   Memory usage: `sizeof(int)` (typically 4 bytes on contest systems) = **4 bytes**.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation**\nWe sum the memory usage of all necessary variables:\n*   Memory for `s1`: 101 bytes\n*   Memory for `i`: 1 byte\n*   Memory for `c2`: 4 bytes\n\nTotal Memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 4 = **106 bytes**.\n\nThis approach is the most memory-efficient because:\n*   It avoids allocating a 101-byte buffer for the second string.\n*   It uses the smallest possible data types for all other variables (`unsigned char` for the index).\n*   The buffer for the first string is unavoidable due to the input format.\n\n<<<106>>>"
