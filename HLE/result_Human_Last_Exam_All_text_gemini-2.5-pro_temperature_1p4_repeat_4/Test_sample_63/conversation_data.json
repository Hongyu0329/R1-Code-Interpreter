    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues in the Question**\nThe question provides three distinct clues to identify a specific person:\n1.  He was described by the author Kurt Vonnegut.\n2.  The description is that he \"looks like a porcupine\".\n3.  His name is two words, and both words begin with the same letter.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Common but Incorrect Answers (Red Herrings)**\nA quick search for \"Kurt Vonnegut\" and \"porcupine\" often leads to two well-known figures, but neither is the correct answer. It's important to see why they are incorrect.\n\n*   **Bob Dylan:** In his book *A Man Without a Country*, Vonnegut writes, \"If you want to see what a big-time, slap-up, fancy schmancy writerâ€™s office looks like, look at all the pictures of Bob Dylan. He looks like a porcupine in all of them.\" This fits the first two clues perfectly. However, his name, **B**ob **D**ylan, does not meet the third criterion, as the words start with 'B' and 'D'.\n*   **Richard Brautigan:** In his novel *Breakfast of Champions*, Vonnegut says of the poet Richard Brautigan, \"I might have been able to get a picture of his face for this book. It would have been a picture of a porcupine.\" This also fits the first two clues. However, his name, **R**ichard **B**rautigan, also fails the third criterion, as the words start with 'R' and 'B'.\n\n**Step 3: Perform a Deeper, More Careful Investigation**\nSince the common answers don't fit all the rules, we must look for a different, perhaps less famous, reference in Vonnegut's work. The key is finding a person who satisfies all three conditions simultaneously.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Correct Reference and Individual**\nThe correct reference is found in Kurt Vonnegut's 1979 novel, *Jailbird*. In the book, the narrator Walter Starbuck describes a person he once met:\n> \"I met the Sicilian Mahatma Gandhi, Danilo Dolci. There's a picture of him on the jacket of one of his books. **He looks like a porcupine.**\"\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Candidate Against All Clues**\nLet's check this individual, Danilo Dolci, against the question's criteria:\n1.  **Vonnegut connection:** Yes, he is explicitly mentioned and described in Vonnegut's novel *Jailbird*.\n2.  **Porcupine description:** Yes, the quote from the book is \"He looks like a porcupine.\"\n3.  **Name format:** His name is **D**anilo **D**olci. This is a two-word name where both words start with the same letter ('D').\n\nAll three conditions are met. Danilo Dolci was an Italian social activist, sociologist, and poet known for his non-violent opposition to poverty and the Mafia, and pictures confirm he had very short, bristly hair that matched the description.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe man described by Kurt Vonnegut as looking like a porcupine, whose name consists of two words starting with the same letter, is Danilo Dolci.\n\n<<<Danilo Dolci>>>"
