    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose container ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Terms:**\n    *   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** The date and time after which a compounded preparation should not be used. It is determined from the moment the sterile container is opened or manipulated.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** A container of a sterile medication intended for a single use. These containers, such as ampules, typically lack antimicrobial preservatives.\n    *   **Ampule:** A sealed glass container that is broken open to access its contents. Once opened, it cannot be resealed.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** An environment, such as an ISO Class 5 primary engineering control (e.g., a laminar airflow workbench), designed to prevent microbial contamination during compounding.\n\n2.  **Consult the Authoritative Standard (USP <797>):**\n    The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations\" provides the official guidelines for this scenario.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Nature of an Ampule:**\n    The most critical point is the type of container. An ampule is made of glass and must be broken at its neck to be opened. Once it is broken, it becomes an **open-system container**. It is completely exposed to the surrounding air and cannot be resealed to maintain sterility or protect against contamination.\n\n4.  **Apply the Specific USP <797> Rule for Ampules:**\n    The USP <797> standard is very specific regarding opened ampules. It states that:\n    *   Opened ampules must not be stored for any period.\n    *   The contents must be used immediately after the ampule is opened.\n    *   Any unused portion of the medication must be discarded immediately and cannot be saved for later use.\n\n5.  **Distinguish from Other Single-Dose Containers (Vials):**\n    It is important not to confuse an ampule with a single-dose *vial*. A single-dose vial has a rubber stopper that can be punctured with a needle. Even after puncture, it remains a closed system. For a single-dose vial punctured in a sterile (ISO Class 5) environment, the USP <797> guidelines allow for a BUD of **up to 12 hours**. However, this rule **does not apply** to ampules because they are open systems.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Ampule vs. Vial:** The primary point of caution is to recognize the difference between an ampule (open system) and a vial (closed system). The BUDs are different. The question specifically asks about an **ampule**.\n*   **\"Immediate Use\" Definition:** This means the administration of the drug must begin promptly after the ampule is opened and the dose is prepared. There is no acceptable storage time.\n*   **Irrelevance of Environment for Storage:** While opening the ampule and drawing up the dose must be done in a sterile environment to prevent contamination during the process, the sterile environment does not grant any storage time or extend the BUD for an opened ampule because it cannot be sealed.\n*   **No Preservatives:** Single-dose containers do not contain antimicrobial preservatives, making them highly susceptible to microbial growth if contaminated and stored.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the USP <797> guidelines, an opened ampule cannot be stored. Its contents must be used immediately, and any remaining portion must be discarded. Therefore, there is no storage time, and the BUD is effectively immediate.\n\n<<<An opened ampule cannot be stored and must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded."
