    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figure and his general stance.**\nThe question is about Pavel Milyukov. It's crucial to understand who he was. Milyukov (1859-1943) was a prominent Russian historian and, more famously, a liberal politician. He was the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets). As a rationalist, a historian, and a politically-minded public figure, he believed in progress, reason, and social responsibility.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the quote and its implications.**\nMilyukov is said to have denounced \"X-Ys\" as a \"stagnant swamp.\" This is a strong, negative metaphor.\n*   **\"Stagnant\"** implies a lack of movement, progress, or vitality.\n*   **\"Swamp\"** suggests something murky, unhealthy, decaying, and unproductive.\nCombining them, Milyukov is criticizing a group or movement for being self-absorbed, disconnected from real-world progress, and intellectually or morally unhealthy.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the historical context.**\nThe question refers to \"the Western culture of his time.\" Milyukov was most active from the 1890s through the 1920s. The dominant and controversial artistic and literary movements in Europe and Russia during this period (*fin de si√®cle* and early 20th century) were Symbolism and Decadence.\n\n**Step 4: Connect Milyukov's views with the cultural movements of the era.**\n*   **Symbolism and Decadence** were movements that turned away from realism and social commentary. They emphasized aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), individualism, mysticism, introspection, and often explored themes of morbidity, sin, and ennui.\n*   From the perspective of a progressive liberal and rationalist like Milyukov, these movements would seem like the exact opposite of what art and culture should be. He saw them as a retreat from civic duty and a dive into unproductive, self-indulgent navel-gazing.\n*   Therefore, the \"stagnant swamp\" metaphor is a perfect description of how a figure like Milyukov would view these artistic trends. He saw them as detached from the vital social and political struggles of the day.\n\n**Step 5: Identify \"X-Y\".**\nThe movements of Symbolism and Decadence were very closely linked, with the terms often being used together to describe the same phenomenon or overlapping groups of artists and writers. The hyphenated format \"X-Y\" strongly suggests a compound term used to describe a single entity. Milyukov, in his critiques, often lumped these two movements together.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on Pavel Milyukov's political and intellectual profile, the historical context of late 19th and early 20th-century culture, and the specific nature of his criticism (\"stagnant swamp\"), \"X-Y\" refers to the practitioners of the Symbolist and Decadent movements.\n\n<<<Symbolists-Decadents>>>"
