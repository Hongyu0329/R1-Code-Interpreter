    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct unit.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Game:** BAR (Beyond All Reason)\n    *   **Unit Type:** Flying Unit (an aircraft)\n    *   **Production Building:** Tier 1 Building (T1 Air Plant)\n    *   **Required Ability:** Must be able to shoot and stun enemy targets.\n\n2.  **Identify T1 Buildings for Flying Units:** In BAR, both factions (Cortex and Armada) have a T1 Air Plant, which is the Tier 1 building that produces flying units. We must check the unit rosters for both.\n\n3.  **Analyze Cortex Faction T1 Air Units:**\n    *   The Cortex T1 Air Plant produces the Vamp (fighter), Shuriken (gunship), Desolator (bomber), and Raven (scout).\n    *   **Vamp:** An anti-air fighter. Its weapons deal damage but do not stun.\n    *   **Shuriken:** An air-to-ground gunship. It fires plasma bombs that deal area-of-effect damage. While heavy explosions can cause knockback, this is not a true stun/paralysis effect.\n    *   **Desolator:** A bomber that drops conventional bombs. It deals damage but does not stun.\n    *   **Raven:** An unarmed scout and radar jammer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** No Cortex T1 flying unit has a dedicated stun attack.\n\n4.  **Analyze Armada Faction T1 Air Units:**\n    *   The Armada T1 Air Plant produces the Freedom Fighter (fighter), Thunder (gunship), Lark (bomber), Fink (scout), and the **Wasp** (paralyzer gunship).\n    *   **Freedom Fighter:** An anti-air fighter, similar to the Vamp. No stun.\n    *   **Thunder:** A gunship armed with rockets. Deals damage, but does not stun.\n    *   **Lark:** A bomber. No stun.\n    *   **Fink:** An unarmed scout.\n    *   **Wasp:** This is a specialized gunship. It is armed with a low-damage EMP (Electro-Magnetic Pulse) laser. The primary purpose of this weapon is to temporarily paralyze, or **stun**, enemy units, rendering them unable to move or fire.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The **Wasp** from the Armada faction is a flying unit produced from a T1 Air Plant, and its main attack is designed specifically to stun enemy targets.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Faction Difference:** It's crucial to check both Cortex and Armada, as their unit rosters are asymmetrical. The unit in question only exists for one faction.\n*   **Defining \"Stun\":** In BAR, \"stun\" typically refers to the paralysis effect caused by EMP weapons, which completely disables a unit. This is different from the pushback/impulse effect of heavy explosions. The Wasp's weapon is a textbook example of a stun weapon.\n*   **Verifying the Tier:** The Wasp is unambiguously a Tier 1 unit, available as soon as the Armada T1 Air Plant is built, with no additional research or upgrades required.\n\n<<<Wasp>>>"
