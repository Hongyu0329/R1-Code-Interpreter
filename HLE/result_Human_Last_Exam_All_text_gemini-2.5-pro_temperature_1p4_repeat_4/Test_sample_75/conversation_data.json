    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Event:** The question asks for the duration of the \"Second Great War\" in StarCraft lore. This conflict is the central focus of the *StarCraft II* trilogy and its epilogue. It is also referred to as the \"End War\".\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Point:** The Second Great War begins with the event that kicks off the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. This is the renewed Zerg invasion of the Terran-controlled Koprulu Sector, starting with the attack on Mar Sara. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this event occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Point:** The war concludes when its primary antagonist, the fallen Xel'naga Amon, is finally defeated for good. This ultimate confrontation takes place in the Void and is depicted in the *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, titled \"Into the Void\". The official timeline places the conclusion of this campaign and the end of the war in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Time Span:** The war starts in 2504 and ends in 2506. To calculate the duration, we need to consider the time elapsed between these two points.\n    *   The conflict was active during a portion of the year **2504** (*Wings of Liberty* and *Heart of the Swarm* campaigns).\n    *   The conflict continued through the entire year of **2505**, a period marked by the various factions regrouping, Amon's forces gathering strength, and the lead-up to the Protoss reclamation of Aiur.\n    *   The war's final major campaigns and conclusion occurred during a portion of the year **2506** (*Legacy of the Void* main campaign and its epilogue).\n\n5.  **Interpret the Duration and Apply Rounding:**\n    *   Since the war spans parts of 2504, all of 2505, and parts of 2506, its total duration is guaranteed to be more than one full year.\n    *   Let's consider a plausible scenario: If the war started in the spring of 2504 and ended in the summer of 2506, the total duration would be over two full years (e.g., approximately 2 years and 3 months).\n    *   Even if the campaigns themselves were short, the war officially starts in 2504 and ends in 2506, meaning the total time elapsed from start to finish is a value greater than two years.\n    *   The question requires the answer to be in years and **rounded up**. If the duration is any value greater than 2.0 years (e.g., 2.1 years, 2.5 years), rounding it up to the nearest whole year yields 3.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Second Great War starts in the year 2504 and ends in the year 2506. This means the conflict spans a period of time that is greater than two years. When rounding this duration up to the nearest whole year, the result is 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
