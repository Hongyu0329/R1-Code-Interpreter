    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the specific number of times Anton Chekhov describes Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question also correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic of the character's changing mentality.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Description\" in Context**\nFor this story, a \"description\" of the coat is not just about its physical appearance (e.g., color or fabric). It primarily refers to any action Otchumyelov takes with his coat—putting it on, taking it off, or wrapping it around himself. Each of these actions is a deliberate literary device used by Chekhov to signal a shift in Otchumyelov's attitude and judgment, reflecting his fear of offending someone powerful.\n\n**Step 3: Carefully Analyze the Text for Mentions of the Coat**\nLet's trace the mentions of the coat through the story chronologically.\n\n*   **Instance 1:** The story begins by establishing Otchumyelov's official presence. He is \"walking across the market square in a **new overcoat**...\" This initial description sets up the coat as a symbol of his authority.\n\n*   **Instance 2:** When it's suggested the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov becomes flustered and hot. He says, \"'It's hot! ... take my coat off...'\" The policeman Yeldrin helps him, and the text notes, \"**He takes off his greatcoat.**\" This is the first shift, moving from stern authority to cautious deference.\n\n*   **Instance 3:** When the crowd insists the dog is a stray, Otchumyelov's stance hardens again. He feels a chill and says, \"'I'm cold. ... Yeldrin, my lad, help me on with my coat...'\" The text describes him \"**...putting on his greatcoat**.\" He is literally putting his authority back on to deal with what he now perceives as a commoner's problem.\n\n*   **Instance 4:** A moment later, the policeman Yeldrin speculates that the dog might be the general's after all. Otchumyelov immediately reverses his position. He exclaims, \"'Help me off with my coat, Yeldrin... It's frightfully hot!'\" His authority is shed once more as fear of the general returns.\n\n*   **Instance 5:** The possibility arises that the dog belongs to the general's recently arrived brother. This is just as significant. Otchumyelov’s tone becomes gentle and servile. He says, \"'Put my coat on for me... the wind's getting up.... I feel a bit shivery....'\" He again puts on his coat, but this time his authority is used to protect the dog and its potentially influential owner.\n\n*   **Instance 6:** The final confirmation comes from the general's cook that the dog indeed belongs to the general's brother. Case closed. Otchumyelov, secure in his decision, walks away. The story concludes, \"**Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat** and continues on his way...\" This final action signifies that he has settled on his final \"color\" and is comfortably wrapped in the authority that aligns with the powerful.\n\n**Step 4: Tally the Instances**\nCounting these distinct moments where the coat is mentioned or its state is changed gives us a total of six times. Each instance directly corresponds to a pivot in Otchumyelov's investigation, driven entirely by his sycophantic and fearful nature.\n\n<<<6>>>"
