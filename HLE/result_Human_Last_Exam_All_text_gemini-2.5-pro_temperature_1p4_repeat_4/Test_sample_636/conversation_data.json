    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n\n*   We are given the state-space representation of a system with matrices:\n    *   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    *   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n*   The control law is a state feedback `u = -Fx`, where `F` is the feedback gain matrix.\n*   The closed-loop system is described by the state equation `x_dot = (A - BF)x`. The problem statement uses `A + BF`, which implies the feedback law is `u = +Fx`. However, standard control theory uses `u = -Fx`, and pole placement aims to place the eigenvalues of `A - BF`. We will assume the standard formulation `u = -Fx` and place the poles of `A-BF`. Let's define `A_cl = A-BF` and find `F` such that `A_cl` has the desired eigenvalues. *If we assume `u = Fx`, the final gain `F` would just be the negative of our result.* For this solution, we will calculate the gain `F` for `A_cl = A + BF` as requested in the prompt.\n*   **Goal:** Find a 2x2 gain matrix `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. If the desired eigenvalues are `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`, the desired characteristic polynomial `p_d(λ)` is:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**3. Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl`**\n\nThe closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`. Let `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, add `A` to `BF`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2f3, 1 + f2 + 2f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**4. Determine the Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is `λ^2 - tr(M)λ + det(M)`.\n*   **Trace of `A_cl`:**\n    `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3) + (f2) = f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1`\n*   **Determinant of `A_cl`:**\n    `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 - 1`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is:\n`p(λ) = λ^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1)λ + (-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 - 1)`\n\n**5. Equate the Polynomials and Solve for `F`**\n\nWe now match the coefficients of our calculated polynomial `p(λ)` with the desired polynomial `p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n1.  **λ Coefficient:** `-(f1 + f2 + 2f3 - 1) = 2`  =>  `f1 + f2 + 2f3 = -1`\n2.  **Constant Term:** `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 - 1 = 2` => `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3`\n\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This indicates that there is no unique solution for `F`, and we have the freedom to choose some values to simplify the problem.\n\n**Simplification:** Let's assume that we only use the first input channel, which means the feedback for the second input is zero. This corresponds to setting the second row of `F` to zero.\nLet `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n\nNow the two equations become:\n1.  `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1`  =>  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2(0) - 2(0) - 2*f1(0) = 3`  =>  `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nWe now have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1) `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2) `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\n**Solve the simplified system:**\nAdd equation (1) to equation (2):\n`(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into equation (1):\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\n**6. Construct the Final Answer**\n\nWe found `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, and we assumed `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\nTherefore, a valid state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Careful Points & Verification:**\n*   **Controllability:** The system must be controllable to arbitrarily place the poles. The controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]` has rank 2, so the system is controllable.\n*   **Uniqueness:** The problem for multi-input systems generally has non-unique solutions for `F`. Our simplification (`f3=0, f4=0`) is a valid way to find one of the possible solutions.\n*   **Verification:** Let's check our result. With `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`, the closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`.\n    The characteristic polynomial of this `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl) = det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`. This matches the desired polynomial, so our solution is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
