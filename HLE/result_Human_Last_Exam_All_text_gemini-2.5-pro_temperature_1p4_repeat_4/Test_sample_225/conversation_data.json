    "**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Identify the parametric curve:**\n    The curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n    x(t) = cos(9t)\n    y(t) = sin(5t)\n    This is a specific type of curve known as a Lissajous curve.\n\n2.  **Understand the condition for self-intersection:**\n    A self-intersection occurs when the curve passes through the same physical point (x, y) at two different parameter values, t1 and t2. This means we are looking for the number of distinct points (x, y) for which there exist t1 ≠ t2 such that:\n    x(t1) = x(t2)\n    y(t1) = y(t2)\n\n3.  **Determine the period of the curve:**\n    The period of x(t) = cos(9t) is Tx = 2π/9.\n    The period of y(t) = sin(5t) is Ty = 2π/5.\n    The entire curve is traced out over the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods.\n    T = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCD(9, 5)) = 2π / 1 = 2π.\n    So, we consider the parameter t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n4.  **Use the standard formula for Lissajous curves:**\n    For Lissajous curves of the form x(t) = A sin(at + δ) and y(t) = B sin(bt), there are well-known formulas for the number of self-intersection points, provided that a and b are rational. In our case, we have integers a=9 and b=5.\n\n5.  **Check the conditions for the specific formula:**\n    Our curve is x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t). We can rewrite x(t) as x(t) = sin(9t + π/2).\n    So, the curve fits the general form with a = 9, b = 5, and phase shift δ = π/2.\n\n    The applicable formula depends on the properties of a and b:\n    *   **Coprimality:** We find the greatest common divisor of a and b. GCD(9, 5) = 1. So, they are coprime.\n    *   **Parity:** Both a=9 and b=5 are odd integers.\n    *   **Phase Shift:** The phase shift is δ = π/2.\n\n6.  **Apply the correct formula:**\n    For a Lissajous curve with parameters 'a' and 'b' that are both odd and coprime:\n    *   If the form is sin/sin (i.e., x=sin(at), y=sin(bt)), the number of self-intersections is (ab - a - b + 1)/2 or simply (a-1)(b-1)/2. This counts the number of inner loops. The origin is a point of high multiplicity.\n    *   If the form is sin/cos (i.e., x=sin(at), y=cos(bt) or x=cos(at), y=sin(bt)), which corresponds to a phase shift of δ=π/2, the formula for the number of self-intersection points is:\n        N = (ab - 1) / 2\n\n7.  **Calculate the number of self-intersection points:**\n    Using the formula with a = 9 and b = 5:\n    N = (9 * 5 - 1) / 2\n    N = (45 - 1) / 2\n    N = 44 / 2\n    N = 22\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify the type of Lissajous curve (sin/sin vs sin/cos) as the formula for the number of intersections is different. Our case x=cos(9t), y=sin(5t) falls into the sin/cos category.\n*   The parameters 'a' and 'b' must be coprime for this simple formula to apply directly. If they were not, the curve would trace the same path multiple times.\n*   The direct method of solving the system of trigonometric equations for t1 and t2 is much more complex because it first finds the number of crossing *events*, not the number of unique crossing *points*. Multiple crossing events can happen at the same physical point if it's a point of higher multiplicity (e.g., a triple point). The formula conveniently bypasses this complexity.\n*   The formula counts the number of distinct Cartesian points (x, y) where the curve crosses itself.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe curve is (cos(9t), sin(5t)). This is a Lissajous curve with parameters a=9 and b=5.\nSince a and b are both odd and coprime, and the form is cos/sin, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula N = (ab-1)/2.\nN = (9 * 5 - 1) / 2 = (45 - 1) / 2 = 44 / 2 = 22.\n\n<<<22>>>"
