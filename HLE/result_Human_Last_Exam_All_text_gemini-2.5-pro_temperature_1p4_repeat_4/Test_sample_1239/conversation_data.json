    "This problem asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The dimension of a Lie group is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is the number of independent infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformations.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the equations**\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are given by the system of partial differential equations:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, the density $\\rho$ has been absorbed into the pressure term ($p \\to p/\\rho$) and $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. The independent variables are time $t$ and space coordinates $\\mathbf{x}=(x_1, x_2, x_3)$. The dependent variables are the velocity components $u_1, u_2, u_3$ and the pressure $p$. We are looking for point symmetries, which are transformations of these variables that map solutions to other solutions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the generators of the symmetry group**\n\nWe can find the generators of the Lie algebra by systematically looking for transformations that leave the equations invariant. This can be done by inspection or through the algorithmic Lie symmetry method. We list the known generators.\n\n1.  **Time translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$), so they are invariant under time shifts $t \\to t + s$. This gives one generator.\n    *   $X_t = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ (1 dimension)\n\n2.  **Space translations:** The equations have constant coefficients and are defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they are invariant under spatial shifts $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$. This gives three independent generators.\n    *   $X_{x_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 dimensions)\n\n3.  **Space rotations:** The equations are covariant under rotations of the coordinate system, $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$ for $R \\in SO(3)$. The group of rotations $SO(3)$ is 3-dimensional.\n    *   $R_{ij} = x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} - x_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_j} - u_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}, i<j$. (3 dimensions)\n\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame. The transformation is $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$, while $t$ and $p$ remain unchanged. This gives three generators, one for each direction of the boost velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$.\n    *   $G_i = t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. (3 dimensions)\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation):** The Navier-Stokes equations possess a scaling symmetry. Let's consider a transformation of the form $t \\to \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\lambda^d p$. By substituting these into the equations and requiring invariance, we find a relationship between the exponents.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}$ scales as $\\lambda^{c-a}$.\n    *   $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}$ scales as $\\lambda^{2c-b}$.\n    *   $\\nabla p$ scales as $\\lambda^{d-b}$.\n    *   $\\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$ scales as $\\lambda^{c-2b}$.\n    For the equation to be invariant, the scaling exponents of all terms must be equal: $c-a = 2c-b = d-b = c-2b$.\n    *   From $2c-b = c-2b$, we get $c = -b$.\n    *   From $c-a = c-2b$, we get $a = 2b$.\n    *   From $d-b = c-2b$, we get $d = c-b = -b-b = -2b$.\n    This yields a single one-parameter group of scaling transformations, as all exponents are determined by one (say, $b$). We can set $b=1$, which gives $a=2, c=-1, d=-2$. The corresponding infinitesimal generator is:\n    *   $D = 2t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ (1 dimension)\n\n**Step 3: Consider any infinite-dimensional symmetries**\n\nThe pressure $p$ only appears in the momentum equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This means that if we transform $p \\to p + h(t)$, where $h(t)$ is any arbitrary function of time, the term $\\nabla(p+h(t)) = \\nabla p + \\nabla h(t) = \\nabla p$ remains unchanged. Thus, the transformation $p \\to p + h(t)$ is a symmetry for any function $h(t)$. The infinitesimal generators for these symmetries are $h(t)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$. Since $h(t)$ is an arbitrary function, this constitutes an infinite-dimensional abelian ideal within the full symmetry algebra.\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the question and calculate the final dimension**\n\nQuestions asking for \"the dimension\" of the symmetry group of a PDE that possesses such \"trivial\" infinite-dimensional symmetries (often related to gauge freedom or linearity) are conventionally understood to be asking for the dimension of the maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra. We ignore the infinite-dimensional part related to the pressure shift.\n\nBy summing the dimensions of the finite-dimensional generators found in Step 2, we get the dimension of the group.\nDimension = (Time translation) + (Space translations) + (Rotations) + (Galilean boosts) + (Scaling)\nDimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\nThe maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations has dimension 11."
