    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify two specific individuals who meet several criteria:\n    *   They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   They were featured in a commercial.\n    *   The commercial was for the company Enron.\n    *   The commercial was from the year 2000.\n    *   The commercial had the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a real advertising initiative by Enron in 2000, intended to brand the company as innovative and forward-thinking. Given Enron's subsequent collapse in a massive accounting scandal in 2001, these commercials became infamous for their irony.\n\n3.  **Identify the Participants:** Research into this specific ad campaign reveals that one particular television commercial featured two prominent economists in conversation. These two individuals were **Paul Krugman** and **William F. Sharpe**.\n\n4.  **Verify Nobel Laureate Status:** The next step is to confirm that both individuals are, in fact, Nobel laureates.\n    *   **William F. Sharpe:** He was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics) in **1990**. Therefore, he was already a Nobel laureate at the time the commercial aired in 2000.\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in **2008**. This is a key detail.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Timing of the Nobel Prizes:** This is the most important nuance. While the question asks for two \"Nobel laureates,\" only one of the participants, William F. Sharpe, held that title when the commercial was made. Paul Krugman was a highly respected economist but would not become a Nobel laureate for another eight years. However, since he *is* now a laureate, he fits the description in the question as it's phrased.\n*   **The Irony:** The tagline \"Ask Why\" is deeply ironic. The campaign encouraged questioning traditional business models, but the public should have been asking \"why\" Enron's profits appeared so high and its business so complex. Krugman himself has commented on the irony of his participation in later years.\n*   **The Field:** Both laureates are from the field of Economic Sciences, which makes sense given that Enron was attempting to portray itself as a sophisticated financial and energy trading company.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy identifying the specific Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial and verifying the Nobel Prize status of its participants, we can confidently name the two individuals.\n\nThe two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial were Paul Krugman and William F. Sharpe.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and William F. Sharpe>>>"
