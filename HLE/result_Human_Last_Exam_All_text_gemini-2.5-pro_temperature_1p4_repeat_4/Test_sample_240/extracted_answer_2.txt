The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance during a bench test is that it is in its default, power-off state, which is an actively decoupled or detuned mode. This is a safety feature, typically implemented with PIN diodes, to prevent the coil from coupling with the scanner's high-power transmit pulse. Without the specific DC control signals and preamplifier power that the MRI scanner provides, the coil is intentionally non-resonant, and thus its resonance cannot be detected by the external probe.
