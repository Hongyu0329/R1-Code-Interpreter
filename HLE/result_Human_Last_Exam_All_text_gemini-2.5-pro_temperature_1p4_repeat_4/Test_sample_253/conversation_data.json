    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the binary pattern for Cellular Automaton Rule 110 after 20 iterations, starting from a single cell in state 1.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Rule 110\n\nA one-dimensional cellular automaton's state at the next step is determined by the state of a cell and its immediate left and right neighbors. There are $2^3 = 8$ possible neighborhood patterns of 0s and 1s. Rule 110 is named after the binary representation of the decimal number 110, which is `01101110`. We map this binary string to the 8 neighborhoods, which are typically ordered from `111` down to `000`. The corresponding bit gives the next state of the central cell.\n\nThe rule table is as follows:\n\n| Current Neighborhood | Next State of Center Cell |\n| :------------------: | :-----------------------: |\n| `111`                |             0             |\n| `110`                |             1             |\n| `101`                |             1             |\n| `100`                |             0             |\n| `011`                |             1             |\n| `010`                |             1             |\n| `001`                |             1             |\n| `000`                |             0             |\n\n### Step 2: Set the Initial State\n\nThe simulation starts from a single cell in state 1 on an infinite background of 0s.\n*   **Generation 0:** `...0001000...`\nFor calculation, we only need to consider the \"active\" part of the pattern, assuming that any cell outside this pattern is in state 0. The active pattern at Generation 0 is simply `1`.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Rule for 20 Generations\n\nWe will now calculate the pattern for each generation. At each step, we consider the current pattern and pad it with zeros on both sides to calculate the neighborhoods for the cells in the next generation. The pattern can grow by at most one cell on each side per generation.\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `1`\n*   **Generation 1:** Based on the padded state `00100`. Neighborhoods are `001`, `010`, `100`. This produces `110`.\n*   **Generation 2:** From `0011000`. Produces `1110`.\n*   **Generation 3:** From `00111000`. Produces `11010`.\n*   **Generation 4:** From `001101000`. Produces `111110`.\n*   **Generation 5:** From `0011111000`. Produces `1100010`.\n*   **Generation 6:** From `00110001000`. Produces `11100110`.\n*   **Generation 7:** From `001110011000`. Produces `110101110`.\n*   **Generation 8:** From `0011010111000`. Produces `1111110010`.\n*   **Generation 9:** From `00111111001000`. Produces `11000010110`.\n*   **Generation 10:** From `001100001011000`. Produces `111000111110`.\n*   **Generation 11:** From `0011100011111000`. Produces `1101001100010`.\n*   **Generation 12:** From `00110100110001000`. Produces `11111011100110`.\n*   **Generation 13:** From `001111101110011000`. Produces `110001110101110`.\n*   **Generation 14:** From `0011000111010111000`. Produces `1110011011111010`.\n*   **Generation 15:** From `00111001101111101000`. Produces `11010111110001110`.\n*   **Generation 16:** From `001101011111000111000`. Produces `111111100010011010`.\n*   **Generation 17:** From `0011111110001001101000`. Produces `110000010011011110`.\n*   **Generation 18:** From `0011000001001101111000`. Produces `1110000110111110010`.\n*   **Generation 19:** From `00111000011011111001000`. Produces `11010001111100010110`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Pattern (Generation 20)\n\nWe apply the rule one last time to the pattern from Generation 19.\n*   **Current Pattern (Gen 19):** `11010001111100010110`\n*   **Padded for Calculation:** `001101000111110001011000`\n\nWe calculate the next state for each new cell by looking at the 3-cell neighborhood in the padded string above it.\n*   `001` -> **1**\n*   `011` -> **1**\n*   `110` -> **1**\n*   `101` -> **1**\n*   `010` -> **1**\n*   `100` -> **0**\n*   `000` -> **0**\n*   `001` -> **1**\n*   `011` -> **1**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `110` -> **1**\n*   `100` -> **0**\n*   `000` -> **0**\n*   `001` -> **1**\n*   `010` -> **1**\n*   `101` -> **1**\n*   `011` -> **1**\n*   `110` -> **1**\n*   `100` -> **0**\n\nAssembling these new states gives the final pattern.\n\n**Final Pattern (Generation 20):** `111110011000100111110`\n\n<<<111110011000100111110>>>"
