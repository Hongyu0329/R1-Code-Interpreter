    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. For the purpose of natural abundance on Earth, we consider the following:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*Oganesson (Og) is also a noble gas but is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is excluded from this analysis.*\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\" in \"2002\".\n*   **\"All terrestrial matter\"**: This implies we should consider the total amount of each gas in the Earth's major reservoirs: the atmosphere, the crust, and the hydrosphere (oceans).\n*   **\"in 2002\"**: The natural abundances of elements on Earth do not change significantly on a year-to-year basis. Therefore, the specific year 2002 does not change the answer, and we can use standard, well-established abundance data.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Stable Noble Gases**\nFirst, let's compare the non-radioactive (or very long-lived) noble gases. Their primary reservoir is the atmosphere, with smaller amounts trapped in the Earth's crust.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar)**: It is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.93% of the Earth's atmosphere by volume.\n*   **Neon (Ne)**: The second most abundant, at about 18 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere.\n*   **Helium (He)**: While continuously produced by radioactive decay in the crust and lost to space from the upper atmosphere, it maintains an atmospheric concentration of about 5 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr)**: Much rarer, at about 1.1 ppm in the atmosphere.\n*   **Xenon (Xe)**: The rarest of the stable noble gases, with an atmospheric concentration of only about 0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion).\n\nBased on this comparison of the stable noble gases, **Xenon** is the rarest.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Abundance of Radon (Rn)**\nNow, we must consider Radon. This is the crucial step.\n*   **Radioactivity and Half-life**: Radon is a radioactive element. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Secular Equilibrium**: Radon is constantly being formed as a decay product of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. However, because it decays so quickly, it never accumulates in large quantities. It exists in a \"secular equilibrium,\" where its rate of decay is equal to its rate of formation.\n*   **Total Mass**: Due to this rapid decay, the total amount of radon gas present on the entire planet (in the crust, atmosphere, and oceans combined) at any given moment is extremely small. Estimates place the total mass of radon in the Earth's atmosphere at a few tens of kilograms at most. The total amount in the entire terrestrial environment is estimated to be on the order of tonnes.\n\n**Step 5: Compare All Noble Gases and Conclude**\nLet's compare the total estimated mass of Xenon with that of Radon.\n*   **Total Mass of Xenon (Xe)**: Approximately 2 x 10^12 kg.\n*   **Total Mass of Radon (Rn)**: On the order of 10^3 to 10^5 kg (tonnes).\n\nThe total mass of Radon on Earth is many millions of times smaller than the total mass of Xenon. Therefore, despite being constantly produced, its ephemeral nature makes it the rarest of all the noble gases.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The key is to distinguish between stable elements that have accumulated over geological time (like Xenon) and highly radioactive elements that cannot accumulate (like Radon).\n*   The phrasing \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\" simply means we need to compare the total quantity of each gas on a planetary scale.\n*   The year 2002 is not a deciding factor, as these abundances are effectively constant on human timescales.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon due to its radioactivity and extremely short half-life, which prevents it from accumulating in any significant quantity.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
