    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a d=3 system using the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the problem and relevant concepts**\n\nThe question asks for the specific heat critical exponent, denoted by $\\alpha$. This exponent describes how the specific heat at constant volume ($C_V$) diverges or behaves near a critical point, such as the Curie temperature ($T_c$) in a ferromagnet. The scaling law is:\n\n$C_V \\sim |T - T_c|^{-\\alpha}$\n\nThe method to be used is the **epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion**, a key technique in the **Renormalization Group (RG) theory**. This method involves performing calculations in a dimension $d$ that is slightly different from the **upper critical dimension** ($d_c$) and then expanding the results as a power series in the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the system parameters and upper critical dimension**\n\n*   The problem does not specify a particular physical system. In the context of critical phenomena, the default and most fundamental model is the **Ising model**, which is described by the $\\phi^4$ field theory. This theory is a member of the more general O(N) vector model family, with the Ising model corresponding to N=1.\n*   For the $\\phi^4$ theory, the upper critical dimension is **$d_c = 4$**. Above this dimension, the predictions of mean-field theory are exact ($\\alpha=0$). We are interested in fluctuations below $d_c$.\n*   The spatial dimension is given as **$d=3$**.\n*   Therefore, the expansion parameter is **$\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$**.\n\n**Step 3: Use the hyperscaling relation**\n\nCritical exponents are not all independent; they are connected by scaling relations. A crucial one is the **hyperscaling relation**, which connects the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to the spatial dimension $d$ and the correlation length exponent $\\nu$:\n\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ governs the divergence of the correlation length $\\xi \\sim |T - T_c|^{-\\nu}$. To find $\\alpha$, we first need to determine $\\nu$ using the $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ to leading order in $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe RG analysis of the O(N) model near the Wilson-Fisher fixed point yields the critical exponents as series in $\\epsilon$. To the first (leading) order in $\\epsilon$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ is given by:\n\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 5: Derive the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to leading order in $\\epsilon$**\n\nNow we can derive $\\alpha$ by substituting the expressions for $d$ and $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$:\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n\nWe expand this expression and keep only terms up to the first power of $\\epsilon$:\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ (4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) + \\left( 4 \\cdot \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)} - 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\left( \\frac{N+2}{N+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2(N+2) - (N+8)}{2(N+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{2N + 4 - N - 8}{2(N+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{N - 4}{2(N+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nThis gives the general first-order formula for $\\alpha$:\n\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final numerical value**\n\nTo get a numerical answer, we use the parameters for our specific case:\n*   The system is in $d=3$, so $\\epsilon = 1$.\n*   We assume the system has Ising symmetry, so $N=1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $\\alpha$:\n\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Assumption of Ising Model (N=1):** The result depends on the symmetry of the order parameter, N. The Ising model is the standard assumption for such a general question, but for other models like the XY model (N=2) or Heisenberg model (N=3), the result would be different.\n2.  **Validity of the $\\epsilon$-Expansion:** The expansion is technically valid only for small $\\epsilon$. In our case, $\\epsilon = 1$, which is not small. Therefore, the leading-order result is an approximation.\n3.  **Higher-Order Corrections:** While the $\\epsilon$-expansion can be carried out to higher orders, the resulting series is asymptotic. For $\\epsilon=1$, simply adding more terms does not necessarily improve the result and requires sophisticated resummation techniques. The modern, highly accurate value for $\\alpha$ in the 3D Ising model is $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$, which is close to our first-order estimate of $1/6 \\approx 0.167$. The leading-order calculation correctly captures the sign and order of magnitude of the exponent.\n4.  **Interpretation:** The question asks for the value *using* the epsilon expansion. This typically means providing the result of the simplest, leading-order calculation, which is a celebrated result of RG theory.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the leading-order result from the epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ in a d=3 Ising-like system is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
