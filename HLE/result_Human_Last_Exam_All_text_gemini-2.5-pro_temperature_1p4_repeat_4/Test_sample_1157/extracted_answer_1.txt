The specific procedures for her management begin with immediate medical stabilization, including an urgent referral to a physician to manage her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%), alongside prophylactic antibiotics and local wound debridement. Definitive treatment involves replacing the missing teeth (left lateral incisor, canine, first premolar) after the sockets have healed. Given the contraindications of uncontrolled diabetes for implants and the poor biomechanics of a long-span bridge, the most appropriate treatment is a Removable Partial Denture (RPD). The cells of primary interest concerning the trauma are the **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells**, whose non-viability after 28 hours precludes replantation.

For the denture replacement:
*   **Type of Denture:** A Removable Partial Denture (RPD) with a rigid metal framework.
*   **Material:** A **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy framework** with acrylic resin saddles and acrylic teeth.
*   **Abutment Teeth:** The primary abutments would be the teeth adjacent to the space: the **left central incisor (#10/21) and the left second premolar (#13/25)**.
*   **Reasoning for Abutments:** To ensure stability and prevent functional stress on the abutments, the design must incorporate **cross-arch stabilization**. Therefore, teeth on the opposite side, such as the **right first molar (#3/16) and a right premolar (#4/15 or #5/14)**, would also be engaged. This distributes forces across the arch, providing crucial support and retention, which is essential for a comfortable and long-lasting prosthesis, especially when considering her Class III skeletal pattern (SNB 88‚Å∞) which requires a carefully planned occlusion.
