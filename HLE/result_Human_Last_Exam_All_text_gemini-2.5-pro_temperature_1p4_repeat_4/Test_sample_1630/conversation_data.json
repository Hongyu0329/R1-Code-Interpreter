    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Setup**\n\n*   We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\n*   The derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$. This means both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions.\n*   We need to find the maximum possible number of fixed points for the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n*   A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$, i.e., $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Properties of f(x) and g(x)**\n\n*   Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   Then $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$.\n*   For $f'(x)$ to be positive for all $x$, two conditions must be met for this quadratic:\n    1.  The parabola must open upwards, so its leading coefficient is positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$.\n    2.  The parabola must lie entirely above the x-axis, which means its discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 < 12a_1a_3 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n*   Similarly, for $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\n**3. Determine the Degree of the Composite Function h(x)**\n\n*   $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Since $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree 3, their composition $h(x)$ will also be a polynomial.\n*   The degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of their degrees.\n*   Degree of $h(x) = (\\text{Degree of } f) \\times (\\text{Degree of } g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The leading term of $g(x)$ is $b_3x^3$. The leading term of $h(x)$ is $a_3(b_3x^3)^3 = a_3b_3^3 x^9$. Since $a_3 > 0$ and $b_3 > 0$, the leading coefficient $a_3b_3^3$ is not zero. So, $h(x)$ is indeed a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n**4. Formulate the Fixed-Point Equation**\n\n*   We are looking for the number of solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, or $h(x) = x$.\n*   This is equivalent to finding the number of roots of the polynomial equation $h(x) - x = 0$.\n*   Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $h(x)-x$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\n*   Therefore, the equation $h(x) - x = 0$ can have at most 9 real roots. This means the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**5. Check if 9 Fixed Points is Attainable**\n\n*   To determine if 9 fixed points are actually possible, we use Rolle's Theorem.\n*   Let $k(x) = h(x) - x$. If $k(x) = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots, say $r_1 < r_2 < \\dots < r_9$, then by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $k'(x)$ must have at least one root in each interval $(r_i, r_{i+1})$. This means $k'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n*   The derivative is $k'(x) = h'(x) - 1$. So, the equation $h'(x) - 1 = 0$, or $h'(x) = 1$, must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n\n**6. Analyze the Derivative h'(x)**\n\n*   We use the chain rule to find $h'(x)$: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n*   Let's determine the degree of the polynomial $h'(x)$:\n    *   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   The degree of the composition $f'(g(x))$ is $(\\text{degree of } f') \\times (\\text{degree of } g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   The degree of $h'(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of $f'(g(x))$ and $g'(x)$, which is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   So, $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8.\n\n**7. Re-evaluate the Condition from Rolle's Theorem**\n\n*   The equation $h'(x) = 1$ is an 8th-degree polynomial equation. Such an equation can have at most 8 real roots.\n*   This is consistent with the requirement from Rolle's Theorem that $h'(x)=1$ must have at least 8 roots for there to be 9 fixed points.\n*   Therefore, it is algebraically possible for $h'(x)=1$ to have exactly 8 distinct real roots.\n\n**8. Constructing the Scenario for 9 Fixed Points**\n\n*   For $h(x)-x$ to have 9 roots, we need to show that a valid choice of $f$ and $g$ can be made.\n    1.  First, we need to choose $f$ and $g$ such that $h'(x)=1$ has 8 distinct real roots. This requires the graph of the 8th-degree polynomial $h'(x)$ to \"wiggle\" sufficiently to cross the horizontal line $y=1$ eight times. This is possible if $h'(x)$ has 7 distinct local extrema (4 minima and 3 maxima) whose values are correctly positioned relative to 1. The number of extrema of $h'(x)$ is limited by the number of roots of its derivative, $h''(x)$. The degree of $h''(x)$ is 7, so it can have up to 7 roots, allowing for 7 local extrema in $h'(x)$. The given constraints on $f$ and $g$ are not so restrictive as to prevent this from being possible with a careful choice of coefficients.\n    2.  Let the 8 roots of $h'(x)=1$ be $c_1 < c_2 < \\dots < c_8$. These are the critical points of $k(x)=h(x)-x$. The function $k(x)$ will have 8 local extrema at these points.\n    3.  The graph of $k(x)$ will alternate between increasing and decreasing in the intervals defined by the $c_i$. Since the leading coefficient of $k(x)$ is positive, $k(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and $k(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n    4.  To get 9 roots for $k(x)=0$, we need the local maxima to be positive and the local minima to be negative. For example: $k(c_1)>0$, $k(c_2)<0$, $k(c_3)>0$, and so on. This will guarantee a root in each of the 9 intervals: $(-\\infty, c_1), (c_1, c_2), \\dots, (c_7, c_8), (c_8, \\infty)$.\n    5.  We can adjust the vertical position of the graph of $k(x)$ by changing the constant term $a_0$ in $f(x)$. This shifts the graph of $h(x)$, and thus $k(x)$, up or down without changing the derivative $h'(x)$ or its roots $c_i$. Therefore, we can always adjust $a_0$ to position the graph of $k(x)$ so that all its local extrema have the desired signs, thus ensuring 9 distinct real roots.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe degree of the composite polynomial $f(g(x))$ is 9. The equation for fixed points $f(g(x))=x$ is a polynomial equation of degree 9, which can have at most 9 real roots. The analysis shows that there are no further constraints that would prevent 9 roots from being attainable. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
