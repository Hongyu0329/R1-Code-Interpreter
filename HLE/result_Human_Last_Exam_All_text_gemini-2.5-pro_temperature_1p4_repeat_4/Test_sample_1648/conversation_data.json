    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object of Study**\nWe need to analyze the algebraic K-groups $K_{2n}(R)$ for the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27$. This ring is of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ with the prime $p=3$ and the exponent $k=3$. The K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ are known to be finite abelian groups for any index $i > 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the K-group into Primary Components**\nA finite abelian group is nonzero if and only if at least one of its $l$-primary components (for some prime $l$) is nonzero. We can therefore analyze the structure of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ by considering its $l$-primary components for all primes $l$. We will split the analysis into two cases: the $3$-primary component ($l=3$) and the prime-to-$3$ components ($l \\neq 3$).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Prime-to-3 Components ($l \\neq 3$)**\nFor a prime $l \\neq p$, the $l$-primary part of the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ can be determined using a standard result in K-theory known as Gabber-Suslin rigidity or dévissage for nilpotent ideals.\nConsider the ideal $I = (3)$ in the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27$. This ideal is nilpotent since $I^3 = (27) = (0)$. The quotient ring is $R/I = (\\mathbb{Z}/27)/(3\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{F}_3$.\nThe rigidity theorem states that for a nilpotent ideal $I$ in a ring $R$, the map $K_*(R) \\to K_*(R/I)$ induces an isomorphism on the $l$-primary components for any prime $l$ that is invertible in $R$. In our case, any prime $l \\neq 3$ is invertible in $\\mathbb{Z}/27$.\nTherefore, for any $l \\neq 3$:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(l)} \\cong K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3)_{(l)}$.\n\nThe algebraic K-groups of finite fields were computed by Quillen. A key result is that for any finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and any integer $n \\ge 1$, the even K-groups vanish:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_q) = 0$.\nApplying this to our case with $q=3$:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\nThis implies that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{F}_3)_{(l)} = 0$ for any prime $l$.\nConsequently, for any $l \\neq 3$:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(l)} = 0$.\nThis means that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ must be a $3$-group (i.e., its order is a power of 3).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the 3-Primary Component**\nTo determine the $3$-primary part of $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$, we rely on the deep results connecting algebraic K-theory to Topological Cyclic Homology (TC), primarily developed by Bökstedt, Hesselholt, and Madsen. The cyclotomic trace map induces an isomorphism on the $p$-primary parts:\n$K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)_{(p)} \\cong \\pi_i(TC(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; p))$.\n\nThe homotopy groups of the $p$-adic topological cyclic homology spectrum $TC(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; p)$ have been computed. For an odd prime $p$ (which includes $p=3$) and any integer $n \\ge 1$:\n$\\pi_{2n}(TC(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k; p)) = 0$.\n(In contrast, these groups can be non-zero for $p=2$, leading to a different structure for the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/2^k$.)\n\nApplying this result to our situation with $p=3, k=3$:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)_{(3)} \\cong \\pi_{2n}(TC(\\mathbb{Z}/27; 3)) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Results**\nFrom Step 3, we concluded that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is a $3$-group. From Step 4, we concluded that its $3$-primary component is zero. A group that is a $p$-group and has a trivial $p$-primary component must be the trivial group.\nTherefore, for all natural numbers $n \\ge 1$:\n$K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = 0$.\n\n**Step 6: Interpret the Question and Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero. Our analysis shows that for any $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$, the group is zero. This means the set of natural numbers satisfying the condition is empty. A question about the \"largest element\" of an empty set is ill-posed.\n\nHowever, in some mathematical contexts, the term \"natural numbers\" includes 0 ($\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$). Let's consider this possibility.\nIf $n=0$, we are looking at the group $K_{2 \\cdot 0}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_0(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$.\nThe zeroth K-group of a commutative ring $R$ classifies finitely generated projective modules over $R$. For the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, which is a local ring, all finitely generated projective modules are free. The group is therefore isomorphic to the group of ranks, which is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n$K_0(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe group $\\mathbb{Z}$ is nonzero. So, if $n=0$ is considered a natural number, then $n=0$ is a number for which the group is nonzero.\n\nGiven that our analysis for $n \\ge 1$ shows the group is always zero, the set of non-negative integers $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero is just $\\{0\\}$. The largest element in this set is 0. This provides a consistent numerical answer to the question.\n\nFinal conclusion based on this interpretation: The largest such \"natural number\" $n$ is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
