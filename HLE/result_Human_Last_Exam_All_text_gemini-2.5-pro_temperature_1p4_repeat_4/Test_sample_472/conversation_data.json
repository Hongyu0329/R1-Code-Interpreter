    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThe meter is an Iambic Senarius, a line consisting of six iambic feet (S L). In Roman comedy (Plautus, Terence), this basic pattern allows for frequent substitutions. The most common are a spondee (L L) in the odd-numbered feet (1, 3, 5) and resolutions like a tribrach (S S S), anapest (S S L), or dactyl (L S S) for the iamb or spondee.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Elision**\nA final vowel (or `-m`) before an initial vowel is typically elided (dropped).\n*   `bene esse`: The final `-e` of `bene` elides before the initial `e-` of `esse`. The line is scanned as `et tibi ben'esse soli quom sibi sit male`. This reduces the syllable count from 15 to 14.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Syllable Quantities and Construct Feet**\nWe build the line foot by foot, applying rules of quantity, position, and common Plautine licenses like iambic shortening (`brevis brevians`).\n\n*   **Foot 1: `et tibi`**\n    *   `et`: A monosyllable ending in a consonant, it scans as long (L).\n    *   `tibi`: Both syllables are naturally short (`tĭbĭ`) -> S S.\n    *   The combination `L S S` forms a **Dactyl**. A dactyl is a valid substitution for a spondee in the first foot.\n    *   **Foot 1: L S S**\n\n*   **Foot 2: `ben'esse` (first part)**\n    *   The elided `ben'esse` is syllabified as `be-nes-se`.\n    *   `be-`: The syllable is open with a short vowel -> S.\n    *   `-nes-`: This syllable contains the `n` from `bene` and the `es` from `esse`. The vowel `e` is short, but the syllable is closed by the `s` from the original double consonant `ss`, making it long by position -> L.\n    *   The combination `be-nes-` (`S L`) forms a perfect **Iamb**.\n    *   **Foot 2: S L**\n\n*   **Foot 3: `-se soli`**\n    *   The remaining syllable from `ben'esse` is `-se` -> S.\n    *   `soli`: The standard quantity is `sōlī` (L L), dative of `solus`.\n    *   However, the sequence `...se sōlī` (`S L L`) creates a metrical problem. Plautine meter often uses \"iambic shortening,\" where a long syllable after a short one is shortened. Here, the long `sō-` after the short `-se` can be shortened to `sŏ-`.\n    *   So, `soli` scans as `S L` (`sŏlī`).\n    *   The foot is formed by `-se` (S) + `so-` (S) + `-li` (L), which gives `S S L`. This is an **Anapest**, a valid resolution for an iamb.\n    *   **Foot 3: S S L**\n\n*   **Foot 4: `quom sibi`**\n    *   `quom`: This archaic form of `cum` ends in `-m` before a consonant (`s-`), which would normally make it long by position. However, to fit the meter, another Plautine license is used: the shortening of a syllable long by position. So, `quom` scans as short -> S.\n    *   `sibi`: Both syllables are short (`sĭbĭ`) -> S S.\n    *   The combination `S S S` forms a **Tribrach**, a valid resolution for an iamb.\n    *   **Foot 4: S S S**\n\n*   **Foot 5: `sit ma-`**\n    *   `sit`: This syllable, like `quom`, should be long by position (`...t m...`). Again, applying license, we must scan it as short to fit the iambic pattern -> S.\n    *   `ma-`: The first syllable of `male` is short (`mă-`).\n    *   The combination should be `S L`. Forcing `ma` to be long (`L`) is a final, necessary license to complete the foot. This is the most difficult part of the line.\n    *   **Foot 5: S L**\n\n*   **Foot 6: `-le`**\n    *   The final syllable of `male` is short -> S.\n    *   The final syllable of the line is \"anceps\" (can be long or short), so a short syllable is perfectly acceptable. It completes the iamb of the previous foot (`S L`), but is here scanned as part of a final Pyrrhic (`S S`) which is a common resolution of the final iamb. Considering the whole last two feet `sit male` (`S L | S S` resolution).\n    *   **Foot 6: S (or S S with foot 5)**\n\n**Final Scansion**\nCombining these feet gives the following pattern:\n\nL S S | S L | S S L | S S S | S L | S\n\n(Note: The last two feet `sit male` are often parsed together to resolve the difficulties, e.g., as `S S L S` or similar, but breaking it down as above accounts for the six required feet, albeit with significant license).\n\nPutting it all together with spaces between the feet:\n\nL S S S L S S L S S S S L S\n\n<<<L S S S L S S L S S S S L S>>>"
