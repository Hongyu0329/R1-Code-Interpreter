    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks whether free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light. To answer this, we must understand the physical requirements for SPDC and the specific material properties of boron nanosheets.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\nSPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. In this process, a single high-energy photon (the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear material and is spontaneously converted into a pair of lower-energy photons (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). For this process to occur, two fundamental conservation laws must be met:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The energy of the pump photon must equal the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons ($\\hbar\\omega_p = \\hbar\\omega_s + \\hbar\\omega_i$).\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The momentum of the pump photon must equal the sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons ($\\hbar\\vec{k}_p = \\hbar\\vec{k}_s + \\hbar\\vec{k}_i$). This is also known as the phase-matching condition.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Material Property for SPDC**\nThe interaction responsible for SPDC is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$. The efficiency of SPDC is directly proportional to the square of the effective $\\chi^{(2)}$ coefficient. Therefore, a material must possess a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ to exhibit SPDC.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Material Property ($\\chi^{(2)}$) to Crystal Symmetry**\nThere is a fundamental relationship between a material's crystal structure and its optical properties. Specifically, for a material to have a non-zero bulk second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$), its crystal lattice must **lack a center of inversion**. Materials whose crystal structures are symmetric with respect to inversion (i.e., for every atom at position `(x, y, z)`, there is an identical atom at `(-x, -y, -z)`) are called **centrosymmetric**. In such materials, the bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is necessarily zero due to symmetry constraints.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets**\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are 2D allotropes of boron. Unlike graphene, which has a single stable structure, borophene has many predicted and experimentally realized polymorphs (different atomic arrangements). The most commonly synthesized and studied phases, such as the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ sheets grown on a silver substrate, are the primary candidates for analysis. For a \"free-standing\" sheet, we consider its intrinsic structure.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets**\nThe common polymorphs of borophene, including the experimentally realized $\\beta_{12}$ (space group *Pmmn*) and $\\chi_3$ sheets, as well as the predicted stable $\\alpha$-sheet, are all **centrosymmetric**. Their 2D crystal lattices possess a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the Analysis to Reach a Conclusion**\n1.  SPDC requires a material with a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  The common, stable structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, the bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ of boron nanosheets is zero.\n5.  Consequently, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit SPDC through the primary, dominant mechanism.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bulk vs. Surface/Edge Effects:** The conclusion that $\\chi^{(2)}=0$ applies to the \"bulk\" of the material. In any finite material, inversion symmetry is broken at surfaces and edges. For a 2D material, the entire object can be considered a surface. However, the intrinsic in-plane symmetry of the borophene lattice still dictates the primary response. While extremely weak nonlinear effects might be observable from edges or defects where symmetry is locally broken, this is not the expected, efficient SPDC process implied by the question.\n\n2.  **Higher-Order Processes:** The prohibition applies to the electric-dipole based $\\chi^{(2)}$ process. Weaker nonlinearities arising from electric-quadrupole or magnetic-dipole interactions can exist even in centrosymmetric materials, but they are typically several orders of magnitude less efficient and are not what is generally meant by SPDC.\n\n3.  **Strain and Substrates:** Applying strain can break the inversion symmetry and induce a small $\\chi^{(2)}$. Similarly, interaction with a substrate can break symmetry. However, the question specifies a \"free-standing\" nanosheet, so we must consider its intrinsic properties.\n\n4.  **Polymorphs:** While the common and stable polymorphs are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible for a less stable, non-centrosymmetric polymorph of borophene to exist. However, based on current experimental and theoretical knowledge, the expected forms are centrosymmetric.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the logical path to the answer is as follows:\n- **Premise 1:** Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that requires a material with a non-zero second-order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n- **Premise 2:** Materials with a center of inversion in their crystal structure (centrosymmetric materials) have a $\\chi^{(2)}$ that is identically zero.\n- **Premise 3:** The experimentally realized and most stable predicted forms of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric.\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to have a $\\chi^{(2)}$ of zero and should not exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<No>>>"
