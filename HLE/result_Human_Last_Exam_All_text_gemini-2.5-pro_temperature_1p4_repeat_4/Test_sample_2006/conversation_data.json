    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Decipher the Question:** The title of the haiku is \"The Bays\". When spoken, this sounds identical to \"The Bs\". The prompt states the title is a question. Therefore, the central question is, \"What are 'The Bs'?\" The instruction to alphabetize the final answer indicates that the answer will be a list of words starting with the letter 'B'.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"A divine one yields\" (Line 3)**\n    *   This line suggests a creator or a god-like figure (\"divine one\") who provides or gives (\"yields\") something.\n    *   Considering the theme of a \"tempest\" from the first line, we look for a prominent figure in the history of meteorology or wind measurement.\n    *   This points directly to Sir Francis **Beaufort**, who created the Beaufort wind force scale. His name provides our first 'B' word.\n    *   **Careful Point:** \"Divine one\" is a metaphorical reference to a creator, in this case, the creator of the scale.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 2: \"An August tempest\" (Line 1)**\n    *   This line establishes the context and theme of the riddle: a powerful storm or wind.\n    *   This context validates the conclusion from Step 2 that the riddle is about the Beaufort wind scale.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line's primary purpose is to set the theme, directing the solver towards concepts of wind and weather.\n\n4.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Beaufort Scale itself**\n    *   Now that we've identified the Beaufort scale as the subject, we must examine it for more 'B' words.\n    *   The scale includes five distinct classifications for a light to strong wind, all using the same key term: Light **Breeze**, Gentle **Breeze**, Moderate **Breeze**, Fresh **Breeze**, and Strong **Breeze**.\n    *   The collective term for this group of phenomena is **Breeze**. This gives us our second 'B' word.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Instead of listing all five types of breezes, the single word \"Breeze\" represents the entire category of 'B' words found on the scale.\n\n5.  **Analyze Clue 4: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" (Line 2)**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is numerically 30 (2 x 15 = 30).\n    *   The phrase \"winds of change\" points to a transition point. On the Beaufort scale, the \"Breeze\" category ends at Force 6 (up to 27 knots). The next level, Force 7, begins at 28 knots. A wind of 30 knots falls into Force 7 (a Near Gale).\n    *   Therefore, the number 30 signifies the point of \"change\" where the wind is no longer a breeze, confirming that \"Breeze\" is a key part of the answer.\n    *   Furthermore, this crucial line itself contains a word that starts with 'B': the word **brings**. This self-referential clue is our third 'B' word.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The line serves two purposes: it mathematically confirms the importance of the \"Breeze\" category and it contains the final clue word within its own text.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Order the Final Answer**\n    *   We have identified three 'B' words from the clues in the haiku: **Beaufort**, **Breeze**, and **Brings**.\n    *   The prompt asks for the answer to be in alphabetical order.\n    *   Alphabetizing the three words, we get: Beaufort, Breeze, Brings.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is the list of these three words, alphabetized and separated by commas.\n\n<<<Beaufort, Breeze, Brings>>>"
