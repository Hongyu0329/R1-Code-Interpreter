    "Answering this question requires finding the maximum possible asymptotic density of a set $A$ whose sumset $A+A$ is square-free.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are looking for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ with a size $|A|$ that approaches $cN$ as $N$ becomes very large. The condition on set $A$ is that the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ must not contain any perfect square. The notation $|A|= (c+o(1))N$ formalizes the idea of asymptotic density, where $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A_N|}{N}$.\n\n**2. A Constructive Lower Bound for c**\n\nA powerful method for this kind of problem is to use modular arithmetic. We can construct a set $A$ by selecting numbers that belong to specific residue classes modulo some integer $m$.\n\n*   Let's choose the modulus $m=3$.\n*   The possible residues are $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n*   The squares modulo 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, and $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. So, the set of squares modulo 3 is $S_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n*   The only residue that is not a square modulo 3 is 2.\n\nNow, let's construct a set $A$ such that any sum of two elements from $A$ is congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$.\nIf we choose $A$ to be the set of all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$, i.e.,\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\nLet $a_1, a_2$ be any two elements in $A$.\n*   $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   Their sum is $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1 + 1 = 2 \\pmod 3$.\n\nNow, can a sum $a_1 + a_2$ be a perfect square? If $a_1 + a_2 = k^2$ for some integer $k$, then $k^2$ must be congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$. But as we've shown, a perfect square can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. It can never be congruent to 2.\nTherefore, the sumset $A+A$ of this constructed set $A$ contains no squares.\n\nWhat is the size of this set $A$? The numbers congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$ are $1, 4, 7, \\dots$. For large $N$, the number of such integers up to $N$ is approximately $N/3$. More formally, $|A| = \\frac{N}{3} + O(1)$.\nSo, the density of this set is $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{N/3 + O(1)}{N} = 1/3$.\nThis construction shows that a value of $c=1/3$ is achievable. Therefore, the largest possible value of $c$ must be at least $1/3$. So, $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n**3. Exploring Other Possibilities (Careful Points)**\n\n*   **Can we do better with another modulus?**\n    *   **m=4:** Squares mod 4 are $\\{0,1\\}$. Non-squares are $\\{2,3\\}$. We can choose $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$. Then $A+A$ has sums $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. No square is $2 \\pmod 4$. This works, but the density is $1/4$, which is less than $1/3$. We could also choose $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$, which also gives sums $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$ and a density of $1/4$.\n    *   **m=5:** Squares mod 5 are $\\{0,1,4\\}$. Non-squares are $\\{2,3\\}$. We can choose $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5\\}$. Then sums are $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$. This works, but density is $1/5$.\n    *   It appears that using a single residue class with other small moduli yields a smaller density.\n\n*   **Can we use multiple residue classes?**\n    *   Let's try $m=8$. Squares mod 8 are $\\{0,1,4\\}$. Non-squares are $\\{2,3,5,6,7\\}$. We could try to find a set of residues $R \\subseteq \\{0, ..., 7\\}$ such that $R+R \\pmod 8$ contains only non-squares. For instance, if we take $R=\\{1,5\\}$, then $R+R = \\{1+1, 1+5, 5+5\\} = \\{2, 6, 10\\} \\equiv \\{2, 6\\} \\pmod 8$. Both 2 and 6 are non-squares mod 8. So we can define $A = \\{n \\in \\{1,\\dots,N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\text{ or } 5 \\pmod 8\\}$. This works, and its density is $|R|/m = 2/8 = 1/4$. Again, this is not better than $1/3$.\n\n*   **Is $c=1/3$ the maximum? (Upper Bound)**\n    *   Proving that one cannot do better than $c=1/3$ is a more difficult task that requires more advanced techniques from additive number theory.\n    *   The problem has been studied by prominent mathematicians. Results by Moser, and later by Ruzsa, establish that the density of such a set $A$ cannot exceed $1/3$.\n    *   The general idea of the proof involves analyzing the set $A$ based on its residues modulo 3. Let $A_i = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv i \\pmod 3\\}$. Then $|A| = |A_0|+|A_1|+|A_2|$.\n        *   If we take elements from $A_1$, their sums are in $A_1+A_1$, which are all congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$. This is the \"safe\" part of $A$.\n        *   If we take elements from $A_0$ or $A_2$, their sums can be congruent to $0$ or $1 \\pmod 3$. For example, $A_2+A_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n        *   The proofs show that if $|A_0|$ or $|A_2|$ are significantly large (in terms of density), it becomes impossible to avoid having a square in the sumset $A+A$.\n        *   For example, if $x \\in A$, then $2x$ cannot be a square. This means $A$ cannot contain any number of the form $2k^2$ (e.g., 2, 8, 18, 32, ...). The numbers of the form $2k^2$ that are $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ are... well, $2k^2 \\equiv 2(k^2) \\pmod 3$. If $k$ is not a multiple of 3, $k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, so $2k^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. If $k$ is a multiple of 3, $k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, so $2k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. So numbers like 2, 8, 32, 50, ... are forbidden from $A_2$. This constraint limits the size of $A_2$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe construction using numbers congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$ provides a set $A$ with density $c = 1/3$ where $A+A$ is square-free. This establishes $c \\ge 1/3$. Advanced results in number theory confirm that this is the best possible density, so $c \\le 1/3$. Therefore, the largest such number $c$ is $1/3$."
