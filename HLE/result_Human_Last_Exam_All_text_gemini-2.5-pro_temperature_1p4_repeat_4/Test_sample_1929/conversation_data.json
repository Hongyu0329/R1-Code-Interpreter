    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene)**\n    *   Structure: CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂\n    *   This is a conjugated diene, a molecule with two double bonds separated by one single bond. It provides 4 pi (π) electrons for the reaction.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**\n    *   Structure: CCl₂=CF₂\n    *   This is a substituted alkene. In the context of this reaction, it is referred to as the dienophile (\"diene-loving\"). It provides 2 pi (π) electrons.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a specific type of pericyclic reaction known as a [4+2] cycloaddition because it involves the 4 π electrons of the diene and the 2 π electrons of the dienophile.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Mechanism of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n1.  **Concerted Mechanism:** The reaction happens in a single, concerted step. All bond-making and bond-breaking occur simultaneously.\n2.  **Ring Formation:** A new six-membered ring is formed.\n3.  **Electron Movement:** Three π bonds are broken (two in the diene, one in the dienophile), and two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new π bond are formed.\n4.  **Diene Conformation:** For the reaction to occur, the diene (1,3-butadiene) must adopt the *s-cis* conformation (where both double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond). Butadiene can easily rotate into this conformation.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Product Structure**\n1.  **Align the Reactants:** Imagine the s-cis butadiene approaching the dienophile.\n    ```\n        H₂C=CH\n            |\n        HC=CH₂\n           +\n      Cl₂C=CF₂\n    ```\n2.  **Form the Bonds:**\n    *   A new σ bond forms between carbon-1 of butadiene and a carbon of the dienophile (e.g., the CCl₂ carbon).\n    *   A new σ bond forms between carbon-4 of butadiene and the other carbon of the dienophile (the CF₂ carbon).\n    *   The π bond between carbons 2 and 3 of butadiene moves to form the new double bond in the resulting six-membered ring.\n3.  **Draw the Product Skeleton:** The reaction results in a cyclohexene derivative. The backbone of the ring comes from the four carbons of butadiene and the two carbons of the dienophile.\n    ```\n         CH=CH\n        /     \\\n      CH₂       CH₂\n       \\      /\n        CCl₂---CF₂\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Regiochemistry and Final Naming**\n*   **Regiochemistry:** This refers to the orientation of the addition. The diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical. The dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is unsymmetrical. However, because the diene is symmetrical, there is only one possible product. It doesn't matter which end of the dienophile attaches to which end of the diene; the resulting molecule is identical upon rotation.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature of the Product:**\n    1.  The parent ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so it is a **cyclohexene**.\n    2.  Number the ring carbons. The two carbons of the double bond must be assigned positions 1 and 2.\n    3.  Number the remaining carbons to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers).\n        *   **Path A:** If we number so the CCl₂ group is at position 4 and the CF₂ group is at position 5, the name would involve \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluoro...\".\n        *   **Path B:** If we number so the CF₂ group is at position 4 and the CCl₂ group is at position 5, the name would involve \"5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluoro...\".\n    4.  Apply the alphabetical rule. Since \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically, the carbon with the chlorine atoms should be given the lower number. Therefore, Path A is correct.\n    5.  The final name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize the reaction as a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   Understand that it forms a six-membered ring.\n*   Correctly identify the new positions of the double bond and the substituents.\n*   Consider regiochemistry; in this case, the symmetry of the diene leads to a single product.\n*   Apply IUPAC rules carefully, including the alphabetical rule for numbering when locants are tied.\n\nThe product of the reaction is the molecule named **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
