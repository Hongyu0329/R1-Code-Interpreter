    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker, allowing for the widest opening range because you are guaranteed to act last post-flop.\n*   **Action:** Open to 2.5x. A standard pre-flop raise size from this position.\n*   **Game Format:** 100BB rake-free cash game.\n    *   **100BB effective stacks:** This means post-flop playability is very important.\n    *   **Rake-free:** This is a critical detail. In a standard game, the rake can make marginal opens unprofitable. In a rake-free environment, any hand that is even slightly profitable (+EV) should be opened. This significantly widens the optimal opening range compared to a raked game.\n*   **Hand in Question:** A suited Jack (Jxs). The possible hands are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. (AJs, KJs, QJs are premium hands and obviously opened).\n*   **Objective:** Find the \"worst\" suited jack that you *should* still open. This means we are looking for the hand at the absolute bottom of the Jxs opening rangeâ€”the one with the lowest Expected Value (EV) that is still positive.\n\n**2. Analyze the Suited Jack Hands**\n\nWe need to rank the suited Jacks by strength and playability. The primary factors are high-card strength, flush potential, and straight potential.\n\n*   **High-Card Strength:** Decreases linearly as the kicker gets lower (T > 9 > 8 ... > 2).\n*   **Flush Potential:** Identical for all suited hands. All can make the second-nut flush (if the ace of that suit isn't on board).\n*   **Straight Potential:** This is the key differentiator among the lower-suited Jacks. A hand's value is increased by its ability to connect with other cards to form straights.\n\nLet's examine the bottom-end of the range: J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n\n*   **J5s:** Connects well with cards like 6, 7, 8, 9.\n*   **J4s:** Connects well with cards like 5, 6, 7, 8.\n*   **J3s:** Is awkwardly gapped. It needs cards like 4, 5, 6, 7 to make a straight. It is too high to effectively connect with the lowest cards (A, 2) and too low to connect well with higher cards.\n*   **J2s:** This hand has a unique property. Besides connecting with 3, 4, 5, 6, it also connects with the \"wheel\" cards (Ace, 3, 4, 5). If a flop comes A-3-4, J2s has a gutshot straight draw. If a flop comes 3-4-5, J2s has an open-ended straight draw. This extra bit of connectivity to the lowest end of the board gives it slightly more playability and equity realization than J3s.\n\n**3. The \"Wheel Connectivity\" Factor**\n\nThis non-linear value is a known concept in poker theory. It's the same reason why A5s is considered a stronger opening hand than A6s in many situations. A5s can make both the nut flush and the A-2-3-4-5 straight, whereas A6s is much more limited in its straight-making potential.\n\nApplying this logic to low suited Jacks, J2s gains a small but significant advantage over J3s due to its ability to connect with wheel cards. J3s is considered the most \"disconnected\" of the low suited Jacks.\n\n**4. Conclusion Based on EV**\n\nSince we are in a rake-free game on the button, GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategy dictates opening all hands that generate a profit. Due to the positional advantage, all suited Jacks, from JTs down to J2s, are profitable opens.\n\nThe \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest Expected Value (EV). Because of its poor straight connectivity compared to its neighbors (J4s and J2s), **J3s** has the lowest EV among all the suited Jacks that are considered standard opens. It is the marginal, bottom-of-the-range hand in this category, but it should still be opened in this specific game scenario.\n\n<<<J3s>>>"
