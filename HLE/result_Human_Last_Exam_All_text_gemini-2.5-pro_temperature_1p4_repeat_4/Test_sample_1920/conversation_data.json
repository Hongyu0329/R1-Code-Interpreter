    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Properties of Dirichlet Characters**\n\n*   A **Dirichlet character** $\\chi$ modulo $q$ is a function from integers to complex numbers. The set of characters modulo $q$ forms a group under multiplication, which is isomorphic to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n*   The **order** of a character $\\chi$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\chi^k$ is the principal character $\\chi_0$.\n*   The **conductor** of a character $\\chi$ is the smallest modulus $f$ for which $\\chi$ can be defined. A character modulo $d$ is called **primitive** if its conductor is $d$.\n*   If $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$ is a product of distinct primes, a character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n*   The conductor of $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$ is the product of the conductors of the $\\chi_i$. A character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ is primitive (with conductor $p$) if and only if it is not the principal character. The principal character has conductor 1. Thus, for $\\chi$ to be a primitive character with conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal.\n*   The order of $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$.\n\n**2. Factorize the Conductor `d`**\n\nThe given conductor is $d = 53599$. We need to find its prime factorization.\n*   $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$.\n*   $7657 \\div 13 = 589$.\n*   $589 \\div 19 = 31$.\n*   31 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Since $d$ is a product of distinct odd primes, the analysis simplifies.\n\n**3. Set up the Conditions for the Component Characters**\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a primitive character of conductor $d$ and order 6. We can write $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo $p$.\n\nThe conditions on the component characters $\\chi_p$ are:\n1.  **Primitivity**: For $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, each $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal. This means the order of each $\\chi_p$, let's call it $k_p$, must be greater than 1 ($k_p > 1$).\n2.  **Order**: The order of $\\chi$ must be 6. This means $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$.\n\n**4. Determine the Possible Orders for Component Characters**\n\nFrom the lcm condition, each individual order $k_p$ must be a divisor of 6. The divisors of 6 are {1, 2, 3, 6}.\nCombined with the primitivity condition ($k_p > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nWe need to verify that characters with these orders exist for each prime modulus. The number of characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n*   For $p=7$, $\\phi(7)=6$. Orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 6, so characters of these orders exist.\n*   For $p=13$, $\\phi(13)=12$. Orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 12, so they exist.\n*   For $p=19$, $\\phi(19)=18$. Orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 18, so they exist.\n*   For $p=31$, $\\phi(31)=30$. Orders {2, 3, 6} are all divisors of 30, so they exist.\n\nFor any of our primes $p$, the number of characters of a given order $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is:\n*   Number of order-2 characters: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of order-3 characters: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of order-6 characters: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\n**5. Count the Number of Valid Combinations**\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to choose the four characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6. We will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet's first count the total number of primitive characters whose order divides 6. For this, the order of each component character, $k_p$, must be a divisor of 6. Since the characters must be non-principal, $k_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nFor each prime factor $p$, the number of available choices for $\\chi_p$ is the sum of the number of characters of orders 2, 3, and 6:\nNumber of choices for each $\\chi_p = \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are four prime factors, the total number of combinations of such characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis count of 625 includes all primitive characters whose order divides 6. Now we must subtract those whose order is not 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. The order cannot be 1 due to the primitivity condition. So we subtract the characters of order 2 and 3.\n\n*   **Characters of order 2**: For the lcm of the orders to be 2, all component orders $k_p$ must divide 2. Since $k_p > 1$, this means $k_p=2$ for all four primes.\n    The number of order-2 characters for each prime is $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    Total number of such characters = $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Characters of order 3**: For the lcm of the orders to be 3, all component orders $k_p$ must divide 3. Since $k_p > 1$, this means $k_p=3$ for all four primes.\n    The number of order-3 characters for each prime is $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    Total number of such characters = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe number of characters of order 6 is the total number of characters with order dividing 6, minus those with order 2, and minus those with order 3.\nNumber of order-6 characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6 is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
