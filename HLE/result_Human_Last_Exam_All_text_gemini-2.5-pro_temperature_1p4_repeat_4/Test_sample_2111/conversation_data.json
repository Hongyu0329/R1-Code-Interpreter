    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figures:** The question involves two individuals: Fernand Braudel, the historian who is quoting, and Paul Morand, the author being quoted.\n2.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The question centers on a quote describing a \"particular conceptual entity.\"\n3.  **Identify the Key Metaphor:** This entity is described metaphorically as something that \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\" This suggests a holistic, all-encompassing, and somewhat self-contained system.\n4.  **Identify the Provided Example:** The question states that this entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This clue suggests the entity is a large-scale human collective, for which a nation is a significant, but perhaps not exclusive, example or component.\n5.  **The Goal:** The task is to identify the specific name of this \"conceptual entity.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Attribution:** It's crucial to recognize that the assertion originally comes from Paul Morand, but it is used by Fernand Braudel to support his own historical framework. The answer must be the concept Braudel was discussing when he used the quote.\n*   **Metaphorical Language:** \"Inscribed within a sphere\" is not literal. It implies a complex, interconnected world with its own boundaries, characteristics, and internal logic.\n*   **The \"Nation\" Clue:** The relationship between the \"nation\" and the entity is one of exemplification. This means a nation is a type of symbol *for* or *within* this larger entity. The entity itself is likely a broader concept than just a single nation.\n*   **Braudel's Focus:** Fernand Braudel is famous for his work on large-scale historical structures and *la longue durée* (the long term). His primary units of analysis were not typically individual states or nations, but larger geographical and cultural zones. This context is essential.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Locating the Source:** The first step is to find where Fernand Braudel quoted Paul Morand. This quote appears in Braudel's major work, *A History of Civilizations* (also published as *Grammar of Civilizations*).\n2.  **Examining the Quote:** Braudel writes, \"'A **civilization**,' Paul Morand once wrote, 'is an equation, a symbol, which must be inscribed within a sphere.'\" (Original French: \"*Une civilisation*, c'est une équation, un symbole, qu'il faut inscrire à l'intérieur d'une sphère.\")\n3.  **Identifying the Entity:** The quote explicitly names the conceptual entity. The sentence begins with \"A **civilization**...\"\n4.  **Conclusion:** The conceptual entity that Braudel, quoting Morand, argues should be inscribed within a sphere is **civilization**. This aligns perfectly with Braudel's broader historical project, which analyzed the long-term history of world civilizations as distinct, large-scale systems. A nation, in his view, would be a component part or a powerful symbol within a larger civilizational sphere (e.g., France within European or Western civilization).\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
