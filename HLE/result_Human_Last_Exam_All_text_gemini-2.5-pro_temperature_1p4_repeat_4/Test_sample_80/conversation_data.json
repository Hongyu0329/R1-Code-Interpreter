    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\nThe objective is to place the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares of a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no bishop can attack another. After determining this maximum number, we need to find out how many edge squares remain empty.\n\n*   **Board:** Standard 8x8 chessboard.\n*   **Pieces:** Bishops.\n*   **Placement Rule:** Bishops can only be placed on the edge squares.\n*   **Attack Rule:** No two bishops can share the same diagonal.\n*   **Question:** How many edge squares are left without a bishop?\n\n**Step 2: Count the Total Number of Edge Squares**\nThe edge of the chessboard consists of the first rank, the eighth rank, the 'a' file, and the 'h' file.\n*   Squares in the first rank (a1 to h1): 8\n*   Squares in the eighth rank (a8 to h8): 8\n*   Squares in the 'a' file (excluding the already counted corners a1 and a8): 6\n*   Squares in the 'h' file (excluding the already counted corners h1 and h8): 6\n*   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the Problem by Color**\nA fundamental property of bishops is that they always remain on squares of the same color they start on. A bishop on a white square can only attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack pieces on black squares. This means we can treat the problem for white squares and black squares completely independently.\n*   Of the 28 edge squares, exactly half are white and half are black.\n*   Number of white edge squares = 28 / 2 = 14.\n*   Number of black edge squares = 28 / 2 = 14.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\nWe need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 white edge squares. Let's list these squares and analyze their diagonals to see which ones attack each other.\n*   **The 14 white edge squares are:** a2, a4, a6, a8, b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8, h3, h5, h7.\n*   Let's identify the pairs that attack each other:\n    *   b1 attacks a2 and h7.\n    *   d1 attacks a4 and h5.\n    *   f1 attacks a6 and h3.\n    *   h1 attacks a8.\n    *   g8 attacks a2.\n    *   e8 attacks a4.\n    *   c8 attacks a6.\n*   Based on these attacks, we can determine the maximum number of bishops. If we place a bishop on a square, we cannot place one on any square it attacks. Through systematic placement (or graph theory analysis), we find that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the 14 white edge squares is **7**.\n*   A possible placement for 7 bishops is: {b1, d1, f1, c8, e8, g8, a8}. Another is {a2, a4, a6, h1, h3, h5, h7}. In both cases, the maximum is 7.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\nWe repeat the same process for the 14 black edge squares.\n*   **The 14 black edge squares are:** a1, a3, a5, a7, c1, e1, g1, h2, h4, h6, b8, d8, f8, h8.\n*   Let's identify the pairs that attack each other:\n    *   a1 attacks h8.\n    *   c1 attacks a3 and h6.\n    *   e1 attacks a5 and h4.\n    *   g1 attacks a7 and h2.\n    *   b8 attacks a7.\n    *   d8 attacks a5.\n    *   f8 attacks a3.\n*   Similar to the white squares, the structure of the attacks allows for a maximum of **7** non-attacking bishops on the black edge squares.\n*   A possible placement for 7 bishops is: {a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, f8}.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\nNow we combine the results from the white and black squares to answer the final question.\n*   Maximum bishops on white edge squares = 7.\n*   Maximum bishops on black edge squares = 7.\n*   Total maximum number of bishops on all edge squares = 7 + 7 = 14.\n*   The question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = (Total edge squares) - (Total placed bishops)\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
