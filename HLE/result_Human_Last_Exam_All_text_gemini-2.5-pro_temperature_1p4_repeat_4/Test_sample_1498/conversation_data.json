    "Of course. Let's break down the question to find the precise answer from the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the specific range of verses (*abyat*, plural of *bayt*) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are listed. It requires identifying both the starting verse and the ending verse of this list.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Relevant Section in the Poem**\nThe poem is structured to cover the pillars of faith (*Imaan*). After discussing the attributes of Allah, it moves on to the belief in His Messengers (*Rusul*). The author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, first mentions the four obligatory attributes of prophets (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence). Immediately after this, he introduces the list of prophets whose names we must know.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Verse that Introduces the List**\nBefore listing the names, the author states that knowing the details of 25 of them is binding. In most standard editions of the poem, this is **bayt 28**:\n\n> تَفْصِيْلُهُمْ خَمْسَةٌ وَعِشْرُوْنَ لَزِمْ\n> كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n>\n> *Translation: Their details are twenty-five, it is necessary / For every responsible person, so verify and take this opportunity.*\n\nThis verse *sets up* the list but does not contain any names itself.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Starting Verse of the List**\nThe very next verse begins the enumeration of the prophets' names. This is the true starting point of the list. This is **bayt 29**:\n\n> هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n> صَالِحْ وَ اِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n>\n> *Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with / Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.*\n\nThis verse clearly begins the list of names.\n\n**Step 5: Follow the List to Its Conclusion**\nWe must continue through the subsequent verses to see where the list ends.\n\n*   **Bayt 30:**\n    > لُوْطٌ وَ اِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا\n    > يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَ اَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n    >\n    > *Translation: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, as well as / Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed the path.*\n*   **Bayt 31:**\n    > شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَ مُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ\n    > ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    >\n    > *Translation: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, and al-Yasa' / Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.*\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Ending Verse of the List**\nThe list concludes in the next verse, ending with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is referred to by one of his names/titles, 'Taha', and described as the \"Seal\". This is **bayt 32**:\n\n> اِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n> عِيْسَى وَ طَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n>\n> *Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya / 'Isa and Taha (Prophet Muhammad), the Seal; leave misguidance.*\n\nThe list of names concludes here. The following verse (bayt 33) is a prayer for all of them (\"Upon them be peace and blessings...\"), confirming that the enumeration has finished.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinction between Introduction and List:** A common mistake is to include bayt 28 as the start of the list. However, it only states the *number* of prophets to be listed, acting as an introduction. The actual listing of names begins in bayt 29.\n2.  **Verse Numbering:** While the numbering (29-32) is standard in most printed editions, it's worth noting that some older manuscripts or different publications might have minor variations. However, the content of the verses and their sequence remains the same.\n3.  **Name of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:** The author uses \"Taha\" (طه), one of the names or titles attributed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, and confirms his identity by calling him \"Khatim\" (خَاتِمٌ), the Seal of the Prophets.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe enumeration of the names of the prophets begins in bayt 29 and concludes in bayt 32.\n\n<<<From bayt (verse) 29 to bayt (verse) 32.>>>"
