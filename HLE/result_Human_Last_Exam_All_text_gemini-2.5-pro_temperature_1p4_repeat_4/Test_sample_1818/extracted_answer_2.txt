The optimal Spreading Factor and Transmission Power are dependent on the specific path loss between the device and the gateway, which is not given. The server's optimal strategy is to calculate the required transmit power for each Spreading Factor (SF7 to SF12) to meet the 1% PER requirement in the Rician channel. It must then find the assigned power (the next available 2 dB step) for each SF and calculate the total energy (`Power * Time_on_Air`). The optimal setting is the (SF, Power) pair that results in the minimum calculated energy. In cases where using a lower SF requires a transmit power just above a discrete power step (e.g., needing 12.1 dBm forces the use of 14 dBm), switching to a higher SF can be more energy-efficient if it allows for a power reduction of 4 dB or more.
