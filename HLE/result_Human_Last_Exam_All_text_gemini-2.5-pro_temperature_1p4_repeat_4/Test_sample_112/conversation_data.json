    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside Sir Launfal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific \"Sir Launfal\"**: The question refers to the Middle English romance poem *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. This is the most famous version of the tale in English and is distinct from earlier versions like Marie de France's *Lanval*.\n\n2.  **Locate the manuscript**: The phrase \"preserved alongside\" points to the physical manuscript in which the poem survives. Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal* is preserved in a single, well-known manuscript: **British Library, MS Cotton Caligula A.ii**. This manuscript dates from the mid-15th century.\n\n3.  **Analyze the manuscript's contents**: The Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it contains a collection of different texts bound together. To answer the question, we need to know what other works are included in this collection. The manuscript contains several famous Middle English romances, including *Sir Orfeo*, *Libeaus Desconus*, and *Emare*, in addition to *Sir Launfal*.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"book of manners\"**: The key is to scan the list of the manuscript's contents for a work that can be classified as a \"book of manners\" or a \"courtesy book.\" These were instructional texts on etiquette, social conduct, and household management.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the specific text**: Within the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript, there is indeed a text that fits this description perfectly. It is a poem in three parts that gives detailed instructions on table manners and the duties of various household officers like the usher and the marshal.\n\n6.  **Name the book**: This book of manners is titled **The Boke of Curtasye**, which translates to **The Book of Courtesy**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Specificity of \"Sir Launfal\"**: It is crucial to identify the correct version of the story (Thomas Chestre's) to find the right manuscript.\n*   **Understanding \"Preserved Alongside\"**: This implies a shared physical context, specifically being part of the same manuscript volume.\n*   **Nature of the Manuscript**: Recognizing that Cotton Caligula A.ii is a miscellany is key to understanding why different types of texts (romance, religious verse, and a courtesy book) would appear together.\n*   **Identifying the Genre**: A \"book of manners\" is a specific genre of medieval literature known as a \"courtesy book.\" Knowing this helps identify the correct text from the manuscript's contents.\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively conclude that the poem *Sir Launfal* is preserved in the same manuscript as the courtesy book, *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye (The Book of Courtesy)>>>"
