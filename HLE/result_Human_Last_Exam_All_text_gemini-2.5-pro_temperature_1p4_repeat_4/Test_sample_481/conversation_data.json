    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:** The primary goal is to identify the different *numbers* imprinted on two specific medication capsules:\n    *   Medication 1: Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\n    *   Medication 2: Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Constraints and Careful Points:**\n    *   **Specificity:** The request is for the *Teva brand* specifically. Imprints from other manufacturers (e.g., Sandoz, Dexcel) are not relevant.\n    *   **Focus:** The answer must be about the imprinted *numbers* only.\n    *   **Negative Constraint 1:** Do not mention color differences.\n    *   **Negative Constraint 2:** Do not mention the word \"PLIVA\". This is a common imprint on some medications, so it's important to explicitly exclude it as instructed.\n    *   **Negative Constraint 3:** Do not mention size differences between the capsules.\n\n3.  **Information Gathering for Teva Fluoxetine 10mg:**\n    *   A search of reliable drug identification resources is performed for \"Teva fluoxetine 10 mg capsule imprint\".\n    *   The results consistently show the full imprint for this capsule is \"TEVA 3105\". The numerical part of this imprint is **3105**.\n\n4.  **Information Gathering for Teva Fluoxetine 20mg:**\n    *   A similar search is performed for \"Teva fluoxetine 20 mg capsule imprint\".\n    *   The results consistently show the full imprint for this capsule is \"TEVA 3106\". The numerical part of this imprint is **3106**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Compare the numerical portions of the imprints identified in the previous steps.\n    *   The number for the 10mg capsule is \"3105\".\n    *   The number for the 20mg capsule is \"3106\".\n    *   The final answer must clearly state these two different numbers, respecting all the negative constraints.\n\n***\n\nThe Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number **3105**. The Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number **3106**.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule has the number 3105 and the 20mg capsule has the number 3106.>>>"
