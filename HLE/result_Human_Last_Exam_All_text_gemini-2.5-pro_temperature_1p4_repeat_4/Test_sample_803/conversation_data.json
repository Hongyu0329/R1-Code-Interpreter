    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\nFirst, we need to have a clear understanding of the key terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Product-free set:** A non-empty subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all elements `a, b` in `S` (including the case where `a = b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`. In other words, `S ∩ (S * S) = ∅`.\n*   **Maximal by inclusion product-free set (MIPFS):** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g` in `G \\ S` (any element not in `S`), the set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n*   **Fills G:** A set `S` is said to fill the group `G` if the set of all products of its elements, `S * S = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`, is equal to the entire group `G`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a filled group if **every** maximal by inclusion product-free set (MIPFS) in `G` fills `G`.\n\n**Step 2: List the Careful Points**\n\n1.  The condition for a \"filled group\" is very strong. It's not enough for *some* MIPFS to fill the group; *all* of them must.\n2.  If we can find even one MIPFS `S` in a group `G` such that `S * S ≠ G`, then `G` is not a filled group. A common way to show a group is not filled is to find an MIPFS `S` that is contained within a proper subgroup `H` of `G`. If `S ⊂ H`, then `S * S ⊂ H * H = H`, which means `S * S` cannot be all of `G`.\n3.  The identity element `e` can never be in a non-empty product-free set `S`. If `e ∈ S` and `s ∈ S`, then `es = s`, which is an element of `S`. This violates the product-free condition.\n4.  The problem specifies the group order is `2q^m` where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (m ≥ 1). We are looking for the *nonabelian* groups of this order.\n\n**Step 3: State the Key Classification Theorem**\n\nThis problem relies on a known result in group theory concerning the classification of filled groups. Proving this theorem from scratch is a significant undertaking. The theorem is:\n\n**Theorem (Hegarty, 2008):** A finite group `G` is a filled group if and only if one of the following holds:\n1.  `G` is a group of prime order.\n2.  `G` is a nonabelian group of order `2p` for some odd prime `p`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Theorem to the Problem**\n\nWe are tasked with finding the *nonabelian* filled groups of order `2q^m`. According to the theorem, we can immediately discard the first case, as groups of prime order are cyclic and therefore abelian.\n\nThis leaves us with the second case: the group `G` must be a nonabelian group of order `2p` for some odd prime `p`.\n\nNow we must match the given order `|G| = 2q^m` with the required order `|G| = 2p`.\nBy comparing these, we get:\n`2q^m = 2p`\n`q^m = p`\n\nHere, `q` is an odd prime and `p` must also be an odd prime. For the number `q^m` to be a prime number, the exponent `m` must be equal to 1. If `m > 1`, then `q^m` would have `q` as a factor, and thus would not be prime.\n\nTherefore, the condition simplifies to **`m = 1`**, and the order of the group must be `2q`.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Nonabelian Groups of Order 2q**\n\nNow we need to identify the nonabelian groups of order `2q`, where `q` is an odd prime. We can use Sylow's theorems to classify groups of this order.\n\nLet `|G| = 2q`.\n*   Let `n_q` be the number of Sylow q-subgroups. By Sylow's Third Theorem, `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)` and `n_q` must divide the order of the group divided by `q`, so `n_q | 2`.\n*   The only numbers that are `≡ 1 (mod q)` and divide 2 are `1`. So, `n_q = 1`. This means there is a unique Sylow q-subgroup, which must be normal in `G`. Let's call this subgroup `H`. `H` is of order `q`, so it is cyclic (`H ≅ Z_q`).\n*   Let `n_2` be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. `n_2 ≡ 1 (mod 2)` and `n_2 | q`. Since `q` is an odd prime, the divisors of `q` are 1 and `q`. Both satisfy `≡ 1 (mod 2)`. So, `n_2` can be 1 or `q`.\n\n**Case 1: `n_2 = 1`**\nIf there is a unique Sylow 2-subgroup `K`, it is also normal. Since both Sylow subgroups `H` and `K` are normal and their intersection is the identity, `G` is their direct product: `G ≅ H × K ≅ Z_q × Z_2`. Since `gcd(q, 2) = 1`, this group is cyclic: `G ≅ Z_{2q}`. This is an abelian group.\n\n**Case 2: `n_2 = q`**\nIf there are `q` Sylow 2-subgroups, then the Sylow 2-subgroup `K` is not normal. `G` is a semidirect product `G ≅ H ⋊ K ≅ Z_q ⋊ Z_2`. A non-trivial semidirect product exists if there is a non-trivial homomorphism from `Z_2` to `Aut(Z_q)`.\nThe automorphism group `Aut(Z_q)` is isomorphic to `(Z/qZ)*`, which is cyclic of order `q-1`. Since `q` is an odd prime, `q-1` is even, so `Aut(Z_q)` has a unique element of order 2. This defines a unique (up to isomorphism) nonabelian group of order `2q`.\nThis group is the **Dihedral group** of order `2q`, denoted `D_q` (or sometimes `D_{2q}`), which is the group of symmetries of a regular q-gon.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the steps:\n1.  A nonabelian group of order `2q^m` can only be a filled group if its order matches the form `2p` for an odd prime `p`.\n2.  This requires `q^m` to be a prime, which forces `m = 1`.\n3.  The order of the group must therefore be `2q`.\n4.  The unique nonabelian group of order `2q` (for odd prime `q`) is the Dihedral group `D_q`.\n\nThus, the only nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are the Dihedral groups `D_q`, and this is only possible when `m=1`.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for odd prime q and natural number m are the Dihedral groups D_q, which exist only when m=1."
