    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$. We want to find the cardinality of this set, $|S|$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** The problem states that $f$ is continuous. A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing. The function $e^x$ is strictly increasing, so this case is possible.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. (If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, and applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$). The function $e^x$ is strictly increasing, so this case is also possible.\n\nSo we must analyze two cases: $f$ is strictly increasing, or $f$ is strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 2: The Commutation Property**\n\nAny solution $f$ must commute with the exponential function. This can be shown as follows:\n$f(e^x) = f(f(f(x)))$.\nLet $y=f(x)$. Then $f(f(y)) = e^y$. So, $f(f(f(x))) = e^{f(x)}$.\nTherefore, we have the important property: $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$.\n\nThis means that $f$ and $\\exp$ commute, i.e., $f \\circ \\exp = \\exp \\circ f$.\n\n**Step 3: Case 1: `f` is strictly increasing**\n\n1.  **Bounds on `f(x)`:** Since $f$ is continuous, it cannot have any fixed points (because if $f(x_0) = x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = x_0$, which would mean $e^{x_0}=x_0$, and this equation has no real solutions). Thus, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n    *   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, and since $f$ is increasing, we would have $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This implies $e^x < x$, which is never true.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n    *   Applying $f$ to $f(x)>x$ (and using that $f$ is increasing), we get $f(f(x)) > f(x)$, which means $e^x > f(x)$.\n    *   So, any strictly increasing solution must satisfy $x < f(x) < e^x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Construction using Abel's functional equation:** The commutation property $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ suggests looking for solutions of the form of a fractional iterate of the exponential function. The $t$-th iterate of a function $g$, denoted $g^{\\circ t}$, can be constructed using an Abel function $\\phi$ which satisfies $\\phi(g(x)) = \\phi(x)+1$. For such a $\\phi$, we have $g^{\\circ t}(x) = \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x)+t)$.\n    Our equation is $f(f(x)) = e^x$, which is $f = (\\exp)^{\\circ 1/2}$. So we are looking for functions $f(x) = \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x)+1/2)$, where $\\phi$ is an Abel function for $\\exp$, i.e., $\\phi(e^x) = \\phi(x)+1$.\n\n3.  **Cardinality of increasing solutions:** For a function like $g(x)=e^x$ which is continuous and satisfies $g(x)>x$ for all $x$, there exist continuous, strictly increasing solutions $\\phi$ to the Abel equation $\\phi(e^x) = \\phi(x)+1$.\n    In fact, there is a whole family of such solutions. If $\\phi_0$ is one such solution, then any other continuous increasing solution $\\phi$ can be written as $\\phi(x) = \\phi_0(x) + p(\\phi_0(x))$, where $p: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function with period 1, and with the additional property that the function $t \\mapsto t+p(t)$ is strictly increasing.\n    Each such choice of $\\phi$ gives a candidate solution $f(x) = \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x)+1/2)$. One can verify that this $f$ is continuous, increasing, and satisfies $f(f(x))=e^x$.\n    Different choices of the periodic function $p$ (as long as $p$ does not itself have a period of 1/2) will lead to different functions $f$.\n    The set of continuous functions on a closed interval (which determines the periodic function $p$) has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). The constraints on $p$ still permit a set of choices with cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    Thus, there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ distinct, strictly increasing, continuous solutions to the equation.\n\n**Step 4: Case 2: `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume such a function $f$ exists.\n1.  **Range of `f`:** As $f$ is a continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $I = R(f)$ must be an open interval, say $(a,b)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, we have $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = b$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = a$.\n2.  **Properties from the main equation:** We know that $f(f(x))=e^x > 0$. This implies that for any value $y$ in the range of $f$, we must have $f(y)>0$. So, for any $y \\in I = (a,b)$, $f(y)>0$.\n3.  **Behavior of `f` on its range:** The outer function in $f(f(x))$ is evaluated on the range $I=(a,b)$. We have $f: (a,b) \\to (0, \\infty)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, this implies $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = 0$.\n4.  **Asymptotic behavior and contradiction:** Since $f$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, we can evaluate these limits at the endpoints if they are finite.\n    *   If $a$ were finite, $\\lim_{y\\to a^+} f(y) = f(a)$, which would mean $f(a)=\\infty$. This is impossible. Thus, $a=-\\infty$.\n    *   If $b$ were finite, $\\lim_{y\\to b^-} f(y) = f(b)$, which would mean $f(b)=0$. This is possible.\n    *   So, a decreasing solution must have a finite upper bound $b$ as its limit at $-\\infty$, and its range must be $(-\\infty, b)$. Furthermore, we must have $f(b)=0$.\n5.  Now we have a description of $f$:\n    *   Range is $(-\\infty, b)$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = b$.\n    *   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n    *   $f(b)=0$.\n6.  Let's check this against the original equation. As $x \\to \\infty$, we have $f(x) \\to -\\infty$. Let $y=f(x)$, so $y \\to -\\infty$.\n    $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y)$.\n    From the original equation, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} e^x = \\infty$.\n    So we must conclude that $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y) = \\infty$.\n7.  However, from the properties of $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ (specifically $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = b$, a finite number), we have a direct contradiction. The limit of the function $f$ as its argument approaches $-\\infty$ cannot be both a finite number $b$ and infinity.\n8.  This contradiction proves that our initial assumption was false. There are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The number of strictly increasing solutions is $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   The number of strictly decreasing solutions is 0.\n*   Since any solution must be in one of these two categories, the total number of solutions is the sum, which is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these continuous functions is the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$."
