    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Core Subject:** The Reverse Turn, a common figure in ballroom dancing.\n*   **Core Action:** \"Overturning,\" which means turning more than the standard amount prescribed for the figure.\n*   **The Constraint:** The action must be impossible \"without disregarding the technique.\" This is the crucial part. It doesn't mean physically impossible, but rather that doing so would violate the fundamental principles, character, and technique of the dance itself.\n*   **The Options:** Five standard ballroom dances.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reverse Turn in Each Dance**\n\nLet's examine the nature of turns and the possibility of overturning them in each dance listed. The key is to differentiate between the \"swing\" dances and the \"non-swing\" dance.\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is characterized by continuous rotation. The entire dance consists of Natural (right) and Reverse (left) turns that flow one into another. While there's a standard amount of turn for each step, the overall feeling is one of constant turning. Small adjustments in the amount of turn are common and necessary to navigate the dance floor. It is not fundamentally against the technique to slightly under- or overturn a step to maintain flow.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** This is a \"swing\" dance. The technique is based on CBM (Contrary Body Movement), body sway, and continuous, flowing rotation. The standard Reverse Turn has a defined amount of turn, but there are many recognized variations, including the \"Overturned Reverse Turn,\" which is a standard syllabus figure in itself. Therefore, overturning is not only possible but is an accepted part of the dance's technique.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Like the Waltz, the Foxtrot is a classic \"swing\" dance. It emphasizes long, gliding movements, CBM, and sway. Overturning figures is a common choreographic tool used to create beautiful lines and change alignments. For example, an Overturned Reverse Turn leading into a Weave is a classic, high-level amalgamation. Overturning is a feature of advanced Foxtrot technique, not a violation of it.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** Another \"swing\" dance, though with a much faster tempo and different character. It combines walks, chasses, and turns. Due to its dynamic nature, many variations exist. Figures like the Overturned Reverse Pivot are used in choreography. Overturning is possible and fits within the energetic and varied technique of the dance.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the other four dances.\n    *   **Technique:** Tango has a staccato (sharp, punctuated) action, not a continuous, flowing one. It is a \"non-swing\" dance, meaning there should be no body sway. It is danced with flexed knees and \"no rise and fall.\"\n    *   **Turning Action:** Turns in Tango are not executed with a continuous, swinging rotation initiated by CBM and sway. Instead, turns are sharp, almost angular, and happen between steps. The feet are placed deliberately, and movement is more direct and planar.\n    *   **The Reverse Turn:** The standard Tango Reverse Turn (often a Rock Turn or a Reverse Turn with an Outside Partner finish) has a very specific, clipped action. To \"overturn\" it would require adding continuous rotation and swing, which are the very elements that Tango technique explicitly forbids. Doing so would transform the staccato, planar Tango figure into a flowing, rotational Waltz or Foxtrot figure, completely disregarding the core technique and character of the Tango.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nIn the four swing dances (Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep), the technique of rotation and sway allows for, and in some cases incorporates, the overturning of turns. In the European Tango, the fundamental technique (staccato, no swing, no sway) is diametrically opposed to the continuous rotational action required to overturn a turn. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango reverse turn without fundamentally violating and disregarding its technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
