The final product C is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

Its IUPAC name is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

Regarding its chirality, the molecule is **achiral**. A molecule is chiral if it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is typically due to the presence of a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). In the structure of 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (Br-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-Ph), none of the carbon atoms are bonded to four different groups. Therefore, it has no stereocenters and is an achiral compound. The chirality of the initial starting material was lost during the first reaction step (E2 elimination).
