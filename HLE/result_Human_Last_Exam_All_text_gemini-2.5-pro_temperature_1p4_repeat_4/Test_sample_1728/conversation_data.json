    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of the given graph.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Graph Definition:**\n    The problem defines a graph \\( G \\) as the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum of graphs\" most commonly refers to the **Cartesian product of graphs**, often denoted by the symbol \\( \\square \\).\n    Let \\( C_n \\) be a cycle of length \\( n \\). The graph \\( G \\) is the Cartesian product of three such cycles:\n    \\( G = C_n \\square C_n \\square C_n \\)\n    The vertices of \\( G \\) are triplets \\( (x, y, z) \\), where \\( x, y, z \\) are vertices of \\( C_n \\). Let's label the vertices of \\( C_n \\) as \\( \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\} \\). Two vertices \\( (x_1, y_1, z_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2, z_2) \\) in \\( G \\) are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate, and the values in that coordinate are adjacent in \\( C_n \\). For example, \\( (x_1, y_1, z_1) \\) is adjacent to \\( (x_2, y_2, z_2) \\) if:\n    *   \\( x_1 \\) is adjacent to \\( x_2 \\) in \\( C_n \\), and \\( y_1 = y_2 \\), and \\( z_1 = z_2 \\).\n    *   or \\( y_1 \\) is adjacent to \\( y_2 \\) in \\( C_n \\), and \\( x_1 = x_2 \\), and \\( z_1 = z_2 \\).\n    *   or \\( z_1 \\) is adjacent to \\( z_2 \\) in \\( C_n \\), and \\( x_1 = x_2 \\), and \\( y_1 = y_2 \\).\n\n2.  **Defining the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the **maximal chromatic number** of \\( G \\). The chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G) \\), is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\( G \\) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The term \"maximal\" implies that we need to consider all possible cycle lengths \\( n \\) (where \\( n \\ge 3 \\), as cycles are defined for lengths 3 and greater) and find the maximum possible value for \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\n3.  **Using the Chromatic Number Formula for Cartesian Products:**\n    There is a standard theorem for the chromatic number of a Cartesian product of graphs:\n    \\( \\chi(H_1 \\square H_2) = \\max(\\chi(H_1), \\chi(H_2)) \\)\n    This theorem states that the chromatic number of the product graph is simply the maximum of the chromatic numbers of the factor graphs.\n\n4.  **Applying the Theorem to Graph G:**\n    We can apply this theorem to our graph \\( G = C_n \\square C_n \\square C_n \\). Let's do it in steps:\n    *   First, consider the product of two cycles: \\( C_n \\square C_n \\).\n        \\( \\chi(C_n \\square C_n) = \\max(\\chi(C_n), \\chi(C_n)) = \\chi(C_n) \\)\n    *   Now, consider the full graph \\( G = (C_n \\square C_n) \\square C_n \\).\n        \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi((C_n \\square C_n) \\square C_n) = \\max(\\chi(C_n \\square C_n), \\chi(C_n)) \\)\n        Substituting the result from the previous step:\n        \\( \\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(C_n), \\chi(C_n)) = \\chi(C_n) \\)\n    This means the chromatic number of the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is equal to the chromatic number of a single cycle of length \\( n \\).\n\n5.  **Finding the Maximal Chromatic Number of a Cycle \\( C_n \\):**\n    Now the problem is reduced to finding the maximum possible value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) for any integer \\( n \\ge 3 \\). The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on the parity of its length \\( n \\):\n    *   **Case 1: \\( n \\) is an even number** (\\( n=4, 6, 8, \\dots \\)). A cycle of even length is a bipartite graph. This means its vertices can be colored with only two colors. Therefore, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\) for even \\( n \\).\n    *   **Case 2: \\( n \\) is an odd number** (\\( n=3, 5, 7, \\dots \\)). A cycle of odd length is not bipartite. It requires at least three colors. A 3-coloring is always possible (color \\( n-1 \\) vertices with alternating colors 1 and 2, and use color 3 for the last vertex). Therefore, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\) for odd \\( n \\).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The possible values for \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) \\) are 2 (when \\( n \\) is even) and 3 (when \\( n \\) is odd). The question asks for the **maximal** chromatic number. Comparing the two possible values, the maximum is 3.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is obtained by finding the maximum possible value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\), which is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
