    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons ($N$)\n\nFirst, we need to count the total number of electrons in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n-   Carbon (C) is element 6, so it has 6 electrons.\n-   Silicon (Si) is element 14, so it has 14 electrons.\n-   Hydrogen (H) is element 1, so it has 1 electron. There are 3 hydrogen atoms.\n-   Fluorine (F) is element 9, so it has 9 electrons.\n\nTotal number of electrons, $N = (\\text{electrons from C}) + (\\text{electrons from Si}) + (\\text{electrons from H}) \\times 3 + (\\text{electrons from F})$\n$N = 6 + 14 + (1 \\times 3) + 9 = 32$ electrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, $K$)\n\nThe basis set is 6-31G**, which is also known as 6-31G(d,p). This notation means:\n-   A 6-31G split-valence basis is used for all atoms.\n-   A set of d-type polarization functions is added to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n-   A set of p-type polarization functions is added to hydrogen atoms.\n\nA point of careful consideration is the number of functions in a polarization set. For d-functions, some programs use 5 spherical harmonic functions ($d_{z^2}, d_{x^2-y^2}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$), while others use 6 Cartesian functions ($d_{xx}, d_{yy}, d_{zz}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$). The problem does not specify the convention. The use of 5 spherical d-functions is more common in theoretical contexts and many modern programs, so we will proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet's count the basis functions for each atom type:\n\n-   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    -   The 6-31G part describes the 1s orbital with two basis functions (a contracted set of 3 Gaussians and a single outer Gaussian).\n    -   The 'p' from (d,p) adds one set of p-functions ($p_x, p_y, p_z$), which consists of 3 basis functions.\n    -   Total for one H atom = 2 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 5 basis functions.\n    -   For 3 H atoms: $3 \\times 5 = 15$ basis functions.\n\n-   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row atoms):**\n    -   The 6-31G part describes the core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) orbitals. This results in 9 basis functions per atom (1 for 1s, 4 for inner valence 2sp, 4 for outer valence 2sp).\n    -   The 'd' from (d,p) adds one set of d-functions. Assuming 5 spherical d-functions.\n    -   Total for one C or F atom = 9 + 5 = 14 basis functions.\n    -   For 1 C and 1 F atom: $14 + 14 = 28$ basis functions.\n\n-   **Silicon (Si) (3rd-row atom):**\n    -   The 6-31G part describes the core (1s, 2s, 2p) and valence (3s, 3p) orbitals. This results in 13 basis functions (5 for core 1s2sp, 4 for inner valence 3sp, 4 for outer valence 3sp).\n    -   The 'd' from (d,p) adds one set of 5 spherical d-functions.\n    -   Total for one Si atom = 13 + 5 = 18 basis functions.\n\n-   **Total number of basis functions ($K$):**\n    $K = (\\text{from 3 H}) + (\\text{from C}) + (\\text{from F}) + (\\text{from Si})$\n    $K = 15 + 14 + 14 + 18 = 61$ spatial orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of singlet CSFs\n\nFor a full CI calculation, the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a system with $N$ electrons, $K$ spatial orbitals, and a total spin $S$ is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula. For a singlet state ($S=0$), which is the ground state for $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$, the formula is:\n\n$N_{CSF}(K, N, S=0) = \\frac{1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2} \\binom{K+1}{N/2+1}$\n\nAn equivalent and sometimes more convenient formula for the number of singlet CSFs is:\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2+1} \\binom{K}{N/2-1}$\n\nWe will use the second formula.\nWe have:\n-   $K = 61$\n-   $N = 32$, so $N/2 = 16$\n-   $N/2 + 1 = 17$\n-   $N/2 - 1 = 15$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{61}{16}^2 - \\binom{61}{17} \\binom{61}{15}$\n\nNow, we calculate the values of the binomial coefficients:\n-   $\\binom{61}{16} = \\frac{61!}{16! (61-16)!} = \\frac{61!}{16! 45!} = 833,260,331,310,125$\n-   $\\binom{61}{17} = \\frac{61!}{17! (61-17)!} = \\frac{61!}{17! 44!} = 1,455,587,784,347,250$\n-   $\\binom{61}{15} = \\frac{61!}{15! (61-15)!} = \\frac{61!}{15! 46!} = 459,941,838,274,620$\n\nNow, substitute these numbers back into the equation for $N_{CSF}$:\n-   Term 1: $\\left( \\binom{61}{16} \\right)^2 = (833,260,331,310,125)^2 = 694,322,899,478,440,597,382,812,562,5$\n-   Term 2: $\\binom{61}{17} \\times \\binom{61}{15} = (1,455,587,784,347,250) \\times (459,941,838,274,620) = 669,463,945,928,828,343,750,000,000,0$\n\nFinally, subtract Term 2 from Term 1:\n$N_{CSF} = 694,322,899,478,440,597,382,812,562,5 - 669,463,945,928,828,343,750,000,000,0$\n$N_{CSF} = 24,858,953,549,612,253,632,812,562,5$\n\nThis number can be written in scientific notation as approximately $2.4859 \\times 10^{28}$.\n\n<<<248589535496122536328125625>>>"
