    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`**\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of `f`**: The function $g(x) = \\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, and therefore injective. Let's assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of `f`**: A continuous and injective function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing (a composition of two decreasing functions is increasing).\n    Since $\\exp(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, $f$ can be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. We must analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\n1.  Since $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous bijection, it must be surjective, meaning its range is $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2.  As a strictly decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n3.  Consider the equation $f(x) = x$. If there were a solution $x_0$, then $f(x_0) = x_0$, which would imply $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This leads to $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. However, the equation $\\exp(x) = x$ has no real solutions (the graph of $y = \\exp(x)$ is always above the line $y=x$). Thus, $f(x)$ has no fixed points.\n4.  Since $f(x) - x$ is a continuous function that is never zero, it must be either always positive or always negative.\n5.  Consider the limit: $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) - \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x = -\\infty - \\infty = -\\infty$. Since the limit is negative, $f(x) - x$ must be negative for sufficiently large $x$. Therefore, we must have $f(x) - x < 0$, or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n6.  Since the range of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, there must exist a unique value $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(a) = 0$.\n7.  From the property $f(x) < x$, we can substitute $x=a$, which gives $f(a) < a$, so $0 < a$.\n8.  Now, let's use the original equation.\n    $f(f(a)) = \\exp(a)$.\n    Since $f(a) = 0$, the left side is $f(0)$.\n    So, we have $f(0) = \\exp(a)$.\n9.  Since we found that $a > 0$, it follows that $\\exp(a) > \\exp(0) = 1$. Thus, $f(0) > 1$.\n10. However, from the property $f(x) < x$, we must have $f(0) < 0$.\n11. The conditions $f(0) > 1$ and $f(0) < 0$ are a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, there are no continuous, strictly decreasing functions $f$ that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly increasing**\n\n1.  As in the decreasing case, $f(x)$ has no fixed points. So either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n2.  If we assume $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining these inequalities gives $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would mean $\\exp(x) < x$, which is false for all real $x$.\n3.  Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n4.  Let $S = \\text{Range}(f)$. Since $f$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $S$ must be an open interval, say $(a, b)$, where $a = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ and $b = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$.\n5.  The equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ means that $f$ maps the range of $f$ to the range of $\\exp(x)$. That is, $f(S) = (0, \\infty)$.\n6.  Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $f(S) = f((a,b)) = (\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y))$.\n7.  Comparing this with $f(S) = (0, \\infty)$, we get $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$.\n8.  The condition $\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y) = \\infty$ implies that $b$ cannot be a finite real number (as $f$ is defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$), so $b = \\infty$.\n9.  The condition $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = 0$ with $a = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ implies that $a$ must be a finite real number. If $a = -\\infty$, then $S=\\mathbb{R}$, and $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = 0$. But for an increasing function, $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y)$ must be the infimum of its range, which would be $-\\infty$, leading to the contradiction $-\\infty = 0$.\n10. So, $a$ is a finite real number. Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = f(a)$. Thus, $f(a) = 0$.\n11. From the property $f(x) > x$, we have $f(a) > a$, which implies $0 > a$.\n12. To summarize the properties of an increasing solution $f$:\n    *   $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   There is a unique number $a < 0$ such that $f(a) = 0$.\n    *   The range of $f$ is $(a, \\infty)$.\n    *   $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   From $f(f(a)) = \\exp(a)$ and $f(a)=0$, we get $f(0) = \\exp(a)$.\n\n**Step 4: Constructing the solutions and finding the cardinality**\n\nWe can construct these solutions. The construction process shows that there is a large family of them.\n\n1.  **Choose a parameter `a`**: We can start by choosing any value for $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. This choice will determine the function's behavior as $x \\to -\\infty$ (since $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = a$) and will fix the value $f(0) = \\exp(a)$. Different choices of $a$ will lead to different functions. The set of possible choices for $a$ is $(-\\infty, 0)$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n2.  **Choose a generating function `h`**: For a fixed $a < 0$, we need to define the function $f$. The structure of the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ means that if we define $f$ on a specific interval, its values everywhere else are determined. A convenient interval to start with is $[a, 0]$.\n    *   We know the values at the endpoints: $f(a) = 0$ and $f(0) = \\exp(a)$.\n    *   We can define $f(x)$ for $x \\in [a, 0]$ to be any continuous, strictly increasing function $h(x)$ that connects these points, i.e., $h(a)=0$ and $h(0)=\\exp(a)$.\n    *   There are additional constraints that $h(x)$ must satisfy, namely that the resulting function $f$ must satisfy $f(x)>x$ for all $x$. This can be shown to be possible for a large family of choices for $h$.\n    *   For any two distinct such generating functions $h_1$ and $h_2$ on $[a, 0]$, the resulting functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ will be different.\n\n3.  **Counting the number of choices for `h`**: For a fixed $a$, how many valid generating functions $h: [a, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(a)]$ are there? The set of all continuous, strictly increasing functions between these endpoints is uncountably infinite. We can, for example, choose the value at the midpoint, $h(a/2)$, to be any value in $(0, \\exp(a))$, and then connect the points with piecewise linear functions. This freedom of choice at just one point already gives a continuum of options. The set of all such functions $h$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n4.  **Total Cardinality**: The total set of solutions is the union of the sets of solutions generated for each choice of $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$.\n    *   Number of choices for $a$: $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Number of choices for the generating function $h$ for each $a$: $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Since different choices of $a$ or $h$ lead to different solutions, the total number of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these continuous functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the real numbers (the continuum)."
