    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions and the question.**\n\n*   **Lattice:** A discrete subgroup of `R^n` that spans the space. It can be described by a Gram matrix `G` of inner products of its basis vectors.\n*   **Positive Definite:** The quadratic form associated with the lattice is positive for all non-zero vectors. This means the Gram matrix `G` is positive definite, and the signature of the lattice is `(n, 0)`.\n*   **Even Lattice (or Type II Lattice):** An integral lattice where the squared norm `(v, v)` of every vector `v` in the lattice is an even integer. This implies that the diagonal entries of the Gram matrix `G` are all even.\n*   **Dimension:** The rank of the lattice, given as `n = 17`.\n*   **Determinant:** The determinant of the Gram matrix `G`, given as `d = 2`.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the number of non-isomorphic lattices that satisfy all these properties.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key parameters of the lattice.**\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can extract the following parameters:\n*   Dimension: `n = 17`\n*   Determinant: `d = 2`\n*   Type: Even (Type II)\n*   Signature: Since the lattice is positive definite, `n_+ = 17` and `n_- = 0`. The signature difference is `τ = n_+ - n_- = 17 - 0 = 17`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the existence conditions from the theory of integral lattices.**\n\nThe theory of integral quadratic forms and lattices provides necessary conditions for a lattice with a given set of parameters to exist. These conditions, often called \"genus conditions,\" must be satisfied. If they are not, no such lattice can exist.\n\nA fundamental theorem (found in works like J.H. Conway and N.J.A. Sloane's \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\" or J.-P. Serre's \"A Course in Arithmetic\") relates the signature, dimension, and determinant of an even lattice.\n\n**Step 4: State the relevant theorem.**\n\nFor an even (Type II) lattice, there is a congruence condition that its signature difference `τ` must satisfy. This condition depends on the prime factorization of the determinant `d`.\n\nThe specific condition relevant to our case is for when the determinant `d` can be written as `d = 2 * k`, where `k` is an odd integer. Our determinant is `d = 2`, so `k=1`. The number `k=1` is an odd square (`1=1^2`).\n\nThe theorem states: For an even (Type II) lattice with determinant `d = 2 * s^2` where `s` is an odd integer, the signature difference `τ = n_+ - n_-` must satisfy the congruence:\n`τ ≡ 0, 2,` or `-2 (mod 8)`\n\n**Step 5: Check if the given lattice parameters satisfy the theorem.**\n\n1.  **Calculate the signature difference `τ`:**\n    As determined in Step 2, for a positive definite lattice of dimension 17, `τ = 17`.\n\n2.  **Check the congruence condition:**\n    We need to check the value of `τ` modulo 8.\n    `17 = 2 * 8 + 1`\n    So, `17 ≡ 1 (mod 8)`.\n\n3.  **Compare with the required condition:**\n    The theorem requires `τ` to be congruent to `0`, `2`, or `-2` (which is `6`) modulo 8.\n    Our calculated value is `1 (mod 8)`.\n\n    The set of allowed values is `{0, 2, 6} (mod 8)`.\n    Our value is `1 (mod 8)`.\n    Clearly, `1` is not in the set `{0, 2, 6}`.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n\nThe necessary condition for the existence of a positive definite even lattice of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is not met. The signature `τ = 17` is incompatible with the other properties of the lattice according to the fundamental theorems of the field.\n\nSince no such genus of lattices can exist, it follows that no such lattice can exist.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Positive Definite implies Signature:** It is crucial to correctly deduce that \"positive definite\" for a dimension `n` lattice means the signature is `(n, 0)` and thus the signature difference `τ` is `n`.\n2.  **Even vs. Integral:** The condition \"even\" (Type II) is much stronger than \"integral\" (Type I) and leads to stricter existence conditions. The theorem used applies specifically to even lattices.\n3.  **Correct Theorem Application:** The existence conditions are detailed and depend on the form of the determinant `d`. It's important to identify the correct case (`d = 2 * (odd square)`) and its corresponding congruence rule.\n4.  **Genus vs. Isomorphism Class:** The analysis proves that no *genus* of such lattices exists. Since every lattice belongs to a genus, this is a stronger result that implies no individual (isomorphism class of) lattice can exist.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the parameters given in the question violate the fundamental existence conditions for even lattices. Therefore, no such lattice exists.\n\n<<<0>>>"
