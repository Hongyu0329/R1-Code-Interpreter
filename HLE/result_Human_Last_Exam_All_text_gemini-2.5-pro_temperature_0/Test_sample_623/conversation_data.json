    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Starting Molecule**\nThe starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means that in the six-carbon glucose molecule, the carbon atom at position 1 (the aldehyde carbon) and the carbon atom at position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. The other four carbons are the standard ¹²C.\n\nWe can represent the glucose molecule as:\n**¹³C1** — C2 — C3 — **¹³C4** — C5 — C6\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Metabolic Pathway in Question**\nThe question specifically asks what happens when this molecule \"goes through glycolysis\". Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. The overall reaction for glycolysis is:\nGlucose (6 carbons) → 2 Pyruvate (3 carbons each)\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Labeled Carbons Through Glycolysis**\n*   **Preparatory Phase:** Glucose is phosphorylated and isomerized to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The carbon skeleton remains intact, so the labels are still at positions 1 and 4.\n    **¹³C1** — C2 — C3 — **¹³C4** — C5 — C6 (as Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate)\n\n*   **Cleavage Step:** The enzyme Aldolase cleaves the 6-carbon Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate between C3 and C4 into two 3-carbon molecules:\n    *   Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is formed from carbons 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which is formed from carbons 4, 5, and 6.\n\n*   **Distribution of Labels:**\n    *   The DHAP molecule contains the label from C1 of glucose: **¹³C1** — C2 — C3.\n    *   The G3P molecule contains the label from C4 of glucose: **¹³C4** — C5 — C6.\n\n*   **Isomerization:** DHAP is converted into G3P by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase. So, now we have two molecules of G3P, which will proceed through the rest of glycolysis.\n\n*   **Payoff Phase:** Both G3P molecules are converted into pyruvate. The 3-carbon skeleton is maintained throughout this process. This means that for each 3-carbon G3P molecule that enters the payoff phase, one 3-carbon pyruvate molecule is produced.\n\n*   **Final Labeled Products:** At the end of glycolysis, we have two pyruvate molecules.\n    *   One pyruvate molecule comes from the original G3P (carbons 4, 5, 6 of glucose). The label is on the carbon that was C4 of glucose. This becomes the C1 (carboxyl carbon) of pyruvate.\n    *   The other pyruvate molecule comes from the DHAP (carbons 1, 2, 3 of glucose). The label is on the carbon that was C1 of glucose. This becomes the C3 (methyl carbon) of pyruvate.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Products of Glycolysis**\nThe key part of the question is to determine how many ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules are *released*. We must examine the reactions of the glycolytic pathway itself. The net reaction shows that one 6-carbon glucose molecule is converted into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\nC₆H₁₂O₆ → 2 C₃H₄O₃ (Pyruvate) + other products (ATP, NADH)\n\n**Careful Point:** There are no steps in the glycolytic pathway (from glucose to pyruvate) where a carbon atom is removed and released as carbon dioxide (CO₂). This process is called decarboxylation. Decarboxylation of pyruvate occurs in subsequent pathways, such as the link reaction (pyruvate to acetyl-CoA) or alcoholic fermentation, but not in glycolysis itself.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSince no CO₂ is produced during the process of glycolysis, the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released must be zero. All six carbons from the original glucose molecule, including the two ¹³C labels, are conserved within the two pyruvate molecules that are the final products of the pathway.\n\n<<<0>>>"
