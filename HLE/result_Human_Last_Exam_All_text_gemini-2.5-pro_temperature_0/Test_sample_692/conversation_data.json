    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for four specific things:\n1.  An **\"earliest known date\"**: This implies a specific point in time, not just the earliest evidence of writing or a calendar system in general.\n2.  **\"recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact (like a stone stela, monument, or ceramic).\n3.  **\"pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas\"**: The culture must be native to the Americas and have existed before 1492.\n4.  **\"in the aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written using a native script, such as Maya hieroglyphs or Zapotec glyphs, not a European script.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Potential Candidates and Distinguishing Key Concepts\nSeveral Mesoamerican civilizations developed writing and calendar systems. The main candidates are the Olmec, Zapotec, and Maya. It is crucial to distinguish between the earliest evidence of *writing*, the earliest evidence of a *calendrical glyph*, and the earliest *complete, absolute date*.\n\n*   **Earliest Writing:** The Cascajal Block, attributed to the Olmec civilization around 900 BCE, is often considered the earliest example of writing in the Americas. However, it does not contain any recognizable date.\n*   **Earliest Calendrical Glyph:** Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San Jos√© Mogote, Oaxaca, features a carved glyph of a \"1 Earthquake\" day name. It is dated stylistically to around 600 BCE. This is the earliest known record of a day in the 260-day ritual calendar, but it is not a full date that can be fixed to a specific year in a linear timeline. It is like knowing a day of the week (e.g., \"Tuesday\") without the month or year.\n\n### Step 3: Focusing on Absolute Dates and the Long Count Calendar\nTo record an absolute date that can be precisely located in history, a more sophisticated system is needed. The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar served this purpose. It counts the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date (in 3114 BCE). A full Long Count date allows for a precise correlation with our modern Gregorian calendar. Therefore, the earliest *recorded date* will be the earliest known inscription of a Long Count date.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Earliest Known Long Count Dates\nSeveral artifacts bear very early Long Count dates. These are primarily associated with the Epi-Olmec (or Isthmian) and early Maya cultures.\n\n1.  **La Mojarra Stela 1:** Found in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument is inscribed in the Epi-Olmec script and records two Long Count dates. The earlier of the two is **8.5.3.3.5**, which correlates to **May 143 CE**.\n2.  **The Tuxtla Statuette:** Also an Epi-Olmec artifact, this small greenstone figure has a Long Count date of **8.6.2.4.17**, which correlates to **March 162 CE**.\n3.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** Found at an Olmec-region site in Veracruz, this monument fragment displays a partial Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**. The first digit (the *baktun*) is missing but is reconstructed as '7' based on the style and other factors. This date correlates to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n4.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this stela fragment contains the earliest complete Long Count date found so far. The inscription reads **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n### Step 5: Acquiring the Final Answer\nComparing the dates, the inscription on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is the earliest.\n\n*   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **7.16.3.2.13** = **36 BCE**\n*   Tres Zapotes Stela C: **7.16.6.16.18** = **32 BCE**\n*   La Mojarra Stela 1: **8.5.3.3.5** = **143 CE**\n\nThe date on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo predates the one on Tres Zapotes Stela C by four years. Therefore, the date corresponding to the Long Count **7.16.3.2.13** is the earliest known absolute date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system. This date correlates to a day in **December of 36 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE (Long Count: 7.16.3.2.13)>>>"
