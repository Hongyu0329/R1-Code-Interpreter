    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Context of the Question**\n\n*   **Position: Button (BTN)**. This is the most powerful pre-flop position. We are last to act post-flop, which gives us a significant informational advantage. This allows us to play the widest range of hands profitably.\n*   **Action: Open to 2.5x**. This is a standard opening size.\n*   **Stack Depth: 100BB**. This is a standard cash game stack depth, where implied odds are relevant, but pre-flop hand strength is still very important.\n*   **Game Type: Rake-Free Cash Game**. This is a crucial detail. Rake is the fee taken by the house from each pot. In a normal game, the rake reduces the expected value (EV) of playing marginal hands. In a rake-free environment, the profitability threshold for playing any given hand is lower, meaning we should play even more hands than we would in a raked game.\n*   **Hand Type: \"Suited Jack\"**. This refers to hands like JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s. (Stronger hands like AJs, KJs, QJs are also suited jacks, but they are premium holdings and would never be considered the \"worst\").\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Properties of Suited Jack Hands**\n\nThe value of a suited hand comes from its ability to make strong hands like flushes, pairs, and straights. Let's rank the non-premium suited jacks in descending order of strength:\n\n1.  **JTs**: The strongest. Two high cards, connected for the best straight possibilities.\n2.  **J9s**: Very strong. Still has great straight and flush potential.\n3.  **J8s**: A one-gapper. Still very playable with good straight and flush potential.\n4.  **J7s**: A two-gapper. Playability starts to decrease slightly.\n5.  **J6s**: A three-gapper. Straight potential is diminishing.\n6.  **J5s**: A four-gapper. Can still make a wheel straight (A-2-3-4-5) or a higher straight, but the possibilities are more limited.\n7.  **J4s, J3s, J2s**: These hands have very poor straight connectivity. Their value comes almost exclusively from making a flush, a pair of Jacks (with a very weak kicker), or a low two-pair.\n\nThe general rule is that as the kicker gets lower and the gap between the cards increases, the hand's overall strength and playability decrease. Therefore, **J2s** is objectively the weakest hand in the \"suited jack\" category.\n\n**Step 3: Determine if the Weakest Hand is a Profitable Open**\n\nNow we must determine if J2s, the weakest hand in its class, is still a profitable hand to open-raise from the button under these conditions.\n\n*   **Standard GTO Ranges:** In a standard 100BB *raked* cash game, Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategies recommend opening an extremely wide range from the button, typically 45-50% of all hands. These standard opening ranges almost universally include **all suited jacks**, from JTs down to J2s.\n*   **Impact of \"Rake-Free\":** The absence of rake increases the expected value of every pot we play. A hand that is break-even or slightly unprofitable in a raked game becomes profitable in a rake-free game. Since J2s is already considered a standard open in most raked games, it is *even more* profitable to open in a rake-free environment.\n*   **Conclusion:** All suited jacks, from JTs down to J2s, are profitable opens from the button in a 100BB rake-free game.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"worst suited jack you should open\". Since our analysis shows that you should open *all* of them, the \"worst\" one is simply the weakest hand on that list. As established in Step 2, the weakest suited jack is J2s due to its low kicker and lack of straight potential.\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n\n*   **Positional Advantage:** The button's power is the primary reason such a wide range is profitable.\n*   **Rake-Free Condition:** This is the key factor that pushes even the most marginal hands into clear profitability.\n*   **Hand Strength Hierarchy:** Within the JXs category, strength decreases as the second card's rank decreases. J2s is at the bottom.\n*   **GTO Baseline:** The answer aligns with established GTO poker principles, which advocate for opening all suited jacks from the button even in tougher, raked environments.\n\nTherefore, the worst suited jack that you should still open is the weakest one possible.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
