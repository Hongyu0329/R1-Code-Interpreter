    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:** The question is about a critical exponent, specifically the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, within the framework of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory. The method to be used is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion.\n\n2.  **Define the Epsilon Expansion:** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative technique used in RG. It involves performing calculations in a dimension $d$ that is slightly below the upper critical dimension $d_c$. The expansion parameter is defined as $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. The results for critical exponents are obtained as a power series in $\\epsilon$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For a wide range of systems described by the O(n) vector model (which includes common models of magnetism and fluid transitions), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. Above this dimension, mean-field theory provides the correct critical exponents.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$):** The problem specifies a spatial dimension of $d=3$. Using the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$, we can calculate the value of $\\epsilon$:\n    $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n5.  **Recall the Formula for the Exponent $\\alpha$:** The epsilon expansion provides a formula for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ as a function of $\\epsilon$ and the number of components of the order parameter, 'n'. To the first order in $\\epsilon$, this well-known formula is:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{(4-n)\\epsilon}{2(n+8)} + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n6.  **Determine the Number of Components (n):** The question does not explicitly state the universality class or the value of 'n'. In such cases, it is standard practice to assume the simplest and most common model, which is the **Ising model**. The Ising model describes systems with a scalar order parameter (e.g., up/down spins), and it corresponds to **n=1**.\n\n7.  **Substitute and Calculate:** Now, we substitute the values $\\epsilon=1$ and $n=1$ into the first-order formula for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{(4-1) \\times 1}{2(1+8)}$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2 \\times 9}$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{18}$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Choice of Model (n):** The final value depends on 'n'. We assumed the Ising model (n=1). For other models, the result would differ. For example, for the XY model (n=2), $\\alpha = \\frac{4-2}{2(2+8)} = \\frac{2}{20} = 0.1$. For the Heisenberg model (n=3), $\\alpha = \\frac{4-3}{2(3+8)} = \\frac{1}{22} \\approx 0.045$. The Ising model is the canonical choice when the model is unspecified.\n*   **Nature of the Approximation:** The epsilon expansion is an asymptotic series. Using it for $\\epsilon=1$ is a significant extrapolation from $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Therefore, the result is an approximation. The calculated value of $\\alpha = 1/6 \\approx 0.167$ is reasonably close to, but not the same as, the highly accurate value for the 3D Ising model obtained from numerical simulations and conformal bootstrap methods, which is $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$.\n*   **Higher-Order Corrections:** The calculation was truncated at the first order in $\\epsilon$. Including higher-order terms would modify the result. However, for $\\epsilon=1$, the series does not converge rapidly, and simply including the next term does not necessarily improve the accuracy. The question implicitly asks for the standard first-order result.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat in a d=3 system, calculated using the first-order epsilon expansion for the Ising (n=1) universality class, is $1/6$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
