    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n    *   **Performance:** Jete Woman solo\n    *   **Ballet:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n    *   **Company/Year:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015\n    *   **Action to Count:** Number of \"pas de Balanchines\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Term: \"Pas de Balanchine\"**\n    *   The first critical point is to understand what a \"pas de Balanchine\" is. This is not a formally recognized or codified step in the standard vocabulary of classical ballet (like a *plié* or *jeté*).\n    *   It is a colloquial term used by dancers, often to describe a specific type of traveling step frequently used by the choreographer George Balanchine. This step is a variation of a *pas de basque*, characterized by a sweeping leg motion and a distinctive hip thrust, creating a smooth, gliding quality.\n    *   Because it is not a formal step, its definition can be subjective and vary between schools and dancers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography and Choreographer:**\n    *   The ballet in question, \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated,\" was choreographed by **William Forsythe**, not George Balanchine.\n    *   While Forsythe was heavily influenced by Balanchine and worked to extend his neoclassical principles, he developed his own unique and distinct choreographic language. Forsythe's work is known for deconstructing and pushing the limits of classical ballet technique.\n    *   Forsythe's choreography is not structured around repeating simple, named steps. Instead, it consists of complex, continuous phrases of movement that often defy simple categorization.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The question asks to count a specific step (\"pas de Balanchine\") within a ballet by a different choreographer (William Forsythe).\n    *   The step itself is not a formal, universally defined element.\n    *   Most importantly, the choreographic language of William Forsythe in \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" does not include a repeating, identifiable unit that would be called a \"pas de Balanchine.\" The Jete Woman solo is famous for its extreme extensions, off-balance poses, powerful jetés, and intricate, rapid footwork, but not for the specific traveling step associated with Balanchine.\n    *   Therefore, the premise of the question is flawed. One cannot count a step that is not part of the choreography.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a choreographic element present in William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated.\" Svetlana Gileva, or any dancer performing the Jete Woman solo, would not perform this specific step as it is defined. The number of times she performs it is therefore zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
