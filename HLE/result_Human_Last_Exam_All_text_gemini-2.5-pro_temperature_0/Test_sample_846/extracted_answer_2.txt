To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight. When the sun rises, the UV light should cause the table to change from its stable, elongated **trans** form into its less stable, bent **cis** form. When the sun sets and it gets dark, the table should relax back from the bent **cis** form to the elongated **trans** form.
