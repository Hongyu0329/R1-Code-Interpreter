    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question's Core Requirements:**\nThe question asks for four specific things:\n*   **Two distinct languages.**\n*   **From two different Asian cultures.**\n*   **With no direct historical contact** that would explain the similarities (i.e., the similarities should be coincidental, not due to borrowing or a shared recent linguistic ancestor).\n*   **Nearly identical or highly similar words** for three specific items: \"broom\", \"mom\", and \"dad\".\n\n**2. Initial Brainstorming and Careful Points:**\n\n*   **\"Mom\" and \"Dad\":** The words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are a well-known linguistic phenomenon. Across many unrelated languages, words for \"mother\" often use the /m/ sound (e.g., *mama*, *amma*, *eomma*) and words for \"father\" often use /p/, /b/, or /d/ sounds (e.g., *papa*, *baba*, *dada*, *appa*). This is because these are some of the first and easiest sounds for babies to make. Therefore, finding two unrelated languages with similar words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" is relatively easy. The real challenge is the third word.\n*   **\"Broom\":** Unlike \"mom\" and \"dad\", the word for \"broom\" is a common noun for a household object. It is not a \"nursery word\" and is not subject to the same universal phonetic tendencies. A similarity in the word for \"broom\" between two unrelated languages is much more likely to be a pure coincidence. This makes \"broom\" the key to solving the puzzle.\n*   **\"No Direct Contact\":** This is the most critical constraint. It rules out language pairs like Hindi and Persian (both are related Indo-Iranian languages) or Japanese and Korean (which have a long history of extensive borrowing). The ideal pair would come from different language families and distant geographical regions of Asia.\n\n**3. Strategy: Find the \"Broom\" Coincidence First**\n\nSince finding a match for \"broom\" is the hardest part, it's best to start there. Let's compare the word for \"broom\" in various Asian languages from different families.\n\n*   Hindi: *jhaadoo*\n*   Persian (Farsi): *jâru*\n*   Korean: *bitjaru*\n*   Tagalog: *walis*\n*   Indonesian: *sapu*\n*   Japanese: *hōki*\n*   Mandarin: *sàozhou*\n\nFrom this list, a striking similarity emerges between **Persian** and **Korean**.\n*   Persian: **jâru** (جارو)\n*   Korean: *bit**jaru*** (빗자루)\n\nThe core of the Korean word, *jaru*, is nearly identical to the Persian word *jâru*. This is a remarkable coincidence, as Persian is an Indo-Iranian language spoken in West Asia, while Korean is a Koreanic language from East Asia. They are linguistically unrelated and have no history of direct contact that would lead to borrowing this specific word.\n\n**4. Test the Chosen Pair (Korean and Persian) Against Other Words**\n\nNow that we have a candidate pair with a coincidental match for \"broom\", let's check their words for \"mom\" and \"dad\". We should look at the common, informal terms that children would use.\n\n*   **Language 1: Korean**\n    *   Mom: **Eomma** (엄마)\n    *   Dad: **Appa** (아빠)\n    *   Broom: *Bit**jaru*** (빗자루)\n\n*   **Language 2: Persian (Farsi)**\n    *   Mom: **Mâmân** (مامان) - a common term, similar to \"mommy\"\n    *   Dad: **Bâbâ** (بابا)\n    *   Broom: **Jâru** (جارو)\n\n**5. Final Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nLet's compare the words side-by-side:\n\n*   **Mom:** Korean **Eomma** vs. Persian **Mâmân**. Both are classic \"mama\" words, using the bilabial nasal /m/ sound. They are highly similar in structure and sound.\n*   **Dad:** Korean **Appa** vs. Persian **Bâbâ**. Both are classic \"papa/baba\" words, using repeated bilabial plosive sounds (/p/ and /b/). They are also highly similar.\n*   **Broom:** Korean *bit**jaru*** vs. Persian **Jâru**. The core of the Korean word is almost identical to the Persian word.\n\nThis pair perfectly satisfies all the conditions of the question. The languages are from two very different Asian cultures (Korean in East Asia, Persian in West Asia), they are from unrelated language families, and the words for \"broom\", \"mom\", and \"dad\" are all highly similar due to coincidence.\n\n<<<Korean and Persian (Farsi)>>>"
