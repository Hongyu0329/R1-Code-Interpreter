    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Figures and Concepts:** The question involves three key elements:\n    *   **Fernand Braudel:** A famous French historian known for his work on the *longue durée* (long-term history) and global perspectives.\n    *   **Paul Morand:** A French writer and diplomat whom Braudel quotes.\n    *   **The Metaphor:** The idea of inscribing something \"within a sphere\" to understand it in a broader, global context.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source of the Quote:** The assertion is found in Fernand Braudel's writings, specifically in his book *On History* (*Écrits sur l'histoire*). Braudel was a proponent of a \"total history,\" which examines phenomena not in isolation but within a web of interconnected geographical, social, economic, and cultural factors. He found Morand's metaphor of the sphere to be a perfect illustration of this methodological approach.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Quote:** Braudel, attributing the idea to Paul Morand, writes: **\"A homeland... must be contained within a sphere.\"** The original French term used is *\"une patrie\"*.\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Conceptual Entity\":**\n    *   The direct object of the assertion is \"a homeland\" (*une patrie*). This is the specific entity that Morand, and by extension Braudel, argues must be placed within a larger context (the sphere).\n    *   The question states this entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This fits perfectly. A \"homeland\" or \"fatherland\" (*patrie*) is the territorial and cultural foundation of a \"nation.\" While related, \"homeland\" refers more to the geographical and emotional space, which is a core component of the political and social construct of a \"nation.\"\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:** Fernand Braudel used Paul Morand's idea to argue that even something as seemingly self-contained as a homeland cannot be understood on its own. To truly grasp its history, character, and influence, it must be analyzed within the \"sphere\" of global connections, long-term trends, and wider geographical realities. Therefore, the specific conceptual entity mentioned in the quote is \"a homeland.\"\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the conceptual entity that Braudel, quoting Morand, stated should be inscribed within a sphere is a homeland.\n\n<<<A homeland>>>"
