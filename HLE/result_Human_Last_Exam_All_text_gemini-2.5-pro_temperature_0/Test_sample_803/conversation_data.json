    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset $S \\subseteq G$ is product-free if $S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset$. This means for any $x, y \\in S$ (possibly $x=y$), their product $xy$ is not in $S$.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS):** A product-free set $S$ that is not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group $G$ is filled if every MIPFS $S$ in $G$ generates the whole group, i.e., $\\langle S \\rangle = G$.\n\n### Step 2: Use a Known Characterization of Filled Groups\nA crucial result by G.L. Walls provides a more tractable condition for a group to be filled. For solvable groups, this condition is particularly simple.\n*   **Walls' Condition for Solvable Groups:** A finite solvable group $G$ is filled if and only if $G$ has no normal subgroup $N$ such that the quotient group $G/N$ is a cyclic group of odd order greater than 1.\n\nLet $G$ be a group of order $2q^m$.\n*   By Sylow's theorems, $G$ has a Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ of order $q^m$ and a Sylow 2-subgroup $P$ of order 2.\n*   The number of Sylow $q$-subgroups, $n_q$, must satisfy $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ and $n_q | 2$. Since $q$ is an odd prime, $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ cannot be 2 (as $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ implies $q|1$, impossible). Thus, $n_q=1$.\n*   This means the Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ is unique and therefore normal in $G$.\n*   Since $Q$ is a $q$-group, it is solvable. The quotient group $G/Q$ is isomorphic to $P \\cong C_2$, which is also solvable. Therefore, $G$ is a solvable group.\n*   As $G$ is nonabelian, it must be a semidirect product $G = Q \\rtimes P \\cong Q \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$, where the action $\\alpha: C_2 \\to \\text{Aut}(Q)$ is non-trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Walls' Condition to Groups of Order $2q^m$\nWe need to find all nonabelian groups $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$ of order $2q^m$ that have no cyclic quotients of odd order greater than 1.\n\nLet $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. We analyze the quotient $G/N$.\nFor $G/N$ to have an odd order greater than 1, its order must be $q^k$ for some $1 \\le k \\le m$.\nThis implies that the Sylow 2-subgroup $P$ must be contained in $N$.\nSo, $N$ must be of the form $K \\rtimes P$, where $K = N \\cap Q$.\nFor $N$ to be normal in $G$, $K$ must be a subgroup of $Q$ that is normalized by $G$. Since $Q$ normalizes its own subgroups, we only need $K$ to be normalized by $P$. This means $\\alpha(K)=K$.\nFurthermore, for $N=K \\rtimes P$ to be normal in $G=Q \\rtimes P$, we need the commutator subgroup $[Q, N]$ to be in $N$. This implies $[Q, P] \\le N$. As $[Q,P] \\le Q$, this condition becomes $[Q,P] \\le K$.\n\nSo, a quotient $G/N$ has odd order if and only if $N=K \\rtimes P$ where $K \\le Q$, $\\alpha(K)=K$, and $[Q,P] \\le K$.\nFor such a quotient, $G/N = (Q \\rtimes P) / (K \\rtimes P) \\cong Q/K$.\n\nThe condition for $G$ to be filled is that for any subgroup $K \\le Q$ satisfying:\n1.  $\\alpha(K)=K$\n2.  $[Q,P] \\le K$\nthe quotient group $Q/K$ must not be a non-trivial cyclic group.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Condition based on the Action $\\alpha$\nLet's first assume $Q$ is an abelian group. The action $\\alpha$ is an automorphism of $Q$ of order 2.\nAny finite abelian $q$-group $Q$ (for odd $q$) can be decomposed as a direct sum $Q = Q_I \\oplus Q_S$, where:\n*   $Q_I = \\{x \\in Q \\mid \\alpha(x)=x\\}$ is the subgroup of fixed points.\n*   $Q_S = \\{x \\in Q \\mid \\alpha(x)=x^{-1}\\}$ is the subgroup of inverted points.\n\nThe commutator subgroup is $[Q,P] = \\langle x\\alpha(x)^{-1} \\mid x \\in Q \\rangle$. For abelian $Q$, this is $\\{x\\alpha(x^{-1}) \\mid x \\in Q\\}$.\nAn element $x \\in Q$ can be written as $x=y+z$ with $y \\in Q_I, z \\in Q_S$.\n$x\\alpha(x^{-1}) = (y+z)\\alpha(-(y+z)) = (y+z)\\alpha(-y-z) = (y+z)(-y+z) = 2z$.\nSince $q$ is odd, the map $z \\mapsto 2z$ is an automorphism of $Q_S$. Thus, $[Q,P] = Q_S$.\n\nThe condition for $G$ to be filled becomes: For any subgroup $K \\le Q$ such that $\\alpha(K)=K$ and $Q_S \\le K$, the quotient $Q/K$ must not be a non-trivial cyclic group.\n\nLet's choose the smallest possible such $K$, which is $K=Q_S$.\n*   $\\alpha(Q_S) = Q_S$ is true by definition.\n*   $Q_S \\le Q_S$ is true.\nSo, we must check the quotient $Q/Q_S$.\n$Q/Q_S = (Q_I \\oplus Q_S) / Q_S \\cong Q_I$.\nThus, for $G$ to be filled, the subgroup $Q_I$ must not be a non-trivial cyclic group.\n\nA group is \"non-trivial cyclic\" if it is isomorphic to $C_n$ for $n>1$.\nSo, $Q_I$ cannot be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{q^k}$ for any $k \\ge 1$.\nThis leaves two possibilities for the structure of the abelian $q$-group $Q_I$:\n1.  $Q_I$ is the trivial group, $\\{e\\}$.\n2.  $Q_I$ is a non-cyclic group. This means it is a direct product of at least two cyclic $q$-groups.\n\nThis provides a complete classification for the case where $Q$ is abelian.\n\nCase 1: $Q_I = \\{e\\}$. This means $\\alpha(x)=x^{-1}$ for all $x \\in Q$. The group $G$ is the **generalized dihedral group** $\\text{Dih}(Q)$.\n\nCase 2: $Q_I$ is non-cyclic. For example, $Q_I \\cong C_q \\times C_q$.\n\nIt can be shown that if $Q$ is nonabelian, it is possible to construct a group $G=Q \\rtimes C_2$ that is not filled. For example, if $Q$ has a cyclic abelianization $Q/Q'$, one can often find an action $\\alpha$ such that $[Q,P] \\le Q'$, making $G$ not filled. The simplest and most common class of solutions arises when $Q$ is abelian.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are the semidirect products $Q \\rtimes C_2$, where $Q$ is an abelian group of order $q^m$, and the fixed-point subgroup of the action of $C_2$ on $Q$ is either trivial or non-cyclic.\n\nThe most prominent and simply described family of these groups are the generalized dihedral groups.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number, are the semidirect products $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$, where:\n1.  $Q$ is an abelian group of order $q^m$.\n2.  $C_2$ acts on $Q$ via an automorphism $\\alpha$ of order 2.\n3.  The subgroup of fixed points, $Q_I = \\{x \\in Q \\mid \\alpha(x) = x\\}$, is not a non-trivial cyclic group. This means $Q_I$ is either the trivial group or is a non-cyclic abelian $q$-group.\n\nA major subclass of these groups, corresponding to the case where the fixed-point subgroup $Q_I$ is trivial, are the **generalized dihedral groups**, $\\text{Dih}(Q)$, where $Q$ is any abelian group of order $q^m$. In these groups, the action of the non-identity element of $C_2$ is to invert every element of $Q$."
