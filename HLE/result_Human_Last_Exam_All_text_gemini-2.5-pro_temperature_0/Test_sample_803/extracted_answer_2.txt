The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number, are the semidirect products $G = Q \rtimes C_2$, where:
1.  $Q$ is an abelian group of order $q^m$.
2.  $C_2$ acts on $Q$ via an automorphism $\alpha$ of order 2.
3.  The subgroup of fixed points, $Q_I = \{x \in Q \mid \alpha(x) = x\}$, is not a non-trivial cyclic group. This means $Q_I$ is either the trivial group or is a non-cyclic abelian $q$-group.

A major subclass of these groups, corresponding to the case where the fixed-point subgroup $Q_I$ is trivial, are the **generalized dihedral groups**, $\text{Dih}(Q)$, where $Q$ is any abelian group of order $q^m$. In these groups, the action of the non-identity element of $C_2$ is to invert every element of $Q$.
