    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the vector field and the mapping**\n\nThe vector field $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is defined as:\n$n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nwhere the functions $f$ and $G$ depend on the spatial coordinates $(x,y,z)$:\n$f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$\n$r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2}$\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$\n\nThe vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector, since $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = \\sin^2(G) + \\cos^2(G) = 1$. This means that for every point $(x,y,z)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the vector $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z)$ corresponds to a point on the 2-sphere, $S^2$. Thus, the vector field defines a map from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Check the boundary conditions for the Hopf charge**\n\nThe Hopf charge is a topological invariant for maps from the 3-sphere $S^3$ to the 2-sphere $S^2$. To apply this concept to our map from $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we must check the behavior of the map at infinity. We consider the one-point compactification of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which is topologically equivalent to $S^3$. This requires that the vector field $\\mathbf{n}$ approaches a constant value as the distance from the origin goes to infinity.\n\nAs $(x,y,z) \\to \\infty$, either $x^2+y^2 \\to \\infty$ or $|z| \\to \\infty$. In both cases, $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\nThis leads to:\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) \\to \\pi \\exp(-\\infty) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $G=0$ into the expressions for $\\mathbf{n}$:\n$n_x = \\sin(0) \\cos(f) = 0$\n$n_y = \\sin(0) \\sin(f) = 0$\n$n_z = \\cos(0) = 1$\n\nSo, at infinity, the vector field $\\mathbf{n}$ approaches the constant vector $(0,0,1)$ (the \"north pole\" of $S^2$). This means the map is continuous from $S^3$ to $S^2$, and the Hopf charge is well-defined.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the physical interpretation of the Hopf charge**\n\nThe Hopf charge, $Q_H$, can be interpreted as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere $S^2$. A regular point is one where the Jacobian of the map is non-degenerate.\n\nLet's choose two convenient points on $S^2$:\n1.  The \"south pole\": $\\mathbf{p}_S = (0, 0, -1)$.\n2.  A point on the \"equator\": $\\mathbf{p}_E = (1, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the preimage of the south pole**\n\nThe preimage of $\\mathbf{p}_S$ is the set of points $(x,y,z)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ that map to $(0,0,-1)$.\n$\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) = (0,0,-1)$ requires $n_z = \\cos(G) = -1$.\nThis implies $G = (2k+1)\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\nFrom the definition of $G$, we have $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$.\nSo, $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = (2k+1)\\pi$, which simplifies to $\\exp(-10 r_2) = 2k+1$.\nSince $r_2 \\ge 0$, we have $0 < \\exp(-10 r_2) \\le 1$.\nThis restricts the possible integer values of $k$: $0 < 2k+1 \\le 1$, which implies $-1/2 < k \\le 0$.\nThe only integer solution is $k=0$.\nThis gives $\\exp(-10 r_2) = 1$, which means $-10 r_2 = 0$, so $r_2 = 0$.\nSubstituting the definition of $r_2$:\n$\\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2} = 0$.\nThis equation holds if and only if both terms under the square root are zero:\n1.  $z^2 = 0 \\implies z=0$.\n2.  $(x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 = 0 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 0.5$.\nThis describes a circle in the $xy$-plane ($z=0$) with radius $\\sqrt{0.5}$, centered at the origin. Let's call this circle $C_S$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the preimage of the equatorial point**\n\nThe preimage of $\\mathbf{p}_E$ is the set of points $(x,y,z)$ that map to $(1,0,0)$.\n$\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) = (1,0,0)$ requires:\n1.  $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2 + k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\n2.  $n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f) = 0$. Since $\\cos(G)=0$, $\\sin(G)=\\pm 1 \\ne 0$. Thus, we must have $\\sin(f)=0$. This means $f=m\\pi$ for some integer $m$, which corresponds to the x-axis ($y=0$).\n3.  $n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f) = 1$.\n    - If $f=0$ (positive x-axis, $x>0$), then $\\cos(f)=1$, so we need $\\sin(G)=1$. This means $G = \\pi/2 + 2m\\pi$.\n    - If $f=\\pi$ (negative x-axis, $x<0$), then $\\cos(f)=-1$, so we need $\\sin(G)=-1$. This means $G = 3\\pi/2 + 2m\\pi$.\n\nLet's analyze these cases for $G$:\n- Case $G = \\pi/2 + 2m\\pi$:\n  $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 + 2m\\pi \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 + 2m$.\n  The condition $0 < \\exp(-10 r_2) \\le 1$ gives $0 < 1/2 + 2m \\le 1$, which implies $-1/4 < m \\le 1/4$. The only integer solution is $m=0$.\n  This gives $G=\\pi/2$, which corresponds to $f=0$.\n- Case $G = 3\\pi/2 + 2m\\pi$:\n  $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = 3\\pi/2 + 2m\\pi \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 3/2 + 2m$.\n  The condition $0 < \\exp(-10 r_2) \\le 1$ gives $0 < 3/2 + 2m \\le 1$, which implies $-3/4 < m \\le -1/4$. There is no integer solution for $m$.\n\nSo, the only solution is $G=\\pi/2$ and $f=0$.\n$G=\\pi/2 \\implies \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 \\implies -10 r_2 = \\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2) \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\nThe preimage curve, let's call it $C_E$, is defined by the conditions:\n1.  $r_2^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2 \\implies (x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$.\n2.  $f=0 \\implies y=0$ and $x>0$.\nThis describes a closed loop in the positive half of the $xz$-plane.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the linking number of the two preimages**\n\nThe Hopf charge $Q_H$ is the linking number of the curve $C_S$ and the curve $C_E$.\n-   $C_S$ is the circle $x^2+y^2=0.5$ in the $z=0$ plane.\n-   $C_E$ is the loop $(x^2-0.5)^2+z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$ in the $y=0, x>0$ half-plane.\n\nTo find the linking number, we can count how many times one curve pierces a surface bounded by the other curve. Let's consider the disk $D_S$ bounded by $C_S$. This disk is the set of points $(x,y,0)$ such that $x^2+y^2 \\le 0.5$.\nWe need to find the intersection points of the curve $C_E$ with the plane of this disk, which is the $z=0$ plane.\nFor the curve $C_E$, setting $z=0$ gives:\n$(x^2-0.5)^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$\n$x^2-0.5 = \\pm \\ln(2)/10$\n$x^2 = 0.5 \\pm \\ln(2)/10$.\nSince $C_E$ is in the $x>0$ half-plane, we have two intersection points with the x-axis:\n$x_1 = \\sqrt{0.5 - \\ln(2)/10} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5 - 0.0693} = \\sqrt{0.4307} \\approx 0.656$\n$x_2 = \\sqrt{0.5 + \\ln(2)/10} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5 + 0.0693} = \\sqrt{0.5693} \\approx 0.755$\n\nNow we check if these intersection points are inside the disk $D_S$. The disk has a radius of $\\sqrt{0.5} \\approx 0.707$.\n-   For the point $(x_1, 0, 0)$, we have $x_1 \\approx 0.656 < 0.707$. This point is inside the disk $D_S$.\n-   For the point $(x_2, 0, 0)$, we have $x_2 \\approx 0.755 > 0.707$. This point is outside the disk $D_S$.\n\nThe loop $C_E$ pierces the disk bounded by the circle $C_S$ exactly once. Therefore, the linking number of the two curves is $\\pm 1$. The sign depends on orientation conventions, but the magnitude is 1. The Hopf charge is an integer, and for this standard construction, it is conventionally taken to be positive.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Hopf charge of the given vector field is the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points. Our calculation shows this linking number is 1. This is a classic example of a field configuration with a unit Hopf charge, often called a hopfion.\n\nThe Whitehead formula is an integral expression for the Hopf charge:\n$Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) \\, dV$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$ is the auxiliary field derived from $\\mathbf{n}$. While direct computation with this formula can be complicated due to singularities in the choice of the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$, the result must be consistent with the topological linking number. The geometric method used above is more direct and robust for this specific problem.\n\nFinal Answer: The Hopf charge is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
