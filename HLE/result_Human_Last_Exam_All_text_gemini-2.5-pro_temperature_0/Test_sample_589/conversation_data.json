    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the question.**\nThe query asks for a specific scene in a film with the following key components:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate potential candidate films based on these elements.**\nSeveral films feature teenagers and bicycles, so we must carefully check each element.\n\n*   ***It*** **(2017):** This film is from a major studio (New Line Cinema/Warner Bros.) and features teenagers on bikes. However, the character Beverly Marsh rides a blue/teal bike, not a pink one. While they have a confrontation involving a car (driven by Henry Bowers), the specific action of one of them deliberately pedaling *toward* it does not happen in the way described.\n*   ***Pretty in Pink*** **(1986):** This film is from a major studio (Paramount Pictures) and features a teenager protagonist, Andie Walsh. The color pink is central to the theme, but she famously drives a pink car (a Volkswagen Karmann Ghia), not a pink bike.\n*   ***Now and Then*** **(1995):** This film from New Line Cinema features a group of young girls on bikes. The character Chrissy has a pink bike with a banana seat. However, the characters are 12 years old (pre-teen), and there is no notable scene where one of them pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\n*   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure*** **(1985):** This Warner Bros. film is famous for its bicycle, but the bike is red, and the main character, Pee-wee Herman, is an adult, not a teenager.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the film that most closely matches the specific details.**\nThe film that contains the most specific and unusual of these elements—a teenager and a pink bike in a memorable, high-stakes scene—is the 1984 horror classic **A Nightmare on Elm Street**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the scene in *A Nightmare on Elm Street* against the criteria.**\n1.  **Film Type:** It is a classic Hollywood feature film. (✓)\n2.  **Production:** It was produced by New Line Cinema, which, largely due to the success of this franchise, became a major film studio (and is now part of Warner Bros.). (✓)\n3.  **Character:** The scene involves Tina Gray, a high school teenager. (✓)\n4.  **Object:** In her opening nightmare, while being chased by Freddy Krueger, Tina finds and rides a pink (or pinkish-purple) bicycle in an alley. (✓)\n5.  **Action:** This is the point of discrepancy. Tina does not pedal toward an oncoming car. She pedals frantically *away* from Freddy down a dead-end alley, crashing into a pile of trash cans just before Freddy attacks her.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\nDespite the inaccuracy in the description of the action, *A Nightmare on Elm Street* is the only major Hollywood film that features the unique combination of a teenager riding a pink bike in a famous horror sequence. The question likely contains a common error, where the general sense of \"pedaling toward certain doom\" (the dead-end and Freddy) is misremembered as the more common cinematic trope of \"pedaling toward an oncoming car.\" No other film fits the key visual identifiers as precisely.\n\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street>>>"
