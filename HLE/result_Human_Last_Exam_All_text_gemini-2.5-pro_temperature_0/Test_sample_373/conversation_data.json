    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Barbell Graph Structure**\n\n*   A barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge, known as a bridge or bottleneck edge.\n*   The problem specifies a total of 10 nodes. The most standard and symmetric way to construct a 10-node barbell graph is to use two complete graphs of 5 nodes each.\n*   Let's denote the two cliques as `C_A` and `C_B`, each being a complete graph on 5 nodes (K5).\n*   A single edge, the \"bottleneck edge\", connects one node from `C_A` to one node from `C_B`. Let's call these connected nodes `u` (in `C_A`) and `v` (in `C_B`). The bottleneck edge is `(u, v)`.\n*   The total number of nodes in the graph is N = 10.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Randomized Uniform Gossiping\" Sampling Process**\n\n*   \"Randomized uniform gossiping\" typically refers to a standard node-centric communication protocol. The process of \"sampling an edge\" in one step of this protocol is as follows:\n    1.  A node `i` is selected uniformly at random from the set of all `N` nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N`.\n    2.  The selected node `i` then chooses one of its neighbors, `j`, uniformly at random to communicate with. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor `j` is `1/deg(i)`, where `deg(i)` is the degree (number of neighbors) of node `i`.\n*   The edge `(i, j)` is considered \"sampled\" for this step. The problem asks for the probability that the sampled edge is the bottleneck edge `(u, v)`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Degrees of the Bottleneck Nodes**\n\n*   To find the probability, we need the degrees of the two nodes that form the bottleneck edge: `u` and `v`.\n*   **Degree of node `u`:** Node `u` is in the 5-node clique `C_A`. It is connected to the other 4 nodes within its clique. Additionally, it is connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge. Therefore, `deg(u) = 4 (from C_A) + 1 (to v) = 5`.\n*   **Degree of node `v`:** By symmetry, node `v` is in the 5-node clique `C_B`. It is connected to the other 4 nodes within its clique and also to node `u`. Therefore, `deg(v) = 4 (from C_B) + 1 (to u) = 5`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n\n*   The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n    1.  Node `u` is selected, and it chooses to contact node `v`.\n    2.  Node `v` is selected, and it chooses to contact node `u`.\n*   We calculate the probability of each event and add them together.\n*   **Probability of Event 1 (u contacts v):**\n    *   Probability of selecting node `u` = `P(select u) = 1/N = 1/10`.\n    *   Probability of `u` choosing `v` from its neighbors = `P(u chooses v) = 1/deg(u) = 1/5`.\n    *   `P(Event 1) = P(select u) * P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n*   **Probability of Event 2 (v contacts u):**\n    *   Probability of selecting node `v` = `P(select v) = 1/N = 1/10`.\n    *   Probability of `v` choosing `u` from its neighbors = `P(v chooses u) = 1/deg(v) = 1/5`.\n    *   `P(Event 2) = P(select v) * P(v chooses u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n    *   `P(sample (u,v)) = P(Event 1) + P(Event 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Graph Interpretation:** The primary assumption is that a \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" refers to the symmetric structure of two 5-node cliques. This is the standard definition.\n2.  **Gossiping Model:** The analysis relies on the standard node-centric model of gossiping (select a node, then select a neighbor). An alternative interpretation where edges are sampled directly and uniformly from the set of all edges would yield a different result (1/21), but this is not what \"gossiping\" typically implies.\n3.  **Uniform Weights:** The \"uniform weights\" condition confirms that when a node selects a neighbor, each neighbor has an equal probability of being chosen. This justifies using `1/deg(i)` as the selection probability.\n4.  **Single Step Probability:** The question asks for the probability of sampling the edge, which is interpreted as the probability within a single step or iteration of the gossiping algorithm.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe probability is the sum of the chances of each endpoint of the bottleneck edge initiating the contact:\n`P = (1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\nAs a decimal, this is 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
