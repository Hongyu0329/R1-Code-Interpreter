    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, considering each answer choice.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Movement**\nA *cambré derrière* is a fundamental ballet movement where the upper body bends backward from the waist. The goal is to create an elegant, curved line while maintaining balance and control.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Methods**\n*   **Vaganova Method:** Developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, this method is known for its precision, strength, and emphasis on a stable core. It teaches dancers to move the upper body independently from the lower body, maintaining a \"square\" alignment of the hips and shoulders whenever possible. The focus is on creating clean, unbroken lines originating from a strong center.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** Developed by George Balanchine for his neoclassical style, this method emphasizes speed, musicality, and extreme lines. It often pushes the classical vocabulary to its limits, sometimes \"breaking\" traditional lines to create more dynamic and visually striking shapes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic nuances in the *port de bras* (carriage of the arms) between the two methods, the fundamental path of the arms during a cambré (e.g., moving through first to fifth position) is similar. The difference in arm placement is not the primary or most defining distinction in the cambré itself.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is a critical point of divergence.\n    *   **Vaganova:** The Vaganova technique strictly requires the hips to remain stable and directly over the supporting legs. The dancer must not push the pelvis forward. The bend must originate from the upper and middle back, which requires significant back flexibility and core strength. This maintains a pure, classical line.\n    *   **Balanchine:** To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine style often encourages the dancer to release or push the hips forward. This creates a more angular, \"broken\" line at the hip joint but allows for a much greater range of motion backward. This is a hallmark of the Balanchine aesthetic.\n*   **C. Speed:** The speed of any movement, including a cambré, is determined by the musical accompaniment and the context of the choreography (e.g., adagio vs. allegro). It is not an inherent technical difference between the two methods. A cambré can be performed slowly or quickly in either style.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used, not the cause of the difference. By pushing the hips forward (Balanchine), a dancer can achieve a deeper backbend. By keeping the hips stable (Vaganova), the apparent degree of the bend might be less, as it relies solely on spinal flexibility. Therefore, the placement of the hip (B) is the more fundamental technical cause of this difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head follows the line of the spine to complete the curve. The Vaganova method has very specific rules for the head's inclination and focus. The Balanchine style might use a more dramatic or \"thrown back\" head position. However, the most significant structural difference that changes the entire shape of the body in the cambré is not the head, but the hips.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe most fundamental and defining technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the **placement of the hip**. The Vaganova method insists on stable hips, while the Balanchine method allows the hips to push forward to achieve a deeper bend.\n\n<<<B>>>"
