    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the properties of the polynomials f(x) and g(x).**\n\n*   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3.\n*   Let $f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   Let $g(x) = b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   The derivatives are $f'(x) = 3a_3 x^2 + 2a_2 x + a_1$ and $g'(x) = 3b_3 x^2 + 2b_2 x + b_1$. These are quadratic polynomials.\n*   The condition that $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all real numbers $x$ imposes constraints on their coefficients. For a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, the parabola must open upwards ($A>0$) and not intersect the x-axis (discriminant $B^2-4AC < 0$).\n    *   For $f'(x)$: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$. The discriminant is $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n    *   For $g'(x)$: $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$. The discriminant is $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 - 12b_1b_3 < 0 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n*   A key consequence of the derivatives being always positive is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all $x$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the problem in terms of an equation.**\n\n*   We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n*   A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$, which is $f(g(x)) = x$.\n*   This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the degree of the polynomial P(x).**\n\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial whose degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n*   Degree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$ is also of degree 9, since subtracting $x$ does not change the leading term.\n*   According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze whether 9 fixed points is an achievable maximum.**\n\n*   To determine if 9 fixed points are possible, we need to see if the constraints on $f$ and $g$ prevent the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ from having 9 distinct real roots.\n*   For a polynomial of degree 9 to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative must have 8 distinct real roots (by Rolle's Theorem).\n*   Let's analyze the derivative $P'(x)$:\n    $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = h'(x) - 1$.\n*   The roots of $P'(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $h'(x) = 1$.\n*   Using the chain rule, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n*   Let's determine the degree of $h'(x)$:\n    *   $g(x)$ is degree 3.\n    *   $f'(y)$ is a quadratic (degree 2). So, $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial in $x$ of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a quadratic (degree 2).\n    *   $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   The equation $h'(x) = 1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\n*   This means that $P'(x)$ can have up to 8 real roots. This is the number of local extrema of $P(x)$.\n*   A degree 9 polynomial with 8 local extrema can indeed have 9 distinct real roots, provided that the values of the polynomial at its local extrema alternate in sign.\n\n**Step 5: Verify that the constraints do not prevent the existence of such a case.**\n\n*   The primary constraint is that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$. This implies that their product $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ must also be positive for all $x$.\n*   The equation for the extrema of $P(x)$ is $h'(x) = 1$. Since $h'(x)$ must be positive, this equation is perfectly valid.\n*   We need to confirm that it's possible to choose the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ (all 8 of them, plus constants) to satisfy all conditions simultaneously:\n    1.  $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n    2.  The equation $h'(x) = 1$ has 8 distinct real roots.\n    3.  The values of $P(x) = h(x) - x$ at these 8 roots (the local extrema) alternate in sign.\n*   While constructing an explicit example is very complicated, the existence can be justified. The set of coefficients for $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the positive derivative conditions is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^8$. The condition for $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct roots is also an open condition. The analysis shows that the algebraic structure does not forbid this scenario. There are enough free parameters (the coefficients) to create a function $h'(x)$ that oscillates sufficiently to cross the line $y=1$ eight times, and to position the resulting polynomial $P(x)$ appropriately to have 9 roots.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe degree of the composite function $f(g(x))$ is 9. The number of fixed points is the number of solutions to $f(g(x)) = x$, which is a polynomial equation of degree 9. Thus, there can be at most 9 fixed points. The analysis of the derivative $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ shows that it is a polynomial of degree 8. This allows for the existence of 8 local extrema for $h(x)-x$, which in turn allows for 9 real roots. The conditions on $f$ and $g$ do not preclude this possibility. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
