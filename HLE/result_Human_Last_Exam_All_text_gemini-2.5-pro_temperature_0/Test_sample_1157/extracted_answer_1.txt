**1. Management Procedures:**
*   **Phase 1 (Immediate):** Urgent medical referral for diabetes management (target HbA1c < 7.0%), wound debridement and irrigation of sockets, prescription of systemic antibiotics and analgesics, and tetanus prophylaxis.
*   **Phase 2 (Healing):** Allow 8-12 weeks for tissue healing while the patient works to stabilize her diabetes. An optional temporary "flipper" denture can be provided for aesthetics.
*   **Phase 3 (Definitive):** Fabrication and delivery of a definitive removable partial denture. This includes patient education on hygiene and scheduling regular follow-ups.

**2. Cells of Interest:**
The key cells are those involved in wound healing, which are adversely affected by uncontrolled diabetes:
*   **Immune Cells (Neutrophils, Macrophages):** Impaired function leads to increased risk of infection.
*   **Connective Tissue Cells (Fibroblasts):** Reduced function leads to delayed and poor-quality soft tissue healing.
*   **Bone Cells (Osteoblasts, Osteoclasts):** Disrupted activity leads to impaired bone healing in the sockets.
*   **Endothelial Cells:** Impaired angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) starves the healing site of oxygen and nutrients.

**3. Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Type and Material:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture**. The framework will be made of **Cobalt-Chromium alloy**, with **acrylic (PMMA)** saddles and artificial teeth.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Rationale:**
    *   **Abutments:** Left second premolar and left first molar (primary abutments); left central incisor (secondary abutment).
    *   **Reasoning:** This design provides a robust tripod of support and retention. The posterior teeth (premolar and molar) will bear the primary chewing forces via occlusal rests and provide direct retention via clasps. The
