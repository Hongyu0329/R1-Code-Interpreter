    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the United Kingdom during World War II.\n2.  **Identify the Central Conflict:** UK counterintelligence (specifically MI5) suspected him of being a German spy.\n3.  **Identify the Reason for Suspicion:** The text explicitly states the reason for suspicion was that he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\" This is the key clue.\n4.  **Formulate the Research Question:** What was Andre Vernault's profession that he felt the need to hide, leading MI5 to believe he was a spy?\n5.  **Investigate the Case:** Historical records, particularly declassified MI5 files and books written about them (such as Ben Macintyre's \"Agent Zigzag\"), detail this specific case.\n    *   Andre Vernault arrived in Britain in 1940 after fleeing the German invasion of Belgium.\n    *   Like all refugees, he was interrogated by MI5 at a screening center to check for potential enemy agents.\n    *   During his interrogation, Vernault was evasive and gave contradictory stories about his past and what he did for a living. This evasiveness and lack of a credible cover story made him a prime suspect.\n    *   MI5 interned him as a potential threat. However, continued investigation found no evidence of espionage.\n6.  **Discover the Truth:** Eventually, the truth was uncovered. Vernault was not a spy. He was hiding his profession because he was embarrassed and believed that no one would take him seriously or that it would sound so absurd it would make him seem even more suspicious.\n7.  **State the Profession:** His true profession was a **lion tamer**. He had worked in a circus before the war. He feared that admitting to being a lion tamer would sound like a ridiculous lie to his wartime interrogators, so he tried to invent other, more plausible (but inconsistent) professions, which ultimately backfired and made him a key suspect.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Nature of Counterintelligence:** During wartime, paranoia is high. Any inconsistency, evasiveness, or unusual story can be interpreted as a sign of espionage.\n*   **The Psychology of the Individual:** Vernault's decision was based on his own fear and embarrassment. He likely thought that telling such a strange truth would be more damaging than telling a lie.\n*   **The Irony of the Situation:** The very thing he did to avoid suspicion (hiding his unbelievable profession) was what made him a suspect. The truth was stranger than the fiction he tried to create.\n*   **Verification:** This story is a well-documented case from the MI5 archives, often cited as an example of the strange and complex challenges faced by counterintelligence officers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify Andre Vernault's true profession.\n\n<<<Lion tamer>>>"
