    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b \\sin t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The parameter $b$ is defined piecewise, which means the curve is composed of two different parts.\n\n**Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nIn this interval, $b=1$. The equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\nWe can see that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin.\nLet's trace the path:\n*   At $t=0$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi/2$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\nSo, this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, starting from $(1, 0)$ and ending at $(-1, 0)$.\n\n**Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nIn this interval, $b=5$. The equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5 \\sin t$\nWe can see that $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\nLet's trace the path:\n*   As $t$ approaches $\\pi$ from the right, the point approaches $(\\cos \\pi, 5 \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$. This connects to the end of the first part.\n*   At $t=3\\pi/2$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5 \\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n*   As $t$ approaches $2\\pi$, the point approaches $(\\cos(2\\pi), 5 \\sin(2\\pi)) = (1, 0)$. This connects back to the start of the first part.\nSo, this part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Bounding Box of the Figure**\nTo find the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we first need to find the maximum and minimum values of $x$ and $y$ for the entire curve. This will define the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Range of x:** The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The range of the cosine function is $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Range of y:** We need to consider both parts of the curve.\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value is $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and the minimum is $\\sin(0) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$. So, $y \\in [0, 1]$.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5 \\sin t$. The minimum value is $5 \\sin(3\\pi/2) = 5(-1) = -5$. The maximum value approaches $5 \\sin(\\pi) = 0$. So, $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n    *   Combining both intervals, the overall range for y is $[-5, 1]$.\n    *   $y_{max} = 1$\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$\n    *   The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Smallest Circumscribing Square**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that \"outcircles\" or circumscribes this figure must have a side length that is at least as large as the larger of these two dimensions.\n\n*   Side length of the square, $s = \\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height})$\n*   $s = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest square that can contain the entire figure has a side length of 6.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Square**\nThe area of a square with side length $s$ is given by $A = s^2$.\n\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n1.  The piecewise definition of `b` is crucial. The curve is not a single standard shape but a composite of two different shapes.\n2.  The range of $t$ for each piece determines which part of the circle/ellipse is drawn (e.g., upper half vs. lower half).\n3.  The smallest circumscribing square's side length is determined by the maximum dimension (width or height) of the figure's bounding box.\n4.  The width is determined by the range of $x = \\cos t$, which is always $[-1, 1]$ regardless of `b`.\n5.  The height is determined by the range of $y = b \\sin t$, which is different for the two pieces and must be combined to find the overall vertical extent.\n\n<<<36>>>"
