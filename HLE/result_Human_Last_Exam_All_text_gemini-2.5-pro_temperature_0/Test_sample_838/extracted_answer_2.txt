The final product, C, is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane. This molecule is achiral because it does not contain any stereocenters. The original stereocenter in the starting material was destroyed during the first step, an E2 elimination reaction, which resulted in an achiral alkene intermediate. Subsequent reactions did not introduce any new stereocenters.
