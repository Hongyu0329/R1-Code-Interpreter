    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the deadbeat observer.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]` (n=4 states)\n`B = [0; 1; -1; 1]`\n`C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]` (p=2 outputs)\n\nThe goal is to design an observer of the form:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - Cx_hat(k))`\n\nsuch that the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` becomes zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as a deadbeat observer.\n\nThe error dynamics are given by `e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`. For the error to go to zero as fast as possible, all eigenvalues of the matrix `(A - LC)` must be placed at the origin. The characteristic polynomial of `(A - LC)` must be `z^n = z^4`.\n\n**2. Check Observability and Find the Observability Index (v)**\n\nA deadbeat observer can be designed if and only if the system is observable. The shortest number of steps for the error to vanish is the system's observability index, `v`.\n\nThe observability matrix is `O = [C; CA; CA^2; ...; CA^(n-1)]`. Here n=4.\n`O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`\n\nLet's compute the components:\n*   `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n*   `CA = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n*   `CA^2 = [0 0 1 -2; 0 -1 0 -2]`\n*   `CA^3 = [2 0 -1 1; -1 0 0 0]`\n\nThe full observability matrix `O` is an 8x4 matrix. We check its rank. We can find a 4x4 submatrix with a non-zero determinant. For instance, using rows 1, 2, 4, and 6:\n`M = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0; 0 -1 0 -2]`\n`det(M) = 1`. Since `det(M) != 0`, the rank of `O` is 4. The system is observable.\n\nNow, we find the observability index `v`, which is the smallest integer such that `rank([C; CA; ...; CA^(v-1)]) = n = 4`.\n*   For `v=1`: `rank(C) = 2`.\n*   For `v=2`: `rank([C; CA]) = rank([1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]) = 3`.\n*   For `v=3`: `rank([C; CA; CA^2])`. The matrix `M` we used above to show full rank is constructed from rows taken from `C`, `CA`, and `CA^2`. Therefore, `rank([C; CA; CA^2]) = 4`.\n\nThe observability index is `v = 3`. The error can be made zero in 3 steps. This requires `(A - LC)^3 = 0`.\n\n**3. Observer Gain Design using Duality and Pole Placement**\n\nDesigning `L` directly is difficult. We use the principle of duality. Designing the observer gain `L` for the system `(A, C)` is equivalent to designing a state-feedback controller gain `K` for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)`. The observer gain is then `L = K^T`.\n\nThe dual system is:\n`A_d = A^T = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]`\n`B_d = C^T = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]`\n\nWe need to find a gain `K` (a 2x4 matrix) such that `A_d - B_d K` has all its eigenvalues at 0.\n\nSince the dual system is multi-input (2 inputs), we can use Ackermann's formula by first converting it to a single-input system. We choose an input combination vector `g` such that the pair `(A_d, B_d g)` is controllable. Let's try `g = [0; 1]`.\n\nThe new input matrix for the SISO system is:\n`B_d_new = B_d * g = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1] * [0; 1] = [1; 0; 0; 1]`\n\nWe check the controllability of `(A_d, B_d_new)`. The controllability matrix `C_d_new = [B_d_new, A_d B_d_new, A_d^2 B_d_new, A_d^3 B_d_new]` has a determinant of -11, so it is controllable.\n\n**4. Apply Ackermann's Formula**\n\nFor the SISO system `(A_d, B_d_new)`, the feedback gain `k_new` (a 1x4 row vector) that places all poles at the origin is given by:\n`k_new = [0 0 0 1] * (C_d_new)^-1 * alpha(A_d)`\nwhere `alpha(z) = z^4` is the desired characteristic polynomial, so `alpha(A_d) = A_d^4`.\n\n*   **Calculate `A_d^4`**:\n    `A_d^4 = (A^4)^T = [-5 -4 7 -1; 0 0 0 0; 2 1 -2 -1; -2 -1 -3 -6]`\n\n*   **Calculate `q^T = [0 0 0 1] * (C_d_new)^-1`**:\n    This is the last row of the inverse of `C_d_new`. We can find it by solving `C_d_new^T * q = [0; 0; 0; 1]`. This yields:\n    `q^T = [-1/11, 5/11, -2/11, 1/11]`\n\n*   **Calculate `k_new`**:\n    `k_new = q^T * A_d^4`\n    `k_new = 1/11 * [-1, 5, -2, 1] * [-5 -4 7 -1; 0 0 0 0; 2 1 -2 -1; -2 -1 -3 -6]`\n    `k_new = 1/11 * [-1, 1, -6, -3]`\n\n**5. Compute the Full Gain `K` and the Observer Gain `L`**\n\nThe state-feedback gain `K` for the multi-input dual system is found by:\n`K = g * k_new = [0; 1] * (1/11 * [-1, 1, -6, -3])`\n`K = 1/11 * [0 0 0 0; -1 1 -6 -3]`\n\nFinally, the observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K`:\n`L = K^T = 1/11 * [0 -1; 0 1; 0 -6; 0 -3]`\n\nThis can be written as the matrix:\n`L = [0 -1/11; 0 1/11; 0 -6/11; 0 -3/11]`\n\n<<<[[0, -0.0909090909090909], [0, 0.0909090909090909], [0, -0.5454545454545454], [0, -0.2727272727272727]]>>>"
