    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Connecting Statistical Mechanics and Large Deviation Theory**\n\n*   **Boltzmann's Principle:** In statistical mechanics, the entropy `S` of a macroscopic state is related to the number of microscopic ways `W` (microstates) to realize it: `S = k_B log(W)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant. The probability `P` of observing this macrostate is proportional to `W`, so `P ∝ exp(S/k_B)`. The equilibrium state is the one with the maximum entropy, and thus the most probable state.\n*   **Large Deviation Theory (LDT):** LDT, particularly Sanov's Theorem, states that the probability of an empirical distribution deviating from the true underlying distribution decays exponentially with the number of samples `N`. The probability has the form `P ≈ exp(-N * I)`, where `I` is the \"rate function\" that measures the \"distance\" between the observed and true distributions.\n*   **The Bridge:** Comparing the two forms, we can see that maximizing entropy `S` is equivalent to minimizing a rate function `I` that is proportional to `-S`. The equilibrium state of a physical system is the one that minimizes the large deviation probability away from the average behavior. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem provides the mathematical structure (the Legendre-Fenchel transform) for finding this rate function, which is mathematically analogous to the use of Lagrange multipliers to maximize entropy under constraints (like fixed energy).\n\n**2. Defining the System and its Entropy**\n\n*   **System:** We consider a gas of photons (bosons) in a volume `V` at thermal equilibrium.\n*   **Properties of Photons:**\n    1.  They are indistinguishable particles.\n    2.  Any number of photons can occupy the same quantum state (Bose-Einstein statistics).\n    3.  The total number of photons is not conserved, which implies their chemical potential is zero (`μ = 0`).\n*   **Entropy for Bosons:** The number of ways `W` to distribute `n_i` bosons into `g_i` states at energy level `ε_i` is `W_i = (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! * (g_i - 1)!)`. The total `W` is the product over all energy levels. The entropy `S = k_B log(W)`. Using Stirling's approximation for large `n_i` and `g_i`, the entropy can be written as:\n    `S = k_B * Σ_i g_i [ (1 + <n_i>)log(1 + <n_i>) - <n_i>log(<n_i>) ]`\n    where `<n_i> = n_i/g_i` is the average occupation number for a state in the `i`-th energy level.\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy (Minimizing the Rate Function)**\n\nTo find the equilibrium state, we maximize the entropy `S` subject to the physical constraints of the system.\n\n*   **Constraint:** The only constraint for a photon gas in the canonical ensemble is a fixed total average energy, `<E>`.\n    `<E> = Σ_i n_i ε_i`\n    (Note: There is no constraint on the total particle number `N = Σ_i n_i`).\n*   **Method of Lagrange Multipliers:** We maximize the function `L = S/k_B - β(<E> - Σ_i n_i ε_i)`, where `β` is a Lagrange multiplier. Taking the derivative `∂L/∂n_i = 0` yields the equilibrium condition:\n    `log(1 + g_i/n_i) = β ε_i`\n*   **Bose-Einstein Distribution:** Solving for the average occupation number `<n_i> = n_i/g_i`, we get the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for particles with zero chemical potential:\n    `<n_i> = 1 / (exp(β ε_i) - 1)`\n    The Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified with the inverse temperature, `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy `<E>`**\n\nThe mean energy is found by summing the energy of each state multiplied by its equilibrium occupation number. We convert the sum to an integral by introducing the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D box.\n\n*   **Density of States:** For photons (two polarization states), `g(ε)dε = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ε^2 dε`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Integral for `<E>`:**\n    `<E> = ∫_0^∞ ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) dε = ∫_0^∞ ε * (1 / (exp(ε/(k_B T)) - 1)) * (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ε^2 dε`\n    `<E> = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) ∫_0^∞ ε^3 / (exp(ε/(k_B T)) - 1) dε`\n*   **Evaluation:** This is a standard integral in physics. By substituting `x = ε/(k_B T)`, the integral becomes `(k_B T)^4 ∫ x^3/(e^x - 1) dx`. The value of the definite integral is `π^4 / 15`.\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n    `<E> = (8πV / (h^3 c^3)) * (k_B T)^4 * (π^4 / 15) = (8π^5 V (k_B T)^4) / (15 h^3 c^3)`\n    This is the famous Stefan-Boltzmann Law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy `S`**\n\nWe can find the entropy by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula. However, a more direct method uses a fundamental thermodynamic relation.\n\n*   **Thermodynamic Relation:** For any system, the Gibbs Free Energy is `G = E - TS + PV`. For photons, the chemical potential `μ=0`, and since `G = μN`, we have `G=0`. Therefore, `E - TS + PV = 0`.\n*   **Radiation Pressure:** For a photon gas, the pressure `P` is related to the energy density `u = E/V` by `P = u/3 = E/(3V)`.\n*   **Solving for S:** Substituting the pressure into the relation gives:\n    `E - TS + (E/(3V))V = 0  =>  (4/3)E - TS = 0`\n    This yields a simple relation between entropy and energy for a photon gas:\n    `S = (4/3) * <E>/T`\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy:** Substituting our result for `<E>`:\n    `S = (4 / (3T)) * [ (8π^5 V (k_B T)^4) / (15 h^3 c^3) ]`\n    `S = (32π^5 V k_B^4 T^3) / (45 h^3 c^3)`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta) are functions of the volume `V` and temperature `T` of the system.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n`<E> = (8π^5 V (k_B T)^4) / (15 h^3 c^3)`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n`S = (32π^5 V k_B^4 T^3) / (45 h^3 c^3)`\n\n<<<The equilibrium mean energy is `<E> = (8π^5 V (k_B T)^4) / (15 h^3 c^3)` and the equilibrium entropy is `S = (32π^5 V k_B^4 T^3) / (45 h^3 c^3)`.>>>"
