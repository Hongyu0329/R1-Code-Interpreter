    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem provides a system of linear ordinary differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman forward equations for a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. The variables $P_i(t)$ represent the probability of the system being in state $i$ at time $t$. The constants $\\lambda_{ij}$ are the transition rates from state $i$ to state $j$. We are asked to find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which is the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Steady-State Equations\nThe steady-state probabilities, denoted as $P_i = \\lim_{t \\to +\\infty} P_i(t)$, are constant over time. This implies that their time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. By setting the derivatives in the given system to zero, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n\nThe given system is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nAnd the normalization condition:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\n\nSetting the derivatives to zero, we get the steady-state (or balance) equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\n**Careful Point:** The first four equations are linearly dependent (their sum is zero). Therefore, to solve for the unique probabilities, we must use the normalization equation (5) along with any three of the first four equations.\n\n### Step 3: Substituting the Given Values\nThe given transition rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\nLet's substitute these values into the balance equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n2.  (We can skip this one as it's redundant)\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2} \\implies 0 = 0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n\n### Step 4: Solving the System of Linear Equations\nWe will express $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_2 = P_1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_3 = P_2$. Since $P_2 = P_1$, we have $P_3 = P_1$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The simplification $P_2=P_1$ and $P_3=P_2$ makes the problem much easier. It's important to perform these calculations correctly.\n\nNow, substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1\\right) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Probabilities\nCombine the terms with $P_1$:\n$P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 + 1 + 1 \\right) = 1$\n$P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$\n\nTo solve for $P_1$, we first evaluate the expression in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 = \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} = \\frac{0.707}{0.019}$\n\nSo, the equation for $P_1$ is:\n$P_1 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1 \\implies P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow we find $P_0$ using the relation from Step 4:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Final Answer\nThe question asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$.\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707}$\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we perform the division to get the numerical answer:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to six decimal places, the result is 0.946252.\n\n<<<0.946252>>>"
