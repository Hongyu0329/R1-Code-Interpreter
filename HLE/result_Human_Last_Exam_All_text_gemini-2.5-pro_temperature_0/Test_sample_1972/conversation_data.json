    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct novel.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key clues.**\nThe question provides two distinct but related pieces of information attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A specific quote describing a novel: it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the novel's author: he is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nOur task is to find the single novel and author that fit both of these descriptions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first clue (the quote).**\n*   **The Quote:** \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** This is a very specific and memorable piece of literary criticism. It suggests a work that is both fiercely powerful and intellectually complex in its structure. We need to find where Borges used this exact or a very similar phrase.\n*   **Analysis:** A search for this quote directly links it to Borges's review of the novel **Pedro Páramo** by the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**. Borges wrote a prologue for this novel for his \"Biblioteca Personal\" (Personal Library) collection, in which he praises it highly. This quote is one of his most famous assessments of the book, capturing its blend of raw, violent emotion and its intricate, non-linear, puzzle-like structure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second clue (the author description).**\n*   **The Description:** The author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** This comparison is significant. William Faulkner was known for his complex, stream-of-consciousness narratives, long convoluted sentences, and exploration of themes like memory, decay, and the haunting power of the past in the American South. A \"continuator\" would work with similar themes, while a \"simplifier\" would do so with a more concise, direct, or sparse style.\n*   **Analysis:** This description is also famously applied by Borges (and other critics) to **Juan Rulfo**. Rulfo's work, particularly *Pedro Páramo*, deals with themes very similar to Faulkner's: a town haunted by its dead, the inescapable weight of the past, and fragmented memories. However, Rulfo's prose is the opposite of Faulkner's; it is known for its extreme economy, precision, and starkness. He achieves a similar depth of feeling and complexity of time with far fewer words. Therefore, the label \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" fits Juan Rulfo perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the findings.**\n*   The first clue (the \"tiger\" and \"chess\" quote) points directly to the novel **Pedro Páramo**.\n*   The second clue (the \"continuator of Faulkner\" description) points directly to the author **Juan Rulfo**.\n*   Since Juan Rulfo is the author of *Pedro Páramo*, both clues converge on the same work. Borges's praise was for Rulfo's masterpiece.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges was referring to is *Pedro Páramo* by Juan Rulfo.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
