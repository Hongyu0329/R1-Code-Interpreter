    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we will use the standard canonical construction based on the binary representation of the number.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Convert the number to binary.**\n    First, we express the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in its binary form.\n    $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16}$\n    $= \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$\n    In binary, this corresponds to the sum of negative powers of 2:\n    $= 1 \\cdot 2^{-1} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-2} + 0 \\cdot 2^{-3} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-4}$\n    So, the binary representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ is $0.1101_2$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Hackenbush representation of numbers.**\n    In combinatorial game theory, the value of a Hackenbush position can be represented as a sum of simpler games. For a dyadic rational number written in binary, its game representation is the sum of the games for each of its binary components.\n    For $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$, the corresponding Hackenbush game $G(\\frac{13}{16})$ is the sum of the games for each term:\n    $G(\\frac{13}{16}) = G(\\frac{1}{2}) + G(\\frac{1}{4}) + G(\\frac{1}{16})$\n    The sum of games in Hackenbush is represented by placing the individual game structures side-by-side, each connected to the ground independently.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure and number of pieces for each component game.**\n    The canonical Hackenbush representation for a game with value $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ (for $n \\ge 1$) is a single \"stalk\" or \"flower\". This stalk consists of:\n    *   One **red** edge connected to the ground at the base.\n    *   A chain of **n blue** edges stacked on top of the red edge.\n\n    The total number of pieces for the game $G(\\frac{1}{2^n})$ is therefore $1 (\\text{red}) + n (\\text{blue}) = n+1$ pieces.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of pieces for each term of $\\frac{13}{16}$.**\n    We apply the formula from Step 3 to each component of our number.\n    *   **For $G(\\frac{1}{2}) = G(\\frac{1}{2^1})$:** Here, $n=1$. The number of pieces is $1+1 = 2$. (1 red, 1 blue)\n    *   **For $G(\\frac{1}{4}) = G(\\frac{1}{2^2})$:** Here, $n=2$. The number of pieces is $2+1 = 3$. (1 red, 2 blue)\n    *   **For $G(\\frac{1}{16}) = G(\\frac{1}{2^4})$:** Here, $n=4$. The number of pieces is $4+1 = 5$. (1 red, 4 blue)\n\n5.  **Sum the pieces to find the total.**\n    The total number of pieces needed to represent $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the sum of the pieces for each of the three independent structures.\n    Total pieces = (Pieces for $G(\\frac{1}{2})$) + (Pieces for $G(\\frac{1}{4})$) + (Pieces for $G(\\frac{1}{16})$)\n    Total pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The binary expansion of the number is the key to finding its canonical game representation.\n*   The sum of games in Hackenbush corresponds to placing the game pictures next to each other, so the total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces of the component games.\n*   The structure for $G(\\frac{1}{2^n})$ is a well-defined stalk of $n+1$ pieces (1 red base, $n$ blue on top). This is the standard, or canonical, representation. While other, more piece-efficient representations might exist, the question asks for a way to represent the number, and the canonical form is the standard answer.\n\nFinal calculation: $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$."
