    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question asks about a specific anatomical detail on the skull of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. The feature is the \"lacrimal recess,\" which is a depression on the lacrimal bone (a bone in the skull located in front of the eye socket). The question is how many smaller depressions are *contained within* this main recess.\n\n2.  **Consult Primary Scientific Literature:** To answer such a specific paleontological question, we must refer to the scientific papers that describe the fossil. The primary and most detailed description of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022) is the 2002 paper \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of each bone in the skull. When describing the lacrimal bone, they note that its lateral (outer) surface is dominated by a large, deep, subtriangular depression. This large depression is the lacrimal recess, which is part of the larger antorbital fossa.\n\n4.  **Identify the Specific Number of Depressions within the Recess:** The crucial detail is found in the description of this main lacrimal recess. The authors state that within this large fossa, there are **two** large, subsidiary (or secondary) depressions. These are distinct hollows located inside the main recess.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the authoritative anatomical description of the holotype specimen, the main lacrimal recess itself contains two smaller, distinct depressions.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Specificity:** The question is not asking for the total number of fossae (depressions) on the lacrimal bone, but specifically the number of depressions *contained within* the lacrimal recess.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The answer relies on the detailed scientific description published in a peer-reviewed journal by the paleontologists who studied the fossil directly. This is the most reliable source of information.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** Understanding terms like \"lacrimal,\" \"recess,\" \"fossa,\" and \"subsidiary\" is key to correctly interpreting the question and the scientific description. The lacrimal recess is the main depression, and it contains subsidiary depressions.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<2>>>"
