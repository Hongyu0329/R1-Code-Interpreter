    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0, 1]`, a circle `S^1`, or more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve or the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. The collection of all distinct composants of `X` forms a partition of `X`.\n*   **Product Space:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X × Y` is also a continuum under the product topology.\n\n**2. The Number of Composants and Decomposability**\n\nA crucial concept is the distinction between decomposable and indecomposable continua.\n*   A continuum `X` is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   A continuum `X` is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem that connects this property to the number of composants:\n*   A continuum has **exactly one** composant if and only if it is **decomposable**.\n*   A continuum has **more than one** composant if and only if it is **indecomposable**.\n\n**3. Decomposability of a Product Space**\n\nThe decomposability of the product space `X × Y` depends on the decomposability of its factors `X` and `Y`. A theorem by Kuratowski states:\n*   The product `X × Y` of two continua is **indecomposable** if and only if both `X` and `Y` are **indecomposable**.\n*   Consequently, `X × Y` is **decomposable** if at least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.\n\n**4. Maximizing the Number of Composants**\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible* number of composants.\n*   If either `X` or `Y` is decomposable, then the product `X × Y` is decomposable. In this case, `X × Y` has only **1** composant.\n*   To get more than one composant, we must choose `X` and `Y` such that their product `X × Y` is indecomposable. According to the theorem in Step 3, this requires that **both `X` and `Y` must be indecomposable continua**.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of composants of `X × Y` where `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n**5. The Number of Composants of an Indecomposable Continuum**\n\nNow we need to know how many composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n*   A famous theorem by the Polish mathematician S. Mazurkiewicz states that every indecomposable metric continuum has at least `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, `2^{\\aleph_0}`) composants.\n*   Furthermore, it can be shown that the number of composants cannot exceed `c`. This is because each composant is a distinct `F_σ`-set (a countable union of closed sets), and in a separable metric space (which any continuum is), there are exactly `c` such sets.\n*   Therefore, any indecomposable continuum has **exactly `c`** composants. Examples of such continua include the Knaster continuum (buckethandle) and the pseudo-arc.\n\n**6. The Composants of a Product of Indecomposable Continua**\n\nThere is a specific theorem by Krasinkiewicz and Minc that describes the composants of a product of indecomposable continua:\n*   If `X` and `Y` are indecomposable continua, then the composants of the product space `X × Y` are precisely the Cartesian products of the composants of `X` and the composants of `Y`.\n\nLet `\\mathcal{C}_X` be the set of composants of `X` and `\\mathcal{C}_Y` be the set of composants of `Y`. The set of composants of `X × Y` is `{ A × B | A ∈ \\mathcal{C}_X, B ∈ \\mathcal{C}_Y }`.\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\n\nTo find the largest possible number of composants, we take `X` and `Y` to be any two nondegenerate indecomposable continua.\n*   From Step 5, the number of composants of `X` is `|\\mathcal{C}_X| = c`.\n*   Similarly, the number of composants of `Y` is `|\\mathcal{C}_Y| = c`.\n*   From Step 6, the number of composants of `X × Y` is the product of the number of composants of the factors: `|\\mathcal{C}_X| × |\\mathcal{C}_Y|`.\n*   This product is `c × c`.\n*   Using cardinal arithmetic, `c × c = c^2 = (2^{\\aleph_0})^2 = 2^{2 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = c`.\n\nSo, when `X` and `Y` are indecomposable, the number of composants of their product is `c`. This is greater than 1 (the number of composants when one factor is decomposable).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is achieved when both nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y` are chosen to be indecomposable. In this case, the number of composants of `X × Y` is `c`.\n\nLet `c` denote the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
