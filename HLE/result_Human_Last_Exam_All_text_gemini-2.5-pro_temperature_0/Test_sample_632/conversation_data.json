    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n*   **Action:** It was removed.\n*   **Date:** In 1950.\n*   **Agent:** The city administration of Rome.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination of Common Misconceptions**\n*   A very famous feature once associated with the Pantheon itself were the two bell towers, nicknamed the \"donkey's ears,\" added by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the 17th century. However, these were removed in 1883, which does not match the 1950 date provided in the question. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n*   The central fountain (Fontana del Pantheon) with its Egyptian obelisk is still present in the square. While it has been modified over the centuries, it was not removed in 1950.\n*   The buildings surrounding the square are historic and were not subject to a major removal or demolition in 1950.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on the Specific Time Period (1950)**\nThe year 1950 is in the post-World War II era. This period in Rome, as in many other European cities, was marked by significant changes in urban planning and transportation. The focus began shifting from rail-based public transport to buses and private automobiles.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Feature**\n*   Historical photographs and city records from the first half of the 20th century show a prominent feature running directly through the Piazza della Rotonda: a **tramway line**.\n*   The metal tracks of the tram were embedded in the cobblestone pavement, passing between the Pantheon's portico and the central fountain.\n*   This tram line was a significant piece of urban infrastructure that defined the character, sound, and flow of the square for decades. It can be considered an \"architectural feature\" in the context of urban design.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm the Removal**\n*   In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the city administration of Rome made the decision to dismantle many tram lines within the historic center to ease congestion and modernize the traffic system in favor of buses.\n*   The tram line that passed through the Piazza della Rotonda was part of this program and was removed around 1950. Its removal fundamentally changed the square's function, transitioning it away from being a public transport thoroughfare.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the historical timeline and the specific details of the question, the unique architectural feature that was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 was the tramway line.\n\n<<<The tramway line (tram tracks)>>>"
