    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Define the manifold and the knot**\n\nLet $M$ be the manifold in question. It is the double branched cover of the 4-sphere $S^4$ over a certain 2-knot $\\mathcal{K}$. This is denoted as $M = \\Sigma_2(S^4, \\mathcal{K})$.\nThe 2-knot $\\mathcal{K}$ is the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil knot. Let $K$ denote the trefoil knot ($3_1$) in $S^3$. Then $\\mathcal{K} = \\tau_5(K)$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the fundamental group of the 2-knot complement**\n\nLet $G = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$ be the fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement. A standard presentation for the trefoil group is given by the Wirtinger presentation, which is isomorphic to the braid group $B_3$:\n$G = \\langle a, b \\mid aba = bab \\rangle$.\nHere, $a$ and $b$ are generators corresponding to arcs of the knot diagram, and they can be chosen to be meridians.\n\nA key result from knot theory (due to Zeeman and Gordon) states that the fundamental group of the complement of an $m$-twist-spun knot, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_m(K))$, is isomorphic to $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, provided $m \\neq 0$. In our case, $m=5$.\nLet's denote the group of the complement by $H = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\mathcal{K})$. So, $H \\cong G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the fundamental group of the double branched cover**\n\nThe fundamental group of the $n$-fold cyclic branched cover of $S^4$ over a 2-knot $\\mathcal{K}$ is given by the quotient of the knot complement group $H$ by the normal subgroup generated by the $n$-th power of a meridian element $\\mu$.\n$\\pi_1(\\Sigma_n(S^4, \\mathcal{K})) = H / \\langle\\langle \\mu^n \\rangle\\rangle$.\n\nIn our case, $n=2$. We need to identify a meridian $\\mu$ of the 2-knot $\\mathcal{K}$ in the group $H \\cong G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe group $H$ can be presented as $H = \\langle G, t \\mid t g t^{-1} = x^m g x^{-m} \\text{ for all } g \\in G \\rangle$, where $x$ is a meridian of the original knot $K$ and $t$ is a meridian of the 2-knot $\\mathcal{K}$.\nLet's choose the meridian of the trefoil to be $x=a$. With $m=5$, the relations are $t g t^{-1} = a^5 g a^{-5}$.\nLet $h = a^{-5}t$. Then $t = a^5 h$. The relation becomes $(a^5 h) g (a^5 h)^{-1} = a^5 g a^{-5}$, which simplifies to $h g h^{-1} = g$. This means $h$ commutes with all elements of $G$. The group $H$ is generated by $G$ and $h$, and the relations are those of $G$ plus the fact that $h$ is central. This confirms $H \\cong G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, where the $\\mathbb{Z}$ factor is generated by $h$.\n\nThe meridian of $\\mathcal{K}$ is $\\mu = t$. In terms of the generators of $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, we have $\\mu = a^5 h$.\n\nNow we compute the fundamental group of our manifold $M$, which we will call $\\Pi$:\n$\\Pi = \\pi_1(M) = H / \\langle\\langle \\mu^2 \\rangle\\rangle = (G \\times \\langle h \\rangle) / \\langle\\langle (a^5 h)^2 \\rangle\\rangle$.\n\nSince $h$ is central, it commutes with $a^5$. So, $(a^5 h)^2 = (a^5)^2 h^2 = a^{10} h^2$.\nBecause $a^{10}h^2$ is a central element, the normal subgroup it generates is simply the cyclic group $\\langle a^{10}h^2 \\rangle$.\nSo, the fundamental group $\\Pi$ has the presentation:\n$\\Pi = \\langle a, b, h \\mid aba=bab, [a,h]=1, [b,h]=1, a^{10}h^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the minimal number of generators of $\\Pi$**\n\nThe minimal number of generators of a group $\\Pi$, denoted $d(\\Pi)$, is the smallest size of a generating set for $\\Pi$.\n\n*   **Lower Bound:** The number of generators of a group is always greater than or equal to the number of generators of its abelianization, $\\Pi_{ab}$.\n    To find $\\Pi_{ab}$, we add the relation $[a,b]=1$ to the presentation of $\\Pi$. The relation $aba=bab$ becomes $a^2b=b^2a$, which implies $a=b$ (since they commute).\n    The group $\\Pi_{ab}$ is therefore generated by the images of $a$ and $h$, which we denote $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{h}$. The relations are that they commute, and $\\bar{a}^{10}\\bar{h}^2=1$.\n    So, $\\Pi_{ab} = \\langle \\bar{a}, \\bar{h} \\mid [\\bar{a},\\bar{h}]=1, \\bar{a}^{10}\\bar{h}^2=1 \\rangle$.\n    This is an abelian group with 2 generators and 1 relation. Using the classification of finitely generated abelian groups, the relation matrix is $(10 \\ \\ 2)$. Its Smith Normal Form is $(2 \\ \\ 0)$, which means the group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    The minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ is 2.\n    Therefore, $d(\\Pi) \\ge d(\\Pi_{ab}) = 2$.\n\n*   **Upper Bound:** We now try to find a generating set for $\\Pi$ of size 2.\n    The group $\\Pi$ is generated by $\\{a, b, h\\}$. Let's test the set $\\{a, bh\\}$.\n    Let $g_1 = a$ and $g_2 = bh$.\n    1.  We have $g_1 = a$.\n    2.  Consider $g_2^2 = (bh)^2$. Since $b$ and $h$ commute, this is $b^2h^2$.\n    3.  From the relation $a^{10}h^2=1$, we have $h^2 = a^{-10}$.\n    4.  Substituting this, we get $g_2^2 = b^2 a^{-10}$.\n    5.  From the elements we have, we can form $g_2^2 g_1^{10} = (b^2 a^{-10}) a^{10} = b^2$.\n    6.  So, the subgroup generated by $\\{g_1, g_2\\}$ contains both $a$ and $b^2$.\n    7.  Now we use a known result for the trefoil group $G = \\langle a, b \\mid aba=bab \\rangle \\cong B_3$. The subgroup generated by $\\{a, b^k\\}$ generates all of $G$ if and only if $\\gcd(k, 3) = 1$.\n    8.  In our case, we have generated $a$ and $b^2$. Since $\\gcd(2, 3) = 1$, the subgroup $\\langle a, b^2 \\rangle$ generates the entire trefoil group $G$. This means we can write $b$ as a word in $a$ and $b^2$.\n    9.  Therefore, the subgroup $\\langle g_1, g_2 \\rangle$ contains all of $G$.\n    10. Finally, we must show we can generate $h$. We have $g_2 = bh$. We can write $h = b^{-1} g_2$. Since $b$ (which is in $G$) and $g_2$ are both in the subgroup $\\langle g_1, g_2 \\rangle$, $h$ must be in it as well.\n    11. Since $\\{g_1, g_2\\} = \\{a, bh\\}$ can generate all the original generators $\\{a, b, h\\}$, it is a valid generating set for $\\Pi$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the minimal number of generators $d(\\Pi)$ satisfies $d(\\Pi) \\ge 2$ and we have found a generating set of size 2. Therefore, the minimal number of generators is exactly 2."
