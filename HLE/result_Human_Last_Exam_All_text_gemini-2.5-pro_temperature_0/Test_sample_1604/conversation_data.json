    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nThe goal is to identify which of the battles painted by the artist Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler, occurred most recently in history. This requires us to list her famous battle paintings, identify the historical event each one depicts, and then find the date of each event to compare them. The key is the date of the battle, not the date the painting was created.\n\n### Step 2: List Notable Battle Paintings by Lady Butler and Identify the Depicted Events\nWe will compile a list of Lady Butler's well-known military paintings and the specific battles or campaigns they represent.\n\n1.  ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the **Battle of Quatre Bras**.\n2.  ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo**.\n3.  ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted 1879): Depicts William Brydon arriving at Jalalabad as the sole survivor of a 16,500-strong column, marking the end of the **1842 retreat from Kabul** during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n4.  ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts a roll call of the Grenadier Guards after the **Battle of Inkerman** during the Crimean War.\n5.  ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the **Battle of Balaclava**, also during the Crimean War.\n6.  ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the **Battle of Rorke's Drift** during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n7.  ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882): Depicts an incident involving Lieutenant Robert Elwes at the **Battle of Laing's Nek** during the First Boer War.\n8.  ***The Camel Corps*** (painted 1886): Depicts the British Army's Camel Corps during the **Gordon Relief Expedition** (part of the Mahdist War) in the Sudan.\n9.  ***The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia*** (painted 1917): Depicts a cavalry charge during the **Action of Agagia** in Egypt, part of the Senussi Campaign during World War I.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Historical Date of Each Battle/Event\nNow, we find the date for each of the events identified in the previous step.\n\n*   **Battle of Quatre Bras**: June 16, 1815\n*   **Battle of Waterloo**: June 18, 1815\n*   **Retreat from Kabul**: January 1842\n*   **Battle of Balaclava**: October 25, 1854\n*   **Battle of Inkerman**: November 5, 1854\n*   **Battle of Rorke's Drift**: January 22–23, 1879\n*   **Battle of Laing's Nek**: January 28, 1881\n*   **Gordon Relief Expedition**: Late 1884 – January 1885\n*   **Action of Agagia**: February 26, 1916\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Dates and Find the Latest One\nLet's list the years of the events in chronological order to easily identify the latest one.\n\n1.  1815 (Quatre Bras, Waterloo)\n2.  1842 (Retreat from Kabul)\n3.  1854 (Balaclava, Inkerman)\n4.  1879 (Rorke's Drift)\n5.  1881 (Laing's Nek)\n6.  1885 (Gordon Relief Expedition)\n7.  **1916** (Action of Agagia)\n\n### Conclusion\nBy comparing the dates of the historical events depicted in Lady Butler's paintings, the latest one is the **Action of Agagia**, which occurred in **1916** during World War I. This battle is the subject of her 1917 painting, *The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia*.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Date of Battle vs. Date of Painting:** It is crucial to focus on when the battle happened, not when the artist painted it. For example, *The Roll Call* was painted in 1874, but the Battle of Inkerman it depicts was in 1854.\n*   **Identifying the Correct Event:** Some painting titles are not explicit. *Floreat Etona!* requires research to connect it to the Battle of Laing's Nek.\n*   **Comprehensiveness:** The analysis must include a wide range of her work, especially her later paintings, to ensure the actual latest battle is found. Her painting of the Action of Agagia is one of her later works and depicts a 20th-century event.\n\n<<<The Action of Agagia"
