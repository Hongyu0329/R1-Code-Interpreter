    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Musical Terminology**\n\n*   **The Beatles:** The legendary British rock band.\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord that feels like the point of rest or resolution. If a song is in the key of A minor, the tonic chord is A minor. If it's in C major, the tonic is C major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is a minor chord built on the fifth note of the song's key.\n    *   For example, in the key of A minor, the notes of the scale are A, B, C, D, E, F, G. The fifth note is E. A minor chord built on E is E minor (E-G-B). This is the \"minor fifth chord\" (v).\n    *   This is distinct from the \"dominant\" or \"major fifth\" chord (V), which would be E major (E-G#-B) and is often used in minor keys to create a stronger pull back to the tonic.\n*   **Chord Jump:** The question specifies that the song *starts* with this progression. This means the very first chord is the tonic, and the second chord is the minor fifth.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nWe are looking for a song that starts with the progression **i -> v** (Tonic minor -> Minor fifth). This progression creates a distinctively melancholic or modal sound. Let's examine some candidates.\n\n*   **\"And I Love Her\":** The song's famous opening guitar riff consists of an F# minor chord followed by a C# minor chord. While this is a jump from a minor chord to another minor chord a fifth below, the main verse of the song is in the key of C# minor. Therefore, the song's intro starts on the subdominant chord (iv, F# minor) and moves to the tonic (i, C# minor). It does not start on the tonic.\n\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\":** This song is in the key of A minor. It begins with a strummed A minor chord (the tonic, i). The very next chord is an E minor chord (the minor fifth, v). This perfectly matches the criteria.\n\n*   **\"Michelle\":** This song's verse is in the key of F minor. It begins with an F minor chord (the tonic, i). The second chord in the progression is a C minor chord (the minor fifth, v). This also perfectly matches the criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Select the Best Answer**\n\nBoth \"Things We Said Today\" and \"Michelle\" are correct according to a literal interpretation of the question. However, in music trivia, there is often a single, most famous or illustrative example intended as the answer.\n\n*   The opening of \"Michelle\" (Fm -> Cm -> Db -> C) is one of the most celebrated harmonic progressions in The Beatles' catalog. The initial jump from the tonic (Fm) to the minor fifth (Cm) is the crucial first step that establishes the song's sophisticated, French-inspired, and melancholic mood. It is a textbook example of this harmonic device and is arguably more famous and musically defining than the progression in \"Things We Said Today\".\n\nTherefore, \"Michelle\" is the strongest and most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
