    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a unit with four specific characteristics:\n    *   **Unit Type:** Flying unit.\n    *   **Building Tier:** Comes from a Tier 1 (T1) building (specifically, a T1 Air Plant).\n    *   **Ability 1:** Can shoot (has a weapon).\n    *   **Ability 2:** Can stun enemy targets.\n\n2.  **Examine Tier 1 Flying Units (Cortex Faction):**\n    *   **Vamp (Fighter):** A fast anti-air fighter. It shoots with a laser but does not have a stun ability.\n    *   **Shuriken (Gunship):** A gunship designed for attacking ground targets. It shoots with a chaingun but does not have a stun ability.\n    *   **Locust (Bomber):** A light bomber that drops bombs on ground targets. It attacks but does not stun.\n    *   **Scout:** An unarmed reconnaissance plane. It cannot shoot.\n    *   *Conclusion for Cortex:* No T1 flying unit from the Cortex faction can stun.\n\n3.  **Examine Tier 1 Flying Units (Armada Faction):**\n    *   **Fighter:** A fast anti-air fighter. It shoots with a laser but does not have a stun ability.\n    *   **Thunder (Gunship):** A gunship designed for attacking ground targets. It shoots with a plasma cannon but does not have a stun ability.\n    *   **Lancer (Bomber):** A light bomber that drops bombs on ground targets. It attacks but does not stun.\n    *   **Scout:** An unarmed reconnaissance plane. It cannot shoot.\n    *   *Conclusion for Armada:* No T1 flying unit from the Armada faction can stun.\n\n4.  **Identify Units with Stun Abilities:** Now, let's identify units that *can* stun and see if they match the other criteria.\n    *   **Armada Stunner:** This is a T1 vehicle built from the T1 Vehicle Plant. It shoots an EMP laser that stuns targets. However, it is a **ground vehicle**, not a flying unit.\n    *   **Cortex Wasp:** This is a T2 gunship built from the T2 Air Plant. It is a flying unit that shoots EMP rockets to stun targets. However, it is a **Tier 2 unit**, not Tier 1.\n    *   **Armada Stiletto:** This is a T2 gunship built from the T2 Air Plant. It is a flying unit that shoots EMP missiles to stun targets. However, it is a **Tier 2 unit**, not Tier 1.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Tier vs. Type:** It is crucial to distinguish between the unit's tier (T1) and its type (flying). The Armada **Stunner** is T1 but is a ground vehicle.\n*   **Stun as a Specific Ability:** Stun is a distinct mechanic (usually EMP-based) and is not a feature of standard T1 air weapons.\n*   **Conclusion:** After reviewing all T1 flying units for both factions and cross-referencing with units that have stun capabilities, it's clear that no single unit satisfies all conditions of the question. The question is based on a false premise.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, there is no flying unit from a Tier 1 building in BAR that can shoot and stun enemy targets. The ability to stun from the air is exclusive to Tier 2 gunships (Wasp and Stiletto), while the Tier 1 stun capability is limited to a ground vehicle (Stunner).\n\n<<<There is no flying unit from a Tier 1 building in BAR that can shoot and stun enemy targets. The stun ability for flying units is only available on Tier 2 units like the Cortex Wasp or the Armada Stiletto. The only Tier 1 unit that can stun is the Armada Stunner, which is a ground vehicle.>>>"
