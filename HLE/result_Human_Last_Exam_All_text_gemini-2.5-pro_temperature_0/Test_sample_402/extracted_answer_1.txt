This strategy involves a two-pass differential expression analysis. **First**, run a preliminary differential expression analysis on the full dataset comparing `CAR_IL15` vs. `CAR_only` using a paired design (`~donor + condition`). **Second**, from these preliminary results, create a list of contaminant genes by filtering for those with a highly significant and large negative log2 fold change (e.g., `log2FoldChange < -4` and `FDR < 0.05`), as these represent genes from cancer cells that are absent in the cleaner `CAR_IL15` samples. **Third**, use this gene list to remove the corresponding rows from the **original raw count matrix** using a command-line tool like `grep`. **Finally**, re-run the entire differential expression analysis, including normalization, on this new, filtered count matrix to obtain a corrected and unbiased set of results for downstream biological interpretation.
