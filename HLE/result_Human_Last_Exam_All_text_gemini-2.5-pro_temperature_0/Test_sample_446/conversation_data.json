    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Biological Concept**\nThe question asks to identify a peptide that binds to an integrin receptor. Integrins are a family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. A key recognition motif for many integrins is the tripeptide sequence Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid, abbreviated as RGD. This sequence is found in several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins like fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Provided Peptide Sequences**\nAll five answer choices are short peptides that begin with the RGD sequence:\nA. RGDMAA\nB. RGDSPSS\nC. RGDLTTP\nD. RGDQVSK\nE. RGDARGG\n\nSince all options contain the essential RGD motif, the binding affinity and specificity must be determined by the amino acids that flank this core sequence. The conformation of the peptide and the identity of the amino acid immediately following the Aspartic acid (D) are particularly important.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Peptide Based on Known Integrin-Binding Motifs**\nWe need to compare the flanking sequences in each option to those found in natural integrin ligands or well-studied synthetic peptides.\n\n*   **The Fibronectin Motif:** The most well-characterized RGD-containing protein is fibronectin. The specific sequence in fibronectin that binds to integrins (like α5β1) is **RGDS** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine). Peptides containing this RGDS sequence are widely used in research as potent inhibitors of cell adhesion because they compete with fibronectin for integrin binding.\n\n*   **The Vitronectin Motif:** Another important ECM protein, vitronectin, uses the sequence **RGDV** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Valine) to bind to integrins (like αvβ3).\n\n*   **Evaluating the Choices:**\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** The amino acid following RGD is Methionine (M). This is not a classic high-affinity sequence.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** The sequence immediately following RGD is **S** (Serine). This creates the **RGDS** motif, which is the canonical binding site from fibronectin. Peptides containing RGDS are known to bind strongly to integrins. The full peptide RGDSPSS is very similar to the natural fibronectin sequence (often cited as GRGDSPK) and is therefore highly likely to be an effective integrin binder.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** The amino acid following RGD is Leucine (L). This is not a common high-affinity motif.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** The amino acid following RGD is Glutamine (Q). This is also not a classic high-affinity sequence.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** The amino acid following RGD is Alanine (A). While it can bind, the **RGDA** sequence is known to have a significantly lower affinity for many integrins compared to RGDS. In some studies, peptides with sequences like RGE (Arginine-Glycine-Glutamic acid) or RGDA are used as negative or low-affinity controls to demonstrate the specificity of RGD-mediated binding.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\nThe peptide **RGDSPSS** contains the RGDS motif, which is the well-established, high-affinity integrin-binding sequence from fibronectin. Therefore, out of all the given options, it is the one that has been extensively found to bind, and is the most likely to bind, an integrin receptor with high affinity in an in vitro assay.\n\n<<<B>>>"
