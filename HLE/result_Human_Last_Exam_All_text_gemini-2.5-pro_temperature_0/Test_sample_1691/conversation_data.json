    "An analysis of the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the source of the dominant contribution.**\nLet $f(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$.\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$ becomes large where $f(x)$ is small.\nWe analyze the function $f(x)$ on the interval $[0, 15]$.\n$f(0) = 0$.\nThe derivative is $f'(x) = 45x^4 + 30x^5 + 72x^7 = x^4(45 + 30x + 72x^3)$.\nFor $x \\in [0, 15]$, $f'(x) \\ge 0$, so $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing. The minimum of $f(x)$ is at $x=0$.\nThe dominant contribution to the integral for small $\\epsilon$ comes from the neighborhood of $x=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the behavior near the singularity.**\nNear $x=0$, we can approximate $f(x)$ by its leading term: $f(x) \\approx 9x^5$.\nThe integral is dominated by the behavior of $\\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$ for some small $\\delta > 0$.\nThis type of integral is known to produce a singular term in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the leading term of the asymptotic expansion.**\nThe leading behavior of an integral of the form $\\int_0^L \\frac{h(x)}{\\epsilon + g(x)} dx$, where $g(x) \\approx ax^n$ for small $x$ and $h(0) \\neq 0$, is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\sim h(0) \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + ax^n}$.\nLet's evaluate this integral. We use the substitution $x = (\\epsilon/a)^{1/n} y$, so $dx = (\\epsilon/a)^{1/n} dy$.\n$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{(\\epsilon/a)^{1/n} dy}{\\epsilon + a((\\epsilon/a)^{1/n}y)^n} = \\frac{(\\epsilon/a)^{1/n}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dy}{1+y^n} = a^{-1/n} \\epsilon^{1/n - 1} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dy}{1+y^n}$.\nThe integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dy}{1+y^n}$ can be evaluated using the Beta function, and the result is $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$.\nSo, the leading term is $h(0) a^{-1/n} \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)} \\epsilon^{1/n-1}$.\n\nIn our case, $h(x)=1$, $g(x)=f(x)$, $a=9.0$, and $n=5.0$.\nThe power of $\\epsilon$ is $1/5 - 1 = -4/5$.\nThe coefficient is $1 \\cdot 9^{-1/5} \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\nSo, the leading term of the approximation is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\sim \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the next term in the approximation.**\nFor this class of integrals, the asymptotic expansion for small $\\epsilon$ is of the form:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\epsilon^{1/n-1} + D + o(1)$.\nThe constant term $D$ is given by the finite part of the integral of $1/f(x)$, which is divergent at $x=0$. This is known as the Hadamard finite part or principal value of the integral.\n$D = \\text{FP} \\int_0^{15} \\frac{dx}{f(x)} = \\text{FP} \\int_0^{15} \\frac{dx}{9x^5+5x^6+9x^8}$.\n\nThe finite part is defined by expanding the integrand in a Laurent series around the singularity, integrating the regular part, and adding the finite contributions from the singular terms.\nLet $P(x)$ be the singular part of the Laurent series of $1/f(x)$ at $x=0$.\n$D = \\int_0^{15} \\left(\\frac{1}{f(x)} - P(x)\\right) dx + \\text{FP} \\int_0^{15} P(x) dx$.\nThe integral $\\int_0^{15} (\\frac{1}{f(x)} - P(x)) dx$ is now convergent. The finite part of the integral of the singular terms is obtained by formally integrating and discarding any divergent terms at the lower limit. For a term $c_k/x^k$ with $k>1$, its contribution to the finite part is $c_k \\frac{15^{1-k}}{1-k}$. For a term $c_1/x$, its contribution is $c_1 \\ln(15)$.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the final analytical approximation.**\nCombining the leading singular term and the constant term, we get the analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$.\nThe formula is of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx A \\epsilon^{-4/5} + B$, where:\n- $A$ is the coefficient of the leading singular term.\n- $B$ is the constant term, given by the finite part of the divergent integral.\n\n$A = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n$B = \\text{FP} \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8} dx$\n\nThis provides a complete analytical formula for the approximation.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe analytical formula is $I(\\epsilon) \\approx A \\epsilon^{-p} + B$.\nFrom our analysis:\n- The power is $p = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 = 0.8$.\n- The coefficient $A = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n- The constant $B = \\text{FP} \\int_0^{15} \\frac{dx}{9x^5+5x^6+9x^8}$.\n\nThe question asks for the analytical formula.\n\n<<<I(epsilon) = (pi / (5 * 9^(1/5) * sin(pi/5))) * epsilon^(-4/5) + FP(Integral from 0 to 15 of 1/(9*x^5 + 5*x^6 + 9*x^8) dx)>>>"
