    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify all historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad.**\n\nFirst, we must comb through the text of the Iliad to find all references to specific, real-world mountains.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The most prominent mountain, home of the gods. It is mentioned throughout the epic. The question asks for the next tallest after this one.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain, located near Troy, is a key location. Zeus and other gods frequently observe the battle from its peaks (e.g., Iliad, Book 8 and Book 14). It is important not to confuse this with the Mount Ida in Crete, which is not the one featured in the Trojan War narrative.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Samos of Thrace):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon watches the Trojan War from \"the highest peak of wooded Samos, the isle of Thrace.\" This refers to the island of Samothrace, whose highest point is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Mount Ida, her path takes her \"over the snowy mountains of the horsemen of Thrace... and came to Athos.\"\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly is mentioned as the source of the ash-wood for Achilles' famous spear, a gift from his father Peleus (e.g., Iliad, Book 16).\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain in Lydia (modern-day Turkey) is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Iliad, Book 2) as the location of the Maeonians, \"who were born in the land of Gyge under the snows of Tmolus.\"\n*   **Mount Sipylus:** In the final book (Book 24), Achilles tells Priam the story of Niobe, who was turned to stone and continues her grief \"on lonely mountains, on Sipylus.\"\n\n**Step 2: Find the modern elevations of these mountains.**\n\nTo compare their heights, we must look up the current accepted elevations for these real-world locations.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus** (Greece): 2,918 meters (9,573 ft)\n*   **Mount Tmolus** (Modern name: Bozdağ, Turkey): 2,159 meters (7,083 ft)\n*   **Mount Athos** (Greece): 2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n*   **Mount Ida** (Modern name: Kaz Dağı, Turkey): 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion** (Greece): 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n*   **Mount Samothrace** (Modern name: Mount Fengari, Greece): 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n*   **Mount Sipylus** (Modern name: Manisa Dağı, Turkey): 1,513 meters (4,964 ft)\n\n**Step 3: Rank the mountains by height to find the second tallest.**\n\nNow, we can arrange the mountains in descending order of elevation to find the one that comes after Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 m\n2.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,159 m\n3.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n4.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n6.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n7.  **Mount Sipylus:** 1,513 m\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the answer.**\n\nBased on the ranking, the tallest mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify all mountains explicitly named in the epic.\n*   **Context:** Understanding the context of the mention is important. Some mountains are central to the action (Olympus, Ida), while others are part of a travelogue (Athos) or a backstory/simile (Pelion, Tmolus, Sipylus).\n*   **Geographic Accuracy:** One must correctly identify the modern locations and names of these ancient mountains (e.g., \"Samos of Thrace\" is Samothrace, not the island of Samos).\n*   **Data Source:** The final answer relies on modern elevation data, which is the only objective measure available for comparison.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter a step-by-step analysis of the mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their respective elevations, the tallest after Mount Olympus is identified.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
