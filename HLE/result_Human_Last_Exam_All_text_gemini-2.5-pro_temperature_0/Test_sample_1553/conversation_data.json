    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Novel and Main Character:** The novel is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Relationships:** Upon his \"resurrection,\" Adam Zamoyski is assigned a guide and protector. This guide is a post-human entity, a \"stahs\" (Standard Homo Sapiens), named Angelina.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Nature of the Relationship:** The relationship between Adam and Angelina is central to the plot. It evolves from a purely functional guide-and-ward dynamic into a deep, complex, and intimate bond. They become reliant on each other for survival and understanding in the vastly changed universe.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Concept of \"Marriage\" in the Novel's Context:** The world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a post-human one where traditional human concepts are often redefined or transcended. A formal, 21st-century-style marriage ceremony does not occur. However, the term \"marries\" in the context of the question refers to the formation of a permanent, life-altering, symbiotic union.\n\n5.  **Determine the Climactic Union:** Towards the end of the novel, the bond between Adam and Angelina becomes so profound that they essentially merge, forming a single, cohesive unit to navigate their reality. This deep, permanent union is the narrative's equivalent of a marriage.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The main character is Adam Zamoyski.\n*   The character he forms the union with is Angelina.\n*   The \"marriage\" is not a traditional ceremony but a deep, symbiotic bonding, which is a common theme in Dukaj's post-humanist fiction. One must look beyond the literal definition of the word \"marry\" and understand it in the context of the story's themes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the plot and the central relationship in the novel, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, \"marries\" or forms a permanent, marriage-equivalent union with is Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
