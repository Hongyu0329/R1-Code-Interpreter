    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the polynomial**\n\nLet the given polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nWe can write $f(x)$ as $g(x) + 22$, where $g(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\nThe polynomial $g(x)$ is related to the Chebyshev-like polynomials $P_n(x)$ defined by the property $P_n(2\\cos\\theta) = 2\\cos(n\\theta)$. The first few are $P_1(x)=x$, $P_2(x)=x^2-2$, etc., and specifically $P_7(x) = x^7 - 7x^5 + 14x^3 - 7x$.\n\nLet's see how $g(x)$ is related to $P_7(x)$. Consider a change of variable $x \\to x/d$ and a scaling by $c$.\nLet's try to match the coefficients of $g(x)$ with $c P_7(x/d) = c((x/d)^7 - 7(x/d)^5 + 14(x/d)^3 - 7(x/d))$.\nThis gives $\\frac{c}{d^7}x^7 - \\frac{7c}{d^5}x^5 + \\frac{14c}{d^3}x^3 - \\frac{7c}{d}x$.\nComparing the coefficient of $x^7$ with that of $g(x)$, we get $c/d^7 = 1$, so $c=d^7$.\nComparing the coefficient of $x^5$, we get $-7c/d^5 = -7d^7/d^5 = -7d^2 = -14$, which implies $d^2=2$.\nLet's choose $d=\\sqrt{2}$. Then $c=(\\sqrt{2})^7$.\nChecking the other coefficients:\nFor $x^3$: $14c/d^3 = 14d^4 = 14(d^2)^2 = 14(2^2) = 56$. This matches.\nFor $x$: $-7c/d = -7d^6 = -7(d^2)^3 = -7(2^3) = -56$. This also matches.\nSo, we have the relation $g(x) = (\\sqrt{2})^7 P_7(x/\\sqrt{2})$. This transformation is defined over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of $f(x)$**\n\nThe problem asks for the density of primes $p$ where $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$. By the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ that act as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. For a degree 7 polynomial, this means the proportion of 7-cycles in $G$. So, we need to find the Galois group of $f(x)$.\n\n1.  **Irreducibility of f(x) over $\\mathbb{Q}$**:\n    We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\n    The coefficients of $f(x)$ are $a_7=1, a_6=0, a_5=-14, a_4=0, a_3=56, a_2=0, a_1=-56, a_0=22$.\n    - $p=2$ does not divide $a_7=1$.\n    - $p=2$ divides all other coefficients $a_6, a_5, \\dots, a_0$.\n    - $p^2=4$ does not divide $a_0=22$.\n    Thus, by Eisenstein's criterion, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n2.  **The Galois group of g(x)**:\n    The roots of $P_7(y)=0$ are $y_k = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{14}\\right)$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 6$.\n    The roots of $g(x)=0$ are $x_k = d \\cdot y_k = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{(2k+1)\\pi}{14}\\right)$.\n    The splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{2}, \\cos(\\pi/14)\\right)$.\n    The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(\\pi/14))$ is the maximal real subfield of the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{28})$, where $\\zeta_{28}=e^{2\\pi i/28}$.\n    The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{28})/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/28\\mathbb{Z})^*$, which has order $\\phi(28)=\\phi(4)\\phi(7)=2 \\cdot 6=12$. This group is isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_6$.\n    The Galois group of the maximal real subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(\\pi/14))$ is the quotient $(\\mathbb{Z}/28\\mathbb{Z})^*/\\{\\pm 1\\}$, which is isomorphic to $C_6$.\n    The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ has Galois group $C_2$.\n    The intersection of the fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(\\pi/14))$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$, because the quadratic subfields of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{28})$ are $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{7})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{7})$, none of which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Therefore, the Galois group of the compositum field $K_g$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n    $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\cos(\\pi/14))/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_6$.\n    Since $C_2 \\times C_6$ is an abelian group, the splitting field of $g(x)$ is an abelian extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n3.  **The Galois group of f(x)**:\n    We use a theorem by R. Brandl which states that if $g(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ has an abelian splitting field and $c \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, then the polynomial $f(x)=g(x)-c$ is either reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ or its splitting field is also abelian.\n    In our case, $g(x)$ has an abelian splitting field, $c=-22 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, and we have shown that $f(x)=g(x)+22$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Therefore, the Galois group of $f(x)$, let's call it $G_f$, must be an abelian group.\n    Since $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 7, its Galois group $G_f$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n    A fundamental result in group theory states that a transitive abelian subgroup of $S_n$ must be regular, which implies its order is $n$.\n    In our case, $n=7$, so $|G_f|=7$.\n    The only group of order 7 (up to isomorphism) is the cyclic group of order 7, denoted $C_7$.\n    So, the Galois group of $f(x)$ is $G_f \\cong C_7$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the density**\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of prime numbers $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is given by the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G_f$ that are 7-cycles.\nThe group $G_f = C_7$ has 7 elements. It is generated by an element $\\sigma$ of order 7. The elements are $\\{e, \\sigma, \\sigma^2, \\sigma^3, \\sigma^4, \\sigma^5, \\sigma^6\\}$.\n- The identity element $e$ corresponds to a permutation with cycle structure (1,1,1,1,1,1,1).\n- The other 6 elements, $\\sigma^k$ for $k=1, \\dots, 6$, are all generators of the group and have order 7. An element of order 7 in $S_7$ must be a 7-cycle.\nSo, there are 6 elements in $G_f$ that are 7-cycles.\nThe proportion of 7-cycles in $G_f$ is $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles}}{|G_f|} = \\frac{6}{7}$.\n\nThis can also be seen from the general formula for a polynomial with a cyclic Galois group $C_n$. The density of primes for which the polynomial is irreducible is $\\phi(n)/n$. For $n=7$, this is $\\phi(7)/7 = (7-1)/7 = 6/7$.\n\nThe natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$ is $6/7$."
