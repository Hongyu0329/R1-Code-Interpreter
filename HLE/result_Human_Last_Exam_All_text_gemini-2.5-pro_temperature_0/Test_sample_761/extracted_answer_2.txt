No. Polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They differ fundamentally in their monomer units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), the chemical bonds linking the monomers (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic bonds), and their elemental composition (polynucleotides contain phosphorus and nitrogen, which polysaccharides lack).
