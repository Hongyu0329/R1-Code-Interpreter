    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept: Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a sound rule in the history of the English language. It states that a tense vowel (like the \"a\" in `sane` or the \"i\" in `divine`) becomes a lax vowel (like the \"a\" in `sanity` or the \"i\" in `divinity`) when it occurs in the third-to-last syllable of a word.\n\nFor TSL to occur, two main conditions must be met:\n1.  The word must have at least three syllables.\n2.  The vowel in question must be in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable and must be tense in a related, shorter word.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word in the list based on the TSL rule.**\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   Pronunciation: /ˈsʌðərn/ (two syllables: `south-ern`).\n    *   Related word: `south` /saʊθ/, which has a tense diphthong /aʊ/.\n    *   Analysis: The word `southern` only has two syllables. Therefore, the rule of Trisyllabic Laxing cannot apply. While the vowel has been laxed (from /aʊ/ to /ʌ/), it's due to a different shortening rule, not TSL.\n    *   *Careful point*: The word does not meet the three-syllable requirement.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   Pronunciation: /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/ (four syllables: `de-riv-a-tive`).\n    *   Related word: `derive` /dɪˈraɪv/, which has a tense diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   Analysis: The root vowel /aɪ/ is in the second syllable (`-riv-`), which is the third from the end (antepenultimate). In `derivative`, this vowel has become the lax vowel /ɪ/.\n    *   *Conclusion*: This is a classic example of a word that **has undergone** Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   Pronunciation: /səˈrɛnɪti/ (four syllables: `se-ren-i-ty`).\n    *   Related word: `serene` /səˈriːn/, which has a tense vowel /iː/.\n    *   Analysis: The root vowel /iː/ is in the second syllable (`-ren-`), which is the third from the end. In `serenity`, this vowel has become the lax vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   *Conclusion*: This is another clear example of a word that **has undergone** Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   Pronunciation: /ˈplɛzənt/ (two syllables: `pleas-ant`).\n    *   Related word: `please` /pliːz/, which has a tense vowel /iː/.\n    *   Analysis: The word `pleasant` only has two syllables, so Trisyllabic Laxing cannot apply. The laxing of the vowel (from /iː/ to /ɛ/) is due to a different rule called pre-cluster shortening.\n    *   *Careful point*: The word does not meet the three-syllable requirement.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   Pronunciation: /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/ (three syllables: `grat-i-tude`).\n    *   Related word: `grateful` /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/, which has a tense diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   Analysis: The root vowel /eɪ/ is in the first syllable (`grat-`), which is the third from the end. In `gratitude`, this vowel has become the lax vowel /æ/.\n    *   *Conclusion*: This word **has undergone** Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   Pronunciation: /ˈʃædoʊ/ (two syllables: `shad-ow`).\n    *   Related word: None in Modern English that shows a tense/lax alternation. Its origin is Old English `sceadu`, where the first vowel was already short (lax).\n    *   Analysis: The word only has two syllables, so TSL cannot apply. Furthermore, unlike `southern` or `pleasant`, there is no related base word with a tense vowel from which its vowel was laxed. The vowel has been historically lax.\n    *   *Careful point*: This word fails the TSL conditions on two counts: it is not trisyllabic, and its vowel was never tense to begin with in a way that would trigger laxing.\n\n**Step 3: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nWe are looking for the word that has **not** undergone Trisyllabic Laxing.\n*   `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` have all clearly undergone TSL.\n*   `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow` have not undergone TSL, primarily because they are not three syllables long.\n\nHowever, the question asks for a single answer. We must choose the best fit. While `southern` and `pleasant` did not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing, they did undergo other vowel laxing processes. `shadow` is unique in the list because not only did it not undergo TSL, its vowel was never subject to this kind of laxing from a tense counterpart at all. It has always been lax. Therefore, it is the most definitive example of a word that has not undergone the process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
