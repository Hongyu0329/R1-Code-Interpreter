    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Properties of the Conductor and Character**\n\n*   **Dirichlet Character:** A function $\\chi: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ associated with a modulus $N$. It's completely multiplicative and periodic.\n*   **Conductor:** The conductor of a character $\\chi$ is the smallest modulus $d$ for which $\\chi$ can be defined. A character is called **primitive** if its modulus is equal to its conductor.\n*   **Order of a Character:** The smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\chi(n)^k = 1$ for all $n$ with $\\gcd(n, d) = 1$.\n*   **Structure of Characters:** The group of Dirichlet characters modulo $N$, denoted $(\\widehat{\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}})^*$, is isomorphic to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}})^*$. If $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$, then a character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n**2. Factorize the Conductor**\n\nThe given conductor is $d = 53599$. We need to find its prime factorization.\n*   $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, 5.\n*   $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n*   $7657 \\div 13 = 589$ (Wait, let me recheck. $53599/13 = 4123$. Let's try another order.)\n*   Let's try small primes systematically:\n    *   $53599 / 7 = 7657$\n    *   $53599 / 11 = 4872.6...$\n    *   $53599 / 13 = 4123$\n    *   $53599 / 17 = 3152.8...$\n    *   $53599 / 19 = 2821$\n*   So, $d = 19 \\times 2821$. Now we factor 2821.\n    *   $2821 / 7 = 403$\n*   So, $d = 19 \\times 7 \\times 403$. Now we factor 403.\n    *   $403 / 13 = 31$\n*   The prime factors are 7, 13, 19, and 31.\n    So, the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. This is a square-free integer.\n\n**3. Conditions for a Primitive Character of a Square-Free Conductor**\n\nFor a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$, a character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a **primitive** character modulo the prime $p_i$.\n\nA character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal (trivial) character. The principal character is the unique character of order 1. Therefore, $\\chi_i$ is primitive if and only if its order is greater than 1.\n\n**4. Conditions on the Order**\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ is given by the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$.\n\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6. Let $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We have the following conditions:\n1.  Each $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character modulo $p_i$, which means $k_i > 1$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\nFrom the lcm condition, each $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. So, $k_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\nCombining with the primitivity condition ($k_i > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**5. Counting the Component Characters**\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ in this group is $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check if orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible for each prime factor:\n*   $p_1 = 7$: $\\phi(7) = 6$. Divisors of 6 include 2, 3, 6.\n*   $p_2 = 13$: $\\phi(13) = 12$. Divisors of 12 include 2, 3, 6.\n*   $p_3 = 19$: $\\phi(19) = 18$. Divisors of 18 include 2, 3, 6.\n*   $p_4 = 31$: $\\phi(31) = 30$. Divisors of 30 include 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$, characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist. Let's count them:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nSo, for each of the four prime factors, we can choose a character of order 2 (1 way), order 3 (2 ways), or order 6 (2 ways). The total number of choices for each component character $\\chi_i$ (with order in $\\{2,3,6\\}$) is $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n**6. Combinatorial Counting**\n\nWe need to find the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that their orders $(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)$ are in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and satisfy $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\nWe can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion or complementary counting.\nLet $S$ be the set of all 4-tuples of characters where each $\\chi_i$ has an order from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nThe number of choices for each $\\chi_i$ is 5. Since there are 4 components, the total number of tuples in $S$ is:\n$|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6. Since all orders are divisors of 6, an lcm not equal to 6 must be a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, or 3. As orders are in $\\{2,3,6\\}$, the lcm cannot be 1.\n*   **Case A: The lcm is 2.** This happens if and only if all orders $k_i$ are 2.\n    For each component $\\chi_i$, we must choose a character of order 2. There is $\\phi(2)=1$ way to do this.\n    Number of such tuples = $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n*   **Case B: The lcm is 3.** This happens if and only if all orders $k_i$ are 3.\n    For each component $\\chi_i$, we must choose a character of order 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ ways to do this.\n    Number of such tuples = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe set of tuples where the lcm is 2 and the set where the lcm is 3 are disjoint.\nThe number of tuples where the lcm is 6 is the total number of tuples in $S$ minus those where the lcm is 2 or 3.\nNumber of characters = $|S| - (\\text{Number for lcm=2}) - (\\text{Number for lcm=3})$\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$ is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
