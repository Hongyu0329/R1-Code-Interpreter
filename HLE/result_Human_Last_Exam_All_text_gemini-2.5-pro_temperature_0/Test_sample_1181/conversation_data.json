    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key identifying detail is a very specific feeling and memory: the character is \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This implies not just homesickness, but a sense of guilt or weakness associated with that feeling.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and their Motivations**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins and ends with him on Earth, surrounded by nature. He clearly has a deep connection to Earth and misses it profoundly. However, his primary emotional struggle revolves around the reappearance of his dead wife, Hari, and the guilt he feels over her suicide. While he is homesick, the specific sentiment of being *ashamed* of it is more characteristic of another character.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories of his deceased wife, created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. She has no independent memories of Earth and therefore cannot miss it. Her journey is one of discovering her own identity, separate from Kris's memory of her.\n*   **C. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is cynical, world-weary, and has been on the station for a long time. He often engages in long, philosophical monologues about the nature of humanity, science, and their predicament. He represents the psychological toll of long-term isolation and contact with the alien.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist. He is rigid, cold, and obsessed with a purely scientific approach to Solaris. He views the \"guests\" as a phenomenon to be studied and controlled, showing contempt for the emotional turmoil they cause. It is highly unlikely that he would admit to, let alone feel ashamed of, a sentimental feeling like homesickness.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A friend of Kris's who was the third scientist on the station. He commits suicide just before Kris arrives. We see him only in a video recording he left for Kris. In the video, he is in a state of extreme distress and despair, warning Kris about the station, but he does not express this specific feeling of shame about missing Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThe line in question is spoken during a conversation in the station's library. Snaut, in a moment of drunken, philosophical candor, reveals his inner state to Kris. He explains his weariness and disillusionment with their mission. He confesses that when he feels down, he looks at engravings by the artist DÃ¼rer, but this only makes him feel \"ashamed.\" He then clarifies why: he is ashamed to be thinking of something as simple and earthly as \"the rustling of leaves\" when he is supposed to be a pioneer of the cosmos, engaged in a grand scientific and intellectual endeavor. This feeling of shame stems from his belief that he should be above such \"primitive\" longings.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the character analysis and the specific dialogue from the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Snaut. His confession perfectly encapsulates his character's conflict between his role as a scientist and his fundamental, undeniable humanity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
