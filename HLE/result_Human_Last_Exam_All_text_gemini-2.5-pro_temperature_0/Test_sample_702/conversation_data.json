    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $\\Phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map\n\nLet's denote the source space as $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space as $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The target space can be identified as $B \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$, since $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\n\nThe map $\\Phi: A \\to B$ is a natural map arising in homotopy theory, often related to Samelson products and James-Hopf invariants. To analyze its connectivity, it is convenient to study its adjoint map. The suspension-loop space adjunction gives a correspondence between maps $\\Sigma X \\to Y$ and maps $X \\to \\Omega Y$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{\\Phi}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))$ be the adjoint of $\\Phi$.\nSo, $\\tilde{\\Phi}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\nThe connectivity of a map is the same as the connectivity of its adjoint. Therefore, we will determine the connectivity of $\\tilde{\\Phi}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the connectivity of the source and target spaces of the adjoint map\n\nLet the source of $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ be $A' = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ and the target be $B' = \\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\n\n**Source Space ($A'$):**\n1.  The loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n2.  If a space $X$ is $k$-connected and a space $Y$ is $l$-connected, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(k+l+1)$-connected.\n    *   $A' = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected. This means $\\pi_i(A') = 0$ for $i \\le 7$.\n3.  The first non-trivial homotopy group of $A'$ is $\\pi_8(A')$. By the Hurewicz theorem and Künneth formula for homology (since the homology of the loop spaces is torsion-free), this group is isomorphic to the tensor product of the first non-trivial homotopy groups of the factors.\n    *   $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_8(A') = \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Target Space ($B'$):**\n1.  The iterated loop space $\\Omega^k S^n$ is $(n-k-1)$-connected.\n    *   $B' = \\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is $(10-2-1)=7$-connected. This means $\\pi_i(B') = 0$ for $i \\le 7$.\n2.  The first non-trivial homotopy group of $B'$ is $\\pi_8(B')$.\n    *   $\\pi_8(B') = \\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{8+2}(S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the map $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ on the lowest non-trivial homotopy group\n\nThe map $\\tilde{\\Phi}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is at least 7-connected since both the source and target are 7-connected. To determine the precise connectivity, we must analyze the induced homomorphism on the first non-trivial homotopy group, $\\pi_8$.\n\n$\\tilde{\\Phi}_*: \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10})$\n$\\tilde{\\Phi}_*: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe map $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ is deeply related to the Whitehead product. The generator of $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ can be represented by the smash product of the adjoints of the identity maps on $S^4$ and $S^6$. The map $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ sends this generator to the element in $\\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10})$ corresponding to the double suspension of the Whitehead product $[\\text{id}_{S^4}, \\text{id}_{S^6}]$.\n\nA standard result in homotopy theory states that this map is an isomorphism. Specifically:\n1.  The Samelson product gives a map $k: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega S^9$ which is an isomorphism on $\\pi_8$.\n2.  The map $j: \\Omega S^9 \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is adjoint to the suspension map $E: S^9 \\to \\Omega S^{10}$. The suspension homomorphism $E_*: \\pi_9(S^9) \\to \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10})$ is an isomorphism. By adjunction, $j_*: \\pi_8(\\Omega S^9) \\to \\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10})$ is also an isomorphism.\n3.  The map $\\tilde{\\Phi}_*$ on $\\pi_8$ can be identified with the composition of these two isomorphisms, and is therefore itself an isomorphism.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the connectivity of the map\n\nA map $f: X \\to Y$ is $n$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups $f_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(Y)$ is an isomorphism for all $k < n$ and a surjection for $k=n$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(n-1)$-connected.\n\nLet's check the connectivity of $\\tilde{\\Phi}$.\n*   For $k < 8$, $\\pi_k(A') = 0$ and $\\pi_k(B') = 0$, so $\\tilde{\\Phi}_*$ is an isomorphism.\n*   For $k = 8$, we found that $\\tilde{\\Phi}_*: \\pi_8(A') \\to \\pi_8(B')$ is an isomorphism ($\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$). An isomorphism is a surjection.\n*   Therefore, the map $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ is at least 8-connected.\n\nTo check if it is 9-connected, we must check if $\\tilde{\\Phi}_*$ is an isomorphism for $k<9$ (which it is) and a surjection for $k=9$.\n*   $\\pi_9(\\text{source}) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Using the Künneth formula for homology, $H_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)=0$, which implies $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)=0$.\n*   $\\pi_9(\\text{target}) = \\pi_9(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. From tables of homotopy groups of spheres, $\\pi_{11}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The map $\\tilde{\\Phi}_*: \\pi_9(A') \\to \\pi_9(B')$ is a map from $0$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. This map is not surjective.\n\nSince the map on $\\pi_9$ is not surjective, the map $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ is not 9-connected.\nThe connectivity of $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ is therefore 8.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe connectivity of the original map $\\Phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is the same as the connectivity of its adjoint map $\\tilde{\\Phi}$. Since we found that $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ is 8-connected, the map $\\Phi$ is also 8-connected.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Correctly identifying the map and its adjoint.\n*   Correctly calculating the connectivity of the source and target spaces. This involves knowing the connectivity of loop spaces and smash products.\n*   Using the correct homotopy groups of spheres ($\\pi_{10}(S^{10})=\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\pi_{11}(S^{10})=\\mathbb{Z}_2$).\n*   Knowing the fundamental result that the map on the lowest non-trivial homotopy group is an isomorphism related to the Whitehead product.\n*   Applying the definition of an n-connected map correctly.\n\nFinal Answer: The map is 8-connected.\n\n>>>8"
