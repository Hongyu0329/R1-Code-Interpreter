The pharmacist should counsel Allison on the drug interaction between Fluoxetine and the aspirin in Excedrin. Taking an SSRI (Fluoxetine) with an NSAID (aspirin) significantly increases the risk of bleeding, especially stomach bleeding. The pharmacist could recommend that for future headaches, she consider using a product with only acetaminophen (like Tylenol) to avoid this interaction. They might also inquire if the headaches are a new side effect, as they can be caused by both Fluoxetine and Junel Fe.
