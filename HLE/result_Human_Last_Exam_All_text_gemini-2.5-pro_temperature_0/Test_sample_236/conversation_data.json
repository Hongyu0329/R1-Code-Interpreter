    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant knots and surgeries\n\nFirst, we need to identify all the knots with a crossing number of four or less. Then, we must determine which integral surgeries on these knots produce homology 3-spheres.\n\n1.  **Knots with at most four crossings:**\n    *   **0 crossings:** The unknot ($0_1$).\n    *   **1, 2 crossings:** There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n    *   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil (denoted $3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (denoted $-3_1$).\n    *   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n2.  **Integral surgery producing homology spheres:**\n    An integral surgery on a knot $K$ in $S^3$ is denoted by $S^3_n(K)$, where $n$ is an integer framing. The first homology group of the resulting manifold is $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$. For $S^3_n(K)$ to be a homology 3-sphere, its first homology group must be trivial, which requires $|n|=1$.\n    Therefore, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries on the knots listed above.\n\n### Step 2: List the resulting homology spheres\n\nLet's generate the list of all homology spheres obtained from these surgeries.\n\n*   **Unknot ($0_1$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    This gives one manifold: the 3-sphere $S^3$, which is the identity element in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n*   **Right-handed Trefoil ($3_1$):**\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$: This is the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: This is the Poincar√© homology sphere, $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n\n*   **Left-handed Trefoil ($-3_1$):**\n    We use the identity $S^3_n(-K) = -S^3_{-n}(K)$, where $-Y$ denotes the manifold $Y$ with the opposite orientation.\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1) = -S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1) = -S^3_{+1}(3_1) = -\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n\n*   **Figure-eight knot ($4_1$):**\n    This knot is amphichiral, so $4_1 = -4_1$.\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: A specific hyperbolic homology sphere.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1) = -S^3_{+1}(-4_1) = -S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. This is the oppositely oriented version of the manifold from +1 surgery.\n\nSo, the complete set of homology spheres generated is:\n$\\{ S^3, \\Sigma(2,3,7), \\Sigma(2,3,5), -\\Sigma(2,3,5), -\\Sigma(2,3,7), S^3_{+1}(4_1), -S^3_{+1}(4_1) \\}$\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group ($\\Theta_3^H$)\n\nNow we must determine how many of these seven manifolds represent distinct elements in $\\Theta_3^H$. Two homology spheres $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ represent the same element if they are homology cobordant. We use homology cobordism invariants to distinguish them. The primary invariants are the Rokhlin invariant ($\\mu$), the Casson invariant ($\\lambda$), and the Heegaard Floer correction terms ($d$).\n\n1.  **Careful Point:** An element $Y \\in \\Theta_3^H$ is distinct from its inverse $-Y$ unless $Y$ has order 2 (i.e., $Y \\# Y$ is homology cobordant to $S^3$). A necessary condition for $Y$ to have order 2 is that its Rokhlin invariant $\\mu(Y)$ must be 0. A stronger condition is that its $d$-invariant must be 0.\n\nLet's compute the invariants for our list of non-trivial spheres:\n\n| Manifold ($Y$) | Knot Surgery | $\\mu(Y)$ | $d(Y)$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ | $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$ | 1 | -2 |\n| $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ | $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$ | 1 | 2 |\n| $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ | $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$ | 1 | -2 |\n| $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ | $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$ | 1 | 2 |\n| $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ | $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ | 0 | -2 |\n| $-S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ | $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ | 0 | 2 |\n\n*   **$S^3$** is the identity element, with all invariants 0. It is unique.\n*   None of the other six manifolds have a $d$-invariant of 0, so none of them are order 2. This means each of them is distinct from its inverse. For example, $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ is distinct from $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n*   We can distinguish many elements using the pair of invariants $(\\mu, d)$:\n    *   $S^3$: $(\\mu=0, d=0)$\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: $(\\mu=0, d=-2)$\n    *   $-S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: $(\\mu=0, d=2)$\n    These three are distinct from each other and all others.\n*   This leaves us with two pairs of manifolds that have identical $(\\mu, d)$ invariants:\n    1.  $\\{\\Sigma(2,3,7), -\\Sigma(2,3,5)\\}$, both with $(\\mu=1, d=-2)$.\n    2.  $\\{\\Sigma(2,3,5), -\\Sigma(2,3,7)\\}$, both with $(\\mu=1, d=2)$.\n\n2.  **Careful Point:** We need a stronger tool to distinguish elements with the same known invariants. For surgeries on knots, there is a powerful criterion:\n    *   $S^3_{\\epsilon}(K_1)$ is homology cobordant to $S^3_{\\epsilon}(K_2)$ (for $\\epsilon = \\pm 1$) if and only if the knot $K_1 \\# -K_2$ is slice in a homology 4-ball (H-slice).\n    *   A necessary condition for a knot to be H-slice is that its signature, $\\sigma(K)$, must be zero.\n\n*   **Case 1:** Is $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ homology cobordant to $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$?\n    *   $\\Sigma(2,3,7) = S^3_{+1}(3_1)$ and $-\\Sigma(2,3,5) = S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$.\n    *   Here, $\\epsilon=+1$, $K_1=3_1$, and $K_2=-3_1$.\n    *   We test the knot $K_1 \\# -K_2 = 3_1 \\# -(-3_1) = 3_1 \\# 3_1$ (the square knot).\n    *   The signature is additive under connected sum: $\\sigma(3_1 \\# 3_1) = \\sigma(3_1) + \\sigma(3_1) = -2 + (-2) = -4$.\n    *   Since the signature is $-4 \\neq 0$, the square knot is not H-slice.\n    *   Therefore, $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ and $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ are **distinct** elements.\n\n*   **Case 2:** Is $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ homology cobordant to $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$?\n    *   $\\Sigma(2,3,5) = S^3_{-1}(3_1)$ and $-\\Sigma(2,3,7) = S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$.\n    *   Here, $\\epsilon=-1$, $K_1=3_1$, and $K_2=-3_1$.\n    *   We again test the knot $3_1 \\# -(-3_1) = 3_1 \\# 3_1$.\n    *   As before, its signature is -4, so it is not H-slice.\n    *   Therefore, $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ and $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ are **distinct** elements.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nAll seven manifolds in our list represent distinct elements in the homology cobordism group. Let's list them one last time:\n1.  $S^3$ (the identity)\n2.  $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$\n3.  $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$\n4.  $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$\n5.  $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$\n6.  $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$\n7.  $-S^3_{+1}(4_1)$\n\nThe total number of distinct elements is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
