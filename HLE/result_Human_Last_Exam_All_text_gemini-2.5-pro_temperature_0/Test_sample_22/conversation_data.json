    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the key concepts.**\n\n*   **Phenotype:** A measurable trait of an individual, such as height, blood pressure, or risk for a disease.\n*   **SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism):** A common type of genetic variation among people.\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter that quantifies the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of all common SNPs considered together. It represents the *theoretical maximum* predictive power that could ever be achieved using a linear model of these SNPs. It's the amount of \"signal\" available in the SNPs. It is often estimated using methods like GREML on a single large dataset.\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS) or Polygenic Risk Score (PRS):** This is a practical tool, a single number calculated for an individual that summarizes their estimated genetic predisposition for a phenotype. It is built by taking an individual's genotype at many SNPs and weighting them by effect sizes that are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This measures how well the PGS can predict the phenotype in a *new, independent sample* (a \"test\" or \"validation\" set) that was not used to estimate the SNP effect sizes. This is typically measured by R², which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain in this new sample.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability.**\n\n1.  **Ceiling vs. Actual Performance:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the theoretical ceiling of predictability. It's the variance that would be explained if we knew the *true* effect size of every single SNP and used them to build a perfect predictor.\n2.  **Estimation from Finite Data:** A PGS is not built with true effect sizes. It is built with *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS. Because any GWAS has a finite sample size, these estimates are not perfect; they contain statistical noise and error.\n3.  **Impact of Estimation Error:** This error in the estimated effect sizes means that the resulting PGS is an imperfect proxy for the true underlying genetic value. When this imperfect predictor is applied to a new sample, its predictive ability (R²) will be lower than the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP). This phenomenon is known as attenuation. The smaller the GWAS used to build the PGS, the larger the estimation error, and the lower the predictive R² will be.\n4.  **Other Limiting Factors:** Besides the finite sample size of the GWAS, other factors also ensure the PGS predictive ability is lower than SNP heritability. These include:\n    *   Imperfect modeling of linkage disequilibrium (the correlation structure between SNPs).\n    *   Potential mismatches in ancestry between the GWAS sample and the test sample.\n    *   The possibility that the true causal variants are not perfectly tagged by the SNPs on the genotyping chip.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the word \"necessarily\".**\n\nThe statement claims the predictive ability is *necessarily* lower. This implies there are no exceptions.\n\n*   **Practical Reality:** In any real-world scenario, a PGS is built from a finite GWAS sample. Therefore, it will always have estimation errors, and its predictive R² will be strictly lower than the SNP heritability.\n*   **Theoretical Limit:** One could imagine a hypothetical scenario with an infinitely large GWAS sample. In this theoretical limit, the estimated effect sizes would converge to the true effect sizes. The resulting \"perfect\" PGS would then have a predictive ability (R²) that is *equal to* the SNP heritability (h²_SNP).\n*   **Interpretation:** However, the term \"polygenic score\" inherently refers to a practical construct based on estimated effects. The theoretical, perfect score is a different concept. The question is about the predictive ability of a polygenic score, which is a real-world tool. For any such tool, the limitations described above apply. Therefore, its predictive power is necessarily attenuated compared to the theoretical maximum.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe SNP heritability sets the upper bound for prediction. A polygenic score is an attempt to reach that bound. Due to the inherent imperfections in estimating the genetic effects from finite data, any practically constructed polygenic score will explain less variance than this theoretical upper bound. Therefore, its predictive ability is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
