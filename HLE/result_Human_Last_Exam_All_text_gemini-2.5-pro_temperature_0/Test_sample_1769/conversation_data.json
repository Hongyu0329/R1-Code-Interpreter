    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Starting Point - The Current Word \"Sister\"\n\nThe modern English word is \"sister\". To understand what it *would* be, we must first understand what it *is*. The word \"sister\" has a complex origin story involving both Old English (the language of the Anglo-Saxons) and Old Norse (the language of the Vikings).\n\n*   **Old English:** The native Anglo-Saxon word was ***sweostor*** (with variants like *swuster*).\n*   **Old Norse:** The word brought by Viking invaders was ***systir***.\n\nThese two words are cognates, meaning they both descend from the same ancient root, the Proto-Germanic word **swestr-*. Because they were so similar in sound and meaning, they interacted heavily in the areas where both languages were spoken (the Danelaw). The modern word \"sister\" is essentially a hybrid. It retains the `s-` and `-ster` from the Old English *sweostor*, but its internal vowel sound (`-i-`) and the hard /s/ sound (instead of a softer /sh/ or /sw/ sound) are heavily influenced by the Old Norse *systir*.\n\n### Step 2: Remove the Norse Influence\n\nThe question asks us to imagine a history where the Norse never invaded or interacted with the Anglo-Saxons. In this alternate timeline, the Old Norse word *systir* would never have been introduced to England. Therefore, the evolution of the word would depend entirely on the native Old English word, *sweostor*.\n\n### Step 3: Trace the Hypothetical Evolution of \"Sweostor\"\n\nWe need to apply the known rules of English language sound change to the word *sweostor* to see how it would likely have evolved into Modern English on its own.\n\n1.  **Old English to Middle English:** The Old English word was *sweostor*. During the transition to Middle English, unstressed vowels were often weakened or dropped. The unstressed `o` in the middle of *sweostor* would likely have been lost. This would lead to a Middle English form like ***swester*** or ***swuster***. Both of these forms are actually attested in historical texts, representing the native English development of the word before the Norse-influenced \"sister\" became dominant.\n\n2.  **Middle English to Modern English:** Now we trace *swuster* forward. A very common sound change in the development of Modern English is the shift of the short 'u' sound (as in \"put\") to the 'uh' sound (as in \"cut\").\n    *   Old English *sunu* became *son*.\n    *   Old English *lufu* became *love*.\n    *   Old English *cuman* became *come*.\n\n    Applying this same rule to ***swuster***, the 'u' sound would change, resulting in the Modern English pronunciation \"suster\" (rhyming with \"buster\").\n\n### Step 4: Look for Supporting Evidence\n\nThis isn't just a theoretical exercise. We can look for clues that support this conclusion.\n\n*   **Dialectal Survival:** The word \"**suster**\" actually survived in various regional dialects of English for centuries, even into the 20th century. This shows that it was the natural, native continuation of the Old English word in areas with less Norse influence.\n*   **Cognates in Other Germanic Languages:** Looking at related languages that did not have the same Old Norse influence on their word for \"sister\" can be helpful. For example, the Dutch word is ***zuster*** and the German word is ***Schwester***. Both of these are much closer to the hypothetical *suster* than to the actual \"sister,\" which further supports this line of evolution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the Old English *sweostor* would have followed its own natural path of development. Through standard sound changes, it would have become *swuster* in Middle English and then, most likely, **suster** in Modern English.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
