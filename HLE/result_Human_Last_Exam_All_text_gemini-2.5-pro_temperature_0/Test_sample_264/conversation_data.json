    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define a Coordinate System and the First Cube**\n\nTo analyze the problem, we first place one of the cubes in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system.\nLet the first cube, C1, have one vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its edges aligned with the coordinate axes. Since the side length is 1, its vertices will have coordinates (x, y, z) where x, y, and z are either 0 or 1.\nThe space occupied by cube C1 can be described by the following inequalities:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Shift and Define the Second Cube**\n\nThe second cube, C2, is identical to C1 but is shifted relative to it. The shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n*   The main diagonal of C1 connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   A shift \"along the main diagonal\" by a value of 1/2 is most naturally interpreted as a displacement vector where each component is 1/2. So, the shift vector is **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n*   Therefore, the second cube, C2, is simply C1 translated by the vector **s**. A point (x', y', z') is in C2 if the point (x' - 1/2, y' - 1/2, z' - 1/2) is in C1.\n*   This means the space occupied by C2 is described by the inequalities:\n    *   0 ≤ x' - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 ≤ y' - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 3/2\n    *   0 ≤ z' - 1/2 ≤ 1  =>  1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 3/2\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape and Dimensions of the Intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for both C1 and C2. We find this by finding the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:**\n    *   From C1: 0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   From C2: 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    *   The intersection of these two intervals is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n    *   The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\n*   **For the y-coordinate:**\n    *   From C1: 0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   From C2: 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    *   The intersection of these two intervals is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n    *   The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\n*   **For the z-coordinate:**\n    *   From C1: 0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n    *   From C2: 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n    *   The intersection of these two intervals is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n    *   The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe resulting intersection is a region defined by 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1. This is a cube with a side length of 1/2.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n\nThe volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\n*   Side length of the intersection cube = 1/2.\n*   Volume = (1/2)³ = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Setting up the Problem:** The choice to place the first cube at the origin with axis-aligned edges is the most critical step for simplifying the calculations.\n2.  **Interpreting the \"Shift\":** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is slightly ambiguous. The interpretation used here, a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), is the most common and leads to a clean, logical result. An alternative interpretation (a shift of distance 1/2 in the direction of the main diagonal) would result in a much more complex calculation and an irrational answer, which is less likely to be the intended problem.\n3.  **Intersection of Intervals:** The intersection of two axis-aligned cubes is another axis-aligned rectangular prism (or cube). Its dimensions are found by finding the intersection of the corresponding intervals for each axis independently. The intersection of two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] is [max(a, c), min(b, d)].\n4.  **Final Volume Calculation:** Once the shape and dimensions of the intersection are known, the volume calculation is straightforward.\n\nThe volume of the intersection is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
