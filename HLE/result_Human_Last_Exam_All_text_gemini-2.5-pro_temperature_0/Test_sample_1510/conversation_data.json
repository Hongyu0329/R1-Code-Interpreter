    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 possible two-dimensional symmetry groups that describe repeating patterns in a plane. They are groups of isometries of the Euclidean plane. Each wallpaper group includes translations in two independent directions.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, its point group is the group of symmetries (rotations and reflections) that leave a specific point fixed. It is obtained by \"factoring out\" the translations. There are 10 possible crystallographic point groups in two dimensions.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements it contains.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find how many of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group containing exactly 2 elements (i.e., an order of 2).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the 2D Crystallographic Point Groups and Their Orders\n\nLet's list the 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups and calculate their orders. The notation $C_n$ represents a cyclic group of order $n$ (generated by a rotation of 360/n degrees), and $D_n$ represents a dihedral group of order $2n$ (symmetries of a regular n-gon).\n\n1.  **$C_1$**: Trivial group (only identity). Order = 1.\n2.  **$C_2$**: Rotation by 180°. Elements: {identity, 180° rotation}. **Order = 2**.\n3.  **$C_3$**: Rotation by 120°. Order = 3.\n4.  **$C_4$**: Rotation by 90°. Order = 4.\n5.  **$C_6$**: Rotation by 60°. Order = 6.\n6.  **$D_1$** (also denoted as $m$ or $C_s$): Reflection across a line. Elements: {identity, one reflection}. **Order = 2**.\n7.  **$D_2$**: Two perpendicular reflection lines. Order = 4.\n8.  **$D_3$**: Symmetries of an equilateral triangle. Order = 6.\n9.  **$D_4$**: Symmetries of a square. Order = 8.\n10. **$D_6$**: Symmetries of a regular hexagon. Order = 12.\n\nFrom this list, the point groups with an order of 2 are **$C_2$** and **$D_1$**.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Wallpaper Groups for Each Relevant Point Group\n\nNow we need to count how many of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to the point groups $C_2$ and $D_1$.\n\n**A. Wallpaper Groups with Point Group $C_2$**\nThe point group $C_2$ consists of only rotational symmetry (a 2-fold, 180° rotation).\n*   There is only **one** wallpaper group whose point group is $C_2$. This group is denoted as **p2**. It has 2-fold rotation centers but no reflection or glide-reflection axes.\n\n**B. Wallpaper Groups with Point Group $D_1$**\nThe point group $D_1$ consists of reflectional symmetry. While the point group itself is simple, it can be realized in the plane in different ways relative to the translation lattice, leading to distinct wallpaper groups.\n*   **pm**: This group has axes of pure reflection (mirror lines). The 'p' stands for a primitive unit cell.\n*   **pg**: This group has axes of glide reflection, but no pure reflection. The 'g' stands for glide.\n*   **cm**: This group has a centered unit cell ('c') and contains both reflection and glide-reflection axes.\n\nThere are **three** wallpaper groups whose point group is $D_1$: **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number\n\nTo find the total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we sum the counts from Step 3.\n\n*   Number of groups with point group $C_2$: 1 (p2)\n*   Number of groups with point group $D_1$: 3 (pm, pg, cm)\n\nTotal = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Distinction between Wallpaper and Point Groups:** The question is about the number of *wallpaper groups*, not point groups. There are only 2 point groups of order 2, but they give rise to 4 distinct wallpaper groups.\n*   **Symmetry Elements in the Plane:** The reason multiple wallpaper groups can share the same point group is the existence of glide reflections and different lattice types (primitive vs. centered). A glide reflection is a combination of a reflection and a translation parallel to the reflection line. From the perspective of a single point (the point group), a glide reflection is just a reflection, but in the context of the entire repeating pattern (the wallpaper group), it is a distinct symmetry operation.\n*   **Standard Notation:** The international (IUC) notations (p2, pm, pg, cm) are used here. Being familiar with this classification is key to answering the question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are p2, pm, pg, and cm. Therefore, there are 4 such groups.\n\n<<<4>>>"
