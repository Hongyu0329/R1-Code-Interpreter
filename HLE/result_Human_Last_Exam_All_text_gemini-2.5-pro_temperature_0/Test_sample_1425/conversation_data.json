    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Grand Canonical Partition Function**\n    The grand canonical partition function, denoted by $\\mathcal{Z}$ (or Z as in the question), for a system is defined as:\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\n    where:\n    *   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n    *   $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator (describing kinetic and potential energies).\n    *   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n    *   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n    *   The trace (Tr) is taken over all states in the Fock space.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Given Hamiltonian**\n    The question provides the Hamiltonian as $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. This is an unusual form. The most direct interpretation is that this is the full operator for the grand canonical ensemble, meaning the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is zero.\n    Let $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N}$ be the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator.\n    With $\\hat{H}_{sys} = 0$, we have $\\hat{K} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$.\n    The partition function is then:\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}} \\right] = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right] = \\text{Tr} \\left[ e^{\\beta \\mu \\hat{N}} \\right]$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Path Integral**\n    The partition function can be written as a functional path integral over fields. For a system of bosons, we use complex scalar fields $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$ and $\\phi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$, which are periodic in imaginary time $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$.\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S_E[\\phi^*, \\phi]}$\n    The Euclidean action $S_E$ is related to the grand canonical Hamiltonian density $\\mathcal{K}$ by:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left( \\phi^* \\partial_\\tau \\phi + \\mathcal{K} \\right)$\n    The particle number operator $\\hat{N}$ is the integral of the number density operator, $\\hat{N} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x}) \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n    Therefore, the grand canonical Hamiltonian density is $\\mathcal{K} = -\\mu \\phi^* \\phi$.\n    Substituting this into the action gives:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left( \\phi^* \\partial_\\tau \\phi - \\mu \\phi^* \\phi \\right) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Gaussian Path Integral**\n    The action is quadratic in the fields, which means the path integral is Gaussian.\n    $S_E = \\int d\\tau d^d x \\, \\phi^* M \\phi$, with the operator $M = \\partial_\\tau - \\mu$.\n    The value of such a Gaussian integral for complex bosonic fields is given by the inverse of the determinant of the operator $M$:\n    $\\mathcal{Z} = [\\det(M)]^{-1}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Determinant**\n    To calculate the determinant, we find the eigenvalues of the operator $M$. We expand the fields in a Fourier basis that respects the periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time ($\\phi(\\beta) = \\phi(0)$).\n    The basis functions are plane waves $e^{i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} - \\omega_n \\tau)}$, where $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies (with $n$ being an integer).\n    The operator $\\partial_\\tau$ acting on these basis functions gives an eigenvalue of $-i\\omega_n$.\n    Thus, the eigenvalues of $M = \\partial_\\tau - \\mu$ are:\n    $\\lambda_{n, \\mathbf{k}} = -i\\omega_n - \\mu$\n    A key point is that these eigenvalues do not depend on the momentum wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$, because the Hamiltonian had no spatial dependence (no kinetic term like $\\nabla^2$).\n    The determinant is the product of all eigenvalues over all modes (both Matsubara frequencies $n$ and momentum modes $\\mathbf{k}$):\n    $\\det(M) = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} \\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n\n6.  **Use the Standard Result for the Determinant**\n    The product over Matsubara frequencies, $\\prod_n (-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$, is formally divergent but has a well-defined regularized value in quantum field theory. For a bosonic operator of the form $\\partial_\\tau + E$ with periodic boundary conditions, the result is:\n    $\\det(\\partial_\\tau + E) \\propto 1 - e^{-\\beta E}$\n    In our case, the operator is $M = \\partial_\\tau - \\mu$, which corresponds to setting $E = -\\mu$.\n    So, for a single momentum mode $\\mathbf{k}$, the determinant is:\n    $\\det(M_{\\mathbf{k}}) = \\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\propto 1 - e^{-\\beta(-\\mu)} = 1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n\n7.  **Assemble the Final Partition Function**\n    The partition function for a single mode is the inverse of this determinant:\n    $\\mathcal{Z}_{\\text{mode}} = [\\det(M_{\\mathbf{k}})]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\n    (The proportionality constant is absorbed into the normalization of the path integral measure).\n    This result is the well-known partition function for a single bosonic state that can be occupied by any number of particles, calculated via a direct trace: $\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (e^{\\beta\\mu})^n = \\frac{1}{1-e^{\\beta\\mu}}$. This series converges for $e^{\\beta\\mu} < 1$, which implies $\\mu < 0$.\n\n    Since the problem does not specify the number of modes (e.g., the volume of the system or its dimensionality), the most fundamental answer is the partition function for a single such mode. If the system contained $M$ independent, identical modes, the total partition function would be $(\\mathcal{Z}_{\\text{mode}})^M$. Without further information, we provide the result for one mode.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$ in the grand canonical ensemble is the partition function for a single bosonic mode with occupancy determined by the chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\n$Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta \\mu}}$\n\nThis result is valid under the condition that the chemical potential is negative ($\\mu < 0$) to ensure the convergence of the state sum.\n\n<<<1 / (1 - exp(beta * mu))>>>"
