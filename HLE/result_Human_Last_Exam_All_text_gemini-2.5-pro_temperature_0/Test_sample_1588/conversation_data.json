    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting elements of a Lie algebra. The formula is an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$:\n$Z = X + Y + Z_2(X,Y) + Z_3(X,Y) + \\dots + Z_n(X,Y) + \\dots$\nwhere $Z_n(X,Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of total degree $n$ in $X$ and $Y$. For example:\n$Z_2(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n$Z_3(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [X, Y]]$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Question to the Structure of the BCH Expansion**\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This means we need to find how many linearly independent terms (nested commutators) exist at degree 10. The terms $Z_n(X,Y)$ are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, $X$ and $Y$. The number of linearly independent terms of degree $n$ is precisely the dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree $n$ of this free Lie algebra. The coefficients in the BCH formula for these basis elements are given by Dynkin's formula and are, in general, non-zero rational numbers. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients is equal to the dimension of this subspace.\n\n**Step 3: Use Witt's Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree $n$ of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n$$ \\dim L_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d} $$\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the degree (order).\n*   $k$ is the number of generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive integers $d$ that divide $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Parameters for Our Problem**\n\n*   We are interested in the terms of **order 10**, so $n = 10$.\n*   The BCH expansion involves two generators, **X and Y**, so $k = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Witt's Formula**\n\nWe need to calculate $\\dim L_{10}(2)$.\n\n*   **Find the divisors of n = 10:** The positive divisors of 10 are $d = 1, 2, 5, 10$.\n\n*   **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$ (by definition).\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a single prime).\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a single prime).\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\times 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is the product of 2 distinct primes).\n\n*   **Calculate each term in the summation $\\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$:**\n    *   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$.\n    *   For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = (-1) \\cdot 2^5 = -32$.\n    *   For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = (-1) \\cdot 2^2 = -4$.\n    *   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Sum the terms:**\n    Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$.\n\n*   **Complete the calculation for $\\dim L_{10}(2)$:**\n    $\\dim L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times (\\text{Sum}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Interpretation:** The key is to understand that \"number of nonzero coefficients\" corresponds to the number of linearly independent basis elements of the free Lie algebra at that degree.\n2.  **Correct Formula:** Witt's formula is the correct tool for this problem.\n3.  **Möbius Function:** Be careful when calculating the Möbius function, especially for non-prime numbers. $\\mu(d)$ is 0 if $d$ has a squared prime factor, -1 for an odd number of distinct prime factors, and +1 for an even number of distinct prime factors.\n4.  **Calculation Accuracy:** Ensure all parts of the formula (divisors, powers, summation, and final division) are calculated correctly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the degree-10 subspace of the free Lie algebra on two generators, which is calculated to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
