    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression to find the value of `n` and then `log_2(n)`.\n\n**The Expression:**\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\n**Step 1: Decompose the expression and identify key combinators.**\n\nLet's assign aliases to the parts of the expression to make it more readable.\n\n*   Let `TWO = S(I)`.\n*   Let `M = S(S(K(S))(K))`.\n*   Let `I_num = I`. In the context of Church numerals, `I` represents the number 1.\n*   Let `ω = S(I)(I)`.\n*   Let `A = K(M(I_num))`.\n*   Let `B = M(ω)`.\n\nWith these aliases, the expression can be written as:\n`n = TWO(TWO(TWO(A)(B)))`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the `TWO` combinator.**\n\nThe `TWO` combinator is `S(I)`. Let's see how it behaves when applied to a function `f` and an argument `x`.\n`TWO f x = S(I) f x = I f (f x) = f(f x)`\nThis is the definition of the Church numeral for the number 2. It applies a function `f` to an argument `x` twice.\nSo, `TWO` is the Church numeral **2**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure `TWO(TWO(TWO(A)(B)))`.**\n\nThis is a nested application of the Church numeral 2.\n*   `TWO(A)(B)` means applying the numeral 2 to the function `A` and the argument `B`. This evaluates to `A(A(B))`.\n*   The expression becomes `n = TWO(TWO(A(A(B))))`.\n*   Let `C = A(A(B))`. The expression is `n = TWO(TWO(C))`.\n*   `TWO(C)` evaluates to `C(C)`.\n*   The expression becomes `n = TWO(C(C))`.\n*   This evaluates to `(C(C))(C(C))`.\nThis interpretation is complex. Let's use function composition, which is more natural for Church numerals. `m(n)` is equivalent to multiplication `m*n`.\n*   `TWO(TWO) = 2(2) = 2 * 2 = 4`.\n*   `TWO(4) = 2(4) = 2 * 4 = 8`.\n*   So `TWO(TWO(TWO(...)))` is not quite right.\n\nLet's go back to the direct application:\n`n = TWO(TWO(TWO(A)(B)))`\nLet's evaluate from the inside out.\n1.  `X = TWO(A)(B) = A(A(B))`\n2.  `Y = TWO(X) = X(X)`\n3.  `n = TWO(Y) = Y(Y) = (X(X))(X(X)) = X^4` (in terms of composition)\n\nSo, `n = (A(A(B)))^4`. This means `n` is the result of composing the combinator `A(A(B))` with itself four times.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combinator `A`.**\n\n`A = K(M(I_num))`\n*   `K` is the constant combinator: `K x y = x`.\n*   `M = S(S(K S)K)`. Let's determine what `M` does.\n    *   `B = S(K S)K` is the composition combinator: `B f g x = f(g x)`.\n    *   `M = S(B)`.\n    *   `M m n f = S(B) m n f = B m (n m) f`. This is not the standard argument order.\n    *   Let's reduce `M` directly with arguments `m, n, f`:\n        `M m n f = S(S(K S)K) m n f = (S(K S)K m) n f = (S(K m)) n f = (K m f)(n f) = m(n f)`.\n    *   The expression `λm.λn.λf. m(n f)` is the definition of multiplication (`MUL`) for Church numerals. So, `M = MUL`.\n*   Now we can evaluate `A = K(MUL(I_num))`.\n    *   `I_num` is the Church numeral 1.\n    *   `MUL(I_num)` is `MUL(1)`. The multiplication-by-one function is the identity function. `MUL(1)(n) = n`.\n    *   So, `MUL(I_num)` is equivalent to the identity combinator `I`.\n    *   Therefore, `A = K(I)`.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate `n = (A(A(B)))^4`.**\n\nNow that we know `A = K(I)`, we can evaluate the base of the power.\n*   `A(B) = K(I)(B)`. By the definition of `K`, this evaluates to the first argument, `I`. The combinator `B` is irrelevant.\n    `A(B) = I`.\n*   Now substitute this back: `A(A(B)) = A(I)`.\n*   `A(I) = K(I)(I)`. Again, by the definition of `K`, this evaluates to `I`.\n    `A(I) = I`.\n*   So, the base of the power is `I`: `A(A(B)) = I`.\n\nNow, we can find `n`:\n`n = (I)^4 = I o I o I o I = I`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation.**\n\nThe entire complex expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))` reduces to the identity combinator `I`.\nIn Church numeral encoding, `I` represents the integer **1**.\nSo, `n = 1`.\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(1) = 0`."
