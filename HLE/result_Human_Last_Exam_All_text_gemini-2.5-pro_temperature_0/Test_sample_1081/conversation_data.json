    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Question:**\n    The question asks for the \"exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\" of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. In the theory of algebraic groups, this is standardly interpreted as finding the number of **$G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes** of maximal tori that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A maximal torus $T$ is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ if it is stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$.\n\n2.  **The General Classification Theorem:**\n    There is a fundamental result that connects the classification of rational maximal tori to the structure of the Weyl group.\n    **Theorem:** Let $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism. The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is in a natural one-to-one correspondence with the set of **$F$-conjugacy classes** in the absolute Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n3.  **Defining $F$-conjugacy:**\n    An $F$-conjugacy class in the Weyl group $W$ is an orbit of the action of $W$ on itself defined by $w \\mapsto x \\cdot w \\cdot F(x)^{-1}$ for $x, w \\in W$. Here, $F(x)$ denotes the image of $x$ under the automorphism of $W$ induced by the Frobenius endomorphism of the group $G$. The number of such classes is the size of the first cohomology set $H^1(\\langle F \\rangle, W)$.\n\n4.  **Determining the Form of the Group $G$:**\n    The structure of $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (i.e., its \"form\") determines the action of $F$ on the Weyl group $W$. The forms of a given split group are classified by Galois cohomology.\n    *   For a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial symmetries. This means the group of outer automorphisms is trivial.\n    *   Consequently, all automorphisms of the split group of type $E_8$ are inner. This means that any group of type $E_8$ over any field is an \"inner form\" of the split group.\n    *   Over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, Lang's theorem implies that the first Galois cohomology group $H^1(\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}/\\mathbb{F}_q), H)$ is trivial for any connected algebraic group $H$.\n    *   Applying this to the adjoint group of type $E_8$, we find that all inner forms are trivial.\n    *   Therefore, any reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be the **split group**.\n\n5.  **Determining the Action of Frobenius on the Weyl Group:**\n    Since $G$ is the split group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the root system and, consequently, on the Weyl group $W$. This means that for any element $w \\in W$, we have $F(w) = w$.\n\n6.  **Simplifying the Counting Problem:**\n    With the Frobenius action being trivial ($F(w)=w$), the $F$-conjugacy relation simplifies:\n    $x \\cdot w \\cdot F(x)^{-1} = x \\cdot w \\cdot x^{-1}$.\n    This is precisely the ordinary conjugacy relation in the group $W$.\n    Therefore, the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in $W$ is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in $W$.\n\n7.  **Finding the Number of Conjugacy Classes in $W(E_8)$:**\n    The problem is now reduced to a purely combinatorial question: What is the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$?\n    *   $W(E_8)$ is a finite Coxeter group of order $696,729,600$.\n    *   The number of its conjugacy classes is a known result in the mathematical literature on reflection groups. This number was computed by mathematicians like J.S. Frame and R.W. Carter.\n    *   The number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ is **112**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpretation of the question:** The key is to correctly interpret the question as asking for the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes, which is the standard approach that yields a finite, $q$-independent answer.\n*   **Form of the group:** It is crucial to establish that any group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split. This relies on the specific properties of the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram (no symmetries) and the general result of Lang's theorem for finite fields.\n*   **Action of Frobenius:** For a split group, the Frobenius action on the Weyl group is trivial. This is the central simplification. If the group were a twisted form (which is not possible for $E_8$), the action would be non-trivial, and the calculation would be different.\n*   **Final Combinatorial Result:** The final answer depends on the known number of conjugacy classes of the specific Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy, is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This number is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
