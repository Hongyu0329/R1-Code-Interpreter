    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\"\n\nFirst, we must establish a clear definition of a \"historical saint\" for the purpose of this question. In the context of Milton's work, a 17th-century Protestant epic, this term should be interpreted broadly.\n\n*   **Historical:** The figure must be a person believed to have actually lived, not a purely allegorical or mythological character (e.g., excluding Greek gods mentioned in similes).\n*   **Saint:** This is the more complex term. Milton, as a radical Protestant, rejected the Catholic process of canonization. For him, a \"saint\" (from the Greek *hagios*, \"holy one\") was any true believer. For our analysis, we will include:\n    1.  Major revered figures from the Old Testament (patriarchs, prophets, righteous kings).\n    2.  Key figures from the New Testament recognized for their holiness (e.g., Mary, the Apostles).\n    3.  Post-biblical figures who have been formally canonized as saints by Christian churches (like the Catholic Church), even if Milton mentions them critically.\n\nWe will exclude divine beings (God the Father, the Son) and angels (Michael, Raphael, Gabriel), as they are not \"historical\" in the same sense as human figures.\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Search of *Paradise Lost*\n\nThe most effective method is to go through the poem book by book, identifying every named historical person who fits our definition. The majority of these names appear in Books III, XI, and XII, where Milton deals with salvation history.\n\n### Step 3: Listing and Verifying Each Mentioned Saint\n\nWe will list each potential candidate and the location of their mention in the text.\n\n**Old Testament Saints:**\n\n1.  **Moses:** Mentioned first in a simile (Book I, line 306) and later as the leader of the Israelites (Book XII, lines 170-244).\n2.  **Abraham:** Mentioned as the patriarch of the faithful (Book III, line 433) and his story is recounted by Michael (Book XII, lines 113-151).\n3.  **David:** Mentioned as the ancestor from whose throne the Messiah will rule (Book III, line 441) and as a great king of Israel (Book XII, line 321).\n4.  **Adam:** A central character throughout the poem. As the first man, he is considered a \"Holy Forefather\" and saint in some Christian traditions.\n5.  **Eve:** A central character. Like Adam, she is considered a \"Holy Fore-mother\" and saint in some traditions.\n6.  **Abel:** His story as the first martyr is shown to Adam in a vision (Book XI, lines 429-460).\n7.  **Enoch:** Mentioned as the righteous man who was taken by God before the Flood (Book XI, lines 664-709).\n8.  **Noah:** Mentioned as the \"one just man\" who builds the ark and survives the Flood (Book XI, lines 719-840).\n9.  **Shem:** Named as one of Noah's righteous sons (Book XI, line 891).\n10. **Japhet:** Named as another of Noah's righteous sons (Book XI, line 891). (Note: Ham is also named but is the progenitor of a cursed line, making his status as a \"saint\" highly questionable).\n11. **Isaac:** Named as the son of Abraham (Book XII, line 153).\n12. **Jacob:** Named as the father of the twelve tribes of Israel (Book XII, line 153).\n13. **Joseph:** Named as the son of Jacob who brought the Israelites to Egypt (Book XII, line 162).\n14. **Aaron:** Named as the brother of Moses and the first high priest (Book XII, line 170).\n15. **Joshua:** Named as the successor to Moses who led the Israelites into the promised land (Book XII, line 263).\n16. **Solomon:** Named as the son of David who built the Temple but later fell into idolatry (Book XII, line 331). Despite his flaws, he is a major figure in salvation history and thus included.\n\n**New Testament Saints:**\n\n17. **Mary:** Explicitly named as the mother of the Messiah: \"a Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire / The Power of the most High; he shall be called / The Son of God, and raise his Throne above / His Father David's Throne, and reign for ever. / Her name is Mary...\" (Book XII, lines 368-372).\n18. **Peter:** Mentioned by name in the satirical description of the Limbo of Vanity, where a deluded soul is mistaken for him (Book III, line 489). Although the context is critical of the Papacy (\"Peter's chair\"), the Apostle himself is named.\n\n**Post-Biblical Saints:**\n\n19. **Dominic:** Named in the Limbo of Vanity section, where Milton satirizes those who hope to enter heaven by wearing the robes of the Dominican order (Book III, line 479).\n20. **Francis:** Named alongside Dominic in the same satirical passage, mocking the Franciscan order (Book III, line 480).\n\n### Step 4: Careful Points and Exclusions\n\n*   **John the Baptist:** He is clearly described as the \"great Proclaimer\" (Book XII, line 438), but he is not mentioned by the name \"John.\" Therefore, he is excluded.\n*   **The Apostles (other than Peter):** They are mentioned collectively as \"his Twelve\" (Book XII, line 440), but none other than Peter are mentioned by their individual names.\n*   **Old Testament Prophets:** Great prophets like Elijah, Isaiah, and Jeremiah are alluded to but not mentioned by name.\n*   **Context of Mention:** The question asks who is \"mentioned by name,\" not who Milton personally venerated. Therefore, the satirical mentions of Dominic and Francis count, as they are historical, canonized saints who are explicitly named in the text.\n\n### Final Tally\n\nBy summing the figures from each category, we arrive at the total number.\n*   Old Testament Saints: 16\n*   New Testament Saints: 2\n*   Post-Biblical Saints: 2\n\nTotal = 16 + 2 + 2 = 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
