    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the System and State**\nThe system is a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) box of length 'a'. The box extends from x = 0 to x = a. The particle is in the second energy eigenstate, which corresponds to the principal quantum number n = 2.\n\n**2. Write the Wavefunction and Probability Density**\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\nψ_n(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\n\nFor the n = 2 state, the wavefunction is:\nψ_2(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\nP(x) = |ψ_2(x)|² = (√(2/a) * sin(2πx / a))² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)\n\n**3. Set Up the Probability Integral**\nThe probability of finding the particle in a specific interval [x₁, x₂] is calculated by integrating the probability density over that interval.\nHere, the interval is from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a.\nThe probability, denoted as P(0.495a ≤ x ≤ 0.505a), is:\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx\n\n**4. Analyze the Interval and Choose an Approximation Method**\n*   The width of the interval is Δx = x₂ - x₁ = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a. This is a very small interval.\n*   The center of the interval is x_c = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a.\n*   For the n=2 state, the point x = 0.5a is a node, meaning the wavefunction and the probability density are zero at this point:\n    P(0.5a) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = 0.\n*   Since the interval is small and the function is zero at its center, a simple approximation P ≈ P(x_c) * Δx would incorrectly yield zero. We need a more accurate method, such as a Taylor expansion of the integrand.\n\n**5. Simplify the Integral using a Change of Variables**\nTo make the approximation easier, let's shift the coordinate system so the integral is centered at zero. Let y = x - 0.5a.\n*   The new variable is y. When x = 0.495a, y = -0.005a. When x = 0.505a, y = 0.005a.\n*   The integrand in terms of y is:\n    (2/a) * sin²(2π(y + 0.5a) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(2πy/a + π)\n*   Using the trigonometric identity sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ), we have sin²(θ + π) = [-sin(θ)]² = sin²(θ).\n*   So, the integrand becomes (2/a) * sin²(2πy/a).\n*   The integral is now:\n    P = ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πy/a) dy\n\n**6. Apply the Small-Angle Approximation**\nFor the small integration interval, the argument of the sine function, u = 2πy/a, is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation sin(u) ≈ u.\n*   The integrand is approximated as:\n    (2/a) * (2πy/a)² = (2/a) * (4π²y²/a²) = (8π²/a³) * y²\n*   The integral becomes:\n    P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (8π²/a³) * y² dy\n\n**7. Evaluate the Simplified Integral**\n*   First, pull the constant factor out of the integral:\n    P ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] y² dy\n*   Now, perform the integration: ∫y² dy = y³/3.\n    P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [y³/3] (evaluated from -0.005a to 0.005a)\n*   Substitute the limits of integration:\n    P ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\n    P ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [ (0.005a)³ + (0.005a)³ ]\n    P ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [ 2 * (0.005)³ * a³ ]\n*   The a³ terms cancel out:\n    P ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n*   Calculate (0.005)³:\n    (0.005)³ = (5 x 10⁻³)³ = 125 x 10⁻⁹ = 1.25 x 10⁻⁷\n*   Substitute this value back into the expression for P:\n    P ≈ (16π²/3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n*   Use the value of π² ≈ 9.8696:\n    P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n    P ≈ (157.9136 / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n    P ≈ 52.6379 * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)\n    P ≈ 65.797 * 10⁻⁷\n    P ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
