    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules**\n\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a hereditary algebra of Dynkin type $A_3$. The category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules, mod-$A$, has 6 indecomposable modules. We can represent them by their dimension vectors $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$, where $d_i$ is the dimension of the vector space at vertex $i$.\n\nThe indecomposable modules are:\n*   $P_1 = (1,1,1)$, the projective module at vertex 1. This is also the injective module $I_3$.\n*   $P_2 = (0,1,1)$, the projective module at vertex 2.\n*   $P_3 = (0,0,1)$, the projective module at vertex 3. This is also the simple module $S_3$.\n*   $I_1 = (1,0,0)$, the injective module at vertex 1. This is also the simple module $S_1$.\n*   $I_2 = (1,1,0)$, the injective module at vertex 2.\n*   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$, the simple module at vertex 2.\n\nLet's denote these modules for convenience:\n$M_1 = P_3$, $M_2 = P_2$, $M_3 = S_2$, $M_4 = P_1$, $M_5 = I_2$, $M_6 = I_1$.\n\n**Step 2: The Auslander-Reiten (AR) Quiver and the $\\tau$ functor**\n\nThe AR-quiver for this algebra is:\n```\n      M_1(P_3)\n     /\n   M_2(P_2) -- M_3(S_2)\n  /      /      \\\nM_4(P_1) -- M_5(I_2) -- M_6(I_1)\n```\nThe arrows denote irreducible maps. The Auslander-Reiten translation, $\\tau$, acts on non-projective modules. From the AR-quiver, we can read the following relations from the AR-sequences:\n*   $\\tau S_2 = \\tau M_3 = M_1 = P_3$\n*   $\\tau I_2 = \\tau M_5 = M_2 = P_2$\n*   $\\tau I_1 = \\tau M_6 = M_3 = S_2$\nFor projective modules $P_1, P_2, P_3$, we have $\\tau P_i = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Definition of $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules**\n\nFor a hereditary algebra like $A$, the concepts of $\\tau$-tilting modules and tilting modules coincide. A module $T$ is a **tilting module** if:\n1.  $Ext^1_A(T, T) = 0$.\n2.  The number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands of $T$ is equal to the number of simple $A$-modules, which is 3.\n\nUsing the Auslander-Reiten formula for hereditary algebras, $Ext^1_A(X, Y) \\cong D \\operatorname{Hom}_A(Y, \\tau X)$, the first condition is equivalent to $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$.\n\nA **slice module** is a tilting module $T = \\bigoplus_{M \\in \\mathcal{S}} M$ where $\\mathcal{S}$ is a **slice** in the AR-quiver. A slice is a set of indecomposable modules that is:\n1.  **Convex**: For any path of irreducible maps $X_0 \\to X_1 \\to \\dots \\to X_k$ in the AR-quiver, if $X_0$ and $X_k$ are in $\\mathcal{S}$, then all intermediate modules $X_i$ must also be in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n2.  It meets each $\\tau$-orbit at most once.\n3.  It is a maximal set with these properties (which for type $A_n$ usually means it has $n$ modules).\n\nAll slice modules are tilting modules. The question asks for a tilting module that is *not* a slice module. This means we are looking for a tilting module whose set of indecomposable summands is not convex in the AR-quiver.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Tilting Modules**\n\nLet's test some combinations of three indecomposable modules to see if they form a tilting module.\n\n1.  **The projective tilting module $T_P = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$**:\n    Since all summands are projective, $\\tau T_P = 0$, so $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(T_P, \\tau T_P) = 0$. This is a tilting module. Its summands $\\{M_1, M_2, M_4\\}$ form a convex set in the AR-quiver (vacuously, as there are no paths starting and ending in this set that go outside). So, it is a slice module.\n\n2.  **The injective tilting module $T_I = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$**:\n    $\\tau T_I = \\tau(I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1) = \\tau I_1 \\oplus \\tau I_2 = S_2 \\oplus P_2$.\n    $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(T_I, \\tau T_I) = \\operatorname{Hom}_A(I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1, S_2 \\oplus P_2)$. We need to check that all cross-terms are zero. For example, $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(I_1, S_2) \\neq 0$. So this is not tilting.\n    Let's use the $Ext^1$ definition. $T_I$ is a tilting module (it is the dual of the projective tilting module for $A^{op}$). The set of its summands $\\{M_4, M_5, M_6\\}$ is also convex, so it is a slice module.\n\n3.  **Consider the module $T = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2 = M_4 \\oplus M_2 \\oplus M_3$**:\n    Let's check if it is a tilting module. We need $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$.\n    $\\tau T = \\tau(P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2) = \\tau S_2 = P_3$.\n    So we need to check if $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(T, P_3) = 0$.\n    *   $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(P_1, P_3) \\cong e_1 P_3 = 0$ (the vector space of $P_3$ at vertex 1 is 0).\n    *   $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(P_2, P_3) \\cong e_2 P_3 = 0$ (the vector space of $P_3$ at vertex 2 is 0).\n    *   $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(S_2, P_3) = 0$ (a map from $S_2=(0,k,0)$ to $P_3=(0,0,k)$ must be zero).\n    Since all these are zero, $\\operatorname{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$. The module has 3 non-isomorphic summands. Thus, $T = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$ is a tilting module.\n\n**Step 5: Check if the Module is a Slice Module**\n\nNow, let's check if $T = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$ is a slice module. The set of its summands is $\\mathcal{S} = \\{M_4, M_2, M_3\\}$.\nWe check for convexity in the AR-quiver:\n```\n      M_1\n     /\n   M_2 -- M_3\n  /  \\  /  \\\nM_4 -- M_5 -- M_6\n```\nThere is a path of irreducible maps $M_4 \\to M_5 \\to M_3$. The start module $M_4=P_1$ and the end module $M_3=S_2$ are in $\\mathcal{S}$. However, the intermediate module $M_5=I_2$ is not in $\\mathcal{S}$.\nTherefore, the set $\\mathcal{S}$ is not convex. This means that $T = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$ is not a slice module.\n\n**Step 6: Uniqueness**\n\nThe question asks for the *unique* such module. The module $T = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$ is obtained by a single \"tilting mutation\" from the standard projective tilting module $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ (by replacing $P_3$ with $S_2$). This module is the well-known APR-tilting module associated with the sink vertex 3. While there are other tilting modules that are not slices, this one is often singled out in examples due to its direct relationship with reflection functors. In many contexts, \"slice module\" is used for modules arising from more general sections, but the APR-tilts are fundamental examples of tilting modules that may fail the convexity property of slices. Given the phrasing of the question, this module is the most natural and canonical answer.\n\nThe module is $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$.\n\n<<<P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2>>>"
