    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Core Subject:** Tracking Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n*   **Technology Used:** Photoplethysmography (PPG).\n*   **Measurement Captured:** Beat-to-beat intervals.\n*   **The Specific Question:** What is the name of the value computed *between* heartbeats, which is then used to calculate HRV?\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Concepts**\n\n*   **Heart Rate (HR):** This is the average number of times the heart beats in a minute (bpm). It's a measure of frequency. For example, 60 bpm means the heart beats, on average, once per second.\n*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is not the heart rate itself, but the measure of the *variation* in time between successive heartbeats. A healthy heart does not beat with perfect regularity; the time between beats constantly changes. HRV quantifies this variation.\n*   **Beat-to-beat interval:** This is the fundamental piece of data used to calculate both HR and HRV. It is the precise amount of time that passes from the peak of one heartbeat (or pulse wave) to the peak of the very next one. This time is typically measured in milliseconds (ms).\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Concepts to the Question**\n\n*   The question states that \"beat-to-beat intervals\" are captured.\n*   It then asks what the \"value between heartbeats\" is called.\n*   This value is the time duration of the beat-to-beat interval itself.\n*   This interval has a specific technical name.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Terminology**\n\n*   The time elapsed between two consecutive heartbeats is called the **Inter-Beat Interval**, commonly abbreviated as **IBI**.\n*   When measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG), the specific peaks are called \"R-waves,\" so the interval is often called the **R-R Interval**.\n*   When measured with PPG (as mentioned in the question), the peaks are from pulse waves, so the interval can also be called the **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI)**.\n*   However, **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** is the most common and general term used across different technologies to describe this fundamental measurement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHRV is not the interval itself, but a statistical calculation (like the standard deviation or RMSSD) performed on a series of these intervals. The raw value measured between each beat, which forms the basis for all HRV calculations, is the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI).\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
