    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. These are:\n    *   Helium (He)\n    *   Neon (Ne)\n    *   Argon (Ar)\n    *   Krypton (Kr)\n    *   Xenon (Xe)\n    *   Radon (Rn)\n    *   Oganesson (Og)\n\n2.  **Analyze the Scope of the Question:**\n    *   **\"Rarest\"**: This means the one with the lowest concentration or total mass.\n    *   **\"on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\"**: This requires us to consider the total amount of each gas on the entire planet (atmosphere, crust, mantle, etc.) relative to the Earth's total mass (approximately 5.97 x 10^24 kg).\n    *   **\"in 2002\"**: The abundances of naturally occurring elements do not change significantly over short timescales like a few decades. Therefore, the data from 2002 is effectively the same as current data for this purpose.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Noble Gas:**\n\n    *   **Oganesson (Og):** This is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth. It has only been created in a laboratory, and its atoms decay in milliseconds. Its natural abundance is zero. If synthetic elements are included, Oganesson is the rarest. However, questions about natural abundance typically refer to naturally occurring elements.\n\n    *   **Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe):** These are stable (or have very long-lived isotopes) and are primarily found in the atmosphere. Their abundances in the atmosphere by volume are approximately:\n        *   Argon: 0.93% (most abundant)\n        *   Neon: 18 parts per million (ppm)\n        *   Helium: 5.2 ppm\n        *   Krypton: 1.1 ppm\n        *   Xenon: 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion)\n        Of these five stable gases, **Xenon** is by far the rarest in the atmosphere.\n\n    *   **Radon (Rn):** This gas is unique among the naturally occurring noble gases because all of its isotopes are radioactive. It is continuously formed by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are found in the Earth's crust. However, Radon itself decays very quickly. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n\n4.  **Compare the Rarest Candidates (Xenon vs. Radon):**\n\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** Although its atmospheric concentration is very low (0.09 ppm), it is a stable element. The total mass of Xenon in Earth's atmosphere is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 kg (two trillion kilograms).\n    *   **Radon (Rn):** Because of its extremely short half-life, the total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any single moment is incredibly small. It is in a state of \"secular equilibrium,\" where its rate of creation is balanced by its rate of decay. Scientific estimates place the total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere at only a few kilograms, and the total across the entire planet (crust and atmosphere) at a few tens of kilograms at most.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   Comparing the total terrestrial mass of Xenon (~2,000,000,000,000 kg) with the total terrestrial mass of Radon (~20-30 kg), it is clear that **Radon** is many orders of magnitude rarer.\n    *   As a percentage of Earth's total mass, Radon's abundance is infinitesimally small, far smaller than Xenon's.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Natural vs. Synthetic:** The question can be interpreted in two ways. If it includes all elements on the periodic table, the answer is Oganesson (zero natural abundance). If it refers to naturally occurring elements, which is the standard interpretation for abundance questions, the answer is Radon.\n*   **Stable vs. Radioactive:** The key difference between Xenon and Radon is stability. Xenon is stable and has accumulated in the atmosphere over geological time. Radon is highly radioactive and exists only transiently.\n*   **Location of Abundance:** The question specifies \"all terrestrial matter,\" not just the atmosphere. While the atmosphere is the main reservoir for most noble gases, Radon is generated in the crust. Even accounting for Radon in the crust, its total mass remains minuscule compared to Xenon.\n\nBased on the analysis of naturally occurring elements, Radon is the rarest.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
