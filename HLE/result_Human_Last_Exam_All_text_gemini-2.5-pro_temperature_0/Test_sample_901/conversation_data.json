    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n    *   This is a secondary alkyl halide. The carbon atom bonded to the bromine (C1) is also bonded to two other carbon atoms (C2 and C6).\n    *   The leaving group is the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n    *   The stereochemistry is specified as (1S, 2R). We must determine the relative orientation of the bromo and methyl groups (*cis* or *trans*). By assigning priorities and determining the configuration on a planar ring model, we find that for the configuration to be (1S, 2R), the bromo group and the methyl group must be on the same side of the ring. Therefore, this is a **cis** isomer.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu).\n    *   This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. Its large size makes it a poor nucleophile.\n\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH).\n    *   This is a polar protic solvent that is the conjugate acid of the base.\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. Substitution reactions (SN1, SN2) are disfavored.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n\nCyclohexane derivatives exist as rapidly interconverting chair conformations. The E2 reaction has strict stereochemical requirements, so we must analyze these conformations.\n\n*   Since the substrate is a *cis*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, the two substituents (Br and CH₃) will be in an (axial, equatorial) or (equatorial, axial) arrangement.\n\n    *   **Conformation A:** Bromine is axial (a) and the methyl group is equatorial (e).\n    *   **Conformation B:** Bromine is equatorial (e) and the methyl group is axial (a).\n\n*   **Determine the More Stable Conformation:** We compare the stability by considering the steric strain (A-values) of axial substituents. The A-value for a methyl group (~1.7 kcal/mol) is significantly larger than that for a bromine atom (~0.4-0.6 kcal/mol). To minimize steric strain, the larger group (methyl) prefers the equatorial position.\n    *   Therefore, **Conformation A (Br-axial, CH₃-equatorial) is the more stable and predominant conformation** at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Stereochemical Requirement for the E2 Reaction**\n\n*   The E2 mechanism requires a concerted process where the base removes a beta-proton while the leaving group departs. This requires the beta-proton and the leaving group to be **anti-periplanar**, which in a cyclohexane ring means they must be in a **trans-diaxial** orientation (one axial-up, the other axial-down).\n\n*   **Analyze Reactivity of Each Conformer:**\n    *   **Conformation B (Br-equatorial):** The leaving group (Br) is in an equatorial position. There are no beta-protons that are trans-diaxial to it. Therefore, **this conformer cannot undergo an E2 reaction.**\n    *   **Conformation A (Br-axial):** The leaving group (Br) is in an axial position. This conformation can undergo an E2 reaction if there is an available beta-proton in an axial position on an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n\n**Step 4: Identify Possible Elimination Pathways and Predict the Major Product**\n\nThe reaction must proceed through Conformation A, which is fortunately also the major conformer. In this conformation, the Br is axial. We now look for axial protons on the adjacent beta-carbons (C2 and C6).\n\n*   **Beta-proton at C2:** In Conformation A, the methyl group at C2 is equatorial. This means the hydrogen atom at C2 is **axial**. This axial proton is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination of this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   Product: **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a trisubstituted alkene (more substituted), known as the **Zaitsev product**.\n\n*   **Beta-proton at C6:** The carbon at C6 has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial** proton is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination of this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   Product: **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a disubstituted alkene (less substituted), known as the **Hofmann product**.\n\n*   **Determine Regioselectivity (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann):** The choice between these two pathways depends on the base.\n    *   Small, strong bases (e.g., ethoxide) favor the thermodynamically more stable, more substituted Zaitsev product.\n    *   Large, bulky bases like **potassium tert-butoxide** are sensitive to steric hindrance. They preferentially abstract the most sterically accessible proton.\n    *   The proton at C6 is on a -CH₂- group and is much more accessible than the proton at C2, which is on a carbon bearing a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky tert-butoxide base will preferentially remove the proton from C6, leading to the Hofmann product.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide proceeds via an E2 mechanism on the more stable conformer where the bromine is axial. Due to the bulky nature of the base, the reaction favors the abstraction of the less sterically hindered proton at C6, leading to the formation of the less substituted alkene.\n\nThe major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
