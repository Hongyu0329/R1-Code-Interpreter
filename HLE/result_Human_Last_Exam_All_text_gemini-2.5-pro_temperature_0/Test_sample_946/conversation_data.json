    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific fictional singer. The key details are:\n*   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event:** The Junior prom.\n*   **Object:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Role:** The cutout is the \"musical guest\" or performer.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the specific scene in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThe episode focuses on the Teen Girl Squad (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) going to their Junior Prom. During the prom scene, the musical entertainment is revealed.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the on-screen information during the prom scene.**\n*   A panel appears with the text: \"musical guest: a cardboard cutout of some singer\".\n*   The next panel shows a stage with a cardboard cutout of a male rock singer with spiky hair, holding a microphone.\n*   A caption at the bottom of this panel explicitly names the singer.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name provided in the cartoon.**\nThe caption below the cardboard cutout reads \"ARROWED!\". This is the name of the fictional singer.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **It is a cutout, not a character:** The question correctly specifies it's a cardboard cutout. The humor comes from the fact that the prom's musical guest is an inanimate object.\n*   **The \"performance\":** The cutout's only action is a speech bubble that says \"p'shooow!\", which is a sound effect, not a song.\n*   **\"ARROWED!\" is a recurring joke:** The name \"ARROWED!\" is a callback to an earlier \"Strong Bad Email\" episode (\"different town\") where Strong Bad's method of dealing with a cool guy is to have him get \"ARROWED!\" by an archer. The name became a running gag, representing a generic or clich√©d rock star.\n*   **Fictional within a fiction:** \"ARROWED!\" is a fictional singer within the fictional world of \"Homestar Runner\", which is itself a work of fiction.\n\nBy following these steps and paying attention to the details presented directly in the cartoon, we can confidently identify the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<ARROWED!>>>"
