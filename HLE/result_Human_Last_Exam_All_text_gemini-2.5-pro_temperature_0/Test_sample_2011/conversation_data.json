    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are working with a graph `G` that has a set of `V` vertices, where `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is often denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** An induced subgraph on a subset of vertices `S` from a graph `G` is a new graph formed by the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** The phrase \"a clique of size `k` appears as an induced subgraph\" means that there is a set of `k` vertices in the graph such that the subgraph induced by these `k` vertices is a complete graph `K_k`. This is the standard definition of a clique in a graph.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the maximum possible value for `m`, where `m` is the number of different clique sizes `{k_1, k_2, ..., k_m}` that can all exist in a single graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Set of Clique Sizes**\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary graph `G`. Let `S(G)` be the set of all integers `k` for which `G` contains a clique of size `k`. We want to find a graph `G` on 128 vertices for which `|S(G)|` is as large as possible.\n\nLet `k_max` be the size of the largest clique in `G`. This value is known as the **clique number** of `G`, denoted `ω(G)`.\n\n*   By definition, `k_max` is in the set `S(G)`.\n*   Now, consider this largest clique, let's call it `C_max`. It consists of `k_max` vertices that are all mutually connected.\n*   If we take any subset of `k` vertices from `C_max` (where `1 ≤ k < k_max`), these `k` vertices will also be mutually connected.\n*   Therefore, this subset of `k` vertices forms a clique of size `k`.\n*   This means that if a graph has a clique of size `k_max`, it must also have cliques of all smaller integer sizes: `k_max-1`, `k_max-2`, ..., `2`, `1`.\n\nThis leads to a crucial insight: for any graph `G`, the set of its clique sizes `S(G)` is not just any set of numbers, but is always a continuous set of integers of the form `{1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\n**3. Reframing the Problem**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, the number of different clique sizes in any graph `G` is simply equal to its clique number, `ω(G)`.\n\nTherefore, the original question:\n\"Determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes...\"\nis equivalent to the simpler question:\n\"Determine the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` on `n=128` vertices.\"\n\n**4. Solving the Reframed Problem**\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n*   A clique is a subset of the graph's vertices.\n*   Therefore, the size of any clique cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph.\n*   For a graph with `n=128` vertices, the clique number `ω(G)` must be less than or equal to 128. So, `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n\nNow, we must check if this maximum value is achievable. Can we construct a graph `G` on 128 vertices that has a clique number of 128?\n\n*   Yes, we can. Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_128`.\n*   In `K_128`, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n*   The entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique.\n*   Therefore, the clique number of `K_128` is `ω(K_128) = 128`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128. Since the number of different clique sizes is equal to the clique number, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is also 128.\n\nFor the graph `G = K_128`, the set of clique sizes is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`, and the number of elements in this set is 128.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **No Disjointness Requirement:** The problem does not state that the cliques of different sizes must be vertex-disjoint. The cliques can overlap. For instance, in `K_128`, a clique of size 127 is a subgraph of the clique of size 128. This interpretation is key. If disjointness were required, the answer would be much smaller (it would be 15, from solving `1+2+...+m ≤ 128`).\n2.  **Induced Subgraph vs. Subgraph:** For cliques, the distinction is not critical, as any subgraph that is a `K_k` is also an induced `K_k`. The wording is precise but doesn't change the nature of the problem.\n3.  **The Structure of Clique Sizes:** The most important logical step is realizing that the set of clique sizes in any graph is always of the form `{1, 2, ..., k}` for some `k`. This transforms the problem from a potentially complex combinatorial one into a simple question about the maximum clique number.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n<<<128>>>"
