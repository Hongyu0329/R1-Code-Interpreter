    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry and Orientation**\n*   The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical faces, each being an equilateral triangle. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n*   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its 20 triangular faces is horizontal and forms the base of the tank.\n*   This orientation is important because it defines the vertical axis. The vertical axis is a line perpendicular to the base face, passing through its center and the center of the icosahedron. This axis is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Position of the Water Surface**\n*   The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   A regular icosahedron is a centrally symmetric object. Its geometric center is a point of inversion, meaning any plane passing through this center divides the icosahedron into two parts of equal volume.\n*   Since the tank's base is horizontal, the water surface will also be a horizontal plane. For the water to fill exactly half the volume, this horizontal plane must pass through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Shape of the Water Surface**\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by cutting the icosahedron with this specific plane.\n*   Based on the previous steps, the water surface is the cross-section formed by a plane that:\n    1.  Passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n    2.  Is parallel to a face (the base face).\n    3.  Is therefore perpendicular to a 3-fold symmetry axis.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Cross-Section**\n*   The shape of a central cross-section of a regular polyhedron depends on the orientation of the cutting plane relative to its symmetry axes.\n*   For an icosahedron:\n    *   A central plane perpendicular to a 5-fold axis (an axis through two opposite vertices) creates a regular pentagon.\n    *   A central plane perpendicular to a 2-fold axis (an axis through the midpoints of two opposite edges) creates a regular decagon.\n    *   A central plane perpendicular to a 3-fold axis (an axis through the centers of two opposite faces) creates a **regular hexagon**.\n*   Our situation matches the third case. The icosahedron stands on a face, so the vertical axis is a 3-fold axis. The water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center.\n\n**Step 5: Visualize the Result**\n*   When the icosahedron is oriented on a face, its 12 vertices are arranged in four horizontal layers of three vertices each. The central cutting plane passes between the two middle layers.\n*   The plane intersects the six edges that connect these two middle layers.\n*   Due to the high degree of symmetry, the intersection points on these six edges form the vertices of a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron, perpendicular to the 3-fold axis defined by the base. This cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
