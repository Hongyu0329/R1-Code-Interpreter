    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the two high school buildings in Pisa.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subjects:** The question asks about two specific high schools in Pisa, Italy: the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini.\n2.  **Identify the Key Condition:** The question specifies that the schools are \"next to each other\" and that the letter shape is visible \"if seen from above.\" This means we need to use an aerial or satellite view, such as one from Google Maps or Google Earth.\n3.  **Locate the Schools:** A search on a map service for \"Istituto Ulisse Dini, Pisa\" and \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, Pisa\" confirms they are indeed located directly adjacent to one another on Via Benedetto Croce.\n4.  **Examine the Aerial View:**\n    *   Switching to the satellite view on a map, we can see the layout of the buildings.\n    *   The building for the Liceo Scientifico 'Ulisse Dini' is a long, straight structure. This forms a clear vertical line.\n    *   The main building for the ITIS 'Galilei' - IPSIA 'Pacinotti' is also a long, straight structure. It is positioned at a right angle to the Dini building, running along its southern end. This forms a clear horizontal line.\n5.  **Combine the Shapes:** When you look at the two main buildings together from above, the long vertical block of the Ulisse Dini and the long horizontal block of the Galilei-Pacinotti at its base form a distinct shape.\n6.  **Determine the Letter:** A vertical line connected to a horizontal line at its base forms the shape of the letter **L**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Exact Location:** It is crucial to confirm that the two schools are physically adjacent, which they are.\n*   **Perspective:** The \"seen from above\" instruction is the most important part of the question, as the shape is not apparent from the ground.\n*   **Main Buildings:** The analysis focuses on the primary, largest structures of each school that create the overall shape, ignoring smaller, detached buildings like gyms or annexes that do not contribute to the main form.\n*   **Orientation:** The specific orientation of the buildings—one vertical and one horizontal, joined at the corner—is what creates the recognizable letter.\n\nBy following these steps and observing the satellite imagery, the conclusion is clear.\n\n<<<L>>>"
