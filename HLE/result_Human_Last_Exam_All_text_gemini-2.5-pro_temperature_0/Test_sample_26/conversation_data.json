    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object $X$\n*   $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in the complex projective 3-space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. It is defined by the zero set of a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   The complex dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 3. The complex dimension of the hypersurface $X$ is $3-1=2$.\n*   As a real manifold, $X$ has dimension $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Betti numbers of $X$\nThe Betti numbers $b_k(X) = \\text{rank}(H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z}))$ are essential for understanding the topology of $X$.\n\n1.  **$b_0, b_1, b_3, b_4$**:\n    *   Since $X$ is smooth, it is connected, so $b_0(X) = 1$.\n    *   By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the inclusion $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces an isomorphism $i_*: H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, $H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, which implies $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and thus $b_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   $X$ is a compact, oriented 4-manifold, so by Poincar√© Duality, $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$.\n    *   $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$.\n    *   $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n\n2.  **$b_2$**:\n    *   To find $b_2(X)$, we can compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^4 (-1)^k b_k(X)$.\n    *   $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic can also be computed by integrating the top Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$. For a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the Euler characteristic is given by a known formula. For a surface ($n=3$), this is $\\chi(X_d) = \\frac{d}{6}((d-5)^2 d + 11d - 30) + 2$. For $d=5$:\n        $\\chi(X_5) = \\frac{5}{6}((5-5)^2 \\cdot 5 + 11 \\cdot 5 - 30) + 2 = \\frac{5}{6}(0 + 55 - 30) + 2 = \\frac{5 \\cdot 25}{6} + 2$. This formula seems incorrect or misremembered.\n    *   Let's compute it from the adjunction formula. The total Chern class of the tangent bundle $T_X$ is $c(T_X) = i^* c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}) / c(N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3})$, where $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the inclusion and $N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3}$ is the normal bundle.\n        *   $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = (1+h)^4 = 1+4h+6h^2+4h^3$, where $h$ is the hyperplane class.\n        *   $N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3} = \\mathcal{O}_X(5)$, so $c(N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = 1+5h|_X$.\n        *   $c(T_X) = i^*((1+4h+6h^2+\\dots)(1-5h+25h^2-\\dots)) = 1 - h|_X + 11(h|_X)^2 + \\dots$.\n        *   The second Chern class is $c_2(T_X) = 11(h|_X)^2$.\n        *   The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X) = \\int_X 11(h|_X)^2 = 11 \\cdot \\deg(X) = 11 \\cdot 5 = 55$.\n    *   Now we can find $b_2$: $55 = 2 + b_2 \\implies b_2 = 53$.\n\nSo, the Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = (1, 0, 53, 0, 1)$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Homology and Homotopy Groups\n*   For a smooth projective complete intersection (a hypersurface is a case of this), the integral homology groups are torsion-free.\n*   $H_0(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$\n*   $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   Since $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, $X$ is simply connected, so $\\pi_1(X) = 0$.\n*   By the Hurewicz Theorem, since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, the Hurewicz map $h_2: \\pi_2(X) \\to H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n### Step 4: Use the Whitehead Exact Sequence\nTo find $\\pi_3(X)$, we use a result of J.H.C. Whitehead that relates homotopy and homology for highly connected spaces. For a 1-connected space $X$ with $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, there is a natural exact sequence:\n$$ H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\eta} \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) \\xrightarrow{w} \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\n\n1.  **Identify the terms in the sequence**:\n    *   $H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n    *   $\\Gamma(G)$ is the Whitehead quadratic functor. For a free abelian group $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r$, $\\Gamma(G)$ is a free abelian group of rank $\\binom{r}{2}$.\n    *   So, $\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) = \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$ is a free abelian group of rank $\\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 \\times 26 = 1378$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the map $\\eta$**:\n    *   The map $\\eta: H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$ is determined by the cup product pairing on the second cohomology group, $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\times H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^4(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   The cup product form on $X$ is non-trivial. For instance, let $h|_X \\in H^2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ be the restriction of the hyperplane class. The self-intersection is $\\int_X (h|_X) \\cup (h|_X) = \\int_X (h|_X)^2 = \\deg(X) = 5 \\neq 0$.\n    *   Since the cup product form is non-zero, the map $\\eta$ is non-zero.\n    *   The domain of $\\eta$ is $H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The codomain $\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$ is a free abelian group (and thus torsion-free). A non-zero homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to a torsion-free group must be injective.\n    *   Therefore, $\\text{Im}(\\eta) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **Compute the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**:\n    *   From the exact sequence, we have $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) / \\text{Im}(\\eta)$.\n    *   So, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{1378} / \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The rank of a quotient of free abelian groups is the difference of their ranks.\n    *   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))) - \\text{rank}(\\text{Im}(\\eta))$.\n    *   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 1378 - 1 = 1377$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1377.\n\n<<<1377>>>"
