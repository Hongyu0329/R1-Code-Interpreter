    "This problem asks for the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the necessary definitions\n\n*   **Complete Bipartite Graph $K_{m,n}$**: This is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, let's call them $U$ and $V$, with $|U|=m$ and $|V|=n$. Every vertex in $U$ is connected to every vertex in $V$ by an edge, and there are no edges within $U$ or within $V$. In our case, we have $K_{1000,1000}$, so $m=1000$ and $n=1000$. The total number of vertices is $1000+1000=2000$. The degree of every vertex in this graph is 1000.\n\n*   **Orientation of a Graph**: An orientation $D$ of a graph $G$ is obtained by assigning a direction to each edge, turning it into a directed graph. For a vertex $v$, $d_D^+(v)$ is its out-degree (number of outgoing edges) and $d_D^-(v)$ is its in-degree (number of incoming edges).\n\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph**: A subgraph is Eulerian if every vertex in it has an even degree. When considering an orientation $D$, a subgraph $H$ is called Eulerian if for every vertex $v$, its in-degree in $H$ equals its out-degree in $H$. Let $EE(D)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, and $EO(D)$ be the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges.\n\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number $AT(G)$**: The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$ is defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that:\n    1.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$. That is, $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all $v \\in V(G)$.\n    2.  The number of even-sized Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd-sized Eulerian subgraphs. That is, $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n    An equivalent way to state this is:\n    $AT(G) = 1 + \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ for which $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Find an upper bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ that satisfies $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$, and then calculate its maximum out-degree.\n\n1.  **Construct an orientation $D$**: Let the two partitions of $K_{1000,1000}$ be $U$ and $V$. Let's orient all edges to go from vertices in $U$ to vertices in $V$.\n2.  **Calculate out-degrees**:\n    *   For any vertex $u \\in U$, it is connected to all 1000 vertices in $V$. Since all these edges are oriented away from $u$, its out-degree is $d_D^+(u) = 1000$.\n    *   For any vertex $v \\in V$, all edges connected to it are oriented towards it. Thus, its out-degree is $d_D^+(v) = 0$.\n3.  **Find the maximum out-degree**: The maximum out-degree in this orientation is $\\max(1000, 0) = 1000$.\n4.  **Check the Eulerian subgraph condition**: We need to determine if $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ for this orientation. An Eulerian subgraph $H$ of $D$ must have $d_H^+(x) = d_H^-(x)$ for every vertex $x$.\n    *   In our orientation $D$, vertices in $U$ only have outgoing edges, and vertices in $V$ only have incoming edges.\n    *   For any non-empty subgraph $H$, if it contains an edge $(u,v)$ with $u \\in U, v \\in V$, then $d_H^+(u) \\ge 1$ but $d_H^-(u) = 0$. So $d_H^+(u) \\neq d_H^-(u)$.\n    *   The only way for the condition $d_H^+(x) = d_H^-(x)$ to hold for all vertices is if the subgraph $H$ has no edges. This is the empty subgraph.\n    *   The empty subgraph has 0 edges. Since 0 is an even number, the empty subgraph is an even-sized Eulerian subgraph.\n    *   Therefore, for this orientation $D$, we have $EE(D) = 1$ (the empty subgraph) and $EO(D) = 0$.\n5.  **Determine the upper bound**: Since $EE(D) = 1 \\neq EO(D) = 0$, this orientation is valid. The maximum out-degree is 1000. According to the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number, $k$ must be strictly greater than the maximum out-degree. So, we must have $k > 1000$. The smallest integer $k$ is 1001. This gives us an upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1001$.\n\n### Step 3: Find a lower bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find a lower bound, we need to show that no orientation with a smaller maximum out-degree can satisfy the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n1.  **Consider an arbitrary orientation $D'$**: Let's assume there is an orientation $D'$ where the maximum out-degree is less than 1000. This means $d_{D'}^+(v) \\le 999$ for all vertices $v$.\n2.  **Use a key theorem**: There is a theorem by Noga Alon which states that if an orientation $D$ of a graph $G$ has the property that every vertex has a non-zero in-degree (i.e., $d_D^-(v) \\ge 1$ for all $v$), then $EE(D) = EO(D)$.\n3.  **Apply the theorem to our case**:\n    *   The degree of every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000.\n    *   For any vertex $v$, its total degree is the sum of its in-degree and out-degree in any orientation $D'$: $d_{D'}^+(v) + d_{D'}^-(v) = 1000$.\n    *   Our assumption is that $d_{D'}^+(v) \\le 999$ for all $v$.\n    *   This implies that the in-degree of any vertex $v$ is $d_{D'}^-(v) = 1000 - d_{D'}^+(v) \\ge 1000 - 999 = 1$.\n    *   So, in any orientation where the maximum out-degree is at most 999, every vertex must have an in-degree of at least 1.\n4.  **Draw the conclusion for the lower bound**: Based on Alon's theorem, any such orientation $D'$ must have $EE(D') = EO(D')$. This means it does not satisfy the condition for the Alon-Tarsi number. Therefore, to find an orientation $D$ with $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$, we must have $\\max_v d_D^+(v) \\ge 1000$.\n    From the definition $AT(G) = 1 + \\min \\{ \\max d_D^+(v) \\}$, this implies $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 1 + 1000 = 1001$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the bounds to get the final answer\n\nFrom Step 2, we found that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1001$.\nFrom Step 3, we found that $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 1001$.\n\nCombining these two results, we can conclude that the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is exactly 1001.\n\nThis result is a specific case of the general formula for complete bipartite graphs $K_{m,n}$, which is $AT(K_{m,n}) = \\min(m, n) + 1$. For $K_{1000,1000}$, this gives $\\min(1000, 1000) + 1 = 1000 + 1 = 1001$.\n\n<<<1001>>>"
